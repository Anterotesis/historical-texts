BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HOGARTH  BY MR HARRISON  THAT truly original genius the celebrated WILLIAM HOGARTH was born in London in After re∣ceiving a tolerable education he was apprenticed to an en∣graver of arms and cyphers on plate usually called a silver engraver but the powerful impulse of genius directed his studies to painting  Much of his early life was past in obscurity He chiefly employed his talents in designing and engraving for the book∣sellers who were then much worse patrons of the arts than they have since proved He also painted family pictures and portraits in all which performances he evinced more ability than he acquired reward  But his originality in the mean time was maturing to per∣fection He pursued Nature through her infinity and con∣templated her not through the opticks of imitation but with his own sedulous and critical eye Whenever he beheld a re∣markable countenance or witnessed any striking occurrence he was accustomed by the immediate use of his pencil to pre∣serve it's remembrance  In he married the only daughter of Sir James Thorn∣hill This union was indeed a stolen one But the growing reputation of Hogarth at length effected a reconciliation with his fatherinlaw and his Harlot's Progress published in announced to the publick the rich acquisition of a Comick Painter  His merit now became conspicuous and his pencil acquired at every exertion additional reputation His Marriage Alamode produced in gave rise to the celebrated comedy of the Clandestine Marriage  In he wrote his Analysis of Beauty In this work he proves by a variety of examples that "a curve is the line of beauty and that round swelling figures are most pleasing to the eye" An opinion which has been confirmed by subsequent writers  The close of his life was embittered by a satirical conten∣tion with Churchill and Mr Wilkes Hogarth caricatured Churchill and Churchill sampooned Hogarth "Never" says Lord Orford "did two angry men of their abilities throw mud with less dexterity"  He was now visibly declining in health and died Octo∣ber  This great artist has the glory of forming a school and the master remains unrivalled by his scholars He paints to the understanding and the heart and his pictures may serve as annals of the manners of the age He is in Painting what Fielding is in Romance or Moliere in Comedy  Hogarth was buried at Chiswick and the following Epi∣taph written by his friend Garrick is engraved on a neat pyramidical monument  "Farewel great Painter of Mankind  Who reach'd the noblest point of Art  Whose Pictur'd Morals charm the Mind  And through the Eye correct the Heart  If Genius fire thee Reader stay  If Nature touch thee drop a tear  If neither move thee turn away  For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here"  When the Memorial on which these elegant lines are in∣scribed shall have long been crumbled into dust the Works of Hogarth will be admired if the love of merit then exists in the world  With the Description of some Print from these inestimable Works as well as a faithful Copy of the Print itself we shall commence our respective Numbers  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE I THE FELLOW'PRENTICES AT THEIR LOOMS  THE design of this Series of Prints is of the first import∣ance to youth in a commercial nation They are called INDUSTRY and IDLENESS "exemplified" to use Hogarth's  own words "in the conduct of Two Fellow'Prentices where the one by taking good courses and pursuing points for which he was put apprentice becomes a valuable man and an ornament to his countrythe other by giving way to idle∣ness naturally falls into poverty and ends fatally as is ex∣pressed in the last print" He adds that "lest any print should be mistaken the description of each is engraved"  The quotations from Scripture applied to the different scenes are said to have been selected by Hogarth's friend the Rev Mr Arnold King The passages for this First Plate are    "The drunkard shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall cloath a man with rags"  Proverbs xxiii    "The hand of the diligent maketh rich"  Proverbs x  This interesting history to use the language of the drama opens with a scene which presents to the spectator our two heroes the fellowapprentices seated in the looms of their ma∣ster a respectable silkmanufacturer of Spitalfields One of them who is depicted with an ingenuous and pleasing counte∣nance appears diligently and attentively employed in weaving while the other whose features express an abject groveling mind while his dress denotes neligence and sloth sits fast asleep in a seeming state of intoxication This idea is con∣firmed by the tankard and tobaccopipe and his ruling pas∣sions are farther developed by the ballad of  "Moll Flanders"  c on the wall by the torn pamphlet of  "The Prentices Guide"  and by the kitten's apparently familiar acquaintance with the unemployed shuttle which has dropped from his hand and serves the animal for a plaything The Master who is seen entering expresses an inclination to correct the idle apprentice with his uplifted cane but seems restrained by reflecting on the little good to be expected from any chastisement of a lad in whom vicious habits are so deeply rooted The disposition of the good youth is contrasted with that of his fellowapprentice by the choice of those excellent old ballads  "Turn again Whit∣tington"  and  "The Valiant 'Prentice"  as well as by the clean and perfect state in which he has preserved his copy of  "The 'Prentices Guide"  LAWS OF LAUGHING  LAUGHING is that noble faculty which distinguishes man from beast since it shews the rationality of the soul which can be moved independent of the senses It is the mark of reason the badge of goodhumour and the sign of mirth Shakspeare says  "The man who hath not Musick in himself  And is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds  Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils"  And we may with great truth apply the same remark to  The man who has not Mirth within himself  And can't be mov'd to laughter by a joke  It is said of the Roman Cassius that  "He seldom smil'd or smil'd in such a sort  As if he scorn'd himself that could be mov'd  To smile at any thing"  Now this fellow Cassius always lived a melancholy life and at last died a murderer but the man who lives laughing ge∣nerally dies in his bed as an honest man ought  With respect to laughing we should consider three things first who laughs secondly who is laughed at and thirdly what the laughing is about  When a man tells a merry tale he should laugh inwardly and enjoy the joke in his mind more than in his countenance for he who laughs aloud at his own joke is in the court of Comus considered as a sool  When a merry story is ended you may be allowed to make a little noise in laughing as it shews your approbation of what was meant for your entertainment but never break into the middle of a story by loud laughter such interruptions being very disagreeable to the company as well as to the speaker and all the merry ammunition should be preserved for the conclusion  Laughing not only increases the goodhumour of society and promotes social enjoyment but it is of infinite service to the health and has sometimes saved the lives of sick persons  The famous Doctor Radcliffe was once sent for into the country by a gentleman who was dangerously ill of a quinsey and soon perceiving that no application would be of service he desired the cook to make a large hastypudding and let his servant bring it up While the cook was engaged in this bu∣siness he took his man aside and instructed him The man accordingly brought up the pudding in great order and set it on the table in full view of the patient "Come John" said the doctor "you love hastypudding eat some with me for I believe you came out without your breakfast" Both then fell to with their spoons but John's going twice to his mouth to his master's once the doctor took occasion to quarrel with him by dabbing a spoonful of hot pudding in his face John threw another at his master who apparently in a violent pas∣sion quitted his spoon took the hastypudding up by handfuls and threw it at his man who battled him again in the same  manner till they were both all over in a woeful pickle The gentleman having a full view of this comical combat was so delighted at it that he burst into a most immoderate fit of laughter which broke the quinsey and compleatly cured him  "Laugh and be fat" is a common saying therefore I would recommend laughing to the consumptive illconditioned and splenetick as the certain cure of their disorders When we are laughed at we should never be angry as that serves only to increase the laughter of those who jeer us The only way is to retort jest for jest and joke for joke and when a story is told to expose any of our follies we should not only take the hint to amend them but endeavour at the same time to expose by an apposite story some folly peculiar to the per∣son who attempted to expose us that he may likewise come in for his share of improvement Thus laughing will be of mutual benefit and goodhumour and instruction go hand in hand Besides a retort has great force since it not only takes away the sting of a former jest but establishes our reputation for a ready turn of wit  Thus when the pay of a certain regiment in France had been kept back for a long time and one of the officers being greatly pressed for money and much discontented went to the colonel saying"Three words with you Sirmoney or dis∣charge" The latter immediately replied"Four with you Sirneither one nor t'other"  But as we may not always be able to parry the sarcasms of wit with success we should endeavour to gain such an ascen∣dancy over our passions as to be always in a good humour with ourselves The tranquillity of our own minds will prove the best desence against the worst attacks  I shall conclude these remarks with a short story which every reader may apply as he pleases  When gods and goddesses made frequent visits to mankind a beautiful and young roving divinity went into a nation of hunchback people On entering the capital he was sur∣rounded by a multitude of the inhabitants who derided him most unmercifully for having what they deemed so odious a form and would have proceeded to still greater violence had not one wiser than the rest suddenly cried out"My friends and countrymen consider well what you are doing Let us not insult this unhappy piece of deformi  y If Heaven has lavished on us all the gifts of beauty if it has adorned our backs with a noble mountain of flesh let us be filled with gratitude repair to our temples and return thanks to the immortal Gods" This is the history of human vanity for to succeed in any country we must carry the hunch of the nation into which we travel  PLEASURES OF BEING IN DEBT  BY ARTHUR MURPHY ESQ  I Hope you will not refuse place to a correspondent who means to shew the futility of a maxim which has gained credit with most people though extremely illgrounded as I think I can fairly evince from an experimental knowledge of mankind  You undoubtedly recollect that Ovid has in one of his Ele∣gies the following lines  "Donec eris felix multos numerabis Amicos  Tempora si fuerint nubila folus eris"  Now it is so far from being true that a man is surrounded with friends in prosperity and is left destitute under his mis∣fortunes that I will undertake to prove the very reverse in doing this I flatter myself I shall serve the purposes of virtue and vindicate the dignity of human nature  You must know then that I came to this town a few years since with intent to read the law having just fortune enough to support me in my studies until I might fix myself in a tole∣rable road of business For this purpose I lodged in one of the Inns of Court and the oeconomy which I was obliged to observe rendering it impossible for me to go much into com∣pany I soon found out that I led a very muzzy sort of a life I therefore shifted the scene and though in a short time I found means to run out my little fortune I cannot say that I was relinquished by the world on this account It is true that some of my acquaintance totally deserted me but it was the occasion at the same time that others were more earnestly attached than they would otherwise have been I remember the last word my aunt in the country said to me was"Bob wherever you go be sure to make friends for yourself" This advice I will venture to say I have had the address to conform to with great success as will appear from the sequel  Most of the friendships of the world are leagues in debauch∣ery and intemperance made in the drawing of a cork and often ended in the same manner  "Out of sight out of mind"  is cer∣tainly true with regard to the generality of connections but the impressions I have made on the minds of my friends are not so easily effaced on the contrary when it happens that I am seldom seen by them they are known to be in very great solicitude about me are constantly very earnest in their en∣quiries after me and the discourse they usually have with each other is"Have you seen our old friend lately I can't think what's become of him I hope he is not gone out of  townI have not seen him for a long timeFaith I am very uneasy about himI wish to God he would see and settle his affairsHe's a very careless young fellowa great deal too wildthrows away his money like dirtI have called upon him morning after morning but all to no purposeI'd give a bottle of wine I could meet with himI'd rather that than my dinnerI never longed so much to see any body"  These are the general expressions of anxiety which my friends express on my account and there are some of them who are not content to rest herewords cost nothing they carry the thing to such a length as to employ a couple of fellows who are daily in all quarters of the town hunting and prying about for me As there are few instances of such earnest friendship in the world I am sensible what I have said may have a romantick appearance and the reader may sug∣gest to himself that I am entertaining him all this while with a novel but I must take leave to assure you that every word is literally true and what may perhaps raise your idea still higher not one of all these people has ever got a shilling by me and I verily believe few of them ever will Having said thus much in the praise of these my wellwishers it will naturally be desired of me to inform the world who and what they are who are in such concern about a stranger Not to keep you any longer in suspence I will now tell you that I have experienced all this generosity from my Creditors  By this it will appear that the pleasure of being in debt though very common in life is very little understood by the generality of those who addict themselves to this gratification The art in all these cases is to refine upon the occurrences and disappointments to which our state is liable and for my part the pleasure just mentioned is one of the most valuable enjoyments of my life My morning levee is as great as any nobleman's whereas in the days that I could say I was in possession of a competence I never had any visitor whatever except a laundress to make my bed in the Temple But now the case is perfectly altered there is a constant crowd of atten∣dants about my doors and to those that are admitted I have the pleasure of making as many promises as a minister of state besides a losty pride in keeping them much after the same fashion Upon these occasions it will now and then happen that they who best know how to make their court and have the art of taking a pliant hour sometimes prevail upon me to appoint a day for the completion of their wishes As things of consequence cannot be done in a violent hurry the day agreed upon is generally very distant may be from six to nine or twelve months during which space of time it is observ∣able  that their goodnature never suffers the least abatement but they remain as solicitous as ever frequently expressing the most tender regard for my welfare "My dear Sir do take a little care of yourselfIt goes to my very heart to hear you cough so hardWhy you'll not live three months at this rateBe advised by me and put a stocking about your neck tonight and take something to sweat you a little and ease your chest You should not drink so muchConsider it im∣pairs both constitution and purseYou know it's for your good I speakYou'd be a great loss to your friendsTake up a little flesh and blood can't hold it always"  Thus Sir am I beloved and that for no other reason but my address in making friends for myself and I am so closely watched by these generous creatures that it is totally out of my power to take any wrong step that might be detrimental to my affairs Of this I had a convincing proof about a year ago when the interposition of my taylor hindered me from committing a very inconsiderate action I was going with a friend to take a trip to Paris by which expedient I must cer∣tainly have been drained of all my readymoney but the vi∣gilance of my friend contrived to have me stopped as I was just stepping into the postchaise and I was thence conducted to a generous bailiff's house in Gray's Inn Lane for the sum of three hundred pounds Here I remained confined till my passion for travel was perfectly cooled and when I was at length restored to my liberty my abovementioned friends took particular care not to leave me a single shilling for fear I should have the same unhappy turn a second time  While I thus enjoy the assiduity and benevolence of such a number who are kind enough to interest themselves in my af∣fairs I must own there is a species of Creditors who are an exception to the general rule for though all those of whom I have hitherto been speaking are upon every occasion highly pleased to meet me this last class detest the very sight of me As I am not conscious that I have ever done any thing to in∣cur their displeasure to so great a degree their aversion shocks me the more and notwithstanding all the pains I have taken to soften them by politeness they still remain inexorable Whenever I do not pay them what is due to them I en∣deavour to put them off with the handsomest apology in my power but it is all to no purpose I have run too far in ar∣rears and they are not by any means to be satisfied As I should be glad if you would give them a word of advice I will just hint to you that the perfonages whom I mean are no other than Gentlemen's Servants The cry among them all is "What can a poor servingman do if he is robbed of his  vales by such scoundrels" They are all very unwilling to let me run farther in their debt and therefore it is I can hardly get any thing out of their hands If I call for beer at table they are sure not to hear me till their master orders them to serve the gentleman then I receive the leavings of the tan∣kard just out of the hands of the most capacious swallow in the company In short the peevishness of these my Creditors is a great discount upon my happiness and I must confess there is no kind of pleasure in being in debt to them However I must endeavour to bear this inconvenience and if you will be pleased to insert this letter I shall be proud to get into your books and shall have the farther pleasure of being indebted to you for this act of civility which will always oblige me to be your most obedient servant and sincere wellwisher  ROBERT DUNSCOPE  DIRECTIONS FOR SERVANTS  BY DEAN SWIFT  WHEN your master or lady calls a servant by name if that servant be not in the way none of you are to answer for then there will be no end of your drudgery and masters themselves allow that if a servant comes when he is called it is sufficient  When you have done a fault be always pert and insolent and behave yourself as if you were the injured person this will immediately put your master or lady off their mettle  If you see your master wronged by any of your fellowser∣vants be sure to conceal it for fear of being called a telltale however there is one exception in case of a favourite servant who is justly hated by the whole family who therefore are bound in prudence to lay all the faults they can upon the favourite  The cook the butler the groom the marketman and every other servant who is concerned in the expences of the family should act as if the whole of his master's estate ought to be applied to that servant's particular business For in∣stance if the cook computes his master's estate to be a thou∣sand pounds a year he reasonably concludes that a thousand pounds a year will afford meat enough and therefore he need not be sparing the butler makes the same judgment so may the groom and the coachman and thus every branch of expence will be filled to your master's honour  When you are child before company which with submis∣sion to our masters and ladies is an unmannerly practice it often happens that some stranger will have the goodnature to  drop a word in your excuse in such a case you will have a good title to justify yourself and may righty conclude that whenever he chides you afterwards on other occasions he may be in the wrong in which opinion you will be the better confirmed by stating the case to your fellow servants in your own way who will certainly decide in your favour there∣fore as I have said before whenever you are chidden com∣plain as if you were injured  It often happens that servants sent on messages are apt to stay out somewhat longer than the message requires perhaps two four six or eight hours or some such trifle for the temptation to be sure was great and flesh and blood cannot always resist when you return the master storms the lady scolds strip∣ping cudgelling and turning off is the word But here you ought to be provided with a sett of excuses enough to serve on all occasions for instance your uncle came four∣score miles to town this morning on purpose to see you and goes back by break of day tomorrow a brotherservant that borrowed money of you when he was out of place was run∣ning away to Ireland you were taking leave of an old fel∣lowservant who was shipping for Barbadoes your father sent a cow to you to sell and you could not get a chapman till nine at night you were taking leave of a dear cousin who is to be hanged next Saturday you wrenched your foot against a stone and were forced to stay three hours in a shop before you could stir a step some nastiness was thrown on you out of a garretwindow and you were ashamed to come home before you were cleaned and the smell went off you were pressed for the seaservice and carried before a justice of peace who kept you three hours before he examined you and you got off with much ado a bailiff by mistake seized you for a debtor and kept you the whole evening in a spunginghouse you were told your master had gone to a tavern and came to some mischance and your grief was so great that you enquired for his honour in an hundred taverns between Pall Mall and Temple Bar  Take all tradesmen's parts against your master and when you are sent to buy any thing never offer to cheapen it but generously pay the full demand This is highly to your master's honour and may be some shillings in your pocket and you are to consider if your master hath paid too much he can better afford the loss than a poor tradesman  Never submit to stir a finger in any business but that for which you was particularly hired For example if the groom be drunk or absent and the butler be ordered to shut the stable door the answer is ready "An please your honour I  don't understand horses" If a corner of the hanging wants a single nail to fasten it and the footman be directed to tack it up he may say he doth not understand that sort of work but his honour may send for the upholsterer  Masters and ladies are usually quarrelling with the servants for not shutting the doors after them for neither masters nor ladies consider that those doors must be open before they can be shut and that the labour is double to open and shut the doors therefore the best the shortest and easiest way is to do neither But if you are so often teazed to shut the door that you cannot easily forget it then give the door such a clap as you go out as will shake the whole room and make every thing rattle in it to put your master and lady in mind that you observe their directions  If you find yourself to grow into favour with your master or lady take some opportunity in a very mild way to give them warning and when they ask the reason and seem loth to part with you answer that you would rather live with them than any body else but a poor servant is not to be blamed if he strives to better himself that service is no inheritance that your work is great and your wages very small Upon which if your master hath any generosity he will add five or ten shil∣lings a quarter rather than let you go but if you are baulked and have no mind to go off get some fellowservant to tell your master that he hath prevailed upon you to stay  Whatever good bits you can pilfer in the day save them to junket with your fellowservants at night and take in the butler provided he will give you drink  Write your own name and your sweetheart's with the smoak of a candle on the roof of the kitchen or the servantshall to shew your learning  If you are a young sightly fellow whenever you whisper your mistress at the table run your nose full in her cheek or if your breath be good breathe full in her face this I have known to have had very good consequences in some families  Never come till you have been called three or four times for none but dogs will come at the first whistle and when the master calls "Who's there" no servant is bound to come for Who's There is nobody's name  When you have broken all your earthen drinking vessels below stairs which is usually done in a week the copper∣pot will do as well it can boil milk heat porridge hold smallbeer or in case of necessity serve for a jordan therefore apply it indifferently to all these uses but never wash or scour it for fear of taking off the tin  Although you are allowed knives for the servantshall at meals yet you ought to spare them and make use only of your master's  Let it be a constant rule that no chair stool or table in the servantshall or the kitchen shall have above three legs which hath been the ancient and constant practice in all the families I ever knew and is said to be founded upon two reasons first to shew that servants are ever in a tottering condition secondly it was thought a point of humility that the servants chairs and tables should have at least one leg fewer than those of their masters I grant there hath been an exception to this rule with regard to the cook who by old custom was allowed an easychair to sleep in after dinner and yet I have seldom seen them with above three legs Now this epidemical lameness of servants chairs is by philosophers im∣puted to two causes which are observed to make the greatest revolutions in states and empires I mean love and war A stool a chair or a table is the first weapon taken up in a general romping or skirmish and after a peace the chairs if they be not very strong are apt to suffer in the conduct of an amour the cook being usually fat and heavy and the butler a little in drink  I could never enduce to see maidservants so ungenteel as to walk the streets with their petticoats pinned up it is a foolish excuse to alledge theirpetticoats will be dirty when they have so easy a remedy as to walk three or four times down a clean pair of stairs after they come home  When you stop to tattle with some crony servant in the same street leave your own streetdoor open that you may get in without knocking when you come back otherwise your mistress may know you are gone out and you must be chidden  I do most earnestly exhort you all to unanimity and con∣cord but  istake me not you may quarrel with each other as much as you please only always bear in mind that you have a common enemy which is your master and lady and you have a common cause to defend Believe an old practitioner whoever out of malice to a fellowservant carries a tale to his master shall be ruined by a general confederacy against him  The general place of rendezvous for all the servants both  winter and summer is the kitchen there the grand affairs of the family ought to be consulted whether they concern the stable the dairy the pantry the laundry the cellar the nursery the diningroom or my lady's chamber there as in your own proper element you can laugh and squall and romp in full security  When any servant comes home drunk and cannot appear you must all join in telling your master that he is gone to bed sick upon which your lady will be so goodnatured as to order some comfortable thing for the poor man or maid  When your master or lady go abroad together to dinner or on a visit for the evening you need leave only one servant in the house unless you have a blackguard boy to answer at the door and attend the children if there be any Who is to stay at home is to be determined by short and long cuts and the stayer at home may be comforted by a visit from a sweet∣heart without danger of being caught together These op∣portunities must never be missed because they come but some∣times and all is safe enough while there is a servant in the house  When your master or lady comes home and wants a ser∣vant who happens to be abroad your answer must be that he had but just that minute stept out being sent for by a cousin who was dying  If your master calls you by name and you happen to answer at the fourth call you need not hurry yourself and if you be chidden for staying you may lawfully say you came no sooner because you did not know what you were called for  When you are chidden for a fault as you go out of the room and down stairs mutter loud enough to be plainly heard this will make him believe you are innocent  Whoever comes to visit your master or lady when they are abroad never burden your memory with the person's name for indeed you have too many other things to remember be∣sides it is a porter's business and your master's fault he does not keep one and who can remember names and you will certainly mistake them and you can neither write nor read  If it be possible never tell a lye to your master or lady un∣less you have some hopes that they cannot find it out in less than half an hour When a servant is turned off  ll his faults must be told although most of them were never  own by his master or lady and all mischiefs done by others charge to him Instance them And when they ask any of you why you never acquainted them before the answer is "Sir" or "Madam really I was afraid it would make you angry and besides perhaps you might think it was malice in me" Where there are little masters and misses in a house they are usually great impediments to the diversions of the servants the only remedy is to bride them with Goody Goodies that they may not tell tales to papa and mamma  I advise you of the servant  whose masters live in the country and who expect vales always to stand rank and file  when a stranger is taking his leave so that he must of ne∣cessity pass between you and he must have more confidence or less money than usual if any of you let him escape and ac∣cording as he behaves himself remember to treat him the next time he comes  If you are sent with readymoney to buy any thing at a shop and happen at that time to be out of pocket sink the money and take up the goods on your master's account This is for the honour of your master and yourself for he becomes a man of credit at your recommendation  When your lady sends for you up to her chamber to give you any orders be sure to stand at the door and keep it open fiddling with the lock all the while she is talking to you and keep the button in your hand for fear you should forget to shut the door after you  If your master or lady happen once in their lives to accuse you wrongfully you are a happy servant for you have no∣thing more to do than for every fault you commit while you are in their service to put them in mind of that false accusation and protest yourself equally innocent in the present case  When you have a mind to leave your master and are too bashful to break the matter for fear of offending him the best way is to grow rude and saucy of a sudden and beyond your usual behaviour till he finds it necessary to turn you off and when you are gone to revenge yourself give him and his lady such a character to all your brother servants who are out of place that none will venture to offer their service  Some nice ladies who are afraid of catching cold having observed that the maids and fellows belowstairs often forget to shut the door after them as they come in or go out into the backyards have contrived that a pulley and a rope with a large piece of lead at the end should be so fixed as to make the door shut of itself and require a strong hand to open it which is an immense toil to servants whose business may force them to go in and out fifty times in a morning but ingenuity can do much for prudent servants have found out an effectual remedy against this insupportable grievance by tying up the pulley in such a manner that the weight of lead shall have no effect however as to my own part I would rather chuse to keep the door always open by laying a heavy stone at the bot∣tom of it  The servants candlesticks are generally broken for nothing can last for ever But you may find out many expedients you may conveniently stick your candle in a bottle or with a lump of butter against the wainscot in a powderhorn or in an old shoe or in a cleftstick or in the barrel of a pistol  or upon it's own grease on a table in a coffeecup or a drink∣ing glass a horncann a teapot a twisted napkin a mustardpot an inkhorn a marrowbone a piece of dough or you may cut a hole in the loaf and stick it there  When you invi  e the neighbouring servants to junket with you at home in an evening teach them a peculiar way of tap∣ping or scraping at the kitchenwindow which you may hear but not your master or lady whom you must take care not to disturb or frighten at such unseasonable hours  Lay all faults upon a lapdog or favourite cat a monkey a parrot a child or on the servant who was last turned off by this rule you will excuse yourself do no hurt to any body else and save your master or lady from the trouble and vexation of chiding  When you want proper instruments for any work you are about use all expedients you can invent rather than leave your work undone For instance if the poker be out of the way or broken stir the fire with the tongs if the tongs be not at hand use the muzzle of the bellows the wrong end of the fireshovel the handle of the firebrush the end of a mop or your master's cane If you want paper to singe a fowl tear the first book you see about the house Wipe your shoes for want of a clout with the bottom of a curtain or a damask napkin Strip your liverylace for garters If the butler wants a jordan he may use the great silver cup  There are several ways of putting out candles and you ought to be instructed in them all you may run the candleend against the wainscot which puts the snuff out immediate∣ly you may lay it on the ground and tread the snuff out with your foot you may hold it upsidedown until it is choaked with it's own grease or cram it into the socket of the candlestick you may whirl it round in your hand till it goes out when you go to bed after you have made water you may dip the candleend into the chamberpot you may spit on your finger and thumb and pinch the snuff till it goes out The cook may run the candle's nose into the mealtub or the groom into a vessel of oats or a lock of hay or a heap of litter the housemaid may put out her candle by running it against a lookingglass which nothing cleans so well as candlesnuff but the quickest and best of all methods is to blow it out with your breath which leaves the candle clear and readier to be lighted  There is nothing so pernicious in a family as a telltale against whom it must be the principal business of you all to unite whatever office he serves in take all opportunities to spoil the business he is about and to cross him in every thing  For instance if the butler be a telltale break his glasses when∣ever he leaves the pantrydoor open or lock the cat or the mastiff in it who will do as well or mislay a fork or a spoon so as he may never find it If it be the cook whenever she turns her back throw a lump of soot or a handful of salt in the pot or smoaking coals into the drippingpan or daub the roastmeat with the back of the chimney or hide the key of the jack If a footman be suspected let the cook daub the back of his new livery or when he is going up with a dish of soup let her follow him softly with a ladlefull and dribble it all the way up stairs to the diningroom and then let the housemaid make such a noise that her lady may hear it The waitingmaid is very likely to be guilty of this fault in hopes to ingratiate herself in this case the laundress must be sure to tear her smocks in the washing and yet wash them but half and when she complains tell all the house that she sweats so much and her flesh is so nasty that she souls a smock more in one hour than the kitchenmaid doth in a week  SPEECH OF LAWYER BRIEF  MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY  THERE are a set of men in the world of such a tedious tiresome trifling troublesome habitude temper and disposition of mind that they perplex confound entangle and puzzle every circumstance in every cause which they under∣take protect defend and justify Instead of coming to the point matter business or debate they deviate vary waver and fly off therefrom When we expect truth satisfaction conviction and decision we find perceive observe and re∣mark nothing but uncertainty ambiguity doubtfulness and difficulty This my lord I humbly apprehend conceive think presume and furmise is owing to tediousness and pro∣lixity the nature genius and extent of which I shall con∣sider weigh examine explicate and scrutinize In the first place then I shall shew prove and demonstrate the nature of tediousness and prolixity by shewing proving and demon∣strating that there is nothing so unnatural for the business of a tongue utterance speech or language is to come to the point argument contemplation or question at once pointblank slapdash and concisely without any prevarication equi∣vocation retardation or circumbendibus whatsoever And now in the second succeeding following place point and preliminary I come to promulgate the genius of tediousness and prolixity which is done effected performed and brought about by manisesting that they have no genius at all and so  far from any men of genius making use of them none but your egregious absurd ridiculous dolts dunderheads and block∣heads ever admit acknowledge receive or embrace any such notions ideas maxims principles or tenets Thirdly my lord I beg leave according to order form series and suc∣cession to animadvert upon the extent of tediousness and pro∣lixity and this is managed by demonstrating that it is infinite and without bounds and consequently can have no extent at all And now my lord I will open the cause spring origin fountain rise and foundation of these vices which is Tauto∣logy which is the speaking saying delivering uttering pro∣nouncing divulging declaring remarking observing repeat∣ing or expressing the same identical individual thing an hun∣dred and an hundred and an hundred and an hundred and an hundred hundred hundred times over And now my lord I beg leave pardon permission and sufferance to lay down only six and fifty particulars every particular my lord shall consist of only seventytwo divisions every division shall comprehend contain and consist of only eightytwo subdivisions every subdivision shall be concluded with the six and fortieth article and every article shall consume expend and cost no more than an hour and an half  Here the court was out of all manner of patience and the judge with great indignation put a period to a discourse which if the lawyer's tongue had heen immortal might have lasted to all eternity  TRUTH AT COURT A FRENCH STORY  BY MR HARRISON  IN France where Kings though now despis'd  Were long 'twas thought too highly priz'd  Louis XIVlike Charles the Gay  Our harebrain who the nation curs'd  For basely killing Charles the First  Would with his courtiers idly play  Whether he play'd them fair or foul  I cannot tell you on my soul  But surely 'twas a thing most rare  If they at all times play'd him fair  Nor would it seem less strange to me  When I espy  The bets run high  For gamblers ever to agree  And griev'd I own my fears that then  Kings are no more than common men  Gaming the deadly source of woe  To those who love it high or low  A medley makes of great and small  Like Death and Democrats it levels all  It chanc'd one day  While thus at play  A move at chess the King had made  Which much he swore was just the thing  The courtiers though to swear afraid  Bending with noses to the ground  And venting first a sigh profound  Begg'd leave to differ from the King  Louis true gamester will persist  And they true courtiers wont resist  For now his stubbornness they found  Each mother's son soon chang'd his ground  And that their sovereign must be right  Were almost certainbut not quite  While thus the matter doubtful stood  Grammont a courtier wise and good  Such as have now and then been known  Not often to attend the throne  Ent'ring the room the monarch spies  And loudly thus exulting cries  "Grammont come here you shall decide  By your opinion we'll abide  The move I've made gives me the game  And you I know will say the same  Though dubious all around appear  Justice from you has nought to fear  Approach and see""There is no need"  Blunt Grammont cries "for I've decreed  Your Majesty has lost the game"  "Morblieu you have not look'dfor shame  Unseen to judge Is that the thing"  "Yes when one party is a King  Had you the shadow of a right  Doubtless these gentlemen polite  Would ev'ry man before I came  Have own'd the justness of your claim  But when they know their monarch wrong  Tho' doubts may venture from the tongue  Courtiers and courts too well I know  To hope they'll ever tell him so"  Tho' Kings but ill bear contradiction  Truth flash'd and Louis felt conviction  And all the court who now withdrew  By shrugs confess'd the thing was true  THE PILGRIMS AND THE PEAS A TRUE STORY  BY PETER PINDAR ESQ  A Brace of sinners for no  good  Were order'd to the Virgin Mary's shrine  Who at Loretto dwelt in wax stone wood  And in a fair white wig look'd wond'rous fine  Fifty long miles had these sad rogues to travel  With something in their shoes much worse than  gravel  In short their toes so gentle to  amuse  The PRIEST had order'd Peas into their shoes  A  nostrum  famous in old Popish times  For purifying souls that stunk of crimes  A sort of apostolick salt  That Popish parsons for it's pow'rs exalt  For keeping souls of sinners  sweet  Just as our kitchen salt keeps  meat  The knaves set off on the same day  Peas in their shoes to go and pray  But very different was their speed I wot  One of the sinners gallop'd on  Light as a bullet from a gun  The other limp'd as if he had been  shot  ONE saw the VIRGIN soon  peccavi  cried  Had his soul whitewash'd all so clever  Then home again he nimbly hied  Made fit with saints above to live  for ever  In coming back however let me say  He met his brother rogue about halt way  Hobbling with outstretch'd bum and bending knees  Damning the souls and bodies of the Peas  His eyes in tears his cheeks and brows in sweat  Deep sympathizing with his groaning feet  "How now" the lighttoed whitewash'd Pilgrim broke  "You lazy lubber"  "Ods curse it" cried the other "'tis no  joke    My feet once hard as any rock  Are now as soft as  blubber  "Excuse me Virgin Mary that I swear  As for Loretto I shall ne'er get there  No to the Dev'l my sinful soul must go  For damme if I ha'n't lost ev'ry toe  "But brother sinner do explain  How 'tis that you are not in pain  What Pow'r hath work'd a wonder for  your  toes  While  I  just like a snail am crawling  Now swearing now on saints devoutly bawling  While not a rascal comes to ease my woes  "How is't that  you  can like a greyhound  go  Merry as if that nought had happen'd burn ye"  "Why" cried the other grinning "you must  know  That just before I ventur'd on my journey  To walk a little more at ease  I took the liberty to boil  my  Peas"  THE FASHIONABLE PAIR

INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE PERFORMING THE DUTY OF A CHRISTIAN  THOUGH this print may seem to a cursory observer less striking and important than any of the whole series it is in fact of the very first consequence It is by attending the publick worship of the Supreme Being with becoming piety that virtue is strengthened and it is by the neglect of this duty that vice gains ground of it's victim From this scene Tom Idle is excluded With him it was no favourite place for during the hours of devotion it will in the next print be seen that he was far differently employed  The industrious youth Francis Goodchild is in this print represented at Spitalfields church assisting in the performance of divine worship and he is honoured with the company of Miss West his master's daughter in the same pew to whom his features bear a not very distant resemblance They have both a sweet placidity of countenance Piety and simplicity are manifest in their deportment and they seem at first sight evidently made for each other  Notwithstanding the solemnity of the place Hogarth has contrived to give us some ludicrous figures without any vio∣lent departure from nature The fat grotesque female in the upper corner the man near her accompanying the organ with his deeptoned vocal exertions and him beneath "be∣tween sleeping and waking" who joins in the sonorous chorus  are all though ludicrous such characters as every spectator must recognize The pewopener with her keys is also hap∣pily sketched aiding the solemn vociferations  The rules of perspective are in this print purposely violated to give an idea of a crouded congregation but the figures in general are so minute that their merits are imperceptible Where they are visible character is to be traced in each  On a slight examination of this print we felt a little in∣clined to censure Hogarth for neglecting to present us with the worthy Mr West attending divine worship with his family and thus strengthening the moral effect But we soon dis∣covered that this far from being an error was a merit beyond vulgar view since the absence of the master the better ac∣counts for that of his vicious apprentice  The motto of this print is from the Royal Psalmist  "O how I love they law it is my meditation all the day"  Psalm cxix  THE TAYLOR'S SOLILOQUY  BY MR HARRISON  TO be or not to bea Taylor That is the question Shall I who feel myself a man yes every inch a man have but oneninth of my just claim allowed as if it were my bill taxed by too rigid Justice who being blind sees not the risque I run Forbid it Heaven I am a man and a man of consequence too for no man is a man without me Even kings would be Sans Culottes if I turned traitor and refused to make them breeches and who would reverence their bench of judges and their bench of bishops if I did not manusac∣ture furred gowns and lawn sleeves Yes law divinity and physick too all stand indebted to me for their impor∣tance I am therefore not only a man but a man of im∣portance What would our sailors do those brave fellows to whom we chiefly owe the safety of our country itself with∣out jackets and trowsers why they would be as barebottomed as so many Mounseers and then we should see that they had no more bottom neither The soldiers too they would cut a very pretty figure to be sure without me Why zounds it's enough to make a man swear but as I am a mandamme I must be a man for no animal on earth but a man ever swearsyes surely as I am a man the very rea∣son that the girls all run to the parade to the parks to every review to the camps and to all places after the soldiers where soldiers are to be seen is because they are so smartly cloathed by me What makes soldiers in their eyes look  so handsome but the scarlet cloth the buff and the blue in which I dress them the gold lace and the worsted lace the gold epaulets and the worsted epaulets with which I trim the most valiant dogs in the world A taylor then is not only a man but a man of valour since he trims them all At court who would be introduced into the royal presence without my preparing them for a good reception Does it signify one far∣thing what is within provided as how I have the management of the outside In courting too as well as at court are not ninetynine women out of every hundred more governed in their choice by my part of the object than any other consider∣ation whatever "A good  coat  " as the old song  should  say "and a light pair of breeches go through the world" If a man has no credit with his taylor he has none elsewhere nobody will admit a man of merit out at elbows into his house no∣body will speak to genius cloathed with rags in the street But let me have the dressing of the vile  t rascal in the universe and see if he is not welcomed like a prince in every fashionable circle Is it not dress that makes him a gentleman Is it not me that regulates the fashions I therefore must be a gentleman as well as a man of fashion Can any man who is not well cloathed by me cloath the best story in the world so as to be reckoned wit in polite company And will not the most threadbare joke uttered by one whom I have thus qualified convulse the very same circle with laughter I am therefore the maker of wit and must of course be a man of wit Shall I then who can do all these great things be cast off and despised like an old garment the instant I quit my shopboard Shall I who am not only a man but a man of consequence not only a man of consequence but a man of importance not only a man of importance but a man of va∣lour not only a man of valour but a gentleman not only a gentleman but a man of wit be bawled after by every shabby ragged rascal whenever I fetch a walk with Mrs Snip my daughter Dolly or some favourite girl"Look there goes Snip the taylor the ninth part of a man" and when I mount my nag just to take an airing in the dust of Hyde Park like my customers see every one turning singerpost and hear them cry "Twig the taylor riding to Brentford" while a wag slily contrives to make a slip of paper resembling a measure dangle from my pocket Shall I who know so well how to live and how to live well too be thus made weary of my life or even of my livelihood by a set of ragamussios Poets and philosophers prate that a bare bodkin will  quiet us  a bare breech I was going to say It might quiet us but would it quiet the devil He I am told will not be cheated out of his own like a poor taylor by his bad customers and I should  chuse since I am obliged to give long credit to have as long allowed me as possible They may talk of shuffling off life but I had rather shuffle through life Conscience they say makes cowards of us all but a taylor has no conscience ergo a taylor is no coward Shall I who am a man of so many functions submit to be thus treated without reply No if they could cut me as small as cabbage put me in the fire like my goose freeze me into the coldness of my favourite cu∣cumbers or send me to hell itself I will speakwhile I am a man The world shall hear of my illusage and if I do not experience more respect each mother's son shall be reduced to the primitive figleaf apronor I will make them all pay swingeingly for every article of dress they get from me and thus in my turnlaugh in my sleeve Damme who's afraid  HUMOROUS ESSAY ON ERRORS OF THE PRESS  ORIGINALLY SENT TO A MORNING PAPER  BY CALEB WHITEFOORD ESQ  MR EDITOR  WHILE you and your correspondents are so laudably employed in watching over the welfare of the state keeping a jealous eye on our ministers and pointing out the  errors  of government I wish if you could but find time for it that you would pay some little attention to your own  errors  Perhaps it will appear the highest degree of presumption to offer advice to a person in  your  eminent station  one  who every day Sundays excepted dictates to ministers and counsels kings  one  who is read and admired in every part of the British dominions  It is for this very reason Sir that I think it incumbent on me to tell you of your  mistakes  for you cannot say with  Job  Albeit that I have erred mine  ERROR  remaineth with  MY∣SELF  No Mr Editor  your  errors circulate far and wide they misrepresent many and mislead more in short the errors I mean are  errors of the press  or as my  learned  friend  Sir James Hodges  expresses them in  one  EnglishLatinsingularplural word  erratums  Of all errata the most  harmless  are those which make stark∣staring  nonsense  These are never imputed to the writer but are corrected by the reader in his own mind as he goes along but the  dangerous  ones are those which make a kind of halfsense and pass current as the sense of the  author  until the  day following when your list of errata transfers the blame from the writer to the printer However I must say that printers with all their professions of candour are as little apt to acknowledge  their  errors as the rest of mankind for not one erratum in ten is ever acknowledged and indeed I sup∣pose they very seldom would unless at the particular desire of the writer  As I have said much about the  errors of the press  it may naturally be expected that I should produce some proofs of what I have asserted This I am enabled to do having paid particular attention to them for some time past and having looked more sharply after them than the promotions civil or military the prices of corn or of stocks the list of ships or bankrupts or of those paragraphs which inform who is dead who is married or who is hanged  But now for the particulars of the chargeI have known you throw an injurious reflection on all the crowned heads in Europe at one stroke for instead of  potentates  you have called them  potatoes  as if they had been  mere vegetables  As to the King of Prussia you talk of  him  in a different stile for in∣stead of the  Hero  of Prussia you have made him the  Nero  Next day comes your apology or  erratum  which sometimes instead of mending matters makes things worse and like an archtinker in stopping one hole makes two as I remember my old friend Alderman Faulkner of Dublin corrected an error in  his  Journal "Erratum in our last for  his  Grace the  Dutchess  of Dorset read  her  Grace the  Duke  of Dorset" Indeed a blunder seems to be something of the nature of a  bog  the more you struggle the deeper you get into it But to proceed You have on several occasions used the  Doge  of Genoa extremely ill and never have made him the least apo∣logy for omitting the last letter in his title though if you  had  desired your readers next day instead of  Dog  to read  Doge  I do confess that it would have been no great reparation  I remember the Irish parliament some time ago were of∣fended at something in your paper and took up the matter so  warmly  that they ordered the paper to be burnt Now whe∣ther  you  Mr Editor have taken umbrage also and like  wise  or whether it proceeds from negligence I know not but cer∣tain it is that several unlucky mistakes have happened relative to that respectable body At their first meeting you told us instead of a  bili  that a motion would be made for leave to bringin a  bull  and afterwards another motion that the or∣der of the  Dey  be read as if it was an assembly on the coast of  Barbary  You told us one day that  Lord  of the kingdom of Ireland had been safely delivered of a daughter  and we were all very anxious on my lord's account till the day following when you delivered his lordship of the burden and brought the child into the world a more natural way  In a late scuffle under the Piazza Covent Garden you in∣formed us that an Irish officer had got a  confusion  in his head and you made no apology afterwards thinking I suppose there was no occasion for any as you were right to a  t  Not long ago you advertised a speedy cure for  raptures  and I am afraid it gave some wicked batchelor occasion to scoff at the holy state of matrimony for as the devil would have it I mean one of  your  devils the very next advertisement to it was from a gentleman who wanted a wife and over it was printed MATRIMONY in capitals consequently it appeared that  matrimony  was the most speedy and effectual cure for  raptures  though of ever so long standing c c  I have known you advertise instead of a  never  failing re∣medy an  ever  failing remedy now Sir though this might be strictly true "yet I hold it not proper that it should be so set down" as I suppose the quackdoctor paid you his money for conveying a very different sense to the publick In a receipt lately published for the cure of the plague instead of  rue  you put  rice  and so made a  pudding  of it and in adver∣tising a course of lectures you turned a  syllabus  into a  syllabub  and called the perpetual  motion  a perpetual  notion  I wish you would be a little more cautious in advertising  Salivation not necessary  for it happened by omitting the  i  in salivation you gave great offence to some very good christians in my neigbourhood and also gave occasion to some wicked  punsters  to observe that it was not the  first  time an  eye  had been lost in salivation nay that some people had been so un∣lucky as to lose a  couple  There is another advertisement which frequently occurs beginning with  "Whereas several evilminded persons c"  One day you made it evilminded  parsons  which was ex∣tremely unlucky for in these times of  infidelity  people are too apt to scoff at the clergy and indeed at all serious subjects as to myself I must confess that I am particularly hurt at those  impertinent levities  with which some people indulge themselves being a person of a serious turn of mind and of a disposition rather saturnine and grave  It too often happens Mr Editor that "what should be  grave  you turn to  farce  " I remember in your paper a sen∣sible pathetick letter signed a  Citizen  he laments the  internal  state of this country and  you  made it the  infernal  state when he exclaimed sad  reverse  you made him cry our sad  reverie  he disapproved of all  national  reflections you made him disap∣prove  of all  rational  reflections and talking of the  fate  of empires you made him say the  fat  of empires Now as there are so many standing jokes about citizens being fond of  fat  whether turtle fat or venison fatthis unlucky mistake quite spoiled the letter disobliged my friend the  Citizen  and "all the fat was in the fire" And here I cannot help taking notice of a paragraph some time since containing an account of the election of a a worthy alderman for a certain ward when in∣stead of saying he was  duly  elected you say he was  dully  elected and thereby afforded a handle for breaking some common∣place jests on that respectable body of men the Court of Alder∣men Another time in the account of an entertainment given by a worthy alderman to the deputy and commoncoun∣cil of his ward where they  dined  on the turtle you said they  died  on the turtle as if they had all eat till they choaked or burst whereas on the contrary it was extremely remarkable that none either overeat themselves or caught a surfeit that day  From several articles Mr Editor one would be apt to con∣clude that you were no great  geographer  for you tell us of corsairs fitted out from  Turin  instead of  Tunis  and that the  Chinese  had revolted against the Spaniards instead of the  Chi∣lese  now though these two nations are on different sides of the globe I suppose you thought they were near neighbours being within an  ell  of each other Last year when the Rus∣sian fleet took the Isle of  Lemnos  you told us that part of the squadron remained at the Isle of  Candy  and the rest were going to attack the Isle of  Lemons  you supposed no doubt that  Candy  was a sugar island and that they were going to the Isle of  Lemons  for fruit and so between them to supply the fleet pro bono publicowith  punch  You have sometimes treated the  Russians  very injuriously by calling them  Russians  and one day you told us the com∣bined armies of the Turks and Tartars instead of a  Kam  was commanded by a  Ram  as if they had been a parcel of sheep and when it was expected the two armies were coming to  Action  you said they were coming to  Acton  and as there was a considerable fall of Stocks at that time I have reason to think it was owing to the above report or to some other equally alarming  I trembled for you during the whole time of the congress at  Fockzany  it is a ticklish word in the hands of a careless com∣positor and one does not know what terrible work he might make of it Apropos it is not long since you advertised a view of the canal of  Venice  and you made it the canal of  Ve∣nus  and in the account of a housebreaking instead of the  rogues broke in at the  window  you said they broke in at the  widow  When you informed us that a certain lady was gone to pass the holiday at her countryseat near  Corydon  every reader supposed that some  scandal  was meant till the next day when we learned that there was no Corydon in the case and that her ladyship was only gone to her countryseat hear  Croydon  One day you told us that some English lord whose name I have forgot was arrived at Naples with his  tabor  travelling with a  tabor  seemed to be an odd kind of conceit but his lord∣ship  apparement  was soud of musick though the tabor and pipe seemed more adapted to a  lugged bear  than a lord on his travels thus  we  reasoned till the  erratum  of the next day de∣sired us for  tabor  to read  tütor  If your compositors are bad geographers they are at least as bad  arithmeticians  wherever sums occur they are sure to make a bad  figure  I remember at difierent times last year they made the  compulsatory  India loan and sometimes in short they have no adequate ideas of figures and as to  cyphers  they consider them as  mere no∣things  and that adding or taking away two or three of them from a sum makes no difference at all  I have known you turn a matter of  bearsay  into a matter of  heresy Damon  into a  Daemon  a  delicious  girl into a  deli∣rious  girl the comick  muse  into a comick  mouse  a Jewish  Rabbi  into a Jewish  Rabbit  and when a correspondent la∣menting the corruption of the times exclaimed  "O Mores"  you made him cry  "O Moses"  You should consider Mr Editor that there is a material difference between acting with the utmost  lenity  and utmost  Levity  between  factious  and  facetious fellow  and  felon im∣prudent  and  impudent resolution  and  revolution Runney mead  and  running mad loud professions  and  lewd professions words  and  works souring  and  roaring Thavies Inn  and  Thieves Inn minutes  and  minuets rubies  and  bubbies  a  tube  and a  tub  all of which words I have observed you Sir at times use  indiscriminately  I know you will say that people ought to consider the constant hurry which attends the publication of a daily paper that your paper is in so  great  request and people are so eager to get it  "with all it's imperfections on it's head"  that you really have not time to be more correct Ah Mr Editor it would be well for mankind if reformation like charity were always to begin at  home  and that people would try to mend  themselves  instead of bestowing so much fruitless and thankless pains in admonishing their neighbours You Sir have be∣stowed  much time and labour and oil floods of ink and reams of paper in advising ministers of state and correcting the measures of government and after all I dare say  you yourself  will allow that they are at this moment not one bit better or wiser than when you first undertook to mend them  Therefore take an old man's advice set a pattern to thy brother editors leave for a while the care of the state to those who are  paid  for itlook at home begin a reformation  there  and  "correct thyself for the example of others"  I am  Thy sincere wellwisher EMENDATOR  CONJUGAL AFFECTION FROM THE GERMAN  THE tenderhearted Araminta loved her husband sin∣cerely for they had been but two months married He constituted her sole felicity Their desires and aversions were the same It was Araminta's study by diligent atten∣tion to anticipate her husband's wishes "Such a wife" says my male reader who entertains thoughts of matrimony "such a wife would I desire" And such a wife mayest thou enjoy Araminta's husband sell sick of a very dange∣rous malady "No hope" said the physician and shook his awful wig Bitterly wept Araminta"O Death might I prefer a petition Spare O spare my husband and let me be the victim in his stead" Death to her astonish∣ment straight appeared "And what" cried the grim ty∣rant "is thy request""There" said Araminta trem∣bling with fear and amazement "there he lies pierced with intolerable agony he implores thy speedy relief for Hea∣ven's sake put him instantly out of his misery"  CURIOUS CRITIQUE ON ROUSSEAU WITH A PROPHECY FOUND IN AN OLD MANUSCRIPT  IT has been remarked that a bad book ought as much to be guarded against as a bad companion There certainly is nothing more true and yet the most dangerous are daily pub∣lished uncensured and a mean ignorant and mercenary or unprincipled publisher may spead poison daily more detri∣mental than arsenick Some books like men acquire great reputation by some brilliant points while the general tendency like the general character is never investigated  In no instance is this more remarkable than in the writings of the celebrated Rousseau The annals of literature never ex∣hibited to the world a more paradoxical whimsical ingenious eloquent weak and dangerous author  This author's works have been much read whise few have examined the truth of his pictures or analized the consistency or tendency of his doctrines In the preface to his novel he says"Chaste girls never read romances and the girl who reads four pages of this is undone"  Yet no books are more called for at Circulating Libraries than romances and none more than his With such senti∣ments he gives his book to the world and then presumes to write on education  The following fragment which I lately met with said to be sound among some old manuscripts it is believed will convey in a strong and true light what is said of his writings and may perhaps lead some people to think when they read  THE PROPHECY  IN those days a strange person shall appear in France coming from the borders of a lake and he shall cry to the peo∣ple"Behold I am possessed by the demon of enthusiasm I have received the gift of incoherence I am a philosopher and a professor of paradoxes"  And a multitude shall follow him and many shall believe on him  And he shall say to them "You are all knaves and fools and your wives and daughters are debauched and I will come and live among you" And he shall abuse the natural gentle∣ness of the people by his foul speeches  And he shall cry aloud "All men are virtuous in the coun∣try where I was born but I will not live in the country where I was born"  And he shall maintain that arts and sciences necessarily cor∣rupt the manners and he shall write on all arts and sciences  And he shall declare the theatre a source of prostitution and corruption and he shall write operas and comedies  And he shall affirm savages only are virtuous though he has never lived among savages but he shall be worthy to live among them  And he shall say to men "Cast away your fine garments and go naked" and he himself shall wear laced cloaths when they are given him  And he shall say to the great they are more despicable than their fortunes but he shall frequent their houses and they  shall behold him as a curious animal brought from a strange land  And his occupation shall be to copy French musick and he shall say there is no French musick  And he shall declare romances destructive to morality and he shall write a romance and in his romance the words shall be virtuous and the morals wicked and his characters shall be outrageous lovers and philosophers  And he shall say to the universe "I am a favourite of for∣tune I write and receive loveletters" and the universe shall s  the letters he received were written by himself  And in his romance he shall reach the art of suborning a maiden by philosophy and she shall learn from her lover to forget shame and become ridiculous and write maxims  And she shall give her lover the first kiss upon his lips and shall invite him to lie with her and he shall lie with her and she shall become big with metaphysicks and her billetdoux shall be homilies of philosophy  And he shall teach her that parents have no authority in the choice of a husband and he shall paint them barbarous and un∣natural  And he shall refuse wages from the father because of the de∣licacy natural to men and receive money underhand from the daughter which he shall prove to be exceedingly proper  And he shall get drank with an English Lord who shall in∣sult him and he shall propose to fight with the English Lord and his mistress who  a  lost the honour of her own sex shall decide upon that of men and she shall teach him who taught her every thing that he ought not to fight  And he shall receive a persion from the Lord and shall go to Paris where he shall not frequent the society of wellbred and sensible people but of flirts and petitmaities and he shall believe he has seen Paris  And he shall write to his mistress that the women are grena∣diers go naked and refuse nothing to any man they chance to meet  And when the same women shall receive him at their coun∣tryhouses and amuse themselves with his vanity he shall say they are prodigies of reason and virtue  And the  petitmaitres  shall bring him to a brothel and he shall get drunk like a fool and lie with strange women and write an account of all this to his mistress and she shall thank him  And he shall receive his mistress's picture and his imagi∣nation shall kindle at the sight and his mistress shall give him obscene  ssons on solitary chastity  And this mistress shall marry the first man that arrives from the world's end and notwithstanding all her craft she shall imagine no means to break off the match and she shall pass intrepidly from her lover's to her husband's arms  And her husband shall know before his marriage that she is desperately in love with and beloved by another man and he shall voluntarily make them miserable but he shall be a good man and moreover an atheist  And his wife shall immediately find herself exceedingly happy and shall write to her lover that were she still free she would prefer her husband to him  And the philosophick lover shall resolve to kill himself  And he shall write a long dissertation to prove that a man ought to kill himself when he has lost his mistress and his friend shall prove the thing not worth the trouble and the philosopher shall not kill himself  And he shall make the tour of the globe to give his mis∣tress's children time to grow that he may return to be their preceptor and teach them virtue as he taught their mother  And the philosopher shall see nothing in his tour round the globe  And he shall return to Europe  And the husband of his mistress though acquainted with their whole intrigue shall bring his good friend to his house  And the virtuous wife shall leap upon his neek at his en∣trance and the husband shall be charmed and they shall all three embrace every day and the husband shall be jocose upon their adventures and shall believe they are become reasonable and they shall continue to love with extasy and shall delight to remember their voluptuousness and they shall walk hand in hand and weep  And the philosopher being in a boat with his mistress alone shall be inclined to throw her overboard and jump after her  And they shall call all this virtue and philosophy  And while they talk of virtue and philosophy no one shall be able to comprehend what is either virtue or philosophy  And they shall prove virtue no longer to consist in the fear of temptation but in the pleasure of being continually exposed to it and philosophy shall be the art of making vice amiable  And the philosopher's mistress shall have a few trees and a stream in her garden and she shall call her gardens Elysium and no one shall be able to comprehend her  And she shall feed the wanton sparrows in her Elysium and she shall watch her domestick male and female lest they should be as amorous as herself  And she shall sup with her daylabourers and hold them in great respect and shall beat hemp with her philosopher at her side  And her philosopher will determine to beat hemp the next day the day after and every day of his life  And the labourers shall sing and the philosopher shall be en∣chanted by their melodies although not Italian  And she shall educate her children with great care and shall not let them speak before strangers nor hear the name of God  And she shall gormandize but she shall eat beans and pease seldom and only in the temple of Apollo and this shall be phi∣losophick forbearance  And she shall write to her good friend that she continues as she began that is to love him passionately  And the husband shall send the letter to the lover  And they shall not know what is become of the lover  And they shall not care what is become of the lover  And the whole romance shall be useful good and moral for it shall prove that daughters have a right to dispose of their hearts hands and favours without consulting parents or regarding the inequality of conditions  And it shall shew that while you talk of virtue it is useless to practise it  And that it is the duty of a young girl to go to bed to one man and marry another  And that it is sufficient for those who deliver themselves up to vice to feel a temporary remorse for virtue  And that a husband ought to open his doors and his arms to his wife's lover  And that the wife ought to have him for ever in her arms and take in good part the husband's jokes and the lover's whims  And she ought to prove or believe she has proved that love between married people is useless and impertinent  And this book shall be written in an emphatick stile which shall impose upon simple people  And the author shall abound in words and shall suppose he abounds in arguments  And he shall heap one exaggeration upon another and he shall have no exceptions  And he shall wish to be forcible and he shall be extra∣vagant and he shall always industriously draw general con∣clusions from particular c  ses  And he shall neither know simplicity truth or nature and he shall apply all his force to explain the easiest and most trifi  ng things and sarcasm shall be thought reason and his talents  shall caricature virtue and overthrow good sense and he shall gaze upon the phantoms of his brain and his eyes shall never see reality  And like empiricks who make wounds to shew the power of their specificks he shall poison souls that he may have the glory of curing them and the poison shall act violently on the mind and on the heart but the antidote shall act on the mind only and the poison shall prevail  And he shall vaunt that he has dug a pit and think himself free from reproach by saying "Woe be to the young girls that fall into my pit I have warned them of it in my preface" And young girls never read prefaces  And when in his romance he shall have mutually degraded philosophy by manners and manners by philosophy he shall say a corrupt people must have romances  And he shall also say a corrupt people must have rogues  And he shall leave the world to draw the conclusion  And he shall add to justify himself for having written a book where vice predominates that he lived in an age when it was impossible to be good  And to excuse himself he shall calumniate all mankind  And he shall threaten to despise all those who do not believe in his book  And virtuous people shall consider his folly with an eye of pity  And he shall no longer be called a philosopher but the most eloquent of all the sophists  And they shall wonder how a pure mind could conceive such an impure book  And those who believed in him shall believe in him no more  HUMOROUS ANECDOTE OF HOGARTH AND A NOBLEMAN  IN the early part of Hogarth's life a nobleman who was uncommonly ugly and deformed came to fit to him for his picture It was executed with a skill that did honour to the artist's abilities but the likeness was rigidly observed without even the necessary attention to compliment or flattery The peer disgusted at this counterpart of his dear self never once thought of paying for a reflector that would only insult him with his deformities Some time was suffered to elapse before the artist applied for his money but afterwards many applications were made by him who had then no need of a banker for payment without success The painter how∣ever  at last hit upon an expedient which he knew must alarm the nobleman's pride and by that means answer his purpose It was couched in the following card  "Mr HOGARTH's dutiful respects to Lord finding that he does not mean to have the picture which was drawn for him is informed again of Mr Hogarth's necessity for the money if therefore his Lordship does not send for it in three days it will be disposed of with the addition of a tail and some other little appendages to Mr Hare the fa∣mous wildbeast man Mr Hogarth having given that gen∣tleman a conditional promise of it for an exhibition of pic∣tures on his Lordship's refusal"  This intimation had the desired effect the picture was sent for home and committed to the flames  ACCOUNT OF A MOST AWEFUL CHANGE IN A YOUNG LADY OF EIGHTEEN ADDRESSED TO A FRIEND  MY DEAR FRIEND  I Shall rouze your tenderest feelings when I inform you that you will no more behold the lovely and beloved Miss Single∣hand She departed her state of trial on Sunday last in the eighteenth year of her age  That which brought her to her present situation has long preyed on her vitals On the day just mentioned the con∣queror came with irresistible authority as a king of terrors indeed but in his mildest form and laid his victorious hand on her about ten o'clock in the morning from which time till night she held a state of uncertain existence at last about midnight that amiable countenance which used to glow with sweet modesty was shrouded in darkness and the spoiler tri∣umphed over beauties which were once the desire or the envy of both sexes  The first attack of her disorder was at a review in the Park where Colonel Scarlet whose manly and polite address is so well known commanded the regiment near which she stood A sweetlypainful palpitation on a sudden seized her till then peaceful bosom but this gave her little alarm ignorant as she was of the nature of her malady and by no means expect∣ing the consequences which it has now produced When she came home she felt anxiety and restlessness yet it did not ap∣pear that she had caught cold She was fond of solitude and  apt to tremble and change colour she complained but that only when alone of an uneasiness in her breast was observed to lean her cheek on her hand and frequently to wipe the trickling tear which accompanied the involuntary halfbroken sigh  Some of her friends were apprehensive for her senses and indeed several of her actions appeared destitute of that pru∣dence goodsense and gaiety for which she was before re∣markable To study long at her lookingglass to be angry with her headdress to talk to herself like one delirious of groves and fountains soldiers parents and wrinkled old age with a thousand other incoherent subjects were circumstances very suspicious indeed But whatever her disorder was she was very shy of giving any intimation which might lead to a discovery of it  It is proper you should know that Colonel Scarlet was by this time pretty intimate at her father's and from him was learned what chiefly led her friends to a knowledge of her complaint They endeavoured to administer such remedies as were calculated to remove her disease but in vain it evi∣dently increased A jaunt into the country a round of ele∣gant amusements solitude or company seemed each to feed her complaint rather than remove it The attention of the colonel to her situation at this time was exceedingly diligent and tender be professed the utmost concern for her welfare and interested himself in all that was done for her his coun∣tryfeat his coach and his fortune were all at her service and he seemed willing to give even himself for her happiness  In this situation of things and as the last resourceall other advice proving ineffectualrecourse was had to a cler∣gyman He spoke to her very seriously concerning the change of state before her enquired into the situation of her mind with respect to the approaching awful period informed her of the new birth to be expected the remedy against sin and the society and comfort of the blissful mansions quoting several texts to the purpose He gave her many suitable exhortations to love her lord with all her heart and obey his will and di∣rected her concerning the endowment of wordly goods and such other subjects as are common on these occasions Dur∣ing all which exhortations she seemed in great agitation and made answer with a faltering tongue hope and tear shame joy and trembling apprehension alternately possessing her breast  Her father gave her up with great composure but her mother not without many tears The colonel who was pre∣sent and much interested in all that passed gave her several  tokens of his high esteem and good wishes which she ac∣cepted with downcast eyes and a scarcely audible voice The spectators seemed to think her exceedingly well prepared and whispered to each other about her uprightness faith virtue constancy and a thousand other amiable qualifications for a state of happiness  When this scene was over she appeared somewhat more composed and tasted a little and but a little refreshment She seemed to have forebodings of her fate and expected that night to commence her state of lasting misery or bliss  Some of her young female acquaintance helped her to un∣dress and endeavoured to console her They told her that it was what they must all come to that they doubted not she would be happy and sympathetically wished that their time was also come This afforded but little allay to her anxious expectation she expressed great backwardness to depart and trembled to think what torments she might ere long endure Then turning her thoughts to the brighter scenes she ex∣pressed her hope that however sharp the struggles of nature might be she should nevertheless experience all beyond them to be delight and joy Taking therefore an affectionate fare∣wel of her young companions she composed herself to meet her destiny and with a groan was received into the bosom of her lord  LOVELETTER FROM AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY TO A WIDOW WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN  THOUGH I never Madam had the happiness to see youno not so much as in a pictureand conse∣quently can no more tell what complexion you are of than one who lives in the remotest parts of China I am neverthe∣less most passionately in love with you and this affection has taken such deep root in my heart that on my conscience I could die a martyr for you with as much chearfulness as thousands have done for their religion who were as ignorant of the truth for which they died as I am of your ladyship  This declaration Madam may surprize you but you will cease to wonder when I have acquainted you what it was that not only gave birth to my passion but has effectually confirmed it Last week having occasion to ride into Surry about some particular business I noticed not far from the road a most magnificent seat My curiosity was instantane∣ously raised to know the owner of so beautiful a pile and  being informed that it belongs to your ladyship I began that very moment to have a very strong inclination for you When therefore I was farther assured that some two thou∣sand acres of the best ground in England appertained to this noble fabrick together with a fine park delightful gardens variety of fishponds and other desirable conveniences I then fell up to the ears in love and resolved to enlist myself among the number of your humble servants and sincere admirers  "The owner of so many fine things" said I to myself "must needs be the finest women in the world What though she be oldher trees are green What though she may have lost the lilies and the roses in her cheeksshe has enough left in her gardens What though she should be barrenher fields are sufficiently fruitful"  With these thoughts in my head I alighted from my horse and at once became so enamoured of your ladyship that I told my passion to every tree in your park and by the bye they are the tallest straightest loveliest finest shapedtrees I ever beheld in my life  I now appeal to your ladyship whether any lover was ever influenced by more solid motives than your devoted humble servant Those who are wholly captivated by beauty will infallibly find their passion decay with the transitory charm which at first attracted their regard and those who pretend to admire a woman merely for the qualities of her mind must consider her soul as abstracted from her body but he who loves not a woman in the flesh as well as in the spirit is only fit in my opinion to make love to a spectre whereas my passion the sincerity of which you cannot possibly doubt is built on the same foundation with your house grows with your trees and will daily increase with your estate  For any thing I know to the contrary you may be the handsomest woman in the kingdom but whether you are so or not signifies little while you have fortune enough to six my affection I am a soldier my profession and as I have fought for pay by Heaven's blessing I mean to love for money  All your other suitors would speak the same language if they were equally honest and should you favour this blunt address by making choice of me I can add for your com∣fort that you will be the first woman on record from the creation to the present hour who ever loved a man for telling her the truth  THE WIDOW's ANSWER  THOUGH Sir I have never had the satisfaction of seeing you and my fancy cannot possibly form an idea of your person from the ingenuous frankness of your epistle and the  matchless impudence of your address I am equally inclined to love and to despise you That you could die a martyr for me with as much chearfulness as thousands have done for their religion I can by no means believe for in the next world I have neither a house nor a tree that I can call my own and were such a tragicomical event to take place I much question whether I should have the smallest reason to wish it otherwise This declaration Sir may surprize you but you will cease to wonder when I tell you that I have no very favourable opinion of a soldier My last husband was an of∣ficer in the army young handsome intelligent and blest with every requisite save one to render me perfectly happy"Save one" you will reply "What could that be"CONSTANCY Sir the basis of felicity in a conjugal state He loved the women indiscriminately me apparently more than the rest because it was more to his interest My per∣sonal property became his the moment we were married but my real estate with which you are so much enamoured he could not touch without my consent This kept him in good humour for he well knew that if he displeased me I should at my decease bequeath the whole to a poor relation and leave him the pill of disappointment to carry off the dregs of in∣solence Thus happily fortified against the tyranny of his na∣tural disposition I lived in tolerable ease with him for the space of three years when a lingering intermittent brought on a consumption which soon closed the career of his life and made me an inheritor of liberty at large This sudden re∣version of my fate from subjection to freedom was the grand desideratum of my wishes and as I have known a depri∣vation of liberty I shall now set the higher value on that inestimable blessing Instead therefore of giving you the encouragement you solicit I must tell you frankly that hav∣ing known the joys of matrimony as well as it's inconveni∣ences I am not inclined to purchase a moment's pleasure with an age of pain I am now my own mistress subject to no controul and above the censure of the impertinent What∣ever may be your opinion of me after the perusal of this let∣ter be assured it is not in your power however specious your arguments or captivating your person may be to disturb for one moment the tranquillity of her who having known the duplicity and inconstancy of one will never entrust to another that happiness which she now finds in her own bosom I am Sir with as much sincerity your lover as I wish you to be mine  SIR SIMON AND HODGE OR THE ADDITIONAL WRINKLE  BY MR HARRISON  AS Hodge one day was swelt'ring in the sun  A dry old dog yet a true child of fun  Sir Simon came to see his man so blithe  Panting beneath the labour of his scythe  For Hodge had risen ere the early dawn  'Twas now high noon nor yet clean shav'd the lawn  Much had he done which he was pleas'd to view  But curs'd the little that remain'd to do  His arms were weary and his aged back  Seem'd ev'ry sinew at each bend to crack  At ev'ry stroke the drops of sweat fast pace  Down the rough furrows of his timeplough'd face  And still he stops though he can scarcely stand  To sweep his dewy forehead with his hand  With frequent rubbings whets his ling'ring blade  And sighs for ev'ning and the fresh'ning shade  Now old Sir Simon was as queer a soul  As Hodge himself but nothing like so droll  He had some wit and thought that he had more  As many a greater wit has done before  And many another we may well maintain  Has done so since and will do so again  "Hodge" says Sir Simon "you can't well be dry  For you are wet enough I see to fry  Now had you been but dry enough to burn  A jug of ale had done you no illturn"  Hodge smil'd at very mention of the nappy  But at the sight was wondrously more happy  For now Sir Simon having had his joke  Drew the full pitcher from beneath his cloak  Hodge seiz'd with eager hand the foaming prize  And heav'nward raising both his grateful eyes  Fast down his throat the welcome liquor pours  Nor heeds his master loudly though he roars  "Stop Hodge why Hodge zounds Hodge why don't you stop  I'm thirsty too zounds Hodge leave me a drop"  Sir Simon bawl'd as loud as he could bawl  But Hodge ne'er stopp'd till he had swallow'd all  As flowly now he panting gains his breath  That seem'd awhile o'ermatch'd by struggling death  "Hodge" says Sir Simon "pry'thee canst not hear  Why zounds I bade thee not drink all the beer  Deuce take thy throat mine's hoarse with so much bawl  I've half a mind to ram down jug and all  I told thee I was dry as well as thee  But not a drop plague take thee 's left for me"  Hodge now affected wonderful surprize  And like a pig's just stuck appear'd his eyes  "Lord Sir" says Hodge seemingly vast contrite  Though bent by trick to pacify the knight  "Ise be main sorry thus to give offence  But to a person of your worship's sense  Ise need not say for that would be absurd  While a man drinks he ne'er can hear one word"  "Not hear while drinking" straight Sir Simon cries  Fill'd in his turn with a stuck pig's surprize  "Why surewhy sure Hodgethat can never be  Egad I'll fetch another jug and see"  Away the knight with his best speed then went  To find the truth as told by Hodge intent  And Hodge mean time contriv'd the means to make  Sir Simon what he said for Gospel take  "Now Hodge" the knight returning cried "we'll try  If what you tell me truth be or a lye  I'll drink and you must bellow"Stop stop stop  Do pray Sir" you may add "leave me a drop"  This when I hear I certainly will do  So as I drink remember Hodge bawl you"  Sir Simon heav'd the pitcher to his head  Hodge op'd his mouth but not a word he said  Yet gap'd so wide there seem'd abundant fear  The fellow meant to tear from ear to ear  "This truth so strange" to Hodge Sir Simon cried  "I ne'er would have believ'd had I not tried  Thus Hodge it is though life wears fast away  Wiser and wiser we grow ev'ry day  This time thou hadst I fairly own most brains  So freely take the liquor for thy pains"  Hodge thus got paid for playing off his wit  And pleas'd his master was though he was bit  Convine'd that he had gain'd a wrinkle more  No matter wherethan e'er he had before  THE RAZORGRINDER A COMICK TALE  BY PETER PIKDAR ESQ  A Fellow in a market fown  Most musical cried razors up and down  And offer'd twelve for eighteen pence  Which certainly seem'd wondrous cheap  And for the money quite a heap  As ev'ry man would buy with cash and sense  A country bumpkin the great offer heard  Poor Hodge who suffer'd by a broad black beard  That seem'd a shoebrush stuck beneath his nose  With chearfulness the eighteenpence he paid  And proudly to himself in whispers said  "This rascal stole the razors I suppose"  "No matter if the fellow  he  a knave  Provided that the razors  shave  It certainly will be a monstrous prize"  So home the clown with his good fortune went  Smiling in heart and soul content  And quickly soap'd himself to ears and eyes  Being well lather'd from a dish or tub  Hodge now began with grinning pain to grub  Just like a hedger cutting furze  'Twas a vile razorthen the rest he tried  All were impostors"Ah" Hodge sigh'd  "I wish my eighteenpence within my purse"  In vain to chace his beard and bring the graces  He cut and dug and winc'd and stamp'd and swore  Brought blood and danc'd blasphem'd and made wry faces  And curs'd each razor's body o'er and o'er  His MUZZLE form'd of  opposition  stuff  Firm as a Foxite would not lose it's rough  So kept itlaughing at the steel and suds  Hodge in a passion stretch'd his angry jaws  Vowing the direst vengeance with clench'd claws  On the vile CHEAT that sold the goods  "Razors a damn'd confounded dog  Not fit to scrape a hog"  Hodge sought the fellowsound him and begun  "P'rhaps Master Razorrogue to you 'tis fun  "That people flea themselves out of their lives  You rascal for an hour I have been grubbing  Giving my scoundrel whiskers here a scrubbing  With razors just like oyster knives  Sirrah I tell you you're a knave  To cry up razors that can't  shave  "  "Friend" quoth the razorman "I am no knave  As for the razors you have bought  Upon my soul I never thought  That they would  shave"  "Not think they'd shave" quoth Hodge with won'ring eyes  And voice not much unlike an Indian yell  "What were they made for then you dog" he cries  "Made" quoth the fellow with a smile  "to sell"  THE DERNIER RESORT A FAMILIAR EPISTLE  NO no by all the powers above  My heart's as little touch'd by love  As ever in my life  Full well dear Hal to thee is known  Whom Fortune to my lot has thrown  To be my wedded wife  But why I wed should any ask  To answer is an easy task  Want Want my honest Harry  What can a man whose fortune's spent  Who has mortgag'd to his utmost rent  But drown or shoot or marry  Of these the best is sure the bride  For when one's plung'd beneath the tide  Adieu to all our figure  Full sudden is the pistol's fate  When once 'tis touch'd alas too late  We wish undrawn the trigger  'Tis thus resolv'd then honest boy  Tomorrow thou may'st wish me joy  Joy will I buy by wiving  Soon to her mansion far from town  Six rapid bays shall whirl us down  As if the de'el were driving  There shall the brisk capacious bowl  Drown every care that haunts the soul  And rouze me to a new life  And ha for all that she can say  Some blooming village queen of May  Shallwait upon my true wife  When all the tedious farce is o'er  And spouse has crown'd me with her dow'r  Should sudden ruin meet her  E'en tho' her coachman broke her neck  Unmov'd I'd stand amidst the wreck  Nor swear at heedless Peter  THE APRIL FOOL  BY MR HARRISON  "TOday" says Dick "is Aprilday  And though so mighty wife you be  A bett whate'er you like I'll lay  Ere night I make a fool of thee"  "A fool I may be made 'tis true  But Dick" cries Tom "ne'er be afraid  No man can make a fool of you  For you're a fool already made"  DESCRIPTION OF HOLLAND  A Country that draws fifty foot of water  In which men live as in the hold of nature  And when the sea does in upon them break  And drown a province does but spring a leak  That always ply the pump and never think  They can be safe but at the rate they stink  That live as if they had been run aground  And when they die are cast away and drown'd  That dwell in ships like swarm of rats and prey  Upon the goods all nations fleets convey  And when their merchants are blown up and crackt  Whole towns are cast away in storms and wreckt  That feed like Cannibals on other fishes  And serve their cousingermans up in dishes  A land that rides at anchor and is moor'd  In which they do not live but go aboard  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS PLATE III  The Idle 'Prentice at Play in the Church Yard during Divine Service  THE COMICK MAGAZINE  NUMBER III  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE III THE IDLE 'PRENTICE AT PLAY IN THE CHURCHYARD DURING DIVINE SERVICE  IN this admirable Print a fine contrast is afforded to the preceding one Here while the virtuous and industrious youth is performing the duty of a pious Christian his indolent and vicious fellowapprentice lies stretched on a tombstone and gambling with the vilest associates They are playing at hustlecap and Tom Idle is in the act of cheating by a concealment of some of the half pence under the broad brim of his hat  A Shoeblack distinguished by his stool basket and brushes challenges the fraud and their prosligate Companion with a black patch over his eye is resolutely insisting on fair play  So deeply are they engaged in the dispute that the Beadle summoned by the noise of their quarrel approaches unperceived to chastise them with his cane The first intimation of the Beadle's presence is obviously signified by a smart application of the rattan on the culprit's back  That the filthiest and most slothful wretches are under the necessity of continually employing their hands however re∣luctantly is manifest in the active search of the Shoeblack beneath his rags as well as the similar diligence of the Lad with his hat scratched more than half off his head who are both evidently infested by an enemy that compels them to be busy with their singers  HERE LIES THE BODY OF is inscribed with the peculiar felicity of Hogarth on the tomb where lazy Tom is seen stretched at fulllength  The skulls and other bones near the open grave are not only characteristick of the scene but serve to increase as it were the turpitude of the offenders by displaying their hardened and abominable insensibility to objects which cannot be sur∣veyed without a degree of aweful horror by all who possess the common feelings of humanity  The fatality of associating with such miscreants will be abundantly demonstrated in the succeeding series where the fellow with a black patch over one eye first encountered at a sort of gamingtable in a churchyard leads Tom Idle a not unwilling votary into the depths of iniquity and then like the archbetrayer of mankind compleatly abandons him  The motto is literally appropriate to the scene  "Judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools"  Proverbs xix  PROFESSIONAL SPEECHES AT A BRUISING MATCH  BY MR HARRISON  AS I was a few days ago crossing Moorfields I perceived a large crowd of people gathered together making a noise to the full as confused and generally speaking to the full as unintelligible as could possibly be heard at the famous building of the Tower of Babel  I am naturally averse to such assemblies but as I was at a loss to know with certainty from what cause it originated curiosity prompted me to visit the scene of action where I beheld one of the most stubborn battles between a coalheaver and a carman that perhaps ever was seen at the trifling ex∣pence of a tolerable handkerchief and an old memorandumbook of no use to any one but the rightowner  What struck me most forcibly during this conflict was the jargon which flew about on the occasion and in which as the company probably consisted of almost every different species of artificers and labourers I thought I could discover striking traits of their respective professions  If the reader possesses himself of the same idea he may pro∣bably peruse the following minutes of such parts of the collo∣quy as I could distinguish with a satisfaction nearly equal to that which I myself felt  SAILOR  Smite my eyes Jack why don't you get to windward splice me if I wouldn't soon knock out the lubber's starboardeye Box his compass run in under his guns get into his

diamond work his pate into putty make the sun shine through him close his peepers my hearty  These are the chief speeches which occur to me but they will probably bring many similar ones to the remembrance of most readers  With respect to the event of the battle it is only necessary to observe that after the combatants had bruised each other till neither of them was able to see or stand it was agreed that a final decision of their dispute should be deferred till another op∣portunity In the mean time I found that the contest was of a very important nature being intended to decide no less a question than whether a coalheaver or a carman was the most respectable profession  ADDRESS TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF ENGLAND  AND really a good sort of people ye are when ye are pleased The task is not difficult to bring ye into good∣humour neither but I defy all the artists in Europe to keep you so  Ye love to find fault nay to make faults and if you cannot quarrel with your neighbours you will fall out with yourselves like the greyhound who used to grow angry at his own tail  You may say that I am guilty of injustice and that ye are affable humane friendly charitable social sweettempered  selfdenying beings if every person was to draw his own picture the penandink portrait would appear so but I who have looked upon life for above twenty years as an uncon∣cerned spectator of all the fantasticalness with which mankind have fatigued themselvesto me ye appear selfish stubborn querulous conceited discontented existences and ever en∣joy more than ye deserve yet are daily wishing for more en∣joyments and to do less to deserve them  I dined yesterday at Mr Fineer's and his eldest son being introduced according to the ancient family custom of shew∣ing the visitors how much wit the heir has one of the guests addressed his papa with"I suppose Sir you will bring mas∣ter up to your business""Bring him up to be a hangman rather" was the parent's answer "No no he shall never be brought up to work all his lifetime for nothing as I have done" And yet this person has gained by his own industry and success in trade upwards of four thousand pounds But thus it is we covet to enjoy still more than we do and want still to do less for it  Epictetus says mankind are dissatisfied Senecca says they are discontented and this is what both before and since Se∣neca every person has been saying who could say any thing  With your leave good people I shall present you with a couple of characters as it is common for those who suppose themselves to be artists to exhibit specimens of their perform∣ances I offer these with submission and tell me if you please how you like them  They are sketches of a Farmer and a Hopplanter  In the harvest season that particular month of Providence's bounty when all the animal creation appears chearfully in∣dustrious and we may even fancy approaching Winter to bear a smile on his weatherworn wrinkles when he views the store that is gathering in to comfort him while he visits us yet even then congratulate the Farmer on the noble prospect of his wellcovered acres he will shake his head and be∣tween a sigh and a grunt he will answer you with"Ah but the straw is short"  If the straw is long then he will tell you there is no sub∣stance in the grain  If there is but an indifferent crop he laments that it will not pay the expence of housing and threshing  If a plentiful crop then he grumbles corn will be so cheap it will not be worth carrying to market  Just so the Hopplanter he rises lifts up the sash and looks over the horizon if the morning happens to be cloudy he  pulls down the window with an oath saying"It will rain today and all the blossoms will be washed off"  If there should be a pleasant air abroad then the poles will be all blown down  If the sun shines "O Lord the plants will be burned up"  If it is a close dry day without much sunshine or wind then he wishes for rain to destroy the vermin or else they will eat all the buds up  The reader who neither owns hopgrounds nor rents corn∣lands will wonder how these persons can be so discontented Yet it is an even bett that those who seem to be amazed at such grumblers are as dissatisfied themselves the symptoms of the distemper may be different but the disease is the same in almost all  Half the cure is supposed to be performed when the physi∣cian knows the patient's disorder Indeed my good people neighbours countrymen and choice spirits I do know bonâ fide that you are disordered and know that you disorder is nay would prescribe for you but imagine my medicines will be thrown away  Suppose I order you a few grains of selfknowledge half a drachm of patience and a scruple of selfdenial mixed up with a teaspoonful of the syrup of humanity will any of you take such an electuary Ye might taste it indeed for the novelty's sake but I will bett a handful of integrity against all court ceremonies that ye spit it out again  Folly has thrown your heads into hystericks and I will say opinion against commonsense which are the greatest odds that can be offered not one man in many dozens knows what is the matter with himself  Last week I called on an old acquaintance his lady told me her spouse was disturbed and disordered at something she could not tell for what and that she was happy at my calling be∣cause she hoped I would get him into spirits again  I went to him into his study there he sat discontented as an undone gamester I took him by the hand and enquired if he was ill He replied that thank God he enjoyed as good a state of health as any man in the world I desired to know if his affairs were any way complicated which might make him uneasy His reply was"Sir I do not owe any person a shilling and my income greatly exceeds my outsets" "I hope Sir no words have happened betwixt your lady and you""There is not a better woman breathing Sir and we live in continued harmony""How does your daughter Sir""Married Sir and as happy as I am""Your son at college""My son Sir contributes to my happiness I  hear every body praise him""What then Sir can you be uneasy about""See there Sir" my friend replied rais∣ing his voice at the same time and pulling some printed papers out of his pocket "There Sir read there There is the Gazetteer and the General and the Ledger and the He∣rald and the Chronicle and the Morning Post Who can enjoy themselves when we read such terrible accounts as they give us not only of the government but also of them∣selves Mercy upon us but we are a boughtandsold nation"  With some difficulty I persuaded him to come into company again and once more be himself and leave the study of poli∣ticks alone to those who loved to be imposed on  I told him all that a man of sense ought to do was to con∣form to the laws of God and his country to take things as they were use them as they should be act with as much in∣tegrity to mankind as the customs of the world would suffer and independent and contented enjoy the pleasures of domes∣tick society and wait with patience for that awful that allinteresting event when empire breaks his sceptre and beauty ceases to be amiable when faction is dissipated the phantom of pride vanished and all the worldly distinctions are buried in a deathbed dissolution  CHARACTER OF A HARE ESQ A VERY EXTRAORDINARY COUNTRY GENTLEMAN  PERMIT this letter to inform you that there is coming up to town by the Norwich coach one who has lived most part of his time in our neighbourhood if indeed he is not a native of this county but of that I cannot be positive neither is it very material as I can notwithstanding give you a sufficient account of him for your conduct respecting the re∣ception and treatment which it will be proper to give him having furnished him for he never was in town beforewith a direction to your house His conduct in time past has been though not totally irreprehensible as innocent at least as that of most others Some few complaints I have heard of his depredations in the gardens if not in the orchards of his neighbours but yet they have been ready to acknowledge at the same time they believe he thought no harm It is true he was rather wild in his youth but never extravagant or gay in dress Living wholly in the country he has no notion of the amusements of the town but being remarkably light of foot has not been able entirely to absent himself from field di∣versions  nor yet has he indulged himself in them Upon such occasions he has been much sought and when he has been only just seen or as it were had in view it is surpriz∣ing how the rest of the company have exulted and much has been in the words of the poet on other joyous occasions "the clamour of men of boys and dogs" But though every body else has appeared highly delighted I have reason to believe he never enjoyed peace of mind at such riotous doings for he has always endeavoured to leave them as soon as he could and sometimes he has stolen away and left them at a fault for want of his company But how forcible is unprofitable com∣pany At other times a more select party have compelled him to take the lead and go greater lengths than he approved which has still been attended with uneasiness of mind and frequently has he been turned but lately on an occasion of that sort he received so severe a check in the midst of his ca∣reer that it entirely put a stop to his progress in that way and to tell you the truth is the cause of his leaving the coun∣try at this time Though much altered in that respect I believe he is still what may be called harebrained which I suppose you will discover before he has been long in your company Unaccustomed to being frequently in much com∣pany as well as naturally timid and shy even in the country it is not to be expected he will ever be capable of entertaining a very large company but a few select friends I believe will be very well satisfied with what they can obtain from him or pick out of him And let me tell you however unlikely it may seem he will bear a roasting as well as most only take this information along with you as he is a mere rustick and has indulged his appetite in the country without scruple though with strict temperance it may not be amiss to fill his belly with pudding and perhaps a glass of wine may not be illbestowed before you try that experiment upon him Of the family of the Hares you have doubtless heard I have some notion one of them attained to considerable dignity in the national church but the subject of this letter though of the same name is not of that family but of one more ancient nor did ever one of these profess with them not but that I lately read an account in the newspapers of one of this family who went to a place of publick worship in time of service but I believe with no more devotion than some others whom I have heard called Thorough Churchmen from their going as it is most likely he did in at one door and out at the other Though this family cannot boast of places or pensions from the court they have not been totally disregarded by the le∣gislature  The nobility and gentry having put it out of the power as far as acts of parliament with united associations to enforce them can do it of the small vulgar to exercise their merciless tempers upon them as they were too apt to do if they could only extort from them a meal's meat by it and sometimes merely for the diversion of following them from place to place and yet I believe if they were to speak all the truth we should find themselves more frequently injured and more wantonly persecuted by their professed protectors than any other men and may I not add perhaps they are not alone in that predicament But as this letter is not intended to be a vehicle for political or disaffected reflections on men and measures I shall conclude with wishing the subject of it may arrive safe at your house and give your wife and your∣self as much satisfaction as it gives me pleasure to have such an opportunity of subscribing myself  Your affectionate friend RIGDUM FUNNIDOS  SPECIMEN OF BEAU NASH'S MANNER OF TELLING A STORY  I Will tell you something to that purposethat I fancy will make you laugh A covetous old parson as rich as the devil scraped a fresh acquaintance with me several years ago at Bath I knew him when he and I were students at Oxford where we both studied damnationly hard but that is neither here nor there Well very well I entertained him at my house in John's Courtno my house in John's Court was not built thenbut I entertained him with all that the city could afford the rooms the musick and every thing in the 'world On his leaving Bath he pressed me very bard to return the visit and desired me to let him have the pleasure of seeing me at his house in Devonshire About six months after I happened to be in that neighbourhood and was resolved to see my old friend from whom I expected a very warm reception Well I knocks at his door when an old queer creature of a maid came to the door and denied him I suspected however that he was at home and going into the parlour what should I see but the parson's legs up the chimney where he had thrust himself to avoid entertaining me This was very well "My dear" says I to the maid "it is very cold extreme cold indeed and I am afraid I have got a touch of my ague light me the fire if you please""La Sir" says the maid who was a modest creature to be sure "the chimney smokes monstrously you would not bear the  room for three minutes together" By the greatest good luck there was a bundle of straw on the hearth and I called for a candle The candle came "Well good woman" says I "since you will not light me a fire I will light one for my∣self" and in a moment the straw was all in a blaze This quickly unkennelled the old fox there he stood in an old rusty nightgown blessing himself and looking likeahem egad  Here I stand gentlemen who could once leap fortytwo feet upon level ground at three standingjumps backward or forward one two threedart like an arrow out of a bow but I am old now I remember I once leaped for three hun∣dred guineas with Count Clopstock the great leaper leaping∣master to the Prince of Passau you must all have heard of him First he began with the runningjump and a most damnable bounce it was that is certain Every body concluded that he had the match hollow when only taking off my hat stripping off neither coat shoes nor stockingsmind meI fetches a run and went beyond him one foot three inches and three quarters measured upon my soul by Captain Pately's own standard  THE SPEAKING DOG A PERSIAN STORY  TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH  A King of Persia who was in the sixtythird year of his age grew so doating fond of one of his concubines a fair Circassian named Roxana that he obliged himself by a solemn oath never to refuse her any thing she should request of him The lady made her advantage of this monarch's weakness and every day by some new and extravagant de∣mand took occasion to gratify her ambition her avarice or her revenge During the career of her power a certain Eu∣ropean merchant who had sold her some jewels in order to engage her interest and protection at court made her a pre∣sent of a beautiful little dog which had been taught to dance and play a thousand antick tricks In a short time Roxana became as fond of her dog as the king was of her only she lamented that the little creature was not endowed with speech and could not therefore make a proper reply to those endear∣ing expressions she used as often as she caressed him One of her eunuchs then present told her she need not grieve on this account for he knew a philosopher named Hali then living in the suburbs of Ispahan who could teach her dog to speak the Persian language as articulately as he spoke it himself  that he had learned this art from a Grecian sage who had not only given speech to dogs and other animals of his country but had rendered them as learned and knowing as those great men among the ancients who had been bred in the schools of Athens Hali was immediately sent for made acquainted with this business and required to attend the next morning to give the dog his first lesson It was in vain for the poor man to remonstrate against the possibility of such an undertaking he was answered it was the king's command and must not be disputed that if he performed what was enjoined him in the space of thirty days he should be amply rewarded if he failed he should lose his head  Hali we may imagine considered the king's command as the artifice of his enemies and as a trap which they had laid for his life He communicated his distress to his eldest son a youth of nineteen who had a ready wit and excellent parts which had been well cultivated and improved by his wise fa∣ther's instructions He had besides a most engaging manner of address a great sweetness of temper and a beautiful person Mirzafor that was the young man's nameburst into tears when he heard the king's orders but immediately recovering himself he told his father that he had thought of a certain method to divert the danger which threatened their family  For this purpose he desired Hali to present him the next morning to the chief eunuch as his daughter and as a person well instructed in her father's art and who would engage at the hazard of her own life as well as his to execute the king's injunction and thereby merit his grace and favour Hali looked upon his son with amazement and persuading himself that he spoke by the inspiration of the Prophet who had taken their house under his protection he made no diffi∣culty of complying with young Mirza's request  Accordingly next morning Mirza disguised in a virgin's habit was conducted to the chief eunuch and by him led into Roxana's apartment where he performed his part so well that before the month expired it was reported all over the seraglio that the philosopher's daughter had taught the little dog not only to speak but to speak like a wise man and an∣swer pertinently to every question The king would needs be assured of the truth of this prodigy He made a visit to his favourite she confirmed the report and the dog being pre∣sented to him was commanded to give a proof of his ex  ra∣ordinary talents by answering respectfully whatever the king should be pleased to ask him  The monarch seated himself on a sopha and taking the dog in his arms gently stroked his headand he stroked it  and she stroked it and she stroked it and he stroked it  I have translated this parenthesis word for word It seems to have some alleg  ical sense which I do not comprehend The gentlemen who are le  ned in the doctrine of in  endoes may probably discover the author's meaning  and then he proposed this question "Say thou pretty ani∣mal who am I" After a short silence Roxana entreated the king to tell her if he was not highly delighted with the answer which the little beast had made him and whether he could ever have believed the thing if he had not heard it The king protested he had not heard a word at which Roxana seemed much concerned and looking earnestly in the king's face demanded again if his majesty had not heard the dog answer him in the words following"You are the son of the sun the lieutenant of the prophets and the king of kings you are dreaded by your enemies adored by your subjects and passionately beloved by my fair mistress"  The King of Persia rose up amazed and confounded but still insisting he did not hear the dog speak Roxana lifted up her hands and thus addressed herself to Mahomet"Thou mes∣senger of God protect and defend the king increase his ho∣nour lengthen his life preserve his understanding and open his ears and O nevernever let him feel the infirmities of old age" Then the dog being ordered to speak a little louder she begged the king to make a second trial which he did with great success for he now declared he heard the little creature distinctly utter every word just as Roxana had before repeated  This occasioned an universal joy in the seraglio Nothing was talked of for some days but the speaking dog His an∣swer to the king was written in letters of gold and preserved in the archives of the empire The pretended daughter of Hali was dismissed with a noble reward and her father was soon afterwards promoted to one of the best governments in Persia  The author of this tale concludes it with the following re∣flection  Old age very seldom proves a blessing to great men espe∣cially to these who have any share in the government of the world The Persian monarch who ruled so many nations and esteemed himself a favourite of the gods and the first man in the universe was not permitted the use of his eyes or his ears He was the dupe of his slave and the jest of his whole court but no one durst tell him so and he died with∣out knowing it  THE RIVAL ORATORS  ONE Sunday during last summer while the weather was extremely hot the windows of a certain parish church in the diocese of Gloucester were set open to admit more air while the congregation was assembled for divine service Just as the clergyman was beginning his weekly discoursewho by the bye is not much celebrated for his oratorial powersa Jackass which had been grazing in the churchyard popped his head in at the window and began braying with all his might as if in opposition to the reverend preacher On this a wag present immediately got up from his seat and with great gravity of countenance exclaimed"One at a time gentlemen if you please" The whole congregation set up a loud laugh when the Jackass took fright and gave up the contestthough from the clergyman's chagrin and confusion he would probably not have proved the worst orator  HUMOROUS ANECDOTE OF DR SOUTH AND AN OLD COUPLE WHO WANTED TO BE MARRIED  DR South when he resided at Caversham in Oxfordshire was called out of bed on a cold winter's morning by his clerk to marry a couple who were then waiting for him The doctor hurried up and went shivering to church but seeing only an old man of seventy with a woman about the same age and his clerk he asked the latter in a pet where the bride∣groom and bride were and what that man and woman wanted The old man replying that they came there to be married The doctor looked sternly at him and exclaimed"Married" "Yes married" said the old man hastily "better marry than do worse""Go get you gone you silly old souls" said the doctor "get home and do your wor  " And then hobbled out of church in a great passion with his clerk for calling him out of bed on such a ridiculous errand  STATESMEN LIKE SWINE OR THE FARMER'S POLICY  A Patriotick candidate applied to a yeoman of a certain county for his vote promising to exert his influence to turn out the ministry and procure a fresh s  t "Then I won't vote for you" cried the farmer "Why not" said the p  riot "I thought you was a friend to your country""So I am" replied the yeoman "and for that reason I am not for  a change in the ministry I know how it is with my hogs when I buy them in lean they eat the devil and all but when they have once got a little fat their keep is not near so expen∣sive I am therefore for keeping the present set as they will devour much less than a new one"  EVERY TUB ON IT'S OWN BOTTOM  A Sailor passing by a cooper's shop and seeing a number of tubs piled above each other at the door began to kick and tumble them about the street The master coming out and desiring to know the reason of this strange proceeding"Damn it" replied Jack "why should not every tub stand upon it's own bottom"  SMART REPARTEE OF A LOMBARDY LASS  A Country girl in Lombardy running after her sheass which was in haste to get up to her foal passed a gentle∣man on the road who seeing her look very buxom and having a mind to be witty called out"Whence do you come sweetheart""From Villejuiff Sir" said she "From Villejuiff" answered the gentleman "and do you know the daughter of Nicholas Guillot who lives there""Very well" replied the girl "Be to kind then" returned he "as to carry her a kiss from me" and throwing his arms round her neck was about to salute her "Hold Sir" cried the wench disentangling herself from his rude embrace "since you are in such a hurry it will be better to kiss my ass as she will be there some time before me"  ART OF KILLING WIVES  BY BISHOP THOMAS  BISHOP Thomas who was a man of great wit and drol∣lery was observing at a  visitation that he had been four times married and should his present wife die he declared he would take another whom it was his opinion he should also survive "Perhaps gentlemen" continued the Bishop "you do not know the art of getting quit of your wives I will tell you how I do I am called a good husband and so I am for I never contradict them But do not you know that the want of contradiction is fatal to women If you contradict them that alone is exercise and health  et optima medicamenta  the best medicine in the worldfor all women but if you con∣stantly give them their own way they will soon languish and p  nc or become gross and lethargick for want of exercise"  THE FISHERMAN AN ITALIAN TALE  BY R K PORTER ESQ  BRIGHT was the setting sun that in the west  Prepar'd the gentry for th' ensuing feast  Order'd by Scala's lord of high renown  Among th' ItaliansI know not the town  My brains have not as yet the secret heard  Which caus'd the guttling of this busy herd  If on the subject I my thoughts may tell  'Twas this that made their appetites to swell  The flesh the fowl and fricasees so nice  The high ragouts so pepper'd all with spice  In short all dainties that were ever seen  To please the tastes of all both fat and lean  The guests assembled in the sumptuous hall  All shapes and sorts plump slender short and tall  Most came before the time they long'd so much  Their maws to open and the meats to touch  Each minute was an hour each hour a day  So slow the eaters drawl'd their time away  And till the instant for the cram appear'd  Nothing but flying compliments were heard  The civil sayings of this hungry crowd  Were interrupted by the speaking loud  Of my Lord's Major Domo in a haste  "My Lord" said he "as you're a lord of taste  And know full well what forms a dainty dish  I come to tell youthere is such a fish  Brought by a manit's equal ne'er can be  Throughout all Italy nor in the sea  But then so strange a price he does demand"  "Pho" cried the Marquis "pay him I command  Whate'er he asks and let the man be gone"  "I would my Lord but money he'll take none"  "What would the fellow then" the Marquis cried  "A hundred lasheson his naked bide  Nor will he bate he swears a single blow  Say shall he have the price or must he go"  The Marquis smil'd then calling ev'ry guest  Chagrin'd and angry from the untouch'd feast  Through the long galleries took his jocund way  Resolv'd to gain the fish whate'er the pay  Now in the court to see the man of eels  On march'd the Count with hunger at his heels  "Well friend" he cried "what ask you for the fish  Ask what you will speak but the price you wish  And I will give it""Humbly then my Lord  And on a poor man's low but sacred word  I cannot bate a stroke from what I've told  For strokes to me are dearer now than gold"  "Here Paulo then" the mighty Scala cried  "Pay this good man but pity his poor hide  His humour's droll and always I pursue  The plan of giving e'en the Devil his due"  The fellow stripp'd and Paul began to whack  A mighty strappado on his bare back  Whose brawny blades the thumps resounded loud  In the hollow maws of this our hungrycrowd  Had a great genius who could tell by face  The soul of each been witness at this place  That such a change could instantly be wrought  Where would have been his art what had he thought  To see so soon such alteration made  As in the faces that were here display'd  But to my tale for near the tale I am  Of this my story that delays the cram  A cram most happy when it did begin  Where with his plate and napkin at his chin  Each gorm'd and guzzl'd in a woeful hurry  Lest he should lose his share of buck or curry  "Mind" said the Fishman "friend I'll only have  As many stripes as I at first did crave  For by the mass these blows are not so sweet  To make me greedy of such poignant meat"  At length when on his back the fiftieth came  "Hold" straight he cried "here we must change the game  The rest my lord are to another due  And justice I revere as well as you  A partner in this business I have got  Nor would I rob him of a single jot  The man your lordship too soon as you see  Will own deserves his share as well as me"  "A partner" cried the Marquis "this is droll  Thou art a curious fellow on my soul  Nor can I penetrate thy strange design  But speak thy will to grant it shall be mine"  "The man I mean my lord fore'd me to vow  Ere through your lordship's gate he let go  That whatsoe'er I got for my reward  The price with him should instantly be shar'd  This man's your porter and my lord I pray  The promis'd debt your sturdy groom may pay"  "Now by the Holy Mother" cried my lord  Strong Paul shall his full share of stripes afford  Call in the rascal he shall have his due  Aye that he shall with swingeing interest too"  His look commanded and the servants ran  To bring with many a shout the guilty man  Who now all frighten'd all beset and bound  The lusty lashes of young Paul  sound  When these with might and main were well laid on  The Marquis sternly bade the wretch be gone  Then turning to the Fisherman thus spoke  "For thy most sage revenge thy pleasant joke  A yearly pension on this very day  To thee my friend I gratefully will pay  Call at my gate nor fear now searr'd his skin  He'll ever hesitate to let thee in"  The Fisherman low bowing straight withdrew  And faster still return'd the hungry crew  Gabbling they posted back with hasty pace  But found no leisure for a word of grace  Eager to mingle in the guttling fray  And greedily devour the various prey  There while with pleasure they o'erload their maws  And clog their senses while they tire their jaws  Be our great care the mind the maw the least  For health and bliss attend the moral feast  JOHN GILPIN  BY W COWPER ESQ  JOHN Gilpin was a citizen  Of credit and renown  A trainband captain eke was he  Of famous London town  John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear  "Though wedded we have been  These twice ten tedious years yet we  No holiday have seen  "Tomorrow is our weddingday  And we will then repair  Unto the Bell at Edmonton  All in a chaise and pair  "My sister and my sister's child  Myself and children three  Will fill the chaise so you must ride  On horseback after we"  He soon replied"I do admire  Of womankind but one  And you are she my dearest dear  Therefore it shall be done  "I am a linendraper hold  As all the world does know  And my good friend the callender  Will lend his horse to go"  Quoth Mrs Gilpin"That's well said  And for that wine is dear  We will be furnish'd with our own  Which is so bright and clear"  John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wise  O'erjoy'd was he to find  That though on pleasure she was bent  She had a frugal mind  The morning came the chaise was brought  But yet was not allow'd  To drive up to the door lest all  Should say that she was proud  So three doors off the chaise was staid  Where they did all get in  Six precious souls and all agog  To dash through thick and thin  Smack went the whip round went the wheels  Were never folks so glad  The stones did rattle underneath  As if Cheapside were made  John Gilpin at his horse's side  Seiz'd fast the flowing mane  And up he got in haste to ride  But soon came down again  For saddletree scarce reach'd had he  His journey to begin  When turning round his face he saw  Three customers come in  So down he came for loss of time  Although it griev'd him sore  Yet loss of pence full well he knew  Would grieve him ten times more  'Twas long before the customers  Were suited to their mind  When Betty scream'd into his cars  "The wine is left behind"  "Good lack" quoth he "yet bring it me  My leathern belt likewise  In which I bear my trusty sword  When I do exercise"  Now Mistress Gilpincareful soul  Had two stonebottles found  To hold the liquor which she lov'd  And keep it safe and sound  Each bottle had two curling cars  Through which the belt he drew  He hung one bottle on each side  To make his balance true  Then over all that he might be  Equipp'd from top to too  His long red cloak wellbrush'd and neat  He manfully did throw  Now see him mounted once again  Upon his nimble steed  Full slowly pacing o'er the stones  With caution and good heed  But finding soon a smoother road  Beneath his wellshod feet  The snorting beast began to trot  Which gall'd him in his seat  "So fair and softly" John did cry  But John he cried in vain  That trot became a gallop soon  In spite of curb or rein  So stooping down as he needs must  Who cannot sit upright  He grasp'd the mane with both his hands  And eke with all his might  Away went Gilpin neek or nought  Away went hat and wig  He little dreamt when he set out  Of running such a rig  The horse who never had before  Been handled in this kind  Affrighted fled and as he flew  Left all the world behind  The wind did blow the cloak did sly  Like streamer long and gay  Till loop and button failing both  At last it flew away  Then might all people well discern  The bottles he had slung  A bottle swinging at each side  As has been said or sung  The dogs did bark the children scream'd  Up flew the windows all  And ev'ry soul cried out"Well done"  As loud as he could bawl  Away went Gilpinwho but he  His fame soon spread around  "He carries weighthe rides a race  'Tis for a thousand pound"  And still as fast as he drew near  'Twas wonderful to view  How in a trice the turnpikemen  Their gates wide open threw  And now as he went bowing down  His reeking head full low  The bottles twain behind his back  Were shatter'd at a blow  Down ran the wine into the road  Most piteous to be seen  And made his horse's flanks to smoke  As he bad bas  ed been  But still he seem'd to carry weight  With leatherngirdle brac'd  For still the bottlenecks were left  Both dangling at his waist  Thus all through merry Islington  These gambols he did play  And till he came unto the Wash  Of Edmonton so gay  And there he threw the Wash about  On both sides of the way  Just like unto a trundlingmop  Or a wildgoose at play  At Edmonton his loving wife  From the balcony spied  Her tender husband wond'ring much  To see how he did ride  "Stop stop John Gilpin here's the house"  They all at once did cry  "The dinner waits and we are tired"  Said Gilpin"So am I"  But ah his horse was not a whit  Inclin'd to tarry there  For whyhis owner had a house  Full ten miles off at Ware  So like an arrow swift he flew  Shot by an archer strong  So did he flywhich brings me to  The middle of my song  Away went Gilpin out of breath  And sore against his will  Till at his friend's the callender's  His horse at last stood still  The callender surpriz'd to see  His friend in such a trim  Laid down his pipe flew to the gate  And thus accosted him  "What news what newsthe tidings tell  Make haste and tell me all  Say why bareheaded you are come  Or why you come at all"  Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit  And lov'd a timely joke  And thus unto the callender  In merry strains he spoke  "I came because your horse would come  And if I well forebode  My hat and wig will soon be here  They are upon the road"  The callender right glad to find  His friend in merry pin  Return'd him not a single word  But to the house went in  Whence straight he came with hat and wig  A wig that droop'd behind  A hat not much the worse for w  ca  Each comely in it's kind  He held them up and in his turn  Thus shew'd his ready wit  "My head is twice as big as yours  They therefore needs must fit  "But let me scrape the dirt away  That hangs about your face  And stop and eatfor well you may  Be in a hungry case"  Said John "It is my weddingday  And folks would gape and stare  If wife should dine at Edmonton  And I should dine at Ware"  Then speaking to his horse he said  "I am in haste to dine  'Twas for your pleasure you came here  You shall go back for mine"  Ah luckless word and bootless boast  For which he paid full dear  For while he spoke a braying ass  Did sing most loud and clear  Whereat his horse did snort as if  He heard a lion rour  And gall  'd off with all his might  As he had done before  Away went Gilpinand away  Went Gilpin's hat and wig  He lost them sooner than at first  For whyThey were too big  Now Gilpin's wife when she had seen  Her husband posting down  Into the country far away  She pull'd out halfacrown  And thus unto the youth she said  That drove them to the Bell  "This shall be yours when you bring back  My husband sase and well"  The youth did ride and soon they met  He tried to stop John's horse  By seizing fast the flowing rein  But only made things worse  For not performing what he meant  And gladly would have done  He thereby frighten'd Gilpin's horse  And made him faster run  Away went Gilpinand away  Went postboy at his heels  The postboy's horse right glad to miss  The lumber of the wheels  Six gentlemen upon the road  Thus seeing Gilpin fly  With postboy scamp'ring in the rear  They rais'd the hueandcry  "Stop thiefstop thiefa highwayman"  Not one of them was mute  So they and all that pass'd that way  Soon join'd in the pursuit  But all the turnpikegates again  Flew open in short space  The men still thinking as before  That Gilpin rode a race  And so he did and won it too  For he got first to town  Nor stopp'd till where he first got up  He did again get down  Now let us sing"Long live the king"  And Gilpin long live he  And when he next does ride abroad  May I be there to see  ALLIANCE WITH FORTUNE  BY MR HARRISON  ONCE in an evil hour of pride  I would to FORTUNE be allied  Straight to the  Dame  I broke my mind  But sound she would

IDLENESS  PLATE IV THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE A FAVOURITE AND EN∣TRUSTED BY HIS MASTER  THIS Print exhibits the consequence resulting from the practice of virtue and piety in the confidence and esteem which it naturally inspires  While Tom Idle's depravity leads him to become the profli∣gate associate of abject and vicious wretches who prepare his mind for the commission of higher crimes the virtuous incli∣nations of his fellowapprentice Francis Goodchild introduce him to the confidential friendship of his respectable master and lead him onward to opulence and fame He appears in this Print as presiding over the countinghouse and entrusted with the management of the entire business The daybook is in his hands the purse and keys are committed to his care and the amiable familiarity with which his master leans on his shoulder bearing a placid smile on his intelligent countenance demonstrates the entire satisfaction with which he confides in this favourite youth whose aspect and attitude speak equally his evident desert The union of the gloves though laying as by accident are finely figurative of the existing friendship and point to the future partnership of the parties while the emblematical headpiece on the top of the London Almanack ingeniously presents under the form of an ANGEL the Industrious Youth  taking  TIME  by the Forelock  The looms and spinningwheels at work in the back∣ground assist to give an idea of the magnitude of Mr West's trade which is also aided by the approach of the City Porter who enters the warehouse loaded with bales The grotesque physiognomy of this Porter with a Bardolphian nose and the ghastly grin of his fourfooted attendant in momentary dread of the cat who is plainly collecting all her energies in the elevated contour of her back to desend her domestick do∣mains and drive away the unwelcome invader of her conceived rights are admirably depicted and form a pleasing contrast to the amiable simplicity which pervades the rest of the de∣sign  The Scripture Motto for this Print is judiciously chosen  "Well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things"  MATHEW XXV  A CURE FOR VULGAR PREJUDICES AGAINST DRESS  BY MR HARRISON  THE absurd prejudices of the Vulgar are in nothing more conspicuous than in their affected contempt of Dress to which so many thousands of those who are most industriously disposed owe their entire subsistence  In Spitalfields for example a few years ago till every por∣ter's knot began to cover a pigtail when any person of tole∣rable decency happened to pass through one of the many popu∣lous streets of that district with his hair queued he was in∣sulted by myriads of men women and children swarming at the doors and windows with"Look at his tail""Only see there""La what a tail our cat has got""Well I wish I had but a tail"and a hundred such speeches till he happily got into the somewhat more civilized regions of Whitechapel Shoreditch or Bethnal Green where he was only liable to occasional attacks from stragglers the poor thoughtless wretches never once considering that they should perhaps the next day be obliged to quit their habitations and solicit charity from the person they were then insulting for want of that very employ which the fashion they thus rudely dis∣couraged was in some measure calculated to promote with the additional disadvantage of having steeled one who might otherwise have felt for their distres  against Spitalfields weavers in general by the indignities so universally received in  that quarter and which must still be green in his remem∣brance  Chairmen Hackneycoachmen and Watermen have also a large share of this disposition though they all owe much of their support to causes which could not exist without dress the necessary concomitant of visits and parties of pleasure and with respect to the last class of beings in particular it is abso∣lutely impossible at present for any welldressed person to walk on the southern banks of the Thames or on the oppo∣site shore highter than London Bridge without many saluta∣tions in what is emphatically stiled Water Language as pro∣mulged in the neighbouring university of Billingsgate Indeed from that famous seminary abuse is so plentifully disseminated among all the stallkeepers and basketcarriers in our markets and publick streets and their respective connections that it bids fair for becoming what philosophers have long wanted a universal dialect nor can this universality be at all won∣dered at by those who consider that the venders of sprats oysters and other fish in the winterthe season when they take their academical degreesare retailers of strawberries cherries gooseberries cucumbers cabbages and other fruits and vegetables in the summer and that they carry all their original learning vastly improved by practice into every new prosession which is more than can be said of many professors in other arts and sciences  But though the several respectable personages included in the classes just mentioned have powers of speech at least equal to those of any other callings or professions whatever calculated to express their antipa  to what they chuse to consider as something more than s  rsiuous attention to dress there are other tribes nearly as well qualified in these respects from their constant intercourse with those proficients and who have the ad∣ditional advantage of being abundantly better furnished gene∣rally speaking from the nature of their occupations with imple∣ments capable of giving the most convincing proofs of their aver∣sion to any thing like gaiety or even decency in apparel It is true that a basketwoman may knock a lady down o  even a gentleman by running wilfully against them or she may con∣tent herself with only carrying off the headdress of the former or hat and wig of the latter to take their chance in the clean∣liness of the streeta barrowgirl may dispose the handles of her barrow and a chairman his poles so as to throw down any person whose dress gives them offence or at least tear a gown a cloak or the skirt of a coatand a coachman and a waterman most of my readers have probably had frequent opportunities of observing know perfectly well how to splash  in the exercise of their respective vocations any similar of∣fender who happens to be passing by them the one by making his horses suddenly plunge in a full kenned and the other by a dextrous manoeuvre with his oars But these contrivances excellent as they all undoubtedly are and highly to the credit of the several ingenious inventors as well as to the excellent police which encourages by not discouraging such laudable endeavours to increase the consumption of our manufactures are of little or no consequence when compared with the very superior exertions of lamplighters linkboys chimneysweepers scavengers dustmen butchers porters and a variety of others who are armed at all points to burn oil black cover with mud blind bruise and maim so that all genteel persons who never fail to excite their attention may esteem themselves extremely fortunate if they walk in the publick streets for ten minutes without meeting with some accident as it is called either in person or dress  The success of these gentry in what seems to have become a part of their pr  fessions is indeed most astonishingly great and the proofs they so abundantly give seldom fail to m  et with universal approbation from the surrounding spectators who cordially join in the laugh which practices of this kind com∣monly inspire not always considering at whose expence some future mirth of the same kind may chance to be furnished So natural is it for man to enjoy the present without any retro∣spect of the past or much concern about the future  A circumstance however some time since came to my knowledgefor I was unfortunately not a spectator of the transactionwhere a very laudable design of this nature was not taken in such good part as usual by the person on whom the intended favour was conferred To say the truth the gentleman who turned out the hero in the business to which I allude appears to have been rather too conversant in certain arts of the vulgar though few I apprehend will greatly blame his conduct on the present occasion when they have heard the whole story which I shall now endeavour to relate  A gentleman from the Westend of the town who not only approved of putting on clean stockings but who was desirous to preserve them so as much as possible while they were on was one dirty day hastening to his banker's in Cornhill with a very considerable sum in his pockets At the northeast corner of St Paul's Church Yard exactly in the crossing to Cheapside stood a seavenger's cart attended by three or four begrimed myrmidons who had wilfully blocked up the way and waited the approach of a fit object for their mirth The gentleman's white silk stockings and his evident caution in  walking instantly attracted their notice they accordingly set him down as a proper instrument and made the usual dispo∣sition to receive him spreading a large bed of mud across the way and wai  ing his approach with their scoops and besoms while one went forward to the horses that he might either ba  k them or make them spring forward among the filth as occasion served so as to produce the most mischievous effect A single hastly glance of the gentleman's eye however soon in∣formed him what they meant to be at and in order to avoid them he kept to the left intending to cross by the end of Newgateformerly called BlowbladderStreet But the game was in view and they resolved not to lose their sport one of the fellows therefore running round the cart where he had clearly no other business met the gentleman as he passed the top of Paternoster Row and fixed the dirty scoop with so much adroitness that it not only made an ample spot on his stooking but very nearly threw him down It was with the utmost difficulty that the gentleman's spirit enabled him to bear for a moment this insolent attack but he wisely consi∣dered that he had more property about him than he should chuse to lose that he had but a little way to go and that it would be impossible for them to have finished had they been more disposed to work than they evidently were before he should return He therefore hastened on without appearing to regard the universal roar of laughter against him and hav∣ing dispatched his business was back in about twenty minutes at one trunkmaker's the corner of St Paul's froin whence he was about to cross by the other's The fellow who had before met with such success and applause had observed him returning and was resolved to have a stroke at the other stock∣ing He accordingly placed himself at the edge of the pave∣ment with his back towards Cheapside ready to turn round the instant the gentleman should come up with such an appli∣cation of the muddy implement in his hand as could not well fail effectually to do the business Thus stationed his grim features wore the aspect of vast selfcomplacency and those of his companions grinned their approbation The gentleman had expected some similar arrangement and having deter∣mined on the part which it would be proper for him to act took no pains to avoid the assailant but went fairly into his clutches The fellow however had very little time to con∣gratulate himself on the good effect of his stratagem for the gentleman being fully prepared instantly fastened on his collar and with a single blow felled him to the earth The others now came round and with the ulmost liberalityof abuse were about to convince him that four men are more than a  match for one but the temporary stoppage had in the mean time formed a crowd and several persons of genteel appear∣ance being among them the gentleman addressed himself to one in particular and entreated him to deposit his hat coat and watch at the trunkmaker's and to see that he had no foul play as he had determined to fight the blackguard who had insulted him in his own way This proposal gave universal satisfaction for even the aggressor himself little as he relished the specimen he had received from his antagonist entertained no sort of doubt that his own superior strength and skill joined to a pretty extensive practice would soon enable him to repay with interest the blow under which he still smarted and at any rate it was no small honour to box with a gentle∣man while on the contrary any thing like a refusal to ac∣cept such a challenge would brand him with all the infamy of an eternal imputation of cowardice among his companions nor perhaps after all save him from a drubbing fully equal to what he should receive in fair fighting Which of these rea∣sons operated most powerfully or whether all of them acted in concert it is not by any means easy to decide however he lost no time in what beargarden phraseology denominates  pecling  and in a few minutes he was quite  uncased  in more refined language stripped to the skin  The ring was formed and the combatants took their stations The gentleman waited coolly to receive the fellow who ad∣vanced with great fury but the former dextrously avoided a most tremendous blow and at the same instant nimbly dart∣ing forward gave his antagonist a most severe stroke under the ribs which drove him breathless to the ground He rose again and was again treated precisely in the same manner with the addition of a deep cut in his skull received from a large stone on which he this second time fell He was now asked if he had enough and loud were the plaudits of the mob in praise of the gentleman's prowess which all declared they had never seen exceeded The fellow however was by no means satisfied for he had not once struck his antagonist and he confided that a single blow from his powerful arm could not fail to terminate the contest that blow there∣fore he determined in his own mind to give and approached for this purpose with much caution not forgetting to pay par∣ticular attention to the protection of his own ribs which had been twice so severely handled exactly in the same place The gentleman saw what was passing and took his measures accord∣ingly he was round the fellow in a moment and darting a blow from which he instantaneously recoiled hit him exactly between the eyes with a violence which made them both  swell to an enormous size and brought a torrent of blood from his nostrils He was now wild with anguish and disappoint∣ment and though he could hardly standfor the blow had made him stagger though he was kept from quite fallinghe rushed on with prodigious force and fury But extreme pas∣sion had now thrown him quite off his guard and another smart application to his ribs again beat him to the earth from whence he appeared in no condition speedily to arise without assistance Indeed it was for some time doubted that he would ever again recover The gentleman however who had as much humanity as courage desired a surgeon might be sent for before he quitted the spot observing that it was his wish only to cure not to kill the fellow who had want only insulted him The mob felt that the gentleman's heart was good and with their usual attachment to what they think right they idolized his generosity as well as his courage and would almost to a man have now lost their lives in his defence What a pity that minds so well disposed should be ever misled what a pity that they do not always discover what is just Had the gen∣tleman been incapable of at first taking his own part the very same persons might have seen him treated with every indignity and indeed cruelty with the utmost unconcern or even per∣haps with a thoughtless appearance of brutal satisfaction  The poor wretch being at length sufficiently recovered to stand on his legs he begged to shake hands with the gentle∣man and acknowledged he was sorry that he had illtreated a better man than himself The tears gushed from the gen∣tleman's eyes at hearing this manly confession he gave the poor fellow his hand and with it a guinea telling his com∣panions at the same time that they all deserved chastisement but that he hoped they would profit by what they had seen without the experience of a similar fate which must doubtless some time or other attend all who pursue such disgraceful prac∣tices They then severally protested that they were sorry for what they had done and though they evidently did not deserve any reward he generously gave half a crown among them which they declared they would spend in drinking his honour's health and I dare venture to add that they most religiously kept their word  It happened some time after that the same gentle∣manwhose extreme neatness was very apt to give the filthy such offence as his size and appearance were not calculated to prevent them from resenting in their waywas passing down FishStreet Hill when a tall chimneysweeper with his two lads literally brushed by him on each side and soiled his coat most egregiously This was an insult not to be borne he seized  the biggest immediately and complimented him with just such another blow as he had formerly given the scavenger The fel∣low rose pretended the injury was quite accidental and insisted on receiving some satisfaction for the assault A crowd gathered round and the gentleman as before offered the aggressor battle The challenge was accepted and the sweep stripped in what is called  buff  but which did not in this case at least give any great idea of that colour The ring was now formed and the com∣bat was about to commence when a fellow rushed in stripped for the fight swearing heartily that the gentleman should not lessen himself by engaging in such a contest for that he him∣self would fight any man who offended him He gave no time for parley but instantly attacked the chimneysweeper and to it they went thoroughly in earnest In a few mi∣nutes Victory declared herself against the chimneysweeper whose eyes were in a fair way for emulating the colour of his cloth and the gentleman soon recognized in his present cham∣pion the scavenger whom he had a few months before so severely drubbed  "There you dog" cried the exulting victor to the discom∣fited sweep "down on your marrowbones and thank me for your life By the Lord Harry if you had fought with that gentleman you would now have been in the other country for he licked me a little while ago twice as much as I have beat you So you dog I have saved your bacon and you ought at least to give me a guinea"  "Well" cried the gentleman "my old friend you are fairly entitled to the guinea and you shall have it"  He accordingly gave him that sum desiring him to afford the poor devil he had beaten a draught of beer out of it and away the combatants jogged cordially together to the next publickhouse where they related pretty fairly what had happened to the great edification of many of their assembled brethren who have since been considerably more cautious of wantonly giving offence to gentlemen though some of the most mean and dastardly still occasionally gratify the native malevolence of their dispositions by making their dirty attacks on ladies However as no person who deserves the name of a gentleman or indeed of a mancan tamely see any female thus insulted it is hoped that such practices as we become more polished and accomplished will soon totally decline and render unnecessary the administration of a remedy which though rough is not so dangerous as the timid are apt to suppose and which when pro∣perly applied never fails to give at least a temporary relief and seldom to effect a compleat and lasting cure in that strange malady so peculiar to the vulgara loathing of decency in dress  STORY OF A DISABLED VETERAN SUPPOSED TO BE TOLD BY HIMSELF  BY DR GOLDSMITH  AS for my misfortunes master I cannot pretend to have gone through any more than other folks for except the loss of my limb and my being obliged to beg I don't know any reason thank Heaven that I have to complain There is Bill Tibbs of our regiment he has lost  both  his legs and an eye to boot but thank Heaven it is not so bad with me yet I was born in Shropshire my father was a labourer and died when I was five years old so I was put upon the parish As he had been a wandering sort of a man the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged or where I was born so they sent me to another parish and that parish sent me to a third I thought in my heart they kept sending me about so long that they would not let me be born in any pa∣rish at all but at last however they fixed me I had some disposition to be a scholar and was resolved at least to know my letters but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet and here I lived an easy kind of life for five years I only wrought ten hours in the day and bad my meat and drink provided for my labour It is true I was not suffered to stir out of the house for fear as they said I should run away But what of that I had the liberty of the whole house and the yard before the door and that was enough for me I was then bound out to a farmer where I was up both early and late but I eat and drank well and liked my business well enough till he died when I was obliged to provide for myself so I was resolved to go and seek my fortune In this manner I went from town to town worked when I could get employment and starved when I could get none when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace I spied a hare crossing the path just before me and I believe the devil put it into my head to fling my stick at it Well what will you have on't I killed the hare and was bringing it away in triumph when the justice himself met me He called me a poacher and a villain and collaring me desired I would give an account of myself I fell on my knees begged his worship's pardon and began to give a full account of all I knew of my breed seed and gene∣ration but though I gave a very good account the justice would not believe a syllable I had to say so I was indicted at the sessions found guilty of being poor and sent up to Lon∣don to Newgate in order to be transported as a vagabond  People may say this and that of being in jail but for my part I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in in all my life I had my bellyfull to eat and drink and did no work at all This kind of life was too good to last for ever so I was taken out of prison after five months put on board a ship and sent off to the plantations We had but an indifferent passage for being all confined in the hold more than a hundred died for want of sweet air and those that re∣mained were sickly enough God knows When we came ashore we were sold to the planters and I was bound for seven years more As I was no scholarfor I did not know my lettersI was obliged to work among the negroes and I served out my time as in duty bound to do When my time was expired I worked my passage home and glad I was to see Old England againbecause I loved my country I was afraid however that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more so did not much care to go down into the country but kept about the town and did little jobs when I could get them I was very happy in this manner for some time till one even∣ing coming home from work two men knocked me down and then desired me to stand They belonged to a pressgang I was carried before the justice and as I could give no account of myself I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war or list for a soldier I chose the latter and in this post of a gentleman I served two campaigns in Flanders was at the battles of Val and Fontenoy and received but one wound through the breast here but the doctor of our regiment soon made me well again When the peace came on I was dis∣charged and as I could not work because my wound was sometimes troublesome I listed for a landman in the East India Company's service I here fought the French in six pitched battles and I verily believe that if I could read or write our captain would have made me a corporal But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion for I soon fell sick and so got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket This was at the beginning of the late war and I hoped to be set on shore and to have the pleasure of spending my money but the government wanted men and so I was pressed for a sailor before ever I could set a foot on shore The boatswain found me as he said an obstinate fellow He swore that he knew that I understood my business well but that I  hammed Abram merely to be idle but God knows I knew nothing of sea business and he beat me without considering what he was about I had still however my forty pounds and that was some comfort to me under every beating and the money I might have had to this day but that our ship was taken by the French and so I lost all Our crew was carried  into Brest and many of them died because they were not used to live in a jail but for my part it was nothing to me for I was seasoned One night as I was sleeping on the bed of boards with a warm blanket about mefor I always love to lie well I was awakened by the boatswain who had a darklanthorn in his hand "Jack" say he to me "will you knock out the French sentries brains""I don't care" says I striving to keep myself awake "it I lend a hand""Then follow me" says he and I hope we shall do their business" So up I got and tied my blanket which was all the cloaths I had about my middle and went with him to fight the Frenchmen I hate the French because they are all slaves and wear wooden∣shoes Though we had no arms one Englishman is able to beat five French at any time so we went down to the door where both sentries were posted and rushing upon them seized their arms in a moment and knocked them down From thence nine of us ran together to the quay and seizing the first boat we met got safe out of the harbour and put to sea We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dorset privateer who were glad of so many good hands and we consented to run our chance In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer of forty guns while we had but twentythree so to it we went yardarm and yardarm The fight lasted for three hours and I verily believe we should have taken the Frenchman had we but had some more men left behind but unfortunately we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory I was once more in the power of the French and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Brest but by good for∣tune we were retaken by the Viper I had almost forgot to tell you that in that engagement I was wounded in two places I lost four fingers of the lefthand and my leg was shot off If I had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and the use of my hand on board a king's ship and not on board a privateer I should have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the rest of my life but that was not my chance One man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and another with a woodenladle However blessed be God I enjoy good health and will for ever love Liberty and Old England Liberty Property and Old England for ever  GRADATION FROM A GREENHORN TO A BLOOD EXTRACTED FROM THE ADVENTURER  THOUGH the characters of men have perhaps been essentially the same in all ages yet their external ap∣pearance  has changed with other peculiarities of time and place and they have been distinguished by different names as new modes of expression have prevailed a periodical writer there∣fore who catches the picture of evanescent life and shews the deformity of follies which in a few years will be so changed as not to be known should be careful to express the character when he describes the appearance and to connect it with the name by which it then happens to be called You have fre∣quently used the terms Buck and Blood and have given some account of the characters which are thus denominated but you have not considered them as the last stages of a regular progression nor taken any notice of those which precede them Their dependence upon each other is indeed so little known that many suppose them to be distinct and collateral classes formed by persons of opposite interests tastes capacities and dispositions the scale however consists of eight degrees Greenhorn Jemmy Jessamy Smart Honest Fellow Joyous Spirit Buck and Blood As I have myself passed through the whole series I shall explain each station by a short account of my life remarking the periods when my character changed it's denomination and the particular incidents by which the change was produced  My father was a wealthy farmer in Yorkshire and when I was near eighteen years of age he brought me to London and put me apprentice to a considerable shopkeeper in the city There was an aukward modest simplicity in my manner and a reverence of religion and virtue in my conversation The novelty of the scene that was now placed before me in which there were innumerable objects that I never conceived to exist rendered me attentive and credulous peculiarities which without a provincial accent a slouch in my gait a long lank head of hair and an unfashionable suit of drabcoloured cloth would have denominated me a Greenhorn or in other words a country put very green  Green then I continued even in externals near two years and in this state I was the object of universal contempt and de∣rision but being at length wearied with merriment and insult I was very sedulous to assume the manners and appearance of those who in the same station were better treated I had already improved greatly in my speech and my father having allowed me thirty pounds a year for apparel and pocket∣money the greater part of which I had saved I bespoke a suit of cloaths of an eminent citytaylor with several waistcoats and breeches and two frocks for a change I cut off my hair and procured a brown bob periwig of Wilding just of the same colour with a single row of curls round the bottom which I  wore very nicely combed and without powder my hat which had been cocked with great exactness in an equilateral triangle I discarded and purchased one of a more fashionable size the sore corner of which projected near two inches father than those on each side and was moulded into the shape of a spout I also furnished myself with a change of whitethread stockings took care that my pumps were varnished every morning with the new German blackingball and when I went out carried in my hand a little switch which as it had been long append  nt to the character that I had just assumed has taken the same name and is called a Jemmy  I soon perceived the advantage of this transformation My manner had not indeed kept pace with my dress I was still modest and diffident temperate and sober and consequently still subject to ridicule but I was now admitted into com∣pany from which I had before been excluded by the rusticity of my appearance I was raillied and encouraged by turns and I was instructed both by precept and example Some of∣fers were made of carrying me to a house of private entertain∣ment which then I absolutely refused but I soon found the way into the playhouse to see the two last acts and the farce here I learned that by breaches of chastity no man was thought to incur either guilt or shame but that on the contrary they were essentially necessary to the character of a fine gentleman I soon copied the original which I found to be universally ad∣mired in my morals and made some farther approaches to it in my dress I suffered my hair to grow long enough to comb back over the foretop of my wig which when I sallied forth to my evening amusement I changed to a queue I tied the collar of my shirt with half an ell of black ribband which ap∣peared under my neckcloth the forecorner of my hat was considerably elevated and shortened so that it no longer re∣sembled a spout but the corner of a minced pye my waistcoat was edged with a narrow lace my stockings were silk and I never appeared without a pair of clean gloves My address from it's native masculine plainness was converted to an excess of softness and civility especially when I spoke to the ladies I had before made some progress in learning to swear I had proceeded by fegs faith pox plague 'pon my life 'pon my soul rat it and zookers to zanns and the devil I now ad∣vanced to by Jove 'fore ged ged's curse it and demme but I still uttered these interjections in a tremulous tone and my pronounciation was feminine and vicious I was sensible of my defects and therefore applied with great diligence to re∣move them I frequently practised alone but it was a long time before I could swear so much to my own satisfaction in  company as by myself My labour however was not with∣out it's reward it recommended me to the notice of the la∣dies and procured me the gentle appellation of Jessamy  I now learned among other Grown Gentlemen to dance which greatly enlarged my acquaintance I entered into a subscription for countrydances once a week at a tavern where each gentleman engaged to bring a partner at the same time I made considerable advances in swearing I could pronounce damme with a tolerable air and accent give the vowel it's full sound and look with confidence in the face of the person to whom I spoke About this time my father's eldest brother died and left me an estate of near five hundred pounds per an∣num I now bought out the remainder of my time and this sudden accession of wealth and independence gave me immedi∣ately an air of greater confidence and freedom I laid out near one hundred and fifty pounds in cloaths though I was obliged to go into mourning I employed a courttaylor to make them up I exchanged my queue for a bag I put on a sword which in appearance at least was a Toledo and in proportion as I knew my dress to be elegant I was less solici∣tous to be neat My acquaintance now increased every hour I was attended flattered and caressed was often invited to entertainments fupped every night at a tavern and went home in a chair was taken notice of in publick places and was universally confessed to be improved into a Smart  There were some intervals in which I found it necessary to abstain from wenching and in these at whatever risque I applied myself to the bottle a habit of drinking came insensibly upon me and I was soon able to walk home with a bottle and a pint I had learned a sufficient number of fashionable toasts and had got by heart several toping and several bawdy songs some of which I ventured to roar out with a friend hanging on my arm as we scoured the street after our nocturnal revel I now laboured with indefatigable industry to increase those ac∣quisitions I enlarged my stock of healths made great pro∣gress in singing joking and storytelling swore well could make a company of staunch topers drunk always collected the reckoning and was the last man that departed My face began to be covered with red pimples and my eyes to be weak I became daily more negligent of my dress and more blunt in my manner I professed myself a foe to starters and milksops declared that there was no enjoyment equal to that of a bottle and a friend and soon gained the apellation of an Honest Fellow  By this distinction I was animated to attempt yet greater excellence I learned several feats of mimickry of the under  players could take off known characters tell a staring story and humbug with so much skill as sometimes to takein a knowing one I was so successful in the practice of these arts to which indeed I applied myself with unwearied diligence and assiduity that I kept my company roaring with applause till their voices sunk by degrees and they were no longer able either to hear or to see I had now ascended another scale in the climax and was acknowledged by all who knew me to be a Joyous Spirit  After all these topicks of merriment were exhausted and I had repeated my tricks my stories my jokes and my songs till they grew insipid I became mischievous and was continu∣ally devising and executing Frolicks to the unspeakable delight of my companions and the injury of others For many of them I was prosecuted and frequently obliged to pay large damages but I bore all these loses with an air of jovial indif∣ference I pushed on in my career I was more desperate in proportion as I had less to lose and being deterred from no mischief by the dread of it's consequences I was said to run at all and was complimented by the name of a Buck  My estate was at length mortgaged for more than it was worth creditors were importunate I became neglectful of my∣self and others I made a desperate effort at the gamingtable and lost the last sum that I could raise my estate was seized by the mortgagee I learned to pack cards and to cog a die became a bully to whores passed my nights in a brothel the street or the watchhouse was utterly in sensible of shame and lived upon the town as a beast of prey in a forest Thus I reached the summit of modern glory and had just acquired the character of a blood when I was arrested for an old debt of three hundred pounds and thrown into the King's Bench Prison  These characters Sir though they are distinct yet do not at all differ otherwise than as shades of the same colour and though they are stages of a regular progression yet the whole progress is not made by every individual some are so soon initi∣ated in the mysteries of the town that they are never publickly known in their Greenhorn state others six long in the Jem∣myhood others are Jessamys at fourscore and some stagnate in each of the higher stages for life But I request that they may never hereafter be confounded either by you or your cor∣respondents Of the Blood your brother adventurer Mr Wildgoose though he assumes the character does not seem to have a just and precise idea as distinct from the Buck in which class he should be placed and will probably die for he seems determined to shoot himself just at the time when  his circumstances will enable him to assume the higher dis∣tinctions  But the retrospect upon life which this letter has made ne∣cessary covers me with confusion and aggravates despair I cannot but reflect that among all these characters I have never assumed that of a Man Man is a Reasonable Being which he ceases to be who disguises his body with ridiculous fopperies or degrades his mind by detestable brutality These thoughts would have been of great use to me if they had occur∣red seven years ago If they are of use to you I hope you will send me a small gratuity for my labour to alleviate the misery of hunger and nakedness but dear Sir let your bounty be speedy lest I perish before it arrive  I am your humble Servant KING'S BENCH COMMONSIDE NOMENTANUS  A RECRUITING SERJEANT'S SPEECH  GOOD PEOPLE  YOU have heard my drum and now it is

to the bar sent for the perukemaker to measure him for a new tyewig The peruquier on applying his apparatus in one direction was observed to smile On which the young barrister desiring to know what ludicrous circumstance gave rise to his mirth the barber replied that he could not ba  re∣mark the extreme length of his honour's head"That's well" said the student "we lawyers have occasion for long heads" The barber who had by this time compleated the dimensions now burst out into a sit of laughter and an ex∣planation being insisted on at last declared that he could not possibly contain himself when he discovered that his honour's head was just as thick as it was long  ANECDOTE OF STERNE AND THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE  THE Duke of Newcastle being one day engaged in con∣versation with the late witty author of Tristram Shandy and observing that men of genius were unfit to be employed being generally incapable of business the wit sarcastically replied" They are not incapable my lord duke but above it a sprightly generous horse is able to carry a packsaddle as well as an ass but he is too good to be put to the drudgery"  ANECDOTE OF MR FOX AND A WESTMINSTER ELECTOR  MR Fox on his first canvas for Westminster having accosted a tradesman whom he solicited for his vote the blunt elector replied" I cannot give you my support I admire your abilities but dn your principles" Mr Fox instantly retorted" My friend I applaud your since∣rity but dn your manners"  MARGARET TIMBERTOE AND PHELIM O'GIMBLET AN IRISH PASTORAL BALLAD IN FOUR PARTS  ARGUMENT  A certain shepherdess yeleped Margaret Timbertoe had the misfortune to be born without the sense of hearing and was consequently dumb she had likewise by accident lost the use of one leg and one eye in other respects she was not without some very powerful attractions at least in the eye of a neighbouring shepherdby name Phelim O'Gimoletwho being in the same situation as to the two latter particulars became enamoured of the nymph and thus he spake his passion  ADMIRATION  DEVIL burn 'em these wits are jackasses  Tumble down their vile books from my shelves  They goddesses make of their lasses  And simpletons make of themselves  Away with their nonsenseaway  Moggy Timbertoe let me indite  Whose eye is as bright as the day  And whose tongue is as still as the night  With storms should the elements crack  How fearless is Virtue the while  Let the brave be dismay'd at the smack  Her face wears an evergreen smile  So gracefully Phillida moves  So lightly she trips o'er the ground  Each shepherd that looks at her loves  Each shepherdess envies the wound  But how would the blunderers stare  To see little Timbertoe run  Or how would Miss Phillida bear  To foot it for ever on one  I knew that her fortune was noble  I was smit with her presence behind  And bless'd with a similar hobble  I worte her a piece of my mind  "I've seen a complexion as fair  Jenny Twinkle has one eye as fine  But where shall we meet with a pair  So bright as that twinkler of thine  "My passion in vain I would stifle  Like a cinder I'm burnt black and blue  Nor can I be cur'd by a trifle  Unless I've that trifle from you  "We have two pretty legs here between us  And a very compleat pair of eyes  The folks that on one side have seen us  Have seen nothing there to despise  "It is not your cottage I want  'Gainst an old oak's body reclin'd  With a widegaping window in front  And a snug little peephole behind  "It is not the smell of your kitchen  Where plenty and cleanliness please  With a whole ham and half of a flitch in  Reserve for potatoes and peas  "It is not your mare to ride double  Berest like ourselves of one eye  No nor twenty far geese in the stubble  Nor a sow with nine pigs in the stye  "It is not dear Moggy your purse  But your person I Phelim adore  And I'll take you for better for worse  Will any man take you for more"  HOPE  KIND Nature had thrown off the load  Which in winter she commonly bore  And the sun jogg'd along the same road  He had travelled some thousand times o'er  Mother Earth had put on her new cloaths  'Twas in English the sweet month of May  When Love led me forth by the nose  Where dear Moggy Timbertoe lay  On the marge of a river reclin'd  I trembled to see her asleep  Left she wake on the side that was blind  And roll adown into the deep  Young Zephyr play'd roguishly by  And whistled quite up to her knee  I respectfully shut my one eye  And the devil a bit did I see  Thrice I roar'd out"Arise pretty maid"  But she could not have heard the last trump  Yet thrice to get up she essay'd  And thrice she fell down again plump  Then quick to assist her I went  She was pleas'd my affection to see  Her single eye shone with content  And doubly it shone upon me  She drew from her bosom my letter  Love drew from his quiver a dart  "Ah" thought I "she can't have a better  To trip up the heels of her heart"  She smil'd when I kiss'd her dear hand  "Do your pleasure" as much as to say  Yet so sweetly the bids me command  By my faith that she makes me obey  Oh what pleasure to see her lips jabber  About something that nobody knows  And their taste is just like bonnyclabber  While 'tatoes bob up to one's nose  Ye scenes of nonsensical noise  Where often with pleasure I strove  I fly from your bumpkinly joys  To the bosom of beauty and love  No Longer the cudgel I wield  The glories of wrestling I shun  Ye shepherds the cock of the field  Is content with the fame he has won  Gentle Hope like an owl on her nest  Stretch over my soul thy soft wing  And the raptures that can't be express'd  Get up little Gimblet and sing  DISAPPOINTMENT  YE clouds of a dirtcolour'd dye  Besmut the bright face of the sun  And let not the moon's silver eye  Make game of a lover undone  Brown brown be the earth and ye floods  Tumble back your rude streams or lie still  Ye beasts of the field to the woods  Ye feather'd fowls fly where you will  Plague take it this love's a vile passion  'Tis not worth an honest man's care  It begins with a world of vexation  It ends in disgust and despair  These girls are so full of vagary  One never knows when one is right  They'll lead you a dance till you're weary  Then marry another in spite  I pity those poor honest fellows  Tied fast to their aprons for life  They first give them cause to be jealous  Then" Dare you suspect your own wise"  I thought I'd secur'd my dear Moggy  As safe as a thies in a mill  But I'm popt in a hole that is boggy  And there I may lie if I will  I found out a gift for my lass  I found out the maker at York  'Twas an eye neatly fashion'd of glass  'Twas a leg nicely finish'd of cork  "Special good are the members I bring"  Said I and to please her the more  "My dear you will find 'em the thing  For I've tried and I've proved them before  "Look here my sweet creature to grace  How charming this eyeball doth shine  It will give a new bloom to your face  See it's fellow illuminates mine  "Here's a limb your acceptance I beg  Oh 'tis better than that log of wood  'Tis a brother to this little peg"  And I caper'd as high as I could  How false are the pleasures we know  How severe is the pang of disgrace  When I offer'd them both and bow'd low  Why she gave me a kick in the face  Disappointment so blinded my eye  So confus'd the fine things I'd to say  That my path I could hardly espy  As in dudgeon I hobbled away  SUCCESS  THERE be lovers of life so profuse  If a mistress but happens to frown  That will give their wise heads to a noose  Or take to the water and drown  Now why should we quarrel with life  Since life is at best but a span  Is the loss of a termagant wife  Such a horrid misfortune to man  A termagant wife is the dee'l  And can Moggy a termagant prove  Her foot to be sure made me reel  But perhaps 'twas a proof of her love  "Ah Phelim" said I to myself  "Why will not thy vanity see  That a lady possess'd of such pelf  May buy a much better than thee"  Then I call'd myself dastardly devil  And thought upon all I'd been told  How that beauty despises a snivel  And yields to the touch of the bold  He's a knave and a noddy to boot  That's abash'd when a maiden says Nay  And hastily gives up his suit  Because he can't have his own way  I knew that the gists would allure  And I follow'd the issue to see  But scarce had I gone from the door  Little Moggy came hopping to me  On her lips I imprinted a kiss  And another intended but oh  She caught such a soretaste of bliss  That she quak'd from her top to her too  I fear'd that an ague had seiz'd her  Her colour so went and so came  But soon I perceiv'd that it pleas'd her  And pleas'd I repeated the same  Toward church I observ'd her eye squint  Certain proof that she meant to be kind  So I quickly improv'd on the hint  And I silently told her my mind  But when her compliance I guess'd  I thought that my heart would run wild  By St Patrick it bump'd in my breast  Like the kicks of a neverborn child  To the parson I artfully stray'd  Who knew our perfections to scan  He vow'd so accomplish'd a maid  Never wedded so finish'd a man  He declar'd we were form'd for delight  Thoughto give honest Levi his due  Time and stingo so bother'd his sight  That he scarce knew a P from a Q  He bless'd us again and again  In hopes I would double his pay  But before the clerk snuffled Amen  We hopp'd like two magpies away  A FRAGMENT OF CHAUCER  RIGHT wele of lerned clerkis is it sed  That womenhud for manis' use is made  But naughty man liketh not one or so  He lusteth aye unthriftily for mo  And whom he whilome cherished when tied  By holy church he cannot her abide  Like unto dog which lighteth of a bone  His tail he waggeth glad thereof ygrown  But thilke same bone if to his tail thou tye  Pardie he fearing it away doth fly  THE PEASANT'S SIMILE FOR CUCKOLDOM  THOSE folksquoth Hodgemen cuckolds call  Three beasts will represent them all  See yonder in that plat of grass  My shaggy Goat my Kam my Ass  Old greybeard bears behind his horns  And the reproach he sees not scorns  Giddy in vain from scandal flies  His horns hang ever in his eyes  But Jack the greatest wretch appears  Who takes for horns his lopping ears  THE POET'S RETORT  BY SIR JOHN RAMSEA  "I'VE seen your verses" Smatter cries  "And duller stuff I never read"  "Are you quite sure" the bard replies  "No fault was in my reader's head"  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS PLATE V  The Idle 'Prentice turn'd away and sent to Sea  THE COMICK MAGAZINE  NUMBER V  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE V THE IDLE 'PRENTICE TURNED AWAY AND SENT TO SEA  THE good Mr West wearied with the vain expectation of seeing any amendment in his vicious apprentice Thomas Idle and finding on the contrary that he grew still worse and worse as a last effort to save the youth from total destruction by dividing him from his profligate companions he procured him to be sent on board a man of war The dis∣cipline of the navy he well knew must in some measure cor∣rect indolent habits and he hoped that the youth might yet be made a useful member of society This print accordingly pre∣sents our unpromising hero in the ship's boat accompanied by his mourning mother whose dress denotes her widowhood and gives rise to the reflection that she is thus resigning her last hope the once fondly cherished solace and support of her de∣clining years  In the mean time while the waterman is rowing coolly along and smoking the pipe of indifference with all a Dutch∣man's frigidity one man in the boat sarcastically points to a pirate hanging in chains on a gibbet as an emblem of Tom's future destiny and the other with an elevated cato'ninetails displayed in a menacing way to the culprit bespeaks the pre∣vious chastisement he may expect at sea These hints he receives without emotion and to evince his equal talent for raillery displays two fingers held up as horns and calls the married man's attention to Cuckold's Point which at that in∣stant  appears in view where those symbols "unpleasing to a married eye" salute every spectator Amidst the ridicule of his present companions and wholly unmoved by the distress of his mother Tom Idle has thrown away his forfeited indenture which is seen floating on the waves and speaks most forcibly his disdain of i  's salutary restraints  The celebrated Lavater in his Essays on Physionomy where he has introduced this excellent Print emphatically ex∣claims "Can perverseness be more manifest than in the mid∣dle profile"  All the characters in fact are forcibly expressed and the scenery is well selected The roughness of the water with the gibbet windmills c descriptive of the Thames give birth to ideas in unison with the subject  The sacred motto is literally just  "A foolish son is the heaviness of his mother"  PROV X Y  SERMON ON THE WORD MALT PREACHED BY THE REV MR DODD IN A HOLLOW TREE  THE Rev Mr Dodd a very worthy minister who lived a few miles from Cambridge had rendered himself ob∣noxious to many of the Cantabs by frequently preaching against drunkenness several of whom meeting him on a jour∣ney they determined to make him preach in a hollow tree which was near the roadside Accordingly addressing him with great apparent politeness they asked him if he had not lately preached much against drunkenness On his replying in the affirmative they insisted that he should now preach from a text of their chusing In vain did he remonstrate on the un∣reasonableness of expecting him to give them a discourse with∣out study and in such a place they were determined to take no denial and the word MALT was given him by way of text on which he immediately delivered himself as follows  "BELOVED let me crave your attentionI am a little man come at a short warning to preach a short sermon from a small subject in an unworthy pulpit to a small congregation Beloved my text is MALT I cannot divide it into words it being but one nor into syllables it being

profited more by this short and whimsical sermon than by any serious discourse they had ever heard  PROPOSED HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED AUTHORS  I Sit down to write in behalf of a set of gentlemen in this town called Authors whose appearance in publick for many prudent reasons being seldom and their habitations far above the common level with the rest of mankind they pass unnoticed by the generality of the world and are looked upon by others as a name without a being  From whence this want of respect for so considerable a body of men proceeds I will not take upon me to say but certain it is that many worthy wits by profession are starving in gar∣rets while the gravitation of dulness daily brings hundreds to and from the Exchange and the neighbouring alleys in their chariots  What a sad reflection it is that the most beautiful ode in Horace will not raise sixpence in the city when an ordinary  knowledge of the multiplicationtable will accumulate estates I This unaccountable humour in the nation of preferring the writings of the Bank directors to those of the sons of Parnassus has reduced many a fine poetical genius to darn his own stock∣ings  A friend of mine who accidentally became acquainted with two or three of these great men who nobly defy poverty for the sake of exhibiting their extraordinary talents took me one day to visit them in their occupation We were led by the master of the house where they lodged a bookseller by trade up a very handsome pair of stairs where I imagined we should have been introduced to the literati on the first floor but how great was my surprize to be conducted up two or three stories more and then up a ladder into a cockloft where eight or nine of these illustrious spirits were amusing themselves with compositions of various sorts not as our guide seemed to insinuate for the lucre of porter and pudding but from the noble motive of benefiting mankind by their lucubrations I must own their unsuitable situation made me feel some concern for them though they seemed to have very little for themselves But my attention to their deplorable circumstances was inter∣rupted by a mistake that my ignorance of their trade led me into for after the first introductory salutations were over they fell again to their former employments without taking any farther notice of us and as I was very attentive out of curiosity I heard one of them call softly across the table to an∣other who sat opposite to him"Pr'ythee Matt Prior lend me thy simile of the bird'snest"  On my expressing some surprize at the name of Matt Prior my friend whispered me that every one of the gentlemen per∣sonated some poet of note and imitated as well as they were able his stile and that such compositions were published under the titles of Remains Posthumous Works c I can∣not say but my indignation began to be kindled at a proceed∣ing so injurious to the deceased had not an object of a different nature excited my laughter for while these deputy harmonists were coupling their rhimes together an old woman of a ve∣nerable aspect mounted the ladder and informed the company that the milkporridge was ready the pens were instantly sluck behind their ears the ink remained in peace and the sound of beams purling streams loves doves and groves was heard no more  I imagined as soon as the visit was over that my acquaint∣ance with these sons of the Muses would be so too but I very soon after found my error for as I was walking in St James's Park the next Sunday I observed three gentlemen in rusty phi∣losophical  black coats brasshilted swords and tyewigs rising up from one of the benches to meet me When they were come a little nearer I perceived one of them to be my old friend the similelender the worthy representative of Matt Prior who accosted me with the most obliging condescension  As our conversation during my stay in the Park was pretty long I shall not trouble you with a particular account of it any farther than to acquaint you that it began with animad∣verting on the damned taste of the town as they called it and concluded with their borrowing half a crown apiece of me Such is the condition of many a great soul in this kingdom who magnanimously scorning to engross to pound in a mor∣tar or live like any other vile mechanick has rather chose to confine himself six days in seven feeling the inward call of a poetical spirit than breathe the same air with the illiterate mul∣titude As many hundreds therefore are led into great in∣conveniences not by their own faults but by this writing devil that possesses them I think it would be a charity altogether worthy of the present publick spirit to found an hospital for necessitous authors such I mean as are not quite furious for those of course will be admitted into that founded by the late Dean of St Patrick's for lunaticks and as no scheme of this sort has hitherto been laid before the publick I beg leave to insert the following in your Miseellany  The first thing to be considered is a proper spot to build an hospital on for which I think Tothill Fields would be very convenient as they lie contiguous to the banks of the fertile Thames whose streams have been the subject of so many fine compositions and may serve to recal even in old age the ideas of their former rapture The structure should be of the old Gothick collegiate architecture containing about two hun∣dred apartments not regular and uniform but of different sizes c according to the different geniuses and dispositions of those that are to be admitted  In this point too the situation of the chambers ought to be observed for instance the compilers of vademecums abridgementmakers c should be stationed in the cellars underground the odewriters next to the skylight the translators on the groundfloor and the epick and dramatick authors on the first and second stories In the midst of the whole I would have a large hall where the whole society should meet three times a day to be provided at every meal with dishes adapted to their constitutions for care must be had that the gentlemen who soar "above the visible diurnal sphere" do not eat of beef or any other meat that is subject to clog the intellects but be fed as Pindar and the bards of old were with food that elates and puts the fancy on the wing  This college should be governed by a president and twelve directors all of whom should have been booksellers in London for the space of seven years before the time they are elected such that they may be thereby qualified to judge properly of the pretensions of the candidates to this charity Every can∣didate must have the recommendation of one or more of the di∣rectors and a certificate under the hands and seals of four of the company of Stationers that he has been muserid for ten years in such a manner as to be entirely incapacitated for any other vocation in life If these things seem clear the person shall be admitted without farther trouble except he is proved to be worth money for a rich man must be as incapable to enter this hospital "as the kingdom of heaven"  We next come to the choice of proper servants and attend∣ants Now as there are in the three kingdoms innumerable footmen and chambermaids who spend best part of their time with Lee and Otway and daily condemn Fate for having placed people of their uncommon talents in such a situation as to be subject to be called every moment from the heroick com∣pany of Alexander and Roxana and sent to converse much against their inclination with the dregs of the people I would have such as are disposed to live retired and to have frequent opportunities of conversing not only with dead poets but living wits come and offer their service to the hospital where they shall be furnished with every thing necessary for life and be allowed after the little labour that shall be required of them is over stated hours for their favourite studies  When these things are all settled and a handsome subscrip∣tion is opened the legislature no doubt will give encourage∣ment to so noble useful and charitable a foundation by esta∣blishing the lands and funds raised for it's support by parlia∣mentary authority and if it would not be looked on as pre∣sumption to give a hint to so wise and august an assembly a tax might be laid which would bring in vast sums annually and at the same time be no burden to the industrious subject but tend on the contrary to promote every branch of trade in the nation  The tax I mean should be laid on that unprofitable commo∣dity which abounds so much in these kingdoms commonly called Scribbling There should be in every parish an inspec∣tor into this manufactorythe parson for instancewho should take his rounds once a week like the exciseman to vi∣sit those who are dealers and receive the limited duty and in order to obviate any fraud very large penalties might be laid on all such as should clandestinely make verse or prose or a mixture of both which I think is most in request at present  without previously acquainting the ecclesiastical officer or at least informing him immediately after This expence would hinder many an attorney's clerk and apprentice from Philising away his time and keep him from being reduced at last to the hospital  Should it be objected by the proprietors of other periodical miscellanies that such tax would deprive them of many inge∣nious performances both in verse and prose the grievances may be redressed by applying to the directors and compound∣ing with them at so much a year for all their authors in a lump as those people do with commissioners of turnpikes who live near the gate  Having thrown together these loose thoughts I leave the publick to improve my project and shall be happy to subscribe my mite for the establishment of so necessary an institution  THE CHOICE SPIRIT  THAT a tradesman has no business with humour unless perhaps in the way of his dealing or with writing un∣less in his shopbook is a truth which I believe nobody will dispute with me I am so unfortunate however as to have a nephew who not contented with being a grocer is in dan∣ger of absolute ruin by his ambition of being a Wit and hav∣ing forsaken his counter for  Comus's Court  and dignified him∣self with the appellation of a  Choice Spirit  is on the point of becoming a bankrupt Instead of distributing his shop∣bills as he ought he wa  tes a dozen in the morning by scrib∣bling shreds of his nonsense on the backs of them and a few days since affronted an alderman his best customer by send∣ing him a pound of prunes wrapped up in a ballad he had just written called  The Citizen outwitted or a Bob for the Man∣sionhouse  He is likewise a regular frequenter of the playhouses and being acquainted with every underling of each theatre is at an annual expence of ten pounds in tickets for their re∣spective benefits They generally adjourn together from the play to the tavern and there is hardly a watchman within a mile of Covent Garden but has had his head or his lantern broke by one or other of the ingenious fraternity  I turned into his shop this morning and had no sooner set my foot on the threshold than he leaped over the counter threw himself into an attitude as he calls it and asked me in the words of some play that I remember to have seen formerly whether I was  a spirit of health or a goblin damn'd  I told him he was an undutiful young dog for daring to accost his  uncle in that irreverent manner and bade him speak like a Christian and a reasonable person Instead of being sensible of my rebuke he took off his wig and having very delibe∣rately given it two or three twirls on his fist and pitching it on his head again said I was a dry old quiz and should cer∣tainly afford them much entertainment at the club to which he had the impudence to invite me at the same time he thrust a card into my hand containing a bill of fare for the evening's entertainment and as a farther inducement assured me that Mr Twister himself would be in the chair that he was a wonderful creature and so prodigiously droll that though he had heard him sing the same songs and repeat the same stories a thousand times he could still attend to him with as much pleasure as at first I cast my eye over the list and can re∣collect the following items  "To all true Lovers of Fun and Jocularity  "Mr Twister will this evening take off a cat worried by two bulldogs ditto making love in a gutter the knifegrinder and his wheel HighDutch squabble and a hog in a slaughterhouse"  I assured him that so far from having any relish for these detestable noises the more they resembled the originals the less I should like them and if I could ever be fool enough to go should at least be wise enough to stop my ears till I came out again  Having lamented my deplorable want of taste by the eleva∣tion of his eyebrows and a significant shrug of his shoulders he thrust his forefinger against the inside of his cheek and plucking it out of his mouth with a jerk made a noise that very much resembled the drawing of a cork I found that by this signal he meant to ask me if I chose a whet I gave my consent by a sulky kind of nod and walked into the back room as much ashamed of my nephew as he ought to have been of himself While he was gone to fetch a pint of Moun∣tain from the other side of the street I had an opportunity to minute down a few of the articles of which the litter of his apartment consisted and have selected these as the most material from among them  On one of the sconces by the chimney a smart grizzle bob∣wig well oiled and powdered feather topped and bagfronted  On the opposite sconce a scratch  On the windowseat a Nankin waistcoat bound with silvertwist  without skirts or pockets stained with red wine and pretty much shrunk  Item  A pair of buckskin breeches in one pocket a catcall in the other the mouth of a quartbottle chipped and ground into a smooth ring very fit to be used as a spyingglass by those who never want one  Item  A red plush frock lappelled with ditto one pocket stuffed with orangepeel and the other with square bits of white paper ready cut and dried for a shower  In the corner a walkingstaff about eighteen inches long  Item  A small switch  On the head of the bureau a lettercase containing a play∣bill and a quackbill a copy of verses being an enco∣mium on Mr Twister another of four lines which he calls a distich and a third very much blotted and scratch∣ed and yet not finished entitled  An Extempore Epigram  Having taken this inventory of his goods and furniture I sat down before the fire to devise if possible some expedient to reclaim him when on a sudden a sound like the braying of an ass at my elbow alarmed me to such a degree that I started from my seat in an instant and to my farther astonish¦ment beheld my nephew almost black in the face covering his eat with the hollow of his hand and exerting the whole force of his lungs in imitating that respectable animal I was so exasperated at this fresh instance of his folly that I told him hastily he might drink his wine alone and that I would never see his face again till he should think proper to appear in a character worthy himself and family He followed me to the door without making any reply and having advanced into the middle of the street  ell to clapping his sides and crowing like a cock with the utmost vehemence and continued his tri∣umphant ejaculations till I was fairly out of hearing  Having reached my lodgings I immediately resolved to send you an account of his absurdities and shall take this oppor∣tunity to inform him that as he is blessed with such a variety of useful talents and so compleatly accomplished as a  Choice Spirit  I shall not do him the injury to consider him as a trades∣man or mortify him hereafter by endeavouring to give him any assistance in his business  CURIOUS CLAIM OF KINDRED  A Portley and welldressed man lately walking along the Strand suddenly dropped down in an apoplectic fit and though no less a man than his Majesty's Phy  ician in ordinary was coming by at the time and was willing to give every as∣sistance  the Materia Medica could afford it was all in vain the body was dead beyond the reach of any physician except the last trumpet A corpse in the Strand unowned soon drew a crowd among whom came a welldressed good looking young gentleman who was curious to see the dead man He had no sooner made his way through the mob so as to get a full view of the corpse than he was struck with amazement he remained fixed his countenance changed and the tears began to flow down his cheeks As soon as he could recover himself so far as to gain utterance he exclaimed"O God my poor uncle Is he gone Is heWell" said he with a deep sigh "so perish my hopes I am happy however that I luckily passed at this awful moment to rescue his poor remains and see them decently interred" Accord∣ingly the sorrowful youth called a coach and the charitable mob who pitied the disconsolate nephew assisted to put the corpse in the coach where the pious young man soon stripped the body and desiring to be set down at a famous surgeon's very conscientiously sold his pretended uncle for two guineas  IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CATORGAN ADDRESSED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY  GENTLEMEN  I Need not inform persons of your infinite experience and erudition that the CatOrgan as it has hitherto been made use of was no more than what followeth viz A plain harpsichord which instead of having strings and jacks con∣sists of Cats of different sizes included in boxes whose voices express every note in the gamut which is extorted from the imprisoned animals by placing their tails in grooves which are properly squeezed by the impression of the organist's fingers on the keys This instrument unimproved as it was I have often heard with incredible delight but especially in the grand and plaintive This delight grew upon me every time I was present at it's performance At length I shut myself up for se∣ven years to study some additions and improvements which I have at length accomplished agreeable to my warmest wishes and which I with all due submission now lay before you  In the first place then it is universally known and acknow∣ledged that these animals at the time of their amours are the most musical creatures in nature I would therefore recom∣mend it to all and singular CatOrganists to have a most espe∣cial  regard to the time of caterwauling particularly if they have anything very august or affecting to exhibit  Secondly it is also very well known that the best voices are improved by castration I therefore never have less than eight geldings in my treble clef And here I cannot help informing you of an experiment I lately made on an Italian boarcat and and English one of the same gender and I solemnly protest that after the operation my country animal had every whit as delicate piercing and comprehensive a tone as the foreigner and I make no sort of doubt that some of our harmonious Eng∣lishmen would shine with an equal lustre if they had the same advantages as the Italians This may be worth the considera∣tion of people in power for if this experiment had been tried with success how many thousand pounds would it have saved this nation  Thirdly Of the Forte and Piano I must not omit to tell you gentlemen that my CatOrgan resembles a double harp∣sichord for as that has two rows of keys so mine has two layers of Cats both of a lesser size and whose tails are squeezed by a much less pressure that is by nothing but the bare ex∣tremity of the key But the lower row on which I play forte or loudly contains an harmonious society of banging grimalkins and whose tails are severely pricked by brass pins inserted at the end of the key for that purpose  Fourthly Of the Shake There was one enormous defect in this instrument before I took it in hand and that was in the shake the imperfection of which gave me great offence But as it is now managed it has the most ravishing effect in the world There are between all the keys little wires fixed almost imperceptibly these go underneath till they reach each puss's throat at the extremity of these wires are placed hori∣zontally wrens quills about the length of a quarter of an inch When the artist therefore has a mind to form his shake he touches the wires which soon send the quills in a tickle tickle tickle tickle up to the Cat's throat and causes the most gur∣gling warbling shaking quaking trembling murmuring sound in the world  Fifthly Of the Staccato and an infallible method of keep∣ing the fourfooted performers under proper regulations  This most intolerable deficiency of the old CatOrgan was as follows some of the Cats were apt to continue their mew after the proper note was expressed to the great confusion of the tune and vexation of the organist This I have entirely cured and I think I can play the most perfect staccato in the world I have underneath my instrument a treddle like that of a spinningwheel which I work with my foot this  treddle actuates a certain number of forceps or pincers which open and shut at my pleasure upon the noses and chins of all the Cats and if any of them overact their part I tip St Dunstan upon Mrs Puss and she is obliged of necessity to be silent  Sixthly Of the education of Cats for the Organ My pre∣decessors were egregiously out in this article as well as many others which whatever it may appear to the incredulous or incurious is a matter of importance With regard to their diet milk and flummery fried mice and fish have the best ef∣fect I mean for the trebles and tenors as for the bases I have fed them with good success on bullock's liver hog's harslet's and sometimes with viands of a much less delicate nature As for exercise moderate mousing and being well tugged and hauled about by the children will very well suffice  Mr Collier in his Essay on Musick saysthat he makes no doubt that there might be a warlike instrument contrived of such an hideous sound that instead of inspiring men with cou∣rage it would strike the most undaunted with dismay This may be effected by the abovementioned instrument for though the CatOrgan when accurately in tune is incomparably me∣lodious yet it may be so managed as to utter shrieks very lit∣tle inferior to the cries of the infernals themselves Happy that instrument where terror and transport ornament and utility are so exquisitely blended which by it's persuasive harmony can at one time draw St Cecilia from the spheres and at another with proper alteration would frighten away the devil himself in propriâ personâ  THE WOODEN SWORD A POPISH MIRACLE  WHEN Naples was once closely besieged the viceroy is∣sued a severe order that no man above or under such an age should appear in the streets without a sword on pain of death That he might be sure this order was strictly obey∣ed he and his officers rode up and down the city to see that none offended During their progress they perceived a gen∣tleman without his sword who being brought to the viceroy was immediately condemned to be hanged on the next sign∣post The gentleman pleaded hard for his life but to no pur∣pose He then entreated that at least he might not suffer so ignominious a death but die like a gentleman as he was humbly desiring that the next gentleman who came by with a sword might be permitted to run him through the body  This being granted presently came along one who had just quitted a gaminghouse where he had lost all even to the very blade of his sword which was of choice Spanish steel and durst not go home till he had got a wooden one fitted to the hilt and scabbard Being now stopped he was told the case and what office he was appointed to perform Consci∣ous of his own insufficiency to execute the business he was so confounded that he scarcely knew how to reply "What" exclaimed he "would you make a common executioner of me Alas shall I stain my blood to eternity Heaven de∣fend my honour from such baseness" All his remonstrances however proving quite fruitless he prepared himself for the work and keeling down prayed" O Just and Almighty Ruler of Heaven if this man ought not to die convert this my faithful sword into wood" Then plucking it out and it appearing plainly to be a wooden blade the condemned gentle∣man was immediately released with abundance of joy and the sword was carried with great solemnity to the cathedral church where it was hung up as a true link to the chain of Popish miracles  LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF A WILL  THE "glorious uncertainty of the law" extends itself over every state where any regulated code exists In∣genuity of counsel in the explanation of periods and interpre∣tation of meanings is exercised with as much success in the courts of our Gallick neighbours as in those of our own coun∣try Some time before the abolition of the Jesuits a gentle∣man of Paris died and left all his estate from an only son then abroad to that body of religious men on condition that on his return the worthy fathers should give him  "la partie qui leur plairoit"whatever they chose  When the son came home he went to the convent and received but a very small share indeed the wise sons of Loyola  chasing  to keep the greatest part to themselves The young gentleman consulted his friends and all agreed that he was without remedy At last a barrister to whom he happened to mention his case ad∣vised him to sue the convent and promised to gain him his cause The gentleman followed his advice and the suit ter∣minated in his favour through the management of the advo∣cate who grounded his plea on this reasoning' The tella∣tor" said the ingenious barrister "has left his son  that  share of the estate which the fathers should  chuse "la partie qui leur plairoit"  are the express words of the will Now it is plain  what part they have  chose  by what they keep to themselves My client then stands on the words of the will Let me have" says he "  the part they chose  and I am satisfied" It was accordingly awarded to him without hesitation  KING RICHARD's THREE DAUGHTERS  ONE Fulk a Frenchman of high repute for sanctity told King Richard the First that he kept Three Daughters who would certainly bring on him the wrath of God if he did not part with them "Why you hypocrite" exclaimed Richard "all the world knows I never had a child in my life""Yes" replied the monk "you have as I asserted three and their names are Pride Covetousness and Lewd∣ness"" Well" retorted the king since it is so I will soon dispose of them the Knights Templars shall have the first the White Friars the second and the third shall be given to the secular Clergy"  THE SOLDIER'S SALVO OR THE CARDS SPIRITUALIZED  BY A PRIVATE SOLDIER  ONE Richard Middleton a private soldier attending di∣vine service with the rest of the regiment at a church in Glasgow instead of pulling out a bible like his brother soldiers in order to search for the text spread a pack of cards before him This singular behaviour did not long pass unno∣ticed either by the minister or the serjeant of the company to which he belonged the latter in particular commanded him to put up his cards and on his refusal conducted him after divine service before the chief magistrate to whom he preferred a formal complaint of Richard's irreverend behaviour "Well soldier" said the magistrate "what excuse have you to offer for this strange and scandalous behaviour If you can make any apology or assign any reason for it 'tis well if you cannot assure yourself that I will cause you to be severely pu∣nished"" Since your honour is so good" replied Richard "as to permit me to speak for myself an't please your worship I have been eight days on the march with a bare allowance of sixpence a day which your honour will surely allow is hardly sufficient to find a man in meat drink washing and other ne∣cessaries and consequently he may want either a bible prayerbook or any other book" On saying this Richard pulled  out his cards presented one of the aces to the magistrate and continued his address to him as follows"When I see an ace may it please your honour it reminds me that there is only one God and when I look on a two or a three the former puts me in mind of the Father and Son and the latter of the Father Son and Holy Ghost A four calls to my remem∣brance the four evangelists Matthew Mark Luke and John a five the five Wise Virgins who were ordered to trim their lampsthere were ten ordered but five your worship may remember were wise and five were foolisha six that in six days God created heaven and earth a seven that on the se∣venth day he rested from all he had made an eight of the eight righteous persons preserved from the Deluge viz Noah and his wife with his three sons and their wives a nineof the lepers cleansed by our Saviourthere were ten but one only returned to offer his tribute of thanks and a ten of the ten commandments" Richard took the knave and placed it by him and then passed to the Queen on which he observed as follows"This queen your worship reminds me of the Queen of Sheba who came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon as her companion the king does of the Great King of Heaven and of King George the Third""Well" replied the magistrate "you have given me a very good description of all the cards except the knave""If your honour will not be angry with me" re∣plied Richard "I can give you the same satisfaction as to that as of any card in the pack""I will not" said the magistrate "Well" returned the soldier "the greatest knave I know is the serjeant who brought me before you" "I don't know" replied the magistrate "whether he is the greatest knave or not but I am sure he is the greatest fool or the two" The soldier then proceeded"When I count the number of dots in a pack of cards there are so many days are there in a year When I count how many cards there are in a pack I find fifty two so many weeks are there in a year When I reckon how many tricks are won by a pack of cards I find there are thirteen so many months are there in a year So that this pack of cards is both bible almanack and prayerbook to me"  The magistrate then called his servants ordered them to entertain the soldier well gave him a piece of money and said he was the cleverest fellow in the whole regiment  THE WELCH PARSON'S CURSE  A WELCH vicar being to read the curses as the custom is on AshWednesday when the people say Amen turn∣ing over the leaf and finding them to be many said"Dear∣ly  beloved brethren I am to read here a great many curses to you but because I am loth to trouble myself and tire your patience I will end them all in one" The curse of God light upon you all Amen  THE SCOTCH CROW AN ANECDOTE OF DR JOHNSON  DR Johnson travelling in the north of Scotland could not see a house or tree in riding a great many miles nothing but desolation and barrenness every where presenting themselves to his view till at last he cast his eyes on a crow that was perched on the stump of an old tree gnawing with great violence and kawing for want of food which the doctor observing could not help crying out" Kaw kaw kaw and be damn'd if you will stay in such a country as this when you have wings to fly away"  THE CONSIDERATE DEBTOR OR A CRUST FOR CRUEL CREDITORS  A Prisoner in the King's Bench lately sent to his cre∣ditor to let him know that he had a proposal to make which he believed would be for their mutual benefit Ac∣cordingly the creditor calling on him to hear it" I have been thinking" said he "that it is a very idle thing for me to lie here and put you to the expence of seven groats a week My being so chargeable to you has given me great uneasiness and God knows what it may cost you in the end There∣fore what I would propose is thisYou shall let me out of prison and instead of seven groats you shall allow me only eighteenpence a week and the other tenpence shall go to∣wards the discharge of the debt"  THE STAMMERERS A TALE  BY MR LONSDALE  WHILE others fluent verse abuse  And prostitute the Comick Muse  In less indecent manner I  Her comickladyship will try  Oh let my prayer bright maid avail  Grant inspiration to my tale  A tale both comical and new  And with a swingeing moral too  In a small quiet country town  Liv'd Hob a blunt but honest clown  Who spite of all the school could teach  From habit stammer'd in his speech  And second nature soon we're sure  Confirm'd the case beyond a cure  Ask him to say hot rolls and butter  "A hagagag' and 'splittersplutter"  Stopp'd every word he strove to utter  It happen'd once upon a time  I word it thus to suit my rhyme  For all our country neighbours know  It can't be twenty years ago  Our sturdy ploughman apt to strike  Was busy delving at his dyke  Which let me not forget to say  Stood close behind a publick way  And as he lean'd upon his spade  Reviewing o'er the work he'd made  A youth a stranger in the place  Stood right before him face to face  "Ppppppray" says he  "How fffffar may't be  "To o"the words would not come out  "To BoroughBridge or there about"  Our clown took huff thrice hemm'd upon't  Then smelt a kind of an affront  Thought he" This bluff foolhardy fellow  A little crack'd perhaps or mellow  Knowing my tongue an inch too short  Is come to fleer and make his sport  Wauns if I thought he meant to quarrel  I'd hoop the roynish rascal's barrel  If me he means or dares deride  By all that's good I'll tan his hide  I'll dress his vile calf's skin in buff  And thrash it tender where 'tis tough"  Thus full resolv'd he stood aloof  And waited mute for farther proof  While t'other in a kind of pain  Apply'd him to his tongue again  "Speak friend cccccan you pray  Shshshshow meon myway  Nay speeeak"" I'll smoak thy bacon"  "You have a ttongue or I'm mistaken"  "Yesthat ththat IIIhave  But not for yyyouyou knave"  "What" cry'd the stranger "whwhwhat  D'ye mock me Tttake you that"  "Huh you mockme" quoth Hob amain  "So tttake youthat again"  Then to't they fell in furious plight  While each one thought himself i'th' right  And if you dare believe my song  They likewise thought each other wrong  The battle o'er and somewhat cool  Each half suspects himself a fool  For when to choler folks incline 'em  Your argumentum baculinum  Administer'd in dose terrifick  Was ever held a grand specifick  Each word the combatants now utter'd  Conviction brought that both Dolts stutter'd  And each assum'd a look as stupid  As after combat looks Dan Cupid  Each scratch'd his silly head and thought  He'd argue ere again he fought  Hence I this moral shall deduce  Would Anger deign to sign a truce  Till Reason could discover truly  Why this mad Madam were unruly  So well she would explain their words  Men little use could find for swords  TYTHE IN KIND OR THE SOW'S REVENGE ON THE PARSON A TALE  BY MR FISHER  NOT far from London liv'd a boor  Who fed three dozen hogs or more  Alike remote from care and strife  He crack'd his joke and lov'd his wife  Madge like all women fond of sway  Was pleas'd whene'er she had her way  And wives will think I deal in fiction  But seldom met with contradiction  Then stubborn as the swine she fed  She neither would be driven nor led  And Goodman Hodge who knew her whim  Was kind nor row'd against the stream  Subdu'd by Nature's primal law  Young sows are ever in the straw  Each week so genial Fate decreed  Produc'd a new and numerous breed  Whene'er they came sedate and kind  The vicar was not far behind  Of pigs the worth and prime he knew  And parson like would have his due  He watch'd the hour with anxious ken  His heart grew warm at number ten  The younger pigs he vow'd the sweeter  And scarce allow'd them time to litter  One morn with smile and bow polite  From Hodge he claim'd his custom'd right  But first enquir'd in accents mild  How far'd the darling wife and child  How apples pears and turnips grew  And if the ale were old or new  Hodge who from custom took the hint  Knew 'twas in vain a priest to stint  And while his rev'rence took his swig  Hodge stepp'd aside and brought the pig  "Humph" cried the parson "let us see  This offering to the church and me  I fear my friend 'twill never do  Methinks 'tis lean and sickly too  Time out of mind 't has been confess'd  Parsons should ever claim the best"  This said he ey'd it o'er and o'er  Stamp'd set his wig and all but swore  "Such pig for me why man alive  Ne'er from this moment hope to thrive  Think you for this I preach and pray  Hence bring me better tythes I say"  Hodge heard and and tho' by nature warm  Replied "Kind Sir I meant no harm  Since what I proffer you refuse  The stye is open pick and chuse"  Pleas'd with the offer in he goes  His heart with exultation glows  He rolls his eyes his lip  he licks  And scarce can tell on when to fix  At length he cries"Heav'n save the king  This rogue in black is just the thing  Hence shall I gain a rich regale"  Nor more but seiz'd it by the tail  Loud squeak'd the pig the sow was near  The piercing sound assail'd her ear  Eager to save her darling young  Fierce on the bending priest she sprung  Full in the mire his rev'rence cast  Then seiz'd his breech and held him fast  The parson roar'd surpriz'd to find  A foe so desp'rate close behind  On Hodge on Madge he calls for aid  But both were deaf to all he said  The scene a numerous circle draws  Who hail the sow with loud applause  Pleas'd they beheld his rev'rence writhe  And swore 'twas fairly tythe for tythe  "Tythe" cried the parson"Tythe dy'e say  See hereone half is rent away"  The case 'tis true was most forlorn  His gown his wig his breech was torn  And what the mildest priest might ruffle  The pig was lost amid the scuffle  "Give give me which you please" he cried  "Nay pick and chuse" still Hodge replied  "Chuse honest friend alas but how  Heav'n shield me from your murd'ring sow  When tythes invite in spite of foes  I dare take Satan by the nose  Like Theseus o'er the Styx I'd venture  But who that dreadful stye would enter  Yet while there's hope the prize to win  By Heav'n to leave it were a sin"  This said he arms his breast with rage  And half resolves the foe t'engage  Spite of the parson's angry mood  The fearless sow collected stood  And seem'd to wait the proffer'd war  With"Touch them scoundrel if you dare"  His last resource the parson tries  Hems strokes his chin and gravely cries  "Ye swains support your injur'd priest  Secure the pig and share the feast"  Staunch to his friend was ev'ry swain  Strange tho' it seem the bribe was vain  And Hodge who saw them each refuse  Exclaim'd in triumph"Pick and chuse"  The parson's heart grew warm with ire  Yet pride forbade him to retire  What numbers can his spleen declare  Denied for once his darling fare  How shall he meet the dreadful frown  Of Madam in the grogram gown  Who eager for her promis'd treat  Already turns the useless spit  "Wretch" he exclaims with voice profound  "Can no remorse thy conscience wound  May all the woes th'ungodly dread  Fall thick on thy devoted head  May'st thou in ev'ry wish be cross'd  May all thy hoarded wealth be lost  May'st thou on weeds and offals dine  Nor ale nor pudding e'er be thine"  Hodge who with laughter held his sides  The parson's wrath in sport derides  "No time in idle preaching lose  The stye is openpick and chuse"  Loud plaudits rose from ev'ry tongue  Heaven's concave with the clamours rung  Impatient of the last huzza  The tytheless parson sneak'd away  THE NUTBROWN MAID OR GINGERBREAD WIFE  AS marriage often causes woeful strife  And once the die is cast 'tis cast for life  Well it behoves each provident young man  To watch observe take all the heed he can  In this our age the golden days are fled  And iron ones are risen in their stead  Money is moneythat's a well known truth  Tho' squander'd much by giddy headstrong youth  What are those darts of which so much we're told  Poor harmless thingsunless they're tipp'd with gold  Mock the sly urchin baffle all his power  If he descend not in a golden shower  Bravely resolv'd and see the wish'dfor fair  Mark well her presence what a shape an air  Her flowing robe with shining ore is spread  And the gay crescent glitters on her head  ListenO list to me your faithful friend  And view the damsel well I recommend  What tho' the lily her fair gloss deny  The sweet jonquil can richer tints supply  What tho' the rose deny her glowing shade  Yet is she still a comely NutBrown Maid  So mild her manners such bewitching grace  E'en children gaze with rapture on her face  And then her virtues are so very rare  Trust me good Sir she'll suit you to a hair  First as to tempernot fam'd Hybla's hill  Where bees their honey sip more sweets can fill  Sweets mix with sweets in mind in form in feature  In short you never metso sweet a creature  Few are her words she'll never contradict  But meekly bear whatever you inflict  If storms of anger should sometimes arise  And terror flash indignant from your eyes  Tho' o'er her head the threat'ning tempest roll  No words can shake the firmness of her soul  Fix'd and unmov'd she'll patiently abide  Perchance may tremble but will never chide  Indeed her taciturnity is such  She rather talks too little than too much  Her shape Matt Prior justly doth express  "Fine by degrees and beautifully less"  Her yellow tresses charming to

THE COMICK MAGAZINE  NUMBER VI  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE VI THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE OUT OF HIS TIME AND MARRIED TO HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER  IN this print Francis Goodchild the Industrious Appren∣tice receives what may be denominated commercial as well as poetical justice His worthy master Mr West at the completion of his apprenticeship has not only taken him into partnership as appears from the union of their names "West and Goodchild" on the sign but he also receives from his master's hand the still superior blessing of an amiable virtuous and beloved daughter  The residence of these respectable citizens is situated near the Monument part of which stately column as well as the first lines of the Inscription is sufficiently visible The point of time is the morning after the happy nuptials while the newly married pair are at breakfast The cavalcade of drummers butchers with marrowbones and cleavers the man with the bassviol c form the then usual concert on such occasions and which is not remarkably figurative of the harmony that ought to follow the ceremony it pretends to celebrate The wretched cripple in the corner who is adding to the Hymeneal musick by vociferating the ballad of Jesse or the Happy Pair represents a well known beggar of that period commonly called Philip in the Tub and who within the memory of some per∣sons still living is recollected to have been a usual attendant at  most weddings in the metropolis The poor wretchwho has perhaps too feminine an aspectappears to have lost both legs above the knee and to have shuffled along in his tub by the aid of a low stool for the righthand There is much senti∣ment even in the attitude and aspect of this mendicant's dog and the irascibility of one of the butchers with the mixed per∣sonal terror and anxiety about his instrument manifested by the bass vi  l performer who has good reason for the concern thus depicted in his countenance at once gives forcible action and a striking contrast to the general intended harmony of the scene While Mr Goodchild is generously presenting a piece of mo  ey to the principal drummer his servant is employed in charitably distributing some remains of the marriagefeast to a poor woman and her infant The Bride is also at the window but in the back ground modestly gratifying the curiosity of the spectators with a sight of her agreeable person and not any vanity of her own by an ostentatious display of gaudy dress or the smallest degree of personal affectation  The motto is exactly what it ought to be  "The virtuous woman is a crown to her husband"  PRO∣VERBS xii  HUMOROUS SPECIMEN OF ALLITERATION IN AN EPISTLE FROM PAUL PHILIP PRICE ESQ AT PEM∣BROKE TO MR PETER PETTIWARD AT PUTNEY  DEAR SIR  PERCEIVING you particularly desirous to know how I pass my time in Pembrokeshire I here present you with particulars of my proceedings in a progress I lately made to a gentleman's house purely to procure a plan of it  I proceeded in a party of pleasure with Mr Pratt of Pickton Castle Mr Powell of Penally and Pugh of Purley to go and dine with Mr Pritchard of Postmain which was readily agreed to and soon put in practice However I thought it a proper precaution to post away a person privately to Mr Pritchard's that he might provide for us and we proceeded after him The town where Mr Pritchard lives is a poor pitiful paltry place though his house is in the prettiest part of it and is a prince's palace to the rest His parlour is of a lofty pitch and full of pictures of the prime pencils he hath a pomp∣ous portico or pavilion prettily paved leading to the parterre from whence you have a prodigious prospect particularly point∣ing towards Percilly Hill where he propagates a parcel of Por∣tuguese  and Polish poultry The name of his house is Praw∣fenden which puzzled me most plaguily to pronounce proper∣ly He received us very politely and presented us with a plen∣tiful dinner At the upperend of the table was a pike with fried perch and plaise at the lower end pickled pork pease and parsnips in the middle a pigeonpye with puffpaste on the one side a potatoepudding and on the other side pigs petty∣toes The second course was a dish of pheasants with poults and plovers and a plate of preserved pine and pippins another with pickled podd pepper another with prawns another with pargamon for a provocative with apyramid pears peaches plums pippins philberts and pislachi  After din∣ner there was a profusion of port and punch which proved too powerful for poor Mr Peters the parson of the pari  for it pleased his palate and he poured it down by pints which made him prate in a pedantick and pragmatical manner This displeased Mr Price the parliamentman a profound politician but he persisted and made it a prolix preamble which proved his principles prejudiced and pa  tial against the present people in power Mr Price who is a potent partyman called him a Popish parson and said he prayed privately in his heart for the Pretender and that he was a presumptuous priest for preaching such stuff publickly The parson puffed his pipe passively for some time because Mr Price was his patron but at length losing all patience he plucked off Mr Price's perriwig and was preparing to push it with the point of the poker into the fire upon which Mr Price perceiving a pew∣ter pisspot in the passage presented the parson with the con∣tents in his phizz and gave him a pat on the pate the percus∣sion of which prostrated him plump on the pavement and raised a protuberance on his pericranium This put a period to our proceedings and patched up a peace for the parson was in a piteous plight and had prudence enough to be pre∣vailed upon to cry  "Peccavi"  with a  "Parce precor"  and in a plaintive posture to petition for pardon Mr Price who was proud of his performance pulled him out of the puddle and protested he was prodigiously sorry for what had passed in his passion which partly proceeded from the provocation pro∣duced by some of his preposterous propositions which he prayed him never to presume to advance again in his presence Mr Pugh who practised physick prescribed phlebotomy and a poultice to the parson but he preferred wetted brownpaper to any plaister and then placed himself in a proper position that the power of the fire might penetrate his posteriors and dry his purple plushbreeches This pother was succeeded by poli∣ticks as Mr Pulteney the patriot's patent for the peerage  the Kings of Poland and Prussia Prague the Palatines Pan∣dours and par izans Portsmouth pa  ades and the presumption of the privateers picking up prizes in our very ports with places and pensions pains and penalties Next came on plays and poetry the picture of Mr Pope petched on a prosti∣stute the price of the playhouses the pit pantomimes prudes the pox the primate of Ireland printers paupers pre∣ferments pickpockets pensioners pointers puppies and the pranks of that prig the poet lauret's progeny though his papa is the perfect pattern of paternal piety To be brief I prophesy you perceive I am prolix We parted at last but had great difficulty to procure a passage from Mr Pritcuard for he had placed a padlock on the stabledoor on purpose to prevent us and pretended his servant was gone out with the key but find∣ing us peremptory the key was produced and we were per∣mitted to go We pricked our palfreys a good pace although it was as dark as pitch which put me in pain because I was purblind lest we should ride plumb against the posts which are prefixed to keep horsepassengers from going the path that is pitched with pebbles  Mr Price who was our pilot had a very providential escape for his pad fell a prancing and would no pass one step farther which provoked him much for he piques himself on his horse∣manship I propo  ed to him to dismount which he did and peeping and peering about found he was upon the point of a perpendicular precipice from which he might probably have pitched pate forward had not his ho  se plunged in that parti∣cular manner This put us all into a palpitation and we plod∣ded on the rest of the progression  pian piano  as the Italians say or  pazz à pazz  as the French phrase has it I shall postpone other particulars till I have the pleasure of passing a day with you at Putney which shall be as soon as possible I am Sir your most humble Servant  PAUL PHILIP PRICE  To Mr Peter Pettiward at Putney Pennypost paid  SCHEME FOR A WHISTLING ACADEMY  WE have often compassionated the great uneasiness num∣bers of young gentlemen at this day labour under for want of knowing how to spend their time which seems to hang heavy on their hands being destitute of a proper employ∣ment To see so many distressed mortals sauntering about from coffeehouse to coffeehouse or from alehouse to ale∣house tiring themselves and those about them must certainly  afford a melancholy prospect to every good natured man living Read they cannot to think is a task more difficult Unable therefore to be one moment alone they run into any sort of company that first occurs talking without sense laughing without wit and by this means become the ridicule of all their acquaintance In this wretched state despised by men and made the laughingstock of women they have recourse to the bottle With this they regale and in a short time be∣come the most whimsical impertinen  and rattleheaded fel∣lows in the world  If this species of mortals did not think themselves too wise and too happy to stand in need of advice or to wish a change in their condition it would certainly be worth while to con∣sider if some easy accomplishment suited to their capacities might not be found out the learning and practice of which might serve to render them supportable to themselves and not altogether insupportable to those who are so unhappy as to fall into their bad company  To answer both these good purposes I can think of nothing so likely as their learning to  whistle  It is an attainment per∣fectly suited to their genius equal to their abilities and in all likelihood superior to any of their accomplishments I would therefore teach these untutored gentlemen to apply themselves instantly to the making at least one acquisition that may raise them to a level with something in the animal creation If they could but  whistle  w  ll they might be able to converse with the blackbird and thrush almost on an equality an advantage they seldom enjoy in human conversation unless a prostitute a horse or the cut of a coat c happen to be the subject Besides their endeavouring to attain an accomplishent that may serve as an innocent amusement in the midst of a world where so many pernicious ones abound will be an instance of their singular virtue and supply the want of thought which want they seem to labour under in the most easy or natural way  How happy had it been for young Hazard if instead of at∣tempting what he is by no means equal to namely the art of gaming he had applied himself to the attainment of this amusing science He might then with a merry heart have been  whistling  for his diversion whereas now he may in bitter∣ness of soul go  whistle  for his estate  If some of those creatures also who call themselves poets were wise enough to apply their talents to  whistling  they might fairly pretend to some sort of harmony but now they are not only destitute of that but of every thing else that might atone for the want of it  The description of Cymon in that beautiful tale of Mr Dryden has ever been esteemed a natural and agreeable pic∣ture There is something in him so undesigning that one is as∣sured he must be possessed of an honest heart and cannot help conceiving an affection for him merely in seeing him walk and hearing him  whistle    "He trudg'd along unknowing what he sought  And  whistled  as he went for want of thought"  How harmless is his employment how inoffensive his be∣haviour Now I should be heartily glad to see any of our sauntering fellows make so unexceptionable a figure as this ho∣nest clown But these gentlemen's want of thought generally leads them into a thousand impertinences and instead of learning to  whistle  they are frequently making ridiculous pre∣tensions to taste learning or politicks and there is not a coffee∣house in London but will furnish us with melancholy instances of this strange misapplication of talents  To prevent such fatal mistakes for the future I humbly pro∣pose that a WHISTLING ACADEMY be founded for the use of such gentry c whether young or old as shall be judged pro∣perly qualified to be admitted members of this new musical so∣ciety contributions for which will no doubt be chearfully and liberally made by the innumerable persons of respectability who are at present continually pestered by the impertinence of such coxcombs  AMOROUS EPISTLE FROM AN ATTORNEY ON THE CIRCUIT TO THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTIONS IN TOWN  DEAREST CHARMER  THE circuit it now at an

MENDICANT  DINING lately with a convivial party a few miles from town the following adventure happened  The cloth being removed and the glass beginning to circu∣late a man very slovenly as well as raggedly dressed introduced himself cap in hand to the company Surprized at the con∣duct of our host in permitting such a person to intrude himself we were about to call in the landlord for an explanation when the man undertook to apologize for himself and excul∣pate  the people of the house who he declared had not seen him enter  The singular impudence of the fellow added to the peculiar stile of his address so superior to that of the vulgar excited our curiosity and we were anxious to be informed of the motives that could induce a person of his athletick form and youthful appearance to submit to the humiliating and precarious pro∣fession of a common beggar  "An hereditary disorder gentlemen" replied he "which has brought several of our family to their graves even before they arrived at my age I have myself been discharged as in∣curable from every hospital appropriated to my malady This gentlemen obliges me to adopt this disagreeable method of sup∣porting a miserable existence""But your complaint" re∣plied one of the company "My delicacy gentlemen" re∣turned the mendicant "will not permit me to disclose the nature of my disease in so publick a manner but if any gen∣tleman will retire with me into another apartment I doubt not that I shall give him such satisfaction as cannot fail to operate in my favour"  It was accordingly agreed that a wag of the faculty should attend him into the next room who returning in a few mi∣nutes exclaimed with much apparent concern"Poor fel∣low I do indeed recommend him as a real object of your be∣nevolence and shall begin with subscribing a shilling for his relief" The fellow then went round with his hat and the collection being pretty successful he retired uttering a thou∣sand benedictions on the kindhearted gentlemen as soon as he was gone some of the company became very im∣portunate with the young surgeon respecting the man's com∣plaint which it was unanimously agreed he was now bound to reveal and as he was convinced that the fellow had by this time taken care to secure his retreat he immediately informed us that LAZINESS was the incurable disease which had afflict∣ed this man from his infancy that he gave him a shilling to open the subscription and that in fact we were all bit  INFALLIBLE PRESERVATIVE AGAINST DUELLING  BY MR HARRISON  THE practice of duelling has of late become so frequent that most persons who have any brains to lose think it not at all unlikely if they mix much in what is called polite  life that they may some day or other be deprived of them by a pistolbullet  For my own part I am one of those oldfashioned mortals who being convinced that they have none to spare are desirous of preserving what they have as long as possible and this dis∣position as my inclinations lead me a good deal into com∣pany has sometimes subjected me to considerable difficulties However as I have hitherto continued to "sleep in a whole skin" and am now ne  rly arrived at my first grand climac∣terick an age when it may be supposed I need not be under any great apprehensione of being called outa sketch of the manner in which I have so long preserved myself alike un∣wounded in person and eputationI mean reputation for cou∣rage all other kinds of reputa ion being foreign to the present subjectmay not be unserviceable to those who from mo∣tives similar to my own are led to mingle with society but who may occasionally feel themselves under some degree of constraint  A few years ago when duelling was much less fashionable than at present I happened to be at a coffeehouse where two young fellows both ensigns in the army sat discoursing of their preced∣ing night's pretended amours in a stile of such grossness and in tones of such vociferation that the company in general was greatly scandalized and a very decent young woman in par∣ticular who officiated in the bar and for whose ear it was evi∣dent their loose conversation was peculiarly intended blushed so immoderately and was so greatly confused that her situation pained me more than I can easily describe I waited a short time in expectation that some man of spirit would interfere for I am myself naturally averse to quarrelling but to my surprize though I could perceive the eye of the whole room were occasion∣ally on the two striplings and most of them with looks of dis∣gust when either of the obnoxious parties looked round for ap∣plause which they very often seemed to do many of the company were mean enough to assume a sort of grin of approcation and the rest to a man hastily turned away their heads This uni∣versal cowardice arouzed me I felt myself bold and a glow of conscious superiority animated my cheek I rose from my seat and took my station at the fire facing about to the youths who sat opposite and eyeing them with contempt The in∣creased sternness of my visage soon attracted their attention it had probably not pleased them before and one of them after whispering the other had the audacity to address me with "Sir I shall look as sulky as you do if you continue to stand before the fire""Sir" replied I "you are an imper∣tinent scoundrel and having grossly infulted the whole room  with impunity you are I suppose beginning to offend every one individually"  In an instant the heroes were both on their legs and a scene of confusion and altercation enfued easy to conceive but impossible to be expressed  It was insisted by the companion of him who had affronted me that I should submit to ask pardon of the gentleman whom I had denominated a scoundrel or meet him the next day in Hyde Park He appealed with great vehemence to the com∣pany if the word scoundrel was proper to be used by a gentle∣man or if any man of honour could tamely put up with the application of it to himself The extorted answer was almost universally"Certainly not" And it seemed the general opinion that the difference could only be accommodated in one of the ways proposed  Elated with his success he turned to me with great serocity and demanded to know whether I chose to make the necessary concessions or to meet his friend in the field  "I alike despise" hastily returned I "your friend and yourself and so far am I from acceding to your proposals or being convinced that I have bestowed an improper appellation on your infamous companion that I repeat he is a base scoun∣drel and that you are as shabby a rascal as himself"  His sword was now out in a moment and though I was unarmed the dastardly villain actually made a lunge at me swearing bitterly that he would run me through the body if I did not immediately entreat his forgiveness But I snatched instantaneously the poker from the fire and with a single stroke shivered his sword at the same moment driving him to the wall by thrusting the redhot weapon close to his face which appeared evidently pale with fear notwithstanding the rubicund reflection of the poker In the mean time his com∣panion was not idle but having likewise drawn he was ad∣vancing to salute me  à posteriori  when the company per∣ceiving I was more likely to quiet the young sparks than they had at first dared to hope very manfully interposed and pre∣vented the attack in my rear  Having obliged the young gentleman to ask my pardon in∣stend of my asking his under pain of a more intimate acquain∣tance with the still red poker I turned to the other who had by this time been compelled to deliver up his weapon and ex∣acted from him a similar apology He however continued obstinately to refuse though every body was now clamorous against him till a slight application of the poker to his chin convinced him that I was not to be trifled with and he also acknowledged the impropriety of his behaviour  As I was disgusted with the profusion of compliments which  were now bestowed on my spirited conduct by the company I soon quitted the room and was the next day informed by a friend who happened to step in a short time after my depar∣eure that the discomfited champions and all the company joined very cordially together in censuring the grossness of my behaviour particularly my total disregard to good manners in the choice of my expressions  Thus ended a business which seemed to threaten something more serious for though the young gentlemen protested ve∣hemently that they would have their revenge whenever they should meet with me they took great care to avoid visiting every place where it was likely I might be found Yet these youths were said to have actually seen service and to have each killed his man certain it is that they had for a long time overawed the company which usually frequented the coffeehouse where I accidentally encountered them and had totally driven away no inconsiderable number of customers  It would fill a volume of no contemptible size to recount minutely the various skirmishes in which I have at different times been engaged and yet if I know myself I am as much disposed to treat every one with civility and as studious in avoiding all occasions of offence as any person living  Indeed I am not unwilling to believe that I am constitu∣tionally what the world calls a coward for I really have never been able to discover in myself the pleasing sensation which some men of spirit seem to feel in taking a waiter by the nose or ears or kicking a footman's posterios for accidentally treading on my toes running against me on entering or quit∣ting a room when I have chanced to stand in their way or any similar offence I may on such occasions have been prompted to use very intemperate language but I have usually been afterwards weak enough to think that my resentment was even then more than adequate to the crime  But it will be said"What has this to do with duelling There is no danger at least for the present of being challenged by a waiter or footman" I am afraid however that the same irascible spirit which leads a gentleman to delight in tweaking the nose of the former or kicking the breech of the latter will sometimes make him so far forget himself as to take a "wrong pig by the ear"  The inference is plain A man of spiritthat is one who has long enjoyed the supreme felicity of seeing every one ap∣proach him with fear and tremblingsuddenly finding a strong opposition to his high behests ventures to try the force of per∣sonal threats he challenges his antagonist and borne up by that enthusiasm which is always denominated courage though it should sometimes have a very different appellation he goes  to the field where he pronably leaves an existence which has too long been offensive to society  So far duelling may be said to be rather serviceable than pre∣judicial to mankind and if it always happened that the ag∣gressor was not the survivor the practice would be much less liable to objection But for this material property I believe it's warmest advocates have not attempted to contend  I shall however avoid entering into the rationality of the custom of that every one who has common understanding is perhaps full as able to judge as myself and any arguments would be thrown away on persons of inferior capacity  I have already given some reasons for the suspicion I have ever entertained that I am myself naturally a coward I really never enjoyed personal contests for though when a lad I had now and then manual struggles for supetiority and was always for∣tunate enough to prove the victor I never engaged but with reluctance  This antipathy however to decisions by combat has never prevented me from giving my sentiments freely on any subject in whatever company I have fallen and though I am not wholly unacquainted with  he art of verbal retreat it is perhaps the only species of defence I have ever been afraid of adopt∣ing  That I have from the various disputations in which I have been engaged received at least twenty challenges and more than twice as many menaces will not be greatly wondered at by those who know life when I inform them that I have now and then sat for a whole hour together with young sunaltern offi  ers both of the army and navy gamesters of all the diffe∣rent species fortunehunters men of gallantry great wits led captains and politicians Indeed I doubt not that many young men of the town who associate constantly with such companions have at half my age had at least double the num∣ber  In extricating myself from these difficulties I have never once had occasion to apply for redress to the laws of my coun∣try though as they certainly are as well calculated to pre∣serve the weak the infirm the aged and the meek from the personal insults of the stouter the younger and more turbulent as human sagacity can possibly contrive I should by no means have felt myself degraded by appealing to those institutions which were planned by our progenitors when national bravery was not at it's lowest ebb with much less folly and absurdity than seems to be generally imagined by their abundantly wise successors had no quicker and equally efficacious remedies pre∣sented themselves  I have constantly found that the most boisterous heroes have been soon tranquilized when they were once thoroughly convinced that a man would not  fight fair  for though after positively refusing a challenge I have been often violently threatened with personal chastisement on my giving the parties to understand that I was not very delicate in my choice of weapons their menaces which I always treated with the most resolute defiance were seldom attempted to be put in execu∣tion Once indeed a young Hibernian raised his cane which was intended to salute my head or shoulders but on my seiz∣ing a candlestick which stood before me he thought proper to defer the discharge of his anger till he met with one who was less disposed to make him a suitable return  If this method be invariably pursued with becoming resolu∣tion it will I apprehend prove to others as it has long done to me an infallible preservative against duelling  SUBSTITUTE FOR THE DOGTAX  IN A LETTER FROM FARMER TRUEMAN'S TOWZER TO SQUIRE HEAVISIDE'S PONTO  DEAR PONTO  I Went home with Philis the parson's speckled bitch last Tuesday and to my great amazement I heard the doc∣tor declare that there is actually a scheme on foot to tax us poor dogs the consequence of which will be that three parts in four of our species will be knocked on the head I profess I am not in any dread for myself nor for you my dear Ponto for our usefulness will preserve us since men though they are by far the most ungrateful of all other ani∣mals seldom chuse to destroy what is of real benefit to them∣selves I am not therefore alarmed out of any selfish view no it is a noble spirit of patriotism that inflames me and though I say it there is not a dog in the nation that will fight more desperately or bark louder in a good cause than your old friend Towzer Let your sneaking puppies follow low mercenary views let them wag their tails at every scoundrel and nuzzle in dunghills for hall a bone I am a British mastiff and scorn such paltry actions I will venture to say that almighty Love itself cannot make me do a little thing and though I like a pretty bitch as well as another dog yet it is not in the power of the most charming of that bewitching sex either by day to make me kill a neighbour's sheep or by night to desert my post and leave my master's house unguarded  "But why all these professions of honesty to me" my Ponto will say "who have had long experience of Towzer's worth and imtegrity" True but at this conjuncture it is highly requisite thou shouldest think the best of me since I am about to engage thee in an affair the seriousness and importance of which cannot be too strictly at  ended to and the greater opinion thou hast of the proposer with the more alacrity wilt thou enter on the affair  One must be a stupid dog indeed not to know that not∣withstanding our almost innumerable taxes the ministry want money damnably Therefore this act will certainly take place unless we can start some other scheme from which more cole may be expected Such a scheme I have in my head but I am sensible is not to be brought to bear without thy assistance  Thy intimacy with Miss Biddy's lapdog will forward thee in the way that I shall chalk out to thee Thou must engage Shock to communicate my proposals to his fair mistress and at the same time back them with his interest and if she stands our friend we have nothing to fear for Sir Nathan Nimbletongue the member for the county is her slave and she has a pair of eyes that would dazzle a Roman senate into blindness to the common cause and corrupt the integrity of a Cato I have inclosed a copy of the scheme and rest ever thine most affectionately  TOWZER  TOWZER'S SCHEME FOR A POLLTAX ON THAT PART OF THE HUMAN SPECIES WHO ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE APPELLATIONS OF SAD DOGS LAZY DOGS AND PUPPIES  The family of the Sad Dogs has ever been reckoned without controversy the most ancient and most numerous of any in the kingdom if therefore they were taxed at the easy rate of one shilling per head they would bring in to the government annually at least four hundred thousand pounds sterling  The Lazy Dogs are those expletives of Nature which seem only formed to devour her works and prevent her from being burdensome to herself with her own exuberancy and would at sixpence a head produce the same sum at least  And lastly the Puppies that is to say the numerous tribe of Fops Coxcombs Witlings Pedants Poetasters Criticasters and Grammaticasters with many more of that strain would at threepence a Puppy bring in at an average  the same sum So there will be one million two hundred pounds sterling by these means redound from a soil which has hitherto brought forth nothing but has been buried in the weeds of corruption and the dearth of barrenness  THE KING'S COUSIN AND COUNSELLOR AN ANECDOTE OF GEORGE II AND THE EARL OF CHES∣TERFIELD  SOON after the late Earl of Chesterfield was made a mem∣ber of the Cabinet a place of great trust became vacant to which the Earl and the Duke of Dorset recommended two very different persons His Majesty contended for his own recommendation with much warmth and finding he was not likely to succeed he left the councilchamber in great anger protesting that he would be obeyed The king being retired a violent contest ensued but at length it was carried against him lest he should expect the same implicit obedience on other occasions when it might rise into a dangerous pre∣cedent The difficulty now was who should wait on the king in his present humour with the grant of the office for his signature a task which fell to the lot of Lord Chester∣field As his Lordship expected to find the king very little disposed to execute the business he prudently took care not to incense him by abruptly making the request but asked in accents of great humility with whose name his Majesty would be pleased to have the blanks filled up "With the Devil's" answered the king with all the vehemence of passion "And will your Majesty" coolly replied the Earl "permit the in∣strument to run as usual  "Our trusty and wellbeloved Cousin and Counsellor"  The King laughing very heartily immediately put his hand to the appointment and related to every body the success with which the noble Earl's wit had attacked his illhumour  APOLOGY FOR CORPOREAL COWARDICE A MILITARY ANECDOTE  A Gascon soldier being asked by his comrade what made him tremble so excessively while they were marching to the attack"My body" replied he "trembles to think on the dangers to which it knows it will soon be exposed by the bravery of my soul"  BEST METHOD OF DESTROYING ENEMIES  THE Emperor Sigismund being reproached for rewarding instead of destroying his enemies and thus giving them the power again to injure him"What" said the noble∣minded monarch "do not I destroy my enemies when I make them my friends"  This exalted sentiment is well worthy of being adopted by subjects as well as sovereigns by nations and by individuals  THE FARMER'S BLUNDER A TALE  A Farmer once to London went  To pay t  e worthy squire his rent  He comes he knocks soon entrance gains  Who at the door such guests detains  Forth struts the squire exceeding smart  "Farmer you're w  lcome to my heart  You've brought my rent then""To a hair"  "The best of tenants I declare"  The steward was call'd th' accounts made ev'n  The money paid receipt was giv'n  "Well" quoth the squire "now you shall stay  And dine with me old friend today  I've here some ladies wondrous pretty  And pleasant sparks I'll warr'nt will fit ye"  He scratch'd his ears and held his hat  And said"No Zur two words to that  For look d'ye zee when Ize do dine  With gentlefolks zo cruel fine  Ize use to makeand 'tis no wonder  In deed or word some plaguy blunder  Zo if your honour will permit  I'll with your servants pick a bit"  "Pho" says the squire "it sha'n't be done"  And to the parlour push'd him on  To all around he nods and scrapes  Nor waitingmaid nor butler scapes  With often bidding takes his seat  But at a distance mighty great  Though often ask'd to draw his chair  He nods nor comes an inch more near  By Madam serv'd with body bended  With knife and fork and arms extended  He reach'd as far as he was able  To plate that overhung the table  With little morsels cheats his chops  And in the passage much he drops  To shew where most his heart inclin'd  He talk'd and drank to John behind  When drank to in the modish way  "Your love's sufficient Zur" he'd say  And to be thought a man of manners  Still rose to make his aukward honours  "Pish" says the Squire "pray keep your sitting"  "No no" he cries "Zur 'tis not fitting  Tho' I'm no scholard vars'd in letters  I knaws my duty to my betters"  Much mirth the farmer's ways afford  And hearty laughs go round the board  Thus the first course was endedwell  But at the nextah what befel  The dishes now were timely plac'd  And table with fresh lux'ry grac'd  When drank to by a neighbouring charmer  Up as was usual stands the farmer  A wag to carry on the joke  Thus to his servant softly spoke  "Come hither Dick step gently there  And pull away the farmer's chair"  'Tis done his congee made the clown  Draws back and stoops to sit him down  But by posteriors overweigh'd  And of his trusty seat betray'd  As men at twigs in river sprawling  He catch'd the cloth to save his falling  In vainsad fortune down he wallow'd  And rattling all the dishes follow'd  The foplings lost their little wits  The ladies squall'd some fell in fits  Here tumbled turkies tarts and wigeons  And there minc'd pies and geese and pigeons  A pearpye on his belly drops  A custardpudding met his chops  Lord what ado 'twixt belles and beaux  Some curse some cry and rub their cloaths  This lady raves and that looks down  And weeps and wails her spatter'd gown  One spark bemoans bespatter'd waistcoat  One"Rot him" cries "he has spoil'd my lac'd coat"  Amidst the rout the farmer long  The pudding suck'd and held his tongue  At length he gets him on his breech  And scrabbles up to make his speech  First scrapes eyes mouth and nostril twangs  Then smacks his fingers and harangues  "Plague tak't Ize told you how 'twould be  Luck here's a pickle Zurs d'ye see  And some I'll warrant that makes this chatter  Have cloathers daub'd with grease and batter  That cost" He had gone on but here  Was stopp'd at once in his career  "Peace brute be gone" the ladies cry  The beaux exclaim"Fly rascal fly"  "I'll tear your eyes out" squeaks Miss Dolly  "I'll pink his soul out" roars a bully  At this the farmer shrinks for fear  And thinking 'twas ill tarrying here  Shabs off and cries"Aye kill me then  Whene'er you catch me here again  So home he jogs and leaves the squire  To cool the Sparks and ladies ire  Thus ends my tale and now I'll try  Like Prior something to apply  This may teach rulers of a nation  Ne'er to place men above their station  And this may shew the wanton wit  That while he bites he may be bit  THE TEST OF PATIENCE OR THE HOGS IN THE PARSON'S CELLAR  A Parson who had a remarkable foible  In minding the bottle much more than the bible  Was deem'd by his neighbours to be less perplex'd  In handling a tankard than handling a text  Perch'd up in his pulpit one Sunday he cried  "Make patience my dearly beloved your guide  And in all your trouble mischances and crosses  Remember the patience of Job in his losses"  Now this parson had got a stout cask of strong beer  A present no doubtbut no matter from where  Suffice it to say that he reckon'd it good  And valu'd the liquor as much as his blood  While he the churchservice in haste mutter'd o'er  The hogs found their way thro' the old cellar door  And by the sweet scent of the beerbarrel led  Had knock'd out the spigot or cock from it's head  Out spouted the liquor abroad on the ground  And the unbidden guests quaff'd it merrily round  Nor from their diversion or merriment ceas'd  Till ev'ry hog there was a true drunken beast  And now the grave lecture and prayers at an end  He brings along with him a neighbouring friend  To be a partaker of Sunday's good cheer  And taste his delightful Octoberbrew'd beer  The dinner was ready and all things laid snug  "Here wife" says the parson "go fetch up a mug"  But a mug of what liquor he'd scarce time to tell her  When"Lord husband" she cried "there's the hogs in the cellar  To be sure they've got in whilst we were at pray'rs"  "To be sure you're a fool so get you down stairs  And bring what I bid youGo see what's the matter  For now I myself hear a grunting and clatter"  She went and returning with sorrowful face  In suitable phrases related the case  He rav'd like a madman and snatching a broom  First belabour'd his hogs then his wife r  und the room  "Was ever poor mortal so pester'd as I  With a base slut who keeps all my house like a stye  How came you to have your damn'd hogs in the kitchen  Is that a fit place to keep cattle you bitch in"  "Lord husband" said she "what a coil you keep here  About a poor beggarly barrel of beer  You should in "your troubles mischances and crosses  Remember the patience of Job in his losses"  "A pox upon Job" cried the priest in a rage  "That beer I dare say was near three years of age  But you are a poor stupid fool like his wife  For Job never had such a cask in his life"  THE SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION A MATRIMONIAL TALE  BY MR ROBERT LLOYD  THE very silliest things in life  Create the most material strife  What scarce will suffer a debate  Will oft produce the bitterest hate  "It is" you sayI say "'Tis not"  Why you grow warmand I am hot  Thus each alike with passion glows  And words come first and after blows  Friend Jerkin had an income clear  Some fifteen pounds or more a year  And rented on the farming plan  Grounds at much greater sums per ann  A man of consequence no doubt  'Mongst all his neighbours round about  He was of frank and open mind  Too honest to be much refin'd  Would smoke his pipe and tell his tale  Sing a good song and drink his ale  His wife was of another mould  Her age was neither young nor old  Her features strong but somewhat plain  Her air not bad but rather vain  Her temper neither new nor strange  A woman'svery apt to change  What she most hated was conviction  What she most lov'd flat contradiction  A charming housewife ne'ertheless  Tell me a thing she could not dress  Soups hashes pickles puddings pyes  Nought came amissshe was so wife  For she bred twenty miles from town  Had brought a world of breeding down  And Cumberland had seldom seen  A farmer's wife with such a mien  She could not bear the sound of dame  NoMistress Jerkin was her name  She could harangue with wondrous grace  On gowns and mobs and caps and lace  But though she ne'er adorn'd his brows  She had a vast contempt for spouse  As being one who took no pride  And was a deal too countryfied  Such were our couple man and wife  Such were their means and ways of life  Once on a time the season fair  For exercise and chearful air  It happen'd in his morning's roam  He kill'd his birds and brought them home  "Here Cicely take away my gun  How shall we have these starlings done"  "Done what my loveYour wits are wild  Starlings my dear they're thrushes child"  "Nay now but look consider wife  They're starlings""No upon my life  Sure I can judge as well as you  I know a thrush and starling too"  "Who was it shot them you or I  They're starlings""Thrushes""Zounds you lye"  "Pray Sir take back your dirty word  I scorn your language as your bird  It ought to make a husband blush  To treat a wife so 'bout a thrush"  "Thrush Cicely""Yes""A starling" "No"  The lye again and then a blow  Blows carry strong and quick conviction  And mar the powers of contradiction  Peace soon ensued and all was well  It were imprudence to rebel  Or keep the ball up of debate  Against these arguments of weight  A year roll'd on in perfect case  'Twas"As you like" and"What you please"  Till in it's course and order due  Came March the twentieth fiftytwo  Quoth Cicely"Ah this charming life  No tumults now no blows no strife  What fools we were this day last year  Lord how you beat me then my dear  Sure it was foolish and absurd  To wrangle so about a bird  A bird not worth a single rush"  "A starling""No my love a thrush  That I'll maintain""That I'll deny"  "You're wrong good husband""Wife you lye"  Again the selfsame wrangle rose  Again the lye again the blows  Thus ev'ry yeartrue man and wife  Ensues the same domestick strife  Thus ev'ry year their quarrel ends  They argue fight buss and are friends  'Tis starling thrush and thrush and starling  "You dog""You bitch""My dear""My darling"  BACCHUS OR THE DRUNKEN METAMORHOSIS  BY DEAN PARNELL  AS Bacchus ranging at his leisure  Iö Bacchus king of pleasure  Charm'd the wide world with drink and dances  And all his thousand airy fancies  Alas he quite forgot the while  His favourite vines in Lesbos' isle  The god returning ere they died  "Ah see my jolly Fauns" he cried  "The leaves but hardly born are red  And the bare arms for pity spread  The beasts afford a rich manure  Fly my boys to bring the cure  Up the mountains o'er the vales  Through the woods and down the dales  For this if full the clusters grow  Your bowls shall doubly overflow"  So chear'd with most officious haste  They bring the dung of ev'ry beast  The loads they wheel the roots they bare  And lay the rich manure with care  While oft he bids them labour hard  And names as oft the red reward  The plants refresh'd new leaves appear  The thick'ning clusters load the year  The season swiftly purple grew  The grapes hung dangling deep with blue  The vineyard ripe a day serene  Now calls them all to work again  The Fauns through every furrow shoot  And load their flaskets with the fruit  And now the vintage early trod  The wines invite the jolly god  Strew the roses raise the song  See the master comes along  Lusty Revel join'd with Laughter  Whim and Frolick follow after  The Fauns besde the vats remain  To shew the work and reap the gain  All around and all around  They sit to riot on the ground  A vessel stands amid the ring  And there they laugh and there they sing  Or rise a jolly jolly band  And dance about it hand in hand  Dance about and shout amain  Then sit to laugh and sing again  Thus they drink and thus they play  The sun and all their wits away  But as an ancient author sung  The vines manur'd with ev'ry dung  From e'ery creature strangely drew  A tang of brutal nature too  'Twas hence in drinking on the lawns  New turns of humour seiz'd the Fauns  Here one was crying out"By Jove"  Another"Fight me in the grove"  This wounds a friend and that the trees  The Lion's temper reign'd in these  Another grins and leaps about  And keeps a merry world of rout  And talks impertinently free  While twenty talk as well as he  Chattering idle airy kind  These take the Monkey's turn of mind  Here one who saw the nymph that stood  To peep upon them from the wood  Skulks off to try if any maid  Be lagging late beneath the shade  While loose discourse another raises  In naked nature's plainest phrases  And ev'ry glass he drinks enjoys  With change of nonsense lust and noise  Mad and careless hot and vain  Such as these the Goat retain  Another drinks and casts it up  And drinks and wants another cup  Is very silent and sedate  Ever long and ever late  Full of meats and full of wine  This takes his temper from the Swine  There some who hardly seem to breathe  Drink and hang the jaw beneath  Gaping tender apt to weep  Their nature's alter'd by the Sheep  'Twas thus one Autumn all the crew  If what the poets say be true  While Bacchus made the merry feast  Inclin'd to one or other beast  And since 'tis said for many a mile  He spread the vine's of Leshos' isle  HEAD AND FEET A DIALOGUE  WRITTEN WHILE CONFINED BY THE GOUT IN BOTH FEET  SAYS my Head to my Feet"I have waited thus long  In hopes that your duty you would not prolong  But my patience worn threadbare and I in a fever  I'll never be serv'd so in future no never"  "Heyday" answer'd Feet "why how now Mr Bluff  Fair and soft if you please an't we punish'd enough  We feel for your follies and suffer our part  'Tis you've had the pleasure while we've had the smart"  "Say you so" exclaims Head "Oh you insolent elves  You know you are wholly wrapp'd up in yourselves  How oft have I serv'd you by writing and reading  Such wretches deserve not to live by good feeding"  "But hold" cries my Heart "Mr head you're to blame  Henceforward be wiser nor publish your shame  Had you not liv'd so fast as you deal in abuse  Want of exercise merely had been your excuse"  PROEM IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH  BY MR HARRISON  THO' in his offspring many a fault appears  For two alone the partial parent fears  Good ghostly criticks grant him absolution  They only lie in Plan and Execution  THE DEBT OF LIFE  OUR life is like a winter's day  Some only breakfast and away  Others to dinner stay and are full fed  The oldest man but sups and goes to bed  Large is his debt who lingers out the day  Who goes the sooness has the least to pay  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS PLATE VII  The Idle 'Prentice returnd from Sea in a Garret with a common Prostitute  THE COMICK MAGAZINE  NUMBER VII  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE VII THE IDLE 'PRENTICE RETURNED FROM SEA AND IN A CARRET WITH A COMMON PROSTITUTE  WHILE the preceding print represents the good youth rewarded by the possession of a virtuous woman in the present appears the sad contrast of his profligate fellowapprentice associated with one of those wretched outcasts of society who disgrace not only their sex but human nature With this loathsome being the tenant of a miserable garret he is now seen in bed He may be supposed to have deserted from the seaservice in consequence of the severe chastisement to which his idleness his vices and perhaps his cowardicefor the most profligate are by no means the most bravehave there continually subjected him The mode of life which he has subsequently pursued is sufficiently demonstrated by the pistols and other implements of the robber's trade as well as by the watches and trinkets which form his booty or rather that of the artful prostitute with whom he has formed the illicit connection This wretch whose filthy and diseased state is implied by the gallipot and phials on the mantlepiece surveys with composure a rich earring part of the precious spoil while her paramour conscious of the guilt by which it was obtained and in momentary dread of pursuing justice starts up petrified with horror on the falling of some loose bricks down the crazy chimney over which a cat was passing  and is at the same time headlong precipitated The expression of the two faces affords an admirable characteristick contrast The harlot partakes not like a virtuous woman in whatever may alarm the man who takes her to his bosom but constantly meditates on the means of attaining the to utmost benefit her∣self His joys are not her joys nor his griefs her griefs  Though this print is by no means crouded with objects every tittle it contains is descriptive of the wretchedness and disorder attendant on vicious life The precaution of continual apprehension has occasioned them to barricade the door with planks sloping from the floor the shattered plaster demonstrates the wretchedness of the place the brokendown bedstead is not without meaning the hoop hung over the bed'shead sarcastically conveys to the imagination what filthy beings may be occasionally covered with a fashionable article of dress and the drambottle with a broken glass the jug and pipe both likewise broken and the fractured bason on the mantleshelf all assist to display the consequences of indolence and ebriety Nor is the moral unassisted by the precipitate retreat of the rat scared at the noise from it's clandestine feast on the fragments left in the single plate lying with a knife by the bedside  In short the whole forms a print of admirable interest and makes us forcibly exclaim with the poet that  Vice to be hated needs but to be seen  The motto is most excellent  The sound of a shaken leaf shall chase him  LEVITICUS xxvi  COMPARISON FOR A WIFE OR NONE BUT THE WEARER CAN TELL WHERE THE SHOE PINCHES  A Roman being about to repudiate his wife among a variety of other questions from her enraged kinsmen was asked"Is not your wife a sensible woman Is she not a handsome woman Has she not borne you fine children" In answer to all which questions slipping off his shoe he held it up and in∣terrogated them in his turn"Is not this shoe" said he "a very handsome one Is it not quite new Is it not extremely well made How then is it that none of you can tell me where it pinches"  THE MODERN MAN OF HONOUR  THOSE who attack the fundamental laws of virtue and morality urge the uncertainty of them and alledge their variations in different countries and even in different ages in the same countries "Morality" say they "is local and consequently an imaginary thing since what is rejected in one climate as a vice is practised in another as a virtue" And according to them the voice of nature speaks as many different languages as there are nations in the world  The dangers and ill consequences of this doctrine are ob∣vious but surely the falsity of it is not less so and the most charitable opinion one can entertain of those who propagate it is that they mistake fashion and custom for nature and reason The invariable laws of justice and morality are the first and universal emanations of human reason while unprejudiced and uncorrupted and we may as well say that sickness is the na∣tural state of the body as that injustice and immorality are the natural situation of the mind We contract most of the dis∣tempers of the one by the irregularity of our appetites and of the other by yielding to the impetuosity of our passions but in both cases reason when consulted speaks a different lan∣guage  I admit that the prevailing customs and fashions of most countries are not founded on reason and on the contrary are too frequently repugnant to it but then the reasonable people of those countries contemn and abhor them though it may be they too wittingly comply with or at least have not courage openly enough to oppose them  The people of rank and distinction in every country are properly called the people of fashion because in truth they settle the fashion Instead of subjecting themselves to the laws they take measure of their own appetites and passions and then make laws to fit them which laws though neither sounded in justice nor enacted by a legal authority too often prevail over and insult both justice and authority This is fashion  In this light I have often considered the word Honour in it's fashionable acceptation in this country and must confess that were that the universal meaning of it throughout this kingdom it would very much confirm the doctrine I endea∣vour to confute and would be so contrary to that honour which reason justice and commonsense point out that I should not wonder if it inclined people to call in question the very existence of honour itself  The character of a Man of Honour as received in the  beau monde  is something so very singular that it deserves a particu∣lar  examination and though easier observed than described I shall endeavour to give my readers a description of it illus∣trated with some original pieces which have luckily fallen into my hands  A Man of Honour is one who peremptorily affirms himself to be so and who will cut any body's throat that questions it though on the best grounds he is infinitely above the restraints which the laws of God or man lay on vulgar minds and knows no other ties than those of Honour of which word he is to be the sole expounder He must strictly adhere to a party denomination though he may be utterly regardless of it's principles His expence should exceed his income conside∣rably not for the necessaries but for the superfluities of life that the debts he contracts may do him Honour There should be a haughtiness and insolence in his deportment which is sup∣posed to result from conscious Honour If he be cholerick and wrongheaded into the bargain with a good deal of animal courage he acquires the glorious character of a man of nice and jealous Honour and if all these qualifications are duly seasoned with the genteelest vices the Man of Honour is compleat any thing his wife children servants or tradesmen may think to the contrary notwithstanding  Belville is allowed to be a man of the most consummate Ho∣nour that this or any other age ever produced The men are proud of his acquaintance and the women of his protection his party glories in being countenanced by him and his Ho∣nour is frequently quoted as a sanction for their conduct But some original letters which I shall give my readers will let them more intimately into the particulars of so shining a cha∣racter than mere description would do  He had run out a considerable fortune by a life of pleasure particularly by gaming and being delicately scrupulous in points of Honour he writ the following letter to his attorney after an ill run at play  "SIR  "I HAD a damned tumble last night at hazard and must raise a thousand within a week get it me on any terms for I would rather suffer the greatest incumbrance on my fortune than the least blemish on my Honour As for those clamorous rascals the tradesmen insist on my privilege and keep them off as long as possible we may chance to ruin some of them be∣fore they can bring us to trial Your c  "TO MR GOOSETREE ATTORNEY IN FURNIVAL'S INN" "BELVILLE  But lest the endeavours of Mr Goosetree should prove in∣effectual Belville from the same principle of Honour re∣solved at all events to secure that sum collaterally and therefore wrote the following letter to the First Minister  "SIR  "I WAS applied to yesterday in your name by *** to vote for the great point which is to come into our House tomor∣row but as it was extremely contrary to my opinion and principles I gave him no explicit answer but took some time to consider of it I have therefore the honour now to acquaint you that I am determined to give my concurrence to this affair but must desire at the same time that you will imme∣diately send *** to me with the fifteen hundred pounds he offered me yesterday and for which I have a pressing occasion this morning I am persuaded you know me too well to scruple this payment beforehand and that you will not be the first person that ever questioned the Honour of Sir your most faithful humble servant  "BELVILLE"  I find another letter of the same date to a lady who appears to be the wife of his most intimate friend  "MY DEAR  "I HAVE just now received yours and am very sorry for the uneasiness your husband's behaviour has given you of late though I cannot be of your opinion that he suspects our con∣nection We have been bred up together from children and have lived in the strictest friendship ever since so that I dare say he would as soon suspect me of a design to murder as wrong him this way and you know it is to that considence and se∣curity of his that I owe the happiness that I enjoy However in all events be convinced that you are in the hands of a Man of Honour who will not suffer you to be ill used and should my friend proceed to any disagreeable extremities with you depend on it I'll cut the cuckold's throat for him Yours most tenderly  "B"  The fourth and last letter is to a friend who had probably as high notions of Honour as himself by the nature of the affair in which he requires his assistance  "DEAR CHARLES  "PR'YTHEE come to me immediately to serve me in an affair of Honour You must know I told a damned lye last night in a mixed company and a formal odd dog in a manner  insinuated that I did so on which I whispered him to be in Hyde Park this morning and to bring a friend with him if he had such a thing in the world The booby was hardly worth my resentment but you know my delicacy where Ho∣nour is concerned Yours  "BELVILLE"  It appears from these authentick pieces that Mr Belville filled with the noblest sentiments of Honour paid all debts but his just ones kept his word scrupulously in the flagitious sale of his conscience to a minister was ready to protect at the expence of his friend's life his friend's wife whom by the op∣portunities that friendship had given him he had corrupted and punished truth with death when it intimated however justly the want of it in himself  This person of refined Honour conscious of his own merit and virtue is a most unmerciful censor of the lesser vices and failings of others and lavishly bestows the epithets of Scoun∣drel and Rascal on all those who in a subordinate rank of life seem to aspire to any genteel degree of immorality An auk∣ward country gentleman who sells his silent vote cheap is with him a sad dog The industrious tradesmen are a pack of cheating rascals who should be better regulated and not suffered to impose on people of condition and servants are a parcel of idle scoundrels that ought to be used ill and not paid their wages in order to check their insolence  It is not to be imagined how pernicious the example of such a creature is to society he is admired and consequently imi∣tated he not only immediately corrupts his own circle of ac∣quaintance but the contagion spreads itself to infinity as circles in water produce one another though gradually less marked out in proportion as they are remoter from the cause of the first  To such practice and such examples in higher life may justly be imputed the general corruption and immorality which prevail through this kingdom but when such is the force of fashion and when the examples of people of the first rank in a country are so prevalent as to dignify vice and immorality in spite of all laws divine and human how popular might they make virtue if they would exert their power in it's cause And how must they in their cooler moments reproach them∣selves when they come to reflect that by their fatal examples they have beggared corrupted and it may be enslaved a whole nation  THE PLURALIST'S DINNER OR THE CURATE A MATCH FOR THE DEAN  A Dean of Canterbury remarkable for holding a great number of churchpreferments travelling slowly in his chariot to that city was overtaken by a poor parson who had procured the loan of a good horse The parson  en passant  bowed most respectfully to the dean who desiring him to stop begged he would call at the Mermaid at Rochester and order him a dinner to be ready at a certain hour The parson ac∣cordingly called on the host and told him that he would be honoured with a visit at such a time and must provide a good dinner "For how many and please your honour" says Boniface  "Why" replies the parson "I can't well say how many persons the whole company will consist of for I only saw the Dean of Canterbury the Canon of Winchester the Provost of Litchfield the Rector of Orpington the Vicar of Romney and one of the King's Chaplains"  The parson then proceeded to his own home which was within a few miles and the landlord began to make ample provision for the numerous guests he expected to entertain Accordingly when the Dean arrived a large table was spread and the cloth laid "How's this" cries his reverence "you have shewn me the wrong room This surely is in∣tended for a large company"  "And pleasure your honour" replied the landlord "Par∣son Singlechurch called about an hour and a half ago and told me I must provide for your honour and the Canon of Win∣chester and the Provost of Litchfield and the Rector of Or∣pington and one of the King's Chaplains too and I don't know how many more and so I thought and please your ho∣nour I'd get enough"  "Oh very well" coolly answered the dean who now re∣collected himself "I ought to have asked Mr Singlechurch to have staid and dined with me"  SPOILED CHILDREN A MIRROR FOR MOTHERS  I Am engaged in a visit at a friend's house in the country where I promised myself much satisfaction I have how∣ever been greatly disappointed in my expectations for on my arrival I found a house full of children who are  humoured  beyond measure and indeed absolutely spoiled by the ridicu∣lous  indulgence of a fond mother This unlucky circum∣stance has subjected me to many inconveniences and as I am a man of a grave reserved disposition has been a perpetual source of embarrassment and perplexity  The second day of my visit in the midst of dinner the eldest boy who is eight years old whipped off my perriwig with great dexterity and received the applause of the table for his humour and spirit This lad when he has reached his four∣teenth year and is big enough to lie without the maid is to be sent to a school in the neighbourhood which has no other merit than that of being but seven miles off Six of the chil∣dren are permitted to sit at table who entirely monopolize the wings of fowls and the most delicate morsels of every dish because the mother has discovered that her children have not  strong  stomachs  In the morning before my friend is up I generally take a turn on the gravelwalk where I could wish to enjoy my own thoughts without interruption but I am here instantly at∣tended by my little tormentors who follow me backwards and forwards and play at what they call  Running after the Gentle∣man  My whip which was a present from an old friend has been lashed to pieces by one of the boys who is fond of horses and the handle is turned into a hobbyhorse The mainspring of my repeatingwatch has been broke in the nursery which at the mother's request I had lent to the youngest boy who was just breeched and who cried to wear it  The mother's attention to the children entirely destroys all conversation and once as an amusement for the evenings we attempted to begin reading  Tom Jones  but were interrupted in the second page by little  Sammy  who is suffered to whip his top in the parlour I am known to be troubled with vio∣lent headaches notwithstanding which another of the boys without notice given or any regard paid to the company is permitted to break out into the brayings of an ass for which the strength of his lungs is commended and a little miss at breakfast is allowed to drink up all the cream and put her singers into the sugardish because she was once  sickly  I am teazed with familiarities which I can only repay with a frown and pestered with the petulance of ludicrous prattle in which I am unqualified to join It is whispered in the family that I am a mighty good sort of a man but that I cannot  talk to children  Nor am I the only person who suffers from this folly a neighbouring clergyman of great merit and modesty and much acquainted in the family has received hints to for∣bear coming to the house because little  Sukey  always cries  when she sees him and has told her mamma she can't bear that  ugly parson  Mrs Qualm my friend's wife the mother of this hopeful offspring is perpetually breeding or rather her whole existence is spent in a series of greatbellies lyingsin visitings church∣ings and christenings Every transaction of her life is dated from her several pregnancies The grandmother and the manmidwife a serious sensible man constantly reside in the house to be always ready on these solemn occasions She boasts that no family has ever sent out more numerous adver∣tisements for nurses  with a fine breast of milk  As her long∣ings have of late been in the vegetable way the garden is cultivated for this purpose alone and totally filled with forward peas and melonglasses in hopes that she may luckily long for what is at hand She preserves to the utmost the preroga∣tive of frequent pregnancy and conscious of the dignity and importance of being often  big  exerts an absolute authority over her husband He was once a keen foxhunter but has long ago dropped his hounds his wife having remonstrated that his early rising disturbed the family unseasonably and having dreamed that he broke his leg in leaping a ditch  I revere Mrs Qualm as the mother and only wish I could recommend her as the manager of children I hope this letter may fall into her hands to convince her how absurd it is to suppose that others can be as much interested in her own children as herself I would teach her that what I complain of as matter of inconvenience may one day prove to her a se∣vere trial and that early licentiousness will at last mock that parental affection from whose mistaken indulgence it arose  THE MISER'S MISTAKE OR ALL COVET ALL LOSE  A Miser having lost a hundred pounds promised ten pounds reward to any one who should bring it him An honest poor man who found it brought it to the old gentleman de∣manding the ten pounds But the miser to baffle him alledged there were a hundred and ten pounds in the bag when lost The poor man however was advised to sue for the money and when the cause came on to be tried it appearing that the seal had not been broken nor the bag ripped the judge said to the defendant's counsel"The bag you lost had a hundred and ten pounds in it you say""Yes my Lord" says he "Then" replied the judge "according to the evidence given in court this cannot be the money for here were only a hun∣dred pounds therefore the plaintiff must keep it till the true owner appears"  HUMOROUS DESCRIPTION OF A CITIZEN AND HIS FAMILY AT VAUXHALL  I Was greatly diverted last Saturday evening at Vauxhall with the shrewd remarks of an honest citizen whose wife and two daughters had prevailed on him to carry them to the Garden As I thought there was something curious in their behaviour I went into the next box to them where I had an opportunity of seeing and overhearing every thing that passed  After some talk" Come come" said the old don "it is time I think to go to supper" To this the ladies readily assented and one of the Misses said" Do let us have a chick papa"" Zounds" said the father "they are half a crown apiece and no bigger than a sparrow" Here the old lady took him up" You are so stingy Mr Rose there is no bear∣ing you When one is out upon pleasure I love to appear like somebody and what signifies a few shillings once and away when a body is about it" This reproof so effectually silenced the old gentleman that the youngest Miss had the courage to put in a word for some ham likewise The waiter was called and dispatched by the old lady with an order for a chicken and a plate of ham When it was brought our ho∣nest cit twirled the dish about three or four times and surveyed it with a very settled countenance then taking up a slice of ham and dangling it to and fro on the end of his fork asked the waiter how much there was of it "A shilling's worth Sir" said the fellow" Pr'ythee" said the don "how much dost think it weighs"" An ounce"" A shilling an ounce that is sixteen shillings per poundA reasonable pro∣fit trulyLet me seesuppose now the whole ham weighs thirty pounds at a shilling per ounce that is sixteen shillings per pound why your master makes exactly twentyfour pounds of every ham and if he buys them at the best hand and salts them and cures them himself they don't stand him in ten shillings apiece" The old lady bade him hold his nonsense declared herself ashamed for him and asked him if people must not live the taking a coloured handkerchief from her own neck she tucked it into his shirtcollar "whence it hung like a bid" and helped him to a leg of the chicken The old gen∣tleman at every bit he put into his mouth amused himself with saying" There goes twopenceThere goes threepence There goes a groat Zounds a man at these places should not have a swallow so wide as a tomtit"  This scanty repast we may imagine was soon dispatched and it was with much difficulty our citizen was prevailed on  to suffer a plate of beef to be ordered This too was no less admired and underwent the same comments with the ham At length when only a very small bit was left as they say for manners in the dish our don took a piece of an old newspaper out of his pocket and gravely wrapping up the meat in it placed it carefully in his lettercase "I'll keep thee as a curiosity to my dying day and I'll shew thee to my neighbour Horseman and ask him if he can make as much of his steaks" Then rubbing his hands and shrugging up his shoulders "Why now" says he "tomorrow night I may eat as much cold beef as I can stuff in any tavern in London and pay nothing for it" A dish of tarts cheesecakes and custards next made their appearance at the request of the young ladies who paid no sort of regard to the sather's remon∣strance that they were four times as dear as at the pastry∣cook's  Supper being ended Madam put her spouse in mind to call for wine "We must have some wine my dear or we shall not be looked upon you know""Well well" says the don "that's right enough But do they sell their liquor too by the ounceHere drawer what wine have you got" The fellow who by this time began to smoke his guests answered "We have exceeding good French wine of all sorts and please your honour Would your honour have a bottle of Champagne or Burgundy or Claret or" "No no none of your wishywashy outlandish rotgut for me" inter∣rupted the citizen "A tankard of the Alderman beats all the red Claret wine in the French king's cellarBut come bring us a bottle of sound old Port and d'ye hear let it be good"  While the waiter was gone the good man most sadly lament∣ed that he could not have his pipe which the wife would not allow because she said it was ungenteel to smoke where any ladies were in company When the wine came our citizen gravely took up the bottle and holding it above his head "Aye aye" said he "the bottom has had a good kickAnd mind how confoundedly it is pinched on the sidesNot above five gills I warrant An old soldier at the Jerusalem would beat two of them But let us see how it is brewed" He then poured out a glass and after holding it up before the candle smelling to it sipping it twice or thrice and smacking his lips drank it off but declaring that second thoughts were best he filled another bumper and tossing that off after some pause with a very important air ventured to pronounce it drinkable The ladies having also drank a glass round affirmed it was very good and felt warm in the stomach and even the old  gentleman relaxed into such good humour by the time the bottle was emptied that out of his own free will and motion he most generously called for another pint but charged the waiter to pick out an honest one  While the glass was thus circulating the family amused themselves with making observations on the Garden The citizen expressed his wonder at the number of lamps and said it must cost a great deal of money every night to light them all the eldest Miss declared that for her part she liked the dark walk best of all because it was solentary little Miss thought the last song mighty pretty and said she would buy it if she could but carry home the tune and the old lady ob∣served that there was a great deal of good company indeed but the gentlemen were so rude that they perfectly put her out of countenance by staring at her through their spyglasses In a word the tarts the cheesecakes the beef the chicken the ounce of ham and every thing seemed to have been quite for∣got till the dismal moment approached when the reckoning was called for As this solemn business concerns only the gen∣tlemen the ladies kept a profound silence and when the terri∣ble account was brought they left the paymaster undisturbed to enjoy the misery by himself only the old lady had the har∣diness to squint at the sumtotal and declared it was pretty rea∣sonable considering  Our citizen bore his misfortunes with a tolerable degree of patience He shook his head as he runover every article and swore he would never buy meat by the ounce again At length when he had carefully summed up every figure he bade the drawer bring change for sixpence then pulling out a leathern purse from a snug pocket in the inside of his waistcoat he drew out slowly piece by piece thirteen shillings which he regu∣larly placed in two rows on the table When the change was brought after counting it very carefully he laid down four half∣pence in the same exact order then calling the waiter "There" says he "there's your damagethirteen and two∣penceAnd hearkye there's threepence over for yourself" The remaining penny he put into his coatpocket and chinking it"This" says he "will serve me tomorrow to buy a paper of tobacco"  The family now prepared themselves for going and as there were some slight drops of rain Madam buttoned up the old gentleman's coat that he might not spoil his laced waistcoat and made him flap his hat over which she tied his pockethand∣kerchief to save his wig and as the coat itself she said had never been worn but three Sundays she even parted with her own cardinal and spread it the wrong side out over his shoul∣ders  In these accoutrements he sallied forth accompaned by his wife with her upperpetticoat thrown over her head and his daughters with the skirts of their gowns turned up and their heads muffled up in coloured handkerchiefs I followed them quite out of the garden and as they were waiting for their hack to draw up the youngest Miss asked"When shall we come again papa""Come again" said he "what a pox would you ruin me Once in one's life is enough and I think I have done very handsome Why it would not have cost me above fourpencehalfpenny to have spent my evening at Sot's Hole and what with the cursed coachhire and all together here's almost a pound gone and nothing to shew for it""Fie Mr Rose I'm quite ashamed for you" replies the old lady "You are always grudging me and your girls the least bit of pleasure and you cannot help grumbling if we do but go to Little Hornsey to drink tea I am sure now they are women grown up they ought to see a little of the world and they shall" The old don was not willing to pursue the argument any farther and the coach coming up he was glad to put an end to the dispute by saying"Come come let us make haste wife or we shall not get home time enough to have my best wig combed out again and tomorrow you know is Sunday"  COLLEY CIBBER'S WAGER  CIBBER was engaged in a paper war with Pope and be∣ing told one day that Pope intended to prosecute him for making too free with his character Cibber happened to be in a peevish temper and replied"He may kiss my arse" On this one of his friends who were all on the banter ob∣served that it was not language for a gentleman and that he was sure that Cibber would not dare say so to Pope's face"By God Sir" says Colley "I would tell him so or any puppy that should take his part"This assertion was what they were fishing for as they now perceived that he was in a right cue to be worked up to any pitch And so it proved for before they parted they provoked him to a bett of one hun∣dred guineas that he would bid Pope kiss his arse in the pub∣lick playhouse bid the company he sat with kiss his arse let them be who they would bid box pit and gallery separately kiss his arse likewise and in conclusion bid the whole house kiss his arse all together This mad wager soon got wind and it was generally known that Pope was to be at the play the next night When the time came the house was crouded Now as it was the beginning of term the solicitor and attor∣neygeneral  were both in the stagebox according to an an∣cient custom and who should be perched plump between them but Alexander the Little Well Colley had bought the collar and he was resolved to go through with it so just as the last musick was playing and the curtain ready to be drawn up he rang the bell and pushed boldly on the stage Cibber bowed the house clapped he bowed again all was atten∣tion and thus he began"Ladies and gentlemen I have a story to tell you to which if you do not honour me with an in∣dulgent hearing I shall lose one hundred guineas" On this a universal clap ensued and a general cry of"The story The story" He then proceeded thus"You must know ladies and gentlemen that there lived in this city an honest old tren∣chermaker who had saved a very considerable fortune and having two sons called Kill 'em All and Kiss my Arse he left all his landed estate to his eldest son Kill 'em All and all his bu∣siness and stock in trade to his youngest son Kiss my Arse Now it happened ladies and gentlemen that Kill 'em All in a few years prodigally spent his patrimony and what does he do but set up his business of trenchermaking directly under the nose of his brother Kiss my Arse It is an old saying that two of a trade can never agree and I am sure it is a true one for no sooner was this opposition began than the two brothers began to hate the sight of each other so that if they both chanced to be at the play on the same night you would see Kill 'em All in the pit and Kiss my Arse in the gallery or else Kill 'em All in the gallery and Kiss my Arse in the pit Indeed sometimes you might see Kill 'em All in the pit or gallery and Kiss my Arse in the boxes By and by they got into a paper war but as neither of them could write them∣selves they employed scribblers on each side to do it for them so Kill 'em All chose your humble servant and Kiss my Arse Mr Pope" bowing to him "Soon after the commence∣ment of the paper war they went to law with each other about defamation Kill 'em All chose for counsel the Solici∣torGeneral and Kiss my Arse Mr AttorneyGeneral no I mistake Kill 'em All chose the AttorneyGeneral and Kiss my Arse Mr Solicitor" bowing occasionally to both "At last by the interposition of friends they agreed to submit to an arbitration and then it was finally settled that to obviate all subsequent disputes Kill 'em All's trenchers should for the future be made all square and those of Kiss my Arse all round"  This piece of humour was received with great applause and Cibber fairly won his wager  POLITENESS OR THE CATO'NINETAILS A TALE  BY MR JOHN MARTIN  ONCE on a time as I've heard say  I neither know the year nor day  The rain distill'd from many a cloud  The night was dark the wind blew loud  A country squire without a guide  Where roads were bad and heath was wide  Attended by his servant Jerry  Was travelling tow'rds the town of Bury  The squire had ne'er been bred in courts  And yet was held as fame reports  Though he to wit made no pretence  A squire of more than common sense  Jerry who courage could not boast  Thought every sheep he saw a ghost  And most devoutly pray'd he might  Escape the terrors of that night  As they approach'd the common's side  A peasant's cottage they espied  There riding up our weary squire  Held it most prudent to enquire  Being nothing less than wet to skin  Where he might find a wholesome inn  "No inns there are" replied the clown  "'Twixt this and yonder markettown  Seven miles Norwest across the heath  And wind and rain are in your teeth  But if so be Sir you will go  To yon old hall upon the brow  You'll find free entertainment there  Down beds and rare old English fare  Of beef and mutton fowl and fish  As good as any man need wish  Warm stabling too and corn and hay  Yet not a penny will you pay  'Tis true Sir I have heard it said"  And here he grinn'd and scratch'd his head  "The gentleman that keeps the house  Though ev'ry freedom he allows  And is o'ernight so woundy civil  You'd swear he never dreamt of evil  Orders next morn his servant John  With cato'ninetails to lay on  Full twenty strokes most duly counted  On man and master ere they're mounted"  "With cato'ninetails Oh" cried Jerry  "That I were safe at Edmund's Bury"  Our squire spurr'd on as clown directed  This offer might not be rejected  Poor Jerry's pray'rs could not dissuade  The squire more curious than afraid  Arrives and rings the footman runs  The master with his wife and sons  Descend the hall and bid him enter  Give him dry cloaths and beg he'll venture  To take a glass of Coniack brandy  And he who hated words to bandy  In idle compliment'ry speeches  The brandy took and eke the breeches  The liquor drank the garments chang'd  The family round the fire arrang'd  The mistress begg'd to know if he  Chose coffee chocolate or tea  The squire replied sans hesitation  Or teazing trite expostulation  "A dish of coffee and a toast"  The mistress smil'd th' enraptur'd host  Cried"Sir I like your frankness much  This house is yours pray think it such  While here you stay 'tis my request  And you shall be a welcome guest  Sans ceremony I would live  And what I have I freely give"  Tea ended once again our host  Demanded"Sir of boil'd or roast  Fish flesh or fowl do you prefer  For supper""Why indeed good Sir  Roast duck I love""With good green pease"  Yes dearest Madam if you please"  "Well said Now while it's getting ready  We two my eldest son and lady  Will take a hand at Whist""Agreed"  And soon they cut for deal and lead  But now to crimp my lengthen'd tale  Whether the squire drank wine or ale  Or how he slept or what he said  Or how much gave to man or maid  Or what the while became of Jerry  'Mong footmen blithe and maidens merry  Description here we can't admit  For "brevity's the soul of wit"  Suffice to say the morn arriv'd  Jerry of senses half depriv'd  Horses from stable saw led out  Trembled and skulk'd and peer'd about  And felt already ev'ry thwack  Of cato'ninetails on his back  Each word each action was a blunder  But O how great his joy and wonder  The stirrups held the horses cross'd  When forth the hostess and the host  With smiles instead of lashes smarting  Came out to take a cup at parting  Bestowing a thousand welcomes on 'em  Unfeign'd for all the honour done 'em  Of thanks what language could afford  Of cato'ninetails not one word  Mutual civilities repaid  The squire had turn'd his horse's head  To gallop off yet his desire  Grew ev'ry moment higher and higher  While bidding thus his last adieu  To ask if what he'd heard were true  For not alone the clown had said  The reckoning must in stripes be paid  But one o'th' footmen whom he slily  O'er night interrogated drily  Confirm'd the aforesaid peasant's tale  And said his master would not fail  Next morn to bid in furious passion  Strong John lay twenty times the lash on  Determin'd then to ease his doubt  E'en though it bred a flogging bout  Of that howe'er to be sincere  He was not very much in fear  Once more he turn'd his horse's head  And to his host thus smiling said  "Last night a peasant told me here  As I have found was noble cheer  But added ere this morn I went  You'd drub me to my heart's content  Yet this you have not put in act  Is it a fiction or a fact  After the kindness you've express'd  You take your leave thus of each guest  And how if still a rule you've kept it  Have I deserv'd to be excepted"  "Sir" answer'd he "'tis very true  No stranger e'er went hence but you  Who bore not on his well carv'd bark  Of cato'ninetails many a mark  None yet deserv'd or I'm mistaken  That I should spare the blockhead's bacon  A set of tiresome troublesome knaves  Of bowing fawning lying slaves  If a man ask'd what they'd prefer  "Oh I love any thing good Sir"  Would you chuse coffee Sir or tea  "Dear Ma'am it's all the same to me"  For beef or mutton give your voice  "Upon my honour I've no choice"  There's Cheshire Sir and Gloster cheese  Which shall I send you"Which you please"  Curse on their cringing complaisance  I've tutor'd some of them to dance  Such steps as they ne'er learn'd in France  But you good Sir or I misdeem  Deserve an honest man's esteem  Your frankness Sir I call polite  I never sp  nt a happier night  And whensoe'er this road you come  I hope you'll make my house your home  Nay more I likewise hope henceforth  To rank a man of so much worth  Among my friends""Sir" said the squire  "'Tis what I ardently desire  Not twenty miles from hence my house  At which your sons yourself and spouse  Shall find such hospitality  As kindly here you've shewn to me"  The bargain struck the squire and Jerry  Again proceed for town of Bury  And now the reader may with ease  Extract this moral if he please  Politeness cannot e'er become  Impertinent and troublesome  His breeding good he soonest proves  Who soonest tells you what he loves  And who in rapid eloquence  Their wordy compliments dispense  Have more civility than sense  THE CIT'S COUNTRY BOX  BY MR ROBERT LLOYD  THE wealthy cit grown old in trade  Now wishes for the rural shade  And buckles to his onehorse chair  Old Dobbin or the founder'd mare  While wedg'd in closely by his side  Sits Madam his unwieldy bride  With Jacky on a stool before 'em  And out they jog in due decorum  Scarce past the turnpike half a mile  "How all the country seems to smile"  And as they slowly jog together  The cit commends the road and weather  While Madam doats upon the trees  And longs for ev'ry house she sees  Admires it's views and situation  And thus she opens her oration  "What signifies the loads of wealth  Without the richest jewel health  Excuse the fondness of a wife  Who doats upon your precious life  Such ceaseless toil such constant care  Is more than human strength can bear  One may observe it in your face  Indeed my dear you break apace  And nothing can your health repair  But exercise and country air  Sir Traffick has a house you know  About a mile from Cheny Row  He's a good man indeed 'tis true  But not so warm my dear as you  And folks are always apt to sneer  One would not be outdone my dear"  Sir Traffick's name so well applied  Awak'd his brother merchant's pride  And Thrifty who had all his life  Paid utmost deference to his wife  Confess'd her arguments had reason  And by th' approaching summer season  Draws a few hundreds from the stocks  And purchases his CountryBox  Some three or four miles out of town  An hour's ride will bring you down  He fixes on his choice abode  Not half a furlong from the road  And so convenient does it lay  The stages pass it ev'ry day  And then so snug so mighty pretty  To have a house so near the city  Take but your places at the Boar  You're set down at the very door  Well then suppose them fix'd at last  Whitewashing painting scrubbing past  Hugging themselves in ease and clover  With all the fuss of moving over  Lo a new heap of whims are bred  And wanton in my lady's head  "Well to be sure it must be own'd▪  It is a charming spot of

Objects continual passing by  Were something to amuse the eye  But to be pent within the walls  One might as well be at St Paul's  Our house beholders would adore  Was there a level lawn before  Nothing it's views to incommode  But quite laid open to the road  While ev'ry trav'ller in amaze  Should on our little mansion gaze  And pointing to the choice retreat  Cry"That's Sir Thrifty's

A ditch of water four feet wide  With angles curves and zigzag lines  From Halfpenny's exact designs  In front a level lawn is seen  Without a shrub upon the green  Where Taste would want it's first

COLLINGS  ROUGH as his native clods to town  Young Bruin came a country clown  His hair that still defied the comb  Stood like the bristles of a broom▪  His coat of cut behind before  The same as that his father wore  Was honest drab of Yorkshire growth  With brazen buttons and so forth  The cuffs pull'd lower down betray'd  How worldly beauty blooms to fade  His buckskin short and eke too strait  His toes turn'd in a slouching gait  With hobnails fortified his feet  He struck a light along the street  Now station'd at a Ludgate door  The Natty Prig succeeds the Boor  Like spigot in a cask of beer  The dawnings of a tail appear  His locks with many a fiery twirl  Assume a kind of stubborn curl  He cleans his teeth collects a grin  While frequent soap manures his chin  To angle ninety strains his feet  And geometrick trips the street  Lest stockings white receive a smear  And none but worsted else to wear  Now soon as shut his evening shop  He figures at a halfcrown hop  The ladies leeringwell they may  To see him wriggle it away  For sure their little hearts must warm  At so much youth with such a form  "What sinewy legs and thighsO lack  And what a lovely breadth of back"  Now vegetates a nobler tail  Of substance like his father's flail  While flakes of powder down his waist  Bespeak the man of growing taste  His frock Balloon or Emperor's eye  With narrow skirts and collar high  A button like a fullfac'd moon  Succeeds the coat of Yorkshire brown  And now he struts among the belles  At Dog and Duck or Bagnigge Wells  In boots perhaps to hide the dirt  And justify a coarser shirt  Or as more Cynick bards suppose  With stockings torn and want of shoes  But no such reasons I adduce  Th' equestrian is a dress of use  Where folks may see or think they see  Me and my horse my horse and me  His hat abridg'd from cock'd to round  With velvet band and velvetbound  Shall live that fashion on the wane  To be perhaps a square again  With golden girdle and cockade  Though hat decay and binding fade  And now the finish'd youth aspires  To breathe a critick's nobler fires  The playhouse his nocturnal hobby  A halfprice lounger in the lobby  He damns by proxy o'er his chop  At Jupp's or Merry field's old shop  A piece at which he ne'er appear'd  Or hawks the song he never heard  And still to whores and knaves submits  Presuming on the fate of wits  Till all his pence reduc'd to pills  His threadbare dress to doctor's bills  A dupe to those and these unpaid  The prodigal returns to trade  Abjures the vanities of life  And makes some ruin'd girl his wife  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS PLATE VIII  The Industrious Prentice grown rich Sheriff of London  THE COMICK MAGAZINE  NUMBER VIII  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE VIII THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE GROWN RICH AND SHERIFF OF LONDON  WHILE the pursuits of Thomas Idle the vicious Appren∣tice are conducting him to ignominy and disgrace Francis Goodchild by perseverance in virtuous and industri∣ous habits acquires opulence and fame which render him an object of his fellowcitizens notice and elevate him to the honour of being chosen Sheriff of London  In this character the present Print exhibits him seated at the festive table in Guildhall  Hogarth here gives us a good general idea of a cityfeast The principals that they might be separated as much as possi∣ble from the burlesque of the scene are judiciously kept in the background The minutest figures however are charac∣teristically delineated though the female dresses in particular are now become obsolete The glutton Time swallows nothing with more voracious expedition than Fashion she alone af∣fords him a continual feast  The group in the foreground on the left is admirably brought forward  The figure gnawing a bone with a napkin tucked under his chin the fat citizen by his side with a napkin in his button∣hole whose eagernes  once to carve and to eat seems to have made him take too  amouthful the meagre and sicklylooking  picture of Famine in a black wig seated next by way of contrast and languidly holding his spoon which he seems scarcely able to heave the winebibber on the other side the soupswallowing divine said to be a French clergyman named Patell and once curate of Barnet and the two side faces both with loaded forks but of characters widely different form all together a very forcible display of civick gluttony  While the cooks are busily engaged in bringing new supplies for the mouth the musicians in an elevated gallery are still more actively employed in regaling the citizens ear  That part of the hall which is comprehended in this print displays the wholelength figures of King William the Third the heroick Sir William Walworth who killed Wat Tyler in Smithfield and one of the many Judges whose pictures cover the walls  In the midst of festive scene however Hogarth has intro∣duced at the right corner of the Print a morose Beadle with all the consequential insolence of a beggar in office holding up and reading a letter directed to Francis Goodchild Esq Sheriff of London while at the bar among other figures there ap∣pears a straithaired culprit whose humble simplicity presents a very forcible contrast It naturally reminds us of Shak∣speare's  "Insolence of office and the spurns  Which patient merit of th' unworthy takes"  The Motto to this Print though perhaps not the most happi∣ly chosen being from the wisest of men can hardly fail to be good  "With all thy gettings get understanding Exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her"  PROVERBS iv  GOOD BLOOD OR THE DOCTOR'S MISTAKE AN HIBERNIAN REPARTEE  AN Irish fishwoman who was accustomed to charge her veins rather too freely with her favourite whisky having been one day blooded the apothecary told her that her blood was very bad "By Jasus" says she "Mr Doctor but it is a great big lye for I was always reckoned to have the best blood of any woman in the parish"  THE ART OF EARTICKLING  HUMAN nature though every where the same is so seem∣ingly diversified by the various habits and customs of dif∣ferent countries and so blended with the early impressions we receive from our education that they are often confounded to∣gether and mistaken for one another This makes us look with astonishment upon all customs that are extremely different from our own and hardly allow those nations to be of the same nature with ourselves if they are unlike us in their man∣ners whereas all human actions may be traced up to these two great motives the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain and upon a strict examination we shall often find that those customs which at first view seem the most different from our own have in reality a great analogy with them  What more particularly suggested this thought to me was an account which a gentleman who was lately returned from China gave in a company where I happened to be present of a pleasure held in high esteem and extremely practised by that luxurious nation He told us that the Tickling of the Ears was one of the most exquisite sensations known in China and that the delight administered to the whole frame through this organ could by an able and skilful Tickler be raised to whatever degree of extasy the patient should desire  The company struck with this novelty expressed their sur∣prize as is usual on such occasions first by a silly silence and then by many silly questions The account too coming so far as from China raised both their wonder and their curiosity much more than if it had come from any European country and opened a larger field for pertinent questions Among others the gentleman was asked whether the Chinese ears and fingers had the least resemblance to ours to which having answered in the affirmative he went on thus "I peceive I have excited your curiosity so much by mentioning a custom unknown to you here that I believe it will not be disagreeable if I give you a particular account of it  "This pleasure strange as it may seem to you is in China reckoned almost equal to any that the senses afford There is not an ear in the whole country untickled and the Ticklers have in their turn others who tickle them insomuch that there is a circulation of Tickling throughout that vast empire And if by chance there be some few unhappy enough not to find Ticklers or some Ticklers clumsy enough not to find business they comfort themselves at least with selftitillation  "This profession is one of the most lucrative and consider∣able ones in China the most eminent performers being either  handsomely requited in money or still better rewarded by the credit and influence it gives them with the party tickled insomuch that a man's fortune is made as soon as he gets to be Tickler to any considerable Mandarine  "The Emperor as in justice he ought enjoys this plea∣sure in it's highest perfection and all the considerable people contend for the honour and advantage of this employment the person who succeeds the best in it being always the first favourite and chief dispenser of his imperial power The principal Mandarines are allowed to try their hands upon his Majesty's sacred ears and according to their dexterity and agility com∣monly rise to the posts of first ministers His wives too are admitted to try their skill and she among them who holds him by the ear is teckoned to have the surest and most lasting hold His present imperial Majesty's ears as I am informed are by no means of a delicate texture and consequently not quick of sensation so that it has proved extremely difficult to nick the tone of them the lightest and finest hands have urterly failed and many have miscarried who from either fear or respect did not treat the royal ears so roughly as was necessary He began his reign under the hands of a bungling operator who for his clumsiness he soon dismiffed he was afterwards attempted by a more skilful Tickler but he sometimes failed too and not being able to hit the humour of his majesty's ears his own have often suffered for it  "In this publick distress and while majesty laboured under the privation of auricular joys the Empress who by long ac∣quaintance and frequent little trials judged pretty well of the texture of the royal ear resolved to undertake it and suc∣ceeded perfectly by means of a much stronger friction than others durst either attempt or could imagine would please  "In the mean time the skilful Mandarine far from being discouraged by the ill success he had sometimes met with in his attempts upon the Emperor's ears resolved to make himself amends upon his imperial consort's he tried and he pre∣vailed he tickled her majesty's ear with such perfection that as the Emperor would trust his ear to none but the Empress she would trust her's to none but this lightfingered Mandarine who by these means attained to unbounded and uncontrouled power and governed ear by ear  "But as all the Mandarines have their EarTicklers too with the same degree of influence over them and as this Man∣darine was particularly remarkable for his extreme sensibility in those parts it is hard to say from what original titillation the imperial power now flows"  The conclusion of the gentleman's story was attended with  the usual interjections of wonder and surprize from the com∣pany some called it strange some odd and some very comi∣cal and those who thought it the most improbable I found by their questions were the most desirous to believe it I ob∣served too that while the story lasted they were most of them trying the experiment upon their own ears but without any visible effect that I could perceive  Soon afterwards the company broke up and I went home where I could not help reflecting with some degree of wonder on the wonder of the rest because I could see nothing extra∣ordinary in the power which the ear exercised in China when I considered the extensive influence of that important organ in Europe Here as in China it is the source of both pleasure and power the manner of applying it is only different Here the titillation is vocal there it is manual but the effects are the same and by the bye European ears are not always un∣acquainted neither with manual applications  To make out the analogy I hinted at between the Chinese and ourselves in this particular I will offer to my readers some instances of the sensibility and prevalency of the ears of Great Britain  The British ears seem to be as greedy and sensible of titil∣lation as the Chinese can possibly be nor is the profession of an EarTickler here any ways inferior or less lucrative There are three sorts the Private Tickler the Publick Tickler and the SelfTickler  Flatrery is of of all methods the surest to produce that vi∣bration of the air which affects the auditory nerves with the most exquisite titillation and according to the thinner or thicker texture of those organs the flattery must be more or less strong This is the immediate province of the Private Tickler and his great skill consists in tuning his flattery to the ear of his patient it were endless to give instances of the in∣fluence and advantages of those artists who excel in this way  The business of a Publick Tickler is to modulate his voice dispose his matter and enforce his arguments in such a man∣ner as to excite a pleasing sensation in the ears of a number or assembly of people this is the most difficult branch of the profession and that in which the fewest excel but to the few who do it is the most lucrative and the most considerable The bar has at present few proficients of this sort the pulpit none the ladder alone seems not to decline  The SelfTickler is as unhappy as contemptible for hav∣ing none of the talents necessary for tickling of others and consequently not worth being tickled by others neither he is reduced to tickle himself his own ears alone receive any titil∣lation  from his own efforts I know an eminent performer of this kind who by being nearly related to a skilful publick Tickler would fain set up for the business himself but has met with such repeated discouragements that he is reduced to the mortifying resource of selftitillation in which he commit  the most horrid excesses  Besides the proofs abovementioned of the influence of the ear in this country many of our most common phrases and ex∣pressions from whence the genius of a people may always be collecteddemonstrate that the ear is reckoned the principal and most predominant part of our whole mechanism To have the ear of one's prince is understood by every body to mean the having a good share of his authority if not the whole which plainly hints how that influence is acquired  To have the ear of the first minister is the next if not an equal advantage I am therefore not surprized that so con∣siderable a possession should be so frequently attempted and so eagerly solicited as we may always observe it is But I must caution the person who would make his fortune in this way to confine his attempt strictly to the ear in the singular number a design upon the ears in the plural of a first minister being for the most part rather difficult and dangerous however just  To give ear to a person implies giving credit being con∣vinced and being guided by that person and all this by the success of his endeavours upon that prevailing organ  To lend an ear is something less but still intimates a will∣ingness and tendency in the lender to be prevailed upon by a little more tickling of that part Thus the lending of an ear is a sure presage of success to a skilful Tickler For example a person who lends an ear to a minister seldom fails of putting them both in his power soon afterwards and when a fine wo∣man lends an ear to a lover she shews a disposition at least to farther and future titillation  To be deaf and stop one's ears are common and known ex∣pressions to signify a total refusal and rejection of a person or proposition in which case I have often observed the manual application to succeed by a strong vellication or vigorous per∣cussion of the outward membranes of the ear  There cannot be a stronger instance of the great value that has always been set upon these parts than the constant manner of expressing the utmost and most ardent desire people can have for any thing by saying they would give their ears for it a price so great that it is seldom either paid or required wit∣ness the numbers of people actually wearing their ears still who in justice have long since forfeited them  Over head and ears would be a manifest pleonasmus the head being higher than the ears were not the ears reckoned  so much more valuable than all the rest of the head as to make it a true climax  It were unnecessary to mention as farther proofs of the im∣portance and dignity of those organs that pulling boxing or cutting off the ears are the highest insults that cholerick men of honour can either give or receive which shews that the ear is the seat of honour as well as of pleasure  The anatomists have discovered that there is an intimate correspondence between the palm of the hand and the ear and that a previous application to the hand communicates itself in∣stantly by the force and velocity of attraction to the ear and agreeably prepares that part to receive and admit of titillation I must say too that I have known this practised with success upon very considerable persons of both sexes  Having thus demonstrated by many instances that the ear is the most material part in the whole mechanism of our struc∣ture and that it is both the seat and source of honour power pleasure and pain I cannot conclude without an earnest ex∣hortation to all my countryfolks of whatsoever rank or sex to take the utmost care of their ears Guard your ears O ye princes for your power is lodged in your earsGuard your ears ye nobles for your honour lies in your earsGuard your ears ye fair if you would guard your virtueAnd guard your ears all my fellowsubjects if you would guard your liberties and properties  THE NINE LIVES OF A CAT  BY BONNEL THRONTON ESQ  "HE has as many Lives as a Cat" said a gentleman the other day in company speaking of his friend who had run through a perpetual course of riot and debauchery and had just recovered from a violent fever occasioned by his intem∣perance The thought struck me that too many indeed seem to be as regardless of their present existence as if they imagined they could die more than once I pursued my thought still farther and concluded that the greatest part of mankind were they even possessed of as many Lives we will say as a Cat would be indifferent to them all at least they would wantonly throw away the eight however careful and studious some of them might be to preserve the last  Suppose a man then to have as many Lives as a Cat let us see what glorious use he would make of this extraordinary privilege Must it not be a great incitement to him to ha∣zard them repeatedly upon honourable and virtuous occasions I grant it and it must likewise be granted to me that they  would equally be lavished away upon trivial dishonourable and wicked occasions  Alexander had he had nine times Nine Lives to lose would have risqued every jot of them to conquer as many worlds Let me ask whether the King of Prussia or the Marquis of Granby would not as chearfully run the same hazard But would and O that Englishmen could not fill the blanks up have done the same Perhaps they might have ventured some portion of their precious Lives perhaps they might have poured out some part of the vapid mixture drop by drop still careful of the last dregs they perhaps like the miser who plays for gain might have been tempted to stake a little of their fortune but could never have been prevailed on like the bold and generous gamester to throw for the whole They in fine would scarcely have set to borrow an expression of Shakespeare "even one of their Nine Lives on the hazard of the die"  On the other side let us take a view of these brethren of the blade to whom the one Life which is sparingly bestowed on us mortals seems scarce worth the having I suppose it to appear so to them from their readiness to resign it themselves or to take it away from others upon any occasion or if you will in the Hibernian phrase upon no occasion at all One instance shall serve for all Suppose there are eighteen Lives between us I tread upon your toe satisfaction is demanded and is honourably given by your firing at my brains which are missed We have Lives enough to spare and you have a nose lest for me to pull I handle it in consequence I fire at your brains and cannot hit them What then is to be done Why nothing is to be done only you are to kick me that is all I turn about draw my sword and like men of ho∣nour we must each of us lose one of our Nine Lives before we part friends I am indeed sensible that the punctilios of nice honour would induce the professors of it to ask this gen∣manlike question before the engagement"Pray Sir how many Lives have you to lose" And there is no doubt upon a disparity that the seconds would take care that the princi∣pals should be so far upon an equality that the longesttobeliver should be first put to death as often as was ne∣cessary till the combatants were in that respect at par  It must undoubtedly be allowed me where the antago∣nists are equal or made equal by the foregoing method that one or other of the parties would Nine times kill or Nine times be killed provided he has reason to cry out with Othello  "Though all his hairs were Lives  My great revenge has stomach for them all"  The bravery of a man fighting a duel with himself without second or antagonist vulgarly called selfmurder is frequently manifested even in our present state of existence where we have but one Life to lose It must therefore be granted on the supposition of our Lives being multiplied to Nine that sui∣cide would become a general fashion among us though in eight instances out of Nine it would betray a meanness of spirit We should never be induced to believe a man was tired of himself in real earnest though he had got rid of himself ever so often except he fairly sent himself out of the world for the Ninth and last time  Let us suppose for instance that a man of quality has  ad a run of illluck at the hazardtable to be sure he would shoot himself through the head directly Upon his reviving he tries his fortune a second time and is reduced to the necessity of running himself through the heart After his recovery he is obliged repeatedly to make use of the same or other methods that the losses of his Lives may be even with the losses of his estate Would not this unhasty behaviour shew a love for his precious Lives since he would not put an end to all Nine of them directly one after another  To prove such behaviour to be quite mean and vulgar let us farther suppose that a cobler jerks his awl up between the third and fourth ribI kill my heroes with the same precision as is used by Homera barber takes a clean stroke just under the chin a taylor "makes his quietus with a bare bodkin" I shall have my shoes heelpieced my beard shaved and my doublet mended notwithstanding The allusion is too obvi∣ous about the end and the last but I hope to be indulged on this subject in considering my taylor not without propriety as only the Ninth part of a man  Many many instances might be thought of to evince that a man endowed with the Lives of a Cat would get quit of the incumbrance of supernumerary ones as fast as possible Take a lover for example without a metaphor he would be so much enamoured as literally to die many times for the same or some other mistress We will suppose what is mere supposition a constant enamoratoupon the least flight or in∣difference such as a frown or a box on the ear my swain hur∣ries away to Rosamond's Pond after drowning he rises up to∣lerably cooled On another occasion he surveys the trees in the Dark Walk at Vauxhall picks out a stout branch and with the leisure of your true lover's melancholy unties his garters at the last he tucks himself up and dangles till a hap∣py pair comes in his way and he is cut down The lady after all this proof of his affection is still stony hearted He dies  and dies on for her and having put himself out of eight of his existences can he be blamed if he reserves the precious one still remaining for a beauty or a fortune or a woman of qualityor his maid  Suppose again for there can be no end of suchlike suppo∣sitions that I am an author my works indeed I flatter my∣self will live after me but though I had all the Lives of a Cat through each of them I might lead the life of a dog My garret we will say has inspired me to soar so high as to attempt a sublime ode or epick poem I am let down by it's want of sale The beam across my chamber is very inviting and at least the bedcords are remaining I am afterwards lowered to humble prose My publisher will not afford me smallbeer and I chuse to have my fill of water by a plunge into the River Thames After sinking and soaring for eight times alternate∣ly I at last sit down contented in a gaol to supply copy scrap by scrap as the printer's little imp calls for it since as the proverb has it "he must needs go whom the Devil drives"  I shall say very little of the bold methods which bucks and bloods would take delight in to shorten their Lives were they ever so many for these are obvious and continually practised even in the present narrow space of their existence How often would a choice spirit for example be literally dead drunk Would he scruple to lay his Lives down one after the other under the table as long as he could be certain he should rise up and stand upon his legs again The debauchee of every character would doubtless be as hasty to get rid of his load of Lives as he is at present neglectful in preserving his single one  Upon this principle of each individual enjoying a multipli∣city of Lives let us farther consider how a nation or society or community of them might exist It may I know be urged that Fielding himself and all the sitting aldermen put together would not be sufficient to support the police A man you will say would risque being hanged eight different times for eight different capital offences resolving to be very honest afterwards for the remainder of his Lives Granted But in such a case it is most probable that the wisdom of the legisla∣ture would direct that a convict should be sentenced to be hanged like a Cat till he were dead dead dead dead dead dead dead dead dead  I went to bed after having written thus far reflecting that no man should be entitled to a second existenceI mean in our mortal statewithout having made a proper use of the first This reflection was so strongly impressed upon my  mind that T'was able to employ the succeeding morning in set∣ting down the particulars of a dream occasioned by it  I imagined that every one was indulged with a privilege after death of having his existence renewed but with this restriction that he could prove that he had not forfeited his former Life by not setting a proper value on it I accordingly conceived myself in a sort of court of claims where a number of us were brought by Death in order to be examined about our pretensions to be revivified The sight of the crowd struck me with horror some appeared to be covered with blains and blotches some quite emaciated and some with bloated carcases One bore the marks of a tight knot under the left ear another had his scull shattered to pieces and an∣other had a great gash in his side Milton's description of a lazarhouse falls far short of what I then thought I saw  Truth and Justice were the examinants and the candidates for a new life underwent a strict scrutiny The first that I ob∣served was called before them stepped up with a bold air and claimed a new existence on account of his having died for his country The plea was not approved of for a common sol∣dier who had fallen in the same battle deposed that he him∣self shot him in an engagement where the enemy was inferior at the instant that this commander had ordered a retreat The soldier was directly reinstated into Life  A jolly personage was next examined and he pretended that he was accidentally choaked by a turtlefin though the news∣papers had falsely attributed his death to an apoplectick sit It being proved upon him that he had dined the day before and eat heartily upon turbot and venison and that he had drank plentifully of old hock and claret the court  ecreed that he died of a surfeit and refused to indulge him in any more good living  A mere skeleton crawled up next and declared that he only wished to be made alive again for the service of the fair sex From his examination it was manifest that he had spent his life in and about CoventGarden He was adjudged upon his own plea unfit to exist again  The next was an old decrepid figure seemingly worn down with age and cares His  uit for the renewal of his Life was in compassion to him rejected because it plainly appeared that he had already dragged out a most miserable one and had actually died of want in the midst of abundance His son put in a petition for his reexistence at the very same time setting forth that he was reduced by the mean spirit of his father to die an untimely death at Tyburn The compassion of the court in not suffering him to live again was also extended to  the young gentleman on account of his tender years there being little doubt but that he would come to the same untimely end let his Lives be renewed ever so often  A blunt young fellow not less than six feet high next in∣sisted upon being restored to Life Another of the same make and for the same reason insisted upon the like They had each of them in the honourable way put each other to death It was determined upon hearing both parties separately that neither of them should run the risque of being put to death again as neither of them would allow that the other deserved to live  A horrid spectacle next presented itself he most earnestly requested to enjoy again that being which he confessed he had rashly and desperately got rid of His request was not grant∣ed because it was certain that the same would be repeated upon the slightest occasion  I observed in imagination even some ladies of quality who wished to have their beauty renewed together with their Lives most of them had died at publick places where they went for the recovery of their health  My dream was put an end to all of a sudden by being my∣self summoned up to give a reason why I should be glad to exist again I pleaded guilty and awaked upon sentence being pro∣nounced that I should starve again as an author  A MODERN JUSTICE OF PEACE DRAWN FROM THE LIFE  "Pray send me the Ax re Latin to Augustus Peas"  MY motto is a true and genuine specimen of the profound learning of a modern Justice and to whom Shak∣speare's Shallow was not fit to hold a candle it was an order from one of that learned body to his bookseller to send him the acts relating to a Justice of Peace and doth sufficiently display his capacity of judging of the laws and deciding the diffe∣rences and disputes among his Majesty's good subjects And there can be I think no doubt but as soon as he got the Ax he hewed the laws with wonderful skill and ability How many such worshipful magistrates there are in the kingdom I can∣not pretend to say but whoever will look back for thirty years past will confess that there hath within that time been a very extraordinary alteration in the general justiceship of this kingdom  Gentlemen of honour and fortune in their several counties used to be appointed and thought it no disgrace to act as  Justices but since faction hath shed it's baneful inflúence and every thing hath been carried by the current of corruption since partyzeal and a ready subserviency to ministerial mea∣sures have been thought the most necessary qualifications for a magistrate and since a lower set of people as being pro∣perest for such sinister purposes have been advanced to the seat of justice gentlemen of honour and fortune have in general not caring for such work or such company declined acting And it is very remarkable that as within that period the general administration of Justice throughout the kingdom hath sunk into the hands of a lower class of people so within that time also the power of a Justice hath rose and been pro∣portionably increased  Great power being on such principles and for such pur∣poses thus lodged in little minds is it to be wondered at if many of them should turn Justice into a trade or if some of them should be so illiterate as not to be able to read What a droll scene it must be and what a fund of mirth it must afford to see his worship Augustus Peas sitting in the chair of ma∣gistracy and hear him learnedly discussing the laws and de∣ciding Justice While I was considering what a comical farce it would make and was musing on the drollery of the scene I insensibly fell asleep when mimick Fancy ever busy pursued the subject and presented to me the following sarce  Methought I saw his worship Augustus Peas sitting in an elbowchair at the head of a long table with a book pen ink and paper thereon and a group of people men and women attending at the lower end thereof when his worship bade a boy step to the stable and tell John Scrub to come im∣mediately John with his short cropt hair and dirty frock presently came in took his seat by his worship and laid hold of the pen and ink Then Mr Augustus with great solem∣nity said"Master Constable what defence hath been com∣mitted What crime hath been disturbed And how hath his Majesty's peas been broke and vindicated"  Constable  An please your honour's worship here is one Mary Blabtruth hath lost a smock and says that Dorothy Lightfinger hath stolen it an so an please you I have brought them both before your worship  Mr Augustus  A smock stolen Why that's down∣right forjury by law Bring the complainant Dorothy Light∣finger before me  Constable  This is the woman an please your worship  Mr Augustus  Hussy how came you to have the sire of God before your eyes and steal the woman's smock You are an equitous baggage and will be hanged"  Dorothy Lightfinger  An please your worship I did not steal her smock  Mr Augustus  Why how now here's the woman con∣fesses she did not steal the smock Where's the defendant Mary Blabtruth  Constable  Here she is an please your worship  Mr Augustus  How came you to discharge Dorothy Lightfinger with stealing your smock for she denies her in∣nocence of it  Mary Blabtruth  An please your worship my smock was hanging on a gooseberrybush in the garden and I saw Do∣rothy Lightfinger take it off with my own eyes"  Dorothy Lightfinger  An please your worship there's no belief in what she says for  Mr Augustus  Peas woman peas I forbid you to hold your tongue  Mary Blabtruth  Indeed an please your worship what I say is true I looked through the kitchenwindow and saw her take it for I was at that very time frying bacon for my husband's dinner  Mr Augustus  Frying bacon woman Was you frying bacon  Mary Blabtruth  Yes an please your worship and some cabbage for my husband's dinner he desired me  Mr Augustus  Where is this woman's husband  Thomas Blabtruth  Here an please your worship  Mr Augustus  Did you desire your wife to fry bacon for your dinner  Thomas Blabtruth  Yes an please your worship with some cabbage  Mr Augustus  Here's a plot found out Here's a mis∣covery Why frying bacon is a high misdammer by law and you shall both go to the girlhouse and be hangedMaster Constable take them into cursetodayAnd do you John Scrub make out their mittamouse for they shall go to goal this instance  Constable  What would your worship please to have done with Dorothy Lightfinger  Mr Augustus  O charge her and let her go about her baseness  Methought John made out the mittimus and the constable carried off the baconfriers and the rest of the company were sent away and while I was wondering what his worship could mean by committing the man and his wife for frying bacon the scene changed and a court of judicature with all it's for∣malities presented itself the judge was sitting on the bench  and a numerous body of black gowns and others attending and Mr Augustus Peas came into court and seated himself not far from his Lordship when the trial of Thomas and Mary Blabtruth for frying bacon was called "For frying bacon" quoth the judge "What is the meaning of this I never heard that frying bacon was a crime or against law before Who committed these persons"  Mr Augustus  I committed them my lord it is against law and a high misdammer  Judge  Pray Mr Justice shew me that law for I never heard of such a one in all my life  Mr Augustus  Here is the book my lord and here is the place Giving the book to his lordship  The Judge having cast his eye upon the page burst out into a loud laugh and with much ado for laughing acquainted the court that the law which Mr Augustus had taken to be against frying bacon was that against firing a beacon which put the whole court into such a loud "Ha ha" as awaked me  CURIOUS INVESTIGATION OF THE RIGHT TO EAT FOUNDED ON PAINE'S RIGHTS OF MAN  BY SIR BROOKE BOOTHBY BART  WHETHER from timidity or prudence the author of "Rights of Man" has not carried his principles to their fair extent He has left untouched a thousand rights necessa∣rily flowing from the imprescriptible and unalienable equality of man in society The right to  eat  for example is at least as natural and imprescriptible as the right to legislate it is somewhat more necessary and of as ancient and divine origi∣nal and when dressed out in a philosophical uniform makes in my opinion just as good a figure Man is an organized entity whose vitality consists in the action and reaction of solid and fluid parts according to the laws of animal motion which re∣quire to be frequently supplied and renewed by the adscitition of elements taken into the mouth masticated by the teeth in∣gurgitated by the gullet received into the stomach and there by trituration fermentation and the rest of the chemicome∣chanical process of digestion prepared and assimilated for the purpose of continuing animality and without which by the natural and imprescriptible laws of animation life must cease the right therefore to  eat  is "one of those natural rights which appertain to man in right of his existance" "one of those  which he must retain in society because the power to execute it is as perfect in the individual as the right itself It is also as ancient and of as divine original as that greatest of all truths the unity or equality of man" and certainly as "advan∣tageous to cultivate""And God said Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree on the which there is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat"" Here we are got at the origin of man and the origin of his rights how the world has been governed from that day to this is no concern of ours every civil right grows out of a natural right and  can∣not invade  those natural rights in which the power to execute is as perfect as the right itself" Hence it follows that the man who appropriates to himself a greater quantity of the food given by God equally to all than is necessary for his own consump∣tion acts in defiance of the natural imprescriptible equal rights of man and that he who goes into the kitchen or larder of this invader of his natural rights and seizes upon what he wants acts in strict conformity to those rights which  society cannot invade  and as to the laws against theft or burglary they are not only in contradiction with the unalienable equal rights of man but were made by men who having ceased to be have no longer any authority in directing how the government of the world shall be organized or administered It is the liv∣ing and not the dead that are to be accomodated the rights of the living cannot be willed away by the manuscript authority of the dead  THE SAILOR'S RETORT OR EVERY MAN IN HIS ELEMENT  ON a trial at the Admiralty Sessions the counsel for the crown asking one of the witnesses which he was for plain∣tiff or defendant "Plaintiff or defendant" says the sailor scratching his head "why I do'n't know what you mean by plaintiff or defendant I come to speak for that man there" pointing to the prisoner "You are a pretty fellow for a wit∣ness" says the counsel "not to know what plaintiff or defen∣dant means" Some time after being asked by the same coun∣sel what part of the ship he was in"Abaft the binnacle my lord" says the sailor "Abaft the binnacle" replied the barrister "what part of the ship is that""Ha ha ha" chuckled the sailor "a'nt you a pretty fellow for a counsellor" pointing archly at him with his finger "not to know what abaft the binnacle is"  THE DOG A TALE FOR JEALOUS HUSBANDS  BY W WHITEHEAD ESQ POETLAUREAT  A Squire of parts and some conceit  'Though not a glaring firstrate wit  Had lately taken to his arms

we love"  But sun and exercise and air  At length dispel the glooms of care  They vanish like a morning dream  And happiness is now the theme  How bless'd his lot to gain at last  So many vain researches pass'd  A wise so suited to his taste  So fair so gentle and so chaste  A tender partner for his bed  A pillow for his aching head  The bosomgood for which he panted  In short the very thing he wanted  "And then to make my bliss compleat  And lay fresh laurels at my feet  How many matches did she slight  An Irish Lord a city Knight  And Squires by dozens yet agree  To pass her life with humble me  And did not she the other day  When Captain Wilkins pass'd our way  The captain Well she lik'd not him  Though dress'd in all his HydePark trim  She lik'd his swordknot though 'twas yellow  The captain is a sprightly fellow  I should not often chuse to see  Such dang'rous visitors as he  I wonder how he came to call  Or why he pass'd that way at all  His road lay farther to the right  And me he hardly knew by sight  Stay let me thinkI freeze I burn  Where'er he went he must return  And in my absence may again  Make bold to callCome hither Ben  Did you observeI'll lay my life  You didwhen first he met my wife  What speech it was the Captain made"  "What Captain Wilkins Sir""The same  Come you can tell""I can't indeed  For they were kissing when I came"  "Kiss did they kiss""Most surely Sir  A bride and he a batchelor"  Peace rascal 'tis beyond endurance  I wonder at some folks assurance  They think like Ranger in the play  That all they meet is lawful prey  These huffbluff Captains are of late  Grown quite a nuisance to the state  Ben turn your horsenay never stare  And tell my wife I cannot bear  These frequent visitsHence you dunce"  "The Captain Sir was there but once"  "Once is too often Tell her Ben  That if he dares to call again  She should avoid him like a toad  A snake a viperThere's your road  And hark'e tell her under favour  We stretch too far polite behaviour  Tell her I do not understand  This kissing tell her I command"  "Heav'n bless us Sir such whims as these"  "Tell her I beg it on my knees  By all the love she ever shew'd  By all she at the altar vow'd  Howe'er absurd a husband's fears  Howe'er injurious it appears  She would not see him if he comes  Nay if she chance to hear his drums  Bid her start back and skulk for fear  As if the thunder rent her ear"  O wond'rous pow'r of Love and Beauty  Obedience is a servant's duty  And Ben obeys But as he goes  He reasons much on human woes▪  How frail is man how prone to stray  And all the long  et coetera  Of sayings which in former ages  Immortaliz'd the Grecian sages  But now the very vulgar speak  And only criticks quote in Greek  With these like Sancho was he stor'd  And Sancholike drew forth his hoard▪  Proper or not he all applied  And view'd the case on ev'ry side  Till on the whole he thought it best  To turn the matter to a jest  And with a kind of clumsy wit  At last on an expedient hit  Suppose we then the journey o'er  And Madam meets him at the door  "So soon return'd and where's your master  I hope you've met with no disaster  Is my dear well""Extremely so  And only sent me here to know  How fares his softer better part  Ah madam could you see his heart  It was not even in his pow'r  To brook the absence of an hour"  "And was this all was this the whole  He sent you for The kind good soul  Tell him that he's my source of bliss  Tell him my health depends on his  Tell him this breast no joy can find  If cares disturb his dearer mind  This faithful breast if he be well  No pang but that of absence feel"  Ben blush'd and smil'd and scratch'd his head  Then falt'ring in his accents said  "One message more he bade me bear  But that's a secret for your ear  My master begs on no account  Your Ladyship would dare to mount  The Mastiff Dog""What means the lad  Are you or is your master mad  I ride a Dog a pretty story"  Ah dearest Madam do not glory  In your own strength temptation's strong  And frail our nature""Hold your tongue  Your master Sir shall know of this"  "Dear Madam do not take amiss  Your servant's zeal by all you vow'd  By all the love you ever shew'd  By all your hopes of bliss to come  Beware the Mastiff Dog""Be dumb  Insulting wretch" the lady cries  The servant takes his cue and flies  While consternation marks her face  He mounts his steed and quits the place  In vain she calls as swift as wind  He scours the lawn yet cast behind  One parting look which seem'd to say  "Beware the Dog" then rode away  Why should I paint the hurrying scene  Of clashing thoughts which pass'd within  Where doubt on doubt incessant roll'd  Enough for me the secret's told  And Madam in a strange quandary  What's to be doneJohn Betty Harry  Go call him back"" He's out of sight  No speed can overtake his flight"  Patience perforce alone remains  Precarious cure for real pains  "I ride a Dog a strange conceit  And never sure attempted yet  What can it mean Whate'er it was  There is some mystery in the case  And really now I've thought a minute  There may be no great matter in it  Ladies of old to try a change  Have rode on animals as strange  Helen a ram a bull Europa  Nay English widows for a  faux pas  Were doom'd to expiate their shame  As authors say upon a ram  And sha'n't my virtue take a pride in  Outdoing such vile trulls in riding  And sure a ram's a weaker creature  Here Betty reach me the Spectator"  "Lord bless me Ma'am as one may say  Your Ladyship's quite mop'd today  Reading will only I'm afraid  Put more strange megrims in your head  'Twere better sure to take the air  I'll order Ma'am the coach and pair  And then too I may go beside  Or if you rather chuse to ride"  "Ride Betty that's my wish my aim  Pray Betty is our Caesar tame"  "Tame Madam Yes I never heard  You mean the mastiff in the yard  He makes a noise and barks at folks  But surely Ma'am your La'ship jokes"  "Jokes Bett  no By earth and heav'n  This insult shall not be forgiv'n  Whate'er they mean I'll ride the Dog  Go pr'ythee free him from his clog  And bring him hither they shall find  There's courage in a female mind"  So said so done The Dog appears  With Betty chirping on the stairs  The floating sacque is thrown aside  The vestments proper for a ride  Such as we oft in HydePark view  Of fustian white lapell'd with blue  By Betty's care were on the spot  Nor is the feather'd hat forgot  Pleas'd with herself th' accoutred lass  Took half a turn before her glass  And simp'ring said"I swear and vow  I look like Captain Wilkins now  But serious cares our thoughts demand  Poor Caesar stroke him with your hand  How mild he seems and wags his tail  'Tis now the moment to prevail"  She spake and strait with eye sedate  Began th' important work of fate  A cushion on his back she plac'd  And bound with ribbands round his waist  The knot which whilom grac'd her head  And down her winding lappets spread  From all it's soft meanders freed  Became a bridle for her steed  And now she mounts "Dear Dian hear  Bright Goddess of the lunar sphere  Thou that hast oft preserv'd from fate  The nymph who leaps a fivebarr'd gate  O take me Goddess to thy care  O hear  tender Lady's pray'r  Thy vot'ress once as pure a maid  As ever rov'd the Delian shade  Though now by man's seduction won  She wears alas a looser zone"  In vain she pray'd She mounts she falls  And Caesar barks and Betty squalls  The marble hearth receives below  The headlong dame a direful blow  And starting veins with blood disgrace  The softer marble of her face  Here might I sing of fading charms  Reclin'd on Betty's faithful neck  Like Venus in Dione's arms  And much from Homer might I speak  But we refer to Pope's translation  And hasten to our plain narration  While broths and plaisters are prepar'd  And doctors feed and Madam scarr'd  At length returns th' impatient Squire  Eager and panting with desire  But finds his home a desart place  No spouse to welcome his embrace  No tender sharer of his bliss  To chide his absence with a kiss  Sullen in bed the Lady lay  And muffied from the eye of day  Nor deign'd a lookaverse and sad  As Dido in th' Elysian shade  Amaz'd alarm'd the bed he press'd  And clasp'd her struggling to her breast  "My life my soul I cannot brook  This cruel this averted look  And is it thus at last we meet"  Then rais'd her gently from the sheet  "What mean" he cries "these bleeding stains  This muffled head and bursting veins  What sacrilegious hand could dare  To fix it's impious vengeance there"  "The Dog the Dog" was all she said  And sobbing sunk again in bed  "The Dog the Dog" express'd her grief  Like poor Othello's handkerchief  Meanwhile had Ben with prudent care  From Betty learnt the whole affair  And drew th'impatient Squire aside  To own the cheat he could not hide  "See rascal see" enrag'd he cries  What tumours on her forehead rise  How swells with grief that face divine"  "I own it all the fault was mine"  Replies the lad "dear angry lord  But hush come hither not a word  Small are the ills we now endure  Those tumours Sir admit a cure  But had I done as you directed  Whose forehead then had been affected  Had Captain Wilkins been forbidden  Ah master who had then been ridden"  A CURIOUS DIALOGUE BETWEEN A BEAU'S HEAD AND HIS

 NUMBER IX  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE IX THE IDLE 'PRENTICE BETRAYED BY A PROSTITUTE AND TAKEN IN A NIGHTCELLAR WITH HIS ACCOMPLICE  THE scene of the present print is laid in a most infamous nightcellar then well known by the name of  Bloodbowl House  near Hanging Sword Alley Fleet Street  While the idle apprentice and his old oneeyed accomplice are dividing their booty a murdered man is let down through a trap door into a concealed cavity under the floor He may probably be considered as having been killed in the affray which is still continuing in the background and affords a masterly exhibition of vulgar miscreants making a dreadful ap∣peal rather to utensils than to arms the countenance of the noseless woman the careless ease and indifference of the man who is smoaking his pipe by the fireside the fellow who sleeps soundly amidst the storm with the emblematical cord hanging over his head the characteristick attitude of the grenadier in the corner the pistols the cards one of which appears to have been torn by an enraged gamester all assist very forcibly to compleat the groupe which wants little of moral perfection but what Hogarth has given it by intro∣ducing the peaceofficers for the purpose of dragging the cul∣prits before the awful tribunal of Justice The wretched female associate of Tom Idle at the same time is receiving her pecuniary reward for betraying her paramour and his pro∣fligate companion whom she points out with her finger at  the very moment when they are disputing about the division of the plunder The watchmen's lanthorns are

CHARLES THE SECOND AND A SAILOR  IN the reign of Charles II a sailor having received his pay resorted to a house of ill fame in Wapping where he laid all night and had his whole property taken from him In the morning he vowed revenge against the first he should meet with possessed of cash and accordingly overtaking a gentle∣man in Stepney Fields to whom he related his mishap he in∣sisted on having his loss made good The gentleman for some time expostulated with him on the atrocity of such behaviour but to no purpose the tar was resolute and the gentleman dreading worse consequences delivered his purse but soon af∣ter had the sailor taken up examined and committed to New∣gate from whence Jack sent a shipmate with the following strange epistle to the King  "KING CHARLES  ONE of thy subjects the other night robbed me of forty pounds for which I robbed another of the same sum who has inhumanly sent me to Newgate and swears I shall be hanged therefore for thy own sake save my life or by Gd thou wilt lose one of the best seamen in thy navy Thine  "JACK SKIFFTON"  His majesty on the receipt of the letter immediately wrote as follows  "JACK SKIFFTON  FOR this time I'll save thee from the gallows but if here∣after thou art guilty of the like by Gd Ill have thee hang∣ed though the best seaman in my navy Thine  "CHARLES REX"  EPISTLE FROM COMMON HONESTY TO COMMON SENSE  LOVING KINSMAN  THE severe treatment I have constantly met with and the universal scorn and contempt so manifestly shewn me by all ranks and degrees of men have so sensibly affected my con∣stitution that I once thought of nothing less than making a total exit from this ungrateful world But the kind reception which youwho are well known to be a collateral branch of our familyhave lately met with has somewhat raised my drooping spirits and encouraged me to shew my head once more though I am so worn to a skeleton that the few of my friends and acquaintance who are yet living I believe will hardly know me again  When I speak of my own sufferings you may perhaps be moved with some compassion as you reflect on the difficulties you have met with and the severities you have undergone though no way comparable to what has become almost habi∣tual to me  You have indeed for some years been under a sort of pro∣scription from courts and ministerial employments but at the same time you have enjoyed a comfortable retreat with the few patriots who have renounced all preferments to adhere to you and have not forsaken your cause in the worst of times while I have not been only rendered incapable of publick trust but such has been the malice of my enemies that I am even denied the happiness of private society like a criminal branded with infamy It is become scandalous according to the pre∣sent mode to be seen in my company or to entertain the least correspondence with me though God knows I have always led a blameless inoffensive life and am so universally hated and despised only because I cannot help people to support the reigning luxury and extravagance and grow rich all on a sud∣den without either merit or laudable endeavours  You know the misfortunes which besel our family at a cer∣tain time and the deplorable condition I was left in without any countenance or support at an age when it could hardly be expected I should shift for myself However I thought it ne∣cessary to endeavour getting into some business for my imme∣diate subsistence and applied myself to a very eminent trades∣man in the city requesting to be taken into his service but to my great grief this first attempt proved unsuccessful He told me I could not be of any use to him in the retail way that there was no instance of such a one as myself ever being behind a counter and in short that he would not advise me  to think of being any way concerned in trade for that I should not find any dealer fond of employing me especially as I was a foreigner and not free of the city However in com∣passion to my wants the tradesman had goodnature enough to give me a letter of recommendation to a noted attorney of his acquaintance who as he assured me very much wanted my assistance and must therefore be glad to entertain me on ho∣nourable terms  This seeming friendship gave me some hopes and I imme∣diately went with my credentials as directed being determined to apply myself wholly to that learned profession I was soon introduced but to my inexpressible concern met with a cold reception He sat lolling in a great elbowchair and an∣swered me with a yawning"What is your name Sir" "Common Honesty Sir" I replied "Common Honesty" cries he yawning again "I have read the letter you brought but am sure Common Sense never fent you hither I cannot by any means receive you into my house you can be of no manner of use to me in my branch of busi∣ness all the imaginary services you may do will never bear the expence of your maintenance for I cannot employ you in one cause in twenty if I should I might be in danger of losing many clients who would naturally suspect your betray∣ing their secrets and if they were once to know I have any dealings with you it would blast my character Besides" adds he "young man were I minded to bear with all these inconveniences at the request of my friend who recommended you to me you would never find the practice of the law turn to any account for yourself you are so odious among those of our profession that it is a great question with me whether you would ever be admitted as an attorney but if you should how will you live Who the Devil do you think will employ you Most people will be afraid of trusting their business in your hands Therefore I would advise you to turn your thoughts to some other profession and if you can do nothing better get yourself ordained you surely cannot be obnoxious to the clergy they will at least give you such outward counte∣nance that you will never want a reasonable support and maintenance"  Finding this solid reasoning would bear no contradiction and being thoroughly convinced I had mistaken myself greatly in this second attempt I maturely considered the wholesome advice given me and began to form some method of putting it in execution and in effect soon thought of a person I ima∣gined very proper for my purpose and who should this be but a certain Right Reverend who when young had great  obligations to our family in recommending him to his first preferment in the church the remembrance of which I hoped would establish me in his favour  I attended him one morning early and waited an hour be∣fore I could beadmitted to an audience when my patience being almost worn out on a sudden the word was given for the stranger to come in to my lord I immediately entered and paid my respects to his lordship in a most submissive man∣ner "How do you do young man" says the prelate "I have not seen you a great while I thought you was dend or gone abroad And pray what has brought you hither now" I gave him the best account I could of my past misfortunes and present unhappy case and while I was employing all my rhetorick to move his pity and compassion his lordship was reading which inattention to my request gave me little hopes of success At last he suddenly laid down his book and turned up his head towards the cielingfor I remarked he could not look me in the face and therefore I inferred he was ashamed to see meand then spoke thus" You talk of the obliga∣tions I have had to your family I know of none some little civilities indeed passed between me and them at college when your father officiously thrust himself upon me as a tutor and to direct me in my first setting out in the world but if I had trusted to his judgment understanding or credit I might have remained at college still" And then he declared he knew of no obligations he had to any one belonging to me so that he could not in any sort intermeddle in my affairs which he thought very incompatible with his station and might be a hin∣drance to his farther advancement and wished me to provide for myself in the best manner I could "For" added he "you may rest assured you will have no assistance from me"  From the example of this Right Reverend and the discourse I had with others of what passed at this interview I was per∣fectly satisfied that for the want of interest at court which I knew myself to be wholly unprovided of there were little hopes of preferment in this road even if I should get ordained the utmost to be expected was some poor Welsh living or a starving curacy in town These re  lections and the experi∣ence I had soon weaned me of all thoughts of dedicating my∣self to the service of the church  Having now tried three different methods for my advance∣ment which I found impracticable I knew not well what pro∣ject next to fall on In this state of uncertainty my wants daily increased which brought me almost to despair How∣ever I walked out one morning and by accident met with a recruitingserjeant I bethought myself the army refused no∣thing  and therefore since I could do no better was deter∣mined to list for a soldier I called the serjeant aside and of∣fered myself to his disposal telling him at the same time as is usual in like cases my name and place of birth The ser∣jeant instead of greedily embracing the offer stood some time in suspense scratching his forehead and at last said" I am afraid my lad you will never learn the military dicipline or make any figure in the field and should you list in our regi∣ment you will be very troublesome both on march and in quarters for no comrade will care to mess with you How∣ever as our captain is in great want of men I will venture to introduce you"  We went away directly to the captain's quarters where the serjeant having told our business and I having answered the same questions as before our noble captain shook his head and said I might perhaps be fit for seaservice but that I was not of a proper size for his company and then demanded of the serjeant where he picked me up and how he came ac∣quainted with me The serjeant replied with great truth that he never saw or heard of me before in his life and acci∣dentally met me a little while ago "Send him packing then" cries the captain "this fellow would make a mutiny in the regiment besides I know all his family are disaffected to the present establishment in church and state and therefore I would not take him on any consideration"  My evil genius still pursuing me I had recourse to another expedient I remembered my father in his lifetime had a place in the Treasury which he enjoyed till the death of his patron a great man who presided at that board by which means I had some little insight into the business of that office and therefore I had no more wit than to fancy I might be use∣ful to his successor I made indeed but a plain appearance as to dress however I resolved to equip myself in the best man∣ner I could attend next morning at his levee and try my for∣tune once more  On my arrival at his door whether I was despised for not being a beau or for not coming in a coach or whether I was taken for a Scotch lord just come to town with my own wants and my ancestors merits I cannot say but to my great surprize Abraham Brass the porter told me his master was not at home This I knew to be false and therefore would have gone in notwithstanding but Abraham shut the door in my face  I could not imagine the cause of this treatment being sure the fellow did not know me however having time to recol∣lect myself a little till opportunity offered by opening the door  for somebody's going out I accosted Abraham very courte∣ously "Sir" says I "you have insulted me without any provocation I must desire to be admitted" and told him my name and the business I had with his master who I knew often valued himself on his intimacy with my family But alas I only made bad worse he fell furiously upon me in the most opprobrious language imaginable called me all the ras∣cals and scoundrels he could think on swore I should never enter the doors while he was porter and that I only came there with some wicked design on his person or to rob the house and that if I did not instantly depart and be gone he would charge a constable with me and swear the peace against me  On this outrage I thought it proper to retire some distance from the door where I took the opportunity as several welldressed gentlemen were going in to tell them my case with the abuse I met with from Abraham begging of them to ac∣quaint his honour with the behaviour of his servant But not a single word could I get out of one of them some shook their heads and others started from me as if I had been in∣fected At last a grave elderly gentleman with a bundle of papers in his hands going into the great man's stopped a little to hear my complaints and was so kind as to open his mouth "I have" says he "Sir some small knowledge of your family with whom I was acquainted before I came into a publick employment but what business have you here Complaining of Abraham Brass's behaviour will be to no pur∣pose he knows his master's mind to whom he ought to be civil and whom he may be rude to and depend upon it you are so universally hated by the whole family whose inte∣rest it is that you should never come within these doors that you are not safe in staying longer so near them lest a worse evil befal you nay I do not know if it were suspected I now speak to you in so friendly a manner but it might be as much as my place is worth therefore I advise you to make off as fast as possible"  By this time kinsman you may suppose I was in a very melancholy condition when I happened to meet with a coun∣try gentleman who without any hesitation on the first re∣presentation of my circumstances took me into his service and entertained me at his countryseat with great kindness and humanity He entrusted me with the management of all his affairs and advised with me on the most important transactions of his life In this situation I looked back on the misery of my former condition with joy and satisfaction changed for the present and being arrived at the bounds of my ambition  peace and content despised all worldly greatness with the spirit of a philosopher  But as nothing in this world is permanent the devil put it into my lady's head to live in town and that my master might not oppose her design from the expences attending the re∣moval she persuaded him to offer himself as a candidate for the late election in a neighbouring borough from the success of which she imagined great preferments would be had for the whole family The scheme was resolved on and I was pre∣sently dispatched away to the place of election as one my master consided in to make timely interest he intending to follow me in a few days I set out on this errand with no very good will foreboding my own destruction in the event and when I came to my journey's end I met with as little success The electors one and all took a mortal antipathy to me at first sight and instead of securing their friendship I made every one of them my enemy and on my master's ar∣rival they insisted I should be forthwith discharged or he must not expect one vote there My master's eagerness to succeed in this election tempted him to comply Immediately I was dismissed with a private intimation that though I was useless in an election yet if I went to town and waited with patience I should be taken in again for the management of my master's private affairs I knew no remedy but submission I went off as privately as I could and soon after my master's arrival in town I waited on him in hopes of what I expected being performed But never was a man so changed as my master he told me to my great grief and surprize that he had no farther service for me of any kind being now engaged to take other measures than when he lived retired in the coun∣try that he was firmly resolved never again to be under the restraint of any other servant that his election cost him a deal of money for a double return and all would be lost if he did not play his cards well and being under a solemn en∣gagement never to have any the least correspondence with me he concluded with forbidding me his house  Having thus loving kinsman tried all reasonable methods of getting a livelihood and having at present no means of sub∣sistence my application which is the last I shall make is to you and finding you have set up a new work my humble request is to be taken into your service  There has formerly been a strict union and friendship be∣twixt the two branches of our family Common Sense and Common Honesty though I own yours to be of superior rank and dignity having supplied the world with many kings and queens But though we have not arrived to that honour  you have found us useful in our station and it can be proved by many instances in history that Common Sense never flourished or made any considerable figure without the assist∣ance of Common Honesty  I know the difficulties of my own condition and how hard it is unsupported to make my way through the world but as we have so often contributed to your support and none of your ancestors ever met with any material check or misfortune while our branch of the family was countenanced by them therefore as we fell so I hope we shall rise together  I do not suspect you will ever write for the ministry in which case I know I shall be entirely useless to you the only favour I ask is some employment under you in the mean time which will be gratefully acknowledged by your affectionate kinsman  COMMON HONESTY  THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF MONSIEUR DE JARDIN  THE Count De Montalto sent Monsieur De Jardin one of his gentlemen to Naples with five hundred pistoles to buy horses and being arrived there as he was standing the next evening in the gate of the inn throwing his purse of gold from one hand to the other he was observed by a young courtezan who wanted neither wit nor beauty the next morning she sent one of her spies privately to enquire who the object of her attention was his business and what other cir∣cumstances related to him or could be of advantage to her design Being informed of particulars whereon to found her plot she dispatched one of her emissaries a cunning gipsey to acquaint him that a lady of quality and a relation of his entreated the favour of a visit The crafty decoy hovered at a distance till De Jardin came out who as was his custom standing at the gate alone she with a modesty as counterfeit as her innocence asked if Monsieur De Jardin was within "Yes my sweet girl" says he "I am the person"" Sig∣nior" says she "my lady commands me to let you know she has the honour to be related to you and if it is not too great a condescension she begs you would spare half an hour from your more important affairs and bestow it on her" De Jardin was not much surprized at so obliging an invitation for though he knew of none of his relations who either to bo  e the title of lady or even lived in Naples yet presuming on the comeliness of his person and good mien he imagined it was some lady of quality who was enamoured of him and  with this pretence courted an opportunity to discover her passion "Madam" says he "I could wish myself worthy of so great a blessing as I now receive and since a ready submission to your lady's commands is the best proof I can give of my zeal and affection to her service I will this very minute pay my respects to her" De Jardin without going into his lodging went directly along with his guide who led him through several cross streets and byeways till they came to the house which in the front appeared fair and reputable at the door a person attended who conducted De Jardin into a room richly furnished both for pleasure and taste As soon as the lady was acquainted that Monsieur de Jardin was be∣low she descended with a portly and majestick grace which lest it should strike too great an awe upon her kinsman she sweetened with an affectionate familiarity and respect The wily courtezan spread her net so well that his dull eye could not discover the least deceit she displayed his pedi∣gree with so much artifice that his obscure family was now derived from one of the most noble houses of all Italy of which she had the honour to be no inconsiderable branch all which his pride and folly easily credited Variety of dis∣course with mutual congratulations for so happy an inter∣view had now spent a good part of the evening when the lady was whispered in the ear that supper was ready She ordered it to be brought in and though it was splendid and elegant she courteously pretended to excuse it as not good enough for so worthy a guest Supper being over De Jar∣din recollecting it grew late and that he was a stranger to the streets was ready with a long harangue of thanks to take leave of so honourable a kinswoman A profusion of compli∣ments were mutually exchanged when taking him by the hand "Nay cousin" says she "though I am sensible your reception has not been equal to your merit yet I flatter my∣self that my house can afford you better accommodations than your inn and if you rob me of your company tonight you have not that esteem for me I am so ambitious of" De Jar∣din whose better genius was absent accepted the invitation  It soon grew bedtime and De Jardin was attended to his apartment by the lady and two of her servants who after a solemn "Good night" withdrew As he was stepping into bed the wine he had drank began to rumble in his sto∣mach for it had been physically prepared for that purpose he therefore asked one of the servants for a necessary conve∣nience and was directed into a little room adjoining his bu∣siness required haste Boldly stepping in a board which lay purposely loose gave way and down he fell to the bottom of  the privy As soon as he had recovered himself from the frightfor hurt he received none except from what was transacting abovehe cried out for help but nobody an∣swered though he heard his kinswoman's voice very merry and loud they were too busy in ransacking his pockets where they found the prize they wanted with bulk unbroken In this distress he discovered a wall which communicated with the street this he endeavoured to scale but with repeat∣ed slips mired himself over head and ears At last however he succeeded and found himself in the middle of the street By the light of the moon he guessed at the house and rung so loud a peal at the door that a grim fellow opened a window and asked what drunken knave gave that unmannerly alarm "I am Sir" says he "the lady's cousin""Sirrah" says he "you are an impudent liar I know no such person Be gone in time or you will too late repent this saucy af∣front" The approach of the watch at this instant forced De Jardin to break off the dialogue and secure himself As he was looking for a place of shelter he spied an open bulk where in the daytime a cobler and an herbwoman kept their shop into which he crept as far as he could to conceal himself till the watch was gone by Three fellows who that night designed to rob the tomb of a cardinal who had lately been buried in the great church having hid their tools in this bulk now came for them De Jardin hearing men talk lay close but one of them groping for the implements and often complaining of a horrible smell at last catched De Jardin by the leg The surprize was equal on both sides however the fellow had the courage to pull him out and examine what sort of a creature lay concealed there De Jardin's shirt was so offensive that they forced him to strip for considering he might be of use to them in their present design and had pos∣sibly overheard some of their discourse they compelled him to go along with them Notwithstanding he was now as naked as he was born yet the filth was thick crusted upon his skin and the smell so noisome they could not endure it For this one of them thought of a proper remedy hard by there was a deep well with a long chain and a bucket at the end of it hither they brought De Jardin put him into the bucket let him down into the well and told him that as soon as he had washed himself clean he must shake the chain and they would draw him up While they stayed for De Jardin the watch came it being very hot to refresh themselves with water the only beverage that could be had at that hour His companions were now forced to run and hide and the watch laid down their cloaks and halberts and drew up the bucket De Jar∣din  with a sudden spring leaped ashore which struck such a panick upon them that they fled leaving the pillage of the field their cloaks and halberts to De Jardin and his com∣rades Having now joined company again they went di∣rectly to the cardinal's tomb and raised up the heavy marble but a dispute arose who should go in De Jardin would not "No" says one of them "wont you but you shall what did we bring you here for else" They soon forced De Jardin to descend and he reached them out the mitre and crosier and pulled off the cardinal's gold fringe gloves which were richly embroidered He had heard them men∣tion a diamondring of great value and this he slipt off and put upon his own finger to secure something in case of the worst They still bade him look for the ring he told them he could find none and they must come in if they either suspected his honour or honesty and look for it themselves "I am sure" said one "it was said he had a very rich ring feel upon the other hand" As they were thus argu∣ing the case they heard a sudden noise in the church which they suspected might be some of the officers this frightened them so that away they ran and let the stone fall down leav∣ing poor De Jardin entombed with the dead cardinal This was a misfortune a thousand times worse than any that had yet befallen him it was impossible for him to raise up the stone and if he made a noise to discover himself he would certainly be executed for sacrilege and robbing the dead and to lie there and starve or be poisoned with the stench of the corrupt∣ing body was still more dreadful It happened that the noise which frightened his companions proceeded from some per∣sons then breaking into the church upon the same design when they came to the tomb they raised up the marble strongly underpropped it and began like the others to dispute who should descend "What" says one of them a bold fellow "are you afraid the dead cardinal should bite you Let me come"  As he was letting himself down De Jardin catched fast hold of his legs the fellow frightened out of his wits cried out "Help help the cardinal has catched me by the legs" and struggling got out and followed his compa∣nions who every step they made expected the cardinal would seize them This gave De Jardin an opportunity of escaping He immediately quitted the church by the s  me way he had entered it and cloathed with one of the watch∣men's cloaks walked about till morning When it was light he enquired out his inn where he borrowed some cloaths and gave a terrible detail of his misfortunesbut not  a word of the ring That evening he left Naples and set forward for France without purchasing a single horse and though he had lost his money and cloaths he was in pos∣session of a ring the value of which at least balanced the account  THE ARCHBISHOP'S LUCK AN ODD ADVENTURE  AN archbishop of Canterbury making a tour into the country stopped at an inn for refreshment Being at the window he observed at a distance in a solitary wood a welldressed man alone talking and acting a kind of part The prelate's curiosity was excited to know what the stranger was about and accordingly he sent some of his servants to observe him and hear what he was rehearsing but they bringing him back an answer no way satisfactory his Grace resolved to go himself He accordingly repaired to the wood ordering his attendants to remain at a distance He addressed the stranger very politely and was answered with the same civility A conversation having been once entered into though not with∣out interruptions by an occasional soliloquy his Grace asked what he was about "I am at play" he replied "At play" said the prelate "and with whom You are all alone""I own" said he "Sir you do not perceive my an∣tagonist but I am playing with God"His lordship thinking the man out of his mind replied"This is a very extraordinary party and pray at what game Sir are you playing""At chess Sir" The archbishop smiled but the man seeming peaceable he was willing to amuse himself with a few more questions "And do you play for any thing Sir""Cer∣tainly" "You cannot have any great chance as your ad∣versary must be so superior to you""He does not take any advantage but plays merely like a man""Pray Sir when you win or lose how do you settle your accounts""Very exactly and punctually I promise you""Indeed Pray how stands your game" The stranger after muttering something to himself said"I have just lost it""And how much have you lost""Fifty guineas""That is a great sum how do you intend paying it Does God take your money" "No the poor are his treasurers he always sends some worthy person to receive the debt and you are at present the pursebearer" Saying this he pulled out his purse and reckoning fifty guineas put them into his Grace's hand and re∣tired saying he should play no more that day  The prelate was quite fascinated he did not know what to make of this extraordinary adventure he viewed the money found all the guineas good recalled what had passed and be∣gan to think there must be something more in this man than he had discovered However he continued his j  urney and applied the money to the use of the poor as had been di∣rected  On his return he stopped at the s  me inn and perceiving the same person again in the wood in his former situation he resolved to have a little farther conversation with him and went alone to the spot where he was The stranger was a comely man and the prelate could not help viewing him with a kind of religious veneration thinking by this time that he was inspired to do good in this uncommon manner The prelate accosted him as an old acquaintance and familiarly asked him how the chance had stood since they had first met "Sometimes for me and sometimes against me I have both lost and won""And are you at play now""Yes Sir we have played several games today""And who wins" "Why Sir at present the advantage is on my side the game is just over I have a sine stroke check mate there it is""And pray Sir how much have you won""Five hundred guineas""That is a handsome sum but how are you to be paid""I pay and receive in the like manner he always sends me some good rich man when I win and you my Lord are the person God is remarkably punctual on these occasions"  The archbishop had received a considerable sum that very day the stranger knew it and producing a pistol by way of receipt the prelate found himself under the necessity of giving up his cash and by this time discovered the divine inspired gamester to be nothing more or less than a thief His lord∣ship had in the course of his journey related the first part of this adventure but the latter part he very prudently took great pains to conceal  A JACKBOOT OR MODERN ESSAY ON TIMES PERSONS AND THINGS  A JackBoot is a discourse which will suit any subject whatsoever as it's namesake will sit any leg It re∣quires no title yet is capable of all You may preach it as a sermon declame it as an oration say it as a prayer or sing it as a song It will finally answer all intents and purposes though in itself it is to no intent or purpose such is the whimsical enigmatical nature of the JackBoot  For these twenty years last past we have had little else pub∣lished but JackBoots One man prints a sermon which may as well be called a satire another comes out with a monody with three or four inter locutors in it Our poetry is as prose and our prose is false English and shall not I club my JackBoot among the rest Yea verily I will  Here therefore begins a Jack Boot upon Times Persons and Things And first for the Times I think we are all pretty unanimous with respect to the Times that is there is an almost universal consent to tail at them There has been a perpetual prejudice in behalf of the times past though God knows we have but little o do with them and we are daily grumbling and abusing the time present when we ought to make use of it and be  hankful  "O tem  ora O m  res"  is an exclamation that has been made use of long bef  re the Roman orator Neverth  less one of the wisest tells us that the former times were not better than these  And now I will quote you a bit of Greck  "Oie men phyllon genee toinde kai andron"  HOM  "The generation of man is even as the generation of leaves" One winter demolishes a whole tribe and in the spring you have a succession of the same wavering weak inconstant trifles  And now I will quote you  piece of Latin  "Elapsum semel  "Non ipse  Jupiter reprehendere"  PHOFD  That is when old Time has once turned tail upon you the devil himself can't get hold of his forelock Which brings me where I was beforehand determined to go to my second and third particulars viz Persons and things Now as every person is a thing though every thing is not a person I shall jumble these two articles together in the true Jackboot taste Now it would require the united wit of Fielding Lucian Swift Butler and Erasmus to treat of this head with any to∣lerable adroitness so as Mr Bayes says in sine I'll say no more about it and if any body asks me Where lies the jest of all this I answer with Mr Johnson "Why in the Boot where should the jest lie"  THE WELCH PARSON'S SHORT SERMON OR MULTUM IN PARVO  IN a certain principality where the lab  urers in the spiritual vineyard are often obliged to siddle as well as to pray for the necessary support of themselves and families about half a  century ago lived an honest and ingenious man of the sacred profession who having a great deal of duty to perform for which however he received a very inadequate recompence was often necessitated to cut as short as possible leaving his hearers to meditate on what he meant to advance in confirma∣tion of his position One Sunday in particular being engaged in the afternoon to play several airs on the Welch harp on which instrument as well as the violin he was an excellent performer he delivered the following incomparable sermon to his different parishioners which for brevity method point and moral we recommend to the attentive perusal of every sin∣cere christian throughout his Majesty's dominions  JOB chap i ver  Naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither  In discoursing from these words I shall observe the three following things  First Man's ingress into the world  Secondly His progress through the world  And thirdly His egress out of the world To return  First Man's ingress into the world is naked and bare  Secondly His progress through the world is trouble and care  And thirdly His egress out of the world is nobody knows where  To conclude  If we do well here we shall be well there  And I could tell you no more were I to preach a whole year  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN OFFICER AND A SOLDIER  A Late celebrated Irish counsellor as remarkable for his brogue as for his bonmots being retained against a young officer who was indicted for a very gross assault opened the cause in the following manner  "My Lord I am counsel for the crown and I am first to acquaint your Lordship that this soldier"  "Stop Sir" says the military hero "I would have you know Sir I am an officer"  "O Sir I beg your pardon" says the counsellor very dryly "why then my Lord to speak more correctly this officer who is no soldier"  MONSIEUR TONSON A COMICK TALE  WRITTEN BY MR TAYLOR  THERE liv'd as Fame reports in days of yore  At least some fifty years ago or more  A pleasant wight on town yclep'd Tom King  A fellow that was clever at a joke  Expert in all the arts to teaze and  smoke  In short for strokes of humour quite  the thing  To many a jovial club this King was known  With whom his active wit unrivall'd shone  Choice Spirit grave Free Mason Buck and Blood  Would croud his stories and  Bon Mots  to hear  And none a disappointment e'er could fear  His humour flow'd in such a copious flood  To him a frolick was a high delight  A frolick he would hunt for day and night  Careless how Prudence on the sport might frown  If e'er a pleasant mischief sprang to view  At once o'er hedge and ditch away he flew  Nor left the game till he had run it down  One night our hero rambling with a friend  Near fam'd St Giles's chanc'd his course to bend  Just by that spot the Seven Dials hight  'Twas silence all around and clear the coast  The watch as usual dozing on his post  And scarce a lamp display'd a twinkling light  Around this place there liv'd the num'rous clans  Of honest plodding foreign Artizans  Known at that time by name of Refugees  The rod of Persecution from their home  Compell'd the inoffensive race to roam  And here they lighted like a swarm of bees  Well our two friends were saunt'ing through the street  In hopes some food for humour soon to meet  When in a window near a light they view  And though a dim and melancholy ray  It seem'd the prologue to some merry play  So tow'rds the gloomy dome our herodrew  Straight at the door he gave a thund'ring knock  The time we may suppose near two o'clock  "I'll ask" says King "if Thomson lodges here"  "Thomson" cries t'other "who the devil's ne"  "I know not" King replies "but want to see  What kind of animal will now appear"  After some time a little Frenchman came  One hand display'd a rushlight's trembling flame  The other held the thing they call  culotte  An old strip'd woollen nightcap grac'd his head  A tatter'd waistcoat o'er one shoulder spread  Scarce half awake he heav'd a yawning note  Though thus untimely rouz'd he courteous smil'd  And soon address'd our wag in accents mild  Bending his head politely to his knee  "Pray Sare vat vant you dat you come so late  I beg your pardon Sare to make you vait  Pray tell me Sare vat your commands vid me"  "Sir" replied King "I merely thought to know  As by your house I chanc'd tonight to go  But really I disturb'd your sleep I fear  I say I thought that you perhaps could tell  Among the folks who in this street may dwell  If there's a Mr Thompson lodges here"  The shiv'ring Frenchman though not pleas'd to find  The business of this unimportant kind  Too simple to suspect 'twas meant in jeer  Sh  ugg'd out a sigh that thus his rest should break  Then with unalter'd courtesy he spake  "No Sare no Monsieur Tonson loges here"  Our wag begg'd pardon and tow'rds home he sped  While the poor Frenchman crawl'd again to bed  But King resolv'd not thus to drop the jest  So the next night with more of whim than grace  Again he made a visit to the place  To break once more the poor old Frenchman's rest  He knock'dbut waited longer than before  No footstep seem'd approaching to the door  Our Frenchman lay in such a sleep profound  King with the knocker thunder'd then again  Firm on his post determin'd to remain  And oft indeed he made the door resound  At last King hears him o'er the passage creep  Wond'ring what fiend again disturb'd his sleep  The wag salutes him with a civil leer  Thus drawling out to heighten the surprize  While the poor Frenchman rubb'd his heavy eyes  "Is therea Mr Thompson lodges here"  The Frenchman faulter'd with a kind of fright  "Vy Sare I'm sure I tell you Sare last night"  And here he labour'd with a sigh sincere  "No Monsieur Tonson in the varld I know  No Monsieur Tonson hereI told you so  Indeed Sare dere no Monsieur Tonson here"  Some more excuses tender'd off King goes  And the old Frenchman sought once more repose  The rogue next night pursued his old career  'Twas long indeed before the man came nigh  And then he utter'd in a piteous cry  "Sare 'pon my foul no Monsieur Tonson here"  Our sportive wight his usual visit paid  And the next night came forth a prattling maid  Whose tongue indeed than any jack went faster  Anxious she strove his errand to enquire  He said 'twas vain her pretty tongue to tire  He should not stir till he had seen her master  The damsel then began in doleful state  The Frenchman's broken slumbers to relate  And begg'd he'd call at proper time of day  King told her she must fetch her master down  A chaise was readyhe was leaving town  But first had much of deep concern to say  Thus urg'd she went the snoring man to call  And long indeed was she obliged to bawl  Ere she could rouze the torpid lump of clay  At last he wakeshe risesand he swears  But scarcely had he totter'd down the stairs  When King attacks him in the usual way  The Frenchman now perceiv'd 'twas all in vain  To this tormentor mildly to complain  And straight in rage began his crest to rear  "Sare vat de devil make you treat me so  Sare I inform you Sare tree nights ago  Got tam I swear no Monsieur Tonson here"  True as the night King went and heard a strife  Between the harrass'd Frenchman and his wife  Which should descend to chase the fiend away  At length to join their forces they agree  And straight impetuously they turn the key  Prepar'd with mutual fury for the fray  Our hero with the firmness of a rock  Collected to receive the mighty shock  Utt'ring the old enquiry calmly stood  The  name  of Thompson rais'd the storm so high  He deem'd it then the safest plan to fly  With"Well I'll call when you're in gentler mood"  In short our hero with the same intent  Full many a night to plague the Frenchman went  So fond of mischief was the wicked wit  They throw out water for the watch they call  But King expecting still escapes from all  Monsieur at last was forc'd his house to quit  It happen'd that our wag about this time  On some fair prospect sought the eastern clime  Six ling'ring years were there his tedious lot  At length content amid his ripening store  He treads again on Britain's happy shore  And his long absence is at once forgot  To London with impatient hope he flies  And the same night as former freaks arise  He fain must stroll the wellknown haunt to trace  "Ah here's the scene of frequent mirth" he said  "My poor old Frenchman I suppose is dead  Egad I'll knock and see who holds his place"  With rapid strokes he makes the mansion roar  And while he eager eyes the op'ning door  Lo who obeys the knocker's ratt'ling peal  Why e'en our Frenchman strange to say  He took his old abode that very day  Capricious turn of sportive Fortune's wheel  Without one thought of the relentless foe  Who fiendlike haunted him so long ago  Just in his former trim he now appears  The waistcoat and the nightcap seem'd the same  With rushlight as before he creeping came  And King's detested voice astonish'd hears  As if some hideous spectre struck his sight  His senses seem'd bewilder'd with affright  His face indeed bespoke a heart full sore  Then starting he exclaim'd in rueful strain  "Begar here's Monsieur Tonson come again"  Away he ran and ne'er was head of more  THE MERRY WORLD  EXAMINE Nature's work around  The whole machine is dance and sound  The Spheres above move round and sing  The Planets run a constant ring  The

will not work and Nell puts on her pinners  The ancient saints make many modern sinners  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS PLATE X  The Industrious 'Prentice Alderman of London the Idle one brought before him and Impeached by his Accomplice  THE COMICK MAGAZINE  NUMBER X  INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS  PLATE X THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE ALDERMAN OF LONDON THE IDLE ONE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND IMPEACHED BY HIS ACCOMPLICE  HITHERTO since the first Print we have not seen the two Apprentices together Their pursuits widely varied and they have been alternately presented with a most forcible contrast to each other The interest is wonderfully heightened on this melancholy interview The victim of Vice originating in idleness a trembling culprit at the bar of Justice while his fellowapprentice as the reward of industry and virtue having attained to the dignity of Alderman of London is consequently a Magistrate and has the severe but necessary duty to perform of committing for trial the companion of his early days who is impeached of robbery and murder by the profligate oneeyed associate with whom he commenced acquaintance by gambling on a tombstone during divine service This wretch who has turned evidence is swearing with the utmost audacity and un∣concern to criminate his accomplice yet contrives at the same time to do what the vulgar denominate  "cheating the devil"  by taking the book with his lefthand This imposition the priggish administerer of the oath with a pen stuck behind his ear is prevented from regarding by the application of a piece of money placed in the dexter palm which he holds slily behind for that purpose The jade who performs this piece  of bribery has a good face and figure though she is supposed to cohabit with that horrid lump of vice and deformity to such shocking degradation is superior beauty generally reduced after the loss of innocence  The attitude of the worthy Alderman while the Mittimus is making out by his Clerk which is to place his late fellowapprentice under the care of the Keeper of Newgate is a noble display of dignified suffering The concern too in the coun∣tenance of the afflicted mother who vainly seeks to soften the selfimportant constable is finely pourtrayed  On the whole this print is most exquisitely impressive and exhibits an interesting picture of human nature in which we behold Guilt detected under all the agonizing horrors of re∣morse and Virtue with a clear conscience feeling anguish but little inferior from the reflection of the ignominy which awaits the companion of his childhood  There are two excellent Mottos for this print  "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment"  LEVITI∣CUS xix  "The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands"  PSALM ix  THE ART OF KICKING  WHEN I took on me the province of a publick writer I was resolved to the best of my poor capacity to make my works entertaining as well as instructive to my readers in order to which I judged it would be absolutely necessary not to dwell too long on the subject Man as well as woman delights in variety and the mind as well as the palate must have change of diet The  "quicquid agunt homines"  is in∣deed a large field for wit and satire to exercise themselves on but often of late when I had chosen my subject and sat down with a design of communicating my thoughts on it I found on recollection that I had been anticipated by some other au∣thors who had lived before me  The Spectator of moral and facetious memory reformed the periwigs the canes and the swordknots of the fops no  he tripped up their red heels if I may be allowed that expres∣sion As to the fairsex he handled them from head to foot not a part about a fine lady was left untouched In a word whenever I take up the Spectator I am ready every minute to break out into the same exclamation that a poet of Gas  oigny uttered on reading over a beautiful ode of Horace "  D  n  these ancients" says he "they have stolen all my fine thoughts"  Writers of such universal talents may draw something that is useful and entertaining from the most barren subject in na∣ture The Spectator beforementioned has been very learned on dancing We have had writers of but a second or third class in fame who have had their excellence a Baronet of North Britain has published a large quarto on the Art of Fencing and a Baronet of Worcestershire has obliged the world with a treatise of immense erudition on the Gymnastick Science or the Art of Wrestling  But no people come up to the Germans in their indefatigable industry for searching antiquity What immense volumes of ancient learning have they rescued from the cobwebs and ob∣livion How have they worked through the rust of time to make discoveries for the improvement of mankind And with what infinite labour have they collected the valuable fragments scattered in different authors on subjects of high importance to the learned world  I have myself seen a history written by one of the German literati entitled"De Veterum Lucernis et CandelabrisOf the Lamps and Candlesticks of the Ancients" It is certain we should be groping in the dark in search of many things be∣longing to antiquity had they not held lights to us Another who was as bright a genius as the former was twenty years in compiling a treatise"De Chirothecis et OcreisOn Gloves and Boots"  I have been credibly informed by travellers that there is a large folio manuscript in the Elector Palatine's library"De Miseriis AmbulantiumOn the Misery of Walking on Foot" in which there is a physical dissertation on Corns There are several volumes"De Veterum Cultellis et FurcisOf the Knives and Forks of the Ancients" written by one Vander∣hackle enriched with cuts an art that has contributed very much to illustrate German wit What need I mention the great Bamboozlebergius who has made a collection"De Mendaciis AntiquorumOf the Lies of the Ancients" which work we hear is shortly to be printed in English for the im∣provement and edification of the youth of this kingdom a cer∣tain great man having taken upon him to patronize it so that I hope every person in employment will be obliged to subscribe under pain of being cashiered  I have likewise been informed that there has been for several years in the publick library at Ratisbon a most curious ma∣nuscript"De Colophis et Caleationibus VeterumOf the Kicks and Cuffs of the Ancients" written by the learned  Vanhoofius and that a copy of this work was some years ago transmitted into England to be laid up in the Royal Library of St James's that it was carefully revised and collated by the late learned Doctor Bentley who has amended an error in the title for he has proved that the substantive Colophis must have been an interpolation of the transcriber and of conse∣quence the true reading is"De Calcationibus Veterum" which he translates thus"Of the Kicks on the Arse of the Ancients" This shews how learning must have suffered through the ignorance of transcribers were it not for the ac∣curacy of such judicious criticks  To confess the plain truth I had a design of writing some∣thing on this subject myself and have already been at no small pains in looking over the Cotton and Bodleian libraries I do not know but it will be very well worth while to take a jour∣ney to Rome on purpose to consult that of the Vatican but I am a little too much confined at present I therefore beg the assistance of the learned of both our universities and I hope they will be so good as to communicate whatever discoveries they may have made on this subject in the course of their read∣ing and as I should be glad to enrich this work with the choicest flowers of antiquity I intend to publish them here It is a subject if well handled that must give great satisfaction to the curious nay I could wish the world was but well in∣formed of some late truths concerning Kicking I fancy it would contribute towards curing the spleen of the whole na∣tion  The stage is the representation of the world and certainly a man may know the humours and inclinations of the people by what is liked or disliked on the stage and I have often ob∣served a Kicking to be the most diverting scene in a modern comedy We have had several poets of our own nation who have succeeded very well this way There is a Kicking be∣twixt Sir Harry Wildair and Alderman Smuggler in the comedy called the Trip to the Jubilee which is allowed by the ablest criticks to be a masterpiece of good writing there is also a Kicking in the old Old Batchelor and another in the Squire of Alsatia which are excellently well penned  Hitherto indeed these Kickings have been only the support and ornament of the comick scene I wish with all my heart some poet of a sublime genius would venture to write a Kick∣ing in a tragedy I am well persuaded if an author were to introduce a king Kicking the firstminister it would have a very good effect such an incident must certainly give great pleasure to the audience and contribute very much to the suc∣cess of the play  But to come nearer to my present purpose I have taken no small pains in examining authors to find out when this custom of Kicking first began in the world I am sorry that the writers of history have not been a little more particular in a matter of so great importance to mankind  Some of the Roman Emperorssuch as Nero Domitian and Caligulawere given to Kicking so indeed was our Harry the Eighth he made nothing of Kicking the House of Commons There is a box on the ear recorded of Queen Elizabeth it was a sudden sally of jealous love it was but a kind of  aigre douceur  and it does not appear that it was the fashion of her court The action of Kicking might be thought a little too robust for the delicacy of her sex it might have ex∣posed the royal legs  et coetera  to the sneers of the young fel∣lows of the court therefore she modestly turned it into a box on the ear  As no man can account how fashions rise and fall who knows but the practice of Kicking on every trifling occasion may be∣come a fashion in this kingdom One of the greatest wits of our nation has placed the seat of honour in a certain part of the body that I do not well know how to describe It is the part which we must not name in wellbred company yet happy is the fair maid who shall rise with that part uppermost in a morn∣ing good luck shall attend her her lover shall be kind and all the wishes of that day shall be crowned with success but if I must describe it still plainer it is the part where school∣boys are punished for false concords and for playing truant If it should I say become a fashion you would see a fellow at court who had just received a most gracious Kick on that part return as proud as a citizen from being knighted and why may not the honour of knighthood be conferred this way as well as by the sword And indeed why might not all titles be conferred this way  Again if you should happen to see a crowd of slaves runn∣ing to the levee of some court favourite in a morning and any body should ask how comes this man to be so courted or so followed the natural answer in this case would be"He has been lately Kicked into preferment"  It might be turned to excellent use towards carrying on the designs of ministers of state in case they should happen to be pursuing measures apparently destructive to the liberties of their country for in this case they must for their own safety be obliged to bribe the representatives of the people and as they would certainly bribe with the people's money not with their own and as I should think it a very right thing to save the publick money I should for that reason humbly propose that  Kicking might be introduced into publick business instead of bribing I do not doubt that it might answer the same pur∣poses for I am firmly of opinion that whoever will take a bribe will take a Kicking  I believe some examples may be brought where it has been made use of with success men I say have been Kicked as well as bribed into measures against their country and there∣fore it is not at all improbable but it may some time or other become a method of carrying on stateaffairs If we should live to see that day young princes instead of riding fencing and dancing would have proper masters provided to instruct them in Kicking and as he that undertook to eat a sword began by eating a dagger so a young adept should begin by Kicking his hat before he was put to Kick a man  As to the young nobility and gentry instead of wasting their youth in studying to understand Horace and Virgil they might be instructed to take a Kicking with a good grace by which means you would see a polite nobility a valiant gentry a most pious dignified clergy and a court that would be a constellation of the most illustrious personages of the kingdom  There is a court of honour in all the countries of Europe In France the mareschals or generals preside in it In Eng∣land the judge of the court of honour is hereditary in the fa∣mily of the first duke of the kingdom I should think that the ceremonial of Kicking a man into a title or a great employ∣ment might be settled by the judges of these courts of honour If I might be worthy of advising in matters of so high a nature I should think it would be too great a fatigue for the prince himself to Kick the whole court especially in countries where the court is numerous I am therefore of opinion that no∣body should have the honour of being Kicked by the sovereign except the first minister the principal secretaries of state the president of his councils and some few others the great officers of the crown but these might Kick those next in employment under them who might Kick the next and so it might gra∣dually descend till there should not be a man in any employ∣ment in the kingdom but what might be Kicked  It is not yet indeed become a custom in any part of Eu∣rope the more is the pity for I think it would be a truly royal exercise for a prince to divert himself with Kicking two or three of his ministers every morning it would contribute to the preservation of his own health as well as to mending the manners of his court and I believe it would have become a fashion some where or other were it not that the young no∣bility of all nations travel to France and are apt to retain im∣pressions of what they see there The barbarity of a French  education will not suffer a gentleman to take a Kick from any person be he ever so great without some terrible conse∣quences but I hope that in this nation we may live to get the better of those prejudices which may have this good con∣sequence it may introduce an elegance and politeness of man∣ners not known in the world except among the ancient Goths and modern Hottentots  I may say without vanity that we are not such barbarians but there may be found among us some great men who can pocket up a Kick or a cuff with as good an air as they could a bribe and as to those splendid agitations of choler which are apt to break out into "Rogue" and "Rascal" I am cre∣dibly informed some very stately persons are so used to them that they receive them with the same countenance as"Sir I kiss your hands" This shews we are well disposed for a re∣formation of manners yet I fear it will not grow into general imitation unless the court should set the example which I am afraid will not happen but if we should live to see that day the placemen must of course all fall into it and I think it would be pleasant enough when a great employment became vacant to see a parcel of impudent fellows in lace and embroi∣dery pressing and elbowing to be Kicked  If the common people who are not fond of new fashions at their first rise should discover any dislike of coming into it why might not a Standing Army be employed to Kick the whole nation  ADVERTISEMENT FROM DOROTHY REDFIST OR QUALIFICATIONS OF A MODERN MAIDSERVANT  SETTING aside all houshold work which I do very well if I please I can tell lyes of my master and mistruss and when I am sent of an arrand let it be for what it will in the grocery way allways go to the chandler'sshop where the good old woman that keeps it commonly keeps a dram of that that's good and is as eager to know the secrets of the family as I am to tell them  Secondly I can take a lump of freshbutterif it is not quite so good for a sarvant's stomach as it should beand flounce it into the greasetubbor the inside sat of a surloin of beefwith as much dexterity as any girl in the kingdom those an I say it where many other sarvants to their shame be it spoken would give it away to a dog or a poor parson which I think is no sign of their savingness because if they rightly consider the revenues of the greasetubb when properly ma∣naged  would bring them three of four good gownds to their backs in a year  Thirdly I am very quick of hearing when nobody calls and if any body does especially my master or mistrus I am so deaf I cannot hear them till they have almost tore their winpipes with calling This is a soverign vartue in a sarvant for when a master or mistrus thinks a sarvant's deaf they are apt to talk about their secrets with less suspicion and sometimes they may call one another Dog and Bitch upon the presumption that the sarvant cannot hear them  Fourthly When there is any reason to imagine my mistrus  going to have a new gownd I can tell her such a story that I a'n't in the least afeard of getting the old one for myself  Fifthly If my master should come home late and in liquor I can help him up to bed and in case my mistrus is out of town supposing he should be incapable of undressing himself I can pull off his cloaths and if required can go to bed to him as well as my mistrus  Sixthly If my mistrus should be a breeding woman and apt to lyeinn during the time I can side with the nurse and make as much waste as herself play up old gooseberry with the pots and saucepans and nock the pewter and brasses about with as much consideration as if they cost nothing at all  Seventhly During her lyinginn I can trump up a story about my master's going to lewd women This you know may have it's effect for if a mistrus takes on in such a situation and frets much about it who knows but she may die and then I stand a chance to marry my master  Eighthly If there is a crust of bread harder than ordinary I always carry it to my master's table for masters and mistrusses may eat it because they know their sarvants won't  Ninthly If there is any kind of greens for dinneras there commonly isI always take care to send the outside leaves to master's table and detach the best part in a cullender over some hot water till they have done for why should not sarvants know what's good as well as their masters and mistrusses  P S These and many other excellent vartues too tedious to mention I porsses and should take it very kind of you Mr Editor if you should hear of any body that wants such a sar∣vant Indeed it is not any place I would go to for good places are very scarce and where there is one master or mistrus that knows the vartues of a true sarvant there are twenty that don't therefore I should be obliged to you if you publish the above catalog in your Maghazeen  CONJUGAL CASE OF A COUNTRY PHYSICIAN OR CAUTIONS TO OLD BATCHELORS  I Am a physician and as my case is very extraordinary I mean to publish it for the benefit of the publick When a man lives as I did unmarried till he is sixtyone he had better never marry at all There are more ways by which a woman may torment her husband besides being jealous of him To give you some idea of my situation take the general outlines of my history The earliest part of my life I spent at college in the study of physick and I don't know why acquired the character of an odd learned fellow When I arrived at the age of forty a vacancy happened in the neighbourhood of my birth and I was invited by my uncle to take upon me the infirmities of all the folks within the circle of twenty miles Before I set out I ordered the collegebarber to make me what the wags called a Lion or a Pomp  y literally nothing more than a good physical wig under the shadow of which by the assist∣ance of a handsome cane properly applied to the immoveable muscles of my face and a few very significant shrugs and solemn nods I soon acquired the reputation of an eminent physician Fees came in apace so that in the course of twenty years I had saved up more money than I really knew what to do with Whether it was my learning my person or my money I can't say but a lady of the neighbourhood took a vast liking to something belonging to me I was not so blind but I saw the conquest for she would often come and spend a week to∣gether with me in short I married herI was past the years of discretion and so I married her O what a condescension A lady of her rank family and fashion in life As for age indeed she was but six years younger than myself and for for∣tune if she ever had any she had spent it and yet I was such a fool as to be convinced she was conferring the greatest obli∣gation in the world upon me  No sooner did  e take upon her the management of my fa∣mily than adieu for  ver to all order peace and comfort She began with discharging poor Jonas because he made so queer a figure in a long qu  and white stockings which she in∣sisted upon his wearing though the poor follow could not but laugh at himself The same day with Jonas my old wig was discarded it must be confessed it rather grew the worse for wear From long acquaintance it had contracted such a con∣nection and familiarity that it no longer kept that re  al distance from each side of my face which had at first so much distinguisned it I had however still contiued it in ser∣vi  e purely from this reflection that the older it grew the loss  occasion it had for combing A new wig has been immedi∣ately put on the shocks with a feathered top and forked tail since the arrival of which I am never suffered to stir out let the occasion be ever so pressing before it is combed and pow∣dered Our prig of a new footman is so long in twisting and turning and tickling it up that a score of patients have ex∣pired and the fees have been lost ere I was able to set out to re∣lieve them  My snuffcoloured suit had been reinstated every other year from a pattern that was left in the hands of an honest taylor on the neighbouring heath He poor fellow was likewise forbid the house because according to my directions he made my cloaths easy A more fashionable operator was charged with preparing a new suit with gold buttonholes he made them to sit so exactly that I dare not bring my hands to meet before me for fear of laying open my spinal bone  My hat is not to be slapped any more even though the sun shine full in my face  I am no longer suffered to wash my face according to custom every morning at the pump in my backyard though nothing was more refreshing nor any thing more handy than the towel which revolved on a roller at the back of the kitchen∣door  On my return home the other day from visiting a patient I found the maid had set my study to rights as she called it but the consusion which the regularity has occasioned is almost in∣conceivable My toepin my shoeinghorn and tobaccostopper are lost for ever my papers are disposed in such or∣der that I know not where to recur to any thing I want  Two pair of old Manchester velvet breeches which I left on the back of a chair have disappeared and instead of the easy slippers which I had made out of an old pair of shoes by cutting the straps off I found a new pair of red leather adorned with white stitches round the edges and made so neat that I can't bear to walk in them  My woollen nightcap is condemned in company with my brown hose to the vile purpose of rubbing the grates and senders and my wife insists that I wear one of linen flounced on all sides adorned with a black ribband which tying toge∣ther the aperture within an inch and a half of the top care∣lessly slows down on the side I took such a violent cold the first night that it brought a defluxion of humours into my right eye which very nearly deprived me of sight  The staircase and floors are all waxed it saves the expence of mops indeed but I have such falls that I have almost dislo∣cated every joint about me  My neck is stretched out in such a manner that I am appre∣hensive of having my throat out with the pasteboard  When I remonstrate on any of those articles she stops my mouth by a kiss and says"My dear angel we must have some little regard to appearances"  She is as I told you but six years younger than myself yet she dresses dances and drives about as if she was but fiveandtwenty  This however and much more I could bear I deserve it I am contented she shall consume sixandthirty yards more than my old maid Hester in the spinning of her gown she may play a shilling a fish at quadrille she may doaye she may do what she pleases let me have but my study to myself let my nightcap and slippers he restored and I will submit to wear the new coat and the wig every Sunday  P S I long to take poor Jonas again he used always to ride before me and drunk or sober he knew the shortest way all over the country What signifies whether one's foot∣man wears a wig or his own hair 'Tis true he never blacked either my boots or his own  ADVICE TO A YOUNG LADY RESPECTING THE O  CONOMY OF HER HOUSE  AS you are now tenant at will in a very handsome HOUSE are capable of furnishing it in the politest manner and of ruling it by the strictest maxims of oeconomy and decorum permit a friend to give a few cursory hints in an affair of so much importance  The Building as you must be convinced is composed of some of the finest materials that were ever beheld and is of course extremely liable to discover every s  and spot that may affect it It is erected of a proper beight of a just  and on a regular plan and finished with the mose  currat  pro∣portions  On the top stands an eminent Turret furnished with a Room of a globular form which I observe has two  ysial Windows in the front These are so constructed and to be ex∣ceedingly useful they command an extensive prospect and if always kept clean and bright will prove a very great  to your House I advise you not to look through  object that passes by to shut them soon  the and to open them as early as possible in the morning On each  of the Turret I observe that there is a small For  com∣pany but take particular care that these wo  e  are guarded  by a proper centinel and by no means suffered to stand open as you will otherwise be perpetually crouded with Visitors and perhaps with many disagreable ones However let these useful Portals never be shut against the advising Friend the instructing Parent or the supplicating Orphan There is a single Gate in the front by which all your company is dis∣missed and this should in general be barred close it is indeed so very publick that you can hardly let out any Visitor pri∣vately and you must be very careful that no suspicious cha∣racter be seen to quit it lest you draw a scandal on your House Whatever Company therefore may have forced their way into the SidePortals it will be necessary to lay the strict∣est injunctions of vigilance on the Two able Porters who stand constantly before the ivory Pallisadoes in a livery of the deepest scarlet I have seen some Ladies paint the Two Pan∣nels just below the Windows of their Houses but I advise you to avoid that custom as the natural colours far exceed every decoration of art  This part of the Edifice is supported by a Pillar of Corinthian Marble the base of which is ornamented with a pair of Ala∣baster SemiGlobes and over these it will be very proper to draw a fine lawn curtain  Beneath these is the Great Hall in which you have a small Closet of exquisite workmanship this I suppose is the place of your secret retirement open to none but yourself and some approved friends I advise you to keep this always clean to furnish it well to make it a little library of the best practical authors and to visit it frequently especially when you return from church or leave a circle of acquaintance whom you have met at the teatable  Let the outside of your Hall not appear like a horse hung round with  seutcheons nor be like a coach of state da  bed over with tinsel and colourings but let it be plain and near to convince the world that it is kept more for use than or∣nament  You are sensible Miss that Time effaces the beauty and demolishes the strength of the noblest structures and there∣fore do not be alarmed on finding yours subject to the like change Doubtless it has often wanted repairs though you have lived in it no longer which is a plain intimation that the House must in a few years fall You may indeed soon be turned out the Landlord may give you warning or he may not and as all this is quite uncertain be perpetually pre∣pared and then you need never be afraid of quitting it  One thing I must not forget to observe when you have once left your House no other human being will ever inhabit  it but it will be waste and in ruins yet the Proprietor has pro∣mised some time or other to rebuild it for your reception in a more durable manner But though it will then be constructed with the same materials they are to be so refined and modified by the Great Architect that the edifice will not be in future liable to any accident or decay and as it is absolutely neces∣sary that your Habitation be reared in some other place I hear∣tily wish it may be situated in a finer country under a milder climate and on a spot not exposed to those pitiless storms which injure and too often destroy the best contrived Build∣ings in this sublunary abodesince you must then take it for a term which will never expire  THE STREET SWEEPERS A MOCK HEROICK POEM  BY W WHITEHEAD ESQ  I Sing of Sweepers frequent in thy streets  AUGUSTA as the flowers which grace the spring  Or branches withering in autumnal shades  To form the brooms they wield Preserv'd by them  From dirt from coachhire and th' oppressive rheums  Which clog the springs of life to them I sing  And ask no inspiration but their smiles  Hail unknown youths and virgins unendow'd  Whether on bulk begot while rattled loud  The passing coaches or th' officious hand  Of sportive linkboy wide around him dash'd  The pitchy flame obstructive of the joy  Or more propitious to the dark retreat  Of roundhouse owe your birth where Nature's reign  Revives and emulous of Spartan fame  The mingling Sexes share promiscuous love  And scarce the pregnant female knows to whom  She owes the precious burden scarce the sire  Can claim confus'd the manyfeatur'd child  Nor blush that hence your origin we trace  'Twas thus immortal heroes sprung of old  Strong from the stolen embrace by such as you  Unhous'd uncloath'd unletter'd and unfed  Were kingdoms modell'd cities taught to rise  Firm laws enacted freedom's rights maintain'd  The gods and patriots of an infant world  Let others meanly chaunt in tuneful song  The blackshoe race whose mercenary tribes  Allur'd by halfpence take their morning stand  Where streets divide and to their prosser'd stools  Solicit wandering feet vain pensioners  And placemen of the crowd Not so you pour  Your blessings on mankind nor traffick vile  Be your employment deem'd ye last remains  Of publick spirit whose laborious hands  Uncertain of reward bid kennels know  Their wonted bounds remove the bord'ring filth  And give th' obstructed ordure where to glide  What though the pitying passenger bestows  His unexpected boon must they refuse  The wellcarn'd bounty from th' obtruded ore  Proud were the thought and vain And shall not we  Repay their kindly labours men like them  With gratitude unsought I too have oft  Seen in our streets the wither'd hands of age  Toil in th' industrious task and can we there  Be thrifty niggards Haply they have known  Far better days and scatter'd liberal round  The scanty pittance we afford them now  Soon from this office grant them their discharge  Ye kind churchwardens take their meagre limbs  Shivering with cold and age and wrap them warm  In those blest mansions Charity has rais'd  But you of younger years while vigour knits  Your labouring sinews urge the generous task  Nor lose in fruitless brawls the precious hours  Assign'd to toil Be your contentions who  First in the dark'ning streets when Autumn sheds  Her earliest showers shall clear th' obstructed pass  Or last shall quit the field when Spring distrills  Her moist'ning dews prolisick there in vain  So may each lusty seavenger ye fair  Fly ardent to your arms and every maid  Ye gentle youths be to your wishes kind  Whether Ostree's fishy sumes allure  As Venus' tresses fragrant or the sweets  More mild and rural from her stall who toils  To feast the sages of the Samian school  Nor ever may your hearts elate with pride  Desert this sphere of love for should ye youths  When blood boils high and some more lucky chance  Has swell'd your stores pursue the tawdry band  That romp from lamp to lampfor health expect  Disease for sleeting pleasure soul remorse  And daily nightly agonizing pains  In vain you call for Aesculapius' aid  From White Cross Alley or the azure posts  Which beam thro' Haydon Yard the god demands  More ample of  'rings and rejects your prayer  And you ye fair O let me warn your breasts  To shun deluding men for some there are  Great lords of counties mighty men of war  And welldress'd courtiers who with leering eye  Can in the face begrim'd with dirt discern  Strange charms and pant for Cynthia in a cloud  But let Lardella's fa  e avert you own  Lardella once was fair the early boast  Of proud St Giles's from it's ample Pound  To where the Column points the sevenfold day  Happy thrice happy had she never known  A street more spacious but ambition led  Her youthful footsteps artless unassur'd  To Whitehall's fatal pavements there she plied  Like you the active broom At sight of her  The coachman dropp'd his lash the porter oft  Forgot his burden and with wild amaze  The tall wellbooted sentry arm'd in vain  Lean'd from his horse to gaze upon her charms  But fate reserv'd her for more dreadful ills  A lord beheld her and with powerful gold  Seduc'd her to his arms What cannot gold  Effect when aided by the matron's tongue  Long tried and practis'd in the trade of vice  Against th' unwary innocent Awhile  Dazzled with splendor giddy with the height  Of unexperienc'd greatness she looks down  With thoughtless pride nor sees the gulph beneath  But soon too soon the highwrought transport sinks  In cold indifference and a newer face  Alarms her restless lover's sickle heart  Distress'd abandon'd whither shall she fly  How urge her former task and brave the winds  And piercing rains with limbs whose daintier sense  Shrinks from the ev'ning breeze Nor has she now  Sweet Innocence thy calmer heartfelt aid  To solace or support the pangs she feels  Why should the weeping Muse pursue her steps  Thro' the dull round of infamy thro' haunts  Of publick lust and every painful stage  Of illfeign'd transport and uneasy joy  Too sure she tried them all till her sunk eye  Lost it's last languish and the bloom of health  Which revell'd once on Beauty's virgin cheek  Was pale disease and meagre penury  Then loath'd deserted to her life's last pang  In bitterness of soul she curs'd in vain  Her proud betrayer curs'd her fatal charms  And perish'd in the streets from whence she sprung  THE MERRY MONARCH OR K  HTHOOD A JEST A TALE  WHEN good King Jemmy wore the British crown  A pleasant jest for highest wit went down  A pun a quibble a conundrum quaint  Oft made a bishop of a man no saint  Smart repartees pass'd all for sterling coin  And wit was then as unrefin'd as wine  The king himself so rest his merry soul  Could crack his jokenor would his mirth controul  But laugh full hearty if the jest were keen  Nor could the care of kingdoms give him spleen  Thus story tellsAs he rode out one day  To chace the stag he lost by chance his way  The courtiers eager scour the spacious field  While duty there did unto pleasure yield  Alone King Jemmy with his usual grace  Kept stepping onward in a common pace  Till near two clowns he came who work'd full hard  Hedging a close behind a farmer's yard  They spied the king and from his aukward mien  Thought he some needy northern laird had been  "Gend men" quoth heand then he made his bow  "Ken ye which way the nobles rode just now  My business leads me unto our King James"  "I know him not in troth" quoth one "it seems  He only minds his countrymen while we  Labour thus hard to furnish out their glee"  "Ride on" quoth t'other "man you'll find him out  Surrounded by a gaudy Scottish rout  Fear not thy fortune Jemmy loves a loon  And thou're some starving knight that wants a boon"  "Weel fare ye" quoth the king "and o' my weard  Goud character ye to your prince affeurd  And Ise wat weel it all gangs to his ear"  "Why then" quoth Dick "for once the truth he'll hear"  So saying to a grove that lay in sight  On rode the king and there thought fit to 'light  Outstretch'd his royal limbs upon the place  And stept full sweetly on the verdant grass  No policies of state disturb'd his mind  But that good prince snor'd loud as any hind  Until the chace was o'er and stag was dead  When duty found a place in courtier's head  Nor had the noble train long sought their lord  Ere fast they found him on the gay greensward  Hasty they then from reeking coursers spring  While with a smile up rose the jocund king  "My lords" quoth he "as you rid yonder by  Did you not hedging twa auld carles spy  In leather doublets clad""My liege we did"  Quoth one "See then" said he "them hither lead"  Straight they obey'd and as they dragg'd each clown  "Ads me" quoth Dick to Ralph "we're both undone  You man we took for some poor begging knight  Is the king's grace""Ods fish" quoth Ralph "you're right  We shall be hang'd What will become of Sue  She'll pine to death" "And so will Margery too'  Them at a distance when the monarch spied  He took the whynyard from his martial side  Behind him on the ground it's point he stay'd  As not much caring to survey the blade  Low on their knees the trembling wretches crawl  And sweat with fear their heads should lower fall  "Your names" quoth Jemmy in an angry tone  "Mine is poor Dick""Mine Ralph a sorry clown"  "Weel" quoth the king and gave their necks a strap  "Sir RalphSir Richardye may both get up  Now knights ye are and o' my soul I ween  Twa peurer knights in Scotland ne'er were seen"  A loud applause the fawning crowd express'd  To see two titles toto make one jest  THE DECISION A TALE FOR WIDOW'S  CLARISSA sprightly once and gay  Now sign'd the tedious hours away  She mourn'd the kindest husband gone  The husband muchbut more the man  Dark weeds conceal'd the fair from view  Yet mightily became her too  She veil'd her pretty blubber'd face  And wept her dearwith such a grace  But lo young Florimond appears  To dry the joyless widow's tears  His suit she heard with warm disdain  Protested all his hopes were vain  Her hands she wrung her robe she rent  And wept and "wonder'd what he meant"  Yet thro' the drop that drown'd her eye  'Tis said there shone a spark of joy  And sage diviners could foretel  That Florimond might yet do well  A scruple now disturb'd her head  "Whether it were a sin to wed"  Queries and doubts her brain possess'd  And busy Conscience broke her rest  So to resolve this knotty case  She seeks the curate of the place  "A Casuist"Deep"Of judgment sound  Yes fam'd for partsthe parish round  Clarissa with the rising sun  Approach'd her friend and thus begun  "Full sixty times hath yonder light  Arose as oft hath sunk in night  Since the lamented hour that gave  My faithful consort to the grave  And sure no second love shall e'er  Efface the image still so dear  Clarissa to his memory just  For ever shall revere his dust  Yet cruel Prudence may require  What else were foreign to Desire  And midst a weight of cares you know  What can a helpless woman do  My heedless servants slight my call  My farmers break my houses fall  And Florimond with winning air  Tells me they want a husband's care  What does my learned Doctor say"  "Why marry surewithout delay"  "But should the lover prove unkind  A tyrant o'er a tender mind  How hard my lot condemn'd to mingle  Tears with my cup""Why then live single"  "But what if an obdurate fair  Should drive a lover to despair  You know the foolish freaks of men  I dread the thought""Nay take him then"  "But should he squander my estate  And pawn my jewels rings and plate  And witless I by folly led  Be turn'd adrift to beg my bread"  The Doctor vers'd in womankind  Perceiv'd the workings of her mind  "Madam" he cries "when truth we seek  All argument is often weak  When reasons weigh on either part  Opinion vainly tries her art  So till descending Truth prevails  She sits suspended o'er the scales  A way more speedy shall be tied  A tongue shall speak that never ly'd  Know Madam then my parishbell  Is famous for advising well  Whate'er the point in question be  It hits the matter to a T  Thus as it dictates by it's tone  You sure must wedor lie alone"  Now tow'rd the church in haste they go  "The widow chearful"But so so  Yet vows whate'er the answer given  She piously will yield to Heaven  The Doctor too exhorts the fair  To listen and decide with care  And now the mystery to unfold  He turn'd the key the bell he toll'd  The widow mus'd and knit her brow  "Well Madam pray what think ye now"  Here first she sobb'd and wip'd her eye  Then labour'd out a doleful sigh  "Think Doctor Why the case is plain  Alas I find resistance vain  Ah Florimond and must I yield  In Heaven 'tis said our doom is seal'd  Yet not by choiceby fate I'm won  The will of Heaven be ever done  The bell ordains thee to my bed  For hark it fairly bids me "wed"  Dear Doctor thenI speak with sorrow  Be sure you be at home tomorrow  Think you the simple tale too long  Then hear the moral of my song  The moral to no sex confin'd  Regards alike all human kind  Sly passion and distemper'd sense  Usurp the form of evidence  And truth and falshood good and ill  Receive their tincture from the will  Man boasts his reason's power in vain  The pageant drags a hidden chain  A varied shape each object wears  Just as he wishes hopes or fears  His deepest thought his vaunted rule  Is Passion's slave or Folly's fool  'Tis hence we blindly can approve  The very faults of those we love  'Tis hence we blindly can debate  The noblest deeds of those we hate  Abroad thus works perverted will  At home our views are darker still  And actions deem'd absurd in thee  Are prudent wise and just in me  Selflove adores her own caprice  Still deifies each darling vice  And by the colour of a name  Removes at once the guilt and shame  The prodigal is generous free  The Miser boasts oeconomy  Gay the Debauch'd the Proud is great  The bold Oppressor hates a Cheat  The fawning Slave obliges all  And mad Revenge is Honour's call  Thus Passion shoots thro' every part  The brain is tainted with the heart  Weak Judgment falls before Temptation  And Reasonis but Inclination  THE COUNTRY JUSTICE A TALE  SIR John a country Magistrate  Of good round belly hobbling gait  Well know at ev'ry merry meeting  Fam'd both for justice and for eating  Was most severe as stories tell us  Aga oft the younger sprightly fellows  When frolicksome for youth are wild  They chanc'd to get the maids with child  Would sternly take the cause in hand  And both the parties reprimand  With utmost rigour would enforce  The rigid laws that came in course  Nor ever in the least excuse  That slight  faux pas  so much in use  And yet by some 'twas shrewdly thought  That he himself was sometimes naught  And those who heard what neighbours said  Had little doubt he kiss'd his maid  But strangely Time brings things about  As murder some odd time will out  And so it chanc'd one luckless night  When love unusual fir'd the knight  His post so boldly he maintain'd  The fatal growing proof remain'd  For scarce six months were gone and past  Ere Betty swell'd about the waist  But warn'd before of this disaster  The fearful wench inform'd her master  Whoas it is the sinner's way  To put far off the evil day  Neglects her till so large it made her  That to the neighbours it betray'd her  Now good Sir John begins to stir  And trembles for his character  Advises Betty full of care  The bastard not on him to swear  And if she'll put disgrace aside  He'll for the child and her provide  Betty whose conscience wond'rous nice is  Is puzzl'd in this doubtful crisis  But truth beyond her virtue prizes  And th' offer secretly despises  Yet as her circumstances lay  Conjectur'd 'twas the wisest way  Resentment and her thoughts to smother  And say she'll lay it to another  The knight thus eas'd commits each whore  And acts with rigour as before  And tho' oft told of Betty's failing  Pretends to disbelieve their railing  Till time run on and Betty grew  So large to each impartial view  That now the danger was the same  Against the cautious knight's good name  When now to keep his fame he thought  And ordered Betty to be brought  The quorum sat the blushing wench  In publick stood before the bench  Sir John who thought himself secure  Began to thunder out his power  Demands aloud who has beguil'd  Th' unhappy maid and got the child  The book's held out she stoops to kiss it  And "If I must disclose who is it"  She cried"that hath my truth beguil'd  Sir John is father to the child"  Now sudden grief surprize and shame  O'er whelm the knight and blast his fame  The tale each stand'rous tongue reveals  And swells the story as it tells  To truth they add a thousand lies  And shame increasing as it flies  Each girl unpunish'd stains her gown  And bastards swarm throughout the town  ODE TO NASTINESS  O Goddess of the dirty hue  With eyes so red with cheeks so blue  With mouth so wide and eke so wet  With lips of snow with teeth of jet  O thou to whom the stars bequeath  A vulture's voice and viper's breath  Kindly accept the verse that's due  To Cindercola none but you  Hail Nastiness I thee adore  Cindercola's favourite care  Mellow'd ye with her you sleep  With her you bask at morning peep  And comfortably funk and soak  Lodg'd in a nasty dirty smock  Or else in filth you loll away  In an undress a summer's day  What tho' the laundress may look grave  They threepence get who threepence save  And to wash oft the coarsest clout  Most certainly will wear it out  Fast every festival you keep  Watch much if ye intend to sleep  And be long dirty if you mean  To enjoy the sweets of being clean  O Nastiness I thee adore  Friend to the miser and the poor  How many craftsmen by thee live  How many poets with thee thrive  And write in rags and stinking room  Works to bless ages yet to come  Which as the earth from chaos sprung  Or cucumbers grow out of dung  Or sugar most resin'd arose  From Indians black filthpressing toes  So from the rubbish of thy brain  Rises a bright poetick strain  Which tho' in dirty garrets bred  Is yet in sine apartments read  Monks merit Heaven in dirty cloisters  And dirty shells preserve clean oysters  Dear Cindercola ever be  From cleanliness so costly free  Dirt to our souls can do no harm  Dirt helps to keep the body warm  Dirt interferes not with our quiet  And hunger's pleas'd with dirty diet  Nay some say both at court and kirk  Folks often go thro' dirty work  From dirt we came to dirt we go  By God all things are dirt below  Be dirty witty then and rake  And shine like Chattsworth in the Peak  Bright be your souls for ever seen  Bright thro' their nasty dirty screen  THE COMBAT OR RED BLACK AND WHITE  A Chimneysweep and Baker went to fight  The Baker beat the Chimneysweeper white  The Chimneysweep tho' laid upon his back  Took wind and quickly beat the Bakerblack  In came a Brickdustman with porter fed  And  at both Chimneysweep and Baker red  Th  red black white in clouds together lay  And none could tell which party had the day  EPITAPH ON ALEXANDER PECK ESQ  BY MR TATTAM  HERE lies a Peck which some men say  Was first of all a Peck of clay  This wrought with skill divine while fresh  Became a curious Peck of flesh  Through various forms it's Maker ran  Then adding breath made Peck a man  Full sixty years Peck felt life's bubbles  Till death reliev'd a Peck of troubles  Thus fell poor Peck as all things must  And here he liesa Peck of dust  A CURIOUS EPITAPH  HERE lies interred  A friend to both sexes  Who from a strict obedience  To the Fundamental Laws of Nature  Dedicated himself entirely  To the use of his superiors  Framed for the good of the publick  He proved  A useful subject to the King  A constant support to the Constitution  And  An unwearied benefactor to every  Body  He was so well acquainted  With the affairs of the House of Commons  And so necessary in their operations  That there was no motion made  To which he was not  Privy  He was easy of access to all  And though his chief companions  Were of a loose disposition  The most modest ladies  Scrupled not to visit him  On any urgent occasion  So great were his good offices  In short  He relieved the poor and needy  And  The rich he sent empty away
