wrongs of my family go forward Charles and procure every intelligence you can gainI shall wait for you within a mile of the Baron's Castle  Exit De Courcy and Attendants  Charles  I will because it is my duty but wou'd I were in Normandy again nothing shou'd induce me to quit it except my regard for so good a master  AIR  Charles  My native land I bade adieu  And calmly Friendship's joys resign'd  But ah how keen my sorrows grew  When my love I left behind  Yet should her truth feel no decay  Should absence prove my charmer kind  Then shall I not lament the day  When my love I left behind  Exit  SCENEThe inside of Maud's Cottage  Enter  Lord William Lady Elinor  and  Cicely  L Eli  Well Palamede I will frankly own to you that the account I hear of the Baron of Oakland's son is far from pleasing me and though I dare not disobey my father yet I will do every thing in my power to delay the marriage  Cice  In short Sir my lady agrees to my scheme of visiting the castle as Lady Elinor's Attendant till she h  ars further from the Baron her father  L Wil  Transporting tidings  TRIO  Lord William Cicely and Lady Elinor  Against the shaft of cruel fate  Why cannot virtue prove a charm

from father to son with the rest of the old furniture  Rob  And a fine tough piece of English Oak you are  Hugo  I remember the death of Edmund Ironside and the restoration of Canute I remember the Harolds and Hardy Canute and the good King Edward the Confessor and I remember the good Baron who now haunts the old Tower  Rob  Hush no more of that  Hugo  Ah Robert if you were old enough to remember what I can  Rob  I am just as well pleased as it is  Hugo  We shall have musick and dancing enough at the wedding I hope Robertfor the honor of Lord Edward  Rob  Yes yes when a man is desperate to at∣tack matrimony the more noise and bustle the better like trumpets in a battle it drowns reflec∣tion and prevents cowardice  Hugo  Are all the pikes and javelins burnished up and the armoury put in order and the large stag's horns in the hall dusted  Rob  Horns are most ominous wedding deco∣rationsNo no friend Hugo I have ordered the horns to be taken down  Hugo  Bless my soul why I remember 'em in the family these fifty years  Rob  For which reason the young lady ought not to see them  Hugo  Then is the Lady Elinor very beauteous Robert  Rob  Why do you ask Hugo do you admire beauty yet  Hugo  Oh yes Robert I never could yet behold a beauteous woman without admiration the setting sun may surely cheer my sight tho' it cannot warm my heart  Exit  Rob  I hope Adela has got

You did ma'am  Adela  And anxious to pay my respects to the Baron of Oakland left my servants on the road  Rob  Yes ma'am  Adela  O but there's one material circumstance I have forgot I don't know who

that the King wrote to your father recommending this marriage  Adela  Well I'll endeavour to recollect if I can but you know it is not very strange I shou'd for∣get what never happened  Rob  Well

faults with a good deal of pleasure  Bar  All my faults aye she has found me out already  Aside  Why to be sure my lady we all have faults but if one is of a good family you know my lady it does'nt so much signify  Adela  O to be sure not for though some peo∣ple are a little aukward and bashful before company yet I don't think they are a bit the worse for that  Bar  No nothat's a hit at me  Aside

Castle continue your disguise madam but a little longer  L Eli  And do you Palamede recommend dis∣guise you who pretend to be a lover  AIR  Lady Elinor  Hush hush such counsels do not give  A lover's name profaning  And can her heart deceit advise  Where mighty love is reigning  Dissimulation's path you've trod  Too oft to go astray  And whilst to me you point the road  Your footsteps mark the way  Enter  Cicely  Cice  Oh madam here comes the old Baron but pray think of something melancholy or you will certainly laugh nature and art have made him such a strange animal that he seems only to be laugh'd at but here he is  L Wil  And is this the representation of our family degrading thought but I must dissemble  Aside  Enter the  Baron  Bar  To Cicely  So you are an attendant on lady Elinor de Courcy hey but who's that  pointing to Lady Elinor  Cice  Oh that's my lady's own waiting woman and a very great favourite of my lady's SirI assure you  Bar  She must be a great favorite of every body's for she's a monstrous pretty girl and pray who is that gentleman is he a favorite of your ladyship's  pointing to Lord William  Cice  O no that isthat is Sir Palamede the Baron's Jester  L Wil  A curious character she has assigned me but I must carry it on  Aside  Bar  Why jesting is a very pleasant employment to be sure though not a very profitable oneI  shou'd thinkhark'ye friend don't you some∣times get a bone crack'd  L Wil  You are mistaken my lord we jesters are privileged people we anatomize vice and folly  Bar  Ay that is you cut up people by way of amusement  L Wil  Improvement my lordsatire well applied is the medicine of the mind  Bar  That may be but I don't take physic so you may spare your trouble and so the baron pays you for jesting hey that's one way of enjoying a jest at his own expence but I shou  d think now so goodnatured as the world is that he might contrive to get laugh'd at Gratis  L Wil  Your lordship finds it so I have no doubt now as a specimen  AIR  Lord William  Tho' time has from your lordship's face  Made free to steal each youthful grace  Yet why should you despair  Old busts oft please the connoisseurs  So folks of taste perhaps like yours  And that removes your care  'Tis true that silly girls believe  In joys that youth alone can give  But why shou'd you despair  'Tis folly governs youth you know  And so far young you soon may grow  So that removes your care  Whate'er your faults in person mind  However gross you chance to find  Yet why should you despair  Of flattery you must buy advice  You're rich enough to pay the price  So that removes your care  Bar  Ah that's another hit at me but I dare not resent it  Aside  well but if you are attendants on the lady Elinor de Courcy where have you been all this while  Cice  Oh Sir we have left my lady behind on the road  Bar  Your lady has left you behind you meanwhy she's here in the castle  L Wil  Indeed  Bar  Yes indeed Mr Jesthunter and I am going to give her ladyship audience in my Great Halland if we want any body to laugh atwe'll send for youthere I hit him I think  Exit  L Eli  What can he meangive me your ad∣vice Palamede  Cice  Ah madam you forgot that Sir Palamede is a lover and consequently advice is a commodity he does'nt deal in but if you will take my opinion ma'am  L Wil  Well  Cice  It is plain some imposter has assumed your ladyship's name for what purpose we must endea∣vour to find out therefore suppose we continue our disguise wait on the mock lady Elinor overturn her with respect and confound her with courtesy  L Wil  Admirable  Enter  Lewis  with letters which he delivers to  Lord William  Lew  Sir the messenger is return'd and brought these lettersAye madam your shadow is here before you find  L Eli  Hush not a word I charge you from whom are those letters  Aside to Lewis  Lew  That's what I want to know I wish you wou'd ask Sir Palamede the question  L Wil  Lady Elinor every moment furnishes additiona  reasons for requesting you will be guided by Cicely's advice  Exit with Lady Elinor  Lew  Ah Cicely there they go a pair of as true turtles as ever bill'dOh what a fine thing mutual love is if you wou'd but let us follow their example
