duke Prospero I'm a lubber if I think him a jot better than an old wizard  TRINCULO  Between ourselves boatswain I take him to be a kind of friar Bacon or doctor Faustus that I heard so many tales about in England and like them he has sold himself to the devil in the next world that he may be able to play  the devil in this which he did with a ven∣geance when he wreck'd us on this isle of

dare to walk the deck after dark Stephano much less keep watch there all night as he once said we should for dread of spirits and hobgoblins  STEPHANO  The bare thought of it gives me the shaking

I might no more be slouted at and mock'd  They call'd me servantmonster mooncalf fish  Perchance they'll think I am more manlike now  It may be but I am not near so warm  A shaggy hide from the chill

i'th' night we might have done't  Instead of this 'would I had stay'd behind  In yon' lone isle to reign a rock my throne  And been both lord and subject to myself  SEBASTIAN  But will you hear think not I mean you should  Through Milanstreets page Prospero's proud heels  Like captive king in Roman victor's train  ANTHONIO  Nor will I ever come what may instead  Death to be hooted by a senseless rabble  The scorn of slaves who knelt i' th' mire to me  Deserted and despis'd no refuge left  Unless to shave my crown turn whining monk  And supplicate for scanty dole of bread  SEBASTIAN  You apprehend too quickly I no more  Than you mean tamely to return and live  Obscure in Naples where I thought to rule  And yet intend as thou may'st still in Milan  ANTHONIO  At length thou speak'st say on I am all attention  SEBASTIAN  Vainly 'gainst Prosp'ro's art we had contended  But mark our fortune ere on board he came  His wand he brake and drown'd his magick book  Foregoing nay abjuring most foollike  The only means by which we had been foil'd  ANTHONIO  'Tis true  SEBASTIAN  We're equal now and by a deed  The world were't known might villainy miscall  Ere we arrive at Italy's lov'd shore  We'll lay in an eternal dreamless sleep  Alonso Prosp'ro Ferdinand nay all  ANTHONIO  Impossible so closely we're observ'd  SEBASTIAN  Go to to men like us resolv'd 'tis easy  For in the night whose next morn lights us home  Can we but get the boat nay even a plank  Whereon to float ourselves to th' crew unknown  We'll sink or fire the ship whence none can 'scape  Then to th' amazed multitude on shore  With hypocritick wailing tell a tale  Of wreck and deaths and reign compleatly blest  ANTHONIO  My Delphick oracle it shall be done  I' th' ship shall they find death i' th' sea a grave  Where

condemn'd to die  For murder lust and sorcery  When I had stol'n for sacrifice  To Setebos a child the cries  Of it's sad parents wide misled  Made me restore it to their bed  Fool that I was but

curtain is withdrawn and the clear morn  Blushes like bashful bride from couch upris'n  Whose yellow tresses all dishevell'd throw  A golden glare around creating day  But what is day after drear nights like mine  From my sweet bride withheld my Claribel  Yet wherefore do I thus indulge despair  Still may I hope to be deliver'd hence  Still hope I shall regain my crown and throne  From which as in a dream my queen and self  By Hyrca's sorcery were hither brought  Me for her brutal lust detested hag  And my fair bride her lowdegraded slave  But soft I hear the hasteful step of love  'Tis Claribel fly sorrow from my breast  For where she comes nought can abide but joy  Enter  Claribel  CLARIBEL  My dear Abdallah mine and Tunis' lord  Fain would I greet thee with a happy day  But the fell sorceress Hyrca wild with ire  That her foul passion still you treat with scorn  Since midnight hath been working spells and charms  The prelude of our doom'd destruction nigh  ABDALLAH  Were't but myself her wicked pow'r could reach  I'd meet her utmost fury with a smile  Yielding my firm and unpolluted flesh  By fiery pincers to be burnt and torn  CLARIBEL  And thinks my love that only him would harm  Thou know'st whate'er of ill should thee betide  Must wound the lovefraught heart of Claribel  But for some hope to mitigate this fear  As on the ocean's marge e'en now I gaz'd  I saw a gallant vessel furl her sails  Whilst from her boat stept divers on the shore  And see dear lord already they approach  Enter  Prospero  and  Miranda  MIRANDA  'Beseech you sir venture no farther on

CLARIBEL  Heard you Abdallah what this stranger said  ABDLLAH  Dearest I did and am abforb'd in wonder  'Please you grave sir approach and you fair maid  Nor lack for aught save what we also want  Enter  Ferdinand  his sword drawn and soon after  Alonso Adrian  and  Francisco  FERDINAND  The beast no longer seems invulnerable  But shuns my sword and with his foul compeers  Growling a different

honour'd sire  Whom to behold again was past my hope  Fly with your goodly company this place  And rescue hence your Claribel and son  But if that may not be secure yourselves  ALONSO  Explain my son declare what ill awaits  ABDALLAH  Here bides a potent sorceress by whose art  From Tunis we were hither strangely brought  Soon as your royal fleet had homeward sail'd  Myself the object of her foul desire  My virginqueen in bondage basely held  Her the vile witch would elsewhere fain have stay'd  But had not pow'r and though till now debarr'd  Due nuptial rites on each returning morn  Like th' eastern sun she glads my longing eye  For even witchcraft can't divide the pair  Whose lovelink'd hearts are holily conjoin'd  PROSPERO  Mysterious Heav'n sure pointed out the path  To free from hence

most resemble me tho' fairer far  CLARIBEL  Thy speech is passing strange but if't be sooth  Thy innocence deceives thee overmuch  No more can I a woman like thyself  Compare with thee true type of Beauty's queen  Than can with Ferdinand the moor my lord  Whom ne'ertheless past health and life I love  MIRANDA  What that dark creature'tis impossible  As soon the swan might on the raven dote  CLARIBEL  I thought like thee when first I saw the moor  And almost loath'd where duty bade me love  But my Abdallah has a snowwhite soul  Which o'er his hue a beamy lustre throws  He won the heart Alonso could not give  And chang'd my mere obedience into choice  Then be not jealous fairest thou'st no cause  Much as a sister should I Ferd'nand love  But not a jot sweet more  MIRANDA  Jealous

nothing in it and the devil take the hindmost  Exeunt  SCENE II THE BEACH  The Remains of the Ship burning  Sycorax  and other Fiends encircling the Fire  A DANCE and CHORUS  AROUND and around  Let the welkin resound  To heighten our pleasures  About the burnt ship  Let us gambol and skip  While in mystical measures  We beat the charm'd ground  After some magical ceremonies  SYCORAX SINGS  MY victims come let Silence reign  Unless the bird of night  To add to their affright  By day to cry shall deign  Or sheeted ghosts howl yell and moan  Or deadly mandrakes shriek and groan  To aggravate their pain  Chorus of Fiends  Let Silence reign  Enter  Hyrca  charming  Abdallah Claribel Miranda  and  Caliban  to follow her at the same time Enter on the opposite side impelled by fiends  Prospero Alonso Ferdinand Gonzalo Adrian  and  Francifco  SYCORAX SPEAKS  Welcome my friend and darling son  These wretches' line is nearly spun  For lo their frames no more can bear  With stony eyes they speechless glare  Now Hyrca shall we vengeance due  Wreak on this curst devoted crew  Done is ev'ry charm and spell  Of melody or dismal yell  With mystick incantations dire  As we circled hellstol'n fire  And crackling flames to ashes turn'd  The vessel we have joyful burn'd  Now speak proud tyrant ere thy breath  For aye expire in horrid death  PROSPERO  Nor this nor direst deeds of hell combin'd  Can shake or alter my still stedfast breast  Conscious I have in nought offended yet  More than inherent frailty of weak man  I know just Heav'n will not permit my fall  But by inscrutable mysterious ways  T' accomplish some outweighing good de∣pendent  Convinc'd of that I bow me to my fate  Yet if you know what means the gentle word  Have pity on my children and lov'd friends  And let my death dread Sycorax appease  SYCORAX  Thy death appease fall'n tyrant no  Thy friends unto thee first I'll show  In torments worse than regicide  Or zealous martyr ever tried  At which if thou dar'st once repine  Their pangs shall be delight to thine  And what I know will irk thee more  Than tortures manifold and sore  Ere thy vile thread of life be spun  Thy daughter will I give my son  CALIBAN  Ho ho ho ho I thank thee gentle dam  Soon shall she bring brave brood of Calibans  PROSPERO  Kneeling  All righteous Providence permit not this  In thee Most High confiding I resign'd  My potent magick which had now bested  Let not thy servant perish for much faith  But if pure chastity seem good to thee  Send down some guardian Angel to defend  And from perdition snatch a spotless maid  Grand Harmonious Musick is heard  Ariel  descends bearing a wand and book attended by other Spirits  THEY SING  VIRTUE is the High One's care  Who to shield it from vile lust  Sends his Spirits of pure air  From the mansions of the just  The Fire sinks  Sycorax Hyrca Caliban  and Fiends go off howling amidst Thunder c  ARIEL  All hail my Heav'ntried master Prospero hail  To recompense your former kindnesses  Hath Ariel div'd i'th' oozy Neptune's bed  Your precious magickvolume rescued thence  And into Tellus' bosom deeply pierc'd  Your broken buried wand recovering  With th' aid of these my fellow ministers  Firm reunited and of greater force  Accept them master from your grateful sprite  You now again have power still use it right  PROSPERO  Heaven heard my prayer to Heaven thanks first are due  Next unto thee my kind my gentle Ariel  And these pure Spirits who vouchsafed their aid  My children lov'd Gonzalo dear friends all  Like monumental marble thus enfix'd  Move

can we thank or praise thee as we ought  PROSPERO  Your thanks and praises offer up to Heaven  Nor Prospero nor e'en Ariel now hath freed you  But the Most High before whose throne all bow  GONZALO  My joints are old and stiff but to my God  No youth with a more supple knee shall bend  ARIEL  Ye favour'd friendsrestoring first this King  And Virgin Queen unto afflicted Tunis  In Italy you'll soon be fully blest  Where by my means inform'd of these events  Gentle and simple old and young now throng  Numerous as sands the shore to greet this train  PROSPERO  But that my chick exceeds my utmost art  Our ship destroy'd we here must patient wait  'Till Heaven hath granted means for our return  ARIEL  That Heaven hath done the sadly homebound fleet  Conducted here by me now joyful waits  To bear you safely hence  The Fleet appears  Once more embark  Ye scatter'd remnants I'm allow'd to save  Haste and be rescued from a living grave  All but th' usurping duke and regicide  Here for their crimes they're ever doom'd to bide  And echo with their groans on this strange shore  Hyrca's dire shrieks curst Caliban's fell roar  Whilst Sycorax replung'd i' th' lake of fire  Shall ne'er be freed till Nature's self expire  PROSPERO  Must then my wretched brother here be left  Him and Sebastian I could now forgive  ARIEL  It may not beHeaven's merciful but just  PROSPERO  Heaven's will be done  ARIEL  Here bend the wond'ring crew  Enter  Master Boatswain  Mariners  Stephano  and  Trinculo  ARIEL  Now farewell allmy duty thus complete  I will but tend to Italy the fleet  And see my master past all perils' power  Then seek repose i' th' bell of some sweet flower  ARIEL SINGS  FROM Bondage free  Sweet Liberty  Shall Ariel hence enjoy  I'th' Bee's quaint Cell  Or Muskrose dwell  Upon the Goss'mer toy  Then sportive fly  To th' azure Sky  Outsoar the Eagle far  In Sunbeams play  The livelong Day  And shine at Night a Star  PROSPERO  My gentle friends ere we depart  A word or two on magickart  Though the dread demons of this hour  To hell and sorcery ow'd their pow'r  Let not all magick be decried  As hellish and unsanctified  Virtue's our magickstaff our book  Pure Pietywith Faith who look  Thereon may antres vast explore  Or fearless hear hoarse Neptune roar  Pervade the endless endless skies  See system upon system rise  Soar to the center of all space  Kneel at the Throne of Heavenly Grace  HYMN  By the attendant Spirits  HAIL Virtue eldest born of Light  Whose ray illumes the darkest cell  Whose presence makes e'en Heaven more bright  With Faith and Piety still dwell  THE END
