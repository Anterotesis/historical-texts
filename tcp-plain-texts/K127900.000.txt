 THE HERMIT  To which are added A HYMN TO CONTENTMENT HEALTH AN ECLOGUE AND A NIGHT PIECE ON DEATH  By Dr THOMAS PARNELL late ArchDeacon of CLOGHER  DROGHEDA  Printed by JOHH FLEMING in WESTSTREET  THE HERMIT  FAR in a Wild unknown to public View  From Youth to Age a rev'rend  Hermit  grew  The Moss his Bed the Cave his humble Cell  His Food the Fruits his Drink the chrystal Well  Remote from Man with God he pass'd the Days  Pray'r all his Bus'ness all his Pleasure Praise  A Life so sacred such serene Repose  Seem'd Heav'n itself 'till one Suggesstion rose  That Vice should triumph Virtue Vice obey  This sprung some Doubt of Providence's Sway  His Hopes no more a certain Prospect boast  And all the Tenour of his Soul is lost  So when a smooth Expanse receives imprest  Calm Nature's Image on it's wat'ry Breast  Down bend the Banks the Trees depending grow  And Skies beneath with answ'ring Colours glow  But if a Stone the gentle Scene divide  Swift ruffling Circles curl on ev'ry Side  And glimmering Fragments of a broken Sun  Banks Trees and Skies in thick Disorder run  To clear this Doubt to know the World by Sight  To find if Books or Swains report it right  For yet by Swains alone the World he knew  Whose Feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly Dew  He quits his Cell the PilgrimStaff he bore  And fix'd the Scallop in his Hat before  Then with the Sun a rising Journey went  Sedate to think and watching each Event  The Morn was wasted in the pathless Grass  And long and lonesome was the Wild to pass  But when the  Southern  Sun had warm'd the Day  A Youth came posting o'er a crossing Way  His Rayment decent his Complexion fair  And soft in graceful Ringlets wav'd his Hair  Then near aproaching Father Hail he cry'd  And Hail my Son the rev'rend Sire reply'd  Words followed Words from Question Answer flow'd  And talk of various kind deceiv'd the Road  'Till each with other pleas'd and loth to part  While in their Age they differ join in Heart  Thus stands an aged Elm and Ivy bound  Thus youthful Ivy clasps an Elm around  Now sunk the sun the closing Hour of Day  Came onward mantled o'er with sober grey  Nature in Silence bid the World repose  When near the Road a stately Palace rose  There by the Moon thro' Ranks of Trees they pass  Whose Verdure crown'd their sloping Sides of Grass  It chanc'd the noble Master of the Dome  Still made his House the wand'ring Strangers home  Yet still the Kindness from a Thirst of Praise  Prov'd the vain Flourish of expensive Ease  The Pair arriv'd the liv'ry Servants wait  The Lord receives them at the pompous Gate  The Table groans with costly Piles of Food  And all is more than Hospitably good  Then led to rest the Day's long Toil they drown  Deep sunk in Sleep and Silk and Heaps of Down  At lenth'tis Morn and at the Dawn of Day  Along the wide Canals the  Zephyrs  Play  Fresh o'er the gay Parterres the Breezes creep  And shake the neigh'bring Wood to banish Sleep  Up rise the Guests obedient to the Call  An early Banquet deck'd the splendid Hall  Rich lucious Wine a golden Goblet grac't  Which the kind Master sorc'd the Guests to taste  Then pleas'd and thankful from the Porch they go  And but the Landlord none had cause of Woe  His  Cup  was vanish'd for in secret Guise  The younger Guest purloin'd the glittering Prize  As one who spiss a Serpent in his Way  Glist'ning and basking in the Summer Ray  Disorder'd stops to shun the Danger near  Then walks with Faintness on and looks with Fear  So seem'd the Sire when far upon the Road  The shining Spoil his wilely Partner show'd  He stopp'd with Silence walk'd with trembling Heart  And much he wish'd but durst not ask to part  Murm'ring he lifts his Eyes and thinks it hard  That generous Actions meet a base Reward  While thus they pass the Sun his Glory shrouds  The changing Skies hang out their Sable Clouds  A Sound in Air presag'd approaching Rain  And Beasts to covert scud across the Plain  Warn'd by the Signs the wand'ring Pair retreat  To seek for Shelter at a neighb'ring Seat  'Twas built with Turrets on a rising Ground  And strong and large unimprov'd around  Its Owner's Temper tim'rous and severe  Unkind and griping caus'd a Desert there  As near the  Miser  's heavy Doors they drew  Fierce rising Gusts with sudden Fury blew  The nimble Light'ning mix'd with Show'rs began  And o'er their Heads loud rolling Thunder ran  Here long they knock but knock or call in vain  Driv'n by the Wind and batter'd by the Rain  At lenth some Pity warm'd the Master's Breast  'Twas then his Threshold first receiv'd a Guest  Slow creaking turns the Door with jealous Care  And half he welcomes in the shivering Pair  One frugal Faggot lights the naked Walls  And Nature's Fervor thro' their Limbs recals  Bread of the coursest sort with eager Wine  Each hardly granted serv'd them both to dine  And when the Tempest first appear'd to cease  A ready warning bid them part in Peace  With still Remark the pond'ring  Hermit  view'd  In one so rich a Life so poor and rude  And why shou'd such within himself he cry'd  Lock the lost Wealth a thousand want beside  But what new Marks of Wonder soon took place  In ev'ry settling Feature of his Face  When from his Vest the young Companion bore  That  Cup  the gen'rous Landlord own'd before  And paid profusely with the precious Bowl  The stinted Kindness of this churlish Soul  But now the Clouds in airy Tumult fly  The Sun emerging ope's an azure Sky  A fresher green the smeling Leaves display  And glitt'ring as they tremble chear the Day  The Weather courts them from the poor Retreat  And the glad Master bolts the wary Gate  While hence they walk the  Pilgrim  's Bosom wrought  With all the Travel of uncertain Thought  His Partner's Acts without their Cause appear  'Twas there a Vice and seem'd a Madness here  Detesting that and pitying this he goes  Lost and confounded with the various Shows  Now Night's dim Shades again involve the Sky  Again the Wand'rers want a Place to lye  Again they search and find a Lodging nigh  The Soil improv'd around the Mansion neat  And neither poorly low nor idly great  It seem'd to speak its Master's turn of Mind  Content and not for Praise but Virtue kind  Hither the Walkers turn with weary Feet  Then bless the Mansion and the Master greet  Their greeting fair bestow'd with modest Guise  The courteous Master hears and thus replies  Without a vain without a grudging Heart  To Him who gives us all I yield a Part  From Him you come from Him accept it here  A frank and sober more than costly Cheer  He spoke and bid the welcome Table spread  Then talk'd of Virtue till the Time of Bed  When the grave Houshold round his Hall repair  Warn'd by a Bell and close the Hours with Pray'r  At length the World renew'd by calm Repose  Was strong for Toil the dappled Morn arose  Before the Pilgrims part the Younger crept  Near the clos'd Cradle where an Infant slept  And writh'd his Neck the Landlord's little Pride  O Strange Return grew black and gasp'd and dy  Horrour of Horrours what his only Son  How look'd our Hermit when the Fact was done  Not Hell tho' Hell's black Jaws in sunder part  And breathe blue Fire cou'd more assault his Hea  Confus'd and struck with Silence at the Deed  He flies but trembling fails to fly with Speed  His Steps the Youth pursues the Country lay  Perplex'd with Roads a Servant show'd the Way  A River cross'd the Path the Passage o'er  Was nice to find the Servant trod before  Long Arms of Oak an open Bridge supply'd  And deep the Waves beneath the Bending glide  The Youth who seem'd to watch a Time to sin  Approach'd the careless Guide and thrust him in  Plunging he falls and rising lists his Head  Then flashing turns and sinks among the Dead  Wild sparkling Rage inflames the Father's Eyes  He bursts the Bands of Fear and madly cries  Detested Wretchbut scarce his Speech began  When the strange Partner seem'd no longer Man  His youthful Face grew more serenely sweet  His Robe turn'd white and flow'd upon his Feet  Fair Rounds of radiant Points invest his Hair  Celestial Odours breathe thro' purpled Air  And Wings whose Colours glitter'd on the Day  Wide at his Back their gradual Plumes display  The Form Etherial bursts upon his Sight  And moves in all the Majesty of Light  Tho' loud at first the Pilgrim's Passion grew  Sudden he gaz'd and wist not what to do  Surprize in secret Chains his Word suspends  And in a Calm his settling Temper ends  But Silence here the beauteous Angel broke  The Voice of Music ravish'd as he spoke  Thy Pray'r thy Praise thy Life to Vice unknown  In sweet Memorial rise before the Throne  These Charms Success in our bright Region find  And force an Angel down to calm thy Mind  For this commission'd I forsook the Sky  Nay cease to kneelthy fellow Servant I  Then know the Truth of Government divine  And let these Scruples be no longer thine  The Maker justly claims that World he made  In this the Right of Providence is laid  Its sacred Majesty thro' all depends  On using second Means to work his Ends  'Tis thus withdrawn in State from human Eye  The Pow'r exerts his Attributes on high  Your Actions uses not controuls your Will  And bids the doubting Sons of Men be still  What strange Events can strike with more Surpriz  Than those which lately strook thy wond'ring Eyes  Yet taught by these confess th'Almighty just  And where you can't unriddle learn to trust  The Great Vain Man who far'd on costly Foo  Whose Life was too luxurious to be good  Who made his Iv'ry Stands with Goblets shine  And forc'd his Guests to morning Draughts of Wine  Has with the Cup the graceless Custom lost  And still he welcomes but with less of Cost  The mean suspicious Wretch whose bolted Door  Ne'er mov'd in Duty to the wand'ring Poor  With him I left the Cup to teach his Mind  That Heav'n can bless if Mortals will be kind  Conscious of wanting Worth he views the Bowl  And feels Compassion touch his grateful Soul  Thus Artists melt the sullen Oar of Lead  With heaping Coals of Fire upon its Head  In the kind Warmth the Metal learns to glow  And loose from Dross the Silver runs below  Long had our pious Friend in Virtue trod  But now the Child halfwean'd his Heart from God  Child of his Age for him he liv'd in Pain  And measur'd back his Steps to Earth again  To what Excesses had his Dotage run  But God to save the Father took the Son  To all but thee in Fits he seem'd to go  And 'twas my Ministry to deal the Blow  The poor fond Parent humbled in the Dust  Now owns in Tears the Punishment was just  But how had all his Fortune felt a Wrack  Had that false Servant sped in Safety back  This Night his treasur'd Heaps he meant to steal  And what a fund of Charity wou'd fail  Thus Heav'n instructs thy Mind This Tryal o'er  Depart in Peace resign and sin no more  On sounding Pinnions here the Youth withdrew  The Sage stood wond'ring as the Seraph flew  Thus look'd Elisha when to mount on high  His Master took the Chariot of the sky  The fiery Pomp ascending left the View  The Prophet gaz'd and wish'd to follow too  The bending Hermit here a Pray'r begun  Lord as in Heaven on Earth thy Will be done  Then gladly turning sought his antient Place  And pass'd a Life of Piety and Peace  A HYMN TO CONTENTMENT  LOvely lasting Peace of Mind  Sweet Delight of human kind  Heavenly born and bred on high  To crown the Fav'rites of the Sky  With more of Happiness below  Than Victors in a Triumph know  Whither O whither art thou fled  To lay thy meek contented Head  What happy Region dost thou please  To make the Seat of Calms and Ease  Ambition searches all its Sphere  Of Pomp and State to meet thee there  Encreasing Avarice would find  Thy Presence in its Gold enshrin'd  The bold Advent'rer ploughs his way  Thro' Rocks amidst the foaming Sea  To gain thy Love and then perceives  Thou wert not in the Rocks and Waves  The silent Heart with Grief assails  Treads soft and lonesome o'er the Vales  Sees Daisies open Rivers run  And seeks as I have vainly done  Amusing Thought but learns to know  That Solitude's the Nurse of Woe  No real Happiness is found  In trailing Purple o'er the Ground  Or in a Soul exalted high  To range the Circuit of the Sky  Converse with Stars above and know  All Nature in its Forms below  The Rest it seeks in seeking dies  And Doubts at last for Knowledge rise  Lovely lasting Peace appear  This World itself if thou art here  Is once again with  Eden  bless'd  And Man contains it in his Breast  'Twas thus as under Shade I stood  I sung my Wishes to the Wood  And lost in thought no more perceiv'd  The Branches whisper as they wav'd  It seem'd as all the quiet Place  Confess'd the Presence of the Grace  When thus she spokeGo rule thy Will  Bid thy wild Passions all be still  Know Godand bring thy Heart to know  The Joys which from Religion flow  Then every Grace shall prove its Guest  And I'll be there to crown the rest  Oh by yonder Mossy Seat  In my Hours of sweet Retreat  Might I thus my Soul employ  With Sense of Gratitude and Joy  Rais'd as ancient Prophets were  In heavenly Vision Praise and Pray'r  Pleasing all Men hurting none  Pleas'd and bless'd with God alone  Then while the Gardens take my Sight  With all the Colours of Delight  While silver Waters glide along  To please my Ear and court my Song  I'll lift my Voice and tune my String  And thee great Source of Nature sing  The Sun that walks his airy Way  To light the World and give the Day  The Moon that shines with borrow'd Light  The Stars that gild the gloomy Night  The Scas that roll unnumber'd Waves  The Wood that spreads its shady Leaves  The Field whose Ears conceal the Grain  The yellow Treasure of the Plain  All of these and all I see  Shou'd be sung and sung by me  They speak their Maker as they can  But want and ask the Tongue of Man  Go search among your idle Dreams  Your busy or your vain Extreams  And find a Life of equal Blifs  Or own the next begun in this  HEALTH AN ECLOGUE  NOW early Shepherds o'er the Meadow pass  And print long footsteps in the glittering grass  The Cows neglectful of their Pasture stand  Turns obsequious to the Milker's Hand  When  Damon  softly trod the shaven Lawn  Damon  a Youth from City Cares withdrawn  ong was the pleasing Walk he wander'd thro'  cover'd Arbour clos'd the distant View

Breast thro' quiv'ring Trees inhale  Thy rosy Blessings with the Morning Gale  What are the Fields or Flow'rs or all I see  Ah tasteless all if not enjoy'd with thee  Joy to my Soul I feel the

turns to  Song  Heare beauteous  Health  for all the Year remai  When the next comes I'll charm thee thus ag  A NIGHT PIECE ON DEATH  BY the blue Tapers trembling Light  No more I waste the wakeful Night  Intent with endless View to pore  The Schoolmen and the Sages o'er  Their Books from Wisdom widely stray  Or point at best the longest Way  I'll seek a readier Path and go  Where Wisdom's surely taught below  How deep yon Azure dies the sky  Where Orbs of Gold unnumber'd lye  While thro' their Ranks in silver pride  The nether Crescent seems to glide  The slumb'ring Breeze forgets to breathe  The Lake is smooth and clear beneath  Where once again the spangle Snow  Descends to meet our Eyes below  The Grounds which on the right aspire  In dimness from the View retire  The Left presents a Place of Graves  Whose Wall the silent Water leaves  That Steeple guides thy doubtful sight  Among the livid gleams of Night  There pass with melancholly State  By all the solemn Heaps of Fate  And think as softlysad you tread  Above the venerable Dead  Time was like thee they Life possest  And Time shall be that thou shalt Rest  Those Graves with bending Osier bound  That nameless heave the crumbled Ground  Quick to the glancing Thought disclose  Where Toil and Poverty repose  The flat smooth Stones that bear a Name  The Chissel's slender help to Fame  Which e'er our Set of Friends decay  Their frequent Steps may wear away  A middle Race of Mortals own  Men half ambitious all unknown  The Marble Tombs that rise on high  Whose Dead in vaulted Arches lye  Whose Pillars swell with sculptur'd Stones  Arms Angels Epitaphs and Bones  These all the poor Remains of State  Adorn the Rich or praise the Great  Who while on Earth in Fame they live  Are senseless of the Fame they give  Ha while I gaze pale  Cynthia  fades  The bursting Earth unveils the Shades  All slow and wan and wrap'd with Shrouds  They rise in visionary Crouds  And all with sober Accent cry  Think Mortal what it is to dye  Now from yon black and fun'ral Yew  That bathes the Charnel House with Dew  Methinks I hear a Voice begin  Ye Ravens cease your croaking Din  Ye tollings Clocks no Time resound  O'er the long Leak and midnight Ground  It sends a Peal of hollow Groans  Thus speaking from among the Bones  When Men my Scythe and Darts supply  How great a King of Fears am I  They view me like the last of Things  They make and then they dread my Stings  Fools if you less provok'd your Fears  No more my SpectreForm appears  Death's but a Path that must be trod  If Man wou'd ever pass to God  A Port of Calms a State of Ease  From the rough Rage of swelling Seas  Why then thy flowing Sable Stoles  Deep pendent Cypress mourning Poles  Loose Scarfs to fall athwart thy Weeds  Long Palls drawn Herses cover'd Steeds  And Plumes of black that as they tread  Nod o'er the 'Scutcheons of the Dead  Nor can the parted Body know  Nor wants the Soul these Forms of woe  As Men who long in Prison dwell  With Lamps that glimmer round the Cell  When e'er their suffering Years are run  Spring forth to greet the glitt'ring Sun  Such Joy tho' far transcending Sense  Have pious Souls at parting hence  On Earth and in the Body plac't  A few and evil Years they waste  But when their Charms are cast aside  See the glad Scene unfolding wide  Clap the glad Wing and tow'r away  And mingle with the Blaze of Day  FINIS
