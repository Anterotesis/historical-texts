object of resentment appears to deserve punishment  CHAP II Of the proper objects of gratitude and resentment  CHAP III That where there is no approbation of the conduct of the person who confers the benefit there is little sympathy with the gratitude of him who receives it and that on the contrary where there is no disapprobation of the motives of the person who does the mischief there is no sort

fashion upon our notion of beauty and deformity  SECT II Of the influence of custom and fashion upon moral sentiments  PART VI Of Systems of Moral Philosophy  SECT I Of the questions which ought to be

been formed concerning the principle of approbation  CHAP I Of those systems which deduce the principle of approbation from selflove  CHAP II Of those systems which make reason the principle of approbation  CHAP III Of those systems which make sentiment the principle of approbation  SECT IV Of the manner in which different authors have treated of the practical rules of morality  PART I Of the PROPRIETY of ACTION  SECTION I Of SYMPATHY  HOW selfish soever man may be supposed there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others and render their happiness necessary to him though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it Of this kind is pity or compassion the emotion which we feel for the misery of others when we either see it or are made to conceive it in a very lively manner That we often derive sorrow from the sorrow of others is too obvious to require any instances to prove it for this sentiment like all the other original passions of human nature  is by no means confined to the virtuous and humane though they perhaps may feel it with the most exquisite sensibility The greatest ruffian the most hardened violator of the laws of society is not altogether without it  As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel we can form no idea of the manner in which they are affected but by conceiving what we ourselves should feel in the like situation Though our brother is upon the rack as long as we are at our ease our senses will never inform us of what he suffers They never did and never can carry us beyond our own persons and it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations Neither can that faculty help us to this any other way than by representing to us what would be our own if we were in his case It is the impressions of our own senses only not those of his which our imaginations copy By the imagination we place ourselves in his situation we conceive ourselves enduring all the same torments we enter as it were into his body and become in some measure him and  thence form some idea of his sensations and even feel something which though weaker in degree is not altogether unlike them His agonies when they are thus brought home to ourselves when we have thus adopted and made them our own begin at last to affect us and we then tremble and shudder at the thought of what he feels For as to be in pain or distress of any kind excites the most excessive sorrow so to conceive or to imagine that we are in it excites some degree of the same emotion in proportion to the vivacity or dulness of the conception  That this is the source of our fellowfeeling for the misery of others that it is by changing places in fancy with the sufferer that we come either to conceive or to be affected by what he feels may be demonstrated by many obvious observations if it should not be thought sufficiently evident of itself When we see a stroke aimed and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person we naturally shrink and draw back our own leg or our own arm and when it does fall we feel it in some measure and are hurt by it as well as the sufferer The mob when they  are gazing at a dancer on the slack rope naturally writhe and twist and balance their own bodies as they see him do and as they feel that they themselves must do in his situation Persons of delicate fibres and a weak constitution of body complain that in looking on the sores and ulcers that are exposed by beggars in the streets they are apt to feel an itching or uneasy sensation in the correspondent part of their own bodies The horror which they conceive at the misery of those wretches affects that particular part in themselves more than any other because that horror arises from conceiving what they themselves would suffer if they really were the wretches whom they are looking upon and if that particular part in themselves was actually affected in the same miserable manner The very force of this conception is sufficient in their feeble frames to produce that itching or uneasy sensation complained of Men of the most robust make observe that in looking upon sore eyes they often feel a very sensible soreness in their own which proceeds from the same reason that organ being in the strongest man more delicate than  any other part of the body is in the weakest  Neither is it those circumstances only which create pain or sorrow that call forth our fellowfeeling Whatever is the passion which arises from any object in the person principally concerned an analagous emotion springs up at the thought of his situation in the breast of every attentive spectator Our joy for the deliverance of those heroes of tragedy or romance who interest us is as sincere as our grief for their distress and our fellowfeeling with their misery is not more real than that with their happiness We enter into their gratitude towards those faithful friends who did not desert them in their difficulties and we heartily go along with their resentment against those perfidious traitors who injured abandoned or deceived them In every passion of which the mind of man is susceptible the emotions of the bystander always correspond to what by bringing the case home to himself he imagines should be the sentiments of the sufferer  Pity and compassion are words appropriated to signify our fellowfeeling with  the sorrow of others Sympathy though its meaning was perhaps originally the same may now however without much impropriety be made use of to denote our fellowfeeling with any passion whatever  Upon some occasions sympathy may seem to arise meerly from the view of a certain emotion in another person The passions upon some occasions may seem to be transfused from one man to another instantaneously and antecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the person principally concerned Grief and joy for example strongly expressed in the look and gestures of any one at once affect the spectator with some degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion A smiling face is to every body that sees it a chearful object as a sorrowful countenance on the other hand is a melancholy one  This however does not hold universally with regard to every passion There are some of which the expressions excite no sort of sympathy but before we are acquainted with what gave occasion to them serve rather to disgust and provoke  us against them The furious behaviour of an angry man is more likely to exasperate us against himself than against his enemies As we are unacquainted with his provocation we cannot bring his case home to ourselves nor conceive any thing like the passions which it excites But we plainly see what is the situation of those with whom he is angry and to what violence they may be exposed from so enraged an adversary We readily therefore sympathize with their fear or resentment and are immediately disposed to take party against the man from whom they appear to be in so much danger  If the very appearances of grief and joy inspire us with some degree of the like emotions it is because they suggest to us the general idea of some good or bad fortune that has befallen the person in whom we observe them and in these passions this is sufficient to have some little influence upon us The effects of grief and joy terminate in the person who feels those emotions of which the expressions do not like those of resentment suggest to us the idea of any other person for whom we are concerned and  whose interests are opposite to his The general idea of good or bad fortune therefore creates some concern for the person who has met with it but the general idea of provocation excites no sympathy with the anger of the man who has received it Nature it seems teaches us to be more averse to enter into this passion and till informed of its cause to be disposed rather to take part against it  Even our sympathy with the grief or joy of another before we are informed of the cause of either is always extremely imperfect General lamentations which express nothing but the anguish of the sufferer create rather a curiosity to enquire into his situation along with some disposition to sympathize with him than any actual sympathy that is very sensible The first question that we ask is What has befallen you 'Till this be answered tho' we are uneasy both from the vague idea of his misfortune and still more from torturing ourselves with conjectures about what it may be yet our fellowfeeling is not very considerable  Sympathy therefore does not arise so much from the view of the passion as from that of the situation which excites it We sometimes feel for another a passion of which he himself seems to be altogether incapable because when we put ourselves in his case that passion arises in our breast from the imagination though it does not in his from the reality We blush for the impudence and rudeness of another though he himself appears to have no sense of the impropriety of his own behaviour because we cannot help feeling with what confusion we ourselves should be covered had we behaved in so absurd a manner  Of all the calamities to which the condition of mortality exposes mankind the loss of reason appears to those who have the least spark of humanity by far the most dreadful and they behold that last stage of human wretchedness with deeper commiseration than any other But the poor wretch who is in it laughs and sings perhaps and is altogether insensible of his own misery The anguish which humanity feels therefore at the sight of such an object cannot be the reflection  of any sentiment of the sufferer The compassion of the spectator must arise altogether from the consideration of what he himself would feel if he was reduced to the same unhappy situation and what perhaps is impossible was at the same time able to regard it with his present reason and judgment  What are the pangs of a mother when she hears the moanings of her infant that during the agony of disease cannot express what it feels In her idea of what it suffers she joins to its real helplessness her own consciousness of that helplessness and her own terrors for the unknown consequences of its disorder and out of all these forms for her own sorrow the most complete image of misery and distress The infant however feels only the uneasiness of the present instant which can never be great With regard to the future it is perfectly secure and in its thoughtlessness and want of foresight possesses an antidote against fear and anxiety the great tormentors of the human breast from which reason and philosophy will in vain attempt to defend it when it grows up to a man  We sympathize even with the dead and overlooking what is of real importance in their situation that awful futurity which awaits them we are chiefly affected by those circumstances which strike our senses but can have no influence upon their happiness It is miserable we think to be deprived of the light of the sun to be shut out from life and conversation to be laid in the cold grave a prey to corruption and the reptiles of the earth to be no more thought of in this world but to be obliterated in a little time from the affections and almost from the memory of their dearest friends and relations Surely we imagine we can never feel too much for those who have suffered so dreadful a calamity The tribute of our fellowfeeling seems doubly due to them now when they are in danger of being forgot by every body and by the vain honours which we pay to their memory we endeavour for our own misery artificially to keep alive our melancholy remembrance of their misfortune That our sympathy can afford them no consolation seems to be an addition to their calamity and to think that all we can do is unavailing  and that what alleviates all other distress the regret the love and the lamentation of their friends can yield no comfort to them serves only to exasperate our sense of their misery The happiness of the dead however most assuredly is affected by none of these circumstances nor is it the thought of these things which can ever disturb the security of their repose The idea of that dreary and endless melancholy which the fancy naturally ascribes to their condition arises altogether from our joining to the change which has been produced upon them our own consciousness of that change from our putting ourselves in their situation and from our lodging if I may be allowed to say so our own living souls in their inanimated bodies and thence conceiving what would be our emotions in this case It is this very illusion of the imagination which renders the foresight of our own dissolution so terrible to us and the idea of those circumstances which undoubtedly can give us no pain when we are dead makes us miserable while we are alive And from thence arises one of the most important principles in human nature the dread of death  the great poison to the happiness but the great restraint upon the injustice of mankind which while it afflicts and mortifies the individual guards and protects the society  SECT II Of the sentiment by which we approve or disapprove of the passions and affections of other men as suitable or unsuitable to their objects  CHAP I Of the pleasure of mutual SYMPATHY  BUT whatever may be the cause of sympathy or however it may be excited nothing pleases us more than to observe in other men a fellowfeeling with all the emotions of our own breast nor are we ever so much shocked as by the appearance of the contrary Those who are fond of deducing all our sentiments from certain refinements of selflove think themselves at no loss to account according to their own principles both for this pleasure and this pain Man say they conscious of his own weakness  and of the need which he has for the assistance of others rejoices whenever he observes that they adopt his own passions because he is then assured of that assistance and grieves whenever he observes the contrary because he is then assured of their opposition But both the pleasure and the pain are always felt so instantaneously and often upon such frivolous occasions that it seems evident that neither of them can be derived from any such selfinterested consideration A man is mortified when after having endeavoured to divert the company he looks round and sees that nobody laughs at his jests but himself On the contrary the mirth of the company is highly agreeable to him and he regards this correspondence of their sentiments with his own as the greatest applause  Neither does his pleasure seem to arise altogether from the additional vivacity which his mirth may receive from sympathy with theirs nor his pain from the disappointment he meets with when he misses this pleasure though both the one and the other no doubt do in some  measure When we have read a book or poem so often that we can no longer find any amusement in reading it by ourselves we can still take pleasure in reading it to a companion To him it has all the graces of novelty we enter into the surprize and admiration which it naturally excites in him but which it is no longer capable of exciting in us we consider all the ideas which it presents rather in the light in which they appear to him than in that in which they appear to ourselves and we are amused by sympathy with his amusement which thus enlivens our own On the contrary we should be vexed if he did not seem to be entertained with it and we could no longer take any pleasure in reading it to him It is the same case here The mirth of the company no doubt enlivens our own mirth and their silence no doubt disappoints us But tho' this may contribute both to the pleasure which we derive from the one and to the pain which we feel from the other it is by no means the sole cause of either and this correspondence of the sentiments of others with our own appears to be a cause of  pleasure and the want of it a cause of pain which cannot be accounted for in this manner The sympathy which my friends express with my joy might indeed give me pleasure by enlivening that joy but that which they express with my grief could give me none if it served only to enlieven that grief Sympathy however enlivens joy and alleviates grief It enlivens joy by presenting another source of satisfaction and it alleviates grief by insinuating into the heart almost the only agreeable sensation which it is at that time capable of receiving  It is to be observed accordingly that we are still more anxious to communicate to our friends our disagreeable than our agreeable passions that we derive still more satisfaction from their sympathy with the former than from that with the latter and that we are still more shocked by the want of it  How are the unfortunate relieved when they have found out a person to whom they can communicate the cause of their sorrow Upon his sympathy they seem to disburthen themselves of a part of their distress he is not improperly said to share  it with them He not only feels a sorrow of the same kind with that which they feel but as if he had derived a part of it to himself what he feels seems to alleviate the weight of what they feel Yet by relating their misfortunes they in some measure renew their grief They awaken in their memory the remembrance of those circumstances which occasioned their affliction Their tears accordingly flow faster than before and they are apt to abandon themselves to all the weakness of sorrow They take pleasure however in all this and it is evident are sensibly relieved by it because the sweetness of his sympathy more than compensates the bitterness of that sorrow which in order to excite this sympathy they had thus enlivened and renewed The cruelest insult on the contrary which can be offered to the unfortunate is to appear to make light of their calamities To seem not to be affected with the joy of our companions is but want of politeness but not to wear a serious countenance when they tell us their afflictions is real and gross inhumanity  Love is an agreeable resentment a disagreeable passion and accordingly we are  not half so anxious that our friends should adopt our friendships as that they should enter into our resentments We can forgive them though they seem to be but little affected with the favours which we may have received but lose all patience if they seem indifferent about the injuries which may have been done to us nor are we half so angry with them for not entering into our gratitude as for not sympathising with our resentment They can easily avoid being friends to our friends but can hardly avoid being enemies to those with whom we are at variance We seldom resent their being at enmity with the first though upon that account we may sometimes affect to make an aukward quarrel with them but we quarrel with them in good earnest if in friendship with the last The agreeable passions of love and joy can satisfy and support the heart without any auxiliary pleasure The bitter and painful emotions of grief and resentment more strongly require the healing consolation of sympathy  As the person who is principally interested in any event is pleased with our sympathy and hurt by the want of it so we too seem  to be pleased when we are able to sympathize with him and to be hurt when we are unable to do so We run not only to congratulate the successful but to condole with the afflicted and the pleasure which we find in conversing with a man whom we can entirely sympathise with in all his passions seems to do more than compensate the painfulness of that sorrow with which the view of his situation affects us On the contrary it is always disagreeable to feel that we cannot sympathize with him and instead of being pleased with this exemption from sympathetic pain it hurts us to find that we cannot share his uneasiness If we hear a person loudly lamenting his misfortunes which however upon bringing the case home to ourselves we feel can produce no such violent effect upon us we are shocked at his grief and because we cannot enter into it call it pusillanimity and weakness It gives us the spleen on the other hand to see another too happy or too much elevated as we call it with any little piece of good fortune We are disobliged even with his joy and because we cannot go along with it call it levity  and folly We are even put out of humour if our companion laughs louder or longer at a joke than we think it deserves that is than we feel that we ourselves could laugh at it  CHAP II Of the manner in which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of the affections of other men by their concord or dissonance with our own  WHEN the original passions of the person principally concerned are in perfect concord with the sympathetic emotions of the spectator they necessarily appear to this last just and proper and suitable to their objects and on the contrary when upon bringing the case home to himself he finds that they do not coincide with what he feels they necessarily appear to him unjust and improper and unsuitable to the causes which excite them To approve of the passions of another therefore as suitable to their objects is the same thing as to observe that we intirely sympathize with them and not to approve of them as such is the same thing as to observe that we do not entirely sympathize with them The man who resents the injuries that have been done to me and observes that I resent them precisely as he does necessarily approves of my resentment  The man whose sympathy keeps time to my grief cannot but admit the reasonableness of my sorrow He who admires the same poem or the same picture and admires them exactly as I do must surely allow the justness of my admiration He who laughs at the same joke and laughs along with me cannot well deny the propriety of my laughter On the contrary the person who upon these different occasions either feels no such emotion as that which I feel or feels none that bears any proportion to mine cannot avoid disapproving my sentiments on account of their dissonance with his own If my animosity goes beyond what the indignation of my friend can correspond to if my grief exceeds what his most tender compassion can go along with if my admiration is either too high or too low to tally with his own if I laugh loud and heartily at what he only smiles or on the contrary only smile when he laughs loud and heartily in all these cases as soon as he comes from considering the object to observe how I am affected by it according as there is more or less disproportion between his sentiments and mine I  must incur a greater or less degree of his disapprobation and upon all occasions his own sentiments are the standards and measures by which he judges of mine  To approve of another man's opinions is to adopt those opinions and to adopt them is to approve of them If the same arguments which convince you convince me likewise I necessarily approve of your conviction and if they do not I necessarily disapprove of it neither can I possibly conceive that I should do the one without the other To approve or disapprove therefore of the opinions of others is acknowledged by every body to mean no more than to observe their agreement or disagreement with our own But this is equally the case with regard to our approbation or disapprobation of the sentiments or passions of others  There are indeed some cases in which we seem to approve without any sympathy or correspondence of sentiments and in which consequently the sentiment of approbation would seem to be different from the perception of this coincidence A little attention however will convince us that even in these cases our approbation  is ultimately founded upon a sympathy or correspondence of this kind I shall give an instance in things of a very frivolous nature because in them the judgments of mankind are less apt to be perverted by wrong systems We may often approve of a jest and think the laughter of the company quite just and proper though we ourselves do not laugh because perhaps we are in a grave humour or happen to have our attention engaged with other objects We have learned however from experience what sort of pleasantry is upon most occasions capable of making us laugh and we observe that this is one of that kind We approve therefore of the laughter of the company and feel that it is natural and suitable to its object because though in our present mood we cannot easily enter into it we are sensible that upon most occasions we should very heartily join in it  The same thing often happens with regard to all the other passions A stranger passes by us in the street with all the marks of the deepest affliction and we are immediately told that he has just received the news of the death of his father It is impossible that in this case we should not  approve of his grief Yet it may often happen without any defect of humanity on our part that so far from entering into the violence of his sorrow we should scarce conceive the first movements of concern upon his account Both he and his father perhaps are intirely unknown to us or we happen to be employed about other things and do not take time to picture out in our imagination the different circumstances of distress which must occur to him We have learned however from experience that such a misfortune naturally excites such a degree of sorrow and we know that if we took time to consider his situation fully and in all its parts we should without doubt most sincerely sympathize with him It is upon the consciousness of this conditional sympathy that our approbation of his sorrow is founded even in those cases in which that sympathy does not actually take place and the general rules derived from our preceding experience of what upon most occasions our sentiments would correspond with correct the impropriety of our present emotions  The sentiment or affection of the heart from which any action proceeds and upon which its whole virtue or vice must ultimately depend may be considered under two different aspects or in two different relations first in relation to the cause that excites it or the motive that gives occasion to it and secondly in relation to the end that it proposes or the effect that it tends to produce  In the suitableness or unsuitableness in the proportion or disproportion which the affection seems to bear to the cause or object which excites it consists the propriety or impropriety the decency or ungracefulness of the consequent action  In the beneficial or hurtful nature of the effects which the affection aims at or tends to produce consists the merit or demerit of the action the qualities by which it is entitled to reward or is deserving of punishment  Philosophers have of late years considered chiefly the tendency of affections and have given little attention to the relation which they stand in to the cause which excites them In common life however when we judge of any person's conduct and of  the sentiments which directed it we constantly consider them under both these aspects When we blame in another man the excesses of love of grief of resentment we not only consider the ruinous effects which they tend to produce but the little occasion which was given for them The merit of his favourite we say is not so great his misfortune is not so dreadful his provocation is not so extraordinary as to justify so violent a passion We should have indulged we say perhaps have approved of the violence of his emotion had the cause been in any respect proportioned to it  When we judge in this manner of any affection as proportioned or disproportioned to the cause which excites it it is scarce possible that we should make use of any other rule or canon but the correspondent affection in ourselves If upon bringing the case home to our own breast we find that the sentiments which it gives occasion to coincide and tally with our own we necessarily approve of them as proportioned and suitable to their objects if otherwise we necessarily disapprove of them as extravagant and out of proportion  Every faculty in one man is the measure by which he judges of the like faculty in another I judge of your sight by my sight of your ear by my ear of your reason by my reason of your resentment by my resentment of your love by my love I neither have nor can have any other way of judging about them  CHAP III The same subject continued  WE may judge of the propriety or impropriety of the sentiments of another person by their correspondence or disagreement with our own upon two different occasions either first when the objects which excite them are considered without any peculiar relation either to ourselves or to the person whose sentiments we judge of or secondly when they are considered as peculiarly affecting one or other of us  With regard to those objects which are considered without any peculiar relation either to ourselves or to the person whose sentiments we judge of wherever his sentiments intirely correspond with our own we ascribe to him the qualities of taste and good judgment The beauty of a plain the greatness of a mountain the ornaments of a building the expression of a picture the composition of a discourse the conduct of a third person the proportions of different quantities and numbers the various appearances  which the great machine of the universe is perpetually exhibiting with the secret wheels and springs which produce them in a word all the general subjects of science and taste are what we and our companion regard as having no peculiar relation to either of us We both look at them from the same point of view and we have no occasion for sympathy or for that imaginary change of situations from which it arises in order to produce with regard to these the most perfect harmony of sentiments and affections If notwithstanding we are often differently affected it arises either from the different degrees of attention which our different habits of life allow us to give easily to the several parts of those complex objects or from the different degrees of natural acuteness in the faculty of the mind to which they are addressed  When the sentiments of our companion coincide with our own in things of this kind which are obvious and easy and in which perhaps we never found a single person who differed from us though we no doubt must approve of them yet he seems to deserve no praise of admiration on account of them But when they  not only coincide with our own but lead and direct our own when in forming them he appears to have attended to many things which we had overlooked and to have adjusted them to all the various circumstances of their objects we not only approve of them but wonder and are surprised at their uncommon and unexpected acuteness and comprehensiveness and he appears to deserve a very high degree of admiration and applause For approbation heightned by wonder and surprise constitutes the sentiment which is properly called admiration and of which applause is the natural expression The decision of the man who judges that exquisite beauty is preferable to the grossest deformity or that twice two are equal to four must certainly be approved of by all the world but will not surely be much admired It is the acute and delicate discernment of the man of taste who distinguishes the minute and scarce perceptible differences of beauty and deformity it is the comprehensive accuracy of the experienced mathematician who unravels with ease the most intricate and perplexed proportions it is the great leader in science and taste the  man who directs and conducts our own sentiments the extent and superior justness of whose talents astonish us with wonder and surprise who excites our admiration and seems to deserve our applause and upon this foundation is grounded the greater part of the praise which is bestowed upon what are called the intellectual virtues  The utility of those qualities it may be thought is what first recommends them to us and no doubt the consideration of this when we come to attend to it gives them a new value Originally however we approve of another man's judgment not as something useful but as right as accurate as agreeable to truth and reality and it is evident we attribute those qualities to it for no other reason but because we find that it agrees with our own Taste in the same manner is originally approved of not as useful but as just as delicate and as precisely suited to its object The idea of the utility of all qualities of this kind is plainly an afterthought and not what first recommends them to our approbation  With regard to those objects which affect in a particular manner either ourselves or the person whose sentiments we judge of it is at once more difficult to preserve this harmony and correspondence and at the same time vastly more important My companion does not naturally look upon the misfortune that has befallen me or the injury that has been done me from the same point of view in which I consider them They affect me much more nearly We do not view them from the same station as we do a picture or a poem or a system of philosophy and are therefore apt to be very differently affected by them But I can much more easily overlook the want of this correspondence of sentiments with regard to such indifferent objects as concern neither me nor my companion than with regard to what interests me so much as the misfortune that has befallen me or the injury that has been done me Though you despise that picture or that poem or even that system of philosophy which I admire there is little danger of our quarrelling upon that account Neither of us can reasonably be  much interested about them They ought all of them to be matters of great indifference to us both so that though our opinions may be opposite our affections may still be very nearly the same But it is quite otherwise with regard to those objects by which either you or I are particularly affected Though your judgments in matters of speculation though your sentiments in matters of taste are quite opposite to mine I can easily overlook this opposition and if I have any degree of temper I may still find some entertainment in your conversation even upon those very subjects But if you have either no fellowfeeling for the misfortunes I have met with or none that bears any proportion to the grief which distracts me or if you have either no indignation at the injuries I have suffered or none that bears any proportion to the resentment which transports me we can no longer converse upon these subjects We become intolerable to one another I can neither support your company nor you mine You are confounded at my violence and passion and I am enraged at your cold insensibility and want of feeling  In all such cases that there may be some correspondence of sentiments between the spectator and the person principally concerned the spectator must first of all endeavour as much as he can to put himself in the situation of the other and to bring home to himself every little circumstance of distress which can possibly occur to the sufferer He must adopt the whole case of his companion with all its minutest incidents and strive to render as perfect as possible that imaginary change of situation upon which his sympathy is founded  After all this however the emotions of the spectator will still be very apt to fall short of the violence of what is felt by the sufferer Mankind though naturally sympathetic never conceive for what has befallen another that degree of passion which naturally animates the person principally concerned That imaginary change of situation upon which their sympathy is founded is but momentary The thought of their own safety the thought that they themselves are not really the sufferers continually intrudes itself upon them and though it does not hinder them  from conceiving a passion somewhat analogous to what is felt by the sufferer hinders them from conceiving any thing that approaches to the same degree of violence The person concerned is sensible of this and at the same time passionately desires a more compleat sympathy He longs for that relief which nothing can afford him but the entire concord of the affections of the spectators with his own To see the emotions of their hearts in every respect beat time to his own in the violent and disagreeable passions constitutes his sole consolation But he can only hope to obtain this by lowering his passion to that pitch in which the spectators are capable of going along with him He must flatten if I may be allowed to say so the sharpness of its natural tone in order to reduce it to harmony and concord with the emotions of those who are about him What they feel will indeed always be in some respects different from what he feels and compassion can never be exactly the same with original sorrow because the secret consciousness that the change of situations from which the sympathetic sentiment arises is but imaginary not only lowers  it in degree but in some measure varies it in kind and gives it a quite different modification These two sentiments however may it is evident have such a correspondence with one another as is sufficient for the harmony of society Though they will never be unisons they may be concords and this is all that is wanted or required  In order to produce this concord as nature teaches the spectators to assume the circumstances of the person principally concerned so she teaches this last in some measure to assume those of the spectators As they are continually placing themselves in his situation and thence conceiving emotions similar to what he feels so he is as constantly placing himself in theirs and thence conceiving some degree of that coolness about his own fortune with which he is sensible that they will view it As they are constantly considering what they themselves would feel if they actually were the sufferers so he is as constantly led to imagine in what manner he would be affected if he was only one of the spectators of his own situation As their sympathy makes them look at it in some measure with his  eyes so his sympathy makes him look at it in some measure with theirs especially when in their presence and acting under their observation and as the reflected passion which he thus conceives is much weaker than the original one it necessarily abates the violence of what he felt before he came into their presence before he began to recollect in what manner they would be affected by it and to view his situation in this candid and impartial light  The mind therefore is rarely so disturbed but that the company of a friend will restore it to some degree of tranquillity and sedateness The breast is in some measure calmed and composed the moment we come into his presence We are immediately put in mind of the light in which he will view our situation and we begin to view it ourselves in the same light for the effect of sympathy is instantaneous We expect less sympathy from a common acquaintance than from a friend we cannot open to the former all those little circumstances which we can unfold to the latter we assume therefore more tranquillity before him and endeavour to fix our thoughts upon those  general outlines of our situation which he is willing to consider We expect still less sympathy from an assembly of strangers and we assume therefore still more tranquillity before them and always endeavour to bring down our passion to that pitch which the particular company we are in may be expected to go along with Nor is this merely an assumed appearance for if we are at all masters of ourselves the presence of a mere acquaintance will really compose us still more than that of a friend and that of an assembly of strangers still more than that of a mere acquaintance  Society and conversation therefore are the most powerful remedies for restoring the mind to its tranquillity if at any time it has unfortunately lost it as well as the best preservatives of that equal and happy temper which is so necessary to selfsatisfaction and enjoyment Men of retirement and speculation who are apt to sit brooding at home over either grief or resentment though they may often have more humanity more generosity and a nicer sense of honour yet seldom possess that equality of temper which is so common among men of the world  CHAP IV Of the amiable and respectable virtues  UPON these two different efforts upon that of the spectator to enter into the sentiments of the person principally concerned and upon that of the person principally concerned to bring down his emotions to what the spectator can go along with are founded two different sets of virtues The soft the gentle and the amiable virtues the virtues of candid condescension and indulgent humanity are founded upon the one the great the awful and respectable the virtues of selfdenial of selfgovernment of that command of the passions which subjects all the movements of our nature to what our own dignity and honour and the propriety of our own conduct require take their origin from the other  How amiable does he appear to be whose sympathetic heart seems to reecho all the sentiments of those with whom he converses who grieves for their calamities who resents their injuries and who rejoices at  their good fortune When we bring home to ourselves the situation of his companions we enter into their gratitude and feel what consolation they must derive from the tender sympathy of so affectionate a friend And for a contrary reason how disagreeable does he appear to be whose hard and obdurate heart feels for himself only but is altogether insensible to the happiness or misery of others We enter in this case too into the pain which his presence must give to every mortal with whom he converses to those especially with whom we are most apt to sympathize the unfortunate and the injured  On the other hand what noble propriety and grace do we feel in the conduct of those who in their own case exert that recollection and selfcommand which constitute the dignity of every passion and which bring it down to what others can enter into We are disgusted with that clamorous grief which without any delicacy calls upon our compassion with sighs and tears and importunate lamentations But we reverence that reserved that silent and majestic sorrow which discovers itself only in the swelling of the eyes  in the quivering of the lips and cheeks and in the distant but affecting coldness of the whole behaviour It imposes the like silence upon us We regard it with respectful attention and watch with anxious concern over our whole behaviour lest by any impropriety we should disturb that concerted tranquillity which it requires so great an effort to support  The insolence and brutality of anger in the same manner when we indulge its fury without check or restraint is of all objects the most detestable But we admire that noble and generous resentment which governs its pursuit of the greatest injuries not by the rage which they are apt to excite in the breast of the sufferer but by the indignation which they naturally call forth in that of the impartial spectator which allows no word no gesture to escape it beyond what this more equitable sentiment would dictate which never even in thought attempts any greater vengeance nor desires to inflict any greater punishment than what every indifferent person would rejoice to see executed  And hence it is that to feel much for others and little for ourselves that to restrain  our selfish and to indulge our benevolent affections constitutes the perfection of human nature and can alone produce among mankind that harmony of sentiments and passions in which consists their whole grace and propriety As to love our neighbour as we love ourselves is the great law of christianity so it is the great precept of nature to love ourselves only as we love our neighbour or what comes to the same thing as our neighbour is capable of loving us  As taste and good judgment when they are considered as qualities which deserve praise and admiration are supposed to imply a delicacy of sentiment and an acuteness of understanding not commonly to be met with so the virtues of sensibility and selfcommand are not apprehended to consist in the ordinary but in the uncommon degrees of those qualities The amiable virtue of humanity requires surely a sensibility much beyond what is possessed by the rude vulgar of mankind The great and exalted virtue of magnanimity undoubtedly demands much more than that degree of selfcommand which the weakest of mortals is capable of exerting As in the common  degree of the intellectual qualities there is no abilities so in the common degree of the moral there is no virtue Virtue is excellence something uncommonly great and beautiful which rises far above what is vulgar and ordinary The amiable virtues consist in that degree of sensibility which surprises by its exquisite and unexpected delicacy and tenderness The awful and respectable in that degree of selfcommand which astonishes by its amazing superiority over the most ungovernable passions of human nature  There is in this respect a considerable difference between virtue and mere propriety between those qualities and actions which deserve to be admired and celebrated and those which simply deserve to be approved of Upon many occasions to act with the most perfect propriety requires no more than that common and ordinary degree of sensibility or selfcommand which the most worthless of mankind are possest of and sometimes even that degree is not necessary Thus to give a very low instance to eat when we are hungry is certainly upon ordinary occasions perfectly right and proper and cannot miss being  approved of as such by every body Nothing however could be more absurd than to say it was virtuous  On the contrary there may frequently be a considerable degree of virtue in those actions which fall short of the most perfect propriety because they may still approach nearer to perfection than could well be expected upon occasions in which it was so extremely difficult to attain it and this is very often the case upon those occasions which require the greatest exertions of selfcommand There are some situations which bear so hard upon human nature that the greatest degree of selfgovernment which can belong to so imperfect a creature as man is not able to stifle altogether the voice of human weakness or reduce the violence of the passions to that pitch of moderation in which the impartial spectator can entirely enter into them Though in those cases therefore the behaviour of the sufferer fall short of the most perfect propriety it may still deserve some applause and even in a certain sense may be denominated virtuous It may still manifest an effort of generosity and magnanimity of which the greater  part of men are incapable and though it fails of absolute perfection it may be a much nearer approximation towards perfection than what upon such trying occasions is commonly either to be found or to be expected  In all cases of this kind when we are determining the degree of blame or applause that seems due to any action we very frequently make use of two different standards The first is the idea of complete propriety and perfection which in those difficult situations no human conduct ever did or ever can come up to and in comparison with which the actions of all men must forever appear blameable and imperfect The second is the idea of that degree of proximity or distance from this complete perfection which the actions of the greater part of men commonly arrive at Whatever goes beyond this degree how far soever it may be removed from absolute perfection seems to deserve applause and whatever falls short of it to deserve blame  It is in the same manner that we judge of the productions of all the arts which address themselves to the imagination When  a critic examines the work of any of the great masters in poetry or painting he may sometimes examine it by an idea of perfection in his own mind which neither that nor any other human work will ever come up to and as long as he compares it with this standard he can see nothing in it but faults and imperfections But when he comes to consider the rank which it ought to hold among other works of the same kind he necessarily compares it with a very different standard the common degree of excellence which is usually attained in this particular art and when he judges of it by this new measure it may often appear to deserve the highest applause upon account of its approaching much nearer to perfection than the greater part of those works which can be brought into competition with it  SECTION III Of the degrees of the different passions which are consistent with propriety  INTRODUCTION  THE propriety of every passion excited by objects peculiarly related to ourselves the pitch which the spectator can go along with must lye it is evident in a certain mediocrity If the passion is too high or if it is too low he cannot enter into it Grief and resentment for private misfortunes and injuries may easily for example be too high and in the greater part of mankind they are so They may likewise though this more rarely happens be too low We denominate the excess weakness and fury and we call the defect stupidity insensibility and want of spirit We can enter into neither of them but are astonished and confounded to see them  This mediocrity however in which the point of propriety consists is different  in different passions It is high in some and low in others There are some passions which it is indecent to express very strongly even upon those occasions in which it is acknowledged we cannot avoid feeling them in the highest degree And there are others of which the strongest expressions are upon many occasions extremely graceful even though the passions themselves do not perhaps arise so necessarily The first are those passions with which for certain reasons there is little or no sympathy the second are those with which for other reasons there is the greatest And if we consider all the different passions of human nature we shall find that they are regarded as decent or indecent just in proportion as mankind are more or less disposed to sympathise with them  CHAP I Of the passions which take their origin from the body  IT is indecent to express any strong degree of those passions which arise from a certain situation or disposition of the body because the company not being in the same disposition cannot be expected to sympathise with them Violent hunger for example though upon many occasions not only natural but unavoidable is always indecent and to eat voraciously is universally regarded as a piece of ill manners There is however some degree of sympathy even with hunger It is agreeable to see our companions eat with a good appetite and all expressions of loathing are offensive The disposition of body which is habitual to a man in health makes his stomach easily keep time if I may be allowed so coarse an expression with the one and not with the other We can sympathise with the distress which excessive hunger occasions when we read the description of it in the journal of a  siege or of a sea voyage We imagine ourselves in the situation of the sufferers and thence readily conceive the grief the fear and consternation which must necessarily distract them We feel ourselves some degree of those passions and therefore sympathise with them but as we do not grow hungry by reading the description we cannot properly even in this case be said to sympathise with their hunger  It is the same case with the passion by which nature unites the two sexes Though naturally the most furious of all the passions all strong expressions of it are upon every occasion indecent even between persons in whom its most compleat indulgence is acknowledged by all laws both human and divine to be perfectly innocent There seems however to be some degree of sympathy even with this passion To talk to a woman as we should to a man is improper it is expected that their company should inspire us with more gaiety more pleasantry and more attention and an intire insensibility to the fair sex renders a  man contemptible in some measure even to the men  Such is our aversion for all the appetites which take their origin from the body all strong expressions of them are loathsome and disagreeable According to some antient philosophers these are the passions which we share in common with the brutes and which having no connection with the characteristical qualities of human nature are upon that account beneath its dignity But there are many other passions which we share in common with  brutes such as resentment natural  and even gratitude which do not upon that account appear to be so brutal▪ The true cause of the peculiar  we conceive for the  body when we see them  men is that we cannot enter into them To the person himself who  them as soon as they are gratified the object that excited them ceases to be agreeable even its presence often becomes offensive to him he looks round to no purpose for the charm which transported him the moment before and he can now as little enter into his own  passion as another person When we have dined we order the covers to be removed and we should treat in the same manner the objects of the most ardent and passionate desires if they were the objects of no other passions but those which take their origin from the body  In the command of those appetites of the body consists that virtue which is properly called temperance To restrain them within those bounds which regard to health and fortune prescribes is the part of prudence But to confine them within those limits which grace which propriety which delicacy and modesty require is the office of temperance  It is for the same reason that to cry out with bodily pain how intolerable soever appears always unmanly and unbecoming There is however a good deal of sympathy even with bodily pain If as has already been observed I see a stroke aimed and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person I naturally shrink and draw back my own leg or my own arm and when it does fall I feel it in some measure and am hurt by it as well as the sufferer My  hurt however is no doubt excessively slight and upon that account if he makes any violent outcry as I cannot go along with him I never fail to despise him And this is the case of all the passions which take their origin from the body they excite either no sympathy at all or such a degree of it as is altogether disproportioned to the violence of what is felt by the sufferer  It is quite otherwise with those passions which take their origin from the imagination The frame of my body can be but little affected by the alterations which are brought about upon that of my companion but my imagination is more ductile and more readily assumes if I may say so the shape and configuration of the imaginations of those wi  h whom I am familiar A disappointment in love or ambition will upon this account call forth more sympathy than the greatest bodily evil Those passions arise altogether from the imagination The person who has lost his whole fortune if he is in health feels nothing in his body What he suffers is from the imagination only which represents to him  the loss of his dignity neglect from his friends contempt from his enemies dependance want and misery coming fast upon him and we sympathise with him more strongly upon this account because our imaginations can more readily mould themselves upon his imagination than our bodies can mould themselves upon his body  The loss of a leg may generally be regarded as a more real calamity than the loss of a mistress It would be a ridiculous tragedy however of which the catastrophe was to turn upon a loss of that kind A misfortune of the other kind how frivolous soever it may appear to be has given occasion to many a fine one  Nothing is so soon forgot as pain The moment it is gone the whole agony of it is over and the thought of it can no longer give us any sort of disturbance We ourselves cannot then enter into the anxiety and anguish which we had before conceived An unguarded word from a friend will occasion a more durable uneasiness The agony which this creates is by no means over with the word What at first disturbs us is not the object of  the senses but the idea of the imagination As it is an idea therefore which occasions our uneasiness till time and other accidents have in some measure effaced it from our memory the imagination continues to fret and rankle within from the thought of it  Pain never calls forth any very lively sympathy unless it is accompanied with danger We sympathise with the fear though not with the agony of the sufferer Fear however is a passion derived altogether from the imagination which represents with an uncertainty and fluctuation that increases our anxiety not what we really feel but what we may hereafter possibly suffer The gout or the toothach tho' exquisitely painful excite very little sympathy more dangerous diseases tho' accompanied with very little pain excite the highest  Some people faint and grow sick at the sight of a chirurgical operation and that bodily pain which is occasioned by tearing the flesh seems in them to excite the most excessive sympathy We conceive in a much more lively and distinct manner the pain which proceeds from an external  cause than we do that which arises from an internal disorder I can scarce form an idea of the agonies of my neighbour when he is tortured with the gout or the stone but I have the clearest conception of what he must suffer from an incision a wound or a fracture The chief cause however why such objects produce such violent effects upon us is their novelty One who has been witness to a dozen dissections and as many amputations sees ever after all operations of this kind with great indifference and often with perfect insensibility Though we have read or seen represented more than five hundred tragedies we shall seldom feel so entire an abatement of our sensibility to the objects which they represent to us  In some of the Greek tragedies there is an attempt to excite compassion by the representation of the agonies of bodily pain Philoctetes cries out and faints from the extremity of his sufferings Hippolytus and Hercules are both introduced as expiring under the severest tortures which it seems even the fortitude of Hercules was incapable of supporting In all these cases however it is not the pain which  interests us but some other circumstance It is not the sore foot but the solitude of Philoctetes which affects us and diffuses over that charming tragedy that romantic wildness which is so agreeable to the imagination The agonies of Hercules and Hippolytus are interesting only because we forsee that death is to be the consequence If those heroes were to recover we should think the representation of their sufferings perfectly ridiculous What a tragedy would that be of which the distress consisted in a cholic Yet no pain is more exquisite These attempts to excite compassion by the representation of bodily pain may be regarded as among the greatest breaches of decorum of which the Greek theatre has set the example  The little sympathy which we feel with bodily pain is the foundation of the propriety of constancy and patience in enduring it The man who under the severest tortures allows no weakness to escape him vents no groan gives way to no passion which we do not entirely enter into commands our highest admiration His firmness enables him to keep time with our indifference and insensibility  We admire and intirely go along with the magnanimous effort which he makes for this purpose We approve of his behaviour and from our experience of the common weakness of human nature we are surprised and wonder how he should be able to act so as to deserve approbation Approbation mixed and animated by wonder and surprize constitutes the sentiment which is properly called admiration of which applause is the natural expression as has already been observed  CHAP II Of those passions which take their origin from a particular turn or habit of the imagination  EVEN of the passions derived from the imagination those which take their origin from a peculiar turn or habit it has acquired though they may be acknowledged to be perfectly natural are however but little sympathised with The imaginations of mankind not having acquired that particular turn cannot enter into them and such passions though they  may be allowed to be almost unavoidable in some part of life are always in some measure ridiculous This is the case with that strong attachment which naturally grows up between two persons of different sexes who have long fixed their thoughts upon one another Our imagination not having run in the same channel with that of the lover we cannot enter into the eagerness of his emotions If our friend has been injured we readily sympathise with his resentment and grow angry with the very person with whom he his angry If he has received a benefit we readily enter into his gratitude and have a very high sense of the merit of his benefactor But if he is in love though we may think his passion just as reasonable as any of the kind yet we never think ourselves bound to conceive a passion of the same kind and for the same person for whom he has conceived it The passion appears to every body but the man who feels it entirely disproportioned to the value of the object and love though it is pardoned in a certain age because we know it is natural is always laughed at because we cannot  enter into it All serious and strong expressions of it appear ridiculous to a third person and if the lover is not good company to his mistress he is to no body else He himself is sensible of this and as long as he continues in his sober senses endeavours to treat his own passion with raillery and ridicule It is the only stile in which we care to hear of it because it is the only stile in which we ourselves are disposed to talk of it We grow weary of the grave pedantic and longsentenced love of Cowley and Propertius who never have done with exaggerating the violence of their attachments but the gaiety of Ovid and the gallantry of Horace are always agreeable  But tho' we feel no proper sympathy with an attachment of this kind tho' we never approach even in imagination towards conceiving a passion for that particular person yet as we either have conceived or may be disposed to conceive passions of the same kind we readily enter into those high hopes of happiness which are proposed from its gratification as well as into that exquisite distress which is feared from its disappointment It interests  us not as a passion but as a situation that gives occasion to other passions which interest us to hope to fear and to distress of every kind In the same manner as in a description of a sea voyage it is not the hunger which interests us but the distress which that hunger occasions Tho' we do not properly enter into the attachment of the lover we readily go along with those expectations of romantic happiness which he derives from it We feel how natural it is for the mind in a certain situation relaxed with indolence and fatigued with the violence of desire to long for serenity and quiet to hope to find them in the gratification of that passion which distracts it and to frame to itself the idea of that life of pastoral tranquillity and retirement which the elegant the tender and the passionate Tibullus takes so much pleasure in describing a life like what the poets describe in the Fortunate Islands a life of friendship liberty and repose free from labour and from care and from all the turbulent passions which attend them Even scenes of this kind interest us most when they are painted rather as what is  hoped than as what is enjoyed The grossness of that passion which mixes with and is perhaps the foundation of love disappears when its gratification is far off and at a distance but renders the whole offensive when described as what is immediately possessed The happy passion upon this account interests us much less than the fearful and the melancholy We tremble for whatever can disappoint such natural and agreeable hopes and thus enter into all the anxiety and concern and distress of the lover  Hence it is that in some modern tragedies and romances this passion appears so wonderfully interesting It is not so much the love of Castalio and Monimia which attaches us in the Orphan as the distress which that love occasions The author who should introduce two lovers in a scene of perfect security expressing their mutual fondness for one another would excite laughter and not sympathy If a scene of this kind is ever admitted into a tragedy it is always in some measure improper and is endured not from any sympathy with the passion that is expressed in it but from concern for the dangers  and difficulties with which the audience foresee that its gratification is likely to be attended  The reserve which the laws of society impose upon the fair sex with regard to this weakness renders it more peculiarly distressful in them and upon that very account more deeply interesting We are charmed with the love of Phaedra as it is expressed in the French tragedy of that name notwithstanding all the extravagance and guilt which attend it That very extravagance and guilt may be said in some measure to recommend it to us Her fear her shame her remorse her horror her despair become thereby more natural and interesting All the secondary passions if I may be allowed to call them so which arise from the situation of love become necessarily more furious and violent and it is with these secondary passions only that we can properly be said to sympathize  Of all the passions however which are so extravagantly disproportioned to the value of their objects love is the only one that appears even to the weakest minds to have any thing in it that is either  graceful or agreeable In itself first of all tho' it may be ridiculous it is not naturally odious and tho' its consequences are often fatal and dreadful its intentions are seldom mischievous And then tho' there is little propriety in the passion itself there is a good deal in some of those which always accompany it There is in love a strong mixture of humanity generosity kindness friendship esteem passions with which of all others for reasons which shall be explained immediately we have the greatest propensity to sympathize even notwithstanding we are sensible that they are in some measure excessive The sympathy which we feel with them renders the passion which they accompany less disagreeable and supports it in our imagination notwithstanding all the vices which commonly go along with it tho' in the one sex it necessarily leads to the last ruin and infamy and tho' in the other where it is apprehended to be least fatal it is almost always attended with an incapacity for labour a neglect of duty a contempt of fame and even of common reputation Notwithstanding all this the degree of sensibility and generosity with  which it is supposed to be accompanied renders it to many the object of vanity and they are fond of appearing capable of feeling what would do them no honour if they had really felt it  It is for a reason of the same kind that a certain reserve is necessary when we talk of our own friends our own studies our own professions All these are objects which we cannot expect should interest our companions in the same degree in which they interest us And it is for want of this reserve that the one half of mankind make bad company to the other A philosopher is company to a philosopher only the member of a club to his own little knot of companions  CHAP III Of the unsocial passions  THERE is another set of passions which tho' derived from the imagination yet before we can enter into them or regard them as graceful or becoming must always be brought down to a pitch much lower than that to which undisciplined  nature would raise them These are hatred and resentment with all their different modifications With regard to all such passions our sympathy is divided between the person who feels them and the person who is the object of them The interests of these two are directly opposite What our sympathy with the person who feels them would prompt us to wish for our fellowfeeling with the other would lead us to fear As they are both men we are concerned for both and our fear for what the one may suffer damps our resentment for what the other has suffered Our sympathy therefore with the man who has received the provocation necessarily falls short of the passion which naturally animates him not only upon account of those general causes which render all sympathetic passions inferior to the original ones but upon account of that particular cause which is peculiar to itself our opposite sympathy with another person Before resentment therefore can become graceful and agreeable it must be more humbled and brought down below that pitch to which it would naturally rise than almost any other passion  Mankind at the same time have a very strong sense of the injuries that are done to another The villain in a tragedy or romance is as much the object of our indignation as the hero is that of our sympathy and affection We detest Iago as much as we esteem Othello and delight as much in the punishment of the one as we are grieved for the distress of the other But tho' mankind have so strong a fellowfeeling with the injuries that are done to their brethren they do not always resent them the more that the sufferer appears to resent them Upon most occasions the greater his patience his mildness his humanity provided it does not appear that he wants spirit or that fear was the motive of his forbearance the higher the resentment against the person who injured him The amiableness of the character exasperates their sense of the atrocity of the injury  These passions however are regarded as necessary parts of the character of human nature A person becomes contemptible who tamely sits still and submits to insults without attempting either to repel or to revenge them We cannot enter into  his indifference and insensibility we call his behaviour meanspiritedness and are as really provoked by it as by the insolence of his adversary Even the mob are enraged to see any man submit patiently to affronts and ill usage They desire to see this insolence resented and resented by the person who suffers from it They cry to him with fury to defend or to revenge himself If his indignation rouses at last they heartily applaud and sympathise with it It enlivens their own indignation against the enemy whom they rejoice to see him attack in his turn and are as really gratified by his revenge provided it is not immoderate as if the injury had been done to themselves  But though the utility of those passions to the individual by rendering it dangerous to insult or injure him be acknowledged and though their utility to the publick as the guardians of justice and of the equality of its administration be not less considerable as shall be shewn hereafter yet there is still something disagreeable in the passions themselves which makes the appearance of them in other men the natural object of our aversion  The expression of anger towards any body present if it exceeds a bare intimation that we are sensible of his ill usage is regarded not only as an insult to that particular person but as a rudeness to the whole company Respect for them ought to have restrained us from giving way to so boisterous and offensive an emotion It is the remote effects of these passions which are agreeable the immediate effects are mischief to the person against whom they are directed But it is the immediate and not the remote effects of objects which render them agreeable or disagreeable to the imagination A prison is certainly more useful to the publick than a palace and the person who founds the one is generally directed by a much juster spirit of patriotism than he who builds the other But the immediate effects of a prison the confinement of the wretches shut up in it are disagreeable and the imagination either does not take time to trace out the remote ones or sees them at too great a distance to be much affected by them A prison therefore will always be a disagreeable object and the fitter it is for the purpose for which  it was intended it will be the more so A palace on the contrary will always be agreeable yet its remote effects may often be inconvenient to the publick It may serve to promote luxury and set the example of the dissolution of manners Its immediate effects however the conveniency the pleasure and the gaiety of the people who live in it being all agreeable and suggesting to the imagination a thousand agreeable ideas that faculty generally rests upon them and seldom goes further in tracing its more distant consequences Trophies of the instruments of musick or of agriculture imitated in painting or in stucco make a common and an agreeable ornament of our halls and diningrooms A trophy of the same kind composed of the instruments of surgery of dissecting and amputationknives of saws for cutting the bones of trepanning instruments c would be absurd and shocking Instruments of surgery however are always more finely polished and generally more nicely adapted to the purposes for which they are intended than instruments of agriculture The remote effects of them too  the health of the patient is agreeable yet as the immediate effect of them is pain and suffering the sight of them always displeases us Instruments of war are agreeable tho' their immediate effect may seem to be in the same manner pain and suffering But then it is the pain and suffering of our enemies with whom we have no sympathy and with regard to us they are immediately connected with the agreeable ideas of courage victory and honour They are themselves therefore supposed to make one of the noblest parts of dress and the imitation of them one of the finest ornaments of architecture It is the same case with the qualities of the mind The antient stoics were of opinion that as the world was governed by the allruling providence of a wise powerful and good God every single event ought to be regarded as making a necessary part of the plan of the universe and as tending to promote the general order and happiness of the whole that the vices and follies of mankind therefore made as necessary a part of this plan as their wisdom or their virtue and by that eternal art which educes good  from ill were made to tend equally to the prosperity and perfection of the great system of nature No speculation of this kind however how deeply soever it might be rooted in the mind could diminish our natural abhorrence for vice whose immediate effects are so destructive and whose remote ones are too distant to be traced by the imagination  It is the same case with those passions we have been just now considering Their immediate effects are so disagreeable that even when they are most justly provoked there is still something about them which disgusts us These therefore are the only passions of which the expressions as I formerly observed do not dispose and prepare us to sympathize with them before we are informed of the cause which excites them The plaintive voice of misery when heard at a distance will not allow us to be indifferent about the person from whom it comes As soon as it strikes our ear it interests us in his fortune and if continued forces us almost involuntarily to fly to his assistance The sight of a smiling countenance in the same manner elevates even the pensive into that gay and airy  mood which disposes him to sympathize with and share the joy which it expresses and he feels his heart which with thought and care was before that shrunk and depressed instantly expanded and elated But it is quite otherwise with the expressions of hatred and resentment The hoarse boisterous and discordant voice of anger when heard at a distance inspires us either with fear or aversion We do not fly towards it as to one who cries out with pain and agony Women and men of weak nerves tremble and are overcome with fear tho' sensible that themselves are not the objects of the anger They conceive fear however by putting themselves in the situation of the person who is so Even those of stouter hearts are disturbed not indeed enough to make them afraid but enough to make them angry for anger is the passion which they would feel in the situation of the other person It is the same case with hatred Mere expressions of spite inspire it against no body but the man who uses them Both these passions are by nature the objects of our aversion Their disagreeable and boisterous appearance never excites  never prepares and often disturbs our sympathy Grief does not more powerfully engage and attract us to the person in whom we observe it than these while we are ignorant of their cause disgust and detach us from him It was it seems the intention of nature that those rougher and more unamiable emotions which drive men from one another should be less easily and more rarely communicated  When music imitates the modulations of grief or joy it either actually inspires us with those passions or at least puts us in the mood which disposes us to conceive them But when it imitates the notes of anger it inspires us with fear Joy grief love admiration devotion are all of them passions which are naturally musical Their natural tones are all soft clear and melodious and they naturally express themselves in periods which are distinguished by regular pauses and which upon that account are easily adapted to the regular returns of the correspondent airs of a tune The voice of anger on the contrary and of all the passions which are akin to it is harsh and discordant Its periods too are all irregular sometimes very long and  sometimes very short and distinguished by no regular pauses It is with difficulty therefore that music can imitate any of those passions and the music which does imitate them is not the most agreeable A whole entertainment may consist without any impropriety of the imitation of the social and agreeable passions It would be a strange entertainment which consisted altogether of the imitations of hatred and resentment  If those passions are disagreeable to the spectator they are not less so to the person who feels them Hatred and anger are the greatest poison to the happiness of a good mind There is in the very feeling of those passions something harsh jarring and convulsive something that tears and distracts the breast and is altogether destructive of that composure and tranquillity of mind which is so necessary to happiness and which is best promoted by the contrary passions of gratitude and love It is not the value of what they lose by the perfidy and ingratitude of those they live with which the generous and humane are most apt to regret Whatever they may have lost they can generally  be very happy without it What most disturbs them is the idea of perfidy and ingratitude exercised towards themselves and the discordant and disagreeable passions which this excites constitutes in their own opinion the chief part of the injury that they suffer  How many things are requisite to render the gratification of resentment compleatly agreeable and to make the spectator thoroughly sympathise with our revenge The provocation must first of all be such that we should become contemptible and be exposed to perpetual insults if we did not in some measure resent it Smaller offences are always better neglected nor is there any thing more despicable than that froward and captious humour which takes fire upon every slight occasion of quarrel We should resent more from a sense of the propriety of resentment from a sense that mankind expect and require it of us than because we feel in ourselves the furies of that disagreeable passion There is no passion of which the human mind is capable concerning whose justness we ought to be so doubtful concerning whose indulgence  we ought so carefully to consult our natural sense of propriety or so diligently to consider what will be the sentiments of the cool and impartial spectator Magnanimity or a regard to maintain our own rank and dignity in society is the only motive which can ennoble the expressions of this disagreeable passion This motive must characterize our whole stile and deportment These must be plain open and direct determined without positiveness and elevated without insolence not only free from petulance and low scurrility but generous candid and full of all proper regards even for the person who has offended us It must appear in short from our whole manner without our labouring affectedly to express it that passion has not extinguished our humanity and that if we yield to the dictates of revenge it is with reluctance from necessity and in consequence of great and repeated provocations When resentment is guarded and qualified in this manner it may be admitted to be even generous and noble  CHAP IV Of the social passions  AS it is a divided sympathy which renders this whole set of passions upon most occasions so ungraceful and disagreeable so there is another set opposite to these which a redoubled sympathy renders almost always peculiarly agreeable and becoming Generosity humanity kindness compassion mutual friendship and esteem all the social and benevolent affections when expressed in the countenance or behaviour even towards those who are peculiarly connected with ourselves please the indifferent spectator upon almost every occasion His sympathy with the person who feels those passions exactly coincides with his concern for the person who is the object of them The interest which as a man he is obliged to take in the happiness of this last enlivens his fellowfeeling with the sentiments of the other whose emotions are employed about the same object We have always therefore the strongest disposition  to sympathise with the benevolent affections They appear in every respect agreeable to us We enter into the satisfaction both of the person who feels them and of the person who is the object of them For as to be the object of hatred and indignation gives more pain than all the evil which a brave man can fear from his enemies so there is a satisfaction in the consciousness of being beloved which to a person of delicacy and sensibility is of more importance to happiness than all the advantage which he can expect to derive from it What character is so detestable as that of one who takes pleasure to sow dissention among friends and to turn their most tender love into mortal hatred Yet wherein does the atrocity of this so much  bhorred injury consist Is it in depriving them of the frivolous good offi  es which had their friendship continued  hey might have expected from one another It is in depriving them of that friend  hip itself in robbing them of each others  ffections from which both derived so much  atisfaction it is in disturbing the harmony of their hearts and putting an end  to that happy commerce which had before subsisted between them These affections that harmony this commerce are felt not only by the tender and the delicate but by the rudest vulgar of mankind to be of more importance to happiness than all the little services which could be expected to flow from them  The sentiment of love is in itself agreeable to the person who feels it it sooths and composes the breast seems to favour the vital motions and to promote the healthful state of the human constitution and it is rendered still more delightful by the consciousness of the gratitude and satisfaction which it must excite in him who is the object of it Their mutual regard renders them happy in one another and sympathy with this mutual regard makes them agreeable to every other person With what pleasure do we look upon a family through the whole of which reign mutual love and esteem in which the parents and children ar  companions for one another without an  other difference than what is made by respectful affection on the one side an  kind indulgence on the other whe  freedom and fondness mutual raillery and mutual kindness show that no opposition of interests divides the brothers nor any rivalship of favour sets the sisters at variance and where every thing presents us with the idea of peace chearfulness harmony and contentment On the contrary how uneasy are we made when we go into a house in which jarring contention sets one half of those who dwell in it against the other where amidst affected smoothness and complaisance suspicious looks and sudden starts of passion betray the mutual jealousies which burn within them and which are every moment ready to burst out through all the restraints which the presence of the company imposes  Those amiable passions even when they are acknowledged to be excessive are never regarded with aversion There is something agreeable even in the weakness of friendship and humanity The too tender mother the too indulgent father the too generous and affectionate friend may sometimes perhaps on account of the softness of their natures be looked upon with a species of pity in which  however there is a mixture of love but can never be regarded with hatred and aversion nor even with contempt unless by the most brutal and worthless of mankind It is always with concern with sympathy and kindness that we blame them for the extravagance of their attachment There is a helplessness in the character of extreme humanity which more than any thing interests our pity There is nothing in itself which renders it either ungraceful or disagreeable We only regret that it is unfit for the world because the world is unworthy of it and because it must expose the person who is endowed with it as a prey to the perfidy and ingratitude of insinuating falshood and to a thousand pains and uneasinesses which of all men he the least deserves to feel and which generally too he is of all men the least capable of supporting It is quite otherwise with hatred and resentment Too violent a propensity to those detestable passions renders a person the object of universal dread and abhorrence who like a wild beast ought we think to be hunted out of all civil society  CHAP V Of the selfish passions  BESIDES those two opposite sets of passions the social and unsocial there is another which holds a sort of middle place between them is never either so graceful as is sometimes the one set nor is ever so odious as is sometimes the other Grief and joy when conceived upon account of our own private good or bad fortune constitute this third set of passions Even when excessive they are never so disagreeable as excessive resentment because no opposite sympathy can ever interest us against them and when most suitable to their objects they are never so agreeable as impartial humanity and  ust benevolence because no double sympa  can ever interest us for them There  s however this difference between grief and joy that we are generally most disposed to sympathise with small joys and great sorrows The man who by some  udden revolution of fortune is lifted up  ll at once into a condition of life greatly  above what he had formerly lived in may be assured that the congratulations of his best friends are not all of them perfectly sincere An upstart though of the greatest merit is generally disagreeable and a sentiment of envy commonly prevents us from heartily sympathising with his joy If he has any judgment he is sensible of this and instead of appearing to be elated with his good fortune he endeavours as much as he can to smother his joy and keep down that elevation of mind with which his new circumstances naturally inspire him He affects the same plainness of dress and the same modesty of behaviour which became him in his former station He redoubles his attention to his old friends and endeavours more than ever to be humble assiduous and complaisant And this is the behaviour which in his situation we most approve of because we expect it seems that he should have more sympathy with our envy and aversion to his happiness than we have with his happiness It is seldom that with all this he succeeds We suspect the sincerity of his humility and he grows weary of this  constraint In a little time therefore he generally leaves all his old friends behind him some of the meanest of them excepted who may perhaps condescend to become his dependents nor does he always acquire any new ones the pride of his new connections is as much affronted at finding him their equal as that of his old ones had been by his becoming their superior and it requires the most obstinate and persevering modesty to attone for this mortification to either He generally grows weary too soon and is provoked by the sullen and suspicious pride of the one and by the saucy contempt of the other to treat the first with neglect and the second with pet  lance till at last he grows habitually insolent and forfeits the esteem of all If the chief part of human happiness arises from the consciousness of being beloved as I believe it does those sudden changes of fortune seldom contribute much to happiness He is happiest who advances more gradually to greatness whom the public destines to every step of his preferment long before he arrives at it in whom upon that account when it comes it  can excite no extravagant joy and with regard to whom it cannot reasonably create either any jealousy in those he overtakes or any envy in those he leaves behind  Mankind however more readily sympathise with those smaller joys which flow from less important causes It is decent to be humble amidst great prosperity but we can scarce express too much satisfaction in all the little occurrences of common life in the company with which we spent the evening last night in the entertainment that was set before us in what was said and what was done in all the little incidents of the present conversation and in all those frivolous nothings which fill up the void of human life Nothing is more graceful than habitual chearfulness which is always founded upon a peculiar relish for all the little pleasures which common occurrences afford We readily sympathise with it it inspires us with the same joy and makes every trifle turn up to us in the same agreeable aspect in which it presents itself to the person endowed with this happy disposition Hence it is that youth the season  of gaiety so easily engages our affections That propensity to joy which seems even to animate the bloom and to sparkle from the eyes of youth and beauty tho' in a person of the same sex exalts even the aged to a more joyous mood than ordinary They forget for a time their infirmities and abandon themselves to those agreeable ideas and emotions to which they have long been strangers but which when the presence of so much happiness recalls them to their breast take their place there like old acquaintance from whom they are sorry to have ever been parted and whom they embrace more heartily upon account of this long separation  It is quite otherwise with grief Small vexations excite no sympathy but deep affliction calls forth the greatest The man who is made uneasy by every little disagreeable incident who is hurt if either the cook or the butler have failed in the least article of their duty who feels every defect in the highest ceremonial of politeness whether it be shewn to himself or to any other person who takes it amiss that his intimate friend did not bid him  goodmorrow when they met in the forenoon and that his brother hummed a tune all the time he himself was telling a story who is put out of humour by the badness of the weather when in the country by the badness of the roads when upon a journey and by the want of company and dullness of all public diversions when in town such a person I say though he should have some reason will seldom meet with much sympathy Joy is a pleasant emotion and we gladly abandon ourselves to it upon the slightest occasion We readily therefore sympathise with it in others whenever we are not prejudiced by envy But grief is painful and the mind even when it is our own misfortune naturally resists and recoils from it We would endeavour either not to conceive it at all or to shake it off as soon as we have conceived it Our aversion to grief will not indeed always hinder us from conceiving it in our own case upon very trifling occasions but it constantly prevents us from sympathising with it in others when excited by the like frivolous causes for our sympathetic passions are always less irresistible than our  original ones There is besides a malice in mankind which not only prevents all sympathy with little uneasinesses but renders them in some measure diverting Hence the delight which we all take in raillery and in the small vexation which we observe in our companion when he is pushed and urged and teased upon all sides Men of the most ordinary good breeding dissemble the pain which any little incident may give them and those who are more thoroughly formed to society turn of their own accord all such incidents into raillery as they know their companions will do for them The habit which a man who lives in the world has acquired of considering how every thing that concerns himself will appear to others makes those frivolous calamities turn up in the same ridiculous light to him in which he knows they will certainly be considered by them  Our sympathy on the contrary with deep distress is very strong and very sincere It is unnecessary to give an instance We weep even at the feigned representation of a tragedy If you labour therefore under any signal calamity if  by some extraordinary misfortune you are fallen into poverty into diseases into disgrace and disappointment even though your own fault may have been in part the occasion yet you may generally depend upon the sincerest sympathy of all your friends and as far as interest and honour will permit upon their kindest assistance too But if your misfortune is not of this dreadful kind if you have only been a little baulked in your ambition if you have only been jilted by your mistress or only henpecked by your wife lay your account with the raillery of all your acquaintance  SECTION IV Of the effects of prosperity and adversity upon the judgment of mankind with regard to the propriety of action and why it is more easy to obtain their approbation in the one state than in the other  CHAP I That though our sympathy with sorrow is generally a more lively sensation than our sympathy with joy it commonly falls much more short of the violence of what is felt by the person principally concerned  OUR sympathy with sorrow though not more real has been more taken notice of than our sympathy with joy The word sympathy in its most proper and primitive signification denotes our fellowfeeling with the sufferings not that with the enjoyments of others A late ingenious and subtile philosopher thought it necessary to prove by arguments that  we had a real sympathy with joy and that congratulation was a principle of human nature No body I believe ever thought it necessary to prove that compassion was such  First of all our sympathy with sorrow is in some sense more universal than that with joy Though sorrow is excessive we may still have some fellowfeeling with it What we feel does not indeed in this case amount to that compleat sympathy to that perfect harmony and correspondence of sentiments which constitutes approbation We do not weep and exclaim and lament with the sufferer We are sensible on the contrary of his weakness and of the extravagance of his passion and yet often feel a very sensible concern upon his account But if we do not intirely enter into and go along with the joy of another we have no sort of regard or fellowfeeling for it The man who skips and dances about with that intemperate and senseless joy which we cannot accompany him in is the object of our contempt and indignation  Pain besides whether of mind or body is a more pungent sensation than pleasure and our sympathy with pain though it falls greatly short of what is naturally felt by the sufferer is generally a more lively and distinct perception than our sympathy with pleasure though this last often approaches more nearly as I shall show immediately to the natural vivacity of the original passion  Over and above all this we often struggle to keep down our sympathy with the sorrow of others Whenever we are not under the observation of the sufferer we endeavour for our own sake to suppress it as much as we can and we are not always successful The opposition which we make to it and the reluctance with which we yield to it necessarily oblige us to take more particular notice of it But we never have occasion to make this opposition to our sympathy with joy If there is any envy in the case we never feel the least propensity towards it and if there is none we give way to it without any reluctance On the contrary as we are always ashamed of our own envy we often pretend and sometimes really  wish to sympathise with the joy of others when by that disagreeable sentiment we are disqualified from doing so We are glad we say upon account of our neighbour's good fortune when in our hearts perhaps we are really sorry We often feel a sympathy with sorrow when we would wish to be rid of it and we often miss that with joy when we would be glad to have it The obvious observation therefore which it naturally falls in our way to make is that our propensity to sympathise with sorrow must be very strong and our inclination to sympathise with joy very weak  Notwithstanding this prejudice however I will venture to affirm that when there is no envy in the case our propensity to sympathise with joy is much stronger than our propensity to sympathise with sorrow and that our fellowfeeling for the agreeable emotion approaches much more nearly to the vivacity of what is naturally felt by the persons principally concerned than that which we conceive for the painful one  We have some indulgence for that excessive grief which we cannot entirely go  along with We know what a prodigious effort is requisite before the sufferer can bring down his emotions to compleat harmony and concord with those of the spectator Though he fails therefore we easily pardon him But we have no such indulgence for the intemperance of joy because we are not conscious that any such vast effort is requisite to bring it down to what we can intirely enter into The man who under the greatest calamities can command his sorrow seems worthy of the highest admiration but he who in the fulness of prosperity can in the same manner master his joy seems hardly to deserve any praise We are sensible that there is a much wider interval in the one case than in the other between what is naturally felt by the person principally concerned and what the spectator can intirely go along with  What can be added to the happiness of the man who is in health who is out of debt and has a clear conscience To one in this situation all accessions of fortune may properly be said to be superfluous and if he is much elevated upon account of them it must be the effect of  the most frivolous levity This situation however may very well be called the natural and ordinary state of mankind Notwithstanding the present misery and depravity of the world so justly lamented this really is the state of the greater part of men The greater part of men therefore cannot find any great difficulty in elevating themselves to all the joy which any accession to this situation can well excite in their companion  But though little can be added to this state much may be taken from it Tho' between this condition and the highest pitch of human prosperity the interval is but a trifle between it and the lowest depth of misery the distance is immense and prodigious Adversity upon this account necessarily depresses the mind of the sufferer much more below its natural state than prosperity can elevate him above it The spectator therefore must find it much more difficult to sympathise entirely and keep perfect time with his sorrow than thoroughly to enter into his joy and must depart much further from his own natural and ordinary temper of mind in the one case than in the other It is upon this account that though our sympathy  with sorrow is often a more pungent sensation than our sympathy with joy it always falls much more short of the violence of what is naturally felt by the person principally concerned  It is agreeable to sympathise with joy and wherever envy does not oppose it our heart abandons itself with satisfaction to the highest transports of that delightful sentiment But it is painful to go along with grief and we always enter into it with reluctance When we attend to the representation of a tragedy we struggle against that sympathetic sorrow which the entertainment inspires as long as we can and we give way to it at last only when we can no longer avoid it we even then endeavour to cover our concern from the company If we shed any tears we carefully conceal them and are afraid lest the spectators not entering into this excessive tenderness should regard it as effeminacy and weakness The wretch whose misfortunes call upon our compassion feels with what reluctance we are likely to enter into his sorrow and therefore proposes his grief to us with fear and hesitation he even smothers the half of it and is ashamed  upon account of this hardheartedness of mankind to give vent to the fulness of his affliction It is otherwise with the man who riots in joy and success Wherever envy does not interest us against him he expects our compleatest sympathy He does not fear therefore to enounce himself with shouts of exultation in full confidence that we are heartily disposed to go along with him  Why should we be more ashamed to weep than to laugh before company We may often have as real occasion to do the one as to do the other but we always feel that the spectators are more likely to go along with us in the agreeable than in the painful emotion It is always miserable to complain even when we are oppressed by the most dreadful calamities But the triumph of victory is not always ungraceful Prudence indeed would often advise us to bear our prosperity with more moderation because prudence would teach us to avoid that envy which this very triumph is more than any thing apt to excite  How hearty are the acclamations of the mob who never bear any envy to their superiors at a triumph or a public entry  And how sedate and moderate is commonly their grief at an execution Our sorrow at a funeral generally amounts to no more than an affected gravity but our mirth at a christening or a marriage is always from the heart and without any affectation Upon these and all such joyous occasions our satisfaction though not so durable is often as lively as that of the persons principally concerned Whenever we cordially congratulate our friends which however to the disgrace of human nature we do but seldom their joy literally becomes our joy we are for the moment as happy as they are our heart swells and overflows with real pleasure joy and complacency sparkle from our eyes and animate every feature of our countenance and every gesture of our body  But on the contrary when we condole with our friends in their afflictions how little do we feel in comparison of what they feel We sit down by them we look at them and while they relate to us the circumstances of their misfortune we listen to them with gravity and attention But while their narration is every moment interrupted by those natural bursts of passion  which often seem almost to choak them in the midst of it how far are the languid emotions of our hearts from keeping time to the transports of theirs We may be sensible at the same time that their passion is natural and no greater than what we ourselves might feel upon the like occasion We may even inwardly reproach ourselves with our own want of sensibility and perhaps upon that account work ourselves up into an artificial sympathy which however when it is raised is always the slightest and most transitory imaginable and generally as soon as we have left the room vanishes and is gone forever Nature it seems when she loaded us with our own sorrows thought that they were enough and therefore did not command us to take any further share in those of others than what was necessary to prompt us to relieve them  It is upon account of this dull sensibility to the afflictions of others that magnanimity amidst great distress appears always so divinely graceful His behaviour is genteel and agreeable who can maintain his chearfulness amidst a number of frivolous disasters But he appears to be more  than mortal who can support in the same manner the most dreadful calamities We feel what an immense effort is requisite to silence those violent emotions which naturally agitate and distract those in his situation We are amazed to find that he can command himself so intirely His firmness at the same time perfectly coincides with our insensibility He makes no demand upon us for that more exquisite degree of sensibility which we find and which we are mortified to find that we do not possess There is the most perfect correspondence between his sentiments and ours and upon that account the most perfect propriety in his behaviour It is a propriety too which from our experience of the usual weakness of human nature we could not reasonably have expected he should be able to maintain We wonder with surprise and astonishment at that strength of mind which is capable of so noble and generous an effort The sentiment of compleat sympathy and approbation mixed and animated with wonder and surprise constitutes what is properly called admiration as has already been more than once taken notice of Cato surrounded on all sides  by his enemies unable to resist them disdaining to submit to them and reduced by the proud maxims of that age to the necessity of destroying himself yet never shrinking from his misfortunes never supplicating with the lamentable voice of wretchedness those miserable sympathetic tears which we are always so unwilling to give but on the contrary arming himself with manly fortitude and the moment before he executes his fatal resolution giving with his usual tranquillity all necessary orders for the safety of his friends appears to Seneca that great preacher of insensibility a spectacle which even the gods themselves might behold with pleasure and admiration  Whenever we meet in common life with any examples of such heroic magnanimity we are always extremely affected We are more apt to weep and shed tears for such as in this manner seem to feel nothing for themselves than for those who give way to all the weakness of sorrow and in this particular case the sympathetic grief of the spectator appears to go beyond the original passion in the person principally concerned The friends of Socrates all wept when he drank the last  potion while he himself expressed the gaiest and most chearful tranquillity Upon all such occasions the spectator makes no effort and has no occasion to make any in order to conquer his sympathetic sorrow He is under no fear that it will transport him to any thing that is extravagant and improper he is rather pleased with the sensibility of his own heart and gives way to it with complacence and selfapprobation He gladly indulges therefore the most melancholy views which can naturally occur to him concerning the calamity of his friend for whom perhaps he never felt so exquisitely before the tender and tearful passion of love But it is quite otherwise with the person principally concerned He is obliged as much as possible to turn away his eyes from whatever is either naturally terrible or disagreeable in his situation Too serious an attention to those circumstances he fears might make so violent an impression upon him that he could no longer keep within the bounds of moderation or render himself the object of the compleat sympathy and approbation of the spectators He fixes his thoughts therefore upon those only which are agreeable  the applause and admiration which he is about to deserve by the heroic magnanimity of his behaviour To feel that he is capable of so noble and generous an effort to feel that in this dreadful situation he can still act as he would desire to act animates and transports him with joy and enables him to support that triumphant gaiety which seems to exult in the victory that he thus gains over his misfortunes  On the contrary he always appears in some measure mean and despicable who is sunk in sorrow and dejection upon account of any calamity of his own We cannot bring ourselves to feel for him what he feels for himself and what perhaps we should feel for ourselves if in his situation we therefore despise him unjustly perhaps if any sentiment could be regarded as unjust to which we are by nature irresistibly determined The weakness of sorrow never appears in any respect agreeable except when it arises from what we feel for others more than from what we feel for ourselves A son upon the death of an indulgent and respectable father may give way to it without much blame His sorrow  is chiefly founded upon a sort of sympathy with his departed parent and we readily enter into this humane emotion But if he should indulge the same weakness upon account of any misfortune which affected himself only he would no longer meet with any such indulgence If he should be reduced to beggary and ruin if he should be exposed to the most dreadful dangers if he should even be led out to a public execution and there shed one single tear upon the scaffold he would disgrace himself forever in the opinion of all the gallant and generous part of mankind Their compassion for him however would be very strong and very sincere but as it would still fall short of this excessive weakness they would have no pardon for the man who could thus expose himself in the eyes of the world His behaviour would affect them with shame rather than with sorrow and the dishonour which he had thus brought upon himself would appear to them the most lamentable circumstance in his misfortune How did it disgrace the memory of the intrepid Duke of Byron who had so often braved death in the field that he wept upon the scaffold when he beheld the state to which he  was fallen and remembered the favour and the glory from which his own rashness had so unfortunately thrown him  CHAP II Of the origin of ambition and of the distinction of ranks  IT is because mankind are disposed to sympathise more entirely with our joy than with our sorrow that we make parade of our riches and conceal our poverty Nothing is so mortifying as to be obliged to expose our distress to the view of the public and to feel that though our situation is open to the eyes of all mankind no mortal conceives for us the half of what we suffer Nay it is chiefly from this regard to the sentiments of mankind that we pursue riches and avoid poverty For to what purpose is all the toil and bustle of this world what is the end of avarice and ambition of the pursuit of wealth of power and preheminence Is it to supply the necessities of nature The wages of the meanest labourer can supply them We see that they afford him food and cloathing  the comfort of a house and of a family If we examine his oeconomy with rigor we shall find that he spends a great part of them upon conveniencies which may be regarded as superfluities and that upon extraordinary occasions he can give something even to vanity and distinction What then is the cause of our aversion to his situation and why should those who have been educated in the highest ranks of life regard it as worse than death to be reduced to live even without labour upon the same simple fare with him to dwell under the same lowly roof and to be cloathed in the same humble attire Do they imagine that their stomach is better or their sleep sounder in a palace than in a cottage The contrary has been so often observed and indeed is so very obvious though it had never been observed that there is nobody ignorant of it From whence then arises that emulation which runs through all the different ranks of men and what are the advantages which we propose by that great purpose of human life which we call bettering our condition To be observed to be attended to to be taken notice of with sympathy complacency and approbation  are all the advantages which we can propose to derive from it It is the vanity not the ease or the pleasure which interests us But vanity is always founded upon the belief of our being the object of attention and approbation The rich man glories in his riches because he feels that they naturally draw upon him the attention of the world and that mankind are disposed to go along with him in all those agreeable emotions with which the advantages of his situation so readily inspire him At the thought of this his heart seems to swell and dilate itself within him and he is fonder of his wealth upon this account than for all the other advantages it procures him The poor man on the contrary is ashamed of his poverty He feels that it either places him out of the sight of mankind or that if they take any notice of him they have however scarce any fellowfeeling with the misery and distress which he suffers He is mortified upon both accounts for though to be overlooked and to be disapproved of are things entirely different yet as obscurity covers us from the daylight of honour and approbation to feel that we are taken no  notice of necessarily damps the most agreeable hope and disappoints the most ardent desire of human nature The poor man goes out and comes in unheeded and when in the midst of a croud is in the same obscurity as if shut up in his own hovel Those humble cares and painful attentions which occupy those in his situation afford no amusement to the dissipated and the gay They turn away their eyes from him or if the extremity of his distress forces them to look at him it is only to spurn so disagreeable an object from among them The fortunate and the proud wonder at the insolence of human wretchedness that it should dare to present itself before them and with the loathsome aspect of its misery presume to disturb the serenity of their happiness The man of rank and distinction on the contrary is observed by all the world Every body is eager to look at him and to conceive at least by sympathy that joy and exultation with which his circumstances naturally inspire him His actions are the objects of the public care Scarce a word scarce a gesture can fall from him that is altogether neglected In a great assembly he is the person upon whom all  direct their eyes it is upon him that their passions seem all to wait with expectation in order to receive that movement and direction which he shall impress upon them and if his behaviour is not altogether absurd he has every moment an opportunity of interesting mankind and of rendering himself the object of the observation and fellowfeeling of every body about him It is this which notwithstanding the restraint it imposes notwithstanding the loss of liberty with which it is attended renders greatness the object of envy and compensates in the opinion of mankind all that toil all that anxiety all those mortifications which must be undergone in the pursuit of it and what is of yet more consequence all that leisure all that ease all that careless security which are forfeited forever by the acquisition  When we consider the condition of the great in those delusive colours in which the imagination is apt to paint it it seems to be almost the abstract idea of a perfect and happy state It is the very state which in all our waking dreams and idle reveries we had sketched out to ourselves as the final object of all our desires We  feel therefore a peculiar sympathy with the satisfaction of these who are in it We favour all their inclinations and forward all their wishes What pity we think that any thing should spoil and corrupt  o agreeable a situation We could even wish them immortal and it seems hard to  s that death should at last put an end  o such perfect enjoyment It is cruel we  hink in nature to compel them from  heir exalted stations to that humble but hospitable home which she has provided for all her children Great King live for ever is the compliment which after the manner of eastern adulation we should  eadily make them if experience did not  each us its absurdity Every calamity  hat befals them every injury that is done  hem excites in the breast of the spectator  en times more compassion and resentment  han he would have felt had the same  hings happened to other men It is the misfortunes of Kings only which afford  he proper subjects for tragedy They re  emble in this respect the misfortunes of  overs Those two situations are the chief which interest us upon the theatre because in spite of all that reason and experience  can tell us to the contrary the prejudices of the imagination attach to these two states a happiness superior to any other To disturb or to put an end to such perfect enjoyment seems to be the most atrocious of all injuries The traitor who conspires against the life of his monarch is thought a greater monster than any other murderer All the innocent blood that was shed in the civil wars provoked less indignation than the death of Charles I A stranger to human nature who saw the indifference of men about the misery of their inferiors and the regret and indignation which they feel for the misfortunes and sufferings of those above them would be apt to imagine that pain must be more agonizing and the convulsions of death more terrible to persons of high rank than to those of meaner stations  Upon this disposition of mankind to go along with all the passions of the rich and the powerful is founded the distinction of ranks and the order of society Our obsequiousness to our superiors more frequently arises from our admiration for the advantages of their situation than from  any private expectations of benefits from their goodwill Their benefits can extend but to a few but their fortunes interest almost every body We are eager to assist them in compleating a system of happiness that approaches so near to perfection and we desire to serve them for their own sake without any other recompence but the vanity or the honour of obliging them Neither is our deference to their inclinations founded chiefly or altogether upon a regard to the utility of such submission and to the order of society which is best supported by it Even when the order of society seems to require that we should oppose them we can hardly bring ourselves to do it That kings are the servants of the people to be obeyed resisted deposed or punished as the public conveniency may require is the doctrine of reason and philosophy but it is not the doctrine of nature Nature would teach us to submit to them for their own sake to tremble and bow down before their exalted station to regard their smile as a reward sufficient to compensate any services and to dread their displeasure though no other evil was to follow from it as the severest of all  mortifications To treat them in any respect as men to reason and dispute with them upon ordinary occasions requires such resolution that there are few men whose magnanimity can support them in it unless they are likewise assisted by familiarity and acquaintance The strongest motives the most furious passions fear hatred and resentment are scarce sufficient to balance this natural disposition to respect them and their conduct must either justly or unjustly have excited the highest degree of all those passions before the bulk of the people can be brought to oppose them with violence or to desire to see them either punished or deposed Even when the people have been brought this length they are apt to relent every moment and easily relapse into their habitual state of deference to those whom they have been accustomed to look upon as their natural superiors They cannot stand the mortification of their monarch Compassion soon takes the place of resentment they forget all past provocations their old principles of loyalty revive and they ru  to reestablish the ruined authority of thei  old masters with the same violence wit  which they had opposed it The death of Charles I brought about the Restoration of the royal family Compassion for James II when he was seized by the populace in making his escape on shipboard had almost prevented the revolution and made it go on more heavily than before  Do the great seem insensible of the easy price at which they may acquire the public admiration or do they seem to imagine that to them as to other men it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood By what important accomplishments is the young nobleman instructed to support the dignity of his rank and to render himself worthy of that superiority over his fellow citizens to which the virtue of his ancestors had raised them Is it by knowledge by industry by patience by selfdenial or by virtue of any kind As all his words as all his motions are attended  o he learns an habitual regard to every circumstance of ordinary behaviour and studies to perform all those small duties with the most exact propriety As he is conscious how much he is observed and how much mankind are disposed to favour all his inclinations he acts upon the most  indifferent occasions with that freedom and elevation which the thought of this naturally inspires His air his manner his deportment all mark that elegant and graceful sense of his own superiority which those who are born to inferior stations can hardly ever arrive at these are the arts by which he proposes to make mankind more easily submit to his authority and to govern their inclinations according to his own pleasure and in this he is seldom disappointed These arts supported by rank and preheminence are upon ordinary occasions sufficient to govern the world Lewis XIV during the greater part of his reign was regarded not only in France but over all Europe as the most perfect model of a great prince But what were the talents and virtues by which he acquired this great reputation Was it by the scrupulous and inflexible justice of all his undertakings by the immense dangers and difficulties with which they were attended or by the unwearied and unrelenting application with which he pursued them Was it by his extensive knowledge by his exquisite judgment or by his heroic valour It was by none of these qualities  But he was first of all the most powerful prince in Europe and consequently held the highest rank among kings and then says his historian  he surpassed all his courtiers in the gracefulness of his shape and the majestic beauty of his features The sound of his voice noble and affecting gained those hearts which his presence intimidated He had a step and a deportment which could suit only him and his rank and which would have been ridiculous in any other person The embarassment which he occasioned to those who spoke to him flattered that secret satisfaction with which he felt his own superiority The old officer who was confounded and faultered in asking him a favour and not being able to conclude his discourse said to him Sir your majesty I hope will believe that I do not tremble thus before your enemies had no difficulty to obtain what he demanded  These frivolous accomplishments supported by his rank and no doubt too by a degree of other talents and virtues which seems however not to have been much above mediocrity established this prince in the esteem of his own age and have drawn  even from posterity a good deal of respect for his memory Compared with these in his own times and in his own presence no other virtue it seems appeared to have any merit Knowledge industry valour and beneficence trembled were abashed and lost all dignity before them  But it is not by accomplishments of this kind that the man of inferior rank must hope to distinguish himself Politeness is so much the virtue of the great that it will do little honour to any body but themselves The coxcomb who imitates their manner and affects to be eminent by the superior propriety of his ordinary behaviour is rewarded with a double share of contempt for his folly and presumption Why should the man whom nobody thinks it worth while to look at be very anxious about the manner in which he holds up his head or disposes of his arms while he walks through a room He is occupied surely with a very superfluous attention and with an attention too that marks a sense of his own importance which no other mortal can go along with The most perfect modesty and plainness joined to as  much negligence as is consistent with the respect due to the company ought to be the chief characteristics of the behaviour of a private man If ever he hopes to distinguish himself it must be by more important virtues He must acquire dependants to balance the dependants of the great and he has no other fund to pay them from but the labour of his body and the activity of his mind He must cultivate these therefore he must acquire superior knowledge in his profession and superior industry in the exercise of it He must be patient in labour resolute in danger and firm in distress These talents he must bring into publick view by the difficulty importance and at the same time good judgment of his undertakings and by the severe and unrelenting application with which he pursues them Probity and prudence generosity and frankness must characterise his behaviour upon all ordinary occasions and he must at the same time be forward to engage in all those situations in which it requires the greatest talents and virtues to act with propriety but in which the greatest applause is to be acquired by those who can  acquit themselves with honour With what impatience does the man of spirit and ambition who is depressed by his situation look round for some great opportunity to distinguish himself No circumstances which can afford this appear to him undesireable He even looks forward with satisfaction to the prospect of foreign war or civil dissension and with secret transport and delight sees through all the confusion and bloodshed which attend them the probability of those wished for occasions presenting themselves in which he may draw upon himself the attention and admiration of mankind The man of rank and distinction on the contrary whose whole glory consists in the propriety of his ordinary behaviour who is contented with the humble renown which this can afford him and has no talents to acquire any other is unwilling to embarass himself with what can be attended either with difficulty or distress To figure at a ball is his great triumph and to succeed in an intrigue of gallantry his highest exploit He has an aversion to all publick confusions not from the love of mankind for the great never look upon their inferiors  as their fellowcreatures nor yet from want of courage for in that he is seldom defective but from a consciousness that he possesses none of the virtues which are required in such situations and that the publick attention will certainly be drawn away from him by others He may be willing to expose himself to some little danger and to make a campaign when it happens to be the fashion But he shudders with horror at the thought of any situation which demands the continual and long exertion of patience industry fortitude and application of thought These virtues are hardly ever to be met with in men who are born to those high stations In all governments accordingly even in monarchies the highest offices are generally possessed and the whole detail of the administration conducted by men who were educated in the middle and inferior ranks of life who have been carried forward by their own industry and abilities tho'  oaded with the jealousy and opposed by the resentment of all those who were born their superiors and to whom the great after having regarded them first with contempt and afterwards with envy are at  last contented to truckle with the same abject meanness with which they desire that the rest of mankind should behave to themselves  It is the loss of this easy empire over the affections of mankind which renders the fall from greatness so insupportable When the family of the King of Macedon was led in triumph by Paulus Aemilius their misfortunes it is said made them divide with their conqueror the attention of the Roman people The sight of the royal children whose tender age rendered them insensible of their situation struck the spectators amidst the public rejoicings and prosperity with the tenderest sorrow and compassion The King appeared next in the procession and seemed like one confounded and astonished and bereft of all sentiment by the greatness of his calamities His friends and ministers followed after him As they moved along they often cast their eyes upon their fallen sovereign and always burst into tears at the sight their whole behaviour demonstrating that they thought not of their own misfortunes but were occupied intirely by the superior greatness of his The generous  Romans on the contrary beheld him with disdain and indignation and regarded as unworthy of all compassion the man who could be so meanspirited as to bear to live under such calamities Yet what did those calamities amount to According to the greater part of historians he was to spend the remainder of his days under the protection of a powerful and humane people in a state which in itself should seem worthy of envy a state of plenty ease leisure and security from which it was impossible for him even by his own folly to fall But he was no longer to be surrounded by that admiring mob of fools flatterers and dependants who had formerly been accustomed to attend upon all his motions He was no longer to be gazed upon by multitudes nor to have it in his power to render himself the object of their respect their gratitude their love their admiration The passions of nations were no longer to mould themselves upon his inclinations This was that insupportable calamity which bereaved the King of all sentiment which made his friends forget their own misfortunes and which the Roman magnanimity  could scarce conceive how any man could be so meanspirited as to bear to survive  Love says my Lord Rochefaucault is commonly succeeded by ambition but ambition is hardly ever succeeded by love  That passion when once it has got intire possession of the breast will admit neither a rival nor a successor To those who have been accustomed to the possession or even to the hope of public admiration all other pleasures sicken and decay Of all the discarded statesmen who for their own ease have studied to get the better of ambition and to despise those honours which they could no longer arrive at how few have been able to succeed▪ The greater part have spent their time in the most listless and insipid indolence chagrined at the thoughts of their own insignificancy incapable of being interested in the occupations of private life without enjoyment except when they talked of their former greatness and without satisfaction except when they were employed in some vain project to recover it Are you in earnest resolved never to barter your liberty for the lordly servitude of a Court but  to live free fearless and independant There seems to be one way to continue in that virtuous resolution and perhaps but one Never enter the place from whence so few have been able to return never come within the circle of ambition nor ever bring yourself into comparison with those masters of the earth who have already engrossed the attention of half mankind before you  Of such mighty importance does it appear to be in the imaginations of men to stand in that situation which sets them most in the view of general sympathy and attention And thus place that great object which divides the wives of aldermen is the end of half the labours of human life and is the cause of all the tumult and bustle all the rapine and injustice which avarice and ambition have introduced into this world People of sense it is said indeed despise place that is they despise sitting at the head of the table and are indifferent who it is that is pointed out to the company by that frivolous circumstance which the smallest advantage is capable of overbalancing But rank distinction preeminence no man despises unless  he is either raised very much above or sunk very much below the ordinary standard of human nature unless he is either so confirmed in wisdom and real philosophy as to be satisfied that while the propriety of his conduct renders him the just object of approbation it is of little consequence tho' he be neither attended to nor approved of or so habituated to the idea of his own meanness so sunk in slothful and sottish indifference as intirely to have forgot the desire and almost the very wish for superiority  CHAP III Of the stoical philosophy  WHEN we examine in this manner into the ground of the different degrees of estimation which mankind are apt to bestow upon the different conditions of life we shall find that the excessive preference which they generally give to some of them above others is in a great measure without any foundation If to be able to act with propriety and to render ourselves the proper objects of the approbation  of mankind be as we have been endeavouring to show what chiefly recommends to us one condition above another this may be equally attained in them all The noblest propriety of conduct may be supported in adversity as well as in prosperity and tho' it is somewhat more difficult in the first it is upon that very account more admirable Perils and misfortunes are not only the proper school of heroism they are the only proper theatre which can exhibit its virtue to advantage and draw upon it the full applause of the world The man whose whole life has been one even and uninterrupted course of prosperity who never braved any danger who never encountered any difficulty who never surmounted any distress can excite but an inferior degree of admiration When poets and romancewriters endeavour to invent a train of adventures which shall give the greatest lustre to those characters for whom they mean to interest  s they are all of a different kind They  re rapid and sudden changes of fortune  ituations the most apt to drive those who  re in them to frenzy and distraction or  o abject despair but in which their heroes  act with so much propriety or at least with so much spirit and undaunted resolution as still to command our esteem Is not the unfortunate magnanimity of Cato Brutus and Leonidas as much the object of admiration as that of the successful Caesar or Alexander To a generous mind therefore ought it not to be as much the object of envy If a more dazzling splendor seems to attend the fortunes of successful conquerors it is because they join together the advantages of both situations the lustre of prosperity to the high admiration which is excited by dangers encountered and difficulties surmounted with intrepidity and valour  It was upon this account that according to the stoical philosophy to a wise man all the different conditions of life were equal Nature they said had recommended some objects to our choice and others to our disapprobation Our primary appetites directed us to the pursuit of health strength ease and perfection in all the qualities of mind and body▪ and of whatever could promote or secure these riches power authority and the same original principle taught us to avoid  the contrary But in chusing or rejecting in preferring or postponing those first objects of original appetite and aversion nature had likewise taught us that there was a certain order propriety and grace to be observed of infinitely greater consequence to happiness and perfection than the attainment of those objects themselves The objects of our primary appetites or aversions were to be pursued or avoided chiefly because a regard to this grace and propriety required such conduct In directing all our actions according to these consisted the happiness and glory of human nature In departing from those rules which they prescribed to us its greatest wretchedness and most compleat depravity The outward appearance of this order and propriety was indeed more easily maintained in some circumstances than in others To a fool however to one whose passions were subjected to no proper controul to act with real grace and propriety was equally impossible in every situation Tho' the giddy multitude might admire him tho' his vanity might sometimes be elated by their ignorant praises into something that resembled selfapprobation  yet still when he turned his view to what passed within his own breast he was secretly conscious to himself of the absurdity and meanness of all his motives and inwardly blushed and trembled at the thoughts of the contempt which he knew he deserved and which mankind would certainly bestow upon him if they saw his conduct in the light in which in his own heart he was obliged to regard it To a wise man on the contrary to one whose passions were all brought under perfect subjection to the ruling principles of his nature to reason and the love of propriety to act so as to deserve approbation was equally easy upon all occasions Was he in prosperity he returned thanks to Jupiter for having joined him with circumstances which were easily mastered and in which there was little temptation to do wrong Was he in adversity he equally returned thanks to the director of this spectacle of human life for having opposed to him a vigorous athlete over whom tho' the contest was likely to be more violent the victory was more glorious and equally certain Can there be any shame in that distress which is brought upon us  without any fault of our own and in which we behave with perfect propriety There can therefore be no evil but on the contrary the greatest good and advantage A brave man exults in those dangers in which from no rashness of his own his fortune has involved him They afford an opportunity of exercising that heroic intrepidity whose exertion gives the exalted delight which flows from the consciousness of superior propriety and deserved admiration One who is master of all his exercises has no aversion to measure his strength and activity with the strongest And in the same manner one who is master of all his passions does not dread any circumstance in which the superintendent of the universe may think proper to place him The bounty of that divine being has provided him with vir  ues which render him superior to every  ituation If it is pleasure he has temperance to refrain from it if it is pain he has constancy to bear it if it is danger or death he has magnanimity and fortitude  o despise it He never complains of the destiny of providence nor thinks the universe in confusion when he is out of order  He does not look upon himself according to what selflove would suggest as a whole separated and detached from every other part of nature to be taken care of by itself and for itself He regards himself in the light in which he imagines the great Genius of human nature and of the world regards him He enters if I may say so into the sentiments of that Divine Being and considers himself as an atom a particle of an immense and infinite system which must and ought to be disposed of according to the conveniency of the whole Assured of the wisdom which directs all the events of human life whatever lot befalls him he accepts it with joy satisfied that if he had known all the connexions and dependencies of the different parts of the universe it is the very lot which he himself would have wished for If it is life he is contented to live and if it is death as nature must have no further occasion for his presence here he willingly goes where he is appointed I accept said a stoical philosopher with equal joy and satisfaction whatever fortune can befal me Riches or poverty pleasure or pain health or sickness all is alike nor would I  desire that the Gods should in any respect change my destination If I was to ask of them any thing beyond what their bounty has already bestowed it would be that they would inform me beforehand what it was their pleasure should be done with me that I might of my own accord place myself in this situation and demonstrate the chearfulness with which I embraced their allotment If I am going to sail says Epictetus I chuse the best ship and the best pilot and I wait for the fairest weather that my circumstances and duty will allow Prudence and propriety the principles which the Gods have given me for the direction of my conduct require this of me but they require no more and if notwithstanding a storm arises which neither the strength of the vessel nor the skill of the pilot are likely to withstand I give myself no trouble about the consequence All that I had to do is done already The directors of my conduct never command me to be miserable to be anxious desponding or afraid Whether we are to be drowned or to come to a harbour is the business of Jupiter not mine I leave it intirely to his determination nor ever  break my rest with considering which way he is likely to decide it but receive whatever comes with equal indifference and security  Such was the philosophy of the stoics A philosophy which affords the noblest lessons of magnanimity is the best school of heroes and patriots and to the greater part of whose precepts there can be no other objection except that honourable one that they teach us to aim at a perfection altogether beyond the reach of human nature I shall not at present stop to examine it I shall only observe in confirmation of what has formerly been said that the most dreadful calamities are not always those which it is most difficult to support It is often more mortifying to appear in publick under small disasters than under great misfortunes The first excite no sympathy but the second tho' they may excite none that approaches to the anguish of the sufferer call forth however a very lively compassion The sentiments of the spectators are in this last case therefore less wide of those of the sufferer and their imperfect fellowfeeling  lends him some assistance in supporting his misery Before a gay assembly a gentleman would be more mortified to appear covered with filth and rags than with blood and wounds This last situation would interest their pity the other would provoke their laughter The judge who orders a criminal to be set in the pillory dishonours him more than if he had condemned him to the scaffold The great prince who some years ago caned a general officer at the head of his army disgraced him irrecoverably The punishment would have been much less had he shot him through the body By the laws of honour to strike with a cane dishonours to strike with a sword does not for an obvious reason Those slighter punishments when inflicted on a gentleman to whom dishonour is the greatest of all evils come to be regarded among a humane and generous people as the most dreadful of any With regard to persons of that rank therefore they are univer  ally laid aside and the law while it takes  heir life upon many occasions respects  heir honour upon almost all To scourge  a person of quality or to set him in the pillory upon account of any crime whatever is a brutality of which no European government except that of Russia is capable  A brave man is not rendered contemptible by being brought to the scaffold he is by being set in the pillory His behaviour in the one situation may gain him universal esteem and admiration No behaviour in the other can render him agreeable The sympathy of the spectators supports him in the one case and saves him from that shame that consciousness that his misery is felt by himself only which is of all sentiments the most unsupportable There is no sympathy in the other or if There is any it is not with his pain which is a trifle but with his consciousness of the want of sympathy with which this pain is attended It is with his shame not with his sorrow Those who pity him blush and hang down their heads for him He droops in the same manner and feels himself irrecoverably degraded by the punishment though not by the crime The man on the contrary who dies with resolution  as he is naturally regarded with erect aspect of esteem and approbation so he wears himself the same undaunted countenance and if the crime does not deprive him of the respect of others the punishment never will He has no suspicion that his situation is the object of contempt or derision to any body and he can with propriety assume the air not only of perfect serenity but of triumph and exultation  Great dangers says the cardinal de Retz have their charms because there is some glory to be got even when we miscarry But moderate dangers have nothing but what is horrible because the loss of reputation always attends the want of success  His maxim has the same foundation with what we have been observing just now with regard to punishments  Human virtue is superior to pain to poverty to danger and to death nor does it even require its remotest efforts to despise them But to have its misery exposed to insult and derision to be led in triumph to be set up for the hand of scorn  to point at is a situation in which its constancy is much more apt to fail Compared with the contempt of mankind all other evils are easily supported  PART II Of MERIT and DEMERIT or of the Objects of REWARD and PUNISHMENT  SECTION I Of the sense of merit and demerit  INTRODUCTION  THERE is another set of qualities ascribed to the actions and conduct of mankind distinct from their propriety or impropriety their decency or ungracefulness and which are the objects of a distinct species of approbation and disapprobation These are merit and demerit the qualities of deserving reward and of deserving punishment  It has already been observed that the  entiment or affection of the heart from which any action proceeds and upon which  ts whole virtue or vice depends may be  considered under two different aspects or in two different relations First in relation to the cause or object which excites it and secondly in relation to the end which it proposes or to the effect which it tends to produce that upon the suitableness or unsuitableness upon the proportion or disproportion which the affection seems to bear to the cause or object which excites it depends the propriety or impropriety the decency or ungracefulness of the consequent action and that upon the beneficial or hurtful effects which the affection proposes or tends to produce depends the merit or demerit the good or ill desert of the action to which it gives occasion Wherein consists our sense o  the propriety or impropriety of actions has been explained in the former part of thi  discourse We come now to consider wherein consists that of their good or ill desert  CHAP I That whatever appears to be the proper object of gratitude appears to deserve reward and that in the same manner whatever appears to be the proper object of resentment appears to deserve punishment  TO us therefore that action must appear to deserve reward which appears to be the proper and approved ob  ect of that sentiment which most immediately and directly prompts us to reward or to do good to another And in the same manner that action must appear to  eserve punishment which appears to be  he proper and approved object of that  entiment which most immediately and  irectly prompts us to punish or to inflict  vil upon another  The sentiment which most immediate  y and directly prompts us to reward is gratitude that which most immediately  nd directly prompts us to punish is re  entment  To us therefore that action must appear to deserve reward which appears to be the proper and approved object of gratitude as on the other hand that action must appear to deserve punishment which appears to be the proper and approved object of resentment  To reward is to recompense to remunerate to return good for good received To punish too is to recompense to remunerate though in a different manner it is to return evil for evil that has been done  There are some other passions besides gratitude and resentment which interest us in the happiness or misery of others but there are none which so directly excite us to be the instruments of either The love and esteem which grow upon acquaintance and habitual approbation necessarily lead us to be pleased with the good fortune of the man who is the object of such agreeable emotions and consequently to be willing to lend a hand to promote it Our love however is fully satisfied though his good fortune should be brought about without our assistance All that this passion desires is to see him  appy without regarding who was the  uthor of his prosperity But gratitude is  ot to be satisfied in this manner If the person to whom we owe many obliga  ions is made happy without our assist  nce though it pleases our love it does  ot content our gratitude Till we have  ecompensed him till we ourselves have  een instrumental in promoting his hap  iness we feel ourselves still loaded with  hat debt which his past services have laid  pon us  The hatred and dislike in the same manner which grow upon habitual dis  pprobation would often lead us to take  malicious pleasure in the misfortune  f the man whose conduct and character  xcite so painful a passion But though  islike and hatred harden us against all  ympathy and sometimes dispose us even  o rejoice at the distress of another yet  f there is no resentment in the case if  either we nor our friends have received  ny great personal provocation these  assions would not naturally lead us to wish to be instrumental in bringing it  bout Though we could fear no punishment in consequence of our having had  some hand in it we would rather that it should happen by other means To one under the dominion of violent hatred i  would be agreeable perhaps to hear th  the person whom he abhorred and detested was killed by some accident But if he had the least spark of justice which tho' thi  passion is not very favourable to virtue he might still have it would hurt him excessively to have been himself even witho  design the occasion of this misfortune Much more would the very thought of voluntarily contributing to it shock him beyond all measure He would reject wi  horror even the imagination of so execrable a design and if he could imagine himself capable of such an enormity he would begin to regard himself in the same odio  light in which he had considered the person who was the object of his dislike Bu  it is quite otherwise with resentment i  the person who had done us some great injury who had murdered our father or ou  brother for example should soon afterwards die of a fever or even be brought  the scaffold upon account of some othe  crime tho' it might sooth our hatred  would not fully gratify our resentment  Resentment would prompt us to desire not only that he should be punished but that he should be punished by our means and upon account of that particular injury which he had done to us Resentment cannot be fully gratified unless the offender is not only made to grieve in his turn but to grieve for that particular wrong which we have suffered from him He must be made to repent and be sorry for this very action that others thro' fear of the like punishment may be terrified from being guilty of the like offence The natural gratification of this passion tends of its own accord to produce all the political ends of punishment the correction of the criminal and the example to the public  Gratitude and resentment therefore are  he sentiments which most immediately and directly prompt to reward and to punish To us therefore he must appear to deserve reward who appears to be the proper and approved object of gratitude and he to deserve punishment who appears to be that of resentment  CHAP II Of the proper objects of gratitude and resentment  TO be the proper and approved object either of gratitude or resentment can mean nothing but to be the object of that gratitude and of that resentment which naturally seems proper and is approved of  But these as well as all the other passions of human nature seem proper and are approved of when the heart of every impartial spectator intirely sympathises with them when every indifferent bystander intirely enters into and goes along with them  He therefore appears to deserve reward who to some person or persons is the natural object of a gratitude which every human heart is disposed to beat time to and thereby applaud and he on the other hand appears to deserve punishment who in the same manner is to some person or persons the natural object of a resentment which the breast of every reasonable man  is ready to adopt and sympathise with To us surely that action must appear to deserve reward which every body who knows of it would wish to reward and therefore delights to see rewarded and that action must as surely appear to deserve punishment which every body who hears of it is angry with and upon that account rejoices to see punished  As we sympathize with the joy of our companions when in prosperity so we join with them in the complacency and satisfaction with which they naturally regard whatever is the cause of their good fortune We enter into the love and affection which they conceive for it and begin to love it too We should be sorry for their sakes if it was destroyed or even if it was placed at too great a distance from them and out of the reach of their care and protection tho' they should lose nothing by its absence except the pleasure of seeing it If it is man who has thus been the fortunate instrument of the happiness of his brethren this is still more peculiarly the case When we see one man assisted protected relieved by another our sympathy with the joy of the person who receives the  benefit serves only to animate our fellowfeeling with his gratitude towards him who bestows it When we look upon the person who is the cause of his pleasure with the eyes with which we imagine he must look upon him his benefactor seems to stand before us in the most engaging and amiable light We readily therefore sympathize with the grateful affection which he conceives for a person to whom he has been so much obliged and consequently applaud the returns which he is disposed to make for the good offices conferred upon him As we intirely enter into the affection from which these returns proceed they necessarily seem every way proper and suitable to their object  In the same manner as we sympathize with the sorrow of our fellowcreature whenever we see his distress so we likewise enter into his abhorrence and aversion for whatever has given occasion to it Our heart as it adopts and beats time to his grief so is it likewise animated with that spirit by which he endeavours to drive away or destroy the cause of it The indolent and passive fellowfeeling by which we accompany him in his sufferings  readily gives way to that more vigorous and active sentiment by which we go along with him in the effort he makes either to repel them or to gratify his aversion to what has given occasion to them This is still more peculiarly the case when it is man who has caused them When we see one man oppressed or injured by another the sympathy which we feel with the distress of the sufferer seems to serve only to animate our fellowfeeling with his resentment against the offender We are rejoiced to see him attack his adversary in his turn and are eager and ready to assist him whenever he exerts himself for defence or even for vengeance within a certain degree If the injured should perish in the quarrel we not only sympathize with the real resentment of his friends and relations but with the imaginary resentment which in fancy we lend to the dead who is no longer capable of feeling that or any other human sentiment But as we put ourselves in his situation as we enter as it were into his body and in our imaginations in some measure animate anew the deformed and mangled carcase of the slain when we bring home in this manner his  case to our own bosoms we feel upon this as upon many other occasions an emotion which the person principally concerned is incapable of feeling and which yet we feel by an illusive sympathy with him The sympathetic tears which we shed for that immense and irretrievable loss which in our fancy he appears to have sustained seem to be but a small part of the duty which we owe him The injury which he has suffered demands we think a principal part of our attention We feel that resentment which we imagine he ought to feel and which he would feel if in his cold and lifeless body there remained any consciousness of what passes upon earth His blood we think calls aloud for vengeance The very ashes of the dead seem to be disturbed at the thought that his injuries are to pass unrevenged The horrors which are supposed to haunt the bed of the murderer the ghosts which superstition imagines rise from their graves to demand vengeance upon those who brought them to an untimely end all take their origin from this natural sympathy with the imaginary resentment of the slain And with regard at least to this most dreadful of all crimes  nature antecedent to all reflexions upon the utility of punishment has in this manner stamped upon the human heart in the strongest and most indelible characters an immediate and instinctive approbation of the sacred and necessary law of retaliation  CHAP III That where there is no approbation of the conduct of the person who confers the benefit there is little sympathy with the gratitude of him who receives it and that on the contrary where there is no disapprobation of the motives of the person who does the mischief there is no sort of sympathy with the resentment of him who suffers it  IT is to be observed however that how beneficial soever on the one hand or how hurtful soever on the other the actions or intentions of the person who acts may have been to the person who is if I may say so acted upon yet if in the one case there appears to have been no propriety in the motives of the agent if we cannot enter into the affections which influenced  his conduct we have little sympathy with the gratitude of the person who receives the benefit or if in the other case there appears to have been no impropriety in the motives of the agent if on the contrary the affections which influenced his conduct are such as we must necessarily enter into we can have no sort of sympathy with the resentment of the person who suffers Little gratitude seems due in the one case and all sort of resentment seems unjust in the other The one action seems to merit little reward the other to deserve no punishment  First I say That wherever we cannot sympathize with the affections of the agent wherever there seems to be no propriety in the motives which influenced his conduct we are less disposed to enter into the gratitude of the person who received the benefit of his actions A very small return seems due to that foolish and profuse generosity which confers the greatest benefits from the most trivial motives and gives an estate to a man merely because his name and sirname happen to be the same with those of the giver Such services do not seem to demand any proportionable recompense  Our contempt for the folly of the agent hinders us from thoroughly entering into the gratitude of the person to whom the good office has been done His benefactor seems unworthy of it As when we place ourselves in the situation of the person obliged we feel that we could conceive no great reverence for such a benefactor we easily absolve him from a great deal of that submissive veneration and esteem which we should think due to a more respectable character and provided he always treats his weak friend with kindness and humanity we are willing to excuse him from many attentions and regards which we should demand to a worthier patron Those Princes who have heaped with the greatest profusion wealth power and honours upon their favourites have seldom excited that degree of attachment to their persons which has often been experienced by those who were more frugal of their favours The wellnatured but injudicious prodigality of James the First of Great Britain seems to have attached no body to his person and that Prince notwithstanding his social and harmless disposition appears to have lived and died without a friend The whole gentry  and nobility of England exposed their lives and fortunes in the cause of his more frugal and distinguishing son notwithstanding the coldness and distant severity of his ordinary deportment  Secondly I say That wherever the conduct of the agent appears to have been intirely directed by motives and affections which we thoroughly enter into and approve of▪ we can have no sort of sympathy with the resentment of the sufferer how great soevet the mischief which may have been done to him When two people quarrel if we take part with and intirely adopt the resentment of one of them it is impossible that we should enter into that of the other Our sympathy with the person whose motives we go along with and whom therefore we look upon as in the right cannot but harden us against all fellowfeeling with the other whom we necessarily regard as in the wrong Whatever this last therefore may have suffered while it is no more than what we ourselves should have wished him to suffer while it is no more than what our own sympathetic indignation would have prompted us to inflict upon him it cannot either displease or provoke  us When an inhuman murderer is brought to the scaffold tho' we have some compassion for his misery we can have no sort of fellowfeeling with his resentment if he should be so absurd as to express any against either his prosecutor or his judge The natural tendency of their just indignation against so vile a criminal is indeed the most fatal and ruinous to him But it is impossible that we should be displeased with the tendency of a sentiment which when we bring the case home to ourselves we feel that we cannot avoid adopting  CHAP IV Recapitulation of the foregoing chapters  WE do not therefore thoroughly and heartily sympathize with the gratitude of one man towards another merely because this other has been the cause of his good fortune unless he has been the cause of it from motives which we intirely go along with Our heart must adopt the principles of the agent and go along with all the affections which influenced his conduct before it can intirely  sympathize with and beat time to the gratitude of the person who has been benefited by his actions If in the conduct of the benefactor there appears to have been no propriety how beneficial soever its effects it does not seem to demand or necessarily to require any proportionable recompence  But when to the beneficent tendency of the action is joined the propriety of the affection from which it proceeds when we intirely sympathize and go along with the motives of the agent the love which we conceive for him upon his own account enhances and enlivens our fellowfeeling with the gratitude of those who owe their prosperity to his good conduct His actions seem then to demand and if I may say so to call aloud for a proportionable recompense We then intirely enter into that gratitude which prompts to bestow it The benefactor seems then to be the proper object of reward when we thus intirely sympathize with and approve of that sentiment which prompts to reward him When we approve of and go along with the affection from which the action proceeds we must necessarily approve of the  action and regard the person towards whom it is directed as its proper and suitable object  In the same manner we cannot at all sympathize with the resentment of one man against another merely because this other has been the cause of his misfortune unless he has been the cause of it from motives which we cannot enter into Before we can adopt the resentment of the sufferer we must disapprove of the motives of the agent and feel that our heart renounces all sympathy with the affections which influenced his conduct If there appears to have been no impropriety in these how fatal soever the tendency of the action which proceeds from them to those against whom it is directed it does not seem to deserve any punishment or to be the proper object of any resentment  But when to the hurtfulness of the action is joined the impropriety of the affection from whence it proceeds when our heart rejects with abhorrence all fellowfeeling with the motives of the agent we then heartily and intirely sympathize with the resentment of the sufferer Such actions seem then to deserve and if I may say so  to call aloud for a proportionable punishment and we intirely enter into and thereby approve of that resentment which prompts to inflict it The offender necessarily seems then to be the proper object of punishment when we thus intirely sympathize with and thereby approve of that sentiment which prompts to punish In this case too when we approve and go along with the affection from which the action proceeds we must necessarily approve of the action and regard the person against whom it is directed as its proper and suitable object  CHAP V The analysis of the sense of merit and demerit  AS our sense therefore of the propriety of conduct arises from what I shall call a direct sympathy with the affections and motives of the person who acts so our sense of its merit arises from what I shal  call an indirect sympathy with the gratitude of the person who is if I may say so acted upon  As we cannot indeed enter thoroughly into the gratitude of the person who receives the benefit unless we beforehand approve of the motives of the benefactor so upon this account the sense of merit seems to be a compounded sentiment and to be made up of two distinct emotions a direct sympathy with the sentiments of the agent and an indirect sympathy with the gratitude of those who receive the benefit of his actions  We may upon many different occasions plainly distinguish those two different emotions combining and uniting together in our sense of the good desert of a particular character or action When we  ead in history concerning actions of proper and beneficent greatness of mind how  agerly do we enter into such designs How much are we animated by that highspi  ited generosity which directs them How  een are we for their success How grieved at  heir disappointment In imagination we become the very person whose actions are  epresented to us we transport ourselves  n fancy to the scenes of those distant and forgotten adventures and imagine ourselves acting the part of a Scipio or a Camillus  a Timoleon or an Aristides So far our sentiments are founded upon the direct sympathy with the person who acts Nor is the indirect sympathy with those who receive the benefit of such actions less sensibly felt Whenever we place ourselves in the situation of these last with what warm and affectionate fellowfeeling do we enter into their gratitude towards those who served them so essentially We embrace as it were their benefactor along with them Our heart readily sympathizes with the highest transports of their grateful affection No honours no rewards we think can be too great for them to bestow upon him When they make this proper return for his services we heartily applaud and go along with them but are shocked beyond all measure if by their conduct they appear to have little sense of the obligations conferred upon them Our whole sense in short of the merit and good desert of such actions of the propriety and fitness of recompensing them and making the person who performed them rejoice in his turn arises from the sympathetic emotions of gratitude and love with which when we bring  home to our own breasts the situation of those principally concerned we feel ourselves naturally transported towards the man who could act with such proper and noble beneficence  In the same manner as our sense of the impropriety of conduct arises from a want of sympathy or from a direct antipathy to the affections and motives of the agent so our sense of its demerit arises from what I shall here too call an indirect sympathy with the resentment of the sufferer  As we cannot indeed enter into the resentment of the sufferer unless our heart beforehand disapproves the motives of the agent and renounces all fellowfeeling with them so upon this account the  ense of demerit as well as that of merit  eems to be a compounded sentiment and  o be made up of two distinct emotions  direct antipathy to the sentiments of the  gent and an indirect sympathy with the  esentment of the sufferer  We may here too upon many different  ccasions plainly distinguish those two  ifferent emotions combining and uniting  ogether in our sense of the ill desert of a  articular character or action When we  read in history concerning the perfidy and cruelty of a Borgia or a Nero our heart rises up against the detestable sentiment  which influenced their conduct and renounces with horror and abomination all fellowfeeling with such execrable motives So far our sentiments are founded upon the direct antipathy to the affections of the agent and the indirect sympathy with the resentment of the sufferers is still more sensibly felt When we bring home to ourselves the situation of the persons whom those scourges of mankind insulted murdered or betrayed what indignation do we not feel against such insolent and inhuman oppressors of the earth Our sympathy with the unavoidable distress of the innocent sufferers is not more real nor more lively than our fellowfeeling with their just and natural resentment The former sentiment only heightens the latter and the idea of their distress serves only to inflame and blow up our animosity against those who occasioned it When we think of the anguish of the sufferers we take part with them more earnestly against their oppressors we enter with more eagerness into all their schemes of vengeance and  feel ourselves every moment wreaking in imagination upon such violators of the laws of society that punishment which our sympathetic indignation tells us is due to their crimes Our sense of the horror and dreadful atrocity of such conduct the delight which we take in hearing that it was properly punished the indignation which we feel when it escapes this due retaliation our whole sense and feeling in short of its ill desert of the propriety and fitness of inflicting evil upon the person who is guilty of i  and of making him grieve in his turn arises from the sympathetic indignation which naturally boils up in the breast of the spectator whenever he thoroughly brings home to himself the case of the sufferer  To ascribe in this manner our natural sense of the ill desert of human actions to a sympathy with the resentment of the sufferer may seem to the greater part of people to be a degradation of that sentiment Resentment is commonly regarded as so odious a passion that they will be apt to think it impossible that so laudable a principle as the sense of the ill desert of vice should in any respect be founded upon it They will be more willing perhaps to admit that our sense of the merit of good actions is founded upon a sympathy with the gratitude of the persons who receive the benefit of them because gratitude as well as all the other benevolent passions is regarded as an amiable principle  which can take nothing from the worth of whatever is founded upon it Gratitude and resentment however are in every respect it is evident counterparts of one another and if our sense of merit arises from a sympathy with the one our sense of demerit can scarce miss to proceed from a fellowfeeling with the other  Let it be considered too that resentment tho' in the degrees in which we too often see it the most odious perhaps of all the passions is not disapproved of when properly humbled and intirely brought down to the level of the sympathetic indignation of the spectator When we who are the bystanders feel that our own animosity intirely corresponds with that of the sufferer when the resentment of this last does not in any respect go beyond our own when no word no gesture escapes him that denotes an emotion more violent than what we can keep time to and when he never aims at inflicting any punishment beyond what we should rejoice to see inflicted or what we ourselves would upon his account even desire to be the instruments of inflicting it is impossible that we should not intirely approve of his sentiments Our own emotion in this case must in our eyes undoubtedly justify his And as experience teaches us how much the greater part of mankind are incapable of his moderation and how great an effort must be made in order to bring down the rude and undisciplined impulse of resentment to this suitable temper we cannot avoid conceiving a considerable degree of esteem and admiration for one who appears capable of exerting so much selfcommand over one of the most ungovernable passions of his nature When indeed the animosity of the sufferer exceeds as it almost always does what we can go along with as we cannot enter into it we necessarily disapprove of it We even disapprove of it more than we should of an equal excess of almost any other passion derived from the imagination And this too violent resentment instead of carrying us along with it becomes itself the object of our resentment and indignation We enter into the opposite resentment of the person who is the object of this unjust emotion  and who is in danger of suffering from it Revenge therefore the excess of resentment appears to be the most detestable of all the passions and is the object of the horror and indignation of every body And as in the way in which this passion commonly discovers itself among mankind it is excessive a hundred times for once that it is moderate we are very apt to consider it as a  together odious and detestable because in its most ordinary appearances it is so Nature however even in the present depraved state of mankind does not seem to have dealt so unkindly with us as to have endowed us with any principle which is wholly and in every respect evil or which in no degree and in no direction can be the proper object of praise and approbation Upon some occasions we are sensible that this passion which is generally too strong may likewise be too weak We sometimes complain that a particular person shows too little spirit and has too little sense of the injuries that have been done to him and we are as ready to despise him for the defect as to hate him for the excess of this passion  The inspired writers would not surely have talked so frequently or so strongly of the wrath and anger of God if they had regarded every degree of those passions as vicious and evil even in so weak and imperfect a creature as man  Let it be considered too that the present inquiry is not concerning a matter of right if I may say so but concerning a matter of fact We are not at present examining upon what principles a perfect being would approve of the punishment of bad actions but upon what principles so weak and imperfect a creature as man actually and in fact approves of it The principles which I have just now mentioned it is evident have a very great effect upon his sentiments and it seems wisely ordered that it should be so The very existence of society requires that unmerited and unprovoked malice should be restrained by proper punishments and consequently that to inflict those punishments should be regarded as a proper and laudable action Though  man therefore be naturally endowed with a desire of the welfare and preservation of society yet the author of nature has not intrusted it to his reason to find out that a certain application of punishments is the proper means of attaining this end but has endowed him with an immediate and instinctive approbation of that very application which is most proper to attain it The oeconomy of nature is in this respect exactly of a piece with what it is upon many other occasions With regard to all those ends which upon account of their peculiar importance may be regarded if such an expression is allowable as the favourite ends of nature she has constantly in this manner not only endowed mankind with an appetite for the end which she proposes but likewise with an appetite for the means by which alone this end can be brought about for their own sakes and independent of their tendency to produce it Thus selfpreservation and the propagation of the species are the great ends which nature seems to have proposed in the formation of all animals Mankind are endowed with a desire of those ends and an aversion to the contrary with a love of life and a dread of dissolution with a desire of the continuance and perpetuity of the species and with an aversion to the thoughts of its intire extinction But tho' we are in this manner endowed with a very strong desire of those ends it has not been intrusted to the slow and uncertain determinations of our reason to find out the proper means of bringing them about Nature has directed us to the greater part of these by original and immediate instincts Hunger thirst the passion which unites the two sexes the love of pleasure and the dread of pain prompt us to apply those means for their own sakes and without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends which the great director of nature intended to produce by them  Before I conclude this note I must take notice of a difference between the approbation of propriety and that of merit or beneficence Before we approve of the sentiments of any person as proper and suitable to their  objects we must not only be affected in the same manner as he is but we must perceive this harmony and correspondence of sentiments between him and ourselves Thus tho' upon hearing of a misfortune that had befallen my friend I should conceive precisely that degree of concern which he gives way to yet till I am informed of the manner in which he behaves till I perceive the harmony between his emotions and mine I cannot be said to approve of the sentiments which influence his behaviour The approbation of propriety therefore requires not only that we should intirely sympathize with the person who acts but that we should perceive this perfect concord between his sentiments and our own On the contrary when I hear of a benefit that has been bestowed upon another person let him who has received it be affected in what manner he pleases if by bringing his case home to myself I feel gratitude arise in my own breast I necessarily approve of the conduct of his benefactor and regard it as meritorious and the proper object of reward Whether the person who has received the benefit conceives gratitude or not cannot it is evident in any degree alter our sentiments with regard to the merit of him who has bestowed it No actual correspondence of sentiments therefore is here required It is sufficient that if he was grateful they would correspond and our sense of merit is often founded upon one of those illusive sympathies by which when we bring home to ourselves the case of another we are often affected in a manner in which the person principally concerned is incapable of being affected There is a similar difference between our d  sapprobation of demerit and that of impropriety    SECTION II Of justice and beneficence  CHAP I Comparison of those two virtues  ACTIONS of a beneficent tendency which proceed from proper motives seem alone to require reward because such alone are the approved objects of gratitude or excite the sympathetic gratitude of the spectator  Actions of a hurtful tendency which proceed from improper motives seem alone to deserve punishment because such alone are the approved objects of resentment or excite the sympathetic resentment of the spectator  Beneficence is always free it cannot be extorted by force the meer want of it exposes to no punishment because the meer want of beneficence tends to do no real positive evil It may disappoint of the good which might reasonably have been expected and upon that account it may  justly excite dislike and disapprobation it cannot however provoke any resentment which mankind will go along with The man who does not recompence his benefactor when he has it in his power and when his benefactor needs his assistance is no doubt guilty of the blackest ingratitude The heart of every impartial spectator rejects all fellowfeeling with the selfishness of his motives and he is the proper object of the highest disapprobation But still he does no posiive hurt to anybody he only does not do that good which in propriety he ought to have done He is the object of hatred a passion which is naturally excited by impropriety of sentiment and behaviour not of resentment a passion which is never properly called forth but by actions which tend to do real and positive hurt to some particular persons His want of gratitude therefore cannot be punished To oblige him by force to perform what ingratitude he ought to perform and what every impartial spectator would approve of him for performing would if possible be still more improper than his neglecting to perform it His benefactor would dishonour himself if he  attempted by violence to constrain him to gratitude and it would be impertinent for any third person who was not the superior of either to intermeddle But of all the duties of beneficence those which gratitude recommends to us approach nearest to what is called a perfect and compleat obligation What friendship what generosity what charity would prompt us to do with universal approbation is still more free and can still less be extorted by force than the duties of gratitude We talk of the debt of gratitude not of charity or generosity nor even of friendship when friendship is meer esteem and has not been enhanced and complicated with gratitude for good offices  Resentment seems to have been given us by nature for defence and for defence only It is the safeguard of justice and the security of innocence It prompts us to beat off the mischief which is attempted to be done to us and to retaliate that which is already done that the offender may be made to repent of his injustice and that others through fear of the like punishment may be terrified from being guilty of the like offence It must be reserved therefore  for these purposes nor can the spectator ever go along with it when it is exerted for any other But the meer want of the beneficent virtues though it may disappoint us of the good which might reasonably be expected neither does nor attempts to do any mischief from whch we can have occasion to defend ourselves  There is however another virtue of which the observance is not left to the freedom of our own wills which may be extorted by force and of which the violation exposes to resentment and consequently to punishment This virtue is justice the violation of justice is injury it does real and positive hurt to some particular persons from motives which are naturally disapproved of It is therefore the proper object of resentment and of punishment which is the natural consequence of resentment As mankind go along with and approve of the violence employed to avenge the hurt which is done by injustice so they much more go along with and approve of that which is employed to prevent and beat off the injury and to restrain the offender from hurting his neighbours The person himself who meditates  an injustice is sensible of this and feels that force may with the utmost propriety be made use of both by the person whom he is about to injure and by others either to obstruct the execution of his crime or to punish him when he has executed it And upon this is founded that remarkable distinction between justice and all the other social virtues which has of late been particularly insisted upon by an author of very great and original genius that we feel ourselves to be under a stricter obligation to act according to justice than agreeably to friendship charity or generosity that the practice of these last mentioned virtues seems to be left in some measure to our own choice but that somehow or other we feel ourselves to be in a peculiar manner tyed bound and obliged to the observation of justice We feel that is to say that force may with the utmost propriety and with the approbation of all mankind be made use of to constrain us to observe the rules of the one but not to follow the precepts of the other  We must always however carefully distinguish what is only blameable or the proper object of disapprobation from what  force may be employed either to punish or to prevent That seems blameable which falls short of that ordinary degree of proper beneficence which experience teaches us to expect of every body and on the contrary that seems praiseworthy which goes beyond it The ordinary degree itself seems neither blameable nor praiseworthy A father a son a brother who behaves to the correspondent relation neither better nor worse than the greater part of men commonly do seems properly to deserve neither praise nor blame He who surprises us by extraordinary and unexpected though still proper and suitable kindness or on the contrary by extraordinary and unexpected as well as unsuitable unkindness seems praiseworthy in the one case and blameable in the other  Even the most ordinary degree of kindness or beneficence however cannot among equals be extorted by force Among equals each individual is naturally and antecedent to the institution of civil government regarded as having a right both to defend himself from injuries and to exact a certain degree of punishment for those which have been done to him Every generous  spectator not only approves of his conduct when he does this but enters so far into his sentiments as often to be willing to assist him When one man attacks or robs or attempts to murder another all the neighbours take the alarm and think that they do right when they run either to revenge the person who has been injured or to defend him who is in danger of being so But when a father fails in the ordinary degree of parental affection towards a son when a son seems to want that filial reverence which might be expected to his father when brothers are without the usual degree of brotherly affection when a man shuts his▪ breast against compassion and refuses to relieve the misery of his fellowcreatures when he can with the greatest ease in all these cases though every body blames the conduct nobody imagines that those who might have reason perhaps to expect more kindness have any right to extort it by force The sufferer can only complain and the spectator can intermeddle no other way than by advice and persuasion Upon all such occasions for equals to use force against one another would  be thought the highest degree of insolence and presumption  A superior may indeed sometimes with universal approbation oblige those under his jurisdiction to behave in this respect with a certain degree of propriety to one another The laws of all civilized nations oblige parents to maintain their children and children to maintain their parents and impose upon men many other duties of beneficence The civil magistrate is entrusted with the power not only of preserving the public peace by restraining injustice but of promoting the prosperity of the commonwealth by establishing good discipline and by discouraging every sort of vice and impropriety he may prescribe rules therefore which not only prohibit mutual injuries among fellowcitizens but command mutual good offices to a certain degree When the sovereign commands what is meerly indifferent and what antecedent to his orders might have been omitted without any blame it becomes not only blameable but punishable to disobey him When he commands therefore what antecedent to any such order could not have been omitted without the greatest blame it surely  becomes much more punishable to be wanting in obedience Of all the duties of a lawgiver however this perhaps is what it requires the greatest delicacy and reserve to execute with propriety and judgment To neglect it altogether exposes the commonwealth to many gross disorders and shocking enormities and to push it too far is destructive of all liberty security and justice  Though the meer want of beneficence seems to merit no punishment from equals the greater exertions of that virtue appear to deserve the highest reward By being productive of the greatest good they are the natural and approved objects of the liveliest gratitude Though the breach of justice on the contrary exposes to punishment the observation of the rules of that virtue seems scarce to deserve any reward There is no doubt a propriety in the practice of justice and it merits upon that account all the approbation which is due to propriety But as it does no real positive good it is entitled to very little gratitude Meer justice is upon most occasions but a negative virtue and only hinders us from hurting our neighbour  The man who barely abstains from violating either the person or the estate or the reputation of his neighbours has surely very little positive merit He fulfils however all the rules of what is peculiarly called justice and does every thing which his equals can with propriety force him to do or which they can punish him for not doing We may often fulfil all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing  As every man doth so shall it be done to him and retaliation seems to be the great law which is dictated to us by nature Beneficence and generosity we think due to the generous and benificent Those whose hearts never open to the feelings of humanity should we think be shut out in the same manner from the affections of all their fellowcreatures and be allowed to live in the midst of society as in a great desart where there is nobody to care for them or to enquire after them The violator of the laws of justice ought to be made to feel himself that evil which he has done to another and since no regard to the sufferings of his brethren is capable of restraining him he ought to  be overawed by the fear of his own The man who is barely innocent who only observes the laws of justice with regard to others and meerly abstains from hurting his neighbours can merit only that his neighbours in their turn should respect his innocence and that the same laws should be religiously observed with regard to him  CHAP II Of the sense of justice of remorse and of the consciousness of merit  THERE can be no proper motive for hurting our neighbour there can be no incitement to do evil to another which mankind will go along with except just indignation for evil which that other has done to us To disturb his happiness meerly because it stands in the way of our own to take from him what is of real use to him meerly because it may be of equal or of more use to us or to indulge in this manner at the expence of other people the natural preference which every man has for his own happiness above that of  other people is what no impartial spectator can go along with Every man is no doubt by nature first and principally recommended to his own care and as he is fitter to take care of himself than of any other person it is fit and right that it should be so Every man therefore is much more deeply interested in whatever immediately concerns himself than in what concerns any other man and to hear perhaps of the death of another person with whom we have no particular connection will give us less concern will spoil our stomach or break our rest much less than a very insignificant disaster which has befallen ourselves But tho' the ruin of our neighbour may affect us much less than a very small misfortune of our own we must not ruin him to prevent that small misfortune nor even to prevent our own ruin We must here as in all other cases view ourselves not so much according to that light in which we may naturally appear to ourselves as according to that in which we naturally appear to others Tho' every man may according to the proverb be the whole world to himself to the rest of mankind he is a most insignificant part of  it Tho' his own happiness may be of more importance to him than that of all the world besides to every other person it is of no more consequence than that of any other man Tho' it may be true therefore that every individual in his own breast naturally prefers himself to all mankind yet he dares not look mankind in the face and avow that he acts according to this principle He feels that in this preference they can never go along with him and that how natural soever it may be to him it must always appear excessive and extravagant to them When he views himself in the light in which he is conscious that others will view him he sees that to them he is but one of the multitude in no respect better than any other in it If he would act so as that the impartial spectator may enter into the principles of his conduct which is what of all things he has the greatest desire to do he must upon this as upon all other occasions humble the arrogance of his selflove and bring it down to something which other men can go along with They will indulge it so far as to allow him to be more anxious about and to pursue with more earnest assiduity his own happiness  than that of any other person Thus far whenever they place themselves in his situation they will readily go along with him In the race for wealth and honours and preferments he may run as hard as he can and strain every nerve and every muscle in order to outstrip all his competitors But if he should justle or throw down any of them the indulgence of the spectators is entirely at an end It is a violation of fair play which they cannot admit of This man is to them in every respect as good as he they do not enter into that selflove by which he prefers himself so much to this other and cannot go along with the motive from which he hurt him They readily therefore sympathize with the natural resentment of the injured and the offender becomes the object of their hatred and indignation He is sensible that he becomes so and feels that those sentiments are ready to burst out from all sides against him  As the greater and more irreparable the evil that is done the resentment of the sufferers runs naturally the higher so does likewise the sympathetic indignation of the spectator as well as the sense of guilt in the  agent Death is the greatest evil which one man can inflict upon another and excites the highest degree of resentment in those who are immediately connected with the slain Murder therefore is the most atrocious of all crimes which affect individuals only in the sight both of mankind and of the person who has committed it To be deprived of that which we are possessed of is a greater evil than to be disappointed of what we have only the expectation Breach of property therefore theft and robbery which take from us what we are possessed of are greater crimes than breach of contract which only disappoints us of what we expected The most sacred laws of justice therefore those whose violation seems to call loudest for vengeance and punishment are the laws which guard the life and person of our neighbour the next are those which guard his property and possessions and last of all come those which guard what are called his personal rights or what is due to him from the promi  es of others  The violator of the more sacred laws of justice can never reflect on the sentiments which mankind must entertain with regard  to him without feeling all the agonies of shame and horror and consternation When his passion is gratified and he begins coolly to reflect on his past conduct he can enter into none of the motives which influenced it They appear now as detestable to him as they did always to other people By sympathizing with the hatred and abhorrence which other men must entertain for him he becomes in some measure the object of his own hatred and abhorrence The situation of the person who suffered by his injustice now calls upon his pity He is grieved at the thought of it regrets the unhappy effects of his own conduct and feels at the same time that they have rendered him the proper object of the resentment and indignation of mankind and of what is the natural consequence of resentment vengeance and punishment The thought of this perpetually haunts him and fills him with terror and amazement He dares no longer look society in the face but imagines himself as it were rejected and thrown out from the affections of all mankind He cannot hope for the consolation of sympathy in this his greatest and most dreadful  distress The remembrance of his crimes has shut out all fellowfeeling with him from the hearts of his fellowcreatures The sentiments which they entertain with regard to him are the very thing which he is most afraid of Every thing seems hostile and he would be glad to fly to some inhospitable desert where he might never more behold the face of a human creature nor read in the countenance of mankind the condemnation of his crimes But solitude is still more dreadful than society His own thoughts can present him with nothing but what is black unfortunate and disastrous the melancholy forebodings of incomprehensible misery and ruin The horror of solitude drives him back into society and he comes again into the presence of mankind astonished to appear before them loaded with shame and distracted with fear in order to supplicate some little protection from the countenance of those very judges who he knows have already all unanimously condemned him Such is the nature of that sentiment which is properly called remorse of all the sentiments which can enter the human breast the most dreadful It is made up of shame  from the sense of the impropriety of past conduct of grief for the effects of it of pity for those who suffer by it and of the dread and terror of punishment from the consciousness of the justly provoked resentment of all rational creatures  The opposite behaviour naturally inspires the opposite sentiment The man who not from frivolous fancy but from proper motives has performed a generous action when he looks forward to those whom he has served feels himself to be the natural object of their love and gratitude and by sympathy with them of the esteem and approbation of all mankind And when he looks backward to the motive from which he acted and surveys it in the light in which the indifferent spectator will survey it he still continues to enter into it and applauds himself by sympathy with the approbation of this supposed impartial judge In both these points of view his own conduct appears to him every way agreeable His mind at the thought of it is filled with chearfulness serenity and composure He is in friendship and harmony with all mankind and looks upon his fellowcreatures with confidence and  benevolent satisfaction secure that he has rendered himself worthy of their most favourable regards In the combination of all these sentiments consists the consciousness of merit or of deserved reward  CHAP III Of the utility of this constitution of nature  IT is thus that man who can subsist only in society was fitted by nature to that situation for which he was made All the members of human society stand in need of each others assistance and are likewise exposed to mutual injuries Where the necessary assistance is reciprocally afforded from love from gratitude from friendship and esteem the society flourishes and is happy All the different members of it are bound together by the agreeable bands of love and affection and are as it were drawn to one common centre of mutual good offices  But tho' the necessary assistance should not be afforded from such generous and disinterested  motives tho' among the different members of the society there should be no mutual love and affection the society tho' less happy and agreeable will not necessarily be dissolved Society may subsist among different men as among different merchants from a sense of its utility without any mutual love or affection and tho' no one man in it should owe any obligation or be bound in gratitude to any other it may still be upheld by a mercenary exchange of good offices according to an agreed valuation  Society however cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another The moment that injury begins the moment that mutual resentment and animosity take place all the bands of it are broke asunder and the different members of which it consisted are as it were dissipated and scattered abroad by the violence and opposition of their discordant affections If there is any society among robbers and murderers they must at least according to the trite observation abstain from robbing and murdering one another Beneficence therefore is less essential to the existence of society than  justice Society may subsist tho' not in the most comfortable state without beneficence but the prevalence of injustice must utterly destroy it  Tho' nature therefore exhorts mankind to acts of beneficence by the pleasing consciousness of deserved reward she has not thought it necessary to guard and enforce the practice of it by the terrors of merited punishment in case it should be neglected It is the ornament which embellishes not the foundation which supports the building and which it was therefore sufficient to recommend but by no means necessary to impose Justice on the contrary is the main pillar that upholds the whole edifice If it is removed the great the immense fabric of human society that fabric which to raise and to support seems in this world if I may say so to have been the peculiar and darling care of nature must in a moment crumble into atoms To enforce the observation of justice therefore nature has implanted in the human breast that consciousness of illdesert those terrors of merited punishment which attend upon its violation as the great safeguards of the association of mankind to protect  the weak to curb the violent and to chastize the guilty Men tho' naturally sympathetic feel so little for another with whom they have no particular connection in comparison of what they feel for themselves the misery of one who is merely their fellowcreature is of so little importance to them in comparison even of a small conveniency of their own they have it so much in their power to hurt him and may have so many temptations to do so that if this principle did not stand up within them in his defence and overawe them into a respect for his innocence they would like wild beasts be at all times ready to fly upon him and a man would enter an assembly of men as he enters a den of lions  In every part of the universe we observe means adjusted with the nicest artifice to the ends which they are intended to produce and in the mechanism of a plant or animal body admire how every thing is contrived for advancing the two great purposes of nature the support of the individual and the propogation of the species But in these and in all such objects we still distinguish the efficient from the final cause of their several motions and organizations  The digestion of the food the circulation of the blood and the secretion of the several juices which are drawn from it are operations all of them necessary for the great purposes of animal life Yet we never endeavour to account for them from those purposes as from their efficient causes nor imagine that the blood circulates or that the food digests of its own accord and with a view or intention to the purposes of circulation or digestion The wheels of the watch are all admirably adjusted to the end for which it was made the pointing of the hour All their various motions conspire in the nicest manner to produce this effect If they were endowed with a desire and intention to produce it they could not do it better Yet we never ascribe any such desire or intention to them but to the watchmaker and we know that they are put into motion by a spring which intends the effect it produces as little as they do But tho' in accounting for the operations of bodies we never fail to distinguish in this manner the efficient from the final cause in accounting for those of the mind we are very apt to confound these two different things with  one another When by natural principles we are led to advance those ends which a refined and enlightened reason would recommend to us we are very apt to impute to that reason as to their efficient cause the sentiments and actions by which we advance those ends and to imagine that to be the wisdom of man which in reality is the wisdom of God Upon a superficial view this cause seems sufficient to produce the effects which are ascribed to it and the system of human nature seems to be more simple and agreeable when all its different operations are in this manner deduced from a single principle  As society cannot subsist unless the laws of justice are tolerably observed as no social intercourse can take place among men who do not generally abstain from injuring one another the consideration of this necessity it has been thought was the ground upon which we approved of the enforcement of the laws of justice by the punishment of those who violated them Man it has been said has a natural love for society and desires that the union of mankind should be preserved for its own sake and tho' he himself was to derive no benefit from  it The orderly and flourishing state of society is agreeable to him and he takes delight in contemplating it It's disorder and confusion on the contrary is the object of his aversion and he is chagrined at whatever tends to produce it He is sensible too that his own interest is connected with the prosperity of society and that the happiness perhaps the preservation of his existence depends upon its preservation Upon every account therefore he has an abhorrence at whatever can tend to destroy society and is willing to make use of every means which can hinder so hated and so dreadful an event Injustice necessarily tends to destroy it Every appearance of injustice therefore alarms him and he runs if I may say so to stop the progress of what if allowed to go on would quickly put an end to every thing that is dear to him If he cannot restrain it by gentle and fair means he must beat it down by force and violence and at any rate must put a stop to its further progress Hence it is they say that he often approves of the enforcement of the laws of justice even by the capital punishment of those who viola  e them The disturber of  the public peace is hereby removed out of the world and others are terrified by his fate from imitating his example  Such is the account commonly given of our approbation of the punishment of injustice And so far this account is undoubtedly true that we frequently have occasion to confirm our natural sense of the propriety and fitness of punishment by reflecting how necessary it is for preserving the order of society When the guilty is about to suffer that just retaliation which the natural indignation of mankind tells them is due to his crimes when the insolence of his injustice is broken and humbled by the terror of his approaching punishment when he ceases to be an object of fear with the generous and humane he begins to be an object of pity The thought of what he is about to suffer extinguishes their resentment for the sufferings of others to which he has given occasion They are disposed to pardon and forgive him and to save him from that punishment which in all their cool hours they had considered as the retribution due to such crimes Here therefore they have occasion to call to their assistance the consideration of the  general interest of society They counterbalance the impulse of this weak and partial humanity by the dictates of a humanity that is more generous and comprehensive They reflect that mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent and oppose to the emotions of compassion which they feel for a particular person a more enlarged compassion which they feel for mankind  Sometimes too we have occasion to defend the propriety of observing the general rules of justice by the consideration of their necessity to the support of society We frequently hear the young and the licentious ridiculing the most sacred rules of morality and professing sometimes from the corruption but more frequently from the vanity of their hearts the most abominable maxims of conduct Our indignation rouses and we are eager to refute and expose such detestable principles But tho' it is their intrinsic hatefulness and detestableness which originally inflames us against them we are unwilling to assign this as the sole reason why we condemn them or to pretend that it is merely because we ourselves hate and detest them  The reason we think would not appear to be conclusive Yet why should it not if we hate and detest them because they are the natural and proper objects of hatred and detestation But when we are asked why we should not act in such or such a manner the very question seems to suppose that to those who ask it this manner of acting does not appear to be for its own sake the natural and proper object of those sentiments We must show them therefore that it ought to be so for the sake of something else Upon this account we generally cast about for other arguments and the consideration which first occurs to us is the disorder and confusion of society which would result from the universal prevalence of such practices We seldom fail therefore to insist upon this topic  But tho' it commonly requires no great discernment to see the destructive tendency of all licentious practices to the welfare of society it is seldom this consideration which first animates us against them All men even the most stupid and unthinking abhor fraud perfidy and injustice and delight to see them punished But few men have reflected upon the necessity  of justice to the existence of society how obvious soever that necessity may appear to be  That it is not a regard to the preservation of society which originally interests us in the punishment of crimes committed against individuals may be demonstrated by many obvious considerations The concern which we take in the fortune and happiness of individuals does not in common cases arise from that which we take in the fortune and happiness of society We are no more concerned for the destruction or loss of a single man because this man is a member or part of society and because we should be concerned for the destruction of society than we are concerned for the loss of a single guinea because this guinea is a part of a thousand guineas and because we should be concerned for the loss of the whole sum In neither case does our regard for the individuals arise from our regard for the multitude but in both cases our regard for the multitude is compounded and made up of the particular regards which we feel for the different individuals of which it is composed As when a small sum is unjustly taken from  us we do not so much prosecute the injury from a regard to the preservation of our whole fortune as from a regard to that particular sum which we have lost so when a single man is injured or destroyed we demand the punishment of the wrong that has been done to him not so much from a concern for the general interest of society as from a concern for that very individual who has been injured It is to be observed however that this concern does not necessarily include in it any degree of those exquisite sentiments which are commonly called love esteem and affection and by which we distinguish our particular friends and acquaintance The concern which is requisite for this is no more than the general fellowfeeling which we have with every man merely because he is our fellowcreature We enter into the resentment even of an odious person when he is injured by those to whom he has given no provocation Our disapprobation of his ordinary character and conduct does not in this case altogether prevent our fellowfeeling with his natural indignation tho' with those who are not either extremely candid or who have not been accustomed  to correct and regulate their natural sentiments by general rules it is very apt to damp it  Upon some occasions indeed we both punish and approve of punishment merely from a view to the general interest of society which we imagine cannot otherwise be secured Of this kind are all the punishments inflicted for breaches of what is called either civil police or military discipline Such crimes do not immediately or directly hurt any particular person but their remote consequences it is supposed do produce or might produce either a considerable inconveniency or a great disorder in the society A centinel for example who falls asleep upon his watch suffers death by the laws of war because such carelessness might endanger the whole army This severity may upon many occasions appear necessary and for that reason just and proper When the preservation of an individual is inconsistent with the safety of a multitude nothing can be more just than that the many should be preferred to the one Yet this punishment how necessary soever always appears to be excessively severe The natural atrocity of  the crime seems to be so little and the punishment so great that it is with difficulty that our heart can reconcile itself to it Though such carelessness appears very blameable yet the thought of this crime does not naturally excite any such resentment as would prompt us to take such dreadful revenge A man of humanity must recollect himself must make an effort and exert his whole firmness and resolution before he can bring himself either to inflict it or to go along with it when it is inflicted by others It is not however in this manner that he looks upon the just punishment of an ungrateful murderer or parricide His heart in this case applauds with ardour and even with transport the just retaliation which seems due to such detestable crimes and which if by any accident they should happen to escape he would be highly enraged and disappointed The very different sentiments with which the spectator views those different punishments is a proof that his approbation of the one is far from being founded upon the same principles with that of the other He looks upon the centinel as an unfortunate victim who indeed  must and ought to be devoted to the safety of numbers but whom still in his heart he would be glad to save and he is only sorry that the interest of the many should oppose it But if the murderer should escape from punishment it would excite his highest indignation and he would call upon God to avenge in another world that crime which the injustice of mankind had neglected to chastise upon earth  For it well deserves to be taken notice of that we are so far from imagining that injustice ought to be punished in this life merely on account of the order of society which cannot otherwise be maintained that nature teaches us to hope and religion authorises us to expect that it will be punished even in a life to come Our sense of its ill desert pursues it if I may say so even beyond the grave though the example of its punishment there cannot serve to deter the rest of mankind who see it not who know it not from being guilty of the like practices here The justice of God however we think still requires that he should hereafter avenge the injuries  of the widow and the fatherless who are here so often insulted with impunity  That the Deity loves virtue and hates vice as a voluptuous man loves riches and hates poverty not for their own sakes but for the effects which they tend to produce that he loves the one only because it promotes the happiness of society which his benevolence prompts him to desire and that he hates the other only because it occasions the misery of mankind which the same divine quality renders the object of his aversion is not the doctrine of nature but of an artificial though ingenious refinement of philosophy All our natural sentiments prompt us to believe that as perfect virtue is supposed necessarily to appear to the Deity as it does to us for its own sake and without any further view the natural and proper object of love and reward so must vice of hatred and punishment That the gods neither resent nor hurt was the general maxim of all the different sects of the ancient philosophy and if by resenting be understood that violent and disorderly perturbation which often distracts and confounds the human breast or if by hurting be understood  the doing mischief wantonly and without regard to propriety or justice such weakness is undoubtedly unworthy of the divine perfection But if it be meant that vice does not appear to the Deity to be for its own sake the object of abhorrence and aversion and what for its own sake it is fit and right should be punished the truth of this maxim can by no means be so easily admitted If we consult our natural sentiments we are apt to fear lest before the holiness of God vice should appear to be more worthy of punishment than the weakness and imperfection of human virtue can ever seem to be of reward Man when about to appear before a being of infinite perfection can feel but little confidence in his own merit or in the imperfect propriety of his own conduct In the presence of his fellowcreatures he may often justly elevate himself and may often have reason to think highly of his own character and conduct compared to the still greater imperfection of theirs But the case is quite different when about to appear before his infinite Creator To such a being he can scarce imagine that his littleness and weakness should ever seem  to be the proper object either of esteem or of reward But he can easily conceive▪ how the numberless violations of duty of which he has been guilty should render him the proper object of aversion and punishment neither can he see any reason why the divine indignation should not be let loose without any restraint upon so vile an insect as he is sensible that he himself must appear to be If he would still hope for happiness he is conscious that he cannot demand it from the justice but that he must entreat it from the mercy of God Repentance sorrow humiliation contrition at the thought of his past conduct are upon this account the sentiments which become him and seem to be the only means which he has left for appeasing that wrath which he knows he has justly provoked He even distrusts the efficacy of all these and naturally fears lest the wisdom of God should not like the weakness of man be prevailed upon to spare the crime by the most importunate lamentations of the criminal Some other intercession some other sacrifice some other atonement he imagines must be made for him beyond what he himself is capable  of making before the purity of the divine justice can be reconciled to his manifold offences The doctrines of revelation coincide in every respect with those original anticipations of nature and as they teach us how little we can depend upon the imperfection of our own virtue so they show us at the same time that the most powerful intercession has been made and that the most dreadful atonement has been paid for our manifold transgressions and iniquities  SECT III Of the influence of fortune upon the sentiments of mankind with regard to the merit or demerit of actions  INTRODUCTION  WHATEVER praise or blame can be due to any action must belong either first to the intention or affection of the heart from which it proceeds or secondly to the external action or movement of the body which this affection gives occasion to or last to all the good or bad consequences which actually and in fact proceed from it These three different things constitute the whole nature and circumstances of the action and must be the foundation of whatever quality can belong to it  That the two last of these three circumstances cannot be the foundation of any praise or blame is abundantly evident nor has the contrary ever been asserted by  any body The external action or movement of the body is often the same in the most innocent and in the most blameable actions He who shoots a bird and he who shoots a man both of them perform the same external movement each of them draws the tricker of a gun The consequences which actually and in fact happen to proceed from any action are if possible still more indifferent either to praise or blame than even the external movement of the body As they depend not upon the agent but upon fortune they cannot be the proper foundation for any sentiment of which his character and conduct are the objects  The only consequences for which he can be answerable or by which he can deserve either approbation or disapprobation of any kind are those which were some way or other intended or those which at least show some agreeable or disagreeable quality in the intention of the heart from which he acted To the intention or affection of the heart therefore to the propriety or impropriety to the beneficence or hurtfulness of the design all praise or blame all approbation or disapprobation  of any kind which can justly be bestowed upon any action must ultimately belong  When this maxim is thus proposed in abstract and general terms there is no body who does not agree to it It's selfevident justice is acknowledged by all the world and there is not a dissenting voice among all mankind Every body allows that how different soever the accidental the unintended and unforeseen consequences of different actions yet if the intentions or affections from which they arose were on the one hand equally proper and equally beneficent or on the other equally improper and equally malevolent the merit or demerit of the actions is still the same and the agent is equally the suitable object either of gratitude or of resentment  But how well soever we may seem to be persuaded of the truth of this equitable maxim when we consider it after this manner in abstract yet when we come to particular cases the actual consequences which happen to proceed from any action have a very great effect upon our  entiments concerning its merit or demerit  nd almost always either enhance or diminish  our sense of both Scarce in any one instance perhaps will our sentiments be found after examination to be entirely regulated by this rule which we all acknowledge ought entirely to regulate them  This irregularity of sentiment which every body feels which scarce any body is sufficiently aware of and which no body is willing to acknowledge I proceed now to explain and I shall consider first the cause which gives occasion to it or the mechanism by which nature produces it secondly the extent of its influence and last of all the end which it answers or the purpose which the author of nature seems to have intended by it  CHAP I Of the causes of this influence of fortune  THE causes of pain and pleasure whatever they are or however they operate seem to be the objects which in all animals immediately excite those two passions of gratitude and  resentment They are excited by inanimated as well as by animated objects We are angry for a moment even at the stone that hurts us A child beats it a dog barks at it a choleric man is apt to curse it The least reflection indeed corrects this sentiment and we soon become sensible that what has no feeling is a very improper object of revenge When the mischief however is very great the object which caused it becomes disagreeable to us ever after and we take pleasure to burn or destroy it We should treat in this manner the instrument which had accidentally been the cause of the death of a friend and we should often think ourselves guilty of a sort of inhumanity if we neglected to vent this absurd sort of vengeance upon it  We conceive in the same manner a sort of gratitude for those inanimated objects which have been the causes of great or frequent pleasure to us The sailor who as soon as he got ashore should mend his fire with the plank upon which he had just escaped from a shipwreck would seem to be guilty of an unnatural action We should expect that he would  rather preserve it with care and affection as a monument that was in some measure dear to him A man grows fond of a snuffbox of a penknife of a staff which he has long made use of and conceives something like a real love and affection for them If he breaks or loses them he is vexed out of all proportion to the value of the damage The house which we have long lived in the tree whose verdure and shade we have long enjoyed are both looked upon with a sort of respect that seems due to such benefactors The decay of the one or the ruin of the other affects us with a kind of melancholy though we should sustain no loss by it The Dryads and the Lares of the ancients a sort of genii of trees and houses were probably first suggested by this sort of affection which the authors of those superstitions felt for such objects and which seemed unreasonable if there was nothing animated about them  But before any thing can be the proper object of gratitude or resentment it must not only be the cause of pleasure or pain it must likewise be capable of feeling them Without this other quality those passions  cannot vent themselves with any sort of satisfaction upon it As they are excited by the causes of pleasure and pain so their gratification consists in retaliating those sensations upon what gave occasion to them which it is to no purpose to attempt upon what has no sensibility Animals therefore are less improper objects of gratitude and resentment than inanimated objects The dog that bites the ox that gores are both of them punished If they have been the causes of the death of any person neither the public nor the relations of the slain can be satisfied unless they are put to death in their turn nor is this merely for the security of the living but in some measure to revenge the injury of the dead Those animals on the contrary that have been remarkably serviceable to their masters become the objects of a very lively gratitude We are shocked at the brutality of that officer mentioned in the Turkish Spy who stabbed he horse that had carried him across an arm of the sea lest that animal should afterwards distinguish some other person by a similar adventure  But though animals are not only the causes of pleasure and pain but are also capable of feeling those sensations they are  still far from being compleat and perfect objects either of gratitude or resentment and those passions still feel that there is something wanting to their entire gratification What gratitude chiefly desires is not only to make the benefactor feel pleasure in his turn but to make him conscious that he meets with this reward on account of his past conduct to make him pleased with that conduct and to satisfy him that the person upon whom he bestowed his good offices was not unworthy of them What most of all charms us in our benefactor is the concord between his sentiments and our own with regard to what interests us so nearly as the worth of our own character and the esteem that is due to us We are delighted to find a person who values us as we value ourselves and distinguishes us from the rest of mankind with an attention not unlike that with which we distinguish ourselves To maintain in him these agreeable and flattering sentiments is one of the chief ends proposed by the returns we are disposed to make to him A generous mind often disdains the interested thought of extorting new favours from its benefactor by what  may be called the importunities of its gratitude But to preserve and to increase his esteem is an interest which the greatest mind does not think unworthy of its attention And this is the foundation of what I formerly observed that when we cannot enter into the motives of our benefactor when his conduct and character appear unworthy of our approbation let his services have been ever so great our gratitude is always sensibly diminished We are less flattered by the distinction and to preserve the esteem of so weak or so worthless a patron seems to be an object which does not deserve to be pursued for its own sake  The object on the contrary which resentment is chiefly intent upon is not so much to make our enemy feel pain in his turn as to make him conscious that he feels it upon account of his past conduct to make him repent of that conduct and to make him sensible that the person whom he injured did not deserve to be treated in that manner What chiefly enrages us against the man who injures or insults us is the little account which he seems to make of us the unreasonable preference which  he gives to himself above us and that absurd selflove by which he seems to imagine that other people may be sacrificed at any time to his conveniency or his humour The glaring impropriety of this conduct the gross insolence and injustice which it seems to involve in it often shock and exasperate us more than all the mischief which we have suffered To bring him back to a more just sense of what is due to other people to make him sensible of what he owes us and of the wrong that he has done to us is frequently the principal end proposed in our revenge which is always imperfect when it cannot accomplish this When our enemy appears to have done us no injury when we are sensible that he acted quite properly that in his situation we should have done the same thing and that we deserved from him all the mischief we met with in that case if we have the least spark either of candour or justice we can entertain no sort of resentment  Before any thing therefore can be the compleat and proper object either of gratitude or resentment it must possess three different qualifications First it must be the cause of pleasure in the one case  and of pain in the other Secondly it must be capable of feeling those sensations And thirdly it must not only have produced those sensations but it must have produced them from design and from a design that is approved or in the one case and disapproved of in the other It is by the first qualification that any object is capable of exciting those passions it is by the second that it is in any respect capable of gratifying them the third qualification is both necessary for their compleat satisfaction and as it gives a pleasure or pain that is both exquisite and peculiar it is likewise an additional exciting cause of those passions  As what gives pleasure or pain therefore either in one way or another is the sole exciting cause of gratitude and resentment though the intentions of any person should be ever so proper and beneficent on the one hand or ever so improper and malevolent on the other yet if he has failed in producing either the good or the evil which he intended as one of the exciting causes is wanting in both cases less gratitude seems due to him in the one and less resentment in the other And on the contrary though in the intentions of any  person there was either no laudable degree of benevolence on the one hand or no blameable degree of malice on the other yet if his actions should produce either great good or great evil as one of the exciting causes takes place upon both these occasions some gratitude is apt to arise towards him in the one and some resentment in the other A shadow of merit seems to fall upon him in the first a shadow of demerit in the second And as the consequences of actions are altogether under the empire of fortune hence arises her influence upon the sentiments of mankind with regard to merit and demerit  CHAP II Of the extent of this influence of fortune  THE effect of this influence of fortune is first to diminish our sense of the merit or demerit of those actions which arose from the most laudable or blameable intentions when they fail of producing their proposed effects and secondly to increase our sense of the merit  or demerit of actions beyond what is due to the motives or affections from which they proceed when they accidentally give occasion either to extraordinary pleasure or pain  I First I say though the intentions of any person should be ever so proper and beneficent on the one hand or ever so improper and malevolent on the other yet if they fail in producing their effects his merit seems imperfect in the one case and his demerit incompleat in the other Nor is this irregularity of sentiment felt only by those who are immediately affected by the consequence of any action It is felt in some measure even by the impartial spectator The man who solicits an office for another without obtaining it is regarded as his friend and seems to deserve his love and affection But the man who not only solicits but procures it is more peculiarly considered as his patron and benefactor and as intitled to his respect and gratitude The person obliged we are apt to think may with some justice imagine himself on a level with the first but we cannot enter in his sentiments if he does not feel himself inferior  to the second It is common indeed to say that we are equally obliged to the man who has endeavoured to serve us as to him who actually did so It is the speech which we constantly make upon every unsuccessful attempt of this kind but which like all other fine speeches must be understood with a grain of allowance The sentiments which a man of generosity entertains for the friend who fails may often indeed be nearly the same with those which he conceives for him who succeeds and the more generous he is the more nearly will those sentiments approach to an exact level With the truly generous to be beloved to be esteemed by those whom they themselves think worthy of esteem gives more pleasure and thereby excites more gratitude than all the advantages which they can ever expect from those sentiments When they lose those advantages therefore they seem to lose but a trifle which is scarce worth regarding They still however lose something Their pleasure therefore and consequently their gratitude is not perfectly compleat and accordingly if between the friend who fails and the friend who succeeds all other circumstances are equal  there will even in the noblest and the best mind be some little difference of affection in favour of him who succeeds Nay so unjust are mankind in this respect that though the intended benefit should be procured yet if it is not procured by the means of a particular benefactor they are apt to think that less gratitude is due to the man who with the best intentions in the world could do no more than help it a little forward As their gratitude is in this case divided among the different persons who contributed to their pleasure a smaller share of it seems due to any one Such a person we hear men commonly say intended no doubt to serve us and we really believe exerted himself to the utmost of his abilities for that purpose We are not however obliged to him for this benefit since had it not been for the concurrence of others all that he could have done would never have brought it about This consideration they imagine should even in the eyes of the impartial spectator diminish the debt which they owe to him The person himself who has unsuccessfully endeavoured to confer a benefit has by no means the same dependency upon  the gratitude of the man whom he meant to oblige nor the same sense of his own merit towards him which he would have had in the case of success  Even the merit of talents and abilities which some accident has hindered from producing their effects seems in some measure imperfect even to those who are fully convinced of their capacity to produce them The general who has been hindered by the envy of ministers from gaining some great advantage over the enemies of his country regrets the loss of the opportunity for ever after Nor is it only upon account of the public that he regrets it He laments that he was hindered from performing an action which would have added a new lustre to his character in his own eyes as well as in those of every other person It satisfies neither himself nor others to reflect that the plan or design was all that depended on him that no greater capacity was required to execute it than what was necessary to concert it that he was allowed to be every way capable of executing it and that had he been permitted to go on success was infallible He still did not execute it and  though he might deserve all the approbation which is due to a magnanimous and great design he still wanted the actual merit of having performed a great action To take the management of any affair of public concern from the man who has almost brought it to a conclusion is regarded as the most invidious injustice As he had done so much he should we think have been allowed to acquire the compleat merit of putting an end to it It was objected to Pompey that he came in upon the victories of Lucullus and gathered those laurels which were due to the fortune and valour of another The glory of Lucullus it seems was less compleat even in the opinion of his own friends when he was not permitted to finish that conquest which his conduct and courage had put in the power of almost any man to finish It mortifies an architect when his plans are either not executed at all or when they are so far altered as to spoil the effect of the building The plan however is all that depends upon the architect The whole of his genius is to good judges as compleatly discovered in that as in the actual execution But a plan does not even  to the most intelligent give the same pleasure as a noble and magnificent building They may discover as much both of taste and genius in the one as in the other But their effects are still vastly different and the amusement derived from the first never approaches to the wonder and admiration which are sometimes excited by the second We may believe of many men that their talents are superior to those of Caesar and Alexander and that in the same situations they would perform still greater actions In the mean time however we do not behold them with that astonishment and admiration with which those two heroes have been regarded in all ages and nations The calm judgments of the mind may approve of them more but they want the splendor of great actions to dazzle and transport it The superiority of virtues and talents have not even upon those who acknowledge that superiority the same effect with the superiority of atchievements  As the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to do good seems thus in the eyes of ungrateful mankind to be diminished by the miscarriage so does likewise the demerit of an unsuccessful attempt to do evil The  design to commit a crime how clearly soever it may be proved is scarce ever punished with the same severity as the actual commission of it The case of treason is perhaps the only exception That crime immediately affecting the being of the government itself the government is naturally more jealous of it than of any other In the punishment of treason the sovereign resents the injuries which are immediately done to himself in the punishment of other crimes he resents those which are done to other men It is his own resentment which he indulges in the one case it is that of his subjects which by sympathy he enters into in the other In the first case therefore as he judges in his own cause he is very apt to be more violent and sanguinary in his punishments than the impartial spectator can approve of His resentment too rises here upon smaller occasions and does not always as in other cases wait for the perpetration of the crime or even for the attempt to commit it A treasonable concert tho' nothing has been done or even attempted in consequence of it nay a treasonable conver  ation is in many countries punished in  the same manner as the actual commission of treason With regard to all other crimes the mere design upon which no attempt has followed is seldom punished at all and is never punished severely A criminal design and a criminal action it may be said indeed do not necessarily suppose the same degree of depravity and ought not therefore to be subjected to the same punishment We are capable it may be said of resolving and even of taking measures to execute many things which when it comes to the point we feel ourselves altogether incapable of executing But this reason can have no place when the design has been carried the length of the last attempt The man however who fires a pistol at his enemy but misses him is punished with death by the laws of scarce any country By the old law of Scotland tho' he should wound him yet unless death ensues within a certain time the assassine is not liable to the last punishment The resentment of mankind however runs so high against thi  crime their terror for the man who show himself capable of committing it is s  great that the mere attempt to commit i  ought in all countries to be capital The attempt to commit smaller crimes is almost always punished very lightly and sometimes is not punished at all The thief whose hand has been caught in his neighbour's pocket before he had taken any thing out of it is punished with ignominy only If he had got time to take away an handkerchief he would have been put to death The housebreaker who has been found setting a ladder to his neighbour's window but had not got into it is not exposed to the capital punishment The attempt to ravish is not punished as a rape The attempt to seduce a married woman is not punished at all tho' seduction is punished severely Our resentment against the person who only attempted to do a mischief is seldom so strong as to bear us out in inflicting the same punishment upon him which we should have thought due if he had actually done it In the one case the joy of our deliverance alleviates our sense of the atrocity of his conduct in the other the grief for our misfortune increases it His real demerit however is undoubtedly the same in both cases since his intentions were equally criminal and  there is in this respect therefore an irregularity in the sentiments of all men and a consequent relaxation of discipline in the laws of I believe all nations of the most civilized as well as of the most barbarous The humanity of a civilized people disposes them either to dispense with or to mitigate punishments wherever their natural indignation is not goaded on by the consequences of the crime Barbarians on the other hand when no actual consequence has happened from any action are not apt to be very delicate or inquisitive about the motives  The person himself who either from passion or from the influence of bad company has resolved and perhaps taken measures to perpetrate some crime but who has fortunately been prevented by an accident which put it out of his power is sure if he has any remains of conscience to regard this event all his life after as a great and signal deliverance He can never think of it without returning thanks to Heaven for having been thus graciously pleased to save him from the guilt into which he was just ready to plunge himself and to hinder him from rendering all the rest of his life a  s  ene of horror remorse and repentance But tho' his hands are innocent he is conscious that his heart is equally guilty as if he had actually executed what he was so fully resolved upon It gives great ease to his conscience however to consider that the crime was not executed tho' he knows that the failure arose from no virtue in him He still considers himself as less deserving of punishment and resentment and this good fortune either diminishes or takes away altogether all sense of guilt To remember how much he was resolved upon it has no other effect than to make him regard his escape as the greater and more miraculous for he still fancies that he has escaped and he looks back upon the danger to which his peace of mind was exposed with that terror with which one who is in safety may sometimes remember the hazard he was in of falling over a precipice and shudder with horror at the thought  The second effect of this influence of fortune is to increase our sense of the merit or demerit of actions beyond what is due to the motives or affection from which  hey proceed when they happen to give  occasion to extraordinary pleasure or pain The agreeable or disagreeable effects of the action often throw a shadow of merit or demerit upon the agent tho' in his intention there was nothing that deserved either praise or blame or at least that deserved them in the degree in which we are apt to bestow them Thus even the messenger of bad news is disagreeable to us and on the contrary we feel a sort of gratitude for the man who brings us good tidings For a moment we look upon them both as the authors the one of our good the other of our bad fortune and regard them in some measure as if they had really brought about the events which they only give an account of The first author of our joy is naturally the object of a transitory gratitude we embrace him with warmth and affection and should be glad during the instant of our prosperity to reward him as for some signal service By the custom of all courts the officer who brings the news of a victory is intitled to considerable preferments and the general always chuses one of his principal favourites to go upon so agreeable an errand The first author of our sorrow is on the contrary just as naturally  the object of a transitory resentment We can scarce avoid looking upon him with chagrine and uneasiness and the rude and brutal are apt to vent upon him that spleen which his intelligence gives occasion to Tigranes King of Armenia struck off the head of the man who brought him the first account of the approach of a formidable enemy To punish in this manner the author of bad tidings seems barbarous and inhuman yet to reward the messenger of good news is not disagreeable to us we think it suitable to the bounty of kings But why do we make this difference since if there is no fault in the one neither is there any merit in the other It is because any sort of reason seems sufficient to authorize the exertion of the social and benevolent affections but it requires the most solid and substantial to make us enter into that of the unsocial and malevolent  But tho' in general we are averse to enter into the unsocial and malevolent affections tho' we lay it down for a rule that we ought never to approve of their gratification unless so far as the malicious and unjust intention of the person against whom  they are directed renders him their proper object yet upon some occasions we relax of this severity When the negligence of one man has occasioned some unintended damage to another we generally enter so far into the resentment of the sufferer as to approve of his inflicting a punishment upon the offender much beyond what the offence would have appeared to deserve had no such unlucky consequence followed from it  There is a degree of negligence which would appear to deserve some chastisement tho' it should occasion no damage to any body Thus if a person should throw a large stone over a wall into a public street without giving warning to those who might be passing by and without regarding where it was likely to fall he would undoubtedly deserve some chastisement A very accurate police would punish so absurd an action even tho' it had done no mischief The person who has been guilty of it shows an insolent contempt of the happiness and safety of others There is real injustice in his conduct He wantonly exposes his neighbour to what no man in his senses would chuse to expose himself  and evidently wants that sense of what is due to his fellow creatures which is the basis of justice and of society Gross negligence therefore is in the law said to be almost equal to malicious design  Lata culpa prope dolum est  When any unlucky consequences happen from such carelessness the person who has been guilty of it is often punished as if he had really intended those consequences and his conduct which was only thoughtless and insolent and what deserved some chastisement is considered as atrocious and as liable to the severest punishment Thus if by the imprudent action above mentioned he should accidentally kill a man he is by the laws of many countries particularly by the old law of Scotland liable to the last punishment And tho' this is no doubt excessively severe it is not altogether inconsistent with our natural sentiments Our just indignation against the folly and inhumanity of his conduct is exasperated by our sympathy with the unfortunate sufferer Nothing however would appear more shocking to our natural sense of equity than to bring a man to the scaffold merely for having  thrown a stone carelessly into the street without hurting any body The folly and inhumanity of his conduct however would in this case be the same but still our sentiments would be very different The consideration of this difference may satisfy us how much the indignation even of the spectator is apt to be animated by the actual consequences of the action In cases of this kind there will if I am not mistaken be found a great degree of severity in the laws of almost all nations as I have already observed that in those of an opposite kind there was a very general relaxation of discipline  There is another degree of negligence which does not involve in it any sort of injustice The person who is guilty of it treats his neighbour as he treats himself means no harm to any body and is far from entertaining any insolent contempt for the safety and happiness of others He is not however so careful and circumspect in his conduct as he ought to be and deserves upon this account some degree of blame and censure but no sort of punishment Yet if by a negligence  Culpa levis  of this kind  he should occasion some damage to another person he is by the laws of I believe all countries obliged to compensate it And though this is no doubt a real punishment and what no mortal would have thought of inflicting upon him had it not been for the unlucky accident which his conduct gave occasion to yet this decision of the law is approved of by the natural sentiments of all mankind Nothing we think can be more just than that one man should not suffer by the carelessness of another and that the damage occasioned by blameable negligence should be made up by the person who was guilty of it  There is another species of negligence  Culpa levissima  which consists merely in a want of the most anxious timidity and circumspection with regard to all the possible consequences of our actions The want of this painful attention when no bad consequences follow from it is so far from being regarded as blameable that the contrary quality is rather considered as such That timid circumspection which is afraid of every thing is never regarded as a virtue but as a quality which more than any other incapacitates  for action and business Yet when from a want of this excessive care a person happens to occasion some damage to another he is often by the law obliged to compensate it Thus by the Aquilian law the man who not being able to manage a horse that had accidentally taken fright should happen to ride down his neighbour's slave is obliged to compensate the damage When an accident of this kind happens we are apt to think that he ought not to have rode such a horse and to regard his attempting it as an unpardonable levity though without this accident we should not only have made no such reflection but should have regarded his refusing it as the effect of timid weakness and of an anxiety about merely possible effects which it is to no purpose to be aware of The person himself who by an accident even of this kind has involuntarily hurt another seems to have some sense of his own ill desert with regard to him He naturally runs up to the sufferer to express his concern for what has happened and to make every acknowledgment in his power If he has any sensibility he necessarily desires to compensate the damage and to do every  thing he can to appease that animal resentment which he is sensible will be apt to arise in the breast of the sufferer To make no apology to offer no atonement is regarded as the highest brutality Yet why should he make an apology more than any other person Why should he since he was equally innocent with any other bystander be thus singled out from among all mankind to make up for the bad fortune of another This task would surely never be imposed upon him did not even the impartial spectator feel some indulgence for what may be regarded as the unjust resentment of that other  CHAP III Of the final cause of this irregularity of sentiments  SUCH is the effect of the good or bad consequences of actions upon the sentiments both of the person who performs them and of others and thus fortune which governs the world has some influence where we should be least willing to allow her any and directs in some measure  the sentiments of mankind with regard to the character and conduct both of themselves and others That the world judges by the event and not by the design has been in all ages the complaint and is the great discouragement of virtue Every body agrees to the general maxim that as the event does not depend on the agent it ought to have no influence upon our sentiments with regard to the merit or propriety of his conduct But when we come to particulars we find that our sentiments are scarce in any one instance exactly conformable to what this equitable maxim would direct The happy or unprosperous event of any action is not only apt to give us a good or bad opinion of the prudence with which it was conducted but almost always too animates our gratitude or resentment our sense of the merit or demerit of the design  Nature however when she implanted the seeds of this irregularity in the human breast seems as upon all other occasions to have intended the happiness and perfection of the species If the hurtfulness of the design if the malevolence of the affection were alone the causes which excited  our resentment we should feel all the furies of that passion against any person in whose breast we suspected or believed such designs or affections were haboured though they had never broke out into any action Sentiments thoughts intentions would become the objects of punishment and if the indignation of mankind run as high against them as against actions if the baseness of the thought which had given birth to no action seemed in the eyes of the world as much to call aloud for vengeance as the baseness of the action every court of judicature would become a real inquisition There would be no safety for the most innocent and circumspect conduct Bad wishes bad views bad designs might still be suspected and while these excited the same indignation with bad conduct while bad intentions were as much resented as bad actions they would equally expose the person to punishment and resentment Actions therefore which either produce actual evil or attempt to produce it and thereby put us in the immediate fear of it are by the author of nature rendered the only proper and approved objects of human punishment  and resentment Sentiments designs affections though it is from these that according to cool reason human actions derive their whole merit or demerit are placed by the great Judge of hearts beyond the limits of every human jurisdiction and are reserved for the cognizance of his own unerring tribunal That necessary rule of justice therefore that men in this life are liable to punishment for their actions only not for their designs and intentions is founded upon this salutary and useful irregularity in human sentiments concerning merit or demerit which at first sight appears so absurd and unaccountable But every part of nature when attentively surveyed equally demonstrates the providential care of its author and we may admire the wisdom and goodness of God even in the weakness and folly of men  Nor is that irregularity of sentiments altogether without its utility by which the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to serve and much more that of meer good inclinations and kind wishes appears to be imperfect Man was made for action and to promote by the exertion of his faculties such changes in the external circumstances  both of himself and others as may seem most favourable to the happiness of all He must not be satisfied with indolent benevolence nor fancy himself the friend of mankind because in his heart he wishes well to the prosperity of the world That he may call forth the whole vigour of his soul and strain every nerve in order to produce those ends which it is the purpose of his being to advance nature has taught him that neither himself nor mankind can be fully satisfied with his conduct nor bestow upon it the full measure of applause unless he has actually produced them He is made to know that the praise of good intentions without the merit of good offices will be but of little avail to excite either the loudest acclamations of the world or even the highest degree of self  pplause The man who has performed  o single action of importance but whose whole conversation and deportment express  he justest the noblest and most generous  entiments can be intitled to demand no  ery high reward even tho' his inutility  hould be owing to nothing but the want  f an opportunity to serve We can still  efuse it him without blame We can  still ask him What have you done What actual service can you produce to intitle you to so great a recompence We esteem you and love you but we owe you nothing To reward indeed that latent virtue which has been useless only for want of an opportunity to serve to bestow upon it those honours and preferments which tho' in some measure it may be said to deserve them it could not with propriety have insisted upon is the effect of the most divine benevolence To punish on the contrary for the affections of the heart only where no crime has been committed is the most insolent and barbarous tyranny The benevolent affections seem to deserve most praise when they do not wait till it becomes almost a crime for them not to exert themselves The malevolent on the contrary can scarce be too tardy too slow or deliberate  It is even of use that the evil which is done without design should be regarded as a misfortune to the doer as well as to the sufferer Man is thereby taught to reverence the happiness of his brethren to tremble lest he should even unknowingly do any thing that can hurt them and to  dread that animal resentment which he feels is ready to burst out against him if he should without design be the unhappy instrument of their calamity  Notwithstanding however all these seeming irregularities of sentiment if man should unfortunately either give occasion to those evils which he did not intend or fail in producing that good which he intended nature has not left his innocence altogether without consolation nor his virtue altogether without reward He then calls to his assistance that just and equitable maxim that those events which did not depend upon our conduct ought not to diminish the esteem that is due to us He summons up his whole magnanimity and firmness of soul and strives to regard himself not in the light in which he at present appears but in that in which he ought to appear in which he would have appeared had his generous designs been crowned with success and in which he would still appear notwithstanding their miscarriage  f the sentiments of mankind were either altogether candid and equitable or even perfectly consistent with themselves The more candid and humane part of mankind  intirely go along with the effort which he thus makes to support himself in his own opinion They exert their whole generosity and greatness of mind to correct in themselves this irregularity of human nature and endeavour to regard his unfortunate magnanimity in the same light in which had it been successful they would without any such generous exertion have naturally been disposed to consider it  PART III Of the foundation of our judgments concerning our own sentiments and conduct and of the sense of duty  SECT I Of the consciousness of merited praise or blame  IN the two foregoing parts of this discourse I have chiefly considered the origin and foundation of our judgments concerning the sentiments and conduct of others I come now to consider the origin of those concerning our own  The desire of the approbation and esteem of those we live with which is of so much importance to our happiness cannot be fully and intirely contented but by rendering ourselves the just and proper objects of those sentiments and by adjusting our own character and conduct according to those measures and rules by which esteem and approbation are naturally bestowed It is  not sufficient that from ignorance or mistake esteem and approbation should some way or other be bestowed upon us If we are conscious that we do not deserve to be so favourably thought of and that if the truth was known we should be regarded with very opposite sentiments our satisfaction is far from being complete The man who applauds us either for actions which we did not perform or for motives which had no sort of influence upon our conduct applauds not us but another person We can derive no sort of satisfaction from his praises To us they should be more mortifying than any censure and should perpetually call to our minds the most humbling of all reflexions the reflexion upon what we ought to be but what we are not A woman who paints to conceal her ugliness could derive one should imagine but little vanity from the compliments that are paid to her beauty These we should expect ought rather to put her in mind of the sentiments which her real complexion would excite and mortify her the more by the contrast To be pleased with such groundless applause is a proof of the most superficial levity and weakness It is what is  properly called vanity and is the foundation of the most ridiculous and contemptible vices the vices of affectation and common lying follies which if experience did not teach us how common they are one should imagine the least spark of common sense would save us from The foolish lyar who endeavours to excite the admiration of the company by the relation of adventures which never had any existence the important coxcomb who gives himself airs of rank and distinction which he well knows he has no just pretensions to are both of them no doubt pleased with the applause which they fancy they meet with But their vanity arises from so gross an illusion of the imagination that it is difficult to conceive how any rational creature should be imposed upon by it When they place themselves in the situation of those whom they fancy they have deceived they are struck with the highest admiration for their own persons They look upon themselves not in that light in which they know they ought to appear to their companions but in that in which they believe their companions actually look upon them Their superficial weakness and trivial folly hinder  them from ever turning their eyes inwards or from seeing themselves in that despicable point of view in which their own consciences should tell them that they would appear to every body if the real truth should ever come to be known  As ignorant and groundless praise can give no solid joy no satisfaction that will bear any serious examination so on the contrary it often gives real comfort to reflect that tho' no praise should actually be bestowed upon us our conduct however has been such as to deserve it and has been in every respect suitable to those measures and rules by which praise and approbation are naturally and commonly bestowed We are pleased not only with praise but with having done what is praiseworthy We are pleased to think that we have rendered ourselves the natural objects of approbation though no approbation should ever actually be bestowed upon us and we are mortified to reflect that we have justly incurred the blame of those we live with though that sentiment should never actually be exerted against us The man who is conscious to himself that he has exactly observed those measures of  conduct which experience informs him are generally agreeable reflects with satisfaction on the propriety of his own behaviour when he views it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it he thoroughly enters into all the motives which influenced it he looks back upon every part of it with pleasure and approbation and tho' mankind should never be acquainted with what he has done he regards himself not so much according to the light in which they actually regard him as according to that in which they would regard him if they were better informed He anticipates the applause and admiration which in this case would be bestowed upon him and he applauds and admires himself by sympathy with sentiments which do not indeed actually take place but which the ignorance of the public alone hinders from taking place which he knows are the natural and ordinary effects of such conduct which his imagination strongly connects with it and which he has acquired a habit of conceiving as something that naturally and in propriety ought to flow from it Men have often voluntarily thrown away life to acquire after  death a renown which they could no longer enjoy Their imagination in the mean time anticipated that fame which was thereafter to be bestowed upon them Those applauses which they were never to hear rung in their ears The thoughts of that admiration whose effects they were never to feel played about their hearts banished from their breasts the strongest of all natural fears and transported them to perform actions which seem almost beyond the reach of human nature But in point of reality there is surely no great difference between that approbation which is not to be bestowed till we can no longer enjoy it and that which indeed is never to be bestowed but which would be bestowed if the world was ever made to understand properly the real circumstances of our behaviour If the one often produces such violent effects we cannot wonder that the other should always be highly regarded  On the contrary the man who has broke thro' all those measures of conduct which can alone render him agreeable to mankind tho' he should have the most perfect assurance that what he had done was forever to be concealed from every human eye  it is all to no purpose When he looks back upon it and views it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it he finds that he can enter into none of the motives which influenced it He is abashed and confounded at the thoughts of it and necessarily feels a very high degree of that shame which he would be exposed to if his actions should ever come to be generally known His imagination in this case too anticipates the contempt and derision from which nothing saves him but the ignorance of those he lives with He still feels that he is the natural object of these sentiments and still trembles at the thought of what he would suffer if they were ever actually exerted against him But if what he had been guilty of was not meerly one of those improprieties which are the objects of simple disapprobation but one of those enormous crimes which excite detestation and resentment he could never think of it as long as he had any sensibility left without feeling all the agony of horror and remorse and tho' he could be assured that no man was ever to know it and could even bring himself to believe that there was no God to  revenge it he would still feel enough of both these sentiments to embitter the whole of his life He would still regard himself as the natural object of the hatred and indignation of all his fellowcreatures and if his heart was not grown callous by the habit of crimes he could not think without terror and astonishment even of the manner in which mankind would look upon him of what would be the expression of their countenance and of their eyes if the dreadful truth should ever come to be known These natural pangs of an afrighted conscience are the daemons the avenging furies which in this life haunt the guilty which allow them neither quiet nor repose which often drive them to despair and distraction from which no assurance of secrecy can protect them from which no principles of irreligion can entirely deliver them and from which nothing can free them but the vilest and most abject of all states a compleat insensibility to honour and infamy to vice and virtue Men of the most detestable characters who in the execution of the most dreadful crimes had taken their measures so coolly as to avoid even the suspicion of guilt have sometimes been driven  by the horror of their situation to discover of their own accord what no human sagacity could ever have investigated By acknowledging their guilt by submitting themselves to the resentment of their offended citizens and by thus satiating that vengeance of which they were sensible that they were become the proper objects they hoped by their death to reconcile themselves at least in their own imagination to the natural sentiments of mankind to be able to consider themselves as less worthy of hatred and resentment to attone in some measure for their crimes and if possible to die in peace and with the forgiveness of all their fellowcreatures Compared to what they felt before the discovery even the thought of this it seems was happiness  SECT II In what manner our own judgments refer to what ought to be the judgments of others And of the origin of general rules  A Great part perhaps the greatest part of human happiness and misery arises from the view of our past conduct and from the degree of approbation or disapprobation  which we feel from the consideration of it But in whatever manner it may affect us our sentiments of this kind have always some secret reference either to what are or to what upon a certain condition would be or to what we imagine ought to be the sentiments of others We examine it as we imagine an impartial spectator would examine it If upon placing ourselves in his situation we thoroughly enter into all the passions and motives which influenced it we approve of it by sympathy with the approbation of this supposed equitable judge If otherwise we enter into his disapprobation and condemn it  Was it possible that a human creature could grow up to manhood in some solitary place without any communication with his own species he could no more think of his own character of the propriety or demerit of his own sentiments and conduct of the beauty or deformity of his own mind than of the beauty or deformity of his own face All these are objects which he cannot easily see which naturally he does not look at and upon which he is provided with no mirror to enable him to turn his eyes Bring him into society and he is immediately  provided with the mirror which he wanted before It is placed in the countenance and behaviour of those he lives with which always mark when they enter into and when they disapprove of his sentiments and it is here that he first views the propriety and impropriety of his own passions the beauty and deformity of his own mind To a man who from his birth was a stranger to society the objects of his passions the external bodies which either pleased or hurt him would occupy his whole attention The passions themselves the desires or aversions the joys or sorrows which those objects excited tho' of all things the most immediately present to him could scarce ever be the objects of his thoughts The idea of them could never interest him so much as to call upon his attentive consideration The consideration of his  oy could in him excite no new joy nor that of his sorrow any new sorrow tho' the consideration of the causes of those passions might often excite both Bring him into society and all his own passions will immediately become the causes of new passions He will observe that mankind ap  rove of some of them and are disgusted  by others He will be elevated in the one case and cast down in the other his desires and aversions his joys and sorrows will now often become the causes of new desires and new aversions new joys and new sorrows they will now therefore interest him deeply and often call upon his most attentive consideration  To be amiable and to be meritorious that is to deserve love and to deserve reward are the great characters of virtue and the contrary of vice But both these characters have an immediate reference to the sentiments of others Virtue is not said to be amiable or to be meritorious because it is the object of its own love or of its own gratitude but because it excites those sentiments in other men The consciousness that it is the object of such favourable regards is the source of that inward tranquillity and selfsatisfaction with which it is naturally attended as the suspicion of the contrary gives occasion to the torments of vice What so great happiness as to be beloved and to know that we deserve to be beloved What so great misery as to be hated and to know that we deserve to be hated  To judge or ourselves as we judge of others to approve and condemn in ourselves what we approve and condemn in others is the greatest exertion of candour and impartiality In order to do this we must look at ourselves with the same eyes with which we look at others we must imagine ourselves not the actors but the spectators of our own character and conduct and consider how these would affect us when viewed from this new station in which their excellencies and imperfections can alone be discovered We must enter in short either into what are or into what ought to be or into what if the whole circumstances of our conduct were known we imagine would be the sentiments of others before we can either applaud or condemn it  A moral being is an accountable being An accountable being as the word expresses is a being that must give an account of its actions to some other and that consequently must regulate them according to the goodliking of this other Man is accountable to God and his fellow creatures But tho' he is no doubt principally accountable to God in the order of  time he must necessarily conceive himself as accountable to his fellow creatures before he can form any idea of the Deity or of the rules by which that Divine Being will judge of his conduct A child surely conceives itself as accountable to its parents and is elevated or cast down by the thought of their merited approbation or disapprobation long before it forms any idea of its accountableness to the Deity or of the rules by which that Divine Being will judge of its conduct  Our first ideas of personal beauty and deformity are drawn from the shape and appearance of others not from our own We soon become sensible however that others exercise the same criticism upon us We are pleased when they approve of our figure and are disobliged when they seem to be disgusted We become anxious to know how far our appearance deserves either their blame or approbation We examine our own persons limb by limb and by placing ourselves before a lookingglass▪ or by some such expedient endeavour a  much as possible to view ourselves at th  distance and with the eyes of other people▪ If after this examination we are satisfie  with our own appearance we can more easily support the most disadvantageous judgments of others if on the contrary we are sensible that we are the natural objects of distaste every appearance of their disapprobation mortifies us beyond all measure A man who is tolerably handsome will allow you to laugh at any little irregularity in his person but all such jokes are commonly insupportable to one who is really deformed It is evident however that we are anxious about our own beauty and deformity only upon account of its effect upon others If we had no connection with society we should be altogether indifferent about either  In the same manner our first moral criticisms are exercised upon the characters and conduct of other people and we are all very forward to observe how each of these affects us But we soon learn that others are equally frank with regard to our own We become anxious to know how far we deserve their censure or applause and whether to them we must necessarily appear those agreeable or disagreeable creatures which they represent us We begin upon this account to examine our  own passions and conduct and to consider how these must appear to them by considering how they would appear to us if in their situation We suppose ourselves the spectators of our own behaviour and endeavour to imagine what effect it would in this light produce upon us This is the only lookingglass by which we can in some measure with the eyes of others scrutinize the propriety of our own conduct If in this view it pleases us we are tolerably satisfied We can be more indifferent about the applause and in some measure despise the censure of others secure that however misunderstood or misrepresented we are the natural and proper objects of approbation On the contrary if we are displeased with it we are often upon that very account more anxious to gain their approbation and provided we have not already as they say shaken hands with infamy we are altogether distracted at the thoughts of their censure which then strikes us with double severity  Unfortunately this moral lookingglass is not always a very good one Common lookingglasses it is said are extremely  deceitful and by the glare which they throw over the face conceal from the partial eyes of the person many deformities which are obvious to every body besides But there is not in the world such a smoother of wrinkles as is every man's imagination with regard to the blemishes of his own character  There are two different occasions when we examine our own conduct and endeavour to view it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it first when we are about to act and secondly after we have acted Our views are very partial in both cases but they are most so when it is of most importance that they should be otherwise  When we are about to act the eagerness of passion will seldom allow us to consider what we are doing with the candour of an indifferent person The violent emotions which at that time agitate us discolour our views of things even when we are endeavouring to place ourselves in the situation of another and to regard the objects that interest us in the light which they will naturally appear to him The fury of our own passions constantly calls us back  to our own place where every thing appears magnified and misrepresented by selflove Of the manner in which those objects would appear to another of the view which he would take of them we can obtain if I may say so but instantaneous glimpses which vanish in a moment and which even while they last are not altogether just We cannot even for that moment divest ourselves entirely of the heat and keenness with which our peculiar situation inspires us nor consider what we are about to do with the compleat impartiality of an equitable judge The passions upon this account as father Malebranch says all justify themselves and seem reasonable and proportioned to their objects as long as we continue to feel them  When the action is over indeed and the passions which prompted it have subsided we can enter more coolly into the sentiments of the indifferent spectator What before interested us is now become almost as indifferent to us as it always was to him and we can now examine our own conduct with his candour and impartiality But our judgments now are of little importance  compared to what they were before and when they are most severely impartial can commonly produce nothing but vain regret and unavailing repentance without securing us from the like errors for the future It is seldom however that they are quite candid even in this case The opinion which we entertain of our own character depends entirely on our judgment concerning our past conduct It is so disagreeable to think ill of ourselves that we often purposely turn away our view from those circumstances which might render that judgment unfavourable He is a bold surgeon they say whose hand does not tremble when he performs an operation upon his own person and he is often equally bold who does not hesitate to pull off the mysterious veil of selfdelusion which covers from his view the deformities of his own conduct Rather than see our own behaviour under so disagreeable an aspect we too often foolishly and weakly endeavour to exasperate anew those unjust passions which had formerly misled us we endeavour by artifice to awaken our old hatreds and irritate afresh our almost forgotten resentments we even  exert ourselves for this miserable purpose and thus persevere in injustice merely because we once were unjust and because we are ashamed and afraid to see that we were so  So partial are the views of mankind with regard to the propriety of their own conduct both at the time of action and after it and so difficult is it for them to view it in the light in which any indifferent spectator would consider it But if it was by a peculiar faculty such as the moral sense is supposed to be that they judged of their own conduct if they were endued with a particular power of perception which distinguished the beauty or deformity of passions and affections as their own passions would be more immediately exposed to the view of this faculty it would judge with more accuracy concerning them than concerning those of other men of which it had only a more distant prospect  This selfdeceit this fatal weakness of mankind is the source of half the disorders of human life If we saw ourselves in the light in which others see us or in which they would see us if they knew all  a reformation would generally be unavoidable We could not otherwise endure the sight  Nature however has not left this weakness which is of so much importance altogether without a remedy nor has she abandoned us entirely to the delusions of selflove Our continual observations upon the conduct of others insensibly lead us to form to ourselves certain general rules concerning what is fit and proper either to be done or to be avoided Some of their actions shock all our natural sentiments We hear every body about us express the like detestation against them This still further confirms and even exasperates our natural sense of their deformity It satisfies us that we view them in the proper light when we see other people view them in the same light We resolve never to be guilty of the like nor ever upon any account to render ourselves in this manner the objects of universal disapprobation We thus naturally lay down to ourselves a general rule that all such actions are to be avoided as tending to render us odious contemptible or punishable the objects of all those sentiments for which we have  the greatest dread and aversion Other actions on the contrary call forth our approbation and we hear every body around us express the same favourable opinion concerning them Every body is eager to honour and reward them They excite all those sentiments for which we have by nature the strongest desire the love the gratitude the admiration of mankind We become ambitious of performing the like and thus naturally lay down to ourselves a rule of another kind that every opportunity of acting in this manner is carefully to be sought after  It is thus that the general rules of morality are formed They are ultimately founded upon experience of what in particular instances our moral faculties our natural sense of merit and propriety approve or disapprove of We do not originally approve or condemn particular actions because upon examination they appear to be agreeable or inconsistent with a certain general rule The general rule on the contrary is formed by finding from experience that all actions of a certain kind or circumstanced in a certain manner are approved or disapproved of To  the man who first saw an inhuman murder committed from avarice envy or unjust resentment and upon one too that loved and trusted the murderer who beheld the last agonies of the dying person who heard him with his expiring breath complain more of the perfidy and ingratitude of his false friend than of the violence which had been done to him there could be no occasion in order to conceive how horrible such an action was that he should reflect that one of the most sacred rules of conduct was what prohibited the taking away the life of an innocent person that this was a plain violation of that rule and consequently a very blameable action His detestation of this crime it is evident would arise instantaneously and antecedent to his having formed to himself any such general rule The general rule on the contrary which he might afterwards form would be founded upon the detestation which he felt necessarily arise in his own breast at the thought of this and every other particular action of the same kind  When we read in history or romance the account of actions either of generosity  or of baseness the admiration which we conceive for the one and the contempt which we feel for the other neither of them arise from reflecting that there are certain general rules which declare all actions of the one kind admirable and all actions of the other contemptible Those general rules on the contrary are all formed from the experience we have had of the effects which actions of all different kinds naturally produce upon us  An amiable action a respectable action an horrid action are all of them actions which naturally excite the love the respect or the horror of the spectator for the person who performs them The general rules which determine what actions are and what are not the objects of each of those sentiments can be formed no other way than by observing what actions actually and in fact excite them  When these general rules indeed have been formed when they are universally acknowleged and established by the concurring sentiments of mankind we frequently appeal to them as to the standards of judgment in debating concerning the degree  of praise or blame that is due to certain actions of a complicated and dubious nature They are upon these occasions commonly cited as the ultimate foundations of what is just and unjust in human conduct and this circumstance seems to have misled several very eminent authors to draw up their systems in such a manner as if they had supposed that the original judgments of mankind with regard to right and wrong were formed like the decisions of a court of judicatory by considering first the general rule and then secondly whether the particular action under consideration fell properly within its comprehension  Those general rules of conduct when they have been fixed in our mind by habitual reflection are of great use in correcting the misrepresentations of selflove concerning what is fit and proper to be done in our particular situation The man of furious resentment if he was to listen to the dictates of that passion would perhaps regard the death of his enemy as but a small compensation for the wrong he imagines he has received which however may be no more than a very slight provocation  But his observations upon the conduct of others have taught him how horrible all such sanguinary revenges appear Unless his education has been very singular he has laid it down to himself as an inviolable rule to abstain from them upon all occasions This rule preserves its authority with him and renders him incapable of being guilty of such a violence Yet the fury of his own temper may be such that had this been the first time in which he considered such an action he would undoubtedly have determined it to be quite just and proper and what every impartial spectator would approve of But that reverence for the rule which past experience has impressed upon him checks the impetuosity of his passion and helps him to correct the too partial views which selflove might otherwise suggest of what was proper to be done in his situation If he should allow himself to be so far transported by passion as to violate this rule yet even in this case he cannot throw of altogether the awe and respect with which he has been accustomed to regard it  the very time of acting at the moment i  which passion mounts the highest he hesitates  and trembles at the thought of what he is about to do he is secretly conscious to himself that he is breaking thro' those measures of conduct which in all his cool hours he had resolved never to infringe which he had never seen infringed by others without the highest disapprobation and of which the infringement his own mind forbodes must soon render him the object of the same disagreeable sentiments Before he can take the last fatal resolution he is tormented with all the agonies of doubt and uncertainty he is terrified at the thought of violating so sacred a rule and at the same time is urged and goaded on by the fury of his desires to violate it He changes his purpose every moment sometimes he resolves to adhere to his principle and not indulge a passion which may corrupt the remaining part of his life with the horrors of shame and repentance and a momentary calm takes possession of his breast from the prospect of that security and tranquillity which he will enjoy when he thus determines not to expose himself to the hazard of a contrary conduct But immediately the passion rouses anew and with fresh fury drives him on to commit  what he had the instant before resolved to abstain from Wearied and distracted with those continual irresolutions he at length from a sort of despair makes the last fatal and irrecoverable step but with that terror and amazement with which one flying from an enemy throws himself over a precipice where he is sure of meeting with more certain destruction than from any thing that pursues him from behind Such are his sentiments even at the time of acting tho' he is then no doubt less sensible of the impropriety of his own conduct than afterwards when his passion being gratified and palled he begins to view what he has done in the light in which others are apt to view it and actually feels what he had only foreseen very imperfectly before the stings of remorse and repentance begin to agitate and torment him  SECT III Of the influence and authority of the general rules of morality and that they are justly regarded as the laws of the Deity  THE regard to those general rules of conduct is what is properly called a sense of duty a principle of the greatest consequence in human life and the only principle by which the bulk of mankind  re capable of directing their actions Many men behave very decently and thro'  he whole of their lives avoid any consi  erable degree of blame who yet per  aps never felt the sentiment upon the  ropriety of which we found our appro  ation of their conduct but acted merely  rom a regard to what they saw were the  stablished rules of behaviour The man  ho has received great benefits from ano  her person may by the natural coldness  f his temper feel but a very small degree  f the sentiment of gratitude If he has  been virtuously educated however he will often have been made to observe how odious those actions appear which denote a want of this sentiment and how amiable the contrary Tho' his heart therefore is not warmed with any grateful affection he will strive to act as if it was and will endeavour to pay all those regards and attentions to his patron which the liveliest gratitude could suggest He will visit him regularly he will behave to him respectfully he will never talk of him but with expressions of the highest esteem and of the many obligations which he owes to him And what is more he will chearfully embrace every opportunity of making a proper return for past services He may do all this too without any hypocrisy or blameable dissimulation without any selfish intention of obtaining new favours and without any design of imposing either upon his benefactor or the public The motive of his actions may be no other tha  a reverence for the established rule of duty a serious and earnest desire of acting i  every respect according to the law of gra  titude A wife in the same manner ma  sometimes not feel that tender regard  her husband which is suitable to the relation that subsists between them If she has been virtuously educated however she will endeavour to act as if she felt it to be careful officious faithful▪ and sincere and to be deficient in none of those attentions which the sentiment of conjugal affection could have prompted her to perform Such a friend and such a wife are neither of them undoubtedly the very best of their kinds and tho' both of them may have the most serious and earnest desire to fulfil every part of their duty yet they will fail  n many nice and delicate regards they will miss many opportunities of obliging which they could never have overlooked if  hey had possessed the sentiment that is pro  er to their situation Tho' not the very first of their kinds however they are perhaps the second and if the regard to the general rules of conduct has been very  trongly impressed upon them neither of  hem will fail in any very essential part of  heir duty None but those of the hap  iest mold are capable of suiting with  xact justness their sentiments and beha  iour to the smallest difference of situation  nd of acting upon all occasions with the  most delicate and accurate propriety The coarse clay of which the bulk of mankind are formed cannot be wrought up to such perfection There is scarce any man however who by discipline education and example may not be so impressed with a regard to general rules as to act upon almost every occasion with tolerable decency and thro' the whole of his life avoid any considerable degree of blame  Without this sacred regard to general rules there is no man whose conduct can be much depended upon It is this which constitutes the most essential difference between a man of principle and honour and a worthless fellow The one adheres upon all occasions steadily and resolutely to his maxims and preserves thro' the whole of his life one even tenor of conduct The other acts variously and accidentally as humour inclination or interest chance to be uppermost Nay such are the inequalities of humour to which all men ar  subject that without this principle th  man who in all his cool hours had th  most delicate sensibility to the propriety o  conduct might often be led to act ab  surdly  upon the most frivolous occasions and when it was scarce possible to assign any serious motive for his behaving in this manner Your friend makes you a visit when you happen to be in a humour which makes it disagreeable to receive him in your present mood his civility is very apt to appear an impertinent intrusion and if you was to give way to the views of things which at this time occur tho' civil in your temper you would behave to him with coldness and contempt What renders you incapable of such a rudeness is nothing but a regard to the general rules of civility and hospitality which prohibit it That habitual reverence which your former experience has taught you for these enables you to act upon all such occasions with nearly equal propriety and hinders those inequalities of temper to which all men are subject from influencing your conduct in any very sensible degree But if without regard to these general rules even the duties of politeness which are so easily observed and which one can scarce have any serious motive to violate would yet be so frequently violated what would become of the duties of justice of truth  of chastity of fidelity which it is often so difficult to observe and which there may be so many strong motives to violate But upon the tolerable observance of these duties depends the very existence of human society which would crumble into nothing if mankind were not generally impressed with a reverence for those important rules of conduct  This reverence is still further enhanced by an opinion which is first impressed by nature and afterwards confirmed by reasoning and philosophy that those important rules of morality are the commands and laws of the Deity who will finally reward the obedient and punish the transgressors of their duty  This opinion or apprehension I say seems first to be impressed by nature Men are naturally led to ascribe to those mysterious beings whatever they are which happen in any country to be the object of religious fear all their own sentiments and passions They have no other they can conceive no other to ascribe to them Those unknown intelligences which they imagine but see not must necessarily be formed with some sort of resemblance to  those intelligences of which they have experience During the ignorance and darkness of pagan superstition mankind seem to have formed the ideas of their divinities with so little delicacy that they ascribed to them indiscriminately all the passions of human nature those not excepted which do the least honour to our species such as lust hunger avarice envy revenge They could not fail therefore to ascribe to those beings for the excellence of whose nature they still conceived the highest admiration those sentiments and qualities which are the great ornaments of humanity and which seem to raise it to a resemblance to divine perfection the love of virtue and beneficence and the abhorrence of vice and injustice The man who was injured called upon Jupiter to be witness of the wrong that was done to him and could not doubt but that divine being would behold it with the same indignation which would animate the meanest of mankind who looked on when injustice was committed The man who did the injury felt himself to be the proper object of the detestation and resentment of mankind and his natural fears led  him to impute the same sentiments to those awful beings whose presence he could not avoid and whose power he could not resist These natural hopes and fears and suspicions were propagated by sympathy and confirmed by education and the Gods were universally represented and believed to be the rewarders of humanity and mercy and the avengers of perfidy and injustice And thus religion even in its rudest form gave a sanction to the rules of morality long before the age of artificial reasoning and philosophy That the terrors of religion should thus enforce the natural sense of duty was of too much importance to the happiness of mankind for nature to leave it dependent upon the slowness and uncertainty of philosophical researches  These researches however when they came to take place confirmed those original anticipations of nature Upon whatever we suppose that our moral faculties are founded whether upon a certain modification of reason upon an original instinct called a moral sense or upon some other principle of our nature it cannot  be doubted that they were given us for the direction of our conduct in this life They carry along with them the most evident badges of this authority which denote that they were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our actions to superintend all our senses passions and appetites and to judge how far each of them was either to be indulged or restrained Our moral faculties are by no means as some have pretended upon a level in this respect with the other faculties and appetites of our nature endowed with no more right to restrain these last than these last are to restrain them No other faculty or principle of action judges of any other Love does not judge of resentment nor resentment of love Those two passions may be opposite to one another but cannot with any propriety be said to approve or disapprove of one another But it is the peculiar office of those faculties now under our consideration to judge to bestow censure or applause upon all the other principles of our nature They may be considered as a sort of senses of which those principles are the objects Every sense is supreme over its own objects  There is no appeal from the eye with regard to the beauty of colours nor from the ear with regard to the harmony of sounds nor from the taste with regard to the agreeableness of flavours Each of those senses judges in the last resort of its own objects Whatever gratifies the taste is sweet whatever pleases the eye is beautiful whatever sooths the ear is harmonious The very essence of each of those qualities consists in its being fitted to please the sense to which it is addressed It belongs to our moral faculties in the same manner to determine when the ear ought to be soothed when the eye ought to be indulged when the taste ought to be gratified when and how far every other principle of our nature ought either to be indulged or restrained What is agreeable to our moral faculties is fit and right and proper to be done the contrary wrong unfit and improper The sentiments which they approve of are graceful and becoming the contrary ungraceful and unbecoming The very words right wrong fit improper graceful unbecoming mean only what pleases or displeases those faculties  Since these therefore were plainly intended to be the governing principles of human nature the rules which they prescribe are to be regarded as the commands and laws of the Deity promulgated by those vicegerents which he has thus set up within us All general rules are commonly denominated laws thus the general rules which bodies observe in the communication of motion are called the laws of motion But those general rules which our moral faculties observe in approving or condemning whatever sentiment or action is subjected to their examination may much more justly be denominated such They have a much greater resemblance to what are properly called laws those general rules which the sovereign lays down to direct the conduct of his subjects Like  hem they are rules to direct the free ac  ions of men they are prescribed most  urely by a lawful superior and are at  ended too with the sanction of rewards  nd punishments Those vicegerents of God within us never fail to punish the  iolation of them by the torments of inward shame and selfcondemnation and  n the contrary always reward obedience  with tranquility of mind with contentment and selfsatisfaction  There are innumerable other considerations which serve to confirm the same conclusion The happiness of mankind as well as of all other rational creatures seems to have been the original purpose intended by the Author of Nature when he brought them into existence No other end seems worthy of that supreme wisdom and divine benignity which we necessarily ascribe to him and this opinion which we are led to by the abstract consideration of his infinite perfections is still more confirmed by the examination of the works of nature which seem all intended to promote happiness and to guard against misery But by acting according to the dictates of our moral faculties we necessarily pursue the most effectual means for promoting the happiness of mankind and may therefore be said in some sense to cooperate with the Deity and to advance as far as in our power the plan of Providence By acting otherways on the contrary we seem to obstruct in some measure the scheme which the Author of Nature has established for the happiness and perfection of the  world and to declare ourselves if I may say so in some measure the enemies of God Hence we are naturally encouraged to hope for his extraordinary favour and reward in the one case and to dread his vengeance and punishment in the other  There are besides many other reasons and many other natural principles which all tend to confirm and inculcate the same salutary doctrine If we consider the general rules by which external prosperity and adversity are commonly distributed in this life we shall find that notwithstanding the disorder in which all things appear to be in this world yet even here every virtue naturally meets with its proper reward with the recompense which is most fit to encourage and promote it and this too so surely that it requires a very extraordinary concurrence of circumstances entirely to disappoint it What is the reward most proper for encouraging industry prudence and circumspection Success in every sort of business And is it possible that in the whole of life these virtues should fail of attaining it Wealth and external honours are their proper recompence and  the recompence which they can seldom fail of acquiring What reward is most proper for promoting the practice of truth justice and humanity The confidence the esteem and love of those we live with Humanity does not desire to be great but to be beloved It is not in being rich that truth and justice would rejoice but in being trusted and believed recompences which those virtues must almost always acquire By some very extraordinary and unlucky circumstance a good man may come to be suspected of a crime of which he was altogether incapable and upon that account be most unjustly exposed for the remaining part of his life to the horror and aversion of mankind By an accident of this kind he may be said to lose his all notwithstanding his integrity and justice in the same manner as a cautious man notwithstanding his utmost circumspection may be ruined by an earthquake or an inundation Accidents of the first kind however are perhaps still more rare and still more contrary to the common course of things than those of the second and it still remains true that the practice of truth justice and humanity is a certain  and almost infallible method of acquiring what those virtues chiefly aim at the confidence and love of those we live with A person may be very easily misrepresented with regard to a particular action but it is scarce possible that he should be so with regard to the general tenor of his conduct An innocent man may be believed to have done wrong this however will rarely happen On the contrary the established opinion of the innocence of his manners will often lead us to absolve him where he has really been in the fault notwithstanding very strong presumptions A knave in the same manner may escape censure or even meet with applause for a particular knavery in which his conduct is not understood But no man was ever habitually such without being almost universally known to be so and without being even frequently suspected of guilt when he was in reality perfectly innocent And so far as vice and virtue can be either punished or rewarded by the sentiments and opinions of mankind they both according to the common course of things meet even here with something more than exact and impartial justice  But tho' the general rules by which prosperity and adversity are commonly distributed when considered in this cool and philosophical light appear to be perfectly suited to the situation of mankind in this life yet they are by no means suited to some of our natural sentiments Our natural love and admiration for some virtues is such that we should wish to bestow on them all sorts of honours and rewards even those which we must acknowledge to be the proper recompences of other qualities with which those virtues are not always accompanied Our detestation on the contrary for some vices is such that we should desire to heap upon them every sort of disgrace and disaster those not excepted which are the natural consequences of very different qualities Magnanimity generosity and justice command so high a degree of admiration that we desire to see them crowned with wealth and power and honours of every kind the natural consequences of prudence industry and application qualities with which those virtues are not inseparably connected Fraud falsehood brutality and violence  on the other hand excite in every human breast such scorn and abhorrence that our indignation rouzes to see them possess those advantages which they may in some sense be said to have merited by the diligence and industry with which they are sometimes attended The industrious knave cultivates the soil the indolent good man leaves it uncultivated Who ought to reap the harvest who starve and who live in plenty The natural course of things decides it in favour of the knave the natural sentiments of mankind in favour of the man of virtue Man judges that the good qualities of the one are greatly overrecompensed by those advantages which they tend to procure him and that the omissions of the other are by far too severely punished by the distress which they naturally bring upon him and human laws the consequences of human sentiments forfeit the life and the estate of the industrious and cautious traitour and reward by extraordinary recompenses the fidelity and public spirit of the improvident and careless good citizen Thus man is by nature directed to correct in some measure that distribution of things which she herself  would otherwise have made The rules which for this purpose she prompts him to follow are different from those which she herself observes She bestows upon every virtue and upon every vice that precise reward or punishment which is best fitted to encourage the one or to restrain the other She is directed by this sole consideration and pays little regard to the different degrees of merit and demerit which they may seem to possess in the sentiments and passions of man Man on the contrary pays regard to this only and would endeavour to render the state of every virtue precisely proportioned to that degree of love and esteem and of every vice to that degree of contempt and abhorrence which he himself conceives for it The rules which she follows are fit for her those which he follows for him but both are calculated to promote the same great end the order of the world and the perfection and happiness of human nature  But tho' man is thus employed to alter that distribution of things which natural events would make if left to themselves tho' like the Gods of the poets he is perpetually interposing by extraordinary  means in favour of virtue and in opposition to vice and like them endeavours to turn away the arrow that is aimed at the head of the righteous but accelerates the sword of destruction that is lifted up against the wicked yet he is by no means able to render the fortune of either quite suitable to his own sentiments and wishes The natural course of things cannot be entirely controuled by the impotent endeavours of man the current is too rapid and too strong for him to stop it and tho' the rules which direct it appear to have been established for the wisest and best purposes they sometimes produce effects which shock all his natural sentiments That a great combination of men should prevail over a small one that those who engage in an enterprize with forethought and all necessary preparation should prevail over such as oppose them without any and that every end should be acquired by those means only which nature has established for acquiring it seems to be a rule not only necessary and unavoidable in itself but even useful and proper for rouzing the industry and attention of mankind Yet when in consequence  of this rule violence and artifice prevail over sincerity and justice What indignation does it not excite in the breast of every human spectator What sorrow and compassion for the sufferings of the innocent and what furious resentment against the success of the oppressor We are equally grieved and enraged at the wrong that is done but often find it altogether out of our power to redress it▪ When we thus despair of finding any force upon earth which can check the triumph of injustice we naturally appeal to heaven and hope that the great author of our nature will himself execute hereafter what all the principles which he has given us for the direction of our conduct prompt us to attempt even here that he will compleat the plan which he himself has thus taught us to begin and will in a life to come render to every one according to the works which he has performed in this world And thus we are led to the belief of a future state not only by the weaknesses by the hopes and fears of human nature but by the noblest and best principles which belong to it by the love  of virtue and by the abhorrence of vice and injustice  "Does it suit the greatness of God" says the eloquent and philosophical bishop of Clermont with that passionate and exaggerating force of imagination which seems sometimes to exceed the bounds of decorum  does it suit the greatness of God to leave the world which he has created in so universal a disorder To see the wicked prevail almost always over the just the innocent dethroned by the usurper the father become the victim of the ambition of an unnatural son the husband expiring under the stroak of a barbarous and faithless wife From the height of his greatness ought God to behold those melancholy events as a fantastical amusement without taking any share in them Because he is great should he be weak or unjust or barbarous Because men are little ought they to be allowed either to be dissolute without punishment or virtuous without reward O God if this is the character of your Supreme Being if it is you whom we adore under such dreadful ideas can I  longer acknowledge you for my father for my protector for the comforter of my sorrow the support of my weakness the rewarder of my fidelity You would then be no more but an indolent and fantastical tyrant who sacrifices mankind to his insolent vanity and who has brought them out of nothing only to make them serve for the sport of his leisure and of his caprice  When the general rules which determine the merit and demerit of actions come thus to be regarded as the laws of an Allpowerful Being who watches over our conduct and who in a life to come will reward the observance and punish the breach of them they necessarily acquire a new sacredness from this consideration That our regard to the will of the Deity ought to be the supreme rule of our conduct can be doubted of by no body who believes his existence The very thought of disobedience appears to involve in it the most shocking impropriety How vain how absurd would it be for man either to oppose or to neglect the commands that were laid upon him  by Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Power How unnatural how impiously ungrateful not to reverence the precepts that were prescribed to him by the infinite goodness of his Creator even tho' no punishment was to follow their violation The sense of propriety too is here well supported by the strongest motives of selfinterest The idea that however we may escape the observation of man or be placed above the reach of human punishment yet we are always acting under the eye and exposed to the punishment of God the great avenger of injustice is a motive capable of restraining the most headstrong passions with those at least who by constant reflection have rendered it familiar to them  It is in this manner that religion enforces the natural sense of duty and hence it is that mankind are generally disposed to place great confidence in the probity of those who seem deeply impressed with religious sentiments Such persons they imagine act under an additional tye besides those which regulate the conduct of other men The regard to the propriety of action as well as to reputation the  regard to the applause of his own breast as well as to that of others are motives which they suppose have the same influence over the religious man as over the man of the world But the former lies under another restraint and never acts deliberately but as in the presence of that Great Superior who is finally to recompense him according to his deeds A greater trust is reposed upon this account in the regularity and exactness of his conduct And wherever the natural principles of religion are not corrupted by the factious and party zeal of some worthless cabal wherever the first duty which it requires is to fulfil all the obligations of morality wherever men are not taught to regard frivolous observances as more immediate duties of religion than acts of justice and beneficence and to imagine that by sacrifices and ceremonies and vain supplications they can bargain with the Deity for fraud and perfidy and violence the world undoubtedly judges right in this respect and justly places a double confidence in the rectitude of the religious man's behaviour  CHAP IV In what cases the sense of duty ought to be the sole principle of our conduct and in what cases it ought to concur with other motives  RELIGION affords such strong motives to the practice of virtue and guards us by such powerful restraints from the temptations of vice that many have been led to suppose that religious principles were the sole laudable motives of action We ought neither they said to reward from gratitude nor punish from resentment we ought neither to protect the helplessness of our children nor afford support to the infirmities of our parents from natural affection All affections for particular objects ought to be extinguished in our breast and one great affection take the place of all others the love of the Deity the desire of rendering ourselves agreeable to him and of directing our conduct in every respect according to his will We ought not to be grateful from gratitude we ought not to  be charitable from humanity we ought not to be public spirited from the love of our country nor generous and just from the love of mankind The sole principle and motive of our conduct in the performance of all those different duties ought to be a sense that God has commanded us to perform them I shall not at present take time to examine this opinion particularly I shall only observe that we should not have expected to have found it entertained by any sect who professed themselves of a religion in which as it is the first precept to love the Lord our God with all our heart with all our soul and with all our strength so it is the second to love our neighbour as we love ourselves and we love ourselves surely for our own sakes and not merely because we are commanded to do so That the sense of duty should be the sole principle of our conduct is no where the precept of Christianity but that it should be the ruling and the governing one as philosophy and as indeed common sense directs It may be a question however in what cases our actions ought to arise chiefly or entirely from a sense of duty or from  a regard to general rules and in what cases some other sentiment or affection ought to concur and have a principal influence  The decision of this question which cannot perhaps be given with any very great accuracy will depend upon two different circumstances first upon the natural agreeableness or deformity of the sentiment or affection which would prompt us to any action independent of all regard to general rules and secondly upon the precision and exactness or the looseness and inaccuracy of the general rules themselves  I First I say it will depend upon the natural agreeableness or deformity of the affection itself how far our actions should arise from it or entirely proceed from a regard to the general rule  All those graceful and admired actions  o which the benevolent affections would prompt us ought to proceed as much from the passions themselves as from any regard to the general rules of conduct A benefactor thinks himself but ill requited if the person upon whom he has be  towed his good offices repays them merely  from a cold sense of duty and without any affection to his person A husband is dissatisfied with the most obedient wife when he imagines her conduct is animated by no other principle besides her regard to what the relation she stands in requires Tho' a son should fail in none of the offices of filial duty yet if he wants that affectionate reverence which it so well becomes him to feel the parent may justly complain of his indifference Nor could a son be quite satisfied with a parent who tho' he performed all the duties of his situation had nothing of that fatherly fondness which might have been expected from him With regard to all such benevolent and social affections it is agreeable to see the sense of duty employed rather to restrain than to enliven them rather to hinder us from doing too much than to prompt us to do what we ought It gives us pleasure to see a father obliged to check his own fondness a friend obliged to set bounds to his natural generosity a person who has received a benefit obliged to restrain the too sanguine gratitude of his own temper  The contrary maxim takes place with regard to the malevolent and unsocial passions We ought to reward from the gratitude and generosity of our own hearts without any reluctance and without being obliged to reflect how great the propriety of rewarding but we ought always to punish with reluctance and more from a sense of the propriety of punishing than from any savage disposition to revenge Nothing is more graceful than the behaviour of the man who appears to  resent the greatest injuries more from a sense that they deserve and are the proper objects of resentment than from feeling himself the furies of that disagreeable passion who like a judge considers only  he general rule which determines what vengeance is due for each particular offence who in executing that rule feels  ess for what himself has suffered than for what the offender is about to suffer who  ho' in wrath remembers mercy and is disposed to interpret the rule in the most gentle and favourable manner and to al  ow of all the alleviations which the most  andid humanity could consistently with good sense admit of  As the selfish passions according to what has formerly been observed hold in other respects a sort of middle place between the social and unsocial affections so do they likewise in this The pursuit of the objects of private interest in all common little and ordinary cases ought to flow rather from a regard to the general rules which prescribe such conduct than from any passion for the objects themselves but upon more important and extraordinary occasions we should be aukward insipid and ungraceful if the objects themselves did not appear to animate us with a considerable degree of passion To be anxious or to be laying a plot either to gain or to save a single shilling would degrade the most vulgar tradesman in the opinion of all his neighbours Let his circumstances be ever so mean no attention to any such small matters for the sake of the things themselves must appear in his conduct His situation may require the most severe oeconomy and the mo  exact assiduity but each particular exertion of that oeconomy and assiduity must proceed not so much from a regard for that particular saving or gain as for the general  rule which to him prescribes with the utmost rigour such a tenor of conduct His parsimony to day must not arise from  desire of the particular three pence which  e will save by it nor his attendance in  is shop from a passion for the particular  pence which he will acquire by it  oth the one and the other ought to pro  eed solely from a regard to the general  ule which prescribes with the most un  elenting severity this plan of conduct to  ll persons in his way of life In this con  sts the difference between the character of  miser and that of a person of exact oeco  omy and assiduity The one is anxious  out small matters for their own sake  other attends to them only in conse  ence of the scheme of life which he has  down to himself  It is quite otherwise with regard to the  ore extraordinary and important objects  f selfinterest A person appears mean  irited who does not pursue these with  degree of earnestness for their own  We should despise a prince who was  ot anxious about conquering or defend  g a province We should have little re  ect for a private gentleman who did not  exert himself to gain an estate or even a considerable office when he could acquire them without either meanness or injustice A member of parliament who shews no keenness about his own election is abandoned by his friends as altogether unworthy of their attachment Even a tradesman is thought a poorspirited fellow among his neighbours who does not bestir himself to get what they call an extraordinary job or some uncommon advantage This spirit and keenness constitutes the difference betwixt the man of enterprize and the man of dull regularity Those great objects of selfinterest of which the loss or acquisition quite changes the rank of the person are the objects of the passion properly called ambition a passion which when it keeps within the bounds of prudence and justice is always admired in the world and has even sometimes a certain irregular greatness which dazzles the imagination when it passes the limits of both these virtues and is not only unjust but extravagant Hence the general admiration for Heroes and Conquerors and even for Statesmen whose projects have been  ery daring and extensive tho' altogether  evoid of justice Such as those of the Cardinals of Richlieu and of Retz The  bjects of avarice and ambition differ only in their greatness A miser is as  urious about a halfpenny as a man of ambition about the conquest of a king  om  II Secondly I say it will depend part  y upon the precision and exactness or  he looseness and inaccuracy of the gene  al rules themselves how far our conduct ought to proceed entirely from a regard to them  The general rules of almost all the virtues the general rules which determine what are the offices of prudence of charity of generosity of gratitude of friendship are in many respects loose and inaccurate admit of many exceptions and require so many modifications that it is scarce possible to regulate our conduct en  irely by a regard to them The common proverbial maxims of prudence being founded in universal experience are perhaps the best general rules which can be given about it To affect however a  very strict and literal adherence to them would evidently be the most absurd and ridiculous pedantry Of all the virtues I have just now mentioned gratitude is that perhaps of which the rules are the most precise and admit of the fewest exceptions That as soon as we can we should make a return of equal and if possible of superior value to the services we have received would seem to be a pretty plain rule and one which admitted of scarce any exceptions Upon the most superficial examination however this rule will appear to be in the highest degree loose and inaccurate and to admit of ten thousand exceptions If your benefactor attended you in your sickness ought you to attend him in his or can you fulfil the obligation of gratitude by making a return of a different kind If you ought to attend him how long ought you to attend him The same time which he attended you or longer and how much longer If your friend lent you money in your distress ought you to lend him money in his How much ought you to lend him When  ought you to lend it him Now or tomorrow or next month And for how long a time It is evident that no general rule can be laid down by which a precise answer can in all cases be given to any of these questions The difference between his character and your's between his circumstances and your's may be such that you may be perfectly grateful and justly refuse to lend him a halfpenny and on the contrary you may be willing to lend or even to give him ten times the sum which he lent you and yet justly be accused of the blackest ingratitude and of not having fulfilled the hundredth part of the obligation you lie under As the duties of gratitude however are perhaps the most sacred of all those which the beneficent virtues prescribe to us so the general rules which determine them are as I said before the most accurate Those which ascertain the actions required by friendship humanity hospitality generosity are still more vague and indeterminate  There is however one virtue of which the general rules determine with the greatest  exactness every external action which it requires This virtue is justice The rules of justice are accurate in the highest degree and admit of no exceptions or modifications but such as may be ascertained as accurately as the rules themselves and which generally indeed flow from the very same principles with them If I owe a man ten pounds justice requires that I should precisely pay him ten pounds either at the time agreed upon or when he demands it What I ought to perform how much I ought to perform when and where I ought to perform it the whole nature and circumstances of the action prescribed are all of them precisely fixt and determined Tho' it may be aukward and pedantic therefore  affect too strict an adherence to the common rules of prudence or generosity there is no pedantry in sticking fast by the rule  of justice On the contrary the most sacred regard is due to them and  actions which this virtue requires are never so properly performed as when the chief motive for performing them is a reverential and religious regard to thos  general rules which require them In the practice of the other virtues our conduct should rather be directed by a certain idea of propriety by a certain taste for a particular tenor of conduct than by any regard to a precise maxim or rule and we should consider the end and foundation of the rule more than the rule itself But it is otherwise with regard to justice the man who in that refines the least and adheres with the most obstinate stedfastness to the general rules themselves is the most commendable and the most to be depended upon Tho' the end of the rules of justice be to hinder us from hurting our neighbour it may frequently be a crime to violate them tho' we could pretend with some pretext of reason that this particular violation could do no hurt A man often becomes a villain the moment he begins even in his own heart to chicane in this manner The moment he thinks of departing from the most staunch and positive adherence to what those inviolable precepts prescribe to him he is no longer to be trusted and no man can say what degree of guilt he may not arrive  at The thief imagines he does no evil▪ when he steals from the rich what he supposes they may easily want and what possibly they may never even know has been stolen from them The adulterer imagines he does no evil when he corrupts the wife of his friend provided he covers his intrigue from the suspicion of the husband and does not disturb the peace of the family When once we begin to give way to such refinements there is no enormity so gross of which we may not be capable  The rules of justice may be compared to the rules of grammar the rules of the other virtues to the rules which criticks lay down for the attainment of what is sublime and elegant in composition The one are precise accurate and indispensible The other are loose vague and indeterminate and present us rather with a general idea of the perfection we ought to aim at than afford us any certain and infallible directions for acquiring it A man may learn to write grammatically by rule with the most absolute infallibility and so perhaps he may be taught to act justly  But there are no rules whose observance will infallibly lead us to the attainment of elegance or sublimity in writing tho' there are some which may help us in some measure to correct and ascertain the vague ideas which we might otherwise have entertained of those perfections and there are no rules by the knowledge of which we can infallibly be taught to act upon all occasions with prudence with just magnanimity or proper beneficence Tho' there are some which may enable us to correct and ascertain in several respects the imperfect ideas which we might otherwise have entertained of those virtues  It may sometimes happen that with the most serious and earnest desire of acting so as to deserve approbation we may mistake the proper rules of conduct and thus be misled by that very principle which ought to direct us It is in vain to expect that in this case mankind should entirely approve of our behaviour They cannot enter into that absurd idea of duty which influenced us nor go along with any of the actions which follow from it There is still however something respectable  in the character and behaviour of one who is thus betrayed into vice by a wrong sense of duty or by what is called an erroneous conscience How fatally soever he may be misled by it he is still with the generous and humane more the object of commiseration than of hatred or resentment They lament the weakness of human nature which exposes us to such unhappy delusions even while we are most sincerely labouring after perfection and endeavouring to act according to the best principle which can possibly direct us False notions of religion are almost the only causes which can occasion any very gross perversion of our natural sentiments in this way and that principle which gives the greatest authority to the rules of duty is alone capable of distorting our ideas of them in any considerable degree In all other cases common sense is sufficient to direct us if not to the most exquisite propriety of co  duct yet to something which is not very far from it and provided we are in earnest desirous to do well our behaviour will always upon the whole be praiseworthy That to obey the will of the  Deity is the first rule of duty all men are agreed But concerning the particular commandments which that will may impose upon us they differ widely from one another In this therefore the greatest mutual forbearance and toleration is due and tho' the defence of society requires that crimes should be punished from whatever motives they proceed yet a good man will always punish them with reluctance when they evidently proceed from false notions of religious duty He will never feel against those who commit them that indignation which he feels against other criminals but will rather regret and sometimes even admire their unfortunate firmness and magnanimity at the very time that he punishes their crime In the tragedy of Mahomet one of the finest of Mr Voltaire's it is well represented what ought to be our sentiments for crimes which proceed from such mo  ves In that tragedy two young people of different sexes of the most innocent and virtuous dispositions and without any other weakness except what endears them the more to us a mutual fondness for one another are instigated  by the strongest motives of a false religion to commit a horrid murder that shocks all the principles of human nature a venerable old man who had expressed the most tender affection for them both for whom notwithstanding he was the avowed enemy of their religion they had both conceived the highest reverence and esteem and who was in reality their father tho' they did not know him to be such is pointed out to them as a sacrifice which God had expressly required at their hands and they are commanded to kill him While they are about executing this crime they are tortured with all the agonies which can arise from the struggle between the idea of the indispensibleness of religious duty on the one side and compassion gratitude reverence for the age and love for the humanity and virtue of the person whom they are going to destroy on the other The representation of this exhibits one of the most interesting and perhaps the most instructive spectacle that was ever introduced upon any theatre The sense of duty however at last prevails over all the amiable weaknesses of human nature They execute the crime  imposed upon them but immediately discover their error▪ and the fraud which had deceived them and are distracted with horror remorse and resentment Such as are our sentiments for the unhappy Seid and Palmira such ought we to feel for every person who is in this manner misled by religion when we are sure that it is really religion which misleads him and not the pretence of it which is made a cover to some of the worst of human passions  As a person may act wrong by following a wrong sense of duty so nature may sometimes prevail and lead him to act right in opposition to it We cannot in this case be displeased to see that motive prevail which we think ought to prevail tho' the person himself is so weak as to think otherwise As his conduct however is the effect of weakness not principle we are far from bestowing upon it any thing that approaches to compleat approbation A bigotted Roman Catholic who during the massacre of St Bartholomew had been so overcome by compassion as to save some unhappy protestants whom he thought it his duty to destroy would not seem to be entitled to  that high applause which we should have bestowed upon him had he exerted the same generosity with compleat selfapprobation We might be pleased with the humanity of his temper but we should still regard him with a sort of pity which is altogether inconsistent with the admiration that is due to perfect virtue It is the same case with all the other passions We do not dislike to see them exert themselves properly even when a false notion of duty would direct the person to restrain them A very devout Quaker who upon being struck upon one cheek instead of turning up the other should so far forget his literal interpretation of our Saviour's precept as to bestow some good discipline upon the brute that insulted him would not be disagreeable to us We should laugh and be diverted with his spirit and rather like him the better for it But we should by no means regard him with that respect and esteem which would seem due to one who upon a like occasion had acted properly from a just sense of what was proper to be done No action can properly be called virtuous which is not accompanied with the sentiment of selfapprobation  PART IV Of the EFFECT of UTILITY upon the sentiment of approbation  SECT I Of the beauty which the appearance of UTILITY bestows upon all the productions of art and of the extensive influence of this species of beauty  THAT utility is one of the principal sources of beauty has been observed by every body who has considered with any attention what constitutes the nature of beauty The conveniency of a house gives pleasure to the spectator as well as its regularity and he is as much hurt when he observes the contrary defect as when he sees the correspondent windows of different forms or the door not placed exactly in the middle of the building That the fitness of any system or machine to produce the end for which it was intended bestows a certain propriety and  beauty upon the whole and renders the very thought and contemplation of it agreeable is so very obvious that nobody has overlooked it  The cause too why utility pleases has of late been assigned by an ingenious and agreeable philosopher who joins the greatest depth of thought to the greatest elegance of expression and possesses the singular and happy talent of treating the abstrusest subjects not only with the most perfect perspicuity but with the most lively eloquence The utility of any object according to him pleases the master by perpetually suggesting to him the pleasure or conveniency which it is fitted to promote Every time he looks at it he is put in mind of this pleasure and the object in this manner becomes a source of perpetual satisfaction and enjoyment The spectator enters by sympathy into the sentiments of the master and necessarily views the object under the same agreeable aspect When we visit the palaces of the great we cannot help conceiving the satisfaction we should enjoy if we ourselves were the masters and were possessed of so much artful and ingeniously contrived accommodation A similar account is given why the appearance of inconveniency  should render any object disagreeable both to the owner and to the spectator  But that this fitness this happy contrivance of any production of art should often be more valued than the very end for which it was intended and that the exact adjustment of the means for attaining any conveniency or pleasure should frequently be more regarded than that very conveniency or pleasure in the attainment of which their whole merit would seem to consist has not so far as I know been yet taken notice of by any body That this however is very frequently the case may be observed in a thousand instances both in the most frivolous and in the most important concerns of human life  When a person comes into his chamber and finds the chairs all standing in the middle of the room he is angry with his servant and rather than see them continue in that disorder perhaps takes the trouble himself to set them all in their places with their backs to the wall The whole propriety of this new situation arises from its superior conveniency in leaving the floor free and disengaged To attain this conveniency he voluntarily puts himself to more trouble than all he could  have suffered from the want of it since nothing was more easy than to have set himself down upon one of them which is probably what he does when his labour is over What he wanted therefore it seems was not so much this conveniency as that arangement of things which promotes it Yet it is this conveniency which ultimately recommends that arrangement and bestows upon it the whole of its propriety and beauty  A watch in the same manner that falls behind above two minutes in a day is despised by one curious in watches He sells it perhaps for a couple of guineas and purchases another at fifty which will not lose above a minute in a fortnight The sole use of watches however is to tell us what o'clock it is and to hinder us from breaking any engagement or suffering any other inconveniency by our ignorance in that particular point But the person so nice with regard to this machine will not always be found either more scrupulously punctual than other men or more anxiously concerned upon any other account to know precisely what time of day it is What interests him is not so much the attainment of this piece of knowledge  as the perfection of the machine that serves to attain it  How many people ruin themselves by laying out money on trinkets of frivolous utility What pleases these lovers of toys is not so much the utility as the aptness of the machines that are fitted to promote it All their pockets are stuffed with little conveniencies They contrive new pockets unknown in the cloaths of other people in order to carry a greater number They walk about loaded with a multitude of baubles in weight and sometimes in value not inferior to an ordinary Jewsbox some of which may sometimes be of some little use but all of which might at all times be very well spared and of which the whole utility is certainly not worth the fatigue of bearing the burden  Nor is it only with regard to such frivolous objects that our conduct is influenced by this principle it is often the secret motive of the most serious and important pursuits of both private and public life  The poor man's son whom heaven in its anger has visited with ambition when he begins to look around him admires the condition of the rich He finds the cottage of his father too small for his accommodation  and fancies he should be lodged more at his ease in a palace He is displeased with being obliged to walk afoot or to endure the fatigue of riding on horseback He sees his superiors carried about in machines and imagines that in one of these he could travel with less inconveniency He feels himself naturally indolent and willing to serve himself with his own hands as little as possible and judges that a numerous retinue of servants would save him from a great deal of trouble He thinks if he had attained all these he could sit still contentedly and be quiet enjoying himself in the thought of the happiness and tranquillity of his situation He is enchanted with the distant idea of this felicity It appears in his fancy like the life of some superior rank of beings▪ and in order to arrive at it he devotes himself for ever to the pursuit of wealth and greatness To obtain the conveniencies which these afford he submits in the first year nay in the first month of his application to more fatigue of body and more uneasiness of mind than he could have suffered through the whole of his life from the want of them He studies to distinguish himself in some laborious profession With the most unrelenting  industry he labours night and day to acquire talents superior to all his competitors He endeavours next to bring those talents into public view and with equal assiduity solicits every opportunity of employment For this purpose he makes his court to all mankind he serves those whom he hates and is obsequious to those whom he despises Through the whole of his life he pursues the idea of a certain artificial and elegant repose which he may never arrive at for which he sacrifices a real tranquillity that is at all times in his power and which if in the extremity of old age he should at last attain to it he will find to be in no respect preferable to that humble security and contentment which he had abandoned for it It is then in the last dregs of life his body wasted with toil and diseases his mind gauled and ruffled by the memory of a thousand injuries and disappointments which he imagines he has met with from the injustice of his enemies or from the perfidy and ingratitude of his friends that he begins at last to find that wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utility no more adapted for procuring ease of body or tranquillity of mind than the tweezercases of the lover of toys  and like them too more troublesome to the person who carries them about with him than all the advantages they can afford him are commodious There is no other real difference between them except that the conveniencies of the one are somewhat more observable than those of the other The palaces the gardens the equipage the retinue of the great are objects of which the obvious conveniency strikes every body They do not require that their masters should point out to us wherein consists their utility Of our own accord we readily enter into it and by sympathy enjoy and thereby applaud the satisfaction which they are fitted to afford him But the curiosity of a toothpick of an earpicker of a machine for cutting the nails or of any other trinket of the same kind is not so obvious Their conveniency may perhaps be equally great but it is not so striking and we do not so readily enter into the satisfaction of the man who possesses them They are therefore less reasonable subjects of vanity than the magnificence of wealth and greatness and in this consists the sole advantage of these last They more effectually gratify that love of distinction so natural to man To one who was to live  alone in a desolate island it might be a matter of doubt perhaps whether a palace or a collection of such small conveniencies as are commonly contained in a tweezercase would contribute most to his happiness and enjoyment If he is to live in society indeed there can be no comparison because in this as in all other cases we constantly pay more regard to the sentiments of the spectator than to those of the person principally concern'd and consider rather how his situation will appear to other people than how it will appear to himself If we examine however why the spectator distinguishes with such admiration the condition of the rich and the great we shall find that it is not so much upon account of the superior ease or pleasure which they are supposed to enjoy as of the numberless artificial and elegant contrivances for promoting this ease or pleasure He does not even imagine that they are really happier than other people but he imagines that they possess more means of happiness And it is the ingenious and artful adjustment of those means to the end for which they were intended that is the principal source of his admiration  But in the languor of disease and the weariness of old age the pleasures of the vain and empty distinctions of greatness disappear To one in this situation they are no longer capable of recommending those toilsome pursuits in which they had formerly engaged him In his heart he curses ambition and vainly regrets the ease and the indolence of youth pleasures which are fled forever and which he has foolishly sacrificed for what when he has got it can afford him no real satisfaction  In this miserable aspect does greatness appear to every man when reduced either by spleen or disease to observe with attention his own situation and to consider what it is that is really wanting to his happiness Power and riches appear then to be what they are enormous and operose machines contrived to produce a few triffling conveniencies to the body consisting of springs the most nice and delicate which must be kept in order with the most anxious attention and which in spite of all our care are ready every moment to burst into pieces and to crush in their ruins their unfortunate possessor They are immense fabrics which it requires the labour of a life to raise which threaten every  moment to overwhelm the person who dwells in them and which while they stand though they may save him from some smaller inconveniencies can protect him from none of the severer inclemencies of the season They keep off the summer shower not the winter storm but leave him always as much and sometimes more exposed than before to anxiety to fear and to sorrow to diseases to danger and to death  But tho' this splenetic philosophy which in time of sickness or low spirits is familiar to every man thus entirely depreciates those great objects of human desire when in better health and in better humour we never fail to regard them under a more agreeable aspect Our imagination which in pain and sorrow seems to be confined and cooped up within our own persons in times of ease and prosperity expands itself to every thing around us We are then charmed with the beauty of that accomodation which reigns in the palaces and oeconomy of the great and admire how every  hing is adapted to promote their ease to prevent their wants to gratify their wishes and to amuse and entertain their most frivo  ous desires If we consider the real satisfaction which all these things are capable of  affording by itself and seperated from the beauty of that arangement which is fitted to promote it it will always appear in the highest degree contemptible and trifling But we rarely view it in this abstract and philosophical light We naturally confound it in our imagination with the order the regular and harmonious movement of the system the machine or oeconomy by means of which it is produced The pleasures of wealth and greatness when considered in this complex view strike the imagination as something grand and beautiful and noble of which the attainment is well worth all the to  and anxiety which we are so apt to bestow upon it  And it is well that nature imposes upon us in this manner It is this deception which rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankind It is this which first prompted them to cultivate the ground to build houses to found cities and commonwealths and to invent and improve all the sciences and arts which ennoble and embellish human life which have entirely changed the whole face of the globe have turned the rude forests of nature into agreeable and fertile plains and made the trackless and barren  ocean a new fund of subsistence and the great high road of communication to the different nations of the earth The earth by these labours of mankind has been obliged to redouble her natural fertility and to maintain a greater multitude of inhabitants It is to no purpose that the proud and unfeeling landlord views his extensive fields and without a thought for the wants of his brethren in imagination consumes himself the whole harvest that grows upon them The homely and vulgar proverb that the eye is larger than the belly never was more fully verified than with regard to him The capacity of his stomach bears no proportion to the immensity of his desires and will receive no more than that of the meanest peasant The rest he is obliged to distribute among those who prepare in the nicest manner that little which he himself makes use of among those who fit up the palace in which this little is to be consumed among those who provide and keep in order all the different baubles and trinkets which are employed in the oeconomy of greatness all of whom thus derive from his luxury and caprice that share of the necessaries of life which they would in vain have expected from his humanity or his justice The  produce of the soil maintains at all times nearly that number of inhabitants which it is capable of maintaining The rich only select from the heap what is most precious and agreeable They consume little more tha  the poor and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity tho' they mean only their own conveniency tho' the sole end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life which would have been made had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants and thus without intending it without knowing it advance the interest of the society and afford means to the multiplication of the species When providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition▪ These last too enjoy their share of all that i  produces In what constitutes the real happiness of human life they are in no respect inferior to those who would seem so much  bove them In ease of body and peace of  ind all the different ranks of life are nearly  pon a level and the beggar who suns him  elf by the side of the highway possesses that  ecurity which kings are fighting for  The same principle the same love of sys  em the same regard to the beauty of order  f art and contrivance frequently serves to  ecommend those institutions which tend to  romote the public welfare When a patriot  xerts himself for the improvement of any  art of the public police his conduct does not  lways arise from pure sympathy with the  appiness of those who are to reap the bene  t of it It is not commonly from a fellow  eeling with carriers and waggoners that a  ublic spirited man encourages the mending  f high roads When the legislature estab  shes praemiums and other encouragements  o advance the linnen or woollen manufactu  es its conduct seldom proceeds from pure  mpathy with the wearer of cheap or fine  loth and much less from that with the ma  ufacturer or merchant The perfection of  olice the extension of trade and manufac  ures are noble and magnificent objects The contemplation of them pleases us and we are interested in whatever can tend to advance  them They make part of the great system of government and the wheels of the political machine seem to move with more harmony and ease by means of them We take pleasure in beholding the perfection of so beautiful and grand a system and we are uneasy till we remove any obstruction that can in the least disturb or incumber the regularity of its motions All constitutions of government however are valued only in proportion as they tend to promote the happiness of those who live under them This is their sole use and end From a certain spirit of system however from a certain love of art and contrivance we sometimes seem to value the means more than the end and to be eager to promote the happiness of our fellowcreatures rather from a view to perfect and improve a certain beautiful and orderly system than from any immediate sense o  feeling of what they either suffer or enjoy▪ There have been men of the greatest public spirit who have shown themselves in othe  respects not very sensible to the feelings o  humanity And on the contrary there have been men of the greatest humanity  seem to bave been entirely devoid of publi  spirit Every man may find in the circle  his acquaintance instances both of the one kind and the other Who had ever less humanity or more public spirit than the celebrated legislator of Muscovy The social and well natured James the first of GreatBritain seems on the contrary to have had scarce any passion either for the glory or the interest of his country Would you awaken the industry of the man who seems almost dead to ambition it will often be to no purpose to describe to him the happiness of the rich and the great to tell him that they are generally sheltered from the sun and the rain that they are seldom hungry that they are seldom cold and that they are rarely exposed to weariness or to want of any kind The most eloquent exhortation of this kind will have little effect upon him If you would hope to succeed you must describe to him the conveniency and arrangement of the different apartments in their palaces you must explain to him the propriety of their equipages and point out to him the number the order and the different offices of all their attendants If any thing is capable of making impression upon him this will Yet all these things tend only to keep off the sun and the rain to save them from hunger and cold from want and weariness  In the same manner if you would implant public virtue in the breast of him who seems heedless of the interest of his country it will often be to no purpose to tell him what superior advantages the subjects of a wellgoverned state enjoy that they are better lodged that they are better cloathed that they are better fed These considerations will commonly make no great impression You will be more likely to persuade if you describe the great system of public police which procures these advantages if you explain the connections and dependencies of its several parts their mutual subordination to one another and their general subserviency to the happiness of the society if you show how this system might be introduced into his own country what it is that hinders it from taking place there at present how those obstructions might be removed and all the several wheels of the machine of government be made to move with more harmony and smoothness without grating upon one another or mutually retarding one another's motions It is scarce possible that a man should listen to a discourse of this kind and not feel himself animated to some degree of public spirit He will at least for the moment feel some desire to remove those obstructions  and to put into motion so beautiful and so orderly a machine Nothing tends so much to promote public spirit as the study of politics of the several systems of civil government their advantages and disadvantages of the constitution of our own country its situation and interest with regard to foreign nations its commerce its defence the disadvantages it labours under the dangers to which it may be exposed how to remove the one and how to guard against the other Upon this account political disquisitions if just and reasonable and practicable are of all the works of speculation the most useful Even the weakest and the worst of them are not altogether without their utility They serve at least to animate the public passions of men and rouze them to seek out the means of promoting the happiness of the society  SECT II Of the beauty which the appearance of utility bestows upon the characters and actions of men and how far the perception of this beauty may be regarded as one of the original principles of approbation  THE characters of men as well as the contrivances of art or the institutions of civil government may be fitted either to promote or to disturb the happiness both of the individual and of the society The prudent the equitable the active resolute and sober character promises prosperity and satisfaction▪ both to the person himself and to every one connected with him The rash the insolent the slothful effeminate and voluptuous on the contrary forbodes ruin to the individual and misfortune to all who have any thing to do with him The first turn of mind has at least all the beauty which can belong to the most perfect machine that was ever invented for promoting the most agreeable purpose and the second all the deformity of the  most aukward and clumsy contrivance What institution of government could tend so much to promote the happiness of mankind as the general prevalence of wisdom and virtue All government is but an imperfect remedy for the deficiency of these Whatever beauty therefore can belong to civil government upon account of its utility must in a far superior degree belong to these On the contrary what civil policy can be so ruinous and destructive as the vices of men The fatal effects of bad government arise from nothing but that it does not sufficiently guard against the mischiefs which human wickedness gives occasion to  This beauty and deformity which characters appear to derive from their usefulness or inconveniency are apt to strike in a peculiar manner those who consider in an abstract and philosophical light the actions and conduct of mankind When a philosopher goes to examine why humanity is approved of or cruelty condemned he does▪ not always form to himself in a very clear and distinct manner the conception of any one particular action either of cruelty or of humanity but is commonly contented with the vague and indeterminate idea which the general names of  those qualities suggest to him But it is in particular instances only that the propriety or impropriety the merit and demerit of actions is very obvious and discernible It is only when particular examples are given that we perceive distinctly either the concord or disagreement between our own affections and those of the agent or feel a social gratitude arise towards him in the one case or a sympathetic resentment in the other When we consider virtue and vice in an abstract and general manner the qualities by which they excite these several sentiments seem in a great measure to disappear and the sentiments themselves become less obvious and discernible On the contrary the happy effects of the one and the fatal consequences of the other seem then to rise up to the view and as it were to stand out and distinguish themselves from all the other qualities of either  The same ingenious and agreeable author who first explained why utility pleases has been so struck with this view of things as to resolve our whole approbation of virtue into a perception of this species of beauty which results from the appearance of utility No qualities of the mind he observes are approved of as virtuous but such as are useful  or agreeable either to the person himself or to others and no qualities are disapproved of as vitious but such as have a contrary tendency And nature indeed seems to have so happily adjusted our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation to the conveniency both of the individual and of the society that after the strictest examination it will be found I believe that this is universally the case But still I affirm that it is not the view of this utility or hurtfulness which is either the first or principal source of our approbation and disapprobation These sentiments are no doubt enhanced and enlivened by the perception of the beauty or deformity which results from this utility or hurtfulness But still I say they are originally and essentially different from this perception  For first of all it seems impossible that the approbation of virtue should be a sentiment of the same kind with that by which we approve of a convenient and well contrived building or that we should have no other reason for praising a man than that for which we commend a chest of drawers  And secondly it will be found upon examination that the usefulness of any disposition of mind is seldom the first ground of  our approbation and that the sentiment of approbation always involves in it a sense of propriety quite distinct from the perception of utility We may observe this with regard to all the qualities which are approved of as virtuous both those which according to this system are originally valued as useful to ourselves as well as those which are esteemed on account of their usefulness to others  The qualities most useful to ourselves are first of all superior reason and understanding by which we are capable of discerning the remote consequences of all our actions and of forseeing the advantage or detriment which is likely to result from them and secondly selfcommand by which we are enabled to abstain from present pleasure or to endure present pain in order to obtain a greater pleasure or to avoid a greater pain in some future time In the union of those two qualities consists the virtue of prudence of all the virtues that which is most useful to the individual  With regard to the first of those qualities it has been observed upon a former occasion that superior reason and understanding are originally approved of as just and right and accurate and not meerly as useful or advantageous  It is in the abstruser sciences particularly in the higher parts of mathematics that the greatest and most admired exertions of human reason have been displayed But the utility of those sciences either to the individual or to the public is not very obvious and to prove it requires a discussion which is not always very easily comprehended It was not therefore their utility which first recommended them to the public admiration This quality was but little insisted upon till it became necessary to make some reply to the reproaches of those who having themselves no taste for such sublime discoveries endeavoured to depreciate them as useless  That selfcommand in the same manner by which we restrain our present appetites in order to gratify them more fully upon another occasion is approved of as much under the aspect of propriety as under that of utility When we act in this manner the sentiments which influence our conduct seem exactly to coincide with those of the spectator The spectator does not feel the sollicitations of our present appetites To him the pleasure which we are to enjoy a week hence or a year hence is just as interesting as that which we are to  enjoy this moment When for the sake of the present therefore we sacrifice the future our conduct appears to him absurd and extravagant in the highest degree and he cannot enter into the principles which influence it On the contrary when we abstain from present pleasure in order to secure greater pleasure to come when we act as if the remote object interested us as much as that which immediately presses upon the senses as our affections exactly correspond with his own he cannot fail to approve of our behaviour and as he knows from experience how few are capable of this selfcommand he looks upon our conduct with a considerable degree of wonder and admiration Hence arises that eminent esteem with which all men naturally regard a steady perseverance in the practice of frugality industry and application though directed to no other purpose than the acquisition of fortune The resolute firmness of the person who acts in this manner and in order to obtain a great though remote advantage not only gives up all present pleasures but endures the greatest labour both of mind and body necessarily commands our approbation That view of his interest and happiness which appears to regulate  his conduct exactly tallies with the idea which we naturally form of it There is the most perfect correspondence between his sentiments and our own and at the same time from our experience of the common weakness of human nature it is a correspondence which we could not reasonably have expected We not only approve therefore but in some measure admire his conduct and think it worthy of a considerable degree of applause It is the consciousness of this merited approbation and esteem which is alone capable of supporting the agent in this tenor of conduct The pleasure which we are to enjoy ten years hence interests us so little in comparison with that which we may enjoy to day the passion which the first excites is naturally so weak in comparison with that violent emotion which the second is apt to give occasion to that the one could never be any balance to the other unless it was supported by the sense of propriety by the consciousness that we merited the esteem and approbation of every body by acting in the one way and that we became the proper objects of their contempt and derision by behaving in the other  Humanity justice generosity and public spirit are the qualities most useful to others Wherein consists the propriety of humanity and justice has been explained upon a former occasion where it was shewn how much our esteem and approbation of those qualities depended upon the concord between the affections of the agent and those of the spectators  The propriety of generosity and public spirit is founded upon the same principle with that of justice Generosity is different from humanity Those two qualities which at first sight seem so nearly allied do not always belong to the same person Humanity is the virtue of a woman generosity of a man The fair sex who have commonly much more tenderness than ours have seldom so much generosity That women rarely make considerable donations is an observation of the civil law  Raro mulieres donare solent  Humanity consists merely in the exquisite fellowfeeling which the spectator entertains with the sentiments of the persons principally concerned so as to grieve for their sufferings to resent their injuries and rejoice at their good fortune  The most humane actions require no selfdenial no selfcommand no great exertion of the sense of propriety They consist only in doing what this exquisite sympathy would of its own accord prompt us to do But it is otherways with generosity We never are generous except when in some respect we prefer some other person to ourselves and sacrifice some great and important interest of our own to an equal interest of a friend or of a superior The man who gives up his pretensions to an office that was the great object of his ambition because he imagines that the services of another are better entitled to it the man who exposes his life to defend that of his friend which he judges to be of more importance neither of them act from humanity or because they feel more exquisitely what concerns that other person than what concerns themselves They both consider those opposite interests not in the light in which they naturally appear to themselves but in that in which they appear to others To every bystander the success or preservation of this other person may justly be more interesting than their own but it cannot be so to themselves When to the interest of this other person therefore they sacrifice their  own they accommodate themselves to the sentiments of the spectator and by an effort of magnanimity act according to those views of things which they feel must naturally occur to any third person The soldier who throws away his life in order to defend that of his officer would perhaps be but little affected by the death of that officer if it should happen without any fault of his own and a very small disaster which had befallen himself might excite a much more lively sorrow But when he endeavours to act so as to deserve applause and to make the impartial spectator enter into the principles of his conduct he feels that to every body but himself his own life is a trifle compared with that of his officer and that when he sacrifices the one to the other he acts quite properly and agreeably to what would be the natural apprehensions of every impartial bystander  It is the same case with the greater exertions of public spirit When a young officer exposes his life to acquire some inconsiderable addition to the dominions of his sovereign it is not because the acquisition of the new territory is to himself an object more desireable than the preservation of his own life To him his own life is of infinitely more value than the  conquest of a whole kingdom for the state which he serves But when he compares those two objects with one another he does not view them in the light in which they naturally appear to himself but in that in which they appear to the nation he fights for To them the success of the war is of the highest importance the life of a private person of scarce any consequence When he puts himself in their situation he immediately feels that he cannot be too prodigal of his blood if by shedding it he can promote so valuable a purpose In thus thwart  ng from a sense of duty and propriety the strongest of all natural propensities consists  he heroism of his conduct There is many  n honest Englishman who in his private station would be more seriously disturbed by the  oss of a guinea than by the national loss of Minorca who yet had it been in his power to defend that fortress would have sacrificed his  ife a thousand times rather than through his fault have let it fall into the hands of the enemy When the first Brutus led forth his own sons to a capital punishment because  hey had conspired against the rising liberty of Rome he sacrificed what if he had con  ulted his own breast only would appear to  be the stronger to the weaker affection Brutus ought naturally to have felt much  for the death of his own sons than for  that probably Rome could have suffered fro  the want of so great an example But h  viewed them not with the eyes of a father but with those of a Roman citizen He entered so thoroughly into the sentiments of  last character that he paid no regard to  tye by which he himself was connected with them and to a Roman citizen the  even of Brutus seemed contemptible  put into the balance with the smallest interest of Rome In these and in all other cases of this kind our admiration is not  much founded upon the utility as upon th  unexpected and on that account the grea  ▪ the noble and exalted propriety of such actions This utility when we come to  it bestows upon them undoubtedly a  beauty and upon that account still furthe  recommends them to our approbation  beauty however is chiefly perceived by men of reflection and speculation and is b  no means the quality which first recommends such actions to the natural sentime  of the bulk of mankind  It is to be observed that so far as the sen  iment of approbation arises from the percep  ion of this beauty of utility it has no refe  ence of any kind to the sentiments of others  f it was possible therefore that a person  hould grow up to manhood without any  ommunication with society his own actions  ight notwithstanding be agreeable or dis  greeable to him upon account of their ten  ency to his happiness or disadvantage He  ight perceive a beauty of this kind in pru  ence temperance and good conduct and a  eformity in the opposite behaviour He  ight view his own temper and character  ith that sort of satisfaction with which we  onsider a well contrived machine in the  case or with that sort of distaste and  ssatisfaction with which we regard a very  kward and clumsy contrivance in the other  these perceptions however are meerly  matter of taste and have all the feebleness  delicacy of that species of perceptions  on the justness of which what is properly  taste is founded they probably would  be much attended to by one in this  and miserable condition Even though  ey should occur to him they would by no  eans have the same effect upon him antecedent  to his connection with society which they would have in consequence of that connection He would not be cast down with inward shame at the thought of this deformity nor would he be elevated with secret triumph of mind from the consciousness of the contrary beauty He would not ex  lt from the notion of deserving reward in the one case nor tremble from the suspicion of meriting punishment in the other All such sentiments suppose the idea of some other being who is the natural judge of the person that feels them and it is only by sympathy with the decisions of this arbiter of his conduct that he can conceive either the triumph of selfapplause or the shame of selfcondemnation  PART V Of the INFLUENCE of CUSTOM and FASHION upon the sentiments of moral approbation and disapprobation  SECT I Of the Influence of custom and fashion upon our notions of beauty and deformity  THERE are other principles besides those already enumerated which have a considerable influence upon the moral sentiments of mankind and are the chief causes of the many irregular and discordant opinions which prevail in different ages and nations concerning what is blameable or praise worthy These principles are custom and fashion principles which extend their dominion over our judgments concerning beauty of every kind  When two objects have frequently been seen together the imagination acquires a habit of passing easily from the one to the other If the first appears we lay our account that the second is to follow Of their own accord  they put us in mind of one another and the attention glides easily along them Tho' independent of custom there should be no real beauty in their union yet when custom has thus connected them together we feel an impropriety in their separation The one we think is aukward when it appears without its usual companion We miss something which we expected to find and the habitual arangement of our ideas is disturbed by the disappointment A suit of cloaths for example seems to want something if they are without the most insignificant ornament which usually accompanies them and we find a meanness or aukwardness in the absence even of a haunch button When there is any natural propriety in the union custom increases our sense of it and makes a different arangement appear still more disagreeable than it would otherwise seem to be Those who have been accustomed to see things in a good taste are more disgusted by whatever is clumsy or aukward Where the conjunction is improper custom either diminishes or takes away altogether our sense of the impropriety Those who have been accustomed to slovenly disorder lose all sense of neatness or elegance The modes of furniture or dress  which seem ridiculous to strangers give no offence to the people who are used to them  Fashion is different from custom or rather is a particular species of it That is not the fashion which every body wears but which those wear who are of a high rank or character The graceful the easy and commanding manners of the great joined to the usual richness and magnificence of their dress give a grace to the very form which they happen to bestow upon it As long as they continue to use this form it is connected in our imaginations with the idea of something that is genteel and magnificent and tho' in itself it should be indifferent it seems on account of this relation to have something about it that is genteel and magnificent too As soon as they drop it it loses all the grace which it had appeared to possess before and being now used only by the inferior ranks of people seems to have something of their meanness and aukwardness  Dress and furniture are allowed by all the world to be entirely under the dominion of custom and fashion The influence of those principles however is by no means confined to so narrow a sphere but extends itself to whatever is in any respect the object  of taste to music to poetry to architecture The modes of dress and furniture are continually changing and that fashion appearing ridiculous today which was admired five years ago we are experimentally convinced that it owed its vogue chiefly or entirely to custom and fashion Cloaths and furniture are not made of very durable materials A well fancied coat is done in a twelve month and cannot continue longer to propagate as the fashion that form according to which it was made The modes of furniture change less rapidly than those of dress because furniture is commonly more durable In five or six years however it generally undergoes an entire revolution and every man in his own time sees the fashion in this respect change many different ways The productions of the other arts are much more lasting and when happily imagined may continue to propagate the fashion of their make for a much longer time A well contrived building may endure many centuries a beautiful air may be delivered down by a sort of tradition thro' many successive generations A well written poem may last as long as the world and all of them continue for ages together to  give the vogue to that particular stile to that particular taste or manner according to which each of them was composed Few men have an opportunity of seeing in their own times the fashion in any of these arts change very considerably Few men have so much experience and acquaintance with the different modes which have obtained in remote ages and nations as to be thoroughly reconciled to them or to judge with impartiality between them and what takes place in their own age and country Few men therefore are willing to allow that custom or fashion have much influence upon their judgments concerning what is beautiful or otherwise in the productions of any of those arts but imagine that all the rules which they think ought to be observed in each of them are founded upon reason and nature not upon habit or prejudice A very little attention however may convince them of the contrary and satisfy them that the influence of custom and fashion over dress and furniture is not more absolute than over architecture poetry and music  Can any reason for example be assigned why the Doric capital should be appropriated to a pillar whose height is equal to eight diameters  the Jonic volute to one of nine▪ and the Corinthian foliage to one of ten The propriety of each of those appropriations can be founded upon nothing but habit and custom The eye having been used to see a particular proportion connected with a particular ornament would be offended if they were not joined together Each of the five orders has its peculiar ornaments which cannot be changed for any other without giving offence to all those who know any thing of the rules of architecture According to some architects indeed such is the exquisite judgment with which the antients have assigned to each order its proper ornaments that no others can be found which are equally suitable It seems however a little difficult to be conceived that these forms tho' no doubt extremely agreeable should be the only forms which can suit those proportions o  that there should not be five hundred others which antecedent to established custom would have fitted them equally well When custom however has established particular rules of building provided they are not absolutely unreasonable it is absurd to think of altering them for others which are only equally good or even for others which in  point of elegance and beauty have naturally some little advantage over them A man would be ridiculous who should appear in public with a suit of cloaths quite different from those which are commonly worn tho' the new dress should in itself be ever so graceful or convenient And there seems to be an absurdity of the same kind in ornamenting a house after a quite different manner from that which custom and fashion have prescribed tho' the new ornaments should  n themselves be somewhat superior to the common ones  According to the antient rhetoricians a cer  ain measure of verse was by nature appro  riated to each particular species of writing  s being naturally expressive of that charac  er sentiment or passion which ought to  redominate in it One verse they said was  for grave and another for gay works which could not they thought be inter  hanged without the greatest impropriety The experience of modern times however  eems to contradict this principle tho' in it  elf it would appear to be extremely pro  able What is the burlesque verse in eng  sh is the heroic verse in French The tragedies  of Racine and the Henriad of Voltaire are in the same verse with  Thus said to my lady the knight full of care  The burlesque verse in French on the contrary is pretty much the same with the heroic verse of ten syllables in English Custom has made the one nation associate the ideas of gravity sublimity and seriousness to that measure which the other has connected with whatever is gay flippant and ludicrous Nothing would appear more absurd in English than a tragedy written in the Alexandri  verses of the French or in French than a work of the same kind in verses of ten syllables  An eminent artist will bring about a considerable change in the established modes of each of those arts and introduce a new fashion of writing music or architecture As the dress of an agreeable man of high rank recommends itself and how peculiar and fantastical soever comes soon to be admired and imitated so the excellencies of an eminent master recommend his peculiarities and his manner becomes the fashionable stile in the art which he practises The taste of the Italians in music and architecture has within these fifty years undergone a considerable  change from imitating the peculiarities of some eminent masters in each of those arts Seneca is accused by Quintilian of having corrupted the taste of the Romans and of having introduced a frivolous prettiness in the room of majestic reason and masculine eloquence Sallust and Tacitus have by others been charged with the same accusation tho' in a different manner They gave reputation it is pretended to a stile which tho' in the highest degree concise elegant expressive and even poetical wanted however ease simplicity and nature and was evidently the production of the most laboured and studied affectation How many great qualities must that writer possess who can thus render his very faults agreeable After the praise of refining the taste of a nation the highest eulogy perhaps which can be bestowed upon any author is to say that he corrupted it In our own language Mr Pope and Dr Swift have each of them introduced a manner different from what was practised before into all works that are written in Rhyme the one in long verses the other in short The quaintness of Butler has given place to the plainness of Swift The rambling freedom of Dryden  and the correct but often tedious and prosaic languor of Addison are no longer the objects of imitation but all long verses are now written after the manner of the nervous precision of Mr Pope  Neither is it only over the productions of the arts that custom and fashion exert their dominion They influence our judgments in the same manner with regard to the beauty of natural objects What various and opposite forms are deemed beautiful in different species of things The proportions which are admired in one animal are altogether different from those which are esteemed in another Every class of things has its own peculiar conformation which is approved of and has a beauty of its own distinct from that of every other species It is upon this account that a learned Jesuit father Buffier has determined that the beauty of every object consists in that form and colour which is most usual among things of that particular sort to which it belongs Thus in the human form the beauty of each feature lies in a certain middle equally removed from a variety of other forms that are ugly A beautiful nose for example is one that is neither very long nor very short neither  very streight nor very crooked but a sort of middle among all these extremes and less different from any one of them than all of them are from one another It is the form which nature seems to have aimed at in them all which however she deviates from in a great variety of ways▪ and very seldom hits exactly but to which all those deviations still bear a very strong resemblance When a number of drawings are made after one pattern tho' they may all miss it in some respects yet they will all resemble it more than they resemble one another the general character of the pattern will run through them all the most singular and odd will be those that are most wide of it and tho' very few will copy it exactly yet the most accurate delineations will bear a greater resemblance to the most careless than the careless ones will bear to one another In the same manner in each species of creatures what is most beautiful bears the strongest characters of the general fabric of the species and has the strongest resemblance to the greater part of  he individuals with which it is classed Monsters on the contrary or what is perfectly deformed are always most singular and odd  nd have the least resemblance to the generality  of that species to which they belong And thus the beauty of each species though in one sense the rarest of all things because few individuals hit this middle form exactly yet in another is the most common because all the deviations from it resemble it more than they resemble one another The most customary form therefore is in each species of things according to him the most beautiful And hence it is that a certain practice and experience in contemplating each species of objects is requisite before we can judge of its beauty or know wherein the middle and most usual form consists The nicest judgment concerning the beauty of the human species will not help us to judge of that of flowers or horses or any other species of things It is for the same reason that in different climates and where different customs and ways of living take place as the generality of any species receives a different conformation from those circumstances so different ideas of its beauty prevail The beauty of a moorish is not exactly the same with that of an English horse What different ideas are formed in different nations concerning the beauty of the human shape and countenance A fair complexion is a shocking deformity  upon the coast of Guinea Thick lips and a flat nose are a beauty In some nations long ears that hang down upon the shoulders are the objects of universal admiration In China if a lady's foot is so large as to be fit to walk upon she is regarded as a monster of uggliness Some of the savage nations in NorthAmerica tie four boards round the heads of their children and thus squeeze them while the bones are tender and gristly into a form that is almost perfectly square Europeans are astonished at the absurd barbarity of this practice to which some missionaries have imputed the singular stupidity of those nations among whom it prevails But when they condemn those savages they do not reflect that the ladies in Europe had till within these very few years been endeavouring for near a century past to squeeze the beautiful roundness of their natural shape into a square form of the same kind And that notwithstanding the many distortions and diseases which this practice was known to occasion custom had rendered it agreeable among some of the most civilized nations which perhaps the world ever beheld  Such is the system of this learned and ingenious father concerning the nature of  beauty of which the whole charm according to him would thus seem to arise from its falling in with the habits which custom had impressed upon the imagination with regard to things of each particular kind I cannot however be induced to believe that our sense even of external beauty is founded altogether on custom The utility of any form its fitness for the useful purposes for which it was intended evidently recommends it and renders it agreeable to us independent of custom Certain colours are more agreeable than others and give more delight to the eye even the first time it ever beholds them A smooth surface is more agreeable than a rough one Variety is more pleasing than a tedious undiversified uniformity Connected variety in which each new appearance seems to be introduced by what went before it and in which all the adjoining parts seem to have some natural relation to one another is more agreeable than a disjointed and disorderly assemblage of unconnected objects But tho' I cannot admit that custom is the sole principle of beauty yet I can so far allow the truth of this ingenious system as to grant that there is scarce any one external form so  beautiful as to please if quite contrary to custom and unlike whatever we have been used to in that particular species of things Or so deformed as not to be agreeable if custom uniformly supports it and habituates us to see it in every single individual of the kind  PART VI  SECTION II Of the influence of custom and fashion upo  moral sentiments  SINCE our sentiments concerning beau  ty of every kind are so much influen  ced by custom and fashion it cannot be ex  pected that those concerning the beauty  conduct should be entirely exempted fro  the dominion of those principles Their i  fluence here however seems to be muc  less than it is every where else There  perhaps no form of external objects  absurd and fantastical soever to which custo  will not reconcile us or which fashion  not render even agreeable But the ch  racters and conduct of a Nero or a  us are what no custom will ever  us to what no fashion will ever render agre  able  but the one will always be the object of dread and hatred the other of scorn and derision The principles of the imagination▪ upon which our sense of beauty depends are of a very nice and delicate nature and may easily be altered by habit and education But the sentiments of moral approbation and disapprobation are founded on the strongest and most vigorous passions of human nature and tho' they may be somewhat warpt cannot be entirely perverted  But though the influence of custom and fashion upon moral sentiments is not altogether so great it is however perfectly simi  ar to what it is every where else When custom and fashion coincide with the natural principles of right and wrong they heighten  he delicacy of our sentiments and increase our abhorrence for every thing that approaches to evil Those who have been educated  n what is really good company not in what  s commonly called such who have been  ccustomed to see nothing in the persons whom they esteemed and lived with but  ustice modesty humanity and good order  re more shocked with whatever seems to be  nconsistent with the rules which those vir  ues prescribe Those on the contrary who  have had the misfortune to be brought up amidst violence licentiousness falshood and injustice lose though not all sense of the impropriety of such conduct yet all sense of its dreadful enormity and of the vengeance and punishment that is due to it They have been familiarized with it from their infancy custom has rendered it habitual to them and they are very apt to regard it as what is called the way of the world something which either may or must be practiced to hinder us from being the dupes of our own integrity  Fashion too will sometimes give reputation to a certain degree of disorder and on the contrary discountenance qualities which deserve esteem In the reign of Charles II a degree of licentiousness was deemed the characteristic of a liberal education It was connected according to the notions of those times with generosity sincerity magnanimity loyalty and proved that the person who acted in this manner was a gentleman and not a puritan severity of manners and regularity of conduct on the other hand were altogether unfashionable and were connected in the imagination of that age with cant cunning hypocrisy and low manners To superficial minds the vices of the great  seem at all times agreeable They connect them not only with the splendour of fortune but with many superior virtues which they ascribe to their superiors with the spirit of freedom and independency with frankness generosity humanity and politeness The virtues of the inferior ranks of people on the contrary their parsimonious frugality their painful industry and rigid adherence to rules seem to them mean and disagreeable They connect them both with the meanness of the station to which those qualities commonly belong and with many great vices which they suppose usually accompany them such as an abject cowardly illnatured lying pilfering disposition  The objects with which men in the different professions and states of life are conversant being very different and habituating them to very different passions naturally form in them very different characters and manners We expect in each rank and profession a degree of those manners which experience has taught us belong to it But as in each species of things we are particularly pleased with the middle conformation which in every part and feature agrees most exactly with the general standard  that nature seems to have established for things of that kind so in each rank or if I may say so in each species of men we are particularly pleased if they have neither too much nor too little of the character which usually accompanies their particular condition and situation A man we say should look like his trade and profession yet the pedantry of every profession is disagreeable The different periods of life have for the same reason different manners assigned to them We expect in old age that gravity and sedateness which its infirmities its long experience and its wo  out sensibility seem to render both natural and respectable and we lay our account to find in youth that sensibility that gaiety and sprightly vivacity which experience teaches us to expect from the lively impressions that all interesting objects are apt to make upon the tender and unpracticed senses of that early period of life Each of those two ages however may easily have too much of the peculiarities which belong to it The flirting levity of youth and the immovable insensibility of old age are equally disagreeable The young according to the common saying are most agreeable when in their behaviour  there is something of the manners of the old and the old when they retain something of the gaiety of the young Either of them however may easily have too much of the manners of the other The extreme coldness and dull formality which are pardoned in old age make youth ridiculous The levity the carelessness and the vanity which are indulged in youth render old age contemptible  The peculiar character and manners which we are led by custom to appropriate to each rank and profession have sometimes perhaps a propriety independent of custom and are what we should approve of for their own sakes if we took into consideration all the different circumstances which naturally affect those in each different state of life The propriety of a person's behaviour depends not upon its suitableness to any one circumstance of his situation but to all the circumstances which when we bring his case home to ourselves we feel should na  urally call upon his attention If he appears  o be so much occupied by any one of them  s entirely to neglect the rest we disapprove of his conduct as something which we cannot  entirely go along with because not perfectly adjusted to all the circumstances of his situation yet perhaps the emotion he expresses for the object which principally interests him does not exceed what we should entirely sympathize with and approve of in one whose attention was not required by any other thing A parent in private life might upon the loss of an only son express without blame a degree of grief and tenderness which would be unpardonable in a general at the head of an army when glory and the public safety demanded so great a part of his attention As different objects ought upon common occasions to occupy the attention of men of different professions so different passions ought naturally to become habitual to them and when we bring home to ourselves their situation in this particular respect we must be sensible that every occurrence should naturally affect them more or less according as the emotion which it excites coincides or disagrees with the fixt habit and temper of their minds We cannot expect the same sensibility to the gay pleasures and amusements of life in a clergyman which we lay our account with in an officer The man whose peculiar occupation it is to keep  the world in mind of that awful futurity which awaits them who is to anounce what may be the fatal consequences of every deviation from the rules of duty and who is himself to set the example of the most exact conformity is the messenger of tidings which cannot in propriety be delivered either with levity or indifference His mind is continually occupied with what is too grand and solemn to leave any room for the impressions of those frivolous objects which fill up the attention of the dissipated and the gay We readily feel therefore that independent of custom there is a propriety in the manners which custom has allotted to this profession and that nothing can be more suitable to the character of a clergyman than that grave that austere and abstracted severity which we are habituated to expect in his behaviour These reflections are so very obvious that there is scarce any man so inconsiderate as not at some time to have made them and to have accounted to himself in this manner for his approbation of the usual character of this order  The foundation of the customary character of some other professions is not so obvious and our approbation of it is founded entirely  in habit without being either confirmed or enlivened by any reflections of this kind We are led by custom for example to annex the character of gaiety levity and sprightly freedom as well as of some degree of dissipation to the military profession yet if we were to consider what mood or tone of temper would be most suitable to this situation we should be apt to determine perhaps that the most serious and thoughtful turn of mind would best become these whose lives are continually exposed to uncommon danger and who should therefore be more constantly occupied with the thoughts of death and its consequences than other men It is this very circumstance however which is not improbably the occasion why the contrary turn of mind prevail  so much among men of this profession It requires so great an effort to conquer the fear of death when we survey it with steadiness and attention that those who are constantly exposed to it find it easier to turn away their thoughts from it altogether to wrap themselves up in careless security and indifference and to plunge themselves for this purpose into every sort of amusement and dissipation▪ A camp is not the element of a thoughtful  or a melancholy man persons of that cast  ndeed are often abundantly determined  nd are capable by a great effort of going  n with inflexible resolution to the most un  voidable death But to be exposed to con  inual though less imminent danger to be obliged to exert for a long time a degree  f this effort exhausts and depresses the mind and renders it incapable of all happi  ess and enjoyment The gay and careless who have occasion to make no effort at all who fairly resolve never to look before them  ut to lose in continual pleasures and amusements all anxiety about their situation more  asily support such circumstances Whenever  y any peculiar circumstances an officer has no  eason to lay his account with being exposed  o any uncommon danger he is very apt to  ose the gaiety and dissipated thoughtlesness  f his character The captain of a city guard a  commonly as sober careful and penurious  n animal as the rest of his fellow citizens A long peace is for the same reason very  pt to diminish the difference between the  ivil and the military character The ordi  ary situation however of men of this pro  ession renders gaiety and a degree of dissi  ation so much their usual character and  custom has in our imagination so strongly connected this character with this state of life that we are very apt to despise any man whose peculiar humour or situation renders him incapable of acquiring it We laugh at the grave and careful faces of a city guard which so little resemble those of their profession They themselves seem often to be ashamed of the regularity of their own manners and not to be out of the fashion of their trade are fond of affecting that levity which is by no means natural to them Whatever is the deportment which we have been accustomed to see in a respectable order of men it comes to be so associated in our imagination with that order that whenever we see the one we lay our account that we are to meet with the other and when disappointed miss something which we expected to find We are embarassed and put to a stand and know not how to address ourselves to a character which plainly affects to be of a different species from those with which we should have been disposed to class it  The different situations of different ages and countries are apt in the same manner to give different characters to the generality of those who live in them and their sentiments  concerning the particular degree of each quality that is either blameable or praiseworthy vary according to that degree which is usual in their own country and in their own times That degree of politeness which would be highly esteemed perhaps would be thought effeminate adulation in Russia would be regarded as rudeness and barbarism at the court of France That degree of order and frugality which in a Polish nobleman would be considered as excessive parsimony would be regarded as extravagance in a citizen of Amsterdam Every age and country look upon that degree of each quality which is commonly to be met with in those who are esteemed among themselves as the golden mean of that particular talent or virtue And as this varies according as their different circumstances render different qualities more or less habitual to them their sentiments concerning the exact propriety of character and behaviour vary accordingly  Among civilized nations the virtues which are founded upon humanity are more cultivated than those which are founded upon selfdenial and the command of the passions Among rude and barbarous nations it is quite otherwise the virtues of selfdenial are more cultivated than  those of humanity The general security and happiness which prevail in ages of civility and politeness afford little exercise to the contempt of danger to patience in enduring labour hunger and pain Poverty may easily be avoided and the contempt of it therefore almost ceases to be a virtue The abstinence from pleasure becomes less necessary and the mind is more at liberty to unbend itself and to indulge its natural inclinations in all those particular respects  Among savages and barbarians it is quite otherwise Every savage undergoes a sort of Spartan discipline and by the necessity of his situation is inured to every sort of hardship He is in continual danger He is often exposed to the greatest extremities of hunger and frequently dies of pure want His circumstances not only habituate him to every sort of distress but teach him to give way to none of the passions which that distress is apt to excite He can expect from his countrymen no sympathy or indulgence for such weakness Before we can feel much for others we must in some measure be at ease ourselves If our own misery pinches us very severely we have no leisure to attend to that of our neighbour And all savages are too much occupied with their own wants  and necessities to give much attention to those of another person A savage therefore whatever be the nature of his distress expects no sympathy from those about him and disdains upon that account to expose himself by allowing the least weakness to escape him His passions how furious and violent soever are never permitted to disturb the serenity of his countenance or the composure of his conduct and behaviour The savages in North America we are told assume upon all occasions the greatest indifference and would think themselves degraded if they should ever appear in any respect to be overcome either by love or grief or resentment Their magnanimity and selfcommand in this respect are almost beyond the conception of Europeans In a country in which all men are upon a level with regard to rank and fortune it might be expected that the mutual inclinations of the two parties should be the only thing considered in marriages and should be indulged without any sort of controul This however is the country in which all marriages without exception are made up by the parents and in which a young man would think himself disgraced for ever if he shewed the least  preference of one woman above another or did not express the most compleat indifference both about the time when and the person to whom he was to be married The weakness of love which is so much indulged in ages of humanity and politeness is regarded among savages as the most unpardonable effeminacy Even after the marriage the two parties seem to be ashamed of a connection which is founded upon so sordid a necessity They do not live together They see one another by stealth only They both continue to dwell in the house of their respective fathers and the open cohabitation of the two sexes which is permitted without blame in all other countries is here considered as the most indecent and unmanly sensuality Nor is it only over this agreeable passion that they exert this absolute selfcommand They often bear in the fight of all their countrymen with injuries reproach and the grossest insults with the appearance of the greatest insensibility and without expressing the smallest resentment When a savage is made prisoner of war and receives as is usual the sentence of death from his conquerors he hears it without expressing any  emotion and afterwards submits to the most dreadful torments without ever bemoaning himself or discovering any other passion but contempt of his enemies While he is hung by the shoulders over a slow fire he derides his tormentors and tells them with how much more ingenuity he himself had tormented such of their countrymen as had fallen into his hands After he has been scorched and burnt and lacerated in all the most tender and sensible parts of his body for several hours together he is often allowed in order to prolong his misery a short respite and is taken down from the stake he employs this interval in talking upon all indifferent subjects inquires after the news of the country and seems indifferent about nothing but his own situation The spectators express the same insensibility the sight of so horrible an object seems to make no  mpression upon them they scarce look at the prisoner except when they lend a hand to torment him At other times they smoke tobacco and amuse themselves with any common object as if no such matter was go  ng on Every savage is said to prepare himself from his earliest youth for the dreadful end He composes for this purpose what  they call the song of death a song which he is to sing when he has fallen into the hands of his enemies and is expiring under the tortures which they inflict upon him It consists of insults upon his tormentors and expresses the highest contempt of death and pain He sings this song upon all extraordinary occasions when he goes out to war when he meets his enemies in the field or whenever he has a mind to show that he has familiarised his imagination to the most dreadful misfortunes and that no human event can daunt his resolution or alter his purpose The same contempt of death and torture prevails among all other savage nations There is not a negro from the coast of Africa who does not in this respect possess a degree of magnanimity which the soul of his sordid master is scarce capable of conceiving Fortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind than when she subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the jails of Europe to wretches who possess the virtues neither of the countries which they come from nor of those which they go to and whose levity brutality and baseness so justly expose them to the contempt of the vanquished  This heroic and unconquerable firmness which the custom and education of his country demand of every savage is not required of those who are brought up to live in civilized societies If these last complain when they are in pain if they grieve when they are in distress if they allow themselves either to be overcome by love or to be discomposed by anger they are easily pardoned Such weaknesses are not apprehended to affect the essential parts of their character As long as they do not allow themselves to be transported to do any thing contrary to justice or humanity they lose but little reputation tho' the serenity of their countenance or the composure of their discourse and behaviour should be somewhat ruffled and disturbed A humane and polished people who have more sensibility to the passions of others can more readily enter into an animated and passionate behaviour and can more easily pardon some  ittle excess The person principally concerned is sensible of this and being as  ured of the equity of his judges indulges himself in stronger expressions of pas  ion and is less afraid of exposing himself to  heir contempt by the violence of his emo  ions We can venture to express more emotion  in the presence of a friend than in that of a stranger because we expect more indulgence from the one than from the other And in the same manner the rules of decorum among civilized nations admit of a more animated behaviour than is approved of among barbarians The first converse together with the openness of friends the second with the reserve of strangers The emotion and vivacity with which the French and Italians the two most polished nations upon the continent express themselves on occasions that are at all interesting surprize at first those strangers who happen to be travelling among them and who having been educated among a people of duller sensibility cannot enter into this passionate behaviour of which they have never seen any examples in their own country A young French nobleman will weep in the presence of the whole court upon being refused a regiment An Italian says the abbot Dû Bos expresses more emotion upon being condemned in a fine of twenty shillings than an Englishman upon receiving the sentence of death Cicero in the times of the highest Roman politeness could without degrading himself weep with all the bitterness of sorrow in the sight of the whole senate and the  whole people as it is evident he must have done in the end of almost every oration The orators of the earlier and ruder ages of Rome could not probably consistent with the manners of the times have expressed themselves with so much emotion It would have been regarded I suppose as a violation of nature and propriety in the Scipio's in the Lelius's and in the elder Cato to have exposed so much tenderness to the view of the public Those antient warriors could express themselves with order gravity and good judgment but are said to have been strangers to that sublime and passionate eloquence which was first introduced into Rome not many years before the birth of Cicero by the two Gracchi by Crassus and by Sulpitius This animated eloquence which has been long practised with or without success both in France and Italy is but just beginning to be introduced into England So wide is the difference between the degrees of selfcommand which are required in civilized and in barbarous nations And by such different standards do they  udge of the propriety of behaviour  This difference gives occasion to many others that are not less essential A polished people being accustomed to give way in some measure  to the movements of nature become frank open and sincere Barbarians on the contrary being obliged to smother and conceal the appearance of every passion necessarily acquire the habits of falshood and dissimulation It is observed by all those who have been conversant with savage nations whether in Asia Africa or America that they are all equally impenetrable and that when they have a mind to conceal the truth no examination is capable of drawing it from them They cannot be trepanned by the most artful questions The torture itself is incapable of making them confess any thing which they have no mind to tell The passions of a savage too tho' they never express themselves by any outward emotion but lye concealed in the breast of the sufferer are notwithstanding all mounted to the highest pitch of fury Tho' he seldom shows any symptoms of anger yet his vengeance when he comes to give way to it is always sanguinary and dreadful The least affront drives him to despair His countenance and discourse indeed are still sober and composed and express nothing but the most perfect tranquility of mind But his actions are often the most furious and violent Among the  NorthAmericans it is not uncommon for persons of the tenderest age and more fearful sex to drown themselves upon receiving only a slight reprimand from their mothers and this too without expressing any passion or saving any thing except  you shall no longer have a daughter  In civilized nations the passions of men are not commonly so furious or so desperate They are often clamorous and noisy but are seldom very hurtful and seem frequently to aim at no other satisfaction but that of convincing the spectator that they are in the right to be so much moved and of procuring his sympathy and approbation  All these effects of custom and fashion however upon the moral sentiments of mankind are inconsiderable in comparison of those which they give occasion to in some other cases and it is not concerning the general stile of character and behaviour that those principles produce the greatest perversion of judgment but concerning the propriety or impropriety of particular usages  The different manners which custom teaches us to approve of in the different professions and states of life do not concern things of the greatest importance We expect  truth and justice from an old man as well as from a young from a clergyman as well as from an officer and it is in matters of smaller moment only that we look for the distinguishing marks of their respective characters With regard to these too there is often some unobserved circumstance which if it was attended to would show us that independent of custom there was a propriety in the character which custom had taught us to allot to each profession We cannot complain therefore in this case that the perversion of natural sentiment is very great Tho' the manners of different nations require different degrees of the same quality in the character which they think worthy of esteem yet the worst that can be said to happen even here is that the duties of one virtue are sometimes extended so as to encroach a little upon the precincts of some other The rustic hospitality that is in fashion among the Poles encroaches perhaps a little upon oeconomy and good order and the frugality that is esteemed in Holland upon generosity and goodfellowship The hardiness demanded of savages diminishes their humanity and perhaps the delicate sensibility required in civilized nations sometimes  destroys the masculine firmness of the character In general the stile of manners which takes place in any nation may commonly upon the whole be said to be that which is most suitable to its situation Hardiness is the character most suitable to the circumstances of a savage sensibility to those of one who lives in a very civilized society Even here therefore we cannot complain that the moral sentiments of men are very grossly perverted  It is not therefore in the general stile of conduct or behaviour that custom authorizes the widest departure from what is the natural propriety of action With regard to particular usages its influence is often much more destructive of good morals and it is capable of establishing as lawful and blameless particular actions which shock the plainest principles of right and wrong  Can there be greater barbarity for example than to hurt an infant it's helplessness  t's innocence it's amiableness call forth the compassion even of an enemy and not to  pare that tender age is regarded as the most furious effort of an enraged and cruel conqueror What then should we imagine must  be the heart of a parent who could injure that weakness which even a furious enemy is afraid to violate yet the exposition that is the murder of new born infants was a practice allowed of in almost all the states of Greece even among the polite and civilized Athenians and whenever the circumstances of the parent rendered it inconvenient to bring up the child to abandon it to hunger or to wild beasts was regarded without blame or censure This practice had probably begun in times of the most savage barbarity The imagination  of men had been first made familiar with it in that earliest period of society and the uniform continuance of the custom had hindered them afterwards from perceiving it's enormity We find at this day that  practice prevails among all savage nations and in that rudest and lowest state of society  is undoubtedly more pardonable than in any other The extreme indigence of a savage is often such that he himself is frequently exposed to the greatest extremity of hunger he often dies of pure want and it is frequently impossible for him to support both himse  and his child We cannot wonder therefore that in this case he should abandon it  who in flying from an enemy whom it  mpossible to resist should throw down his  nfant because it retarded his flight would  urely be excusable since by attempting to  ave it he could only hope for the consolation  f dying along with it That in this state of  ociety therefore a parent should be allowed  o judge whether he can bring up his child  ught not to surprize us so greatly In the  atter ages of Greece however the same  hing was permitted from views of remote in  erest or conveniency which could by no  eans excuse it Uninterrupted custom had  y this time so thoroughly authorized the  ractice that not only the loose maxims of  he world tollerated this barbarous preroga  ve but even the doctrine of philosophers which ought to have been more just and ac  urate was led away by the established cus  om and upon this as upon many other occa  ons instead of censuring supported the  orrible abuse by far fetched considerations of  ublick utility Aristotle talks of it as of  hat the magistrate ought upon many occa  ons to encourage The humane Plato is of  he same opinion and with all that love of  ankind which seems to animate all his writ  gs no where marks this practice with dis  probation When custom can give sanction  to so dreadful a violation of humanity we may well imagine that there is scarce any particular practice so gross which it cannot authorize Such a thing we hear men every day saying is commonly done and they seem to think this a sufficient apology for what in itself is the most unjust and unreasonable conduct  There is an obvious reason why custom should never pervert our sentiments with regard to the general stile and character of conduct and behaviour in the same degree as with regard to the propriety or unlawfullness of particular usages There never can be any such custom No society could subsist a moment in which the usual strain of mens conduct and behaviour was of a piece with the horrible practice I just now mentioned  PART VII Of Systems of MORAL PHILOSOPHY  SECT I Of the questions which ought to be examined in a theory of moral sentiments  IF we examine the most celebrated and remarkable of the different theories which have been given concerning the nature and origin of our moral sentiments we shall find that almost all of them coincide with some part or other of that which I have been endeavouring to give an account of and that  f every thing which has already been said be fully considered we shall be at no loss to explain what was the view or aspect of nature which led each particular author to form his particular system From some one or other of those principles which I have been endeavouring to unfold every system of morality that ever had any reputation in the world has perhaps ultimately been derived As they are all of them in this respect founded  upon natural principles they are all of them in some measure in the right But as many of them are derived from a partial and imperfect view of nature there are many of them too in some respects in the wrong  In treating of the principles of morals there are two questions to be considered First wherein does virtue consist or what is the tone of temper and tenor of conduct which constitutes the excellent and praiseworthy character the character which is the natural object of esteem honour and approbation and secondly by what power or faculty i  the mind is it that this character whatever it be is recommended to us or in other words how and by what means does it come to pass that the mind prefers one tenor of conduct to another denominates the one right and the other wrong considers the one as the object of approbation honour and reward and the other of blame censure and punishment  We examine the first question when we consider whether virtue consists in benevolence as Dr Hutcheson imagines or in acting suitably to the different relations we stand in as Dr Clark supposes or in the wise and  rudent pursuit of our own real and solid happiness as has been the opinion of others  We examine the second question when we consider whether the virtuous character whatever it consists in be recommended to  s by selflove which makes us perceive that his character both in ourselves and others  ends most to promote our own private inter  st or by reason which points out to us the  ifference between one character and another  n the same manner as it does that between  ruth and falshood or by a peculiar power  f perception called a moral sense which his virtuous character gratifies and pleases  s the contrary disgusts and displeases it or  ast of all by some other principle in human  ature such as a modification of sympathy  r the like  I shall begin with considering the systems which have been formed concerning the  rst of these questions and shall proceed af  erwards to examine those concerning the  econd  SECT II Of the different accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue  INTRODUCTION  THE different accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue or of the temper of mind which constitutes the excellent and praiseworthy character may be reduced to three different classes According to some the virtuous temper of mind does not consist in any one species of affections but in the proper government and direction of all our affections which may be either virtuous or vitious according to the objects which they pursue and the degree of violence with which they pursue them According to these authors therefore virtue consists in propriety  According to others virtue consists in the judicious pursuit of our own private interest and happiness or in the proper government and direction of those selfish affections which aim solely at this end In the opinion of these  authors therefore virtue consists in prudence  Another set of authors make virtue consist in those affections only which aim at the happiness of others not in those which aim at our own According to them therefore disinterested benevolence is the only motive which can stamp upon any action the character of virtue  The character of virtue it is evident must either be ascribed indifferently to all our affections when under proper government and direction or it must be confined to some one class or division of them The great divi  ion of our affections is into the selfish and  he benevolent If the character of virtue  herefore cannot be ascribed indifferently to  ll our affections when under proper govern  ent and direction it must be confined either  o those which aim directly at our own pri  ate happiness or to those which aim di  ectly at that of others If virtue therefore  oes not consist in propriety it must consist  ither in prudence or in benevolence Be  des these three it is scarce possible to ima  ine that any other account can be given of  he nature of virtue I shall endeavour to  hereafter how all the other accounts  which are seemingly different from any of these coincide at bottom with some one or other of them  CHAP I Of those systems which make virtue  in propriety  ACCORDING to Plato to Aristotle and to Zeno virtue consists in the propriety of conduct or in the suitableness of the affection from which we act  the object which excites it  I In the system of Plato  See Plato de rep lib  the soul is considered as something like a little state or republick composed of three different faculties or orders  The first is the judging faculty the faculty which determines not only what are the proper means for attaining any end but  what ends are fit to be pursued and  degree of relative value we ought to  upon each This faculty Plato called as  is very properly called reason and cons  dered it as what had a right to be the govern  ing  principle of the whole Under this appellation it is evident he comprehended not only that faculty by which we judge of truth and falshood but that by which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of desires and affections  The different passions and appetites the natural subjects of this ruling principle but which are so apt to rebel against their master  reduced to two different classes or orders The first consisted of those passions which are  ounded in pride and resentment or in what  he schoolmen called the irascible part of the  oul ambition animosity the love of ho  our and the dread of shame the desire of  ictory superiority and revenge all those  assions in short which are supposed either  o arise from or to denote what by a meta  hor in our language we commonly call spi  t or natural fire The second consisted of  hose passions which are founded in the love  f pleasure or in what the schoolmen called  he concupiscible part of the soul It com  ehended all the appetites of the body the  of ease and security and of all sensual  ratifications  It rarely happens that we break in upon that plan of conduct which the governing principle prescribes and which in all our cool hours we had laid down to ourselves as what was most proper for us to pursue but when prompted by one or other of those two different sets of passions either by ungovernable ambition and resentment or by the importunate sollicitations of present ease and pleasure But tho' these two orders of passions are so apt to mislead us they are still considered as necessary parts of human nature The first having been given to defend us against injuries to assert our rank and dignity in the world to make us aim at what is noble and honourable and to make  s distinguish those who act in the same manner the second to provide for the suppo  and necessities of the body  In the strength acuteness and perfection  the governing principle was placed the essential virtue of prudence which according  Plato consisted in a just and clear discernment founded upon general and  ideas of the ends which were proper to  pursued and of the means which were pr  per for attaining them  When the first set of passions those of the irascible part of the soul had that degree of strength and firmness which enabled them under the direction of reason to despise all dangers in the pursuit of what was honourable and noble it constituted the virtue of fortitude and magnanimity This order of passions according to this system was of a more generous and noble nature than the other They were considered upon many occasions as the auxiliaries of reason to check and restrain the inferior and brutal appetites We are often angry at ourselves it was observed we often become the objects of our own resentment and indignation when the love of pleasure prompts us to do what we disapprove of and the irascible part of our na  ure is in this manner called in to assist the  ational against the concupiscible  When all those three different parts of our  ature were in perfect concord with one an  ther when neither the irascible nor concupi  cible passions ever aimed at any gratification which reason did not approve of and when  eason never commanded any thing but what  hese of their own accord were willing to  erform this happy composure this perfect  nd compleat harmony of soul constituted  that virtue which in their language is expressed by a word which we commonly translate temperance but which might more properly be translated good temper or sobriety and moderation of mind  Justice the last and greatest of the four cardinal virtues took place according to this system when each of those three faculties of the mind con  ined itself to it's proper office without attempting to encroach upon that of any other when reason directed and passion obeyed and when each passion performed its proper duty and exerted itself towards its proper object easily and without reluctance and with that degree of force and energy which was suitable to the value of what it pursued In this consisted that compleat virtue that perfect propriety of conduct which Plato after some of the antient Pythagoreans denominated Justice  The word it is to be observed which expresses justice in the Greek language has several different meanings and as the correspondent word in all other languages so far as I know has the same there must be some natural affinity among those various significations In one sense we are said to do justice to our neighbour when we abstain from doing  him any positive harm and do not directly hurt him either in his person or in his estate or in his reputation This is that justice which I have treated of above the observance of which may be extorted by force and the violation of which exposes to punishment In another sense we are said not to do justice to our neighbour unless we conceive for him all that love respect and esteem which his character his situation and his connection with ourselves render suitable and proper for us to feel and unless we act accordingly It is in this sense that we are said to do injustice to a man of merit who is connected with us tho' we abstain from hurting him in every respect if we do not exert ourselves to serve him and to place him in that situation in which the impartial spectator would be pleased to see him The first sense of the word coincides with what Aristotle and the Schoolmen call commutative  ustice and with what Grotius calls the  justitia expletrix  which consists in abstaining from what is anothers and in doing voluntarily whatever we can with propriety be forced to do The second sense of the word coincides with what some have called distributive  justice  The distributive justice of Aristotle is somewhat differe  It consists in the proper distribution of rewards from the publick stock of a community see Aristotle Ethic Nic l c  and with the  justitia attributri  of Grotius which consists in proper beneficence in the becoming use of what is our own and in the applying it to those purposes either of charity or generosity to which it is most suitable in our situation that it should be applied In this sense justice comprehends all the social virtues There is yet another sense in which the word justice is sometimes taken still more extensive than either of the former tho' very much akin to the last and which runs too so far as I know through all languages It is in this last sense that we are said to be unjust when we do not seem to value any particular object with that degree of esteem or to pursue it with that degree of ardour which to the impartial spectator it may appear to deserve or to be naturally fitted for exciting Thus we are said to do injustice to a poem or a picture when we do not admire them enough and we are said to do them more than justice when we admire them too much In the same manner we are said to do injustice to ourselves when we appear not to give sufficient attention  to any particular object of selfinterest In this last sense what is called justice means the same thing with exact and perfect propriety of conduct and behaviour and comprehends in it not only the offices of both commutative and distributive justice but of every other virtue of prudence of fortitude of temperance It is in this last sense that Plato evidently understands what he calls justice and which therefore according to him comprehends in it the perfection of every sort of virtue  Such is the account given by Plato of the nature of virtue or of that temper of mind which is the proper object of praise and approbation It consists according to him in that state of mind in which every faculty confines itsself within its proper sphere without encroaching upon that of any other and performs its proper office with that precise degree of strength and vigour which belongs to it His account it is evident coincides in every respect with what we have said above concerning the propriety of conduct  II Virtue  See Aristotle Ethic Nic l c et seq et l c et seq  according to Aristotle consists  in the habitual mediocrity of the affections according to right reason Every particular virtue according to him lies in a kind of middle between two opposite vices of which the one offends from being too much the other from being too little affected by a particular species of objects Thus the virtue of fortitude or courage lies in a middle between the opposite vices of cowardice and of presumptuous rashness of which the one offends from being too much and the other from being too little affected by the objects of fear Thus too the virtue of frugality lies in a middle between avarice and profusion of which the one consists in an excess the other in a defect of the proper attention to the objects of selfinterest Magnanimity in the same manner lies in a middle between the excess of arrogance and the defect of pusillanimity of which the one consists in too extravagant the other in too weak a sentiment of our own worth and dignity It is unnecessary to observe that this account of virtue corresponds too pretty exactly with what has been said above concerning the propriety and impropriety of conduct  According to Aristotle  See Aristotle Ethic Nic lib ii ch and  indeed virtue did not so much consist in those moderate and right affections as in the habit of this moderation In order to understand this it is to be observed that virtue may be considered either as the quality of an action or as the quality of a person Considered as the quality of an action it consists even according to Aristotle in the reasonable moderation of the affection from which the action proceeds whether this disposition be habitual to the person or not Considered as the quality of a person it consists in the habit of this reasonable moderation in it's having become the customary and usual disposition of the mind Thus the action which proceeds from an occasional fit of generosity is undoubtedly a generous action but the man who performs it is not necessarily a generous person because it may be the single action of the kind which he ever performed The motive and disposition of heart from which this action was performed may have been quite just and proper but as this happy mood seems to have been the effect rather of accidental humour than of any thing steady or permanent  in the character it can reflect no great honour upon the performer When we denominate a character generous or charitable or virtuous in any respect we mean to signify that the disposition expressed by each of those appellations is the usual and customary disposition of the person But single actions of any kind how proper and suitable soever are of little consequence to show that this is the case If a single action was sufficient to stamp the character of any virtue upon the person who performed it the most worthless of mankind might lay claim to all the virtues since there is no man who has not upon some occasions acted with prudence justice temperance and fortitude But tho' single actions how laudable soever reflect very little praise upon the person who performs them a single vitious action performed by one whose conduct is usually very regular greatly diminishes and sometimes destroys altogether our opinion of his virtue A single action of this kind sufficiently shows that his habits are not perfect and that he is less to be depended upon than from the usual train of his behaviour we might have been apt to imagine  Aristotle too  See Aristotle Mag Mor lib i ch  when he made virtue to consist in practical habits had it probably in his view to oppose the doctrine of Plato who seems to have been of opinion that just sentiments and reasonable judgments concerning what was fit to be done or to be avoided were alone sufficient to constitute the most perfect virtue Virtue according to Plato might be considered as a species of science and no man he thought could see clearly and demonstratively what was right and what was wrong and not act accordingly Passion might make us act contrary to doubtful and uncertain opinions not to plain and evident judgments Aristotle on the contrary was of opinion that no conviction of the understanding was capable of getting the better of inveterate habits and that good morals arose not from knowledge but from action  III According to Zeno  See Cicero de finibus lib iii also Diogenes Laertius in Zenone lib vii segment  the founder of the Stoical doctrine every animal was by nature recommended to its own care and was indowed with the principle of selflove  that it might endeavour to preserve not only its existence but all the different parts of its nature in the best and most perfect state of which they were capable  The selflove of man embraced if I may say so his body and all its different members his mind and all its different faculties and powers and desired the preservation and maintainance of them all in their best and most perfect condition Whatever tended to support this state of existence was therefore by nature pointed out to him as fit to be chosen and whatever tended to destroy it as fit to be rejected Thus health strength agility and ease of body as well as all the external conveniencies which could promote these wealth power honours the respect and esteem of those we live with were naturally pointed out to us as things eligible and of which the possession was preferable to the contrary On the other hand sickness infirmity unweildiness pain of body as well as all the external inconveniencies which tended to occasion or bring on any of them poverty the want of authority the contempt or hatred of those we live with were in the same manner pointed out to us as things to be shunned and avoided In each of those two  different classes of objects there were some which appeared to be more the objects either of choice or rejection than others in the same class Thus in the first class health appeared evidently preferable to strength and strength to agility reputation to power and power to riches And thus too in the second class sickness was more to be avoided than unweildeness of body ignominy than poverty and poverty than the want of authority Virtue and the propriety of conduct consisted in choosing and rejecting all different objects and circumstances according as they were by nature rendered more or less the objects of choice or rejection in selecting always from among the several objects of choice which were presented to us that which was most to be chosen when we could not obtain them all and in selecting too out of the several objects of rejection which might  e offered to us that which was least to be avoided when it was not in our power to avoid them all By choosing and rejecting with this just and accurate discernment by thus bestowing upon every object the precise degree of attention that was due to it according to the place which it held in this natural scale of things we maintained according to the  Stoics that perfect rectitude of conduct which constituted the essence of virtue This was what they called to live consistently to live according to nature and to obey those laws and directions which nature or the author of nature had prescribed for our conduct  So far the Stoical idea of propriety and virtue is not very different from that of Aristotle and the antient peripatetics What chiefly distinguished those two systems from one another was the different degrees of selfcommand which they required The peripatetics allowed of some degree of perturbation as suitable to the weakness of human nature and as useful to so imperfect a creature as man If his own misfortune excited no passionate grief if his own injuries called forth no violent resentment reason or a regard to the general rules which determined what was right and fit to done would commonly they thought be too weak to prompt him to avoid the one or to beat off the other The Stoics on the contrary demanded the most perfect apathy and regarded every emotion that could in the smallest degree disturb the tranquility of the mind as the effect of levity and folly The Peripatetics seem to have thought that no passion exceeded the bounds of propriety as long as  the spectator by the utmost effort of huma  ity could sympathize with it The stoics  n the contrary appear to have regarded every  assion as improper which made any demand  pon the sympathy of the spectator or re  uired him to alter in any respect the natural  nd ordinary state of his mind in order to  eep time with the vehemence of its emo  ons A man of virtue they seem to have  ought ought not to depend upon the ge  erosity of those he lives with for pardon or  pprobation  According to the stoics every event ought  a wise man to appear indifferent and what  its own sake could be the object neither  desire nor aversion neither of joy nor  rrow If he preferred some events to  if some situations were the objects of  choice and others of his rejection  Some of these expressions sound a little aukward in the  glish language they are literal translations of the technical  of the stoics  it  not because he regarded the one as in  emselves in any respect better than the other  thought that his own happiness would be  ore compleat in what is called the fortu  te than in what is commonly regarded as  distressful situation but because the  of action the rule which the gods had  given him for the direction of his condu  ▪ required him to choose and reject in this  Among the primary objects of natural inclination or among those things which nature had originally recommended to us  eligible was the prosperity of our family▪ of our relations of our friends of our coun  try of mankind and of the universe in ge  neral Nature too had taught us that as  prosperity of two was preferable to that  one that of many or of all must be  more so That we ourselves were but  ▪ and that consequently wherever our  was inconsistent with that either  the whole or of any considerable  of the whole it ought even in our  choice to yield to what was so vastly preferable As all the events in this world  conducted by the providence of a  powerful and good God we might be  that whatever happened tended to  prosperity and perfection of the whole  we ourselves therefore were in poverty  sickness or in any other calamity we  first of all to use our utmost endeavours  far as justice and our duty to others would  to rescue ourselves from this disagr  able circumstance But if after all we  do we found this impossible we ought to rest satisfied that the order and perfection of the universe required that we should in the mean time continue in this situation And as the prosperity of the whole should even to us appear preferable to so insignificant a part as ourselves our situation whatever it was ought from that moment to become the object of our choice and even of our desire if we would maintain that compleat propriety and rectitude of sentiment and conduct in which the perfection of our nature consists If indeed any opportunity of extricating ourselves should offer it became our duty to embrace it The order of the universe it was evident no longer required our continuance in this situation and the great director of the world plainly called upon us  o leave it by so clearly pointing out the road which we were to follow It was the same  ase with the adversity of our relations our  riends our country If without violating  ny more sacred obligation it was in our  ower to prevent or to put an end to their  alamity it undoubtedly was our duty to do  The propriety of action the rule which  upiter had given us for the direction of our  onduct evidently required this of us But  if it was altogether out of our power to do either we ought then to consider this event as the most fortunate which could possibly have happened Because we might be assured that it tended most to the prosperity and order of the whole which was what we ourselves if we were wise and equitable ought most of all to desire  In what sense says Epictetus are some things said to be according to our nature and others contrary to it It is in that sense in which we co  sider ourselves as separated and detached from all other things For thus it may be said to be according to the nature of the foot to be always clean But if you consider it as a foot and not as something detached from the rest of the body it must behoove it sometimes to trample in the di  t and sometimes to tread upon thorns and sometimes too to be cut off for the sake of the whole body and if it refuses this it is no longer a foot Thus too ought  to conceive with regard to ourselves What are you A man If you consider yourse  as something separated and detached it i  agreeable to your nature to live to old age▪ to be rich to be in health But if you consider yourself as a man and as a part  a whole upon account of that whole i  will behoove you sometimes to be in sickness sometimes to be exposed to the inconveniency of a sea voyage sometimes to be in want and at last perhaps to die before your time Why then do you complain Don't you know that by doing so as the foot ceases to be a foot so you cease to be a man  Arrian lib ii c    This submission to the order of the universe this entire indifference with regard to whatever concerns ourselves when put into the balance with the interest of the whole could derive its propriety it is evident from no other principle besides that upon which I have endeavoured to show that the propriety of justice was founded As long as we view our own interests with our own eyes it is scarce possible that we should willingly acquiesce in their being thus sacrificed to the  nterests of the whole It is only when we view those opposite interests with the eyes of others that what concerns ourselves can appear  o be so contemptible in the comparison as to  e resigned without any reluctance To  very body but the person principally con  erned nothing can appear more agreeable to  reason and propriety than that the part should give place to the whole But what is agreeable to the reason of all other men ought not to appear contrary to his He himself therefore ought to approve of this sacrifice and acknowledge its conformity to reason But all the affections of a wise man according to the stoics are perfectly agreeable to reason and propriety and of their own accord coincide with whatever these ruling principles prescribe A wise man therefore could never feel any reluctance to comply with this disposition of things  IV Besides these antient there are some modern systems according to which virtue consists in propriety or in the suitableness of the affection from which we act to the cause or object which excites it The system of Dr Clark which places virtue in acting according to the relations of things in regulating our conduct according to the fitness or incongruity which there may be in the application of certain actions to certain things or to certain relations That of Mr Woollaston which places it in acting according to the truth of things according to their proper nature and essence or in treating them as what they really are and not as what they are not that  of my lord Shaftesbury which places it in maintaining a proper balance of the affections and in allowing no passion to go beyond its proper sphere are all of them more or less inaccurate descriptions of the same fundamental idea  The description of virtue which is either given or at least meant and intended to be given in each of those systems for some of the modern authors are not very fortunate in their manner of expressing themselves is no doubt quite just so far as it goes There is no virtue without propriety and wherever there is propriety some degree of approbation is due But still this description is imperfect For tho' propriety is an essential ingredient in every virtuous action it is not always the sole ingredient Beneficent actions have in them another quality by which they appear not only to deserve approbation but recompence None of those systems account either easily or sufficiently for that superior degree of esteem which seems due to such actions or for that diversity of sentiment which they naturally excite Neither is the description of vice more compleat For in the same manner tho' impropriety is a necessary ingredient in every vitious action it is not always the sole  ingredient and there is often the highest degree of absurdity and impropriety in very harmless and insignificant actions Deliberate actions of a pernicious tendency to those we live with have besides their impropriety a peculiar quality of their own by which they appear to deserve not only disapprobation but punishment and to be the objects not of dislike merely but of resentment and revenge and none of those systems easily and sufficiently accounts for that superior degree of detestation which we feel for such actions  CHAP II Of those systems which make virtue consist in prudence  THE most antient of those systems which make virtue consist in prudence and of which any considerable remains have come down to us is that of Epicurus who is said however to have borrowed all the leading principles of his philosophy from some of  hose who had gone before him particularly from Aristippus tho' it is very probable notwithstanding this allegation of his enemies  hat at least his manner of applying those principles was altogether his own  According to Epicurus  See Cicero de finibus lib i Diogenes Laert l x  bodily pleasure and  ain were the sole ultimate objects of natu  al desire and aversion That they were always the natural objects of those passions he  hought required no proof Pleasure might  ndeed appear sometimes to be avoided  ot however because it was pleasure but  ecause by the enjoyment of it we should  ither forfeit some greater pleasure or expose  ourselves to some pain that was more to be avoided than this pleasure was to be desired Pain in the same manner might appear sometimes to be eligible not however because it was pain but because by enduring it we might either avoid a still greater pain or acquire some pleasure of much more importance That bodily pain and pleasure therefore were always the natural objects of desire and aversion was he thought abundantly evident Nor was it less so he imagined that they were the sole ultimate objects of those passions Whatever else was either desired or avoided was so according to him upon account of its tendency to produce one or other of those sensations The tendency to procure pleasure rendered power and riches desireable as the contrary tendency to produce pain made poverty and insignificancy the objects of aversion Honour and reputation were valued because the esteem and love of those we live with were of the greatest consequence both to procure pleasure and to defend us from pain Ignominy and bad fame on the contrary were to be avoided because the hatred contempt and resentment of those we live with destroyed  all security and necessarily exposed us to the greatest bodily evils  All the pleasures and pains of the mind were according to Epicurus ultimately derived from those of the body The mind was happy when it thought of the past pleasures of the body and hoped for others to come and it was miserable when it thought of the pains which the body had formerly endured and dreaded the same or greater thereafter  But the pleasures and pains of the mind tho' ultimately derived from those of the body were vastly greater than their originals The body felt only the sensation of the present instant whereas the mind felt also the past and the future the one by remembrance the other by anticipation and consequently both suffered and enjoyed much more When we are under the greatest bodily pain he observed we shall always find if we attend to it that it is not the suffering of the present instant which chiefly  orments us but either the agonizing remembrance of the past or the yet more hor  ible dread of the future The pain of each  nstant considered by itself and cut off from  ll that goes before and all that comes after  it is a trifle not worth the regarding Yet this is all which the body can ever be said to suffer For the same manner when we enjoy the greatest pleasure we shall always find that the bodily sensation the sensation of the present instant makes but a small part of our happiness that our enjoyment chiefly arises either from the chearful recollection of the past or the still more joyous anticipation of the future and that the mind always contributes by much the largest share of the entertainment  Since our happiness and misery therefore depended chiefly upon the mind if this part of our nature was well disposed if our thoughts and opinions were as they should be it was of little importance in what manner our body was affected Tho' under great bodily pain we might still enjoy a considerable share of happiness if our reason and judgment maintained their superiority We might entertain ourselves with the remembrance of past and with the hopes of future pleasure we might soften the rigour of our pains by recollecting what it was which even in this situation we were under any necessity of suffering That this was meerly the bodily sensation the pain of the present instant which  by itself could never be very great That whatever agony we suffered from the dread of its continuance was the effect of an opinion of the mind which might be corrected by juster sentiments by considering that if our pains were violent they would probably be of short duration and that if they were of long continuance they would probably be moderate and admit of many intervals of ease and that at any rate death was always at hand and within call to deliver us which as according to him it put an end to all sensation either of pain or pleasure could not be regarded as an evil When we are said he death is not and when death is we are not death therefore can be nothing to us  If the actual sensation of positive pain was in itself so little to be feared that of pleasure was still less to be desired Naturally the sensation of pleasure was much less pungent than that of pain If therefore this last could take so very little from the happiness of a welldisposed mind the other could add scarce any thing to it When the body was free from pain and the mind from fear and anxiety the superadded sensation of bodily pleasure could be of very little importance and though it might diversify could not properly  be said to increase the happiness of this situation  In ease of body therefore and in security or tranquility of mind consisted according to Epicurus the most perfect state of human nature the most compleat happiness which man was capable of enjoying To obtain this great end of natural desire was the sole object of all the virtues which according to him were not desireable upon their own account but upon account of their tendency to bring about this situation  Prudence for example tho' according to this philosophy the source and principle of all the virtues was not desireable upon its own account That careful and laborious and circumspect state of mind ever watchful and ever attentive to the most distant consequences of every action could not be a thing pleasant or agreeable for its own sake but upon account of its tendency to the greatest goods and to keep off the greatest evils  To abstain from pleasure too to curb and restrain our natural passions for enjoyment which was the office of temperance could never be desireable for its own sake The whole value of this virtue arose from its utility from its enabling us to postpone the present  enjoyment for the sake of a greater to come or to avoid a greater pain that might ensue from it Temperance in short was nothing but prudence with regard to pleasure  To support labour to endure pain to be exposed to danger or to death the situations which fortitude would often lead us into were surely still less the objects of natural desire They are chosen only to avoid greater evils We submit to labour in order to avoid the greater shame and pain of poverty and we expose ourselves to danger and to death in defence of our liberty and property the means and instruments of pleasure and happiness or in defence of our country in the safety of which our own is necessarily comprehended Fortitude enables us to do all this chearfully as the best which in our present situation can possibly be done and is in reality no more than prudence good judgment and presence of mind in properly appreciating pain labour and danger always chusing the less in order to avoid the greater  It is the same case with justice To abstain from what is anothers is not desireable upon its own account and it cannot surely be better for you that I should possess what  is my own than that you should possess it You ought however to abstain from whatever belongs to me because by doing otherwise you will provoke the resentment and indignation of mankind The security and tranquility of your mind will be entirely destroyed You will be filled with fear and consternation at the thought of that punishment which you will imagine that men are at all times ready to inflict upon you and from which no power no art no concealment will ever in your own fancy be sufficient to protect you That other species of justice which consists in doing proper good offices to different persons according to the various relations of neighbours kinsmen friends benefactors superiors or equals which they may stand in to us is recommended by the same reasons To act properly in all these different relations procures us the esteem and love of those we live with as to do otherwise excites their contempt and hatred By the one we naturally secure by the other we necessarily endanger our own ease and tranquility the great and ultimate objects of all our desires The whole virtue of justice therefore the most important of all the virtues  is no more than discreet and prudent conduct with regard to our neighbours  Such is the doctrine of Epicurus concerning the nature of virtue It may seem extraordinary that this philosopher who is described as a person of the most amiable manners should never have observed that whatever may be the tendency of those virtues or of the contrary vices with regard to our bodily ease and security the sentiments which they naturally excite in others are the objects of a much more passionate desire or aversion than all their other consequences That to be amiable to be respectable to be the proper object of esteem is by every welldisposed mind more valued than all the ease and security which love respect and esteem can procure us That on the contrary to be odious to be contemptible to be the proper object of indignation is more dreaded than all that we can suffer in our body from hatred contempt or indignation and that consequently our desire of the one character and our aversion to the other cannot arise from any regard  o the effects which either of them is likely  o produce upon the body  This system is no doubt altogether inconsistent with that which I have been endeavouring to establish It is not difficult however to discover from what phasis if I may say so from what particular view or aspect of nature this account of things derives its probability By the wise contrivance of the author of nature virtue is upon all ordinary occasions even with regard to this life real wisdom and the surest and readiest means of obtaining both safety and advantage Our success or disappointment in our undertakings must very much depend upon the good or bad opinion which is commonly entertained of us and upon the general disposition of those we live with either to assist or to oppose us But the best the surest the easiest and the readiest way of obtaining the advantageous and avoiding the unfavourable judgments of others is undoubtedly to render ourselves the proper objects of the former and not of the latter  Do you desire said Socrates the reputation of a good musician The only sure way of obtaining it is to become a good musician Would you desire in the same manner to be thought capable of serving your country either as a general o  as a statesman The best way in this ca  too is really to acquire the art and experience of war and government and to become really fit to be a general or a statesman And in the same manner if you would be reckoned sober temperate just and equitable the best way of acquiring this reputation is to become sober temperate just and equitable If you can really render yourself amiable respectable and the proper object of esteem there is no fear of your not soon acquiring the love the respect and esteem of those you live with  Since the practice of virtue therefore is in general so advantageous and that of vice so contrary to our interest the consideration of those opposite tendencies undoubtedly stamps an additional beauty and propriety upon the one and a new deformity and impropriety upon the other Temperance magnanimity justice and beneficence come thus to be approved of not only under their proper characters but under the additional character of the highest wisdom and most real prudence And in the same manner the contrary vices of intemperance pusilanimity injustice and either malevolence or sordid selfishness come to be disapproved of not only under their proper characters  but under the additional character of the most shortsighted folly and weakness Epicurus appears in every virtue to have attended to this species of propriety only It is that which is most apt to occur to those who are endeavouring to persuade others to regularity of conduct When men by their practice and perhaps too by their maxims manifestly show that the natural beauty of virtue is not likely to have much effect upon them how is it possible to move them but by representing the folly of their conduct and how much they themselves are in the end likely to suffer by it  By running up all the different virtues too to this one species of propriety Epicurus indulged a propensity which is natural to all men but which philosophers in particular are apt to cultivate with a peculiar fondness as the great means of displaying their ingenuity the propensity to account for all appearances from as few principles as possible▪ And he no doubt indulged this propensity still further when he referred all the primary objects of natural desire and aversion to the pleasures and pains of the body The great patron of the atomical philosophy who  so much pleasure in deducing all the pow  and qualities of bodies from the most obvious and familiar the figure motion and arrangement of the small parts of matter felt no doubt a similar satisfaction when he accounted in the same manner for all the sentiments and passions of the mind from those which are most obvious and familiar  The system of Epicurus agreed with those of Plato Aristotle and Zeno in making virtue consist in acting in the most suitable manner to obtain the  Prima naturae  primary objects of natural desire It differed from all of them in two other respects first in the account which it gave of those primary objects of natural desire and secondly in the account which it gave of the excellence of virtue or of the reason why that quality ought to be esteemed  The primary objects of natural desire consisted according to Epicurus in bodily pleasure and pain and in nothing else whereas according to the other three philosophers there were many other objects such us knowledge such as the happiness of our relations of our friends of our country which were ultimately desireable for their own sake  Virtue too according to Epicurus did not deserve to be pursued for its own sake nor was itself one of the primary objects of natural appetite but was eligible only upon account of its tendency to prevent pain and to procure ease and pleasure In the opinion of the other three on the contrary it was desireable not meerly as the means of procuring the other primary objects of natural desire but as something which was in itself more valuable than them all Man they thought being born for action his happiness must consist not meerly in the agreeableness of his passive sensations but also in the propriety of his active exertions  CHAP III Of those systems which make virtue consist in benevolence  THE system which makes virtue consist in benevolence tho' I think not so antient as all of those which I have already given an account of is however of very great antiquity It seems to have been the doctrine of the greater part of those philosophers who about and after the age of Augustus called themselves Eclectics who pretended to follow chiefly the opinions of Plato and Pythagoras and who upon that account are commonly known by the name of the latter Platonists  In the divine nature according to these authors benevolence or love was the sole principle of action and directed the exertion of all the other attributes The wisdom of the deity was employed in finding out the means for bringing about those ends which his goodness suggested as his infinite power was exerted to execute them Benevolence  however was still the supreme and governing attribute to which the others were subservient and from which the whole excellency or the whole morality if I may be allowed such an expression of the divine operations was ultimately derived The whole perfection and virtue of the human mind consisted in some resemblance or participation of the divine perfections and consequently in being filled with the same principle of benevolence and love which influenced all the actions of the deity The actions of men which flowed from this motive were alone truly praiseworthy or could claim any merit in the sight of the deity It was by actions of charity and love only that we could imitate as became us the conduct of God that we could express our humble and devout admiration of his infinite perfections that by fostering in our own minds the same divine principle we could bring our own affections to a greater resemblance with his holy attributes and thereby become more proper objects of his love and esteem till at last we arrived at that immediate converse and communication with the deity to which it was  the great object of this philosophy to raise us  This system as it was much esteemed by many antient fathers of the christian church so after the reformation it was adopted by several divines of the most eminent piety and learning and of the most amiable manners particularly by Dr Ralph Cudworth by Dr Henry More and by Mr John Smith of Cambridge But of all the patrons of this system antient or modern the late Dr Hutcheson was undoubtedly beyond all comparison the most acute the most distinct the most philosophical and what is of the greatest consequence of all the soberest and most judicious  That virtue consists in benevolence is a notion supported by many appearances in human nature It has been observed already that proper benevolence is the most graceful and agreeable of all the affections That it is recommended to us by a double sympathy that as its tendency is necessarily beneficient it is the proper object of gratitude and reward and that upon all these accounts it appears to our natural sentiments to possess a merit superior to any other It has been observed  too that even the weaknesses of benevolence are not very disagreeable to us whereas those of every other passion are always extremely disgusting Who does not abhor excessive malice excessive selfishness or excessive resentment But the most excessive indulgence even of partial friendship is not so offensive It is the benevolent passions only which can exert themselves without any regard or attention to propriety and yet retain something about them which is engaging There is something pleasing even in mere instinctive goodwill which goes on to do good offices without once reflecting whether by this conduct it is the proper object either of blame or approbation It is not so with the other passions The moment they are deserted the moment they are unaccompanied by the sense of propriety they cease to be agreeable  As benevolence bestows upon those actions which proceed from it a beauty superior to all others so the want of it and much more the contrary inclination communicates a peculiar deformity to whatever evidences such a disposition Pernicious actions are often punishable for no other reason than because  they show a want of sufficient attention to the happiness of our neighbour  Besides all this Dr Hutcheson  See enquiry concerning virtue sect and  observed that whenever in any action supposed to proceed from benevolent affections some other motive had been discovered our sense of the merit of this action was just so far diminished as this motive was believed to have influenced it If an action supposed to proceed from gratitude should be discovered to have arisen from an expectation of some new favour or if what was apprehended to proceed from public spirit should be found out to have taken its origin from the hope of a pecuniary reward such a discovery would entirely destroy all notion of merit or praiseworthiness in either of these actions Since therefore the mixture of any selfish motive like that of a baser alloy diminished or took away altogether the merit which would otherwise have belonged to any action it was evident he imagined that virtue must consist in pure and disinterested benevolence alone  When those actions on the contrary which are commonly supposed to proceed  from a selfish motive are discovered to have arisen from a benevolent one it greatly enhances our sense of their merit If we believed of any person that he endeavoured to advance his fortune from no other view but that of doing friendly offices and of making proper returns to his benefactors we should only love and esteem him the more And this observation seemed still more to confirm the conclusion that it was benevolence only which could stamp upon any action the character of virtue  Last of all what he imagined was an evident proof of the justness of this account of virtue in all the disputes of casuists concerning the rectitude of conduct the public good he observed was the standard to which they constantly referred thereby universally acknowledging that whatever tended to promote the happiness of mankind was right and laudable and virtuous and the contrary wrong blameable and vitious In the late debates about passive obedience and the right of resistence the sole point in controversy among men of sense was whether universal submission would probably be attended with greater evils than temporary insurrections  when privileges were invaded Whether what upon the whole tended most to the happiness of mankind was not also morally good was never once he said made a question  Since benevolence therefore was the only motive which could bestow upon any action the character of virtue the greater the benevolence which was evidenced by any action the greater the praise which must belong to it  Those actions which aimed at the happiness of a great community as they demonstrated a more enlarged benevolence than those which aimed only at that of a smaller system so were they likewise proportionally the more virtuous The most virtuous of all affections therefore was that which embraced as its object the happiness of all intelligent beings The least virtuous on the contrary of those to which the character of virtue could in any respect belong was that which aimed no further than at the happiness of an individual such as a son a brother a friend  In directing all our actions to promote the greatest possible good in submitting all inferior  affections to the desire of the general happiness of mankind in regarding ourselves but as one of the many whose prosperity was to be pursued no further than it was consistent with or conducive to that of the whole consisted the perfection of virtue  Selflove was a principle which could never be virtuous in any degree or in any direction It was vitious whenever it obstructed the general good When it had no other effect than to make the individual take care of his own happiness it was meerly innocent and tho' it deserved no praise neither ought it to incur any blame Those benevolent actions which were performed notwithstanding some strong motive from selfinterest were the more virtuous upon that account They demonstrated the strength and vigour of the benevolent principle  Dr Hutcheson  Inquiry concerning virtue sect art also illustrations on the moral sense sect last paragraph  was so far from allowing selflove to be in any case a motive of virtuous actions that even a regard to the pleasure of selfapprobation to the comfortable applause of our own consciences according  to him diminished the merit of a benevolent action This was a selfish motive he thought which so far as it contributed to any action demonstrated the weakness of that pure and disinterested benevolence which could alone stamp upon the conduct of men the character of virtue In the common judgments of mankind however this regard to the approbation of our own minds is so far from being considered as what can in any respect diminish the virtue of any action that it is rather looked upon as the sole motive which deserves the appellation of virtuous  Such is the account given of the nature of virtue in this amiable system a system which has a peculiar tendency to nourish and support in the human heart the noblest and the most agreeable of all affections and not only to check the injustice of selflove but in some measure to discourage that principle altogether by representing it as what could never reflect any honour upon those who were influenced by it  As some of the other systems which I have already given an account of do not sufficiently explain from whence arises the peculiar excellency of the supreme virtue of beneficence  so this system seems to have the contrary defect of not sufficiently explaining from whence arises our approbation of the inferior virtues of prudence vigilance circumspection temperance constancy firmness The view and aim of our affections the beneficent and hurtful effects which they tend to produce are the only qualities that are at all attended to in this system Their propriety and impropriety their suitableness and unsuitableness to the cause which excites them are disregarded altogether  Regard to our own private happiness and interest too appear upon many occasions very laudable principles of action The habits of oeconomy industry discretion attention and application of thought are generally supposed to be cultivated from selfinterested motives and at the same time are apprehended to be very praiseworthy qualities which deserve the esteem and approbation of every body The mixture of a selfish motive it is true seems often to sully the beauty of those actions which ought to arise from a benevolent affection The cause of this however is not that selflove can never be the  motive of a virtuous action but that the benevolent principle appears in this particular case to want its due degree of strength and to be altogether unsuitable to its object The character therefore seems evidently imperfect and upon the whole to deserve blame rather than praise The mixture of a benevolent motive in an action to which selflove alone ought to be sufficient to prompt us is not so apt indeed to diminish our sense of its propriety or of the virtue of the person who performs it We are not ready to suspect any person of being defective in selfishness This is by no means the weak side of human nature or the failing of which we are apt to be suspicious If we could really believe however of any man that was it not from a regard to his family and friends he would not take that proper care of his health his life or his fortune to which selfpreservation ought alone to be sufficient to prompt him it would undoubtedly be a failing tho' one of those amiable failings which render a person rather the object of pity than of contempt or hatred It would still however somewhat diminish the dignity and respectableness of his character Carelessness and want of oeconomy are universally disapproved of▪  not however as proceeding from a want of benevolence but from a want of the proper attention to the objects of selfinterest  Tho' the standard by which casuists frequently determine what is right or wrong in human conduct be its tendency to the welfare or disorder of society it does not follow that a regard to the welfare of society should be the sole virtuous motive of action but only that in any competition it ought to cast the balance against all other motives  Benevolence may perhaps be the sole principle of action in the deity and there are several not improbable arguments which tend to persuade us that it is so It is not easy to conceive what other motive an independent and allperfect being who stands in need of nothing external and whose happiness is compleat in himself can act from But whatever may be the case with the deity so imperfect a creature as man the support of whose existence requires so many things external to him must often act from many other motives The condition of human nature were peculiarly hard if those affections which by the very nature of our being ought frequently to influence our conduct could upon no occasion appear virtuous or  deserve esteem and commendation from any body  Those three systems that which places virtue in propriety that which places it in prudence and that which makes it consist in benevolence are the principal accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue To one or other of them all the other descriptions of virtue how different soever they may appear are easily reducible  That system which places virtue in obedience to the will of the deity may be counted either among those which make it consist in prudence or among those which make it consist in propriety When it is asked why we ought to obey the will of the deity this question which would be impious and absurd in the highest degree if asked from any doubt that we ought to obey him can admit but of two different answers It must either be said that we ought to obey the will of the deity because he is a being of infinite power who will reward us eternally if we do so and punish us eternally if we do otherwise Or it must be said that independent of any regard to our own happiness or to rewards and punishments  of any kind there is a congruity and fitness that a creature should obey its creator that a limited and imperfect being should submit to one of infinite and incomprehensible perfections Besides one or other of these two it is impossible to conceive that any other answer can be given to this question If the first answer be the proper one virtue consists in prudence or in the proper pursuit of our own final interest and happiness since it is upon this account that we are obliged to obey the will of the deity If the second answer be the proper one virtue must consist in propriety since the ground of our obligation to obedience is the suitableness or congruity of the sentiments of humility and submission to the superiority of the object which excites them  That system which places virtue in utility coincides too with that which makes it consist in propriety According to this system all those qualities of the mind which are agreeable or advantageous either to the person himself or to others are approved of as virtuous and the contrary disapproved of as vitious But the agreeableness or utility  of any affection depends upon the degree which it is allowed to subsist in Every affection is useful when it is confined to a certain degree of violence and every affection is disadvantageous when it exceeds the bounds of this moderation According to this system therefore virtue consists not in any one affection but in the proper degree of all the affections The only difference between it and that which I have been endeavouring to establish is that it makes utility and not sympathy or the correspondent affection of the spectator the measure of this proper degree  CHAP IV Of licentious systems  ALL those systems which I have hitherto given an account of suppose that there is a real and essential distinction between vice and virtue whatever these qualities may consist in There is a real and essential difference between the propriety and impropriety of any affection between benevolence and any other principle of action between real prudence and short sighted folly or precipitate rashness In the main too all of them contribute to encourage the praiseworthy and to discourage the blameable disposition  It may be true perhaps of some of them that they tend in some measure to break the ballance of the affections and to give the mind a particular biass to some principles of action beyond the proportion that is due to them The antient systems which place virtue in propriety seem chiefly to recommend the great the awful and the respectable  virtues the virtues of selfgovernment and selfcommand fortitude magnanimity independency upon fortune the contempt of all outward accidents of pain poverty exile and death It is in these great exertions that the noblest propriety of conduct is displayed The soft the amiable the gentle virtues all the virtues of indulgent humanity are in comparison but little insisted upon and seem on the contrary by the Stoics in particular to have been often regarded as meer weaknesses which it behoved a wise man not to harbour in his breast  The benevolent system on the other hand while it fosters and encourages all those milder virtues in the highest degree seems entirely to neglect the more awful and respectable qualities of the mind It even denies them the appellation of virtues It calls them moral abilities and treats them as qualities which do not deserve the same sort of esteem and approbation which is due to what is properly denominated virtue All those principles of action which aim only at our own interest it treats if that be possible still worse So far from having any merit of their own they diminish it pretends the merit of benevolence when they cooperate  with it and prudence it is asserted when employed only in promoting private interest can never even be imagined a virtue  That system again which makes virtue consist in prudence only while it gives the highest encouragement to the habits of caution vigilance sobriety and judicious moderation seems to degrade equally both the amiable and respectable virtues and to strip the former of all their beauty and the latter of all their grandeur  But notwithstanding these defects the general tendency of each of those three systems is to encourage the best and most laudable habits of the human mind and it were well for society if either mankind in general or even those few who pretend to live according to any philosophical rule were to regulate their conduct by the precepts of any one of them We may learn from each of them something that is both valuable and peculiar If it was possible by precept and exhortation to inspire the mind with fortitude and magnanimity the antient systems of propriety would seem sufficient to do this Or if it was possible by the same means to soften  it into humanity and to awaken the affections of kindness and general love towards those we live with some of the pictures with which the benevolent system presents us might seem capable of producing this effect We may learn from the system of Epicurus tho' undoubtedly the worst of all the three how much the practice of both the amiable and respectable virtues is conducive to our own interest to our own ease and safety and quiet even in this life As Epicurus placed happiness in the attainment of ease and security he exerted himself in a particular manner to show that virtue was not meerly the best and the surest but the only means of acquiring those invaluable possessions The good effects of virtue upon our inward tranquility and peace of mind are what other philosophers have chiefly celebrated Epicurus without neglecting this topic has chiefly insisted upon the influence of that amiable quality on our outward prosperity and safety It was upon this account that his writings were so much studied in the antient world by men of all different philosophical parties It is from him that Cicero the great enemy of the Epicurean system borrows his most agreeable proofs that virtue  alone is sufficient to secure happiness Seneca tho' a stoic the sect most opposite to that of Epicurus yet quotes this philosopher more frequently than any other  There are however some other systems which seem to take away altogether the distinction between vice and virtue and of which the tendency is upon that account wholly pernicious I mean the systems of the duke of Rochefaucault and Dr Mandeville Tho' the notions of both these authors are in almost every respect erroneous there are however some appearances in human nature which when viewed in a certain manner seem at first sight to favour them These first slightly sketched out with the elegance and delicate precision of the duke of Rochefaucault and afterwards more fully represented with the lively and humourous tho' coarse and rustic eloquence of Dr Mandeville have thrown upon their doctrines an air of truth and probability which is very apt to impose upon the unskilful  Dr Mandeville the most methodical of those two authors considers whatever is done from a sense of propriety from a regard to what is commendable and praiseworthy as  being done from a love of praise and commendation or as he calls it from vanity Man he observes is naturally much more interested in his own happiness than in that of others and it is impossible that in his heart he can ever really prefer their prosperity to his own Whenever he appears to do so we may be assured that he imposes upon us and that he is then acting from the same selfish motives as at all other times Among his other selfish passions vanity is one of the strongest and he is always easily flattered and greatly delighted with the applauses of those about him When he appears to sacrifice his own interest to that of his companions he knows that this conduct will be highly agreeable to their selflove and that they will not fail to express their satisfaction by bestowing upon him the most extravagant praises The pleasure which he expects from this overbalances in his opinion the interest which he abandons in order to procure it His conduct therefore upon this occasion is in reality just as selfish and arises from just as mean a motive as upon any other He is flattered however and he flatters himself with the belief that it is entirely disinterested since unless this was supposed it  would not seem to merit any commendation either in his own eyes or in those of others All public spirit therefore all preference of public to private interest is according to him a meer cheat and imposition upon mankind and that human virtue which is so much boasted of and which is the occasion of so much emulation among men is the meer offspring of flattery begot upon pride  Whether the most generous and public spirited actions may not in some sense be regarded as proceeding from selflove I shall not at present examine The decision of this question is not I apprehend of any importance towards establishing the reality of virtue since selflove may frequently be a virtuous motive of action I shall only endeavour to show that the desire of doing what is honourable and noble of rendering ourselves the proper objects of esteem and approbation cannot with any propriety be called vanity Even the love of wellgrounded fame and reputation the desire of acquiring esteem by what is really estimable does not deserve that name The first is the love of virtue the noblest and best passion of human nature The second is the love of true glory a passion inferior no doubt to the former  but which in dignity appears to come immediately after it He is guilty of vanity who desires praise for qualities which are either not praiseworthy in any degree or not in that degree in which he expects to be praised for them who sets his character upon the frivolous ornaments of dress and equipage or the equally frivolous accomplishments of ordinary behaviour He is guilty of vanity who desires praise for what indeed very well deserves it but what he perfectly knows does not belong to him The empty coxcomb who gives himself airs of importance which he has no title to the silly liar who assumes the merit of adventures which never happened the foolish plagiary who gives himself out for the author of what he has no pretensions to are properly accused of this passion He too is said to be guilty of vanity who is not contented with the silent sentiments of esteem and approbation who seems to be fonder of their noisy expressions and acclamations than of the sentiments themselves who is never satisfied but when his own praises are ringing in his ears and who sollicits with the most anxious importunity all external marks of respect is fond of titles of compliments of being visited of being  attended of being taken notice of in public places with the appearance of deference and attention This frivolous passion is altogether different from either of the two former and is the passion of the lowest and the least of mankind as they are of the noblest and the greatest  But tho' these three passions the desire of rendering ourselves the proper objects of honour and esteem or of becoming what is honourable and estimable the desire of acquiring honour and esteem by really deserving those sentiments and the frivolous desire of praise at any rate are widely different tho' the two former are always approved of while the latter never fails to be despised there is however a certain remote affinity among them which exaggerated by the humorous and diverting eloquence of this lively author has enabled him to impose upon his readers There is an affinity between vanity and the love of true glory as both these passions aim at acquiring esteem and approbation But they are different in this that the one is a just reasonable and equitable passion while the other is unjust absurd and ridiculous The man who desires esteem for what is really estimable desires  nothing but what he is justly entitled to and what cannot be refused him without some sort of injury He on the contrary who desires it upon any other terms demands what he has no just claim to The first is easily satisfied is not apt to be jealous or suspicious that we do not esteem him enough and is seldom sollicitous about receiving many external marks of our regard The other on the contrary is never to be satisfied is full of jealousy and suspicion that we do not esteem him so much as he desires because he has some secret consciousness that he desires more than he deserves The least neglect of ceremony he considers as a mortal affront and as an expression of the most determined contempt He is restless and impatient and perpetually afraid that we have  ost all respect for him and is upon this account always anxious to obtain new expressions of esteem and cannot be kept in temper but by continual attendance and adu  ation  There is an affinity too between the desire of becoming what is honourable and estim  ble and the desire of honour and esteem  etween the love of virtue and the love of  rue glory They resemble one another not  only in this respect that both aim at really being what is honourable and noble but even in that respect in which the love of true glory resembles what is properly called vanity some reference to the sentiments of others The man of the greatest magnanimity who desires virtue for its own sake and is most indifferent about what actually are the opinions of mankind with regard to him is still however delighted with the thoughts of what they should be with the consciousness that tho' he may neither be honoured nor applauded he is still the proper object of honour and applause and that if mankind were cool and candid and consistent with themselves and properly informed of the motives and circumstances of his conduct they would not fail to honour and applaud him Tho' he despises the opinions which are actually entertained of him yet he has the highest value for those which ought to be entertained of him That he might think himself worthy of those honourable sentiments and whatever was the idea which other men might conceive of his character that when he should put himself in their situation and consider not what was but what ought to be their opinion he should always have the  highest idea of it himself was the great and  xalted motive of his conduct As even in  he love of virtue therefore there is still some  eference tho' not to what is yet to what in  eason and propriety ought to be the opinion of others there is even in this respect some  ffinity between it and the love of true glory There is however at the same time a very great difference between them The man who acts solely from a regard to what is right  nd fit to be done from a regard to what is  he proper object of esteem and approbation  ho' these sentiments should never be bestowed  pon him acts from the most sublime and godlike motive which human nature is even  apable of conceiving The man on the other  and who while he desires to merit appro  ation is at the same time anxious to obtain  t tho' he too is laudable in the main yet  is motives have a greater mixture of human  nfirmity He is in danger of being morti  ied by the ignorance and injustice of man  ind and his happiness is exposed to the envy  f his rivals and the folly of the publick The happiness of the other on the contrary is  ltogether secure and independent of fortune  nd of the caprice of those he lives with  The contempt and hatred which may be thrown upon him by the ignorance of mankind he considers as not belonging to him and is not at all mortified by it Mankind despise and hate him from a false notion of his character and conduct If they knew him better they would esteem and love him It is not him whom properly speaking they hate and despise but another person whom they mistake him to be Our friend whom we should meet at a masquerade in the garb of our enemy would be more diverted than mortified if under that disguise we should vent our indignation against him Such are the sentiments of a man of real magnanimity when exposed to unjust censure It seldom happens however that human nature arrives at this degree of firmness Tho' none b  t the weakest and most worthless of mankind are much delighted with false glory yet by a strange inconsistency false ignominy is often capable of mortifying those who appear the most resolute and determined  Dr Mandeville is not satisfied with representing the frivolous motive of vanity as the source of all those actions which are commonly accounted virtuous He endeavours to point out the imperfection of human virtue  in many other respects In every case he pretends it falls short of that compleat selfdenial which it pretends to and instead of a conquest is commonly no more than a concealed indulgence of our passions Wherever our reserve with regard to pleasure▪ falls short of the most ascetic abstinence he treats it as gross luxury and sensuality Every thing according to him is luxury which exceeds what is absolutely necessary for the support of human nature so that there is vice even in the use of a clean shirt or of a convenient habitation The indulgence of the inclination to sex in the most lawful union he considers as the same sensuality with the most hurtful gratification of that passion and derides that temperance and that chastity which can be practised at so cheap a rate The ingenious sophistry of his reasoning is here as upon many other occasions covered by the ambiguity of language There are some of our passions which have no other names except those which mark the disagreeable and offensive degree The spectator is more apt to take notice of them in this degree than in any other When they shock his own sentiments when they give him some sort of antipathy and uneasiness he is necessarily obliged to attend  to them and is from thence naturally led to give them a name When they fall in with the natural state of his own mind he is very apt to overlook them altogether and either gives them no name at all or if he gives them any it is one which marks rather the subjection and restraint of the passion than the degree which it still is allowed to subsist in after it is so subjected and restrained Thus the common names of the  Luxury and lust  love of pleasure and of the  b  love of sex denote a vitious and offensive degree of those passions The words temperance and chastity on the other hand seem to mark rather the restraint and subjection which they are kept under than the degree which they are still allowed to subsist in▪ When he can show therefore that they still subsist in some degree he imagines he has entirely demolished the reality of the virtue  of temperance and chastity and shown them to be meer impositions upon the inattenti  and simplicity of mankind Those virtues however do not require an entire insensibility to the objects of the passions which they mean to govern They only aim at restraining the violence of those passions so far as not  to hurt the individual and neither disturb nor offend the society  It is the great fallacy of Dr Mandeville's book  Fable of the Bees  to represent every passion as wholly vitious which is so in any degree and in any direction It is thus that he treats every thing as vanity which has any reference either to what are or to what ought to be the sentiments of others and it is by means of this sophistry that he establishes his favourite conclusion that private vices are public benefits If the love of magnificence a taste for the elegant arts and improvements of human life for whatever is agreeable in dress furniture or equipage for architecture statuary paint  ng and music is to be regarded as luxury sensuality and ostentation even in those whose situation allows without any inconveniency the indulgence of those passions it is certain that luxury sensuality and ostentation are public benefits since without the qualities upon which he thinks proper to bestow such opprobrious names the arts of refinement could never find encouragement and must  anguish for want of employment Some popular ascetic doctrines which had been current  before his time and which placed virtue in the entire extirpation and annihilation of all our passions were the real foundation of this licentious system It was easy for Dr Mandeville to prove first that this entire conquest never actually took place among men and secondly that if it was to take place universally it would be pernicious to society by putting an end to all industry and commerce and in a manner to the whole business of human life By the first of these propositions he seemed to prove that there was no real virtue and that what pretended to be such was a meer cheat and imposition upon mankind and by the second that private vices were public benefits since without them no society could prosper or flourish  Such is the system of Dr Mandeville which once made so much noise in the world and which tho' perhaps it never gave occasion to more vice than what would have been without it at least taught that vice which arose from other causes to appear with more effrontery and to avow the corruption of its motives with a profligate audaciousness which had never been heared of before  But how destructive soever this system may appear it could never have imposed upon so great a number of persons nor have occasioned so general an alarm among those who are the friends of better principles had it not in some respects bordered upon the truth A system of natural philosophy may appear very plausible and be for a long time very generally received in the world and yet have no foundation in nature nor any sort of resemblance to the truth The vortices of Des Cartes were regarded by a very ingenious nation for near a century together as a most satisfactory account of the revolutions of the heavenly bodies Yet it has been demonstrated to the conviction of all mankind that these pretended causes of those wonderful effects not only do not actually exist but are utterly impossible and if they did exist could produce no such effects as are ascribed to them But it is otherwise with systems of moral philosophy and an author who pretends to account for the origin of our moral sentiments cannot deceive us so grossly nor depart so very far from all resemblance to the truth When a traveller gives us an account of some distant country he may impose upon our credulity the most groundless and absurd  as the most certain matters of fact But when a person pretends to inform us of what passes in our own neighbourhood and of the affairs of the very parish which we live in tho' here too if we are so careless as not to examine things with our own eyes he may deceive us in many respects yet the greatest falshoods which he imposes upon us must bear some resemblance to the truth and must even have a considerable mixture of truth in them An author who treats of natural philosophy and pretends to assign the causes of the great phaenomena of the universe pretends to give an account of the affairs of a very distant country concerning which he may tell us what he pleases and as long as his narration keeps within the bounds of seeming possibility he need not despair of gaining our belief But when he proposes to explain the origin of our desires and affections of our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation he pretends to give an account not only of the affairs of the very parish that we live in but of our own domestic concerns Tho' here too like indolent masters who put their trust in a steward who deceives them we are very liable to be imposed upon yet we are incapable of passing  any account which does not preserve some little regard to the truth Some of the articles at least must be just and even those which are most overcharged must have had some foundation otherwise the fraud would  e detected even by that careless inspection which we are disposed to give The author who should assign as the cause of any natu  al sentiment some principle which neither  ad any connection with it nor resembled  ny other principle which had some such  onnection would appear absurd and ridicu  ous to the most injudicious and unexperi  nced reader  SECTION III Of the different systems which have been formed concerning the principle of approbation  INTRODUCTION  AFTER the inquiry concerning the nature of virtue the next question of importance in Moral Philosophy is concerning the principle of approbation concerning the power or faculty of the mind which renders certain characters agreeable or disagreeable to us makes us prefer one tenor of conduct to another denominate the one right and the other wrong and consider the one as the object of approbation honour and reward the other as that of blame censure and punishment  Three different accounts have been give  of this principle of approbation According to some we approve and disapprove  of our own actions and of those of others from selflove only or from some view  their tendency to our own happiness or d  advantage according to others▪ reason  same faculty by which we distinguish between truth and falshood enables us to distinguish between what is fit and unfit both in actions and affections according to others this distinction is altogether the effect of immediate sentiment and feeling and arises from the satisfaction or disgust with which the view of certain actions or affections inspires us Selflove reason and sentiment therefore are the three different sources which have been assigned for the principle of approbation  Before I proceed to give an account of those different systems I must observe that the determination of this second question though of the greatest importance in speculation is of none in practice The question concerning the nature of virtue necessarily has some influence upon our notions of right and wrong in many particular cases That concerning the principle of approbation can possibly have no such effect To examine from what contrivance or mechanism within those different notions or sentiments arise is a meer matter of philosophical curiosity  CHAP I Of those systems which deduce the principle of approbation from selflove  THOSE who account for the principle of approbation from selflove do not all account for it in the same manner and there is a good deal of confusion and inaccuracy in all their different systems According to Mr Hobbs and many of his followers  Puffendorf Mandeville  man is driven to taken refuge in society not by any natural love which he bears to his own kind but because without the assistance of others he is incapable of subsisting with ease or safety Society upon this account becomes necessary to him and whatever tends to its support and welfare he considers as having a remote tendency to his own interest and on the contrary whatever is likely to disturb or destroy it he regards as in some measure hurtful or pernicious to himself Virtue is the great support and vice the great disturber of human society The former therefore is agreeable and the  latter offensive to every man as from the one he foresees the prosperity and from the other the ruin and disorder of what is so necessary for the comfort and security of his existence  That the tendency of virtue to promote and of vice to disturb the order of society when we consider it coolly and philosophically reflects a very great beauty upon the one and a very great deformity upon the other cannot as I have observed upon a former occasion be called in question Human society when we contemplate it in a certain abstract and philosophical light appears like a great an immense machine whose regular and harmonious movements produce a thousand agreeable effects As in any other beautiful and noble machine that was the production of human art whatever tended to render its movements more smooth and easy would derive a beauty from this effect and on the contrary whatever tended to obstruct them would displease upon that account so virtue which is as it were  he fine polish to the wheels of society necessarily pleases while vice like the vile  ust which makes them jarr and grate upon one another is as necessarily offensive This  account therefore of the origin of approbation and disapprobation so far as it derives them from a regard to the order of society runs into that principle which gives beauty to utility and which I have explained upon a former occasion and it is from thence that this system derives all that appearance of probability which it possesses When those authors describe the innumerable advantages of a cultivated and social above a savage and solitary life when they expatiate upon the necessity of virtue and good order for the maintainance of the one and demonstrate how infallibly the prevalence of vice and disobedience to the laws tend to bring back the other the reader is charmed with the novelty and grandeur of those views which they open to him he sees plainly a new beauty in virtue and a new deformity in vice which he had never taken notice of before and is commonly so delighted with the discovery that he seldom takes time to reflect that this political view having never occurred to him in his life before cannot possibly be the ground of that approbation and disapprobation with which he has always been accustomed to consider those different qualities  When those authors on the other hand deduce from selflove the interest which we take in the welfare of society and the esteem which upon that account we bestow upon virtue they do not mean that when we in this age applaud the virtue of Cato and detest the villainy of Catiline our sentiments are influenced by the notion of any benefit we receive from the one or of any detriment we suffer from the other It was not because the prosperity or subversion of society in those remote ages and nations was apprehended to have any influence upon our happiness or misery in the present times that according to those philosophers we esteemed the virtuous and blamed the disorderly character They never imagined that our sentiments were influenced by any benefit or damage which we supposed actually to redound to us from either but by that which might have redounded to us had we lived in those distant ages and countries or by that which might still redound to us if in our own times we should meet with characters of the same kind The idea in short which those authors were groping about but which they were never able to unfold distinctly was that indirect sympathy which we feel with  the gratitude or resentment of those who received the benefit or suffered the damage resulting from such opposite characters and it was this which they were indistinctly pointing at when they said that it was not the thought of what we had gained or suffered which prompted our applause or indignation but the conception or imagination of what we might gain or suffer if we were to act in society with such associates  Sympathy however cannot in any sense be regarded as a selfish principle When I sympathize with your sorrow or your indignation it may be pretended indeed that my emotion is founded in selflove because it arises from bringing your case home to myself from putting myself in your situation and thence conceiving what I should feel in the like circumstances But tho' sympathy is very properly said to arise from an imaginary change of situations with the person principally concerned yet this imaginary change is not supposed to happen to me in my own person and character but in that of the person with whom I sympathize When I condole with you for the loss of your only son in order to enter into your grief I do not consider what I a person of such a character  and profession should suffer if I had a son and if that son was unfortunately to die but I consider what I should suffer if I was really you and I not only change circumstances with you but I change persons and characters My grief therefore is entirely upon your account and not in the least upon my own It is not therefore in the least selfish How can that be regarded as a selfish passion which does not arise even from the imagination of any thing that has befallen or that relates to myself in my own proper person and character but which is entirely occupied about what relates to you A man may sympathize with a woman in childbed though it is impossible that he should conceive himself as suffering her pains in his own proper person and character That whole account of human nature however which deduces all sentiments and affections from selflove which has made so much noise in the world but which so far as I know has never yet been fully and distinctly explained  eems to me to have arisen from some con  used misapprehension of the system of sym  athy  CHAP II Of those systems which make reason the principle of approbation  IT is well known to have been the doctrine of Mr Hobbs that a state of nature is a state of war and that antecedent to the institution of civil government there could be no safe or peaceable society among men To preserve society therefore according to him was to support civil government and to distroy civil government was the same thing as to put an end to society But the existence of civil government depends upon the obedience that is paid to the supreme magistrate The moment he loses his authority all government is at an end As selfpreservation therefore teaches men to applaud whatever tends to promote the welfare of society and to blame whatever is likely to hurt it so the same principle if they would think and speak consistently ought to teach them to applaud upon all occasions obedience to the civil magistrate and to blame all disobedience and rebellion  The very ideas of laudable and blameable ought to be the same with those of obedience and disobedience The laws of the civil magistrate therefore ought to be regarded as the sole ultimate standards of what was just and unjust of what was right and wrong  It was the avowed intention of Mr Hobbs by propagating these notions to subject the consciences of men immediately to the civil  nd not to the ecclesiastical powers whose  urbulence and ambition he had been taught by the example of his own times to regard  s the principal source of the disorders of  ociety His doctrine upon this account was peculiarly offensive to Theologians who  ccordingly did not fail to vent their indigna  ion against him with great asperity and  itterness It was likewise offensive to all  ound moralists as it supposed that there was  o natural distinction between right and wrong that these were mutable and change  ble and depended upon the meer arbitrary will of the civil magistrate This account  f things therefore was attacked from all  uarters and by all sorts of weapons by sober  eason as well as by furious declamation  In order to confute so odious a doctrine it was necessary to prove that antecedent to all law or positive institution the mind was naturally indowed with a faculty by which it distinguished in certain actions and affections the qualities of right laudable and virtuous and in others those of wrong blameable and vitious  Law it was justly observed by Dr Cudworth  Immutable morality l  could not be the original source of those distinctions since upon the supposition of such a law it must either be right to obey it and wrong to disobey it or indifferent whether we obeyed it or disobeyed it That law which it was indifferent whether we obeyed or disobeyed could not it was evident be the source of those distinctions neither could that which it was right to obey and wrong to disobey since even this  supposed the antecedent notions or ideas of right and wrong and that obedience to the law was conformable to the idea of right and disobedience to that of wrong  Since the mind therefore had a notion  those distinctions antecedent to all law  seemed necessarily to follow that it deriv  this notion from reason which pointed out the difference between right and wrong in the same manner in which it did that between truth and falsehood and this conclusion which tho' true in some respects is rather hasty in others was more easily received at a time when the abstract science of human nature was but in its infancy and before the distinct offices and powers of the different faculties of the human mind had been carefully examined and distinguished from one another When this controversy with Mr Hobbs was carried on with the greatest warmth and keenness no other faculty had been thought of from which any such ideas could possibly  e supposed to arise It became at this time therefore the popular doctrine that the essence of virtue and vice did not consist in the conformity or disagreement of human actions with the law of a superior but in  heir conformity or disagreement with reason which was thus considered as the original  ource and principle of approbation and dis  pprobation  That virtue consists in conformity to reason is true in some respects and this faculty may very justly be considered as in some  ense the source and principle of approbation  and disapprobation and of all solid judgments concerning right and wrong It is by reason that we discover those general rules of justice by which we ought to regulate our actions and it is by the same faculty that we form those more vague and indeterminate ideas of what is prudent of what is decent of what is generous or noble which we carry constantly about with us and according to which we endeavour as well as we can to model the tenor of our conduct The general maxims of morality are formed like all other general maxims from experience and induction We observe in a great variety of particular cases what pleases or displeases our moral faculties what these approve or disapprove of and by induction from this experience we establish those general rules But induction is always regarded as one of the operations of reason From reason therefore we are very properly said to derive all those general maxims and ideas It is by these however that we regulate the greater part of our moral judgments which would be extremely uncertain and precarious if they depended altogether upon what is liable to so many variations as immediate sentiment and feeling which the different states of health  and humour are capable of altering so essentially As our most solid judgments therefore with regard to right and wrong are regulated by maxims and ideas derived from an induction of reason virtue may very properly be said to consist in a conformity to reason and so far this faculty may be considered as the source and principle of approbation and disapprobation  But tho' reason is undoubtedly the source of the general rules of morality and of all the moral judgments which we form by means of them it is altogether absurd and unintelligible to suppose that the first perceptions of right and wrong can be derived from reason even in those particular cases upon the experience of which the general rules are formed These first perceptions as well as all other experiments upon which any general rules are founded cannot be the object of reason but of immediate sense and feeling It is by finding in a vast variety of instances that one tenor of conduct constantly pleases in a certain manner and that another as constantly displeases the mind that we form the general rules of morality But reason cannot render any particular object either agreeable or disagreeable to the mind for its own sake  Reason may show that this object is the means of obtaining some other which is naturally either pleasing or displeasing and in this manner may render it either agreeable or disagreeable for the sake of something else But nothing can be agreeable or disagreeable for its own sake which is not rendered such by immediate sense and feeling If virtue therefore in every particular instance necessarily pleases for its own sake and if vice as certainly displeases the mind it cannot be reason but immediate sense and feeling which in this manner reconciles us to the one and alienates us from the other  Pleasure and pain are the great objects of desire and aversion but these are distinguished not by reason but by immediate sense and feeling If virtue therefore is desireable for its own sake and if vice is in the same manner the object of aversion it cannot be reason which originally distinguishes those different qualities but immediate sense and feeling  As reason however in a certain sense may justly be considered as the principle of approbation and disapprobation these sentiments were thro' inattention long regarded as originally flowing from the operations of  this faculty Dr Hutcheson had the merit of being the first who distinguished with any degree of precision in what respect all moral distinctions may be said to arise from reason and in what respect they are founded upon immediate sense and feeling In his illustrations upon the moral sense he has explained this so fully and in my opinion so unanswerably that if any controversy is still kept up about this subject I can impute it to nothing but either to inattention to what that gentleman has written or to a superstitious attachment for certain forms of expression a weakness not very uncommon among the  earned especially in subjects so deeply interesting as the present in which a man of virtue is often loath to abandon even the propriety of a single phrase which he has been accustomed to  CHAP III Of those systems which make sentiment the principle of approbation  THOSE systems which make sentiment the principle of approbation may be divided into two different classes  I According to some the principle of approbation is founded upon a sentiment of a peculiar nature upon a particular power of perception exerted by the mind at the view of certain actions or affections some of which affecting this faculty in an agreeable and others in a disagreeable manner the first are stampt with the characters of right laudable and virtuous the last with those of wrong blameable and vitious This sentiment being of a peculiar nature distinct from every other and the effect of a particular power of perception they give it a particular name and call it a moral sense  II According to others in order to account for the principle of approbation there is no occasion for supposing any new power of perception which had never been heard of  before nature they imagine acts here as in all other cases with the strictest oeconomy and produces a multitude of effects from one and the same cause and sympathy a power which has always been taken notice of and with which the mind is manifestly endowed is they think sufficient to account for all the effects ascribed to this peculiar faculty  I Dr Hutcheson  Enquiry concerning virtue  had been at great pains to prove that the principle of approbation was not founded on selflove He had demonstrated too that it could not arise from any operation of reason Nothing remained  he thought but to suppose it a faculty of a peculiar kind with which nature had endowed the human mind in order to produce this one particular and important effect When selflove and reason were both excluded it did not occur to him that there was any other known faculty of the mind which could in any respect answer this purpose  This new power of perception he called a moral sense and supposed it to be somewhat analogous to the external senses As the bodies around us by affecting these in a cer  ain manner appear to possess the different qualities of sound taste odour colour so  the various affections of the human mind by touching this particular faculty in a certain manner appear to possess the different qualities of amiable and odious of virtuous and vitious of right and wrong  The various senses or powers of perception  Treatise of the passions  from which the human mind derives all its simple ideas were according to this system of two different kinds of which the one were called the direct or antecedent the other the reflex or consequent senses The direct senses were those faculties from which the mind derived the perception of such species of things as did not presuppose the antecedent perception of any other Thus sounds and colours were objects of the direct senses To hear a sound or to see a colour does not presuppose the antecedent perception of any other quality or object The reflex or consequent senses on the other hand were those faculties from which the mind derived the perception of such species of things as presupposed the antecedent perception of some other Thus harmony and beauty were objects of the reflex senses In order to perceive the harmony of a sound or the beauty of a colour we must first perceive the sound  or the colour The moral sense was considered as a faculty of this kind That faculty which Mr Locke calls reflection and from which he derived the simple ideas of the different passions and emotions of the human mind was according to Dr Hutcheson a direct internal sense That faculty again by which we perceived the beauty or deformity the virtue or vice of those different passions and emotions was a reflex internal sense  Dr Hutcheson endeavoured still further to support this doctrine by shewing that it was agreeable to the analogy of nature and that the mind was endowed with a variety of other reflex senses exactly similar to the moral sense such as a sense of beauty and deformity in external objects a public sense by which we sympathize with the happiness or misery of our fellowcreatures a sense of shame and honour and a sense of ridicule  But notwithstanding all the pains which this ingenious philosopher has taken to prove that the principle of approbation is founded in a peculiar power of perception somewhat analogous to the external senses there are some consequences which he acknowledges to follow from this doctrine  that will perhaps be regarded by many as a sufficient confutation of it The qualities he allows  Illustrations upon the moral sense Sect page  seq Third Edition  which belong to the objects of any sense cannot without the greatest absurdity be ascribed to the sense itself Whoever thought of calling the sense of seeing black or white the sense of hearing loud or low or the sense of tasting sweet or bitter and according to him it is equally absurd to call our moral faculties virtuous or vicious morally good or evil These qualities belong to the objects of those faculties not to the faculties themselves If any man therefore was so absurdly constituted as to approve of cruelty and injustice as the highest virtues and to disapprove of equity and humanity as the most pitiful vices such a constitution of mind might indeed be regarded as inconvenient both to the individual and to the society and likewise as strange surprising and unnatural in itself but it could not without the greatest absurdity be denominated vicious or morally evil  Yet surely if we saw any man shouting with admiration and applause at a barbarous and unmerited execution which some insolent tyrant  had ordered we should not think we were guilty of any great absurdity in denominating  his behaviour vicious and morally evil in the highest degree tho' it expressed nothing but depraved moral faculties or an absurd approbation of this horrid action as of what was  oble magnanimous and great Our heart  imagine at the sight of such a spectator would forget for a while its sympathy with  he sufferer and feel nothing but horror and  etestation at the thought of so execrable a wretch We should abominate him even more than the tyrant who might be goaded  n by the strong passions of jealousy fear and  esentment and upon that account be more  xcusable But the sentiments of the spec  ator would appear altogether without cause  r motive and therefore most perfectly and  ompleatly detestable There is no perver  on of sentiment or affection which our heart would be more averse to enter into or which  would reject with greater hatred and indig  ation than one of this kind and so far from  egarding such a constitution of mind as being  eerly something strange or inconvenient and  ot in any respect vitious or morally evil we  should rather consider it as the very last and most dreadful stage of moral depravity  Correct moral sentiments on the contrary naturally appear in some degree laudable and morally good The man whose censure and applause are upon all occasions suited with the greatest accuracy to the value or unworthiness of the object seems to deserve a degree even of moral approbation We admire the delicate precision of his moral sentiments they lead our own judgments and upon account of their uncommon and surprizing justness they even excite our wonder and applause We cannot indeed be always sure that the conduct of such a person would be in any respect correspondent to the precision and accuracy of his judgments concerning the conduct of others Virtue requires habit and resolution of mind as well as delicacy of sentiment and unfortunately the former qualities are sometimes wanting where the latter is in the greatest perfection This disposition of mind however tho' it may sometimes be attended with imperfections is incompatible with any thing that is grosly criminal and is the happiest foundation upon which the superstructure of perfect virtue can be built There are many men who mean very well and seriously  propose to do what they think their duty who notwithstanding are disagreeable on account of the coarseness of their moral sentiments  It may be said perhaps that tho' the principle of approbation is not founded upon any power of perception that is in any respect analogous to the external senses it may still be founded upon a peculiar sentiment which answers this one particular purpose and no other Approbation and disapprobation it may be pretended are certain feelings or emotions which arise in the mind upon the view of different characters and actions and as resentment might be called a sense of injuries or gratitude a sense of benefits so these may very properly receive the name of a sense of right and wrong or of a moral sense  But this account of things tho' it may not  e liable to the same objections with the foregoing is exposed to others which are equally  nanswerable  First of all whatever variations any par  cular emotion may undergo it still preserves  general features which distinguish it to be  emotion of such a kind and these general  are always more striking and remark  ble than any variation which it may undergo  in particular cases Thus anger is an emotion of a particular kind and accordingly its general features are always more distinguishable than all the variations it undergoes in particular cases Anger against a man i  no doubt somewhat different from anger against a woman and that again from anger against a child In each of those three cases the general passion of anger receives a different modification from the particular character of its object as may easily be observed by the attentive But still the general features of the passion predominate in all these cases To distinguish these requires no nice observation a very delicate attention on the contrary is necessary to discover their variations every body takes notice of the former▪ scarce any body observes the latter If approbation and disapprobation therefore were like gratitude and resentment emotions of a particular kind distinct from every other we should expect that in all the variations which either of them might undergo it would  retain the general features which mark it  be an emotion of such a particular  clear plain and easily distinguishable  in fact it happens quite otherwise If  attend to what we really feel when upon  ferent  occasions we either approve or disapprove we shall find that our emotion in one case is often totally different from that in another and that no common features can possibly be discovered between them Thus the approbation with which we view a tender delicate and humane sentiment is quite different from that with which we are struck by one that appears great daring and magnanimous Our approbation of both may upon different occasions be perfect and intire  ut we are softened by the one and we are  levated by the other and there is no sort of  esemblance between the emotions which  hey excite in us But according to that  ystem which I have been endeavouring to  stablish this must necessarily be the case  s the emotions of the person whom we ap  rove of are quite opposite to one another  nd as our approbation arises from sympathy  ith those opposite emotions what we feel  pon the one occasion can have no sort of  semblance to what we feel upon the other  ut this could not happen if approbation  onsisted in a peculiar emotion which had no  ing in common with the sentiments we ap  oved of but which arose at the view of those  ntiments like any other passion at the view  of its proper object The same thing holds true with regard to disapprobation Our horror for cruelty has no sort of resemblance to our contempt for meanspiritedness It is quite a different species of discord which we feel at the view of those two different vices between our own minds and those of the person whose sentiments and behaviour we consider  Secondly I have already observed that not only the different passions or affections of the human mind that are approved or disapproved of appear morally good or evil but that proper and improper approbation appear to our natural sentiments to be stampt with the same characters I would ask therefore how it is that according to this system we approve or disapprove of proper or improper approbation To this question I imagine there is but one reasonable answer which can possibly be given It must be said th  when the approbation with which our neighbour regards the conduct of a third  coincides with our own we approve of his approbation and consider it as in some me  sure morally good and that on the contra  when it does not coincide with our own  timents we disapprove of it and consider  as in some measure morally evil It must be allowed therefore that at least in this one case the coincidence or opposition of sentiments between the observer and the person observed constitutes moral approbation or disapprobation And if it does so in this one case I would ask why not in every other or to what purpose imagine a new power of perception in order to account for those sentiments  Against every account of the principle of approbation which makes it depend upon a peculiar sentiment distinct from every other I would object that it is strange that this sentiment which providence undoubtedly intended to be the governing principle of human nature should hitherto have been so little taken notice of as not to have got a name in any language The word moral sense is of very late formation and cannot  et be considered as making part of the English tongue The word approbation has but within these few years been appropriated to  enote peculiarly any thing of this kind In  ropriety of language we approve of what  ver is entirely to our satisfaction of the form  f a building of the contrivance of a ma  hine of the flavour of a dish of meat The  word conscience does not immediately denote any moral faculty by which we approve or disapprove Conscience supposes indeed the existence of some such faculty and properly signifies our consciousness of having acted agreeably or contrary to its directions When love hatred joy sorrow gratitude resentment with so many other passions which are all supposed to be the subjects of this principle have made themselves considerable enough to get titles to know them by is it not surprizing that the sovereign of them all should hitherto have been so little heeded that a few philosophers excepted no body has yet thought it worth while to bestow a name upon it  When we approve of any character or action the sentiments which we feel are according to the foregoing system derived from four sources which are in some respects different from one another First we sympathize with the motives of the agent secondly we enter into the gratitude of those  receive the benefit of his actions thirdly we observe that his conduct has been agreeable to the general rules by which those  sympathies generally act and last of  when we consider such actions as making▪  part of a system of behaviour which tends to promote the happiness either of the individual or of the society they appear to derive a beauty from this utility not unlike that which we ascribe to any well contrived machine After deducting in any one particular case all that must be acknowledged to proceed from some one or other of these four principles I should be glad to know what remains and I shall freely allow this overplus to be ascribed to a moral sense or to any other peculiar faculty provided any body will ascertain precisely what this overplus is It might be expected perhaps that if there was any such peculiar principle such as this moral sense is supposed to be we should feel it in some particular cases separated and detached from every other as we often feel joy sorrow hope and fear pure and unmixed with any other emotion This however I imagine cannot even be pretended I have never heard any instance alledged in which this principle could be said to exert itself alone and  nmixed with sympathy or antipathy with gratitude or resentment with the perception  f the agreement or disagreement of any ac  ion to an established rule or last of all with  that general taste for beauty and order which is excited by inanimated as well as by animated objects  II There is another system which attempts to account for the origin of our moral sentiments from sympathy distinct from that which I have been endeavouring to establish It is that which places virtue in utility and accounts for the pleasure with which the spectator surveys the utility of any quality from sympathy with the happiness of those who are affected by it This sympathy is different both from that by which we enter into the motives of the agent and from that by which we go along with the gratitude of the persons who are benefited by his actions It is the same principle with that by which we approve of a well contrived machine But no machine can be the object of either of those two last mentioned sympathies I have already in the fourth part of this discourse given some account of this system  SECTION IV Of the manner in which different authors have treated of the practical rules of morality  IT was observed in the third part of this discourse that the rules of justice are  he only rules of morality which are precise  nd accurate that those of all the other vir  ues are loose vague and indeterminate  hat the first may be compared to the rules  f grammar the others to those which  ritics lay down for the attainment of what  sublime and elegant in composition and which present us rather with a general idea  f the perfection we ought to aim at than  fford us any certain and infallible directions  acquiring it  As the different rules of morality admit  uch different degrees of accuracy those  uthors who have endeavoured to collect and  igest them into systems have done it in two  ifferent manners and one set has followed  rough the whole that loose method to which  ey were naturally directed by the consideration  of one species of virtues while another has as universally endeavoured to introduce into their precepts that sort of accuracy of which only some of them are susceptible The first have wrote like critics the second like grammarians  I The first among whom we may count all the antient moralists have contented themselves with describing in a general manner the different vices and virtues and with pointing out the deformity and misery of the one disposition as well as the propriety and happiness of the other but have not affected to lay down many precise rules that are to hold good unexceptionably in all particular cases They have only endeavoured to ascertain as far as language is capable of ascertaining first wherein consists the sentiment of the heart upon which each particular virtue is founded what sort of internal feeling or emotion it is which constitutes the essence of friendship of humanity of generosity of justice of magnanimity and of all the other virtues as well as of the vices which are opposed to them and secondly What is the general way of acting the ordinary tone and tenor of conduct to which each of those sentiments would direct us or how it is that a friendly  a generous a brave a just and a humane man would upon ordinary occasions chuse to act  To characterize the sentiment of the heart upon which each particular virtue is founded tho' it requires both a delicate and an accurate pencil is a task however which may be executed with some degree of exactness It is impossible indeed to express all the variations which each sentiment either does or ought to undergo according to every possible variation of circumstances They are endless and language wants names to mark them by The sentiment of friendship for example which we feel for an old man is different from that which we feel for a young that which we entertain for an austere man different from that which we feel for one of softer and gentler manners and that again from what we feel for one of gay vivacity and spirit The friendship which we conceive for a man is different from that with which a woman affects us even where there is no mixture of any grosser passion Who could enumerate and ascertain these and all the other infinite varieties which this sentiment is capable of undergoing But still the general sentiment of friendship and familiar  attachment that is common to them all may be ascertained with a sufficient degree of accuracy The picture that is drawn of it tho' it will always be in many respects incompleat may however have such a resemblance as to make us know the original when we meet with it and even distinguish it from other sentiments to which it has a considerable resemblance such as goodwill respect esteem admiration  To describe in a general manner what is the ordinary way of acting to which each virtue would prompt us is still more easy It is indeed scarce possible to describe the internal sentiment or emotion upon which it is founded without doing something of this kind It is impossible by language to express if I may say so the invisible features of all the different modifications of passion as they show themselves within There is no other way of marking and distinguishing them from one another but by describing the effects which they produce without the alterations which they occasion in the countenance in the air and external behaviour the resolutions they suggest the actions they prompt to It is thus that Cicero in the first book of his offices endeavours to direct us to the practice of the four cardinal virtues and that Aristotle  in the practical parts of his ethics points out to us the different habits by which he would have us regulate our behaviour such as liberality magnificence magnanimity and even jocularity and good humour qualities which that indulgent philosopher has thought worthy of a place in the catalogue of the virtues tho' the lightness of that approbation which we naturally bestow upon them should not seem to entitle them to so venerable a name  Such works present us with agreeable and lively pictures of manners By the vivacity of their descriptions they inflame our natural love of virtue and increase our abhorrence of vice by the justness as well as delicacy of their observations they may often help both to correct and to ascertain our natural sentiments with regard to the propriety of conduct and suggesting many nice and delicate attentions form us to a more exact justness of behaviour than what without such instruction we should have been apt to think of In treating of the rules of morality in this manner consists the science which is properly called ethics a science which tho' like criticism it does not admit of the most accurate precision is however both highly useful and agreeable It is of  all others the most susceptible of the embellishments of eloquence and by means of them of bestowing if that be possible a new importance upon the smallest rules of duty Its precepts when thus dressed and adorned are capable of producing upon the flexibility of youth the noblest and most lasting impressions and as they fall in with the natural magnanimity of that generous age they are able to inspire for a time at least the most heroic resolutions and thus tend both to establish and confirm the best and most useful habits of which the mind of man is susceptible Whatever precept and exhortation can do to animate us to the practice of virtue is done by this science delivered in this manner  II The second set of moralists among whom we may count all the casuists of the middle and latter ages of the christian church as well as all those who in this and in the preceeding century have treated of what is called natural jurisprudence do not content themselves with characterizing in this general manner that tenor of conduct which they would recommend to us but endeavour to lay down exact and precise rules for the direction of every circumstance of our behaviour As justice is the only virtue with regard  to which such exact rules can properly be given it is this virtue that has chiefly fallen under the consideration of those two different sets of writers They treat of it however in a very different manner  Those who write upon the principles of Jurisprudence consider only what the person to whom the obligation is due ought to think himself entitled to exact by force what every impartial spectator would approve of him for exacting or what a judge or arbiter to whom he had submitted his case and who had undertaken to do him justice ought to oblige the other person to suffer or to perform The casuists on the other hand do not so much examine what it is that might properly be exacted by force as what it is that the person who owes the obligation ought to think himself bound to perform from the most sacred and scrupulous regard to the general rules of justice and from the most conscientious dread either of wronging his neighbour or of violating the integrity of his own character It is the end of jurisprudence to prescribe rules for the decisions of judges and arbiters It is the end of casuistry to prescribe rules for the conduct of a good man By observing all the rules of jurisprudence supposing  them ever so perfect we should deserve nothing but to be free from external punishment By observing those of casuistry supposing them such as they ought to be we should be entitled to considerable praise by the exact and scrupulous delicacy of our behaviour  It may frequently happen that a good man ought to think himself bound from a sacred and conscientious regard to the general rules of justice to perform many things which it would be the highest injustice to extort from him or for any judge or arbiter to impose upon him by force To give a trite example a highwayman by the fear of death obliges a traveller to promise him a certain sum of money Whether such a promise extorted in this manner by unjust force ought to be regarded as obligatory is a question that has been very much debated  If we consider it meerly as a question of jurisprudence the decision can admit of no doubt It would be absurd to suppose that the highwayman can be entitled to use force to constrain the other to perform To extort the promise was a crime that deserved the highest punishment and to extort the performance would only be adding a new crime  to the former He can complain of no injury who has only been deceived by the person by whom he might justly have been killed To suppose that a judge ought to enforce the obligation of such promises or that the magistrate ought to allow them to sustain action at law would be the most ridiculous of all absurdities If we consider this question therefore as a question of jurisprudence we can be at no loss about the decision  But if we consider it as a question of casuistry it will not be so easily determined Whether a good man from a conscientious regard to that most sacred rule of justice which commands the observance of all serious promises would not think himself bound to perform is at least much more doubtful That no regard is due to the disappointment of the wretch who brings him into this situation that no injury is done to the robber and consequently that nothing can be extorted by force will admit of no sort of dispute But whether some regard is not in this case due to his own dignity and honour to the inviolable sacredness of that part of his character which makes him reverence the law of truth and abhor every thing that approaches to treachery and falsehood may  perhaps more reasonably be made a question The casuists accordingly are greatly divided about it One party with whom we may count Cicero among the antients among the moderns Puffendorf Barbeyrac his commentator and above all the late Dr Hutcheson one who in most cases was by no means a loose casuist determine without any hesitation that no sort of regard is due to any such promise and that to think otherwise is meer weakness and superstition Another party among whom we may reckon  St Augustine la Placette  some of the antient fathers of the church as well as some very eminent modern casuists have been of another opinion and have judged all such promises obligatory  If we consider the matter according to the common sentiments of mankind we shall find that some regard would be thought due even to a promise of this kind but that it is impossible to determine how much by any general rule that will apply to all cases without exception The man who was quite frank and easy in making promises of this kind and who violated them with as little ceremony we should not chuse for our friend and companion  A gentleman who should promise a highwayman five pounds and not perform would incur some blame If the sum promised however was very great it might be more doubtful what was proper to be done If it was such for example that the payment of it would entirely ruin the family of the promiser if it was so great as to be sufficient for promoting the most useful purposes it would appear in some measure criminal at least extremely improper to throw it for the sake of a punctilio into such worthless hands The man who should beggar himself or who should throw away a hundred thousand pounds tho' he could afford that vast sum for the sake of observing such a parole with a thief would appear to the common sense of mankind absurd and extravagant in the highest degree Such profusion would seem inconsistent with his duty with what he owed both to himself and others and what therefore regard to a promise extorted in this manner could by no means authorize To fix however by any precise rule what degree of regard ought to be paid to it or what might be the greatest sum which could be due from it is evidently impossible This would vary according to  the characters of the persons according to their circumstances according to the solemnity of the promise and even according to the incidents of the rencounter and if the promiser had been treated with a great deal of that sort of gallantry which is sometimes to be met with in persons of the most abandoned characters more would seem due than upon other occasions It may be said in general that exact propriety requires the observance of all such promises wherever it is not inconsistent with some other duties that are more sacred such as regard to the public interest to those whom gratitude whom natural affection or whom the laws of proper beneficence should prompt us to provide for But as was formerly taken notice of we have no precise rules to determine what external actions are due from a regard to such motives nor consequently when it is that those virtues are inconsistent with the observance of such promises  It is to be observed however that whenever such promises are violated tho' for the most necessary reasons it is always with some degree of dishonour to the person who made them After they are made we may be convinced of the impropriety of observing them  But still there is some fault in having made them It is at least a departure from the highest and noblest maxims of magnanimity and honour A brave man ought to die rather than make a promise which he can neither keep without folly nor violate without Ignominy For some degree of ignominy always attends a situation of this kind Treachery and falsehood are vices so dangerous so dreadful and at the same time such as may so easily and upon many occasions so safely be indulged that we are more jealous of them than of almost any other Our imagination therefore attaches the idea of shame to all violations of faith in every circumstance and in every situation They resemble in this respect the violations of chastity in the fair sex a virtue of which for the like reasons we are excessively jealous and our sentiments are not more delicate with regard to the one than with regard to the other Breach of chastity dishonours irretriveably No circumstances no sollicitation can excuse it no sorrow no repentance atone for it We are so nice in this respect that even a rape dishonours and the innocence of the mind cannot in our imagination wash out the pollution of the body It is the same case with the violation  of faith when it has been solemnly pledged even to the most worthless of mankind Fidelity is so necessary a virtue that we apprehend it in general to be due even to those to whom nothing else is due and whom we think it lawful to kill and destroy It is to no purpose that the person who has been guilty of the breach of it urges that he promised in order to save his life and that he broke his promise because it was inconsistent with some other respectable duty to keep it These circumstances may alleviate but cannot entirely wipe out his dishonour He appears to have been guilty of an action with which in the imaginations of men some degree of shame is inseparably connected He has broke a promise which he had solemnly averred he would maintain and his character if not irretrievably stained and polluted has at least a ridicule affixed to it which it will be very difficult entirely to efface and no man I imagine who had gone thro' an adventure of this kind would be fond of telling the story  This instance may serve to show wherein consists the difference between casuistry and jurisprudence even when both of them consider  the obligations of the general rules of justice  But tho' this difference be real and essential tho' those two sciences propose quite different ends the sameness of the subject has made such a similarity between them that the greater part of authors whose professed design was to treat of jurisprudence have determined the different questions they examine sometimes according to the principles of that science and sometimes according to those of casuistry without distinguishing and perhaps without being themselves aware when they did the one and when the other  The doctrine of the casuists however is by no means confined to the consideration of what a conscientious regard to the general rules of justice would demand of us It embraces many other parts of christian and moral duty What seems principally to have given occasion to the cultivation of this species of science was the custom of auricular confession introduced by the Roman Catholic superstition in times of barbarism and ignorance By that institution the most secret actions and even the thoughts of every person which could be suspected of receeding in the smallest degree from the rules of christian  purity were to be revealed to the confessor The confessor informed his penitents whether and in what respect they had violated their duty and what pennance it behooved them to undergo before he could absolve them in the name of the offended deity  The consciousness or even the suspicion of having done wrong is a load upon every mind and is accompanied with anxiety and terror in all those who are not hardened by long habits of iniquity Men in this as in all other distresses are naturally eager to disburden themselves of the oppression which they feel upon their thoughts by unbosoming the agony of their mind to some person whose secrecy and discretion they can confide in The shame which they suffer from this acknowledgment is fully compensated by that alleviation of their uneasiness which the sympathy of their confident seldom fails to occasion It relieves them to find that they are not altogether unworthy of regard and that however their past conduct may be censured their present disposition is at least approved of and is perhaps sufficient to compensate the other at least to maintain them in some degree of esteem with their friend A numerous and artful clergy had in those  times of superstition insinuated themselves into the confidence of almost every private family They possessed all the little learning which the times could afford and their manners tho' in many respects rude and disorderly were polished and regular compared with those of the age they lived in They were regarded therefore not only as the great directors of all religious but of all moral duties Their familiarity gave reputation to whoever was so happy as to possess it and every mark of their disapprobation stamped the deepest ignominy upon all who had the misfortune to fall under it Being considered as the great judges of right and wrong they were naturally consulted about all scruples that occurred and it was reputable for any person to have it known that he made those holy men the confidents of all such secrets and took no important or delicate step in his conduct without their advice and approbation It was not difficult for the clergy therefore to get it established as a general rule that they should be entrusted with what it had already become fashionable to entrust them and with what they generally would have been entrusted tho' no such rule  had been established To qualify themselves for confessors became thus a necessary part of the study of churchmen and divines and they were thence led to collect what are called cases of conscience nice and delicate situations in which it is hard to determine whereabouts the propriety of conduct may lie Such works they imagined might be of use both to the directors of consciences and to those who were to be directed and hence the origin of books of casuistry  The moral duties which fell under the consideration of the casuists were chiefly those which can in some measure at least be circumscribed within general rules and of which the violation is naturally attended with some degree of remorse and some dread of suffering punishment The design of that institution which gave occasion to their works was to appease those terrors of conscience which attend upon the infringement of such duties But it is not every virtue of which the defect is accompanied with any very severe compunctions of this kind and no man applies to his confessor for absolution because he did not perform the most generous the most friendly or the most  magnanimous action which in his circumstances it was possible to perform In failures of this kind the rule that is violated is commonly not very determinate and is generally of such a nature too that tho' the observance of it might entitle to honour and reward the violation seems to expose to no positive blame censure or punishment The exercise of such virtues the casuists seem to have regarded as a sort of works of supererogation which could not be very strictly exacted and which it was therefore unnecessary for them to treat of  The breaches of moral duty therefore which came before the tribunal of the confessor and upon that account fell under the cognizance of the casuists were chiefly of three different kinds  First and principally breaches of the rules of justice The rules here are all express and positive and the violation of them is naturally attended with the consciousness of deserving and the dread of suffering punishment both from God and man  Secondly breaches of the rules of chastity These in all grosser instances are real breaches of the rules of justice and no person can be  guilty of them without doing the most unpardonable injury to some other In smaller instances when they amount only to a violation of those exact decorums which ought to be observed in the conversation of the two sexes they cannot indeed justly be considered as violations of the rules of justice They are generally however violations of a pretty plain rule and at least in one of the sexes tend to bring ignominy upon the person who has been guilty of them and consequently to be attended in the scrupulous with some degree of shame and contrition of mind  Thirdly breaches of the rules of veracity The violation of truth it is to be observed is not always a breach of justice tho' it is so upon many occasions and consequently can not always expose to any external punishment The vice of common lying tho' a most miserable meanness may frequently do hurt to no person and in this case no claim of vengeance or satisfaction can be due either to the persons imposed upon or to others But though the violation of truth is not always a breach of justice it is always a breach of a very plain rule and what naturally tends  to cover with shame the person who has been guilty of it The great pleasure of conversation and indeed of society arises from a certain correspondence of sentiments and opinions from a certain harmony of minds which like so many musical instruments coincide and keep time with one another But this most delightful harmony cannot be obtained unless there is a free communication of sentiments and opinions We all desire upon this account to feel how each other is affected to penetrate into each others bosoms and to observe the sentiments and affections which really subsist there The man who indulges us in this natural passion who invites us into his heart who as it were sets open the gates of his breast to us seems to exercise a species of hospitality more delightful than any other No man who is in ordinary good temper can fail of pleasing if he has the courage to utter his real sentiments as he feels them and because he feels them It is this unreserved sincerity which renders even the prattle of a child agreeable How weak and imperfect soever the views of the openhearted we take pleasure to enter into them and endeavour as much as we can  to bring down our own understanding to the level of their capacities and to regard every subject in the particular light in which they appear to have considered it This passion to discover the real sentiments of others is naturally so strong that it often degenerates into a troublesome and impertinent curiosity to pry into those secrets of our neighbours which they have very justifiable reasons for concealing and upon many occasions it requires prudence and a strong sense of propriety to govern this as well as all the other passions of human nature and to reduce it to that pitch which any impartial spectator can approve of To disappoint this curiosity however when it is kept within proper bounds and aims at nothing which there can be any just reason for concealing is equally disagreeable in its turn The man who eludes our most innocent questions who gives no satisfaction to our most inoffensive inquiries who plainly wraps himself up in impenetrable obscurity seems as it were to build a wall about his breast We run forward to get within it with all the eagerness of harmless curiosity and feel ourselves all at once pushed back with the rudest and most  offensive violence If to conceal is so disagreeable to attempt to deceive us is still more disgusting even tho' we could possibly suffer nothing by the success of the fraud If we see that our companion wants to impose upon us if the sentiments and opinions which he utters appear evidently not to be his own let them be ever so fine we can derive no sort of entertainment from them and if something of human nature did not now and then transpire through all the covers which falshood and affectation are capable of wraping around it a puppet of wood would be altogether as pleasant a companion as a person who never spoke as he was affected No man ever deceives with regard to the most insignificant matters who is not conscious of doing something like an injury to those he converses with and who does not inwardly blush and shrink back with shame and confusion even at the secret thought of a detection Breach of veracity therefore being always attended with some degree of remorse and selfcondemnation naturally fell under the cognizance of the casuists  The chief subjects of the works of the casuists therefore were the conscientious  regard that is due to the rules of justice how far we ought to respect the life and property of our neighbour the duty of restitution the laws of chastity and modesty and wherein consisted what in their language are called the sins of concupiscence the rules of veracity and the obligation of oaths promises and contracts of all kinds  It may be said in general of the works of the casuists that they attempted to no purpose to direct by precise Rules what it belongs to feeling and sentiment only to judge of How is it possible to ascertain by rules the exact point at which in every case a delicate sense of justice begins to run into a frivolous and weak scrupulosity of conscience When it is that secrecy and reserve begin to grow into dissimulation How far an agreeable irony may be carried and at what precise point it begins to degenerate into a detestable lie What is the highest pitch of freedom and ease of behaviour which can be regarded as graceful and becoming and when it is that it first begins to run into a negligent and thoughtless licentiousness With regard to all such matters what would hold good in any one case  would scarce do so exactly in any other and what constitutes the propriety and happiness of behaviour varies in every case with the smallest variety of situation Books of casuistry therefore are generally as useless as they are commonly tiresome They could be of little use to one who should consult them upon occasion even supposing their decisions to be just because notwithstanding the multitude of cases collected in them yet upon account of the still greater variety of possible circumstances it is a chance if among all those cases there be found one exactly parallel to that under consideration One who is really anxious to do his duty must be very weak if he can imagine that he has much occasion for them and with regard to one who is negligent of it the stile of those writings is not such as is likely to awaken him to more attention None of them tend to animate us to what is generous and noble None of them tend to soften us to what is gentle and humane Many of them on the contrary tend rather to teach us to chicane with our own consciences and by their vain subtilties serve to authorise innumerable evasive refinements with regard  to the most essential articles of our duty That frivolous accuracy which they attempted to introduce into subjects which do not admit of it almost necessarily betrayed them into those dangerous errors and at the same time rendered their works dry and disagree  ble abounding in abstruse and metaphysical distinctions but incapable of exciting in the heart any of those emotions which it is the principal use of books of morality to excite  The two useful parts of moral philosophy therefore are Ethics and Jurisprudence casuistry ought to be rejected altogether and the ancient moralists appear to have judged much better who in treating of the same subjects did not affect any such nice exactness but contented themselves with describing in a general manner what is the sentiment upon which justice modesty and verasity are founded and what is the ordinary way of acting to which those virtues would commonly prompt us  Something indeed not unlike the doctrine of the casuists seems to have been attempted by several philosophers There is something of this kind in the third book of Cicero's offices  where he endeavours like a casuist to give rules for our conduct in many nice cases in which it is difficult to determine whereabouts the point of propriety may lie It appears too from many passages in the same book that several other philosophers had attempted something of the same kind before him Neither he nor they however appear to have aimed at giving a compleat system of this sort but only meant to show how situations may occur in which it is doubtful whether the highest propriety of conduct consists in observing or in receeding from what in ordinary cases are the rules of duty  Every system of positive law may be regarded as a more or less imperfect attempt towards a system of natural jurisprudence or towards an enumeration of the particular rules of justice As the violation of justice is what men will never submit to from one another the publick magistrate is under a necessity of employing the power of the commonwealth to enforce the practice of this virtue Without this precaution civil society would become a scene of bloodshed and disorder every man revenging himself at his own hand whenever he fancied he was injured  To prevent the confusion which would attend upon every man's doing justice to himself the magistrate in all governments that have acquired any considerable authority undertakes to do justice to all and promises to hear and to redress every complaint of injury In all wellgoverned states too not only judges are appointed for determining the controversies of individuals but rules are prescribed for regulating the decisions of those judges and these rules are in general intended to coincide with those of natural justice It does not indeed always happen that they do so in every instance Sometimes what is called the constitution of the state that is the interest of the government sometimes the interest of particular orders of men who tyrannize the government warp the positive laws of the country from what natural justice would prescribe In some countries the rudeness and barbarism of the people hinder the natural sentiments of justice from arriving at that accuracy and precision which in more civilised nations they naturally attain to Their laws are like their manners gross and rude and undistinguishing In other countries the unfortunate constitution of their courts of judicature hinders any regular system of jurisprudence  from ever establishing itself among them tho' the improved manners of the people may be such as would admit of the most accurate In no country do the decisions of positive law coincide exactly in every case with the rules which the natural sense of justice would dictate Systems of positive law therefore tho' they deserve the greatest authority as the records of the sentiments of mankind in different ages and nations yet can never be regarded as accurate systems of the rules of natural justice  It might have been expected that the reasonings of lawyers upon the different imperfections and improvements of the laws of different countries should have given occasion to an enquiry into what were the natural rules of justice independent of all positive institution It might have been expected that these reasonings should have led them to aim at establishing a system of what might properly be called natural jurisprudence or a theory of the general principles which ought to run through and be the foundation of the laws of all nations But tho' the reasonings of lawyers did produce something of this  kind and though no man has treated systematically of the laws of any particular country without intermixing in his work many observations of this sort it was very late in the world before any such general system was thought of or before the philosophy of law was treated of by itself and without regard to the particular institutions of any one nation In none of the ancient moralists do we find any attempt towards a particular enumeration of the rules of justice Cicero in his offices and Aristotle in his ethics treat of justice in the same general manner in which they treat of all the other virtues In the laws of Cicero and Plato where we might naturally have expected some attempts towards an enumeration of those rules of natural equity which ought to be enforced by the positive laws of every country there is however nothing of this kind Their laws are laws of police not of justice Grotius seems to have been the first who attempted to give the world any thing like a system of those principles which ought to run thro' and be the foundation of the laws of all nations and his treatise of the laws of war and peace with all its imperfections is perhaps  at this day the most compleat work that has yet been given upon this subject I shall in another discourse endeavour to give an account of the general principles of law and government and of the different revolutions they have undergone in the different ages and periods of society not only in what concerns justice but in what concerns police revenue and arms and whatever else is the object of law I shall not therefore at present enter into any further detail concerning the history of jurisprudence  FINIS  ERRATA  Page  Line         as they themselves must do
