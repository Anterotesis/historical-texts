miscarrying in the necessary Attempt join'd to the Charms of my fair Instructress have banish'd Sleep as far from my Eyes as Possession of the dear Object wou'd Sorrow from my Heart What an unaccountable Revolution has this Girl caused in me One Evening's Conversation has metamorphos'd me from the avow'd Friend of Dissipation and Riot to an unalterable Advocate for Matrimony domestic

Gilbert  up and garter'd before Eleven Why what in the name of the Lark makes you such an early Riser Perhaps bad Wine and worse Company had Charms sufficient to rival your Pillow and keep you up all Night  Gilb  Not so upon my Honour I went soberly to Rest at Twelve but my Pillow and I never agreed worse There was no Part of it cou'd please me But when I account for our Quarrel you will certainly indulge in a hearty Laugh In short after I left you at  George  's I went to  Ranelagh  where  Townly  introduc'd me to one of the most amiable elegant sprightly bewitching Femalesthat ever made Mortal melancholy  Mode  But  Ned  I shou'd suppose her more than Mortal that cou'd make you so  Gilb  Never was Man so chang'd I drew  Townly  aside made a short Inquiry into her Family and Character and finding both unexceptionable I made a formal Declaration of an honourable Passion which the dear Girl receiv'd in a most easy open becoming Manner  Mode  But pray did  Townly  introduce you by your real Name of  Gilbert  Gilb  No noas Mr  George Heartly  the Name by which I pass here at my Lodging For he knows  shou'd the News of my being from  Oxford  reach  Norfolk  the old Gentleman might be in the Pouts But to proceedShe told me she was generally close confin'd by her Father who was then in the Country on some Family Business that Gold given to her Keeper had procur'd her a short Jubilee that wou'd expire at her Father's Return which was expected almost as soon as her's  Mode  Oh provoking Then you have seen your last of her for a Time at least  Gilb  Not so I hope neither I am just going to visit her in Masquerade If you will step into the next Room with me while I equip myself I'll let you into our whole Plot  Mode  I attend you  Exeunt  Gilbert  and  Modely  Smatter  alone  Smat  Well this is as strange a Metamorphosis as any in  Ovid  but I believe it is only the Forerunner of another A Month's Possession of the desired Object will convince him however easily trapp'd he is not long to be caged Love quotha he has been as often in love as he calls it as I have been at short Commons and has changed his Mind much oftener than I my Livery I thought something was gathering in the Wind when I let him in last Night He was very eager to get to Bed too which is never the Case but when his Heart's full or his Purse empty I foresee a World of Difficulty in this Business So much the betterfor as he has but few Friends in Town I must needs be a Party in the Plotand when once I am deeply engag'd in the Secretif I don't get well paid for keeping it why thenBut hold Will that be honest May be not but 'twill be very convenient and that's the first Thing to be consider'd  AIR II  Daniel Cooper  Since I the Motley Garb put on  Iv'e serv'd in Places twenty  To Brothel with my Lord have gone  To Church with Lady  Dainty  And still for each wou'd Pimp or Pray  Think both by Turns my Duty  In short to few Things wou'd say nay  Cou'd I secure a Booty  For this in Courts the Lawyer pleads  The Sa lor ploughs the Ocean  For this the Soldier bravely bleeds  And Doctor gives his Potion  See gilded Vice his Splendour wear  Poor Honesty in Tatters  Then why shou'd I a Phantom fear  I'll imitate my Betters  Exit  SCENE a Chamber in Mr  Lockworth  's House  Enter  Celia  and  Lucy  Celia  My dear  Lucy  start no more Objections for I am determined to be pleased with the Adventure His Address so easy his Conversation so engaging and when he made the wishedfor Declaration it was attended with such Openness and at the same Time such unaffected Delicacy that I soon bad adieu to Reserve and gave him ample Leave to hope the best I laid before nim the Difficulty of a Correspondence but at that Instant  Cupid  be thanked I thought of an Expedient to introduce him  I expect him presently in the Disguise of a foreign Tutor lately recommended to my Father If the real Master should make his Appearance we must employ my Gold and your Smiles upon that old Hypocrite  Robin  and so get him dismissed  Lucy  Well Fortune favour us Indeed Madam I am as impatient to gain my Liberty as you can be I would not purchase it at the Price of leaving you in this Extremity but I cannot pay myself so ill a Compliment as to suppose I am fit for nothing but to be immur'd in this Manner and condemned to bear the Whims of your Father and the odious Addresses of his superannuated Privy Counsellor  Celia  Courage Girl we shall soonMum  Enter  Lockworth  and  Gilbert  as the Language Master    Lock  Sir to tell you the Truth my chief Travels were a few Trips to the  WestIndies  where you may be sure I could not gain any great Knowledge of your polite Languages or practice many of your  Congès  But I take it for granted as you are

will find I know my Presence is an Interruption to your Proceedings so I shall go down Stairs and leave you to make the best you can of her  Exit  Lockworth  Celia  Well Sir you sufficiently relish the Project I find to undertake it after a whole Night's Reflection  Gilb  That Night's Reflection Madam served only to convince me that I should face Danger in this or any Shape to be admitted to your Presence and cheerfully submit to any Change of Figure▪ to prove my Heart unalterable  AIR III  The newflown Birds  The Sun's gay Metal shining Gold  In many Shapes is shewn  The Form though varied in the Mould  The standard Worth's still known  So I my Fair to please and gain  Would many Changes prove  Through all a constant Heart maintain  That Heart should all be Love  Celia  Alas Sir I well know Courtship and Honeymoon are gay rapturous Seasons but conjugal Life has in it many a dull Winter Evening And it often happens after a few Weeks Possession the seeming constant cooing Turtle turns out a very libertine Sparw  AIR IV  In all the Sex some Charms I find  The Knot once ty'd too ost we find  A Change soon follow in the Mind  Of each young sighing Lover  The Nymph belov'd once made a Wife  Finds all her Pleasure turn'd to Strife  And Spouse an arrant Rover  However Sir the Step I have taken must convince you I am more than pleas'd with your Protestations and will shortly if our Plan succeeds give you an Opportunity to prove their Sincerity  Gilb  But should we be discover'd say will you on the first Occasion bid adieu to your Prison and fly to Freedom and your

again in Favour of Sir  Humphry Ringwood  No no this is a lively Lad a fine young Fellow a stripling of Fortunc  Celia  The best Fortune Sir that can befall me is the Gift of pleasing you And I hope a Refusal of your present intended Kindness will not lessen the Tenderness you have ever shewn me The Gentleman you mention may be every Way worthy of a better Lot but as I am yet a Stranger to him and his Qualifications I cannot be sudden in my Determination  Lock  I tell you what  Celia  you may have Rhetoric but I have Power Mr  Trapwell  is below who will let you into the whole Affair I desire you will come down to us immediately I shall not say more to you at present because I wou'd not have you appear chagrin'd but mark me  Celia  I will be obey'd  Exit  Celia  You will be obey'd I will

Chamber  Gilbert  's Lodging  Enter  Modely  and  Gilbert  Mode  Nay prithee  Ned  don't be peevish the old Gentleman's Entrance was a little Mal apropos to be sure but you have been addmitted without Suspicion and under Favour of your Disguise may renew your Visit  Gilb  But not immediately and an Hour's Absence seems Eternity Oh Frank  Mode  Nay nay keep your Raptures for your MistressCommon Sense will content me Has your Fellow  Smatter  told you the News  Gilb  News What News  Mode  Nay 'tis not of the agreeable Kind I promise you He met one of your Father's Servants this Morning  Gilb  In Town  Mode  Yes but the Dog was arch enough to tell the Clodpole you had discharged him so he has no Suspicion of your being in London But the worst is to come In short your Father is on the Road in his Way hither  Gilb  'Sdeath you alarm me But no Matter If he does not take it in his Head to pay a Visit to Oxford I am safe still I'm on Thorns to know what that Business of Consequence was that the old Hunks wanted to open to his Daughter  Mode  Pray does your Uneasiness proceed from Curiosity or Jealousy May be a Compound of both I hear he was lately very urgent with her in behalf of a Country Baronet  Gilb  Who O Sir  Humphry Ringwood  Ay she gave me a short History of that Affair last Night If I had no other Obstacle I shou'd have very little Doubt of Success  Enter  Smatter  Smat  Sir here's a Letter for you  Delivers it and Exit  Gilb  From whence  opens it  Celia Lockworth  Blessing on the Hand Now for the Contents  Reads  Sir  My Father's Business was as important as disagreeable There has been a Relation with him one Mr  Trapwell  of  Oxford  who has given him Information of a young Gentleman's Arrival in Town whose Name is  Gilbert  He mentions him as a Man of great Fortune and has promis'd on his Return from  Colchester  for which Place he has just set off to introduce him to our Family My Father seems consident a Meeting will produce a Match But on my putting a few Negatives on the Matter he has thought sit to confine me  closer than ever I am not to see any Body so your Disguise will avail but little It is with Difficulty I write and send this On any Alteration will endeavour to give you the earliest Notice  Celia Lockworth  Gilb  So I am my own Rival at last A very whimsical Circumstance  Mode  A very lucky one I think for now you have nothing to do but to make an immediate Discovery of your Situation to the old Fellow and the Affair will undoubtedly take a favourable Turn  Gilb  I am not very clear in that What you mention might produce the desir'd Effect if I had not appear'd before him in my borrow'd Shape which you are sensible must make a Part of the Explanation And who knows but such a Step may in his Eyes give me too much the Air of an Adventurer and lead him to make Inquiries which you know will not be at all convenient Nay he may think it necessary to consult my Father and if in the End it should not prove agreeable to my old Gentleman I shall repent my frank Confession as it will undoubtedly deprive me of all future Opportunities of visiting  Celia  in my feign'd Character and I am determin'd not to give her up  Mode  What you say is very true Nay perhaps she too may think you have dealt rather indirectly and have  her  Suspicions  Gilb  None but what a Quarter of an Hour's Conversation will removeBut how to gain that Egad I have a ThoughtSuppose I make my Rascal  Smatter  personate me He may find a thousand Ways of introducing himself This will at least give me an Opportunity of conveying the Situation of Affairs in a Letter to the dear Girl Nay perhaps procure her Liberty which if she makes a proper Use of we'll put the finishing Stroke to the Affair before the Return of my  Oxford  Friend  Trapwell  And when my Father arrives the three old Fellows  may lay their wise Heads together and make the best on't  Mode  But is  Smatter  equal to the Undertaking  Gilb  O the Dog's intelligent enough  Smatter  Enter  Smatter  Smat  Sir  Gilb  I think  Smatter  you are well furnish'd as to Assurance  Smat  Yes Sir pretty well  Gilb  Manage it properly and it may be of immediate Service Do you think you can make a tolerable Shift to personate me  Smat  You Sir  Gilb  Yes Sir mememyself  Smat  Which Self do you mean Sir Your mad Self or your tame Self That is am I to represent the gay Mr  Gilbert  of  St John's College  or the discreet Mr  Heartly  of  London  Gilb  Sirrah you are to be Mr  Gilbert  of  Oxford  As to the Gaiety or Sobriety of your Behaviour that you must vary as Occasion shall require  Smat  Sir I'll undertake it if I'm properly supply'd  Gilb  Oh you shall have a Suit of Cloaths of mine  Smat  Nothing else Sir  Gilb  O yes every Thing suitable  Smat  I shall never come through Sir if my Pockets are empty You know Sir I am not of a mercenary Disposition But as I am to be your Representative I wou'd for your Sake be as like you as possible in every Particular  Gilb  Well Sir you shall be supply'd with Cash too While I write a Letter do you get yourself ready and then I'll give you further Instructions  Exeunt  SCENE  Celia's  Chamber  AIR VI  At setting Day and rising Morn  CELIA  O hear me Nymph sweet Liberty  On thy gay Mount receive me  O take me hence to dwell with thee  And Birdlike Freedom give me  May Love and Competence attend  And

IntrusionPray Sir will you inform me where I can meet Mr  Trapwell  of  Oxford  I have some particular Business with him and was told I shou'd see or at least here of him here  Lock  Sir he is set out

suppose Prudence always attends Poverty why should you wonder that I am frail when you have prov'd yourself so What is there more amazing at my being smitten with the Man at first Sight than your immediately conceiving a Passion for the Master  Celia  Why I must own the whole of the Adventure savours rather more of the Romantic than the Prudent but if the Catastrope is crown'd with Success no Matter for the Time or Manner of its Commencement  AIR VIII  The heavy Hours  Say Nymphs whose gentle Bosoms prove  The pleasing painful Dart  Cou'd Prudence e'er contend with Love  Or heal the

Beginning of your Conversation I am convinc'd the Match cannot be disagreeable to you And for my Part I am so well pleas'd to find my Daughter has been led by Chance to the Person my coolest Judgment wou'd have chosen that I shall bury in Oblivion all Thoughts of the Intent and make myself happy by reflecting on the pleasing Consequence  Celia  Sir I knew some Time before this Affair came to a Crisis this was the Gentleman you intended for me but some Circumstances that attended our first Converse made an Explanation wholly improper Depend on't Sir though I might not have implicitly obey'd

has turn'd out so much to the Satisfaction of all Parties And Sir  to young Gilbert  All I ask of you as a Reward for my trifling Services is that Spousy and I may remain as followers of your good Fortunes and be daily Witnesses of the Happiness we have endeavour'd to promote  Gilb Smatter  I am bound to you and shall have a Pleasure in making the Return you wish Now my dear  Celia  our

Peace bestow  Her Love confirm me blest  Celia  My Soul's by Love and you subdu'd  Again my Faith I plight  May nought like Contest e'er intrude  But who shall most delight  Both sing the last Verse
