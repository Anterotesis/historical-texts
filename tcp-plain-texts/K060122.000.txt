 AN ESSAY UPON  Publick Credit  c  AN ESSAY UPON Publick Credit  BEING An ENQUIRY How the PUBLICK CREDIT comes to depend upon the Change of the  Ministry  or the Dissolutions of  Parliaments  and whether it does so or no  With an ARGUMENT Proving that the PUBLICK CREDIT may be upheld and maintain'd in this Nation and perhaps brought to a greater Height than it ever yet arriv'd at Tho' all the Changes or Dissolutions already Made Pretended to and now Discours'd of shou'd come to pass in the World  LONDON  Printed and Sold by the Booksellers MDCCX Price  Three Pence  AN ESSAY UPON  Publick Credit  c  THE World being so full of Polititians and so many Authors having of late turn'd Statesmen it behoves me to lay every Thing down exceeding plain as I go on The Subject is nice the Age abusive the Town full of  Observers  and  Reviewers  who Write to please and content the Notions of Men who directed by their Interest and Parties differ even with themselves Reason it is true is DICTATOR in the Society of Mankind from her there ought to lye no Appeal But here we want a Pope in our Philosophy to be the infallible Judge of what  is  or  is not  Reason  I am to speak of what all People are busie about but not one in Forty understands Every Man has a Concern in it few know what it is nor is it easy to define or describe it If a Man goes about to explain it by Words he rather struggles to lose himself  in the Wood  than bring others out of it It is best describ'd by it self 'tis like the Wind that blows  where it lists  we hear the  sound  thereof but hardly know  whence it comes  or  whither it goes  Like the Soul  in the Body it acts all Substance yet is it self Immaterial it gives Motion yet it self cannot be said to Exist it creates  Forms  yet has it self  no Form  it is neither Quantity or Quality it has no  Whereness  or  Whenness Scite  or  Habit  If I should say it is the essential Shadow of something that is Not should I not Puzzle the thing rather than Explain it and leave you and my self more the Dark than we were before  To come a at direct and clear Understanding of the Thing the best Method will be to describe its  Operations  rather than define its  Nature  to show  how it Acts  rather than  how it Exists  and  what it does  rather than  what it is  TRADE as the Author of the  Review  has told us and who I can better submit to learn of on that subject than  some other he talks more about  "was derived by Convenience from the profitable exchanging of Goods from Nation to Nation and from Place to Place as People encreasing found their Neighbours possest of what they wanted and themselves having to spare of what their Neighbouring Countries did not produce"  This we now call Barter  and is not so much in Use as it was in the Infancy of Commerce in the World  The  Brittains  Inhabiting this Island were found to Exchange their  Block Tin  with the  Phenecian  Merchants for  Spices Wines  and  Oyls  even long before  Julius Caesar  set his Foot upon this Island  But as Trade increased two Accidents  fell in  as Effects being the great  Mediums  of Universal Commerce  the Vehicle  in which Trade is Preserv'd or Administred thro' the World these were  Money  and  Credit  This thing call'd Commerce flourishing and extending every way into all the Corners of the World the Nations falling generally into Dealing with one another yet Trade found it self unsufferably streightned and perplext for want of a General  Species  of a compleat intrinsick Worth  as the Medium  to supply the defect of Exchanging and to make good  the Balanceâ–ª  where a Nation or a Market  or a Merchant demanded of another a greater quantity of Goods than either the Buyer had Goods  to Answer  or the Seller had occasion to  take back  This nothing could be found in the World of universal and intrinsick Worth enough to Answer but  Metals  as being neither consuming in  Quality  bulky in  Carriage  or useless in  Nature  Of these Metals several Nations adhered a long time to such as their own Country produced but  Gold  and  Silver  by their meer intrinsick Worth prevailed and they alone retain the universal Character as it may be called in all Payments of whatever kind in the World  The Course of Trade being thus turned from exchanging of Goods for Goods or  Delivering  and  Taking  to  Selling  and  Paying  all the Bargains in the World are now stated upon the Foot of  a Price  in Money and tho' it be at any Time an Exchange of  Goods  for  Goods  yet even those Goods are on either side rated at a  Price  in Money  Tho' this was a great Assistant to Trade and gave a liberty to the increase of Commerce more than ever it had before  yet  such was the great increase of Trade that it even overrun the Money it self and all the Specie in the World could not answer the Demand or be ready just at  Time Trade called for it  This occasioned  That when  A  Bought more Goods of  B  than  A  had Money to pay for and  B  having no Need of any Goods that  A  had to Sell it behoved that  A  should leave his Goods with  B  for a certain Time in which  A  was to provide the Money for the said Goods And this was done both from the Occasion  B  had to sell his Goods the Occasion  A  had to buy them and the Opinion  B  had of  A  's Integrity and Ability for Payment  And this is the Great Thing call'd CREDIT  CREDIT is a Consequence not a Cause the Effect of a Substance not a Substance 'tis the  Sunshine  not the Sun the quickning SOMETHING  Call it what you will  that gives Life to  Trade  gives Being to the Branches and Moisture to the Root 'tis the  Oil  of the Wheel the  Marrow  in the Bones the  Blood  in the Veins and the  Spirits  in the Heart of all the Negoce Trade Cash and Commerce in the World  It is produc'd and grows insensibly from fair and upright Dealing punctual Compliance honourable Performance of Contracts and Covenants in short 'tis the Offspring of universal Probity  'Tis apparent even by its Nature 'tis no way dependent upon Persons Parliaments or any particular Men or Sett of Men  as such  in the World but upon  their Conduct  and  Just  Behaviour  Credit  never was chain'd to Mens  Names  but to their  Actions  not to Families Clans or Collections of Men no not to Nations 'Tis the Honour the Justice the FairDealing and the equal Conduct of  Men  Bodies of Men Nations and People that raise the thing call'd  Credit  among them wheresoever this is found CREDIT will live and thrive grow and encrease  where this is wanting  let all the Power and Wit of Man join together they can neither give her Being or preserve her Life  Arts have been try'd on various Occasions in the World to raise CREDIT  Art  has been found able with more Ease to destroy  Credit  than to raise it The Force of  Art  assisted by the punctual fair and just Dealing  abovesaid  may have done much to form a  Credit  upon the Face of Things but we find still the  Honour  would have done it without the  Art  but never the  Art  without the  Honour  Nor will Money it self which  Solomon  says  answers all things  purchase this thing call'd  Credit  or restore it when lost  It is in vain to talk of  Credit  without this  Probity  Honesty will raise  Credit  without Money but all the Money in the World will not raise  Credit  without the Principle  D  was a Prince of high Birth a great Character for Wit Gallantry and all the Perfections of a Duke and Peer of one of the Politest Nations in  Europe  he had  besides  a noble Fortune built great Edifices purchased great Houses maintain'd a vast Equipage and did every thing with the Air of an exquisite and most accomplish'd Gentleman he had a vast Fortune great Offices at Court nor did he ever want Money his Stewards were never without Pistols in Cash if  any Summ  however great was wanting to support any Point of Honour for his Play or to purchase what he had his Eye upon he knew how to produce it yet the Barber would not trust him for a Perriwig the Coachmaker would not let his Chariot go home with a new Sett of Wheels  What was the matter  He would pay no Body generously or honourably he would be surrounded with Duns as he came out of his Palace and would go  Incognito  to Court to prevent being insulted The  Sbirri  or  Provost's Men  at  Paris  would stop his Coach in the Street he has been forc'd to  call a Chair and leave his Coach and Horses in their Possession  The thing was plain he had no  Credit  his great Estate his high Birth and Quality his Equipage his vast Quantity of Gold Plate his large Cash they would not add one Inch to the Stature of his  Credit  but he liv'd as if he was Poor and was less esteem'd in the Shops of the Marchands than a private Gentleman nay than one of the  Burgois  I had almost said than a Shoemaker in the City  On the other hand  S  is a Gentleman of a moderate Fortune compar'd to the other but is also a Man of Quality he lives Nobly tho' Frugally keeps a good Equipage a handsom Family does not lay up much his generous Nature will not permit it but he pays punctually no Man comes twice for his Money if a Tradesman leaves his Bill he buys no more of him till he comes for his Money he never Dines till his Wine is paid for he wears no Cloaths that the Taylor or Mercer can reproach him for and call THEIRS as he goes along the Street instead of having his Door crowded with Duns and his Steward brib'd to pay he is rather crowded with Shopkeepers to petition for his Custom his Servants are teiz'd to procure their Lord  to buy here or there and every one studies to leave his Goods for Approbation The Tradesmen are ready to fight who shall get in his Goods and Sell often to Loss to underrate one another What's the Matter  Credit  stands at his Door Honour lives there and  Credit  is her Handmaid The Count deals justly pays punctually every Man's Demands are answer'd  Credit  courts him he shall have her Favour whether he will use her or no  It is needless to enlarge Experience tells us the same thing in all Cases whether private or publick Personal or National  Credit  is the Consequence of just and honourable Dealing fair Proposals punctually perform'd will bring Credit let the Person or People be who they will How do we Trade among the  Turks  and Trust the  Mahometans  one of whose Doctrines in the  Alchor an  is not to keep Faith with Christians They have obtain'd it by a just punctual and honourable Practice  in Trade  and you  Credit them without Scruple  nay rather than a Christian  Upon this Foundation I build what I am in hand with and bring it down to the present Case I know no Persons or Parties in my Argument This Lord  Treasurer or another Lord Treasurer or no Lord Treasurer it is the same thing to me a Bank or no Bank 'tis all one I'll sell none of my Tallies or Annuities I'll discount no Exchequer Bills Dissolve the Parliament or not Dissolve the Parliament 'tis all one to me I neither fear desire or am anxious about either nor can I see so much Cause for an Alarm among our People that have Money as if Credit was pinn'd to the Girdle of a Man or waited at the Door of the House of Commons the thing is a Mistake Credit attends the honourable Management of your  Treasurers  your  Exchequers  your  Parliaments  whether past present or to come  I do not examine what Politic Reasons may induce her Majesty to change or remove her Great Men in the Ministry I enquire not whether her Majesty purposes to dissolve the Parliament or to let them Sir these things are not concern'd in our Case The late Lord Treasurer I allow has done Honourably has manag'd the Finances with great and unusual Dexterity and has acquir'd thereby the Fame of the Best Officer that has for many Years acted in that Post I could be content to spend a whole Page in his Praise the Nation is infinitely obliged to him and his Royal Mistress no  doubt has receiv'd infinite Satisfaction in his Conduct as appears by rejecting all Attempts against him and keeping him so long in a Post of so Great Trust  But after this is said  Credit  which has for some Years been the Nations happy Guest by whose Aid such mighty Things have been done cannot be said to be the sole Property of my Lord Tr Personally it is not singly intail'd upon his Family or his Name this would be to go a length his Lordship himself has more Modesty than to claim no would his Lordship be well pleased with any that could think such course kind of Flattery would oblige him  Our Credit in this Case is a Public Thing it is rightly call'd by some of our Writers NATIONAL CREDIT the Word denominates its Original 'tis produc'd by  the Nations  Probity the Honour and exact performing  National Engagements  In this the Great Officers of the Treasury and Exchequer are as we may say perfectly Passive their Business is indeed Active so the Wheels of a Clock their Business is to go round but they are subject to the Influence of  their Position  the Operations of the Springs and Wheels that guide  their Motion  by which they act passively if that may be said  that is  of meer Necessity and the punctual  pointing of the Hand to the Lines shewing the Hour the Minutes and the Seconds  are Consequences  of these Motions These indeed tell us that the Wheels are good perfectly made exactly plac'd and move to a Truth but the Honour redounds to the  Workman  who plac'd them in that exact Order adapted them to their several Uses and placed such Springs and Wheels about them which by their like exactness but all deriv'd from the same Original oblige every part punctually to perform the End of the whole Movement  CREDIT is not the Effect of this or that Wheel in the Government moving regular and just to its proper Work but of the whole Movement acting by the Force of its true original Motion according to the exquisite Design of the Director of the whole Frame  Thus the  Honour  the  Probity  the  exact  punctual  Management  which has raised our  Credit  to the pitch it is now arriv'd at has not been merely the Great Wheel in  the Nations Clockwork  that turn'd about the Treasure but the Great Spring that turn'd about that Wheel and this is the QUEEN and PARLIAMENT  The one  the Spring  still keeping to the Allegory  that gives Motion or Life to the whole  the other  the Balance or Pendulum  that regulates that Motion keeps it true to and exact in the performance of the General Work  viz  the equal and punctual dividing the smallest measures of Time  This Nice Case  requires me a little to descend to Particulars and touch Matter of Fact nearer than was intended What is it has restored and recovered the Nations  Credit  from the Breaches made in it The answering this necessarily requires that I should also ask what made the former Breaches in  our Credit  I shall do this as Modestly as I can for it is not the present Work to open Sores but to heal them to prevent more from breaking out  Some of the Reasons which sunk  our Credit  and made the Breaches in it in the late Reign were the settling Funds that were in themselves deficient and making no Provinsion to supply those Deficiencies Some would perhaps go farther and say It was settling Funds that  were not probable  and whose Deficiencies Were visible I shall not go that length the Error was in the Original it would be unjust to charge the Deficiency of these Funds upon the Commissioners of the Treasury  for the Time being  it would be still harder to blame them for the Parliament  not supplying those Deficiencies Some may have said they were to blame in the First Act because it was their Work to provide Funds and the Parliament only gave what they ask'd that they took them and went away satisfied as sufficient for the supply of the Occasion and that they were Judges of the probability  I am not of that mind  tho' it is not to my purpose here to debate it But this is Certain the not supplying the Deficiencies upon the repeated Application of the Persons whose Estates lay in those Deficiencies seem'd wholly to lye at the Door of the Parliament and this brought the Tallies on those Funds to intollerable unheard of Discounts to the ruin of all that we  called Credit  What then has raised  this Credit  I hope I do not detract from the just Character of him whom one calls the great Guide of the Nation's Treasure if I say It was something else than his Lordship's Management something Prior to it  in which  that National Honour and Justice Resolution of punctual Payment and Concern for the Means of it  appeared  which put Life into the Nation and made those People that had Money think it  as safe  as well deposited and the Principal in as  good Hands  as in their own so that they  were perfectly Easie in adventuring their Money and the longer this went on the forwarder were the People to bring in their Money Nay so forward that the faster the Government lower'd their Interest the more eager were the People to bring in their Money  Let us see  where this began and this will tell us  whose doing  it was After the first Session of Parliament of Her present Majesty the Queen acquainted the House That the Funds had more than answered the Sums  they were given for  there was the capital Wound of Deficiency healed at once That the Overplus should be apply'd c There was an Assurance that all Deficiencies if any happen'd should be made good This gave  the Parliament Part  a Brightness that reviv'd the Spirits of the People help'd open their Purses which had been so long closed and caused Taxes to be raised without murmuring  The Queen  acted the next part Her Majesty gave constant Assurances that every thing given should be  rightly apply'd  and to Encourage her People and shew she was willing  to bear a part  of their Burthen the Queen generously threw in  an Hundred thousand Pownd  of her own Money  appropriated for the Civil List  to ease  the Nation of so much in that Years Burthen  These were Steps  no Prince ever was known to take before  After this  you never heard of a Complaint of the heavy Burthen of the Taxes tho' greater far than any raised in the former Reign on the contrary  the more  you rais'd  the easier  they were paid  the more  the Nation ran in Debt  the higher  their Credit rose every day  After this  you never had any Commissioners of Accounts ask'd for or any Question about Misapplication  No Man  need go far for a Reason for this  the Credit  centred all in the Queen whose Concern was so visible for her Peoples good that she would suffer no Misapplications that she would Employ none but in whom she could place entire Confidence whose Probity and Exactness her Majesty could answer for  to her self  and was well assured she might be  safe in  'Tis no way lessening the Honour of the Servants her Majesty Chose to say that the Nations Credit depends not on the Reputation of their Conduct but on her Majesty's Care in Chosing such Men whose Conduct would perform all the Nation could expect and that if they should fail her Majesty would not fail to remove them and put in others This is putting the thing right the Sum and  Substance of the Argument is this in short  Publick Credit  is the Consequence of honourable just and punctual Management in the Matter of  Funds  and  Taxes  or Loans upon them Where this goes before Credit always follows  This Management  depends not upon the WellExecuting their Offices by the great Officers of the Treasury and the Exchequer but on the  Care Conduct  and  Vigilance  of her Majesty and the Parliament  the latter  in Establishing sufficient Funds and  the former  in Placing able Officers and obliging them to an honourable Management  The  Publick Credit  therefore depends upon the Queen and Parliament entirely and not at all upon the well or ill Management of the Officers of what kind soever  Another thing confirms this  viz  That while the Parliament Concerns it self to prevent the Deficiency of Funds and the Queen to Place Men of Probity and Honour in the Government of her Treasury  there is no Question to be made  but both would concern themselves  upon any Complaints of the Subject  to enquire into any Mismanagement or Abuse of the People in the greatest Officers and not only punish the Offender but  prevent the  Offence  by removing such Officer and supplying his Place with others who should better discharge so weighty a Trust This resolves the Point That Credit centers where the Government centers for if the Sovereign displaces those that misapply the Wound to Credit heals of it self and while the Sovereign carefully prefers Men of Honour and Probity in the Nations Trust Credit rises by a natural Consequence  But still it is the NATIONS CREDIT  that is  it is built on the Honour of the Queen and Parliament as above and this has been the Case of the late Lord Treasurer the Credit of whose Management must return to the Queen as to the Center otherwise this must be call'd  My Lord T 's Credit  not the  Nations  and to our great loss must dye with his Lordship which would be very unhappy  for us  and would imply that we ought to be more concern'd for his Lordship's long Life than the Queen's a thing would very ill please even his Lordship to suggest  Having laid down this as a Foundation I build this short Fabrick upon it  viz That as  the Publick Credit is  National  not  Personal  so it depends upon No  thing  or  Person  No  Man  or  Body of  Men  but upon the Government  that is  The Queen and Parliament displacing or removing any Minister of State or great Officer whose Management under the Sovereign affects our Treasure can no way influence our  National Credit  while the Just Honourable and Punctual Conduct of the Sovereign and Parliament remains the same Neither does our Credit depend upon the Person of the Queen  as Queen  or the individual House of Commons  Identically  as if  no Queen  but her present Majesty and  no Parliament  but the present Parliament could support and uphold the Credit of the Nation  But  it will remain a Truth that  every Queen  or  every King  and  every Parliament  succeeding the Present that shall discover the  same Justice  in Government the  same Care  in giving sufficient Funds the  same Honesty  in supplying the Deficiencies if they happen  the same  Concern for the Burthen of the Subject and  the same  Care to put the Treasure into the Hands of Faithful and Experienc'd Officers shall keep up  the same  Character have  the same  Credit and restore all these Declinings to  the same  Vigour and Magnitude as ever  From hence it appears  That our present Loss of  Credit  does not arise from any Doubt whether the like Conduct can produce this Effect or no but from a strange Suggestion That a new Parliament or a new Ministry shall either  not Design  or not  Pursue  the same vigorous and wise Resolutions or mannage with  the same  Integrity as the last have done If her Majesty saw room sor this Suggestion I make no doubt her Concern for the Publick Good  is such  that no such Change had been made or would lodge an Hour longer among her Thoughts but if her Majesty is of the Opinion that such a Change will not lessen the Concern  for  or just Measures  in  the Publick Service then the Difficulty ends Her Majesty has now put new Officers into her Treasury No doubt her Majesty  is satisfied  it shall be in their Power to preserve the  Publick Credit  and restore it to as great a height as ever it was before And I will presume to add That if her Majesty should find it otherwise it wouldbe an effectual Motive to  farther Changes  till such Hands should be found in whose Conduct the  National Credit  could not Miscarry  It seems that the present Discontents are grounded upon  a Supposition  That a New Ministry shall be less zealous for  the Publick Interest than the present or at least the Objectors argue that her Majesty has sufficient Experience of the Zeal of the present Ministry  for her Service  and for the Public Good and therefore it cannot seem rational to run that Risque and the like of a New Parliament  To this may be answer'd Why should it be suggested that a New Parliament shall not be equally zealous for the Liberties of  Britain  with the present They are to be chosen by the Freeholders they are to be Englishmen they are to be Protestants they are to abjure the Pretender they are to be join'd with  the same  House of Lords to be blessed with  the same  Queen and the Queen I doubt not fill'd with  the same  Principles as before  the same  by which her Majesty for I must place it there  restor'd the Nations Credit before  and raised it to what we have now seen it  Shall we say The Parliament will not raise Money to carry on the War This would be to say We shall choose such a Parliament as will  declare the Pretender forsake  the Confederacy  join  with the Common Enemy and  Depose  the Queen These are Fears no thinking Man can suppose to be rational and are spread about  by none  but those  that desire it should be so and who crying out loudest of the Fall of  Public Credit  procure the thing they complain of and indeed we have no Breach of  our Credit  but what rises from these Men  To back their Fears and make others think them reasonable they give long Accounts of the Progress of Dr  Sacheverell  as if the Folly and Impolitick Vanity of that Gentleman could influence the People of  England  to send up Men as  mad  and  foolish  as himself I must profess to think if Dr  Sacheverell  thinks he serves the Interest he pretends to appear for by his mobbing and riotous Progress he is as much mistaken  as they were  who made him Popular by a hasty Prosecution instead of committing his Sermon to the HangMan and kicking him from the Bar for a Lunatic which if they had done the Nation had been more in Debt to  their Prudence  than I think they are now for  their Justice  I am against Furies on both sides nor do I see any such coming in If her Majesty does let in any such  I dare presume to say  it must be for want of having their due Character and the Term of their Services may probably end when they discover themselves  But if Men of Moderation and Men of Integrity come in I see no room to fear but  our Credit  shall revive as well under a New Ministry as an Old  I know  that some talk of a Stagnation of the Fountain that there is a Famine of Funds that the Nation is exhausted and we are at a full Stop This I take to be  an Amusement  that comes over from  France  and is calculated very much for the Service of the Enemy But there are ways to get over the Difficulty and the best way is Demonstration and Experience I believe the  French  King does not raise half so much Hopes from our not being able to find any Funds at all as from our being at a loss for Credit to borrow upon those Funds when they are raised and he may live to be deceived in both  But to obviate these things  I take the liberty to say  and that not withoutbook When the Parliament meets be it the present Parliament or a new Parliament be it the present Ministry or a new Ministry as I hope there will not want Zeal in the Members to supply her Majesty's Occasions for the War so were this War to hold Seven Years longer it is easy to propose sufficient Funds for the carrying it on without that horrid Proposal of mortgaging our  LandTax  or without  any  such Taxes  as shall either be burthensom to the Poor or scandalous to the Nation  As to Credit  while the Parliament and the Queen continue to preserve those Funds from Deficiencies to make good such as happen and to support the Vigour and Honour of the Publick Management I see no room to doubt but  Credit  shall revive and as we have not yet found any Fund the Parliament has rais'd unsupply'd with Loans and Advances upon it even faster than could be desired so I can see no room to fear the contrary Yet if such a Thing should happen a mean Head may find out some Expedient that may not be ineffectual for a Supply of which if there should be Occasion a Proposal shall not be wanting  FINIS
