 KNAVE OR NOT A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL DRURYLANE  BY  THOMAS HOLCROFT  SECOND EDITION  LONDON  PRINTED FOR G G AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW  MDCCXCVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE unrelenting opposition which the productions of the author of the present comedy have experienced for several years is well known to those who pay attention to our public amusements It is not for him to pronounce how far this opposition has been merited by inability Since the appearance of The Road to Ruin his comedy of The Deserted Daughter only has escaped and that as he imagines because it was not known on the night of its first performance by whom it was written Love's Frailties The Man of Ten Thousand and Knave or Not have sustained increasing marks of hostility so that the efforts made to afford rational amusement to the public emolument to the author and improvement to morals have been rendered feeble and almost ineffectual In the last instance one mistake appears to have pervaded the majority of the spectators It was imagined that the author himself was as unqualified a libeller of mankind as Monrose in which character the writer's individual sentiments were supposed to have been incorporated Those who have read his other works surely cannot attribute to him any such indiscriminate misanthropy The accusation that has most generally been made against him is that he thinks men capable of gradations of virtue which others affirm they can never attain Persons who have made the human mind their study have discovered that guilty men exert the whole force of their faculties to justify their own course of action to themselves To this principle the writer was strictly attentive in pourtraying the character of Monrose His design was to draw a man of genius misled by his passions reasoning on his actions systematizing them condemning them in principle but justifying them in practice and heating his imagination by contemplating the crimes of others that he might still maintain that respect for himself of which the strongest minds even in the last stages of vice are so tenacious How far that spirit of faction commotion and anarchy of which the author has long been and is still so vehemently accused is to be traced in the present comedy may now be seen Sincerely desirous of giving no offence the passages which were most disapproved or to speak more accurately reprobated on the first night have since been omitted in representation but they are printed between inverted  commas that the cool judgment may decide whether the author could have been so insane as actually to intend to enflame the spectators and increase a spirit of enmity between men of different sentiments whom could he reconcile he would account it the most beneficial and heart consoling action of his life The seventh scene in the fourth act is likewise omitted in the performance because instead of giving pleasure it appeared tedious It is inserted here rather to preserve a necessary connection between the scenes than to appeal from the judgment and the feelings of a whole audience  Before the comedy appeared all parties were anxious that no sentence or word should be spoken which could be liable to misrepresentation Some few passages therefore are committed to the press which never were spoken on the Stage particularly the concluding part of the last speech in the second act where Monrose enquires into his qualifications for being a lord A few years ago this would have been commonplace satire and it is a subject of no little regret that at present local and temporary applications are so liable to be made where none are intended  Truth requires it should be mentioned that in the original sketch of this comedy some hints were taken from IL RAGGIRATORE LA SERVA AMOROSA and IL PADRE DI FAMIGLIA by GOLDONI but of these though he has not lately examined them the author is persuaded so few traces remain that they are scarcely discoverable They are mentioned because he considers the least concealment of such a kind as derogatory to that veracity which it is the peculiar duty of moral writers to inculcate  February  PROLOGUE  AMONG the various ways by wit devis'd  To paint our faults and follies undisguis'd  Through every age is found of most avail  The well drawn character and well told tale  Hence has the Stage become the last resort  Of injured Innocence her proper court  "The guilty wretch" whom power and gold can screen  "Struck to the soul" will sicken at the scene  Vice that with front erect and brazen eye  In broad day pomp will pass unblushing by  Should he be seen but "sitting at a play"  How will his secret sins that conscious eye betray  Pert Folly too caprice in every freak  Displays her feather'd head and painted cheek  While "louder far than Wisdom in the street"  She cries"Lo Here am I Come worship at my feet"  The thoughtless crowd thus summon'd to adore her  Hear stare obey and prostrate fall before her  Yet let her be in all her frippery caught  Just as she shews herself and hither brought  The moment here she's seen the witless elves  Laugh at their goddess and despisethemselves  Fantastic changeling Catch her Ay But how  Th' attempt is bending great Ulysses' bow  And yet again we come with random darts  Now aiming at your heads now at your hearts  But all in mirth and with no ill intent  At Vice and Folly our few shafts are sent  We shoot but o'er the house or in the dark  Hoping that you'll be pleas'd whene'er we hit the mark  EPILOGUE  BY M G LEWIS ESQ M P AUTHOR OF THE MONK THE CASTLE SPECTRE C  I AM angryQuite angryThe whole of this night  I've been ready to burst with vexation and spite  And now am come hither in haste to disclose  Why grief swells my bosom and reddens my nose  In hopes a new road to your favour to find  The mask of Thalia I lately resigned  And undaunted by prejudice fashion or scandal  Melpomene's dagger I ventured to handle  My heroic exertions the truth to confess  By the Public's indulgence were crowned with success  For when with distraction my bosom was seized  I'm sure you all seemed to be mightily pleased  When my poniard I drew you applauded the action  And whenever I murdered showed great satisfaction  Then is it not hard that our Author tonight  Should have dragged me at once from my tragical height▪  My Bristolstone dagger away has he ta'en  He has cut off four yards of my white satin train  And presumptuously begs for the rest of the season  That I'd try to amuse you with nature and reason  This prayer I protested I never could grant  I had ranted and raved and would still rave and rant  And I told him this part which for me he had planned  Was not half enough furious terrific or grand  I see not one Ghost through the whole of the part  Cannot once find a place for a Tragedy start  My bosom I beat not my locks must not rend  Nor murder one man from beginning to end  My displeasure and anger resolved to display  I called at the door of our Author one day  Was admittedsat downcleared my voicefurled my fan  Put my critical face on and gravely began  Says I"Mr Thingummy plainly to speak  "Your hold on the public opinion is weak  "For your canvas presents neither Daemons nor Witches▪  "And your Villains appear in coat waistcoat and breeches  "Now let me advise you your subject to change  "For something that's showy terrific and strange  "That his Play must succeed may the Bard safely boast  "Who opens the piece with a Song by a Ghost  "But in popular plaudits unbounded he revels  "If he follows the Song with a Dance by two Devils  "Observe too you'll greatly increase the effect  "If your colours with caution and taste you select  "Thus to make on the feelings a serious attack  "Let your Spectres be white and your Servants be black  "And to finish the whole with a striking new Scene  "Let a Pompadour Prince wed a Coquelicot Queen  "Give us Lightning and Thunder Flames Daggers and Rage  "With events that ne'er happened except on the Stage  "When your Spectre departs through a trapdoor ingulph her  "Burn under her nose too some brimstone and sulphur  "Let Magicians and Monsters be poured on our view  "And stick on your Villains a beard of pale blue  Alluding to the Romance of BlueBeard  "  My remonstrance was vainHe asserts you can be  Wellpleased when goodsense mirth and nature you see  Though his Play should not leave you half dead with affright  And I heartily pray that the man may be right  As for me though I'm sorry my part won't permit  Me to squall at a Spectre and frighten the Pit  I hope you'll allow this performance has merit  And though without Ghost think 'tis not without spirit  Which Spirit on Monday escaping from Styx  Will appear in this placeat a quarter past six
