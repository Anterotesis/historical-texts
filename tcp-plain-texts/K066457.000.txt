say 'twill be an Amusement to the Town and a Satisfaction to their Curiosity to collect all the Papers the late theatrical Squabbles have produc'd and you desire my Leave to print themyou have it with all my Heart You desire I would not take it ill that you publish among the rest that thing call'd a Letter from antient  Pistol  to young  Pistol  I think I can't better shew my Contempt of it than by desiring you not to omit itWere you Printing a Trialto sink any Evidence or Pleadings on either Side the Question tho' ever so false so ridiculous or impertinent were an unfair Treatment of the Publick If I knew the incomprehensible Author of that extraordinary Piece I should desire no other FLING at him but to  affix his Name at Length to his elaborate Work  Who it is I neither know nor care nor am I anxious to be satisfied whether a certain Person guess'd by many was really the Author or no I mean one who for his ill Manners in disturbing a social Company was not long since  "  quoited down Stairs like a Shuffleboard Piece  Tho' I am sensible many Means have been us'd to depreciate me both as a Man and an Actor in the Minds of People here I can but smile at such impotent Malice and shall ever with grateful Joy remember the Gentlemen of this Kingdom to their Honour be it said would not suffer themselves to be misguided by Pique or Prejudice no they would judge for themselvesLet my Enemies call this boasting if they please I had rather run the Hazard of that Censure than be liable to the Imputation of Ingratitude and  sure  to be totally silent on this Occasion were to be unworthy of their Favours I have not Words equal to my Sentiments of my Obligations to the Town let me therefore  ntreat their Candour their Humanity and better Sense to supply my Deficiency and think what ought to be said when I would declare how much and how sincerely  I am their most obliged most obedient and devoted very humble Servant THEOPHILUS CIBBER  P S  I hope you'll not omit in your Collection that choice Copy of Verses address'd to Mr  Sheridan  printed in  Reily  's  NewsLetter Tuesday August    The following Paragraphs are extracted from THE THEATRE N  o  a Paper publish'd in  London  twice a Week by Sir  Richard Steele  under the Name of Sir  John Edgar  in the Year  LET any Man who understands Conversation or Business that lives amongst knowing Men either in Publick or private Life consider the Diflidence we are usually under in executing any  Part that naturally is our Duty and requires only acting in Publick what is demanded of us in our ordinary Characters and Functions I say let any one reflect on this and he will account for the Concern and Confusion in which an Actor must behold an Auditor stir up any new Reflection or Thought in his old Adversaries the Vulgar the Unthinking and the Boisterous who have it in their Power by Noise or Clamour while he is to perform what is foreign to himself to disconcert and push him out of a personated Character of Liveliness and Mirth into his private one of Grief and Dejection And yet perhaps in two Minutes it shall be expected that he shall be enough himself to assume the Person whom even to please his Oppressors he is still oblig'd to represent This Consideration is enough to gain him the Favour and Protection of reasonable Men tho' perhaps it may require Time to turn the Edge of Youths of false Fire natural Wickedness and warm Blood so far as to look in upon themselves and see how much they have wanted and ought to learn Humanity  The Humour in which People go to Plays is generally that of Leisure and Indolence and the Entertainment gives them such a Notion of Levity and Chearfulness in the Performers that they have not the same Idea of their laborious Life as they have of the Application of other useful People whose Business does not require half the Sense and Diligence to be Masters of it They do not consider that Readiness Alacrity Spirit and Disengagement from themselves are in no one Station of Life so indispensably necessary as in the Duty of an accomplish'd Actor And if all these uncommon Qualities are not summon'd and about him at a certain Hour his Interest and Reputation are lost at once For he cannot even subsist without being always in a Readiness to place himself in his best Appearance Painful the Task and incumbent only on the undervalu'd Player  These were Publish'd  July  th  To Mr GEORGE FAULKNER  Trinity College Dublin  July th  Sir  IN addressing you we are sensible we speak to the Publick and we are but too well acquainted with the Deference owing to their Judgment not to be desirous of their Approbation with Submission therefore to all those whose Censure may deserve our Regard we presume it will not be taken amiss that we are resolved to see Justice done to injured Merit  Upon a strict and impartial Enquiry into the  Reasons  of Mr  Sheridan  's not appearing  Thursday  last in the Character of  Cato  we find them so strong and  satisfactory  that our Resolution we hope will be favourably look'd on of seeing him righted and the Insolence of others properly chastised who either thro' Envy or Malice wou'd remove the strongest Inducement we have for frequenting the Playhouse and consequently deprive us of the Satisfaction we propose to ourselves from the most rational Amusements and it's expected none will condemn us for frustrating the malicious Contrivances of some sew designing Wretches and by so doing convince them their envious but shallow Practices shall always prove abortive whenever they tend to wrong or depress real Merit  An Apology of this Nature we could not but judge absolutely necessary to prevent any Misconstructions we might possibly expose ourselves to by our Resentment to find one of the principal Characters burlesqed by the Presumption of one every way unequal to it  To Mr SHERIDAN  TrinityCollege  July  SIR  THE Reasons you assign for not performing the Part of  Cato  last  Thursday  are more than sufficient to justify you in the Opinion of every unprejudiced Person and tho' your Resentment of the Usage you receiv'd is equally just we hope it will not deprive us of the Satisfaction we promise ourselves from so eminent a Genius As the Declarations of some malicious Persons may possibly have  made you apprehensive of being hereafter insulted we take this Opportunity with the greatest Deference to those whose Judgment is to be regarded of publickly assuring you that the just Sense we have of your Merit and the ill Usage you have met with has determined us not only to support you but frustrate any malicious Schemes  Theatrical Politicians  may form to your Disadvantage  These were stuck upon Posts about Town  July  th  CIBBER's Warning Piece  NOW mourn immortal  Shakespear  grieve to hear  Thy tuneful Muse offend each skilful Ear  Now wonder why those bold majestick Strains  The toilsome Task of Years thy rich Remains  Desist to

dance  Othello  By those Gods I swear  Tumultuous Peals of Oranges shall fly  Like Showers of Hail srom an enraged Sky  Therefore we charge you  Ophy Cr  cease  Least we bestow you Birch instead of Bays  To the Ladies and Gentlemen who were Present at the Play of CATO last  Thursday  I Am extreamly concerned for the Occasion of my addressing you in this publick Manner but as the  Disappointment which you met with at my not being able to perform has given rise to several Stories very little in my Favour I think it my Duty to clear up the Matter and justify myself The Fact is thus When I went to the Playhouse I found every thing in great Confusion the People not paid and clamouring for their Money the Musick refusing to play unless their Arrears were discharged and an Account brought at the same Time that Mr  Philips  the Director and Manager of the Whole had absconded As I was dressing for my Part I found the Robe which I had before worn in CATO was wanting upon enquiry I heard that Mr  Philips  had come two Days before and taken it from the House I had some Reason to believe that he had done it purely to prevent my Playing that Night the Resentment I conceived at such Treatment the Concern I was under lest the Audience should be disappointed some other ill Usage I received and several other Incidents concurring a Detail of which would take up too much Time disordered me so much that it not only rendered me incapable of doing Justice to the Character I was to play but like wise almost took away my voice You yourselves were Witnesses of this when I endeavoured to make an Apology and could not be heard And indeed I was in such Confusion that had I been heard I should not have been understood I appeal to any reasonable Person then present whether it were better in these Circumstances to dismiss the House which was my Intention or to keep them purely to convince them that it was not in my Power to get through one Speech of the Part It has been said that the want of a Robe was a trifling Thing and that the Audience would have been content to have received me in any Dress they must have but little Skill in Theatrical Affairs who think a proper Habit is not absolutely neceslary or that a Person can perform a Part well with a Consciousness about him that he looks it ill This was more particularly my Case in this Character as it is one for which I am naturally very unfit in my Person and in which nothing could have made my Appearance supportable but a large Robe to cover my Defects and give a Gravity and Dignity to my  Person which I wanted and which are so absolutely necessary to the Character I know when an Audience is disappointed they often make but little Allowances for the Actor they feel nothing of the Concern and Anxiety of Mind he labours under when he has acquired a Reputation by performing a Character one Night and sees himself about to lose it in another But it was not that nor the ill Treatment I had received which hindered my Playing it was the Effect which all this had on me I had so much Deference for the Audience and so much Gratitude nay it was so much my Duty that I should have sacrificed all Regard to Character and every other Consideration to have done my utmost to have pleased them even in the meanest Dress had I not found that my Voice was quite gone and that it was not in my Power to go through with one Scene I was then reduced to this Difficulty either to detain them when I found I was not only incapable of giving them the Satisfaction they might expect but must have given them the highest Disgust in my Performance or else fairly to tell them that it was not in my Power to play I chose the latter if it was an Error it is one I have paid dearly for since to that Principle I sacrificed above sixty Pounds which I absolutely lost by not playing Such Persons as have assigned any other Cause for my not performing if they can suppose me either vain or ungrateful or even impudent enough to disappoint an Audience meerly out of Whim or Humour I hope will not think me Fool enough to stand to such a Loss  And now tho' I have already trespass'd too much on your Patience I must beg your Indulgence a little farther as I perhaps shall not have another Opportunity of doing it in permitting me to return you and all the Ladies and Gentlemen of this Kingdom who have honoured the Plays in which I performed with their Presence my sincere and hearty Thanks for all your Favours The Success I have met with has been an additional Pleasure to me as by this Means you have convinced the World how false that Opinion is which has prevail'd amongst some that the People of  Ireland  are kinder to Strangers than to their own For your great Indulgence to me is  a manifest Proof how willing you are to encourage the least Dawn of Merit in one of your Country Yet I am sorry to say it your great Favour and the prodigious Success I have met with have I find rais'd me many Enemies there are some People who can not behold the Prosperity of others in any way of Life without Envy and as I am conscious to myself that I have by no Action of mine deserv'd the Hatred of any Person I must believe I have no Enemies but such as my Success has made so That I have some is manifest from the Industry with which some People spread Reports to my Disadvantage and the Readiness with which others believe them My Gratitude to the Publick the Friendship I have experienc'd in Private and the Love I have for my Country would have detained me here much longer if I could in the least have contributed to the Publick Entertainment in spight of any Advantages I could have propros'd to myself in another Kingdom I should be sorry a few Snakes in the Grass should drive me from so fair a Field but it is a Misfortune in our Way of Life that a few malicious People can do a Person more Injury in one Night than the Friendship of the Publick in general can repair  I sincerely wish that the Success I have met with may be a Means of raising up some Genius more worthy to entertain you but this I will venture to say that you will never find any who has studied to do it with more Zeal and Industry or who has a more grateful Sense of the many Obligations you have conferr'd  On your most obliged and devoted humble Servant THOMAS SHERIDAN  July th  An Epistle from Mr THEOPHILUS CIBBER Comedian to Mr THOMAS SHERIDAN Tragedian  It is a Kind of Slander to trust to Rumour  B JOHNSON  Bella horrida Bella  The Scene oft' rallies  ollies of the Age  Laugh in your turn at  ollies of the Stage  ANON  Stephen'sGreen  Tuesday Afternoon July  Mr SHERIDAN  YOUR injudicious Disappointment of the Company last  Thursday  who expected to see you in the Character of CATO and your indiscreet Attempt to dismiss the Audience having as you confess become a Towntalk and given Rise to many idle Falshoods meerly calculated to injure the Innocent You must excuse me if I relate the Fact strictly adhering to Truth There were many Witnesses of what I am about to declare and I know none except yourself whose Memory is weak enough to forget it or will be hardy enough to deny it  When it drew near the Time proper to begin the Play Mr  Giffard  and myself were alarm'd in the Dressingroom with a Report that you declared you would not play because you had not the same Robe you wore in that Character before and that you said The Audience must be dismiss'd This Reason for dismissing an Audience propos'd by you who had no Right to dismiss them appear'd to me so weak I could not believe it till you came into the Room and swore Unless you had that Robe you would not act This Declaration I looked upon as a rash Expression the meer Effect of your then ruf  led Temper but could not yet suppose you would proceed so idly as you did You were then compleatly dress'd from Head to Foot as well as ever the Character was dress'd in any Theatre in  Ireland  or  England  all but the Robe  Upon Enquiry it appeared the Robes worn by  Cato Juba  and  Sempronius  the first Night were borrowed  by  Philips  of some Gentlewoman in this Town who bought them in an Auction at  London  some Time since but were by no Means the Property of the Managers or any one belonging to the Theatre nor were to be got that Night so all the Heroes were equally disappointed of those Trappings Your Impatience increased and tho' another Robe was brought you the same Robe that was made new this Year for Mr  Husband  in the Character of  Julius Caesar  you persisted in having the other uncomeatable Robe or you positively would undress and was determined not to play To every body's Surprize you did undress and in spight of the most friendly Remonstrances to the contrary you made a broken kind of Speech to the Audience with which they were so dissatisfied they could not help shewing it  Before you went on I entreated you on the meer exchange of a Robe not to do so unpolitic a Thing I might add unpolite as to think of disappointing the Town of their Diversion You reply'd The Vexation had deprived you of your Voice and rendered you incapable of performing I desir'd you to consider the first Act was of such a considerable Length you might have Time enough to recover your Temper and your Voice would probably return with it or if the Defect lasted your attempting to perform would appear so obliging the Audience would readily make any Allowances when they knew you had been ruffled  c  but to think of giving them no Play at all was what I could not but conceive would offend them  To repeat all was said to you on this Occasion would add to the Tediousness of this Recital But as near as I can remember nothing was omitted in the most friendly Manner to dissuade you from your mistaken Purpose  I am informed you stay'd afterwards just long enough to hear the extraordinary indulgent Reception the Audience were pleased to bestow on my proposing with their Leave to give them the Play  in the best Manner we could since it was not in our Power to give it them so well as we would  You then ran hastily out of the House and sent a Message afterwards to the Theatre  That you would not by any Means have your Name delivered out for another Play for you would positively act no more  I should not Mr  Sheridan  have given you or my self this Trouble but for the many Reports that fly about of which 'tis said you are the Author And since I have advanced so far I must go a little farther and make a few honest  Queries  then giving you a little Advice shall submit to the Determination of the Publick whether I as it has been insinuated ever intended you the least Prejudice or on the contrary have not always acted towards you with good Manners and good Nature  First thenhave I not your Letter by me sent to me when in  England  wherein you express yourself very desirous of my acting in the same Theatre with you and are solicitous for my coming overAnd do you not know your particular Application since my Arrival was one of my strongest Motives for playing in  SmockAlley  where I am likely to have a Lawsuit for my Right with the Managers tho' I was offer'd the same Terms from  AungierStreet  Playhouse where my Agreement would have been sign'd by a Gentleman of Honour whose Pay is as good as the Bank  Have I not on your Return to the Stage this Season in Compliment to you play'd some inferior Characters which 'tis well known I had a long Time resign'd to younger Actors in  England  Did I omit any Care or grudge any Pains to keep the Audience in Temper when your sudden Indisposition prevented your playing the first intended Night of King  Lear  Or could I for a Brother have been more Active to silence the Reports then made to your Prejudice  sed Tu Brute  Have not I desir'd you tho' our remaining Nights of Playing were few and we had large Sums at Stake to fix the Plays to your own Mind  Have not you been paid a large Part of that fresh Agreement you made but did not compleat while we are unpaid our Agreements tho' we have 'tis notorious often solicited the Managers to release us if they found the emptiness of the Town would not answer their  contining our PerformanceBut we could get neither our Liberty nor our Money  Have not you often been an Earwitness of these Proposals and as often declar'd we behav'd with the greatest Lenity and strictest Honour  Did not your sudden breaking off from Playing leave us in a displeasing Dilemma And was it not reasonable for us to propose acting such Pieces as might excite the greatest Curiosity in the Town whereby the Managers might be enabled to pay us and the rest of the Company  Did I not decline 'till your positive Declaration that you would play no more this Season appearing in any Character you had perform'd And did you not express yourself as oblig'd to me on making you that Compliment as you were pleas'd to term it  How comes it then Mr  Sheridan  reported that Mr  Giffard  and myself have intended you any injury Or from whence is it said that we ridiculous as false lock'd up your Cloaths and did all we could to prevent your Playing This Sir has been so frequently asserted as a Fact related by you that you ought as a Friend to Truth to have fully answer'd such monstrous Falshoods or may we not reasonably suppose you did spread such Reports If you can be the Author of such Tales what Language is fit to paint you  The Letters I read this Day in the  Dublin Journal  if not  ipso facto  yours are yet so worded an impartial Reader cannot but see they were at least the Work of some mistaken Friend whose good Nature you had imposed on by false Relations From whom but you could come the  satisfactory Reasons not one of which are mentioned  for your not performing Or the poor low Invectives and mean Inuendoes therein containedWhom do you mean by  Designing Wrelches  and  Theatrical Politicians  Or what can you intend but to insinuate you have been artfully drove from the Stage when you know your Absence from thence is absolutely your own Act and Deed  Fie fie stick to Truth or be ashamed of such publick Addresses or to shew your Pace after them  May not one suppose Master  Sheridan  the kind and civil Intention of these two Letters is to ereate a Disturbance in the future Audiences  But let me inform you when a Rebuff to an Actor appears premeditated and bespoke from Prejudice such Treatment may put a poor Player out of Humour but sure it ought not to put him out of Countenance  If you withdraw yourself from the Theatre for a Time must all Diversion stop till your Return If a Vintner has not  Ortelans  or any other extraordinary Dainties in the Larder will his Guests think it impertinent if they are intreated to take such homely Entertainment as the House affordsAnd if the Defects of others serve as a Foil to the Brilliancy of your Performance why should you be angry at what if you'd keep your Temper might prove so consolable to you  Dear  Tommy  don't prove such a Dog in a Manger if you don't chuse Oats why should you starve the rest of the Theatrical Cattle Have more Compassion on your fellow Creatures or fellow Comedians  But Master  Tommy  may we not shrewdly suspect tho' your Performances have been hitherto mostly tragical you have given your Mind a little Bent towards Comedy and in those Studies have taken a Hint from  Congreve  's  Petulant  Who to keep up an extraordinary Reputation was notorious under a Disguise for calling for himself at a Coffee house where he would sometimes in a Mask send in for himself wait for himself nay and not finding himself would frequently  leave a Letter for himself  Faith you are highly in Luck in improving a Hint I sind  But let me ask you a home QuestionHas not a great deal of that fuss of Mind you have lately shewn been m  re owing to your Disappointment that the Audience would not depart when you declar'd your high and mighty Displeasure because you had not the selfsame gew gaw tinsel Train more than from any Fears you had of having displeas'd them Or was it naugry because any one was permitted under great Disadvantages meerly to attempt what they had never in their Lives a Thought of performing  Why this is the passionate Extravaganza of your Brother PISTOL who scorning all Contradiction or Competition bounces about in his Boots kicks his Heels with Fury against the Stage and swell'd with swaggering Rage and Nonsense cries  "Shall Dunghil Curs confront with  Helicon  cShall Packhorses and hollow pamper'd Jades of  Asia  that cannot travel thirty Miles a day compare with  Caesar  and with  Cannibals  and with  Trojan Greeks  c c"  But as our Friend concludes  "Shall we fall foul for Toys  Tho' I don't think there is any thing personally terrible about you yet I own you a Gentleman of great Formidability who have the Power if you say true and you know you have talk'd at that pawpaw Rate of calling down the Barracks on any one you condescend to be displeas'd with Pray do you mean the Stone Buildings for I can't suppose you presume to have any Command over the Gentlemen there as I never heard of any Commission the King had yet honour'd you with and I believe there is hardly any there will think it worth their while to attend the Call of your Whistle to a silly Riot I am rather inclinable to think the  Gallant  Spirits there are more impatient to attend the Call of a Trumpet at this glorious Juncture and be in Actions worthy of themAnd for the Gentlemen of the College Sir no Insinuation shall make me dread ill Usage from those whose Birth and Education will never suffer 'em to hurt the Innocent nor can I affront 'em with so ungenteel a Thought that they will be the Tools of your wrongplac'd ResentmentMr  Sheridan  your Behaviour has extorted this from me and as your Conscience must tell you I never meant you the least Injury should you by any little Art aim thro' Pique or Passion unhospitably to hurt a Stranger it would be an Act that wants a Name and require such Language to answer as would but ill become the Mouth of a Gentleman or be sitting for the Ears of the Publick  As my Stay here will be short I but desire what I will not doubt meeting with a candid Reception for the few Nights I have to play from the goodnatur'd  Town whose past Favours I am proud of to confess them is an Act of Gratitude Nor will I therefore think my self liable to the Imputation of a boasting VanityLet me Mr  Sheridan  give you this friendly CautionDo not run into an Error most young Men in our Business have been too guilty of who think their Merits are but barely paid when their Reception is most favourable and take that as their Due which is mostly the Effect of a generous Disposition in the Town to encourage and support a rising Genius whenever it appearsTho' People may be as fond of such for a while as Gallants are of a new Mistress yet if Vanity and Caprice prevail in such Performer grown wild and wanton with Success they know when to withdraw their Favours nor is it easy to regain themIf I ever see you in  England  I'll be most unmercifully reveng'd of you for your Mistakes towards me and will absolutely endeavour to make your Reception there as pleasing to you as you may have wish'd mine should have been here displeasing to me But let us now mind our Business and no more trouble the Publick with our TheatricalImportantNothingsThey will but laugh at us for our Pains  I am yours c T C  A POSTSCRIPT added to a New Edition of the foregoing Epistle occasion'd by the Disturbance at the

July d  AS there were many Witnesses of the tumultuous Riot which you occasion'd last Night at the Theatre for which the Town are highly oblig'd to you  I shall make no Reflections on it but leave the Relation thereof to the Impartial and Unprejudic'dI say you occasion'd for the Pretence of the College being offended is a meer Pretence They are Men of Reason and will not resent without a Cause Nor is it a Reflection on the Society that a few may be misled by their mistaken Partiality to you that ought no more to bring an Odium on such a large and worthy Body than that you were once an unworthy Member thereof which the Majority by this time probably wish you ne'er had been  Your Behaviour Friend  Thomas  has been so bad I doubt if the smallest or lowest Body of People would chuse you to mingle with 'em I searce believe the most indifferent Troop of Stroling Players would chuse to rank with you Yet 'tis methinks a Pity You should not be quite lost to the Stage since tho' you are not equal to all Parts there are two I'll venture to say you'll always make an extraordinary Figure in I mean the Characters of MASKWELL and SCRUB You seem to have study'd and practis'd them thoroughlyI can't suppose my Frankness towards you can have offended any Set of Gentlemen Are you not free to answer for yourself in any Manner you think proper And as to the Gentlemen of the College I here solemnly declare I am not conscious of having design'd the least Offence to 'em in Word in Deed or even in Thought  Would any friendly Monitor convince me how 'tis possible for me to have said or done ought to the Offence of any one in this Kingdom you Master  Tommy  excepted I should be asham'd not to acknowledge my Error and would readily as I ought ask their PardonBut why should I wonder at your unhospitable Attempts towards a Stranger when you could so unmercifully threaten even a Brother with being ill used if he presumed to play any Part of yours this is a Fact naughtypaughty  Tommy  too well known by many for you to deny  But pray Sir by what Act of Parliament do you lay this monopolizing Claim that even during your Absence from the Stage no one must presume to appear  in any Part you please to call yoursThou dear MockMonarch have Copper Crowns and  Tinsell'd Robes  so elated thee as to think thy Commands are absoluteI wonder you have not publish'd your royal Mandate to all the Theatres in his Majesty's Dominions that none shall dare attempt any Character you have but thought ofThou really seemest to be such a choice Sort of a Monarch as your Brother  Tommy Thumb  's King  Arthur  Why while the Stage looks gloomy from your Absence do you not cry out with him  Let nothing but a Face of Grief appear  The Man that smiles this Day shall ose his Head  That he may have no Head to smile withal  But pray sweet meager Sir where did you prudentially retire during this noble Riot were you solacing your cal  e Carcass and keeping up your poor Spirits with Punch or Claret and smiling at the Clangor of the distant WarMr  Pope  has a Line draws thy Picture strongly in such Circumstances  A Fiend in Glee ridiculously grim  Really lovely Youth I am no  Quixote  to fight Windmills nor yet a  Drawcansir  to encounter Multitudes nor an  Jago  to attack Men in the DarkBut there is no Terror in Master  Sheridan  alone nor can he wear any Shape himself will ever make me alter an honest Purpose or prevent my telling him any necessary Truth In short use no Fallacies to betray mistaken Numbers into your Cause and I shall but despise you  Approach  Thou  like the rugged  Russian  Bear  The arm'd Rhinoceros or  Hyrcaman  Tyger  Take any Shape but  That  and my firm Nerves  Shall never tremble or  revive  a While  And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword  If any Sinew

CATO on  Thursday  next at the Theatre Royal in  Aungierstreet  being positively the last Time of his performing this Season with several Entertainments of Dancing by Monsieur  Mullement  Trinity College  July  AS our just Indignation against Mr  Cibber  and the Method which we took to shew it has unexpectedly brought Mr  Sheridan  under the Censure of some People we think ourselves bound in regard to Truth and that Innocence should not suffer to declare that Mr  Sheridan  was in no wise privy to the Advertisements which we put in the  Journal  and was indeed hardly personally known to any of us who drew it up that when he had seen it in the Papers he came to us and requested in the most earnest manner that not one of us should go near the Playhouse on  Thursday  Night out of Regard to him we comply'd and determined not to go After we had made this Promise came out Mr  Cibber  's Letter in which to leave Mr  Sheridan  entirely out of the Question we ourselves were attacked by the manner in which he treated our Advertisement Such Insolence from a Person of his Character tho' it deserved the highest Punishment yet should we not have carried Matters so far had we not heard and the Event justified it that Mr  Cibber  had a Party of Ruffians and other desperate Fellows to oppose us Notwithstanding all this Series of Provocations we are willing to suffer him to play for his own Benefit or any other Characters that are sit for him provided he behaves himself well Mr  Sheridan  having earnestly intreated us that we might  As there were some of Distinction and Merit then present who might have taken Exceptions to our Behaviour that Night we publickly disclaim any Design of offending them which we should have done at that Time could we have been heard  A Letter from ONE to ANOTHER Containing Arguments  PRO  and  CON  relating to the Dispute between Mr CIBBER and Mr SHERIDAN  SIR  THE present Contest between Mr CIBBER and Mr SHERIDAN having without my Concurrence or that of any one of my kindred revived the Animosity which so long held us at Variance I cannot forbear expostulating with you on so unhappy an Occurrence more especially when for this considerable Time past nothing has been more commonly the TownTalk than that all Differences were made up between  One  and  Another  and that they were at present in perfect  Unity  which I assure you gave every  One  great Satisfaction let  Another  take it as he would for my own particular part it pleased me because every  One  was weary of the perpetual Noise and scandalous Reports that were raised concerning Squabbles between  One  and  Another  I cannot but assume to myself some Merit in as much as  One  alone hath ever been willing as I now am of making an Overture of Reconcilement between  One  and  Another  though at the same time I have all Mankind on my Side who at all Times declare their Opinion in the most publick Manner and from which no  One  ever did dissent that no one ever differed with a Friend or Acquaintance but by means of  Another  was ever any Mortal accused of any Ofrence or Crime how heinous soever but he though personally convicted of it laid the Fault on  Another  and at the very worst when no Excuse can be had to palliate what is laid to his Charge will he not say  That Another tempted him  Nine out of Ten that ever were laid in Prison have they not said It was because they were bound for  Another  Nay if any Person should be occasionally Complimented perhaps for the only good Action of his Life will he not say That it was done in Service of  Another  to whom  he never was obliged and who after shewed him Ingratitude I speak of this meerly as the common Opinion which you well know to be such and I might add to this the great Superiority which I bear over you in the Esteem of the World in all Perfections whatsoever If for Instance in Conversation any Present should extol  Another  for any good Quality either for Integrity Valour or Wit nay even Money which is the Foundation of all Things esteemed reputable I say for Instance supposing there were twenty Gentlemen present was it ever known that the remaining Nineteen would not aloud or as the reigning Fashion is among wellbred People in saying their Prayers mentally tell him he must except  One  Was it ever said in  Duelling  the singular and proper Entertainment of the  Beau mond  'Whenever any of this distinguishable Part of the human Species being set together by the Ears by  Another  and do really and actually behave not as rational Creatures but to shew they have some Pretentions of what kind soever to  Manhood  '  Will it not be universally said that  One  hath wounded or perhaps kill'd  Another  In Disputes at Law either they their Heirs Executors Administrators and so forth  One  ever obtains Judgments or Decrees commonly both against  Another  and though either should appeal to the House of Lords of  England  it is always allowed to be for  One  against  Another  This I defy you to deny for you cannot but know that I can prove it upon Record which though it should be expensive yet as you have some Cause of Knowledge of my Temper you must be convinced that there is no  One  who would not hazard his Soul which you may maliciously alledge no  One  makes much Account of but that which ought to be dear to every Gentleman his Reputation to have Revenge against  Another  but as to Life or Fortune you know there is no  One  who is really a Gentleman but disposes of Both on very slight Occasions Happy would it be for the World as well as for themselves that such should punctually dispose of both together which though indeed seldom yet sometimes happens and often more by good Luck  than by good Guiding In short Sir to end this Argument which I believe you scarcely will presume to controvert since the World was  One  however endeavoured to get a Superiority over  Another  and ever hath succeeded excepting some few Instances as when  One  hath had all Advantages of a War  Another  hath had all the Advantages of a Peace but this is an Affair of such a Nature that through a Multiplicity of Affairs  One  is excusable in having overlook'd it besides it is of so little importance that it is scarce worth the Attention of any  One  neither need he be solicitous to court the Embraces even of the lovely willing Nymph OCCASION whatever Advances she may make him and in whose Power alone it is to remedy such an Oversight But let the Affairs of this World be conducted as they may the Wise acknowledge that it is all  One  or at least it will be so some time about one hundred Years hence as such of them as are skilled in Astrology have often assured me by Word of Mouth nay went so far as to say that they would give it me under their Hands or to any  One  they having a great Esteem for my Family annexed to a proper Scheme of Calculation on which they would depend their whole Reputation That no  One  now alive should ever complain that they were thereby deceived And all This  Gratis  Writing in any  One  's Commendation I know is irksome and tedious to  Another  because the Animosity between us is such I must say the Fault is yours that you cannot be brought to believe any Thing favourable of me more than I can of you but admitting this as a Truth I would with all the Moderation I have ever been Master of recommend to your serious and deliberate Thought whether any Variance or Animosity of what kind soever should come between  One  and  Another  by any Dispute which might arise between Mr CIBBER and Mr SHERIDAN For my part I speak only as  One Another  may take it as he plea  es that the Matter in contest between those two Gentlemen in my humble Opinion very little if at all concerns either  One  or  Another  but  the Attention of all  Europe  being  Happily  awaked by this and some other Matters of Importance as every  One  wishes his own Ease and never enjoys Satisfaction 'till he finds it is impossible to obtain it I would I confess for my own sake make any decent or Gentlemanlike Advances towards an entire Peace and will fully acknowledge all wherein I am conscious I ever gave you Offence hoping you will take it well that I use a little Asperity which you cannot but indulge me in you being an  Author  and of consequence  dealt  in Satyr towards which your own Conduct could not fail to furnish you with a great deal of tho' possibly not sufficient Materials for a Livelihood all Writers of every Class not excepting such as were never in a Class at all many of which being supported by the Printer for abusing themselves in the most outragious Manner in suffering the Press to groan with their Labours and bring forth Brats to publick View when all Endeavours of their Friends to procure Abortion proved abortive  I first therefore admit that many a  One  has wilfully abused and slandered  Another  yet notwithstanding this the partiality of the World towards me is such that the entire blame hath ever been laid on  Another One  I confess hath often defrauded  Another  but is it not most certain that  Another  has been equally culpable and moreover in the Opinion of the World  Another  is a greater Rogue than any  One One  may have betrayed  Another  but is that any excuse for  Another  who has often done the like both to  One  and  Another  which Circumstance doubtless aggravates the Offence in the Opinion both of  One  and  Another  These few Instances many more the like I could produce but as every  One  abhors prolixity and tedious recitals I shall restrain my Hand especially what more I might say being equally known both by  One  and  Another  and proceed more directly to the Matter occasioning the present Difference between  One  and  Another  It is a surprising thing to me that Mr SHERIDAN's not thinking himself fine enough should ever be a  Cause of Contest between  One  and  Another  and unhappily at a Time when every  One  wished to be reconciled with  Another  To do both  One  and  Another  Justice I must confess that on a late Occasion when  One  refused to do his Duty  Another  endeavoured to do it for him but can that in any manner justify  Another  for busying himself in an Affair where neither  One  nor  Another  had any manner of Concern If the Spoils of  Julius Caesar  were offered unto  Cato  as the Historian  Titus Livius  in his Decade XII relateth and that Highspirited Stoick Philosopher as Mr CIBBER in his Letter Page affirms cast them aside with Indignation of what great Importance is that either to  One  or to  Another  Especially that unhappy incident having happened at a Time when our very Grandfathers were scarcely thought of It is true it may cast some Reflection on the Wisdom for which  Cato  is so celebrated by all the Antients to a Man and is celebrated for it by our own Countryman Mr  Joseph Addison  tho' he has thought fit to put it in the Mouth of an Enemy in the following Words  viz  CATO the World talks loudly  of your WISDOM  We might indeed amuse ourselves in Discourse on so odd and out of the way an Occurrence and console ourselves with the Reflection which naturally occurs from thence that wisest Men have ever had their  blind Sides  not excepting even  Solomon  the Magnificent Emperor of the Turks so renowned for his Adage but why should  Another  take upon him to ill treat any  One  on Account of a Blemish in the Character of so great a Man as  CATO  By what appears to me this is wholly calculated and intended on set purpose to revive the usual Feuds between  One  and  Another  and as far as any Forecast  One  can be supposed to have which  Another  may equally attribute to himself this Affair must terminate in a Paper War in which you cannot but know  One  is as well able and willing to undertake as  Another  which if not speedily prevented shall be prosecuted with the  utmost Vigour of  One  as well as  Another  Mean Time I beg leave to subscribe myself  Yours c  Dublin  July the d  P S  Your speedy Answer may prevent much Mischief  Mr SHERIDAN's Address to the Town  I Was in hopes I should not have had Occasion to trouble the Publick any more but farther Misfortunes falling on me and farther Crimes laid to my Charge have put me under the Necessity of Vindicating myself  It has been said that I spirited up the Scholars to prevent Mr CIBBER's preforming last  Thursday  In answer to this I most solemnly declare that upon reading the Advertisement which they had put in  Faulkner  's  Journal  without my Knowledge out of Zeal to my Interest I made it my Business to find out the Gentlemen who had drawn it up and by all the Arguments I was Master of drew a Promise from them that they would not go to the PlayHouse the above Night For the Truth of this I appeal to themselves They have already publish'd an Advertisement in  Reilly  's Paper of last  Saturday  in which they have entirely clear'd me and given Reasons why they altered their Resolution Most of these Gentlemen I was hardly known to if I had had a Design to have form'd a Party in the College I think it was most probable that I should have applied to such as I had the Pleasure of knowing I appeal to them then or any of them whether I ever spoke to them on that Head unless it was to use their Endeavours to prevent any such Resolution being enter'd into  Tho' the Publick may have but little Regard to my bare Word on this Occasion yet if they consider that after so solemn a Declaration if what I say be false I put it in the Power of any one of these Gentlemen at  any Time to prove me a Scoundrel if they consider how low I must fall even in their Opinions should I give what they know to be a Lie under my Hand in a publick Manner I hope no one will think that I would with my Eyes open commit such a Piece of Folly  I well knew the fatal Consequences of forming a Party and too well foresaw the Use my Enemies would make of it to my Disadvantage For indeed what could I propose to myself by it but to bring the Hatred of the Publick upon me and what End would it answer I never look'd on Mr CIBBER as an Antagonist of mine I always had so mean an Opinion of him in his Characters in Tragedy that I would not even wish that he should have the Reputation of being such by any Opposition made on my Part I hope the Publick will readily believe that I had no Cause to be afraid of his appearing in any Character of mine  As to the impudent and scurrilous Epistle which Mr CIBBER publish'd I was determined to take no Notice of it for I thought him in every Respect beneath my lowest Resentment I did not care to wrestle with a Sweepchimney But as I find there are a few who do not know the Man led away by his false Representations and as he has endeavoured to abuse that noble Principle for which this Kingdom is so justly famed and which I hope we shall never lose I mean that generous Spirit of Hospitality derived to us from our Forefathers to his own wicked Ends and Purposes I think it necessary for my own Sake and for the Sake of the Publick to unmask this  Jago  and lay him open to the World In order to do this I shall beg Leave to state one Fact  The Night that I was to have performed  Cato  an unfortunate Night for me when a thousand unforeseen Accidents had thrown me into such a disorder'd State of Mind as I had never known before I found of a sudden Mr CIBBER's Behaviour which before was very complaisant or rather meanly submissive was totally changed instead of trying all Methods to appease a Person beside himself with Passion he did all he could  to aggravate Matters When I asked him what I should do in this Exigence for want of a Robe He answered somewhat shortly play without a Robe When upon that I laid open to him what a despicable Figure I should make he turn'd upon his Heel and said Dn me if I care what you do the Play shall not stand still for you and immediately went and ordered the Prompter to draw up the Curtain When I heard this I was stunn'd at the Insolence of the Fellow who neither had any Right to command in that House nor was in any Shape interested in the Event of that Night It put me past all Patience and the Terror I was under lest the Curtain should be drawn up before I had Time to make an Apology at a Time that I found myself incapable of playing made me rush like a Madman precipitately on the Stage before I had considered what I should say to the Audience Mr CIBBER to my great Surprize came on immediately after me and very officiously to give it no harsher Term offered to read the Part of  Cato  at the same Time that he was to play  Syphax  I say officiously for if I can make it appear that he was no way concerned either in Point of Interest or Money the World will judge so too  Mr CIBBER knows that the Actors had determined to seize on the Receipts of that Night and all the succeeding ones except the next the entire Receipts of which were to have been mine to pay themselves their Salaries of which they had been defrauded by the Roguery of some of the Managers He knows that the Reason of his continuing to play on afterwards was only to fulfil his Agreement that he might have an Opportunity of suing the Persons he contracted with for the Sum stipulated He knows notwithstanding his plausible Pretence in his Epistle for chusing the Characters which he gave out that he intended to perform in these Words  "And was it not reasonable for us to propose acting such Pieces as might excite the greatest Curiosity in the Town  whereby the Managers might be enabled to pay us and the rest of the Company  "  I say he knows that not a Shilling of this was either to go to the Managers or to them He knows that he had a Lawyer's Opinion That it was not necessary for  him to perform the Number of Nights mentioned tn their Agreement it was sufficient if he was ready io perform them in the limited Time He knows that he reckoned into one of the Number the Play of the  Rehearsal  which was dismissed the Night before What then could prompt Mr CIBBER to make such an extravagant and impudent Proposal to the Audience as that of reading the Character of  Cato  when at the same Time he was to play  Syphax  I say what could prompt him to give himself so much unnecessary Trouble if he was no way obliged to it either in Point of Duty Interest or Money It was a malicious and wicked Scheme which he had long had in Agitation and which my Misfortune that Night first gave him an Opportunity of putting in Practice It was a Design of building his Fame upon my Ruin  In order to prove this I shall first of all give a short Account of my Behaviour to Mr CIBBER since his Arrival in this Kingdom To proceed in his own Method I shall beg Leave to ask him a few Questions  Is he not conscious that had it not been for me he could not have set his Foot on any Stage in this Kingdom  Did I not quash a Cartel which was signed by the Managers of both Companies under severe Penalties to exclude him from acting on either Stage  Did I not as a Stranger treat him with all Civility tho' the unhappy Character he labour'd under prevented my having any Friendship with him  Was I not a principal Means of preventing the Trial between Mr  Sloper  and him and the Letters which passed between him and his Wife from being reprinted here soon after his Arrival And did I not commission a Friend to offer the Expence of the Impression out of my own Pocket rather than a Stranger should be hurt  Did I not promise him to study any new Character for his second Benefit A Favour which I had refused to others much more worthy of it  Did I not when I found Mr  Philips  trifling with him and refusing to perform the Contract before his Face declare that I never would in any Shape be concern'd with Mr  Philips  hereafter if he did not pay  him nay more offer'd to play with Mr  Cibber  in the other House to try by that Means to make up his Loss  Did not Mr  Cibber  say on that Occasion that I behav'd with such Honour and laid him under such Obligations that he only wish'd for an Opportunity to return them  The first he had was the above mention'd unhappy Night Might not one reasonably expect after all this that Mr  Cibber  would not try to injure me if I did nothing to injure him But he had worn the Mask too long he found an Opportunity of throwing it off and leap'd at it with the greatest Eagerness notwithstanding the many Obligations I had laid him under to me he could not forgive me that my Name brought full Houses when he was obliged to dismiss or to play to empty Benches His Envy Spleen and Malice which long lay smother'd in his Breast now burst forth into a Blaze He saw me under the Necessity of disappointing an Audience and consequently disobliging them He contributed as far as in him lay to the one and was determin'd to improve the other  I have already shewn that he was not obliged by any Principle of Duty or Profit to this Work of Supererogation it must be then from some other Motive  Complaisance to the Audience perhaps  Impudent as he is he cannot think that the doing so unprecedented a Thing as that of reading a capital Part and playing another at the same Time could give them any Pleasure an Attempt which no one but himself could ever have thought of and which even his own Hardiness must have been shocked at had he not had the blackest Malice in his Heart to prompt him to it He saw the Audience greatly offended at the Disappointment they met with in my not being able to perform and very justly too fince it was not in my Power to give them the Reasons which prevented it He laid hold of this Opportunity at once to run me down in the Opinion of the World and ingratiate himself by the Appearance of an officious Zeal  to do every Thing that might give Pleasure to the Publick  He hoped by this Means to drive me out of the Kingdom and to establish himself  here for the next Winter as he knows it is impossible for him to return to  London  This is the more probable as I had often declar'd in Confidence to him that I should never be able to stand the Shock of any Party form'd against me His subsequent Behaviour is a manifest Proof of his Design For after I had left the Playhouse and sent Word in the Heat of Passion that I should never play there again Mr  Cibber  for fear I should cool upon it or try to reconcile the Favour of the Town to me again in a violent Hurry gave out three Plays together a most unusual Thing unless in case of Benefits in two of which he was to appear in Characters of mine By this Means let me have been ever so innocent had not the other Company been in Town I must have quit the Field to him and left him triumphant  This was not all  When I endeavour'd to vindicate myself to the Publick and make an Apology for not performing Mr  Cibber  undertook to answer me What Right or what Colour like to Right had he to undertake it I made no mention of him in the Paper which I publish'd tho' I had a just Reason to do it because I did not care to be embroil'd with a Man of his trouble some Temper who has always kept every Theatre in which he was engag'd in hot Water I had hitherto had no Quarrel to him I had done him some Favours should he not if he had the least Humanity to leave Gratitude out of the Question have endeavour'd rather to clear me in the Opinion of the Town than endeavour to hurt me I cannot find that he himself has given any tolerable Colour for his entering so eavalierly a Volunteer in the Cause His setting out where certainly he ought to have given some Reason for his undertaking such a Part is no more than this  "Mr  Sheridan  Your injudicious Disappointment of the Company last  Thursday  who expected to see you in the Character of  Cato  and your indiscreet Attempt to dismiss the Audience having as you confess become a Towntalk and given Rise to many idle Falshoods merely calculated to injure the Innocent you must excuse me if I relate the Fact strictly adhering to  Truth"  So that here he does not pretend to give any Reason only  You must excuse me  Here and thro' the whole Epistle you may observe by his illnatur'd and bitter Expressions his personal Pique and Spleen to me who never had injur'd him Mr  Cibber  mentions in the Course of his Letter that he heard I had spread about several Reports to his Disadvantage but why did Mr  Cibber  whose Motto to this Epistle is  It is a kind of Slander to trust to Rumour  so readily believe those Reports of one with whom he had hitherto liv'd on a good Footing Mr  Giffard  had heard the same Thing in regard to himself but he like a Gentleman came and ask'd me the Truth of it and I satisfy'd him Why did not Mr  Cibber  if he had the least of a Gentleman about him behave in the same Manner before he ventur'd to publish them to the World and draw Conclusions from them as Truths to my Disadvantage No Mr  Cibber  neither wanted nor wish'd that I should justify myself his Affairs were grown so desperate that he had no Hope left but by a Train of villainous Calumnies and a Prosusion of scurrilous Language to try to make me do something monstrous to plunge me still deeper in the Displeasure of the Town at least he had Hopes that this Conduct might rouze perhaps the indiscreet Zeal of some of my Friends or Wellwishers to attempt something against him which he would be sure to lay at my Door Unhappily for me the latter Part succeeded to his Wish  To prove that this was his Principle I shall only make use of one Argument I shall not pretend to justify or condemn the Gentlemen of the College it is not my Business and the World may easily see how ticklish a Point that would be for me to handle All I shall endeavour to do is to prove that Mr  Cibber  knowingly and willingly brought it upon himself He treated the Advertisement which they had put into the  Journal  in a contemptuous and insolent Way on a Supposition that they were mine But no one shall make me believe that any Man of common Sense as I will allow Mr  Cibber  to be could suppose me either foolish enough or base enough to do it Had I wrote such an  Advertisement in the Name of the Gentlemen of the College was it not natural for them to enquire who it was that dar'd to make use of their Name and had I done it what Punishment would have been too great for my Presumption  Mr  Cibber  might easily have known of Mr  Faulkner  whether they had left it there or no Upon this Probability then that he must have known it was theirs what could Mr  Cibber  expect from a Set of young Gentlemen who are thro' their Youth warm What could he hope for but that they would shew their Resentment for this contemptuous Manner of treating what they had wrote Nay must he not expect that probably they would think themselves bound in Honour to take some publick Method of convincing him that they had wrote it lest the Calumny which he had cast upon me thro' their Silence should be fix'd upon me People may wonder that Mr  Cibber  should run such a Risque from such a Motive but he has been so accustom'd to Things of this Nature that they appear to him but as common Matters The Pleasure he proposed to himself in having an Opportunity of displaying his Eloquence the next Day of throwing at the Feet of the Publick  an unfortunate Stranger unhospitably us'd  and above all the joyful Hope of being able to fix this Disturbance upon me as it's Author wou'd he thought more than compensate for any Thing he could suffer  Mr  Cibber  is the more inexcusable as I took all Pains to prevent his doing any rash Thing which might draw more Odium on him from the Gentlemen of the College I told Mr  Wright  and several others of the Players that it might reach his Ears that I had been with the Gentlemen of the College to prevent any Mischief not for Mr  Cibber  's sake for I owed him no Favour but my own That I had laid open to them the ill Consequences that would attend me should any Disturbance happen at the Theatre that upon this they had all promised in a solemn Manner not to go and I bid them assure Mr  Cibber  that he need not fear any Interruption Notwithstanding this he published his Epistle afterwards wherein the Gentlemen of  the College thought themselves personally illtreated and were rouz'd into such a Rage as no Endeavours of mine or all Mankind could have appeas'd  Does not this Conduct of his evidently prove that he shut his Eyes to Conviction that he was determin'd at all Events to pursue the Scheme he had laid down it either must be owing to this or to the strangest Infatuation that ever possessed Man As to Mr  Cibber  's Postscript I read it without any Emotion and heartily thank him for it He has there painted himself in stronger Colours than either I could or my Humanity would suffer me to do His ridiculous Challenge in the true Stile of an  Ancient Pistol  sent to me by all the NewsBoys in Town I despise He has put himself by his Behaviour far beneath the Footing of a Gentleman I shall go about my Business as usual if I am attack'd I shall endeavour to defend myself nor shall I ever be afraid of any who dare do Wrong And now I have done with himI am sorry I have been compelled to shew any Man in so bad a Light but the World must do me the Justice to own he has forced me to do it in my own Defence I shall trouble my Head no farther with him but leave him to Heav'n  And to the Thorns which in his Bosom lodge  To goad and sting him  It is now Time I should address myself to the Publick There are two Things laid to my Charge one is That I spirited up the Gentlemen of the College to raise a Disturbance in the TheatreA heavy Charge indeed if true I have done all that is in the Power of Man to clear myself of it and I hope there is none of the least Humanity but will acquit me The other is That I willingly disobliged the Publick in not playing the Part of  Cato  I published an Apology not without consulting a Gentleman of great Knowledge and Experience in the World in it which perhaps the over Easiness of my Friends thought a sufficient Defence Perhaps indeed I imposed on myself as well as them  If there be any who think I meant them an Offence that I did it thro' Wantonness or thro' Contempt of the Audience I heartily ask their Pardon and the  only Way I have left to make them Amends is to exert myself in that Character on  Thursday  next if they will honour me with their Company that Night The Matter is come to this Issue that I must either rise or fall in the Opinion of the World by the Event of that Night If I am the Person Mr  Cibber  represents if I was an unworthy Member of the College which my old Cotemporaries there and those Ornaments of Learning the Fellows who knew my Behaviour will hardly take his Word for if I am not fit to be received in a Company of Strollers for which Compliment the many People of Fashion who have honoured me with their Acquaintance in private and their Approbation in publick are much obliged to him I am not indeed worthy of your Countenance You all know me I have lived amongst you if I have the least Title to your Favour I hope the Goodnature of my Friends and the Benevolence of the Publick which I have so often and in so extraordinary a Manner experienced will not desert me in this Exigence nor suffer me to fall a Sacrifice to the mean Artifices and be banished my Country by the wicked Schemes of ano I will not put myself so much on a Level with him as to call him by the Name he deserveswho I am well assur'd dare not shew his Face in his own  If any Expressions too warm or indiscreet have drop'd from me in the Course of this Address I hope for the Indulgence of the Publick when I inform them that I have been obliged to draw it up almost in the space of one Day and that too in no very easy state of Mind For I question whether the innocent Man tho' he has great Advantages over the other feels less than the Man of Guilt while he is labouring under a Load of Calumny My whole Intention was to endeavour to clear myself with all Duty Deference and Submission to the Publick whose humble Servant I am  THOMAS SHERIDAN  A proper REPLY to a late scurrilous LIBEL entitled Mr SHERIDAN's ADDRESS to the Town  Parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus  What damn'd costive Poet hast thou been reading  CONGREVE  Pray Sir when you write do you let Blood and take Physicke or make use of stew'd Pruants only  Vide  the REHEARSAL  And write about it Goddess and about it  POPE  Wednesday Afternoon July  WHEN I call this a  Proper Reply  I mean such a one as may be  fitting for the Publick to read  and  not  such a one  as  Sheridan  ought to receive  Without playing the Critick on his nonsensical tautological Stile and rambling Inconnections I shall only take this Notice of his Scurrility Foul Language in an Address to the Publick is an Affront to their Ears 'tis a Breach of good Manners and almost as unpardonable as throwing Glasses  c  in Company There's neither Wit Sense Pleasantry or Bravery in eitherThat it is said by many that  Mr  Sheridan  spirited up some Persons to create a Disturbance in the Theatre  is a known truth and it is also a truth that many firmly believe it from wellgrounded Reasons SHERIDAN  's  pretending to know nothing of the Advertisement and Letter first publish'd in Mr  Faulkner  's Journal is not at all surprising after many other Things he has modestly ventur'd to assert even when Numbers know the contrary Mr ARNE told me at the  Rainbow Coffeehouse  on  Wednesday  last in Company with several others that he had been just talking with Mr  Faulkner  at the  Globe Coffee house  who among other Things declared his Opinion That it was indiscreet in Mr  Sheridan  to cause or suffer such Things to be publish'd 'twould be more likely to prejudice than serve him  c  and that he had advis'd Mr  Sheridan  to the contrarywhose Reply was  He was determin'd  Besides this 'tis notorious he had several Persons  to dine or sup with him on different Days and had lost no Time nor spared any Money in Chair Hire  c  to alarm all Parts of the Town as well as his particular Intimates he was an injur'd Person forsooth tho' in what has not yet appear'd Add to this his previous Declarations to any one's appearing in any Part he had thought of playing his threatning them with an ill Reception from his Friends over whom he boasted a particular Sway no great Compliment to them by the way and what must we think of this Man or what Regard ought the Publick to have either to his Word or Oath  The Riot that ensued on the  Thursday  following is known to the whole Town their Sentiments of it will better come from their Mouths than my PenThe Town's generous and uncommon Reception and Protection of me since was an Instance what an Abhorrence they had of the former rash Behaviour of a few misled by a very bad ManI must have Recourse to his Vocabulary e'er I can find Words low enough to paint him The extraordinary kind Treatment the Publick afforded me on  Monday  Night in the Character of Othello I am conscious was more owing to their spirited hospitable Usage of a Stranger than any Merits my Attempts to please them could lay claim toI have a sincere and grateful Sense of their Favours it warms my Heart and I shall always think it a Duty incumbent on me loudly to acknowledge an Act so much to their Honour I confess it here and shall not forget it when in  England  to which Place I propose returning speedilytho' the modest the brave Mr  Sheridan  whose Veracity is to be ranked with his other Virtues is pleased to assert the Impossibility of my returning I shall contradict him by Facts not by dirty Language  Let me inform him all bad Expressions retort upon the Slanderer let then his own scurrilous Libel stick on himself till he wipes it off like a Gentleman His Affectation of treating me with Contempt as an Actor is such a pretty Piece of presumptive Vanity that his choice Opinion alone should lead the Town and such a paltry Puff of his own Praise as is only fit to be  laugh'd atBut how if the  Great Sheridan  should have given something under his own Hand quite contradictory to this mean Opinion of a Man  whom  he says  he had no Cause to be afraid of  What will Gentlemen think of  Tommy  then Whyas they think of him alreadyAs I chuse Facts rather than meer Assertions to contradict his Calumny and Falshoods I desire the Patience of the Publick to read the following Letter sent from Mr  Sheridan  to me in a Letter inclos'd to Mr  Giffard  then in  London  the Date says when  A true Copy of Mr  Sheridan  's Letter to Mr  Cibber  March d  SIR  THO' I have not the favour of being known to you yet I make bold to write to you about an Affair in which you are concern'd as well as I  I hear the Gentlemen of  Aungierstreet  Theatre intend to make Proposals to you about a Summer Expedition to this Kingdom  as I had some Thoughts of doing the same in favour of the People of  Smockalley  this Intelligence has hasten'd my Application to you personally which otherwise might appear too abrupt There are many Reasons why  I should think it our mutual Interest to play in one House  In the first place if we act in different Houses the Town will possibly be divided and the Receipts of both will necessarily be much lessen'd Not that I should expect this upon the footing of Merit but I know not how it is whether it be their Partiality to their Countryman or whether it be owing to the powerful Interest of a Number of Friends that I have in this City but there never was known such Encouragement such Applause given to any Actor or such full Houses as since I appear'd on the Stage Mr  Giffard  will inform you that  Dublin  is not like  London  we have not two Audiences in the whole City especially  as the Town is now more empty than it has ever been known  Besides as it is not improbable but that we may be together next Winter it will be a great Advantage to practice such Plays together as we can both appear in  I am commission'd to assure you from the Managers of  Smockalley  and I will also do it from myself that you shall  have all the Encouragement that you can expect they are as willing and they are as well able to do it as those in  Aungierstreet I should be obliged to you if you would let me know as soon as possible whether you have any design of coming hither what are your Terms and how soon it would be convenient for you to come You may think  it is my own Interest that has prompted me to write to you  'tis very true  I have no small Cause to be afraid of so potent an Antagonist  but I believe upon mature Deliberation you will also find it your Interest to be with us If you will favour me with a speedy Answer you will extremely oblige  Your Admirer and very humble Servant THOMAS SHERIDAN  To this I wrote an Answer I believe not unbecoming a Gentleman to send or a Gentleman to receive  Sheridan  may print it if he pleases I hope he won't alter it tho'As I have been honoured with a Message from the Heads of the College to signify their Detestation of the outrageous Proceedings at the Theatre on the Night  Othello  was first intended and those Gentlemen having absolutely disclaimed any of the Advertisements being any Act of the College but on the contrary look on 'em as a Reflection and Affront on that worthy Body  let  Sheridan  make 'em Libellers not I  I say  SheridanSheridan  who carried that Piece of Rhetorick last  Friday  to Mr  Faulkner  who prudentially  chose not to affront his worthy Fellow Citizens  as he declar'd to  Sheridan  indeed Master  Tommy  to soften it it seems alter'd the Word  Butchers  to  Ruffians  a tender Apellation and then was angry with Mr  Faulkner  who positively refused to insert it Some other Printers did insert it who have confessed  Sheridan brought it to 'em  Here it may not be improper to transcribe  Sheridan  's third Paragraph of his modest Address  c  Tho' the Publick may have but little Regard to my bare Word on this Occasion yet if they consider that after so solemn a Declaration if what I say be false  I put it in the Power of any one of these Gentlemen at any Time to prove me a  SCOUNDREL if  they consider how low I must fall even in their Opinions should  I give what they know to be a  LIE  under my Hand in a publick Manner  I hope no one will think that I would with my Eyes open commit such a Piece of Folly  O  Sheridan Sheridan  Quae te dementia caepit  You little thought when you wrote this that Mr  Faulkner  had declar'd his refusing the Advertisement or that Mrs  Reilly  had sent Word to the College that  You  brought the Advertisement to her in which  you  chang'd the Word  Butchers  to  Ruffians  and by which in the Name of the  abus'd College you  clear  yourself  of knowing any thing of the Matter Any one may be satisfied of the Truth of this who will give themselves the Trouble to call at the Printers  As to the Insinuation of my procuring Ruffians as the well bred  Sheridan  may stile them to be at the Theatre I appeal to the Publick if I have not always in any Discouse I ever held on the Subject made it my earnest Request every Step should be avoided that might disturb the publick Peace and I hoped none would be omitted to preserve it If any honest Man will step forth and say I have not acted thus or ever desir'd any one to be present to give me a forced Applause let this I say be proved and I'll bow me to the Shame  Tom Sheridan  deserves for all his Falshoods  In answer to the Message I was favour'd with from the College as aforementioned I begg'd my humble Respects might be acceptable and tho' I was pressed to mention the Names of those who were concerned in the Disturbance I desir'd to be excus'd since as I was a Stranger to their Persons I might possibly be misinform'd and tho' I had been advised to address the Provost on this Occasion nay farther to apply for a Lord Chief Justice's Warrant to be served on the AggressorsI declin'd all Proceedings of this Sort tho' I have an undoubted Right to the Protection of the Laws equal with any of my fellow Subjects I had Charity enough to consider this as an inconsiderate Act of warm Blood and more the Effect of Partiality to this artful Man than any ill will to me I imagined their cooler Reason would disprove it I believed  their Judgments would not repeat it and I declared without fresh Occasion never to disturb any one about it I have kept my Word  But to go on with you Sir Pray what were those thousand unforeseen Accidents that so disorder'd your dear Mind on the fatal Night you mention Why have you not recited 'em I call'd on you to do it in my Epistle to you Did you not appear to every one very tranquil till there was no great Hopes of a crouded Audience still your Philosophy prevailed till it appear'd the Robe did not appear that indeed  "  inflam'd your noble Liver and made you rage  "  well but  "on a sudden Mr  Cibber  's Behaviour which before was complaisant or rather meanly submissive a generous and grateful Expression for my treating you all along with more Breeding than you deserv'd or probably ever understood or practis'd "was totally changed"  This Assertion every one behind the Scenes that Night can deny I appeal to Mr  Giffard  Mr  Wright  and many others there if I did not advise you like a Friend and a Gentleman not to do an indiscreet uncivil Thing toward the Audience let  Philips  or any one be to blameand so  "on my ordering the Curtain to be drawn up you rush'd precipitately on the Stage"  These Lies are as monstrous as the Father of 'em I never ordered the Curtain to rise till the Audience accepted my Offer of having  Cato  read Did you not undress yourself from Head to Foot and positively swear to me and several you would inform the Audience you would not play on account of your Disappointment Were you not in your own Cloaths when you appeared And did you not farther even then  He will outlie a Chambermaid or a Woman of Quality's Porter  CONG Way o'the World  abuse the Ears of the Audience with saying  Philips  had lock'd up your Cloaths tho' many saw you dressed for the Part as aforementioned  If I chose to Play on to fulfil my Agreement which the Managers would not release me from was I not rightThe Actors you say determin'd to seize on the Receipt of that Night to pay their Salaries  'Tis true  You  Mr  Morris  and Mr  Wright  agreed they should have that House not having received any Salary for three WeeksBut you propos'd to receive the next for your self alone And had taken care to seize the best Receipt taken at  your Playing  viz the first Night of  Cato  which did not amount to forty PoundsWho then acted honestly I whochose not to dismiss the Audience or you who to the disappointment of the poor unpaid People would have depriv'd 'em of the Receipt of that House by a Dismission What could I propose by Playing on but justly to fulfil the Agreements on my part which the unfair Managers would neither release us from nor Pay us for Certainly I ought to take all legal means to recover what I have been so unjustly depriv'd of The Dismission of the  Rehearsal  a Play too often repeated given out by  Philips  on a ByDay against the Sense of the Company when you were yourself afraid of Playing was the imprudent Act of  Philips  tho' at the time the Audience were sent away every one allows there was a better Prospect of an Audience than there was at the same Hour to the Play of  Cato  If my offering to the Audience to read  Cato  and Play  Syphax  was as your Wit and Modesty terms it an impudent and extravagant Proposal what sort of Language would you bestow on them who allow'd of it if you durst The trouble was not unnecessary tho' fatiguing enough it was both my Duty and Interest to act as the Audience directed And  by their Appointment  I play'd  Syphax  and read  Cato  I wonder you have not publish'd your Displeasure towards them for the terrible Mortification your little Pride mean Vanity poor Envy and rancarous Heart felt from the unbounded Goodnature they shew'd me on that OccasionBut this it seems  Tommy  says was a malicious wicked Scheme I had long in Agitation Sure I must have dealt with the Devil  Tommy  to have foreknown you could have acted so suddenly as you did the part of such an extravagant Fool Who could have suspected it And why should I Chicken wish to build my Fame on thy poor Ruin I question if I did not pass for an Actor of Reputation when you  probably eat SpoonMeat to build my Fame upon such Ruins were as low as a General's hoping to gain Reputation from his laying siege to and demolishing a set of Cotts or Cabins I ask pardon for the sudden Extravaganza of the Comparison as far as it relates to the Officer but shall not apologize for what part relates to you You will be honour'd by any Comparison  Well but  Tommy  says my Fame was design'd on his Ruin to prove it he'll give an Account of his Behaviour to Mr  Cibber  since his Arrival in this Kingdomvery pretty Reasoning this truly  How was your Behaviour to prove my Design  Prithee Boy go to School again learn to make Themes and to mend your MannersWell to proceed  Tommy  will ask Mr  Cibber  a few Questions which have no Analogy nor are at all apposite to any Question Mr  Cibber  has made  Tommy  no Sophister  Tommy  can't answer 'emVery well Child go on I'll answer your Questions They are as follow  Quest  Is he Mr  Cibber  not conscious that had it not been for me he could not have set his Foot on any Stage in this Kingdom  Answ  How could I be conscious I could not without your Assistance set my foot on any Stage here after you had by Letter of Complement invited me to one Theatre and Mr DESBRISAY and other Gentlemen Men of Worth and Honour had by Message and Letter of Attorney granted to Mr SWAN who came to  England  on purpose invited me to the other Needs there more be said to this  Quest  Did I not quash a Cartel which was signed by the Managers of both Companies under severe Penalties to exclude him from acting on either Stage  Answ  How came  your Power  to quash a  This  Cartel  was idly design'd to exclude all  English  Actors from the Theatres here  Cartel Or  who had a Right to make such Cartel  That Mr  Swan  he is absent therefore to be treated tenderly drew one is certain that some injudicious People sign'd it I believe But still  Aungierstreet  was open to receive  methe same Terms proffer'd menay would I have engag'd alone double the Terms which I am now to get when I can But Mr  Sheridan  's particular Application and Perswasions have drawn me into an Agreement I have but too much Reason to Repent  Quest  Did I not as a Stranger treat him with all civility tho' the unhappy Character he labour'd under prevented my having any Friendship with him  Answ  And so thou condescending Creature didst treat me with all Civility And pray why should not youor could you suppose you would not hear of it whenever you behav'd otherwise I think you have and I believe you will stillOh but my unhappy Character prevented your having any particular Friendship with me I shall always think it a happy Part of my Character not to have been too far inveigled by you and a Happiness in my Circumstances that you have given me timely Warning not to enter into any Intimacy into which my goodnatur'd Credulity and your wheedling Cunning might have betray'd me I have suffered too much already 'tis well known by such Caitiffs  Quest  Was I not a principal Means of preventing the Trial between Mr  Sloper  and him and the Letters which passed between him and his Wife from being reprinted here soon after his Arrival And did I not commission a Friend to offer the Expence of the Impression out of my own Pocket rather than a Stranger should be hurt  Answ  You say but we have only your bare Word for it which is now in no great Estimation you prevented the Trial between  Sloper  and me being printed I don't know you did nor do I believe you did and I am sure I don't care whether it's printed or no Time Truth and undeniable Facts have open'd the Eyes of Mankind so much in my Behalf on account of that unhappy Affair that I have no farther Anxiety about it nor dread any Imputation on my Honour or Honesty therebyAs to the Letters between me and my Wife whenever they are read all sensible impartial Readers will readily allow me to  be tho'a weak an unfortunate Man a hurt Lover an injur'd Husband and a Friend betray'dBut how dare you thou unspeakable Wretch mention my Wifeor what wouldst thou intimate I defy my direst Enemy who dares speak Truth to say that ought ever happened between us but what too fatally has prov'd me to be  One who lov'd not wisely but too well  As to Mrs CIBBER I shall only at present say of her the Amendment of her Conduct joined to her Merits as an Actress having gained her the Good will of many and restor'd her to the charitable Thoughts of a kind World I will scorn tho' wounded in the deepest Manner Human Nature can feel ever to use any low Invectives against a Woman or to obstruct her future Quiet or her Happiness unless and I hope there will be no Occasion some future Cause should call upon my Honour as a Husband to put that Power in force which my Humanity would be shock'd to be driven to the Necessity of executingBut say thou unnatural Thing of Nothing unknowing as your nearest Friends aver either of the Joys or Pains of Love thou hateful Stranger to the Ties of Kindred or real Joy of Social Friendship what but the most rancrous Heart of the  most base infamous Villain and notorious Poltroon  could have drawn this disgraceful Paragraph from the Gall of thy invidous Pen Those Epithets I many Times have us'd in most publick Places in publick Print or  viva voce  and ever shall join'd to the Name of  Sloper  Nor will the Name of THOMAS SHERIDAN henceforward be ever mention'd by me but the same Epithets will be heard or understood That a Gentleman of Honour in this City did prevent the Republishing of the abovemention'd Letters I have reason to believe and must think it design'd as an Act of good Nature in him as not willing either should be hurtBut your stopping 'em I know nothing of any more than I do of the Obligations you would intimate I have to you unless you mean it an Obligationthat I have accidentally done you the favour to dine with you when I might have pass'd my Time more agreeably in better Company  Quest  Did I not promise him to study any new Character for his second Benefit A Favour which I had refused to others much more worthy of it  Ans  You did promise to study a Part for my Benefit tho' I did not want you to do it but you since said you'd play no more and if you have refused that mountainous Favour as your own vain Imagination paints it to worthier Persons I think as every one will you were very much to blame  Quest  Did I not when I found Mr  Philips  trifling with him and refusing to perform the Contract before his Face declare that I never would in any Shape be concern'd with Mr  Philips  hereafter if he did not pay him nay more offer'd to play with Mr CIBBER in the other House to try by that Means to make up his Loss  Quest  Did not Mr CIBBER say on that Occasion that I behav'd with such Honour and laid him under such Obligations that he only wish'd for an Opportunity to return them  Ans    and  When  Philips  trifled and behaved ill enough as he knows not how to behave well you did talk of being concern'd no more with  Philips  and of playing with me in another House which you thought it would be your Interest to do I made you several Compliments on that Account which on Reflection were more than you deserv'd for a Proposition you had no Right to make since you were then actually engaged with  Philips  in Articles for some Time so could not keep your Word And whenever you play the Players too well know how much your own Interest will be consider'd before the Welfare of any one Person or the Interest of the whole Body  May one not reasonably suggest you rather chose to play with me that my good Nature or good Manners call it Indolence if you will might decline any Part you wish'd And if the allsufficient  Tommy  held my Playing in Tragedy so cheap whence all these unnecessary Cautions of his against my playing in that Light Or his Endeavours before I appeared in the Kingdom to imprint in the Minds of some People these Things can be proved  Tommy  my Incapacity for such Performance  Or whence his present Anger avow'd against any Attempts of Mine of that Sort Indeed Child your Heat betrays you here it outruns your Cunning And so your Name brought full Houses when we play'd to empty Benches The worst Houses I have seen here were when you play'd indeed Youth you should remember the Old Saying  Fibbers should have good Memories  Not one full House have I seen you Play to since I cameThe first Time I ever saw you on the Stage was in the Play of  Julius Caesar  when the Curiosity of seeing your Brother in  Cassius  was what the Managers depended on for bringing the Audience I was told there was then about  l  You play'd  Lord Townly  for a Widows Benefit to about  l Hamlet  I believe to less tho' for a Benefit too  Richard  to less than  l  and caus'd about  l  's worth of Tickets to be given away to Puff for you  c  The best Receipt you had was to  Cato  which I have mention'd and the first Night of your appearing in the Character of  Horatio  in the  Fair Penitent  was worse than any of these and I believe the very worst Audience they have known a long whileWhy you're bewitch'd sure  Sed Quos Jupiter Vult perdere prius dementat  That you have disoblig'd an Audience by not performing more than once that you have created Disturbances more than once the whole Town knows But that you were always under the Necessity of so doing nothing but the Nonsense of thy own peerless Pericranium could ever persuade you to assertCan any one in their Senses suppose I could undertake so wild a Project as to attempt driving you out of a Kingdom you were born in and in which you had as you often boasted such a strong natural Interest Or why were I to stay or ever to return must my Establishment be grounded on your Removal Upon my Word Incomparable Sir I cannot pay you so great a Compliment as to think that necessary Nor do I think thou egregious  Mock Monarch like thee  of  monopolizing Kingdoms  or as you in your Letter to Mr  Gk  ridiculously enough phras'd it of  dividing 'em  or that  we are to be  as you farther said to him  The Twin Stars of Heaven  c and such like Trash which his better Sense as I am credibly inform'd smil'd at But I suppose the Town here are to dread your threatning to depart and join in a Petition for your Stay should you cruel Man leave this weeping Nation to deplore your Absence for a while I'll venture to affirm your Return will be pretty quick Unless you can persuade every body in  England  to hold every Performer as low in their Opinion as you do when comparing 'em to your inimitable selfAll Men have some Degree of Vanity without it there would be but little Emulation But yours is so barefac'd so stupidly apparent a Schoolboy would act with more DiscretionHowever cordially partial you may be to your dainty delicate self I shall not forfeit my Understanding so much ever to hint you have the least Right to stand in any Degree of Comparison with Mr  Quin  or Mr  Garrick  whatever your critical Noddle may be pleased to alledge or with many more there or some here who in their different Walks will always be your Superiors  As an Actor tho' I have more to say to you as a Man I shall yet leave you for a while This Answer already swelling to a large Size But shall take an Opportunity of shewing you impartially what you are and what you are not When probably the judging World will take their farewel of thee with this Parody  Thou art but a stalking Shadow a Poor poor Player  Who hast strutted and fretted thy hour upon the Stage  And nowThou'rt heard no more 'Twas a Tale  Told by an Ideot full of Sound and Fury  SignifyingNothing  'Twere endless to trace you thro' your repeated Falshoods or to take Notice of all your  Sheridaninian  rhetorick Numbers can confront you as to the First and as to the Latter 'tis fit only to be laugh'd atBut out of thy own Mouth will I condemn thee wicked Scribler You say yourself  Page    th    "  The Audience was greatly offended at the Disappointment they met with  in your not being able to perform  and very justly too since it was not in your Power to give them the Reasons which prevented it  "  No nor  ever was Nor ever will beNow if  Tommy  will but correct it boldly and instead of  not being able to perform  read thus  Not willing to perform  why then the Fact will be truly stated I believe  You say being equally skill'd in theatrical Affairs as you are in Laws of Hospitality and good Breeding  "The giving out three Plays together is a most unusual Thing"  No  Tommy  it has been frequently done in  England  where the Theatres are somewhat better conducted than here or they would be in a woeful Plight and the Company on such Occasions have been greatly serv'd thereby Oh But some of the  Characters  were  yours  Pray  who  are  you  What do you mean that they fitted you in private Life I'll readily allow you all the Virtues you can find cram'd into  Richard  or  Macheth  their Valour and their Policy excepted little cunning that betrays it self is no Policy but the Pangs and Pleasures of  Othello  sure you don't pretend to have knownOh But you mean they were your Parts and pray why the Property of you particularly any more than of many others who have acted 'em before you and 'tis possible don't play 'em worseBut you would not play and nobody else mustPert enough that  You say what Right had I to answer your first Address to the TownWhy Child I never did answer it My Epistle was ready for the Press before I ever saw your Paper as a Gentleman can testify who brought it to me just as I was going to send away my Letter 'Twas your idle Reports which Numbers have known you guilty of and the two illnatur'd Advertisements which no one believes you innocent of calculated to create a Disturbance and the silly threatning Papers posted up about the Town All these made me think it necessary to break Silence  Your Nonsense in saying I keep every Theatre in hot Water is very pretty to be sure if you did but know what you meant but as to my troublesome Temper there is not I believe a Player that will not contradict youI am confident there's none of the Profession here that will find Fault with my want of Manners good Nature or good Humour But is  there any of 'em that have not laugh'd at your ridiculous Tyranny or been astonish'd at your ill Usage even of the WomenBut they should excuse you there  Tommy  How can you tell properly to treat a Sex every Body believes you're scarce acquainted withand so  "You cannot find out any tolerable Colour I had to be so cavalier a Volunteer in the Cause"  Really too many publick and private Libels press'd me to the ServiceBut 'tis no Matter whether you can find the Cause or no if the Publick finds it and if they are pleas'd  "Must I be fright'ned 'cause a  Spalpeen  Stares  As to your pretty Compliment to your Friends by calling their Zeal indiscreet that Blunder needs no Remarkand to say I knowingly and willingly brought the Anger of any Set of People upon me is an Assertion so absurd nothing can equal the Folly of it but the Falshood'Tis a pretty plump Contradiction to the forc'd Compliment you make when you are pleas'd to allow me a Man of common Sense But your Effronterie in denying all Knowledge of the Advertisements or having even the least Knowledge of the Gentlemen whom you pretend were angry on your Accounttho' living Witnesses have prov'd and will farther your being deeply concern'd in publishing the first and that you were daily and hourly in Company with the latter as you confess in your own Libel is matchless  indeed  Such glaring Contradictions prove you thought your Readers must be as silly as your self and would overlook them  'Tis notorious the College resenting the Freedom of the Printers in publishing Papers as coming from them which they disclaim have on Enquiry found SHERIDAN  brought 'em  SHERIDAN  set 'em on  For this Truth let any one appeal to Mr  Faulkner  Mr  Exshaw  Mrs  Reilly  and their Servants  c  You talk of a Message you sent me by Mr  Wright  of your having endeavour'd to appease the Anger of your Friends  c  You took care to send the Message late enough For I received none till within half an Hour or thereabouts of my Letter being cry'd about the  treetsBut I no more believe your Sincerity in  this than I do in every thing elseThe Impatience of those itinerant Gentry the Flying Stationers being great I must hasten to a Conclusion they farther inform me if I swell this to an enormous Size 'twill not be so portable as they could wish Nor can they afford it for so small a Price as a Penny That I may therefore neither inconvenience their Traffick or incur their Mightinesses Displeasure I shall give you but a few Words more and then leave thee  To those Thorns which in thy Bosom lodge  To goad and sting thee  And so the whole Intention of thy long elaborate Piece is to introduce a whining begging Paragraph in behalf of your Benefit thou Prince of Canters and thou King of Maunders Is it come to this Does this agree with  Tommy  's dauntless Declarations he never did nor ever would ask any one to come to see him 'Twas to oblige themselves not him they came  c c  "Is that too modest and gentle  Mr Bays  No but 'tis very great  and as farfetch'd a Fancy as ever was known  How are the Mighty fallen  But this prodigious Work the learned  Tommy  did not take up much above a whole Day tho' by his late Publishing it 'tis possible he may sib there too to draw upMiraculous Why what an amazing Author you may prove in Time But prithee how could'st thou be so long about it I have a Child shall write twice as much Nonsense in half the Time and be more asham'd of it when doneAnd was its state of Mind uneasy Good Lack You question whether the innocent Man feels less than the Man of Guilt while he is labouring under a Load of CalumnyReally I can't readily answer you Calumny you have endeavour'd to load me with but as I know no Guilt I cannot say I have felt much Anxiety of Mind Nay I am so innocent of any base Intentions that I solemnly declare I sleep very sound and am very easy Try if you can do so too And  Rest perturbed Spirit Farewel Remember me  T C  A Letter from Antient PISTOL to Young PISTOL who acted that Part on  Monday  the st of  August  at the  Theatre  in  SkAy  Being an Epistle  From the Dead to the Living  Thou Dog in Forehead  POPE's Hom  SIRRAH  IT is with no small Discomfort and Anxiety of Mind I hear so exploded a  Rascal  as you should by imitating my noble Character endeavour to recommend your self to the World as a second  Pistol  a Fellow so little Heroick either in Mind or Gesture that even the Character of  Scrub  had been debas'd by you had not there been other inferior Parts in Plays such as Footmen Bailiffs and Tapsters thy Impudence in assuming mine had been more excusable but every other Act of your Life as well as this demonstrates you were born to bring that Vice to Perfection which before did but faintly appear in the awkward Gestures of half impudent and half bashful Men Nay to such a Pitch of Transcendency have you carried Impudence that even thine own Father Old  Colley  whom none will charge of being over modest begins to be asham'd of you But  Sirrah  neither thy commencing Pimp Sharper Poet or what is baser still a self will'd  Cuckold  carries such Aggravations of Impudence with them as your affecting to play my other Parts you might have play'd without having straining for or deviating from the common Course of your Lise but surely Heroism as little becomes you as Majesty would a Clown or Military Weapons a Taylor yet under all these Disadvantages of Body and Mind must I forsooth be personated  I whose lofty Stile employ'd on greatest Things  Might well become the Mouths of mightiest Kings  Thou prophane unmeritable Wretch may the mighty Gods condemn me to the lowest Tortures if I am not sick when I think of you and yet such is my  cursed Destiny I cannot put thee out off my Thoughts so much thy Impudence provokes meWell you cannot live alwaysa Time will come when thy ugly Soul freed from that Cage thy Body shall descend to these gloomy and dreadcreating Shores then shalt thou find Wretch yea even then When all thy worldly Debts shall be paid thou shalt here find a Score the payment of which shall anniliate your Soul even to Horror thy worst Fears at which you are pretty apt will not let you conceive how I'll use you  I'll spurn you under my big  Boot  as an Elephant would a Bear's Cub or the Jackcal of a Lyon it shall avail thee little that thou art the Son of a Laureat such Laureats as he I despise you are as good a Poet yourself and yet by G if you can find me any earthly Scribler besides him who writes as ill as you I'll forgive you however injur'd I may be from the very Bottom of my Heart But this Ingagement you will never be able to perform and so the Enmity still holdsI hear you are now after selling your Native Country arrived in  Ireland  and thinking thy self far enough removed from the Scene of your former Roguery settest up for a new Man of Honour well of all thy Impudences this is without Dispute the greatest To say there were one or two greater  Rascals  in the World than yourself were a Brag might easily be dispens'd with but to defy any Man to find a Flaw in your Honour who never was known to have any is like Playing as you Actors Phrase it the Double for who the Devil that was but half Sober would look for a House in a PepperCorn but perhaps thou takest Honour and Baseness to be like the two halves of one Circle and he who comes to the Extremity of one must of Consequence be at the Beginning of the other if it be so Grammercy Right HonourableI wish you Joy of your new Title which I promise you fresh as it is will last no longer than you have an Opportunity of contracting a new Debt or the persuading some few credulous Creatures you are capable of being a sincere Friend or an innocent Companion  No no  Sirrah  would you ever hope to come at the Character of an honest Man it must be by inverting the present Notions concerning Virtue and Vice could you by any cunning Sophistry pesuade Mankind that Falshood was Truth Dissimulation Sincerity and Malice good Nature and so of other Vices you might stand fair sor the first Place in the List of honourable Gentlemen but while the present set of Maxims prevail you must content yourself to be held and that deservedly as the basest of Mankind  Thus I think I have given you some Reasons why I should resent your appearing in my Character seeing the Nobleness of it cannot but suffer thro' the vile Action and worse Fame of the Performer Desist therefore from ever assuming that Part nor Cowardly take the Advantage of my Absence to Insult me least too far provok'd I may be tempted to trespass upon the Edict of  Pluto  and quitting these Shores resist once more the Mansions of my former earthly Habitation in order to the obtaining due Satisfaction  NOR think the Space that is our Shores between  Shall thy vile Carcase from my Fury screen  Wing'd with fierce Wrath and Wrath's a Mountain thing  From this to thee as Lightening quick I'd spring  And when thou dost supine at Midnight snore  Lock'd in the Embraces of some favourite Whore  Or if too poor to keep a Drab in pay  Thou liest alone and dreamest of some Play  I'll come and cloath'd with Terrors of the Night  Thy trembling Soul from its base Lodgings Fright  Me as a Gorgon trembling thou shalt own  And quick convert your brazen Face to Stone  Or if my noble Soul disdains a Slave  So base as you should fall by one so Brave  Some Imp directed by my high Commands  Seizing the brimful Jordan where it stands  Shall down thy gaping Mouth its Freightage pour  And quench your Soul in an unsavoury Show'r  So shall Men say when you've resign'd your Breath  Who stinking liv'd has dy'd a stinking Death  PISTOL  A Letter from a Young LADY to Mr CIBBER  Mr CIBBER  I BELIEVE you will think this comes very late by Way of Answer to a Paper you publish'd dated th of  July  entitled  A Proper Reply to a late scurrillous Libel  c I have been in the Country for this good while past and heard nothing of your Quarrel with Mr SHERIDAN till the Day before Yesterday when the abovenamed Paper was put into my Hands by a Gentleman who at the same Time related the Occasion of your Dispute to me I must confess when I first cast my Eyes on your  Reply  I imagined I should have been of your Party but when I had read a few Pages of it I own I changed my Mind and began to suspect that the Gentleman had been a little partial in his Account  You begin with letting the Publick know  "that to address them in foul Language is an Affront to their Ears and a Breach of good Manners"  A very hopeful BeginningAnd would not one imagine that a Gentleman who thought thus would write nothing contradictory to such an Opinion but would at least keep within the Bounds of common Decency in his Expressions Yes certainly and Mr CIBBER is so conscious of the Heinousness of using ill Language that he most religiously avoids it as I shall take Notice of more at large presently In the mean while I shall proceed in Order to your several Paragraphs  "Mr  Arne  say you told me at the  Rainbow  Coffeehouse that he had been just talking with Mr  Faulkuer  at the  Globe  Coffeehouse who among other Things declared his Opinion that it was indiscreet in Mr  Sheridan  to cause or suffer such Things to be publish'd  c c  "  A  Printer's Opinion  Why Man  if it was a Stadtholder's you could not deliver it with more Solemnity poor  Faulkner  is an honest Fellow but for God's Sake don't talk of his  Opinion  Well in the next Place you inform us  "Mr SHERIDAN spar'd no Money in Chairhire to alarm all Parts of the Town"  Why this is not like  London  Chairhire is very cheap here and you may go almost from one End to the other of our poor little City in an Hour's Time and it won't cost you Nineteen Pence if you don't believe me prithee for once make the Experiment  Now to come to your Promise of good Manners againYou say  "you will contradict Mr SHERIDAN by Facts not by dirty Language"  Very good still I am in Hopes you will keep your Word but we shall see that presently In a few Lines after this you call him the  Great Sheridan  and by and by  Master Tommy  there is no Scurrillity in this I grant you but indeed my Friend there is a little Malice and a little Childishness in itBut to come to a more material PlaceYou ask Mr SHERIDAN  "Why he did'nt recite those thousand unforeseen Accidents that disorder'd his dear mind  c  "  Why indeed Mr SHERIDAN should in Justice to himself have been a little more explicit with Respect to them Accidents whatever they were but is it not possible I speak to you as a Man of common Sense now and leave the Dispute quite out of the Question is it not very possible that a Man may by a hundred little concurring Incidents so trivial in themselves that they would scarce bear a Repetition yet at the same time may make a great Impression on a delicate Mind be really so disordered that it would be actually impossible for him to exert himself properly at some particular Junctures Certainly nothing is more true Instances of this Nature are seen frequently and I knew a Lady who put off her Marriage Day and dismissed the impatient Bridegroom with all his Train because she was disappointed of her Wedding SlippersI think this is a parallel Case with the one in Question  But to go onYou say  "you treated Mr SHERIDAN with more good Breeding than he deserved or probably  ever understood or practised"  An admirable Instance of your good Breeding this and a great Compliment to the College where Mr SHERIDAN received his Education Do you remember you are talking to a Gentleman one who was born such and educated such and it is to be presumed conversed with none other till the Narrowness of his Fortune reduced him to the sad Necessity of being Company for the Gentry of the Stage This Kingdom I own is much  honour'd  by your Presence and is likely by your Means to improve as much in good Breeding as it will in the Regulation of the Theatres The Man of Manners is a Character I find you affect and keep up notably but really till you undeceiv'd me I always thought a  Player's Politeness  was much of a Size with a  Printer's Opinion  You tell us  "You offer'd to play  Syphax  and read  Cato  "  I will not call this an impudent and extravagant Proposal but I cannot help saying there seems to be a good Deal of Art and Design in it What could you propose by such an Offer but to make Mr SHERIDAN's Behaviour in refusing to act appear in the worst Light when opposed to your kind Candescension in taking upon you to act two Parts which was the Case in Effect when he totally refused to appear in one You knew the Audience must have an ill Impression made on them for the present from such a Refusal You take them in the Mood and out of your great Affection to them like an obliging Creature chuse the Fatigue of playing two Characters a Thing perhaps not so new to you where that little obstinate perverse Chit SHERIDAN wou'dn't as I said before play oneKind indeed but between you and I I suspect you in this plausible Intention and am apt to believe there was more Illnature than Complaisance in it  But come you advance apace with your Court Breeding  "The Good Nature you say was shew'd you on this Occasion you wonder didn't provoke Mr SHERIDAN to publish his Displeasure against the People for the terrible Mortification his little Pride mean Vanity poor Envy and rancarous Heart felt on this dismal Account"  Now from Envy Hatred Malice and all Uncharitableness good Lord deliver us  Pray how do you know that Mr SHERIDAN was so much mortify'd Softly or you will betray yourself and easily discover that the Pleasure you propos'd to yourself in mortifying your Antagonist was a Motive much more prevailing with your social humane Heart to act as you did than that of obliging your Audienceis not this trueWell here you quote Mr SHERIDAN's Expressions  "  Tommy  as you call him says your Fame was design'd on his Ruin and to prove it he will give an Account of his Behaviour to you since your Arrival in this Kingdom"  Very pretty Reasoning this say you how was his Behaviour to prove my Design This it seems was a high Joke to you but pray have a little Patience had Mr SHERIDAN only related his own Conduct towards you without mentioning any Part of your Behaviour with respect to him I own that wou'd be a Method of proving a little new it might indeed make the Ingratitude or Insincerity of a Man appear in blacker Colours but that it could not prove his Design must be allowed but if I don't mistake Mr  Sheridan  he gives us some Account of your Conduct as well as his own but there was no need of that the Town have been Witnesses to it and I think it is very obvious from what you have said done and wrote that your Intentions were none of the most charitable your Behaviour in the Affair of  Cato  prov'd your Designs and Mr  Sheridan  's Behaviour towards you prov'd how little he deserv'd such TreatmentWhere's the Absurdity of thisI suppose it was thus that every body but yourself understood Mr  Sheridan  tho' perhaps he did not consider it so distinctly  I shall pass over that Part of your  Reply  which is by way of Dialogue between you and Mr  Sheridan  because there are some private Reflections in it of a Nature too tender to be trifled with but I long to come to the Place where you shew yourself the very Pink of Courtesie I mean where you salute Mr  Sheridan  by the Name of the most base infamous Villain and notorious PoltroonCourteous and polite I confessYou told us  "Fibbers should have good Memories"  So should Railers too You seem to forget that  all  bad Expressions retort upon the Slanderer  If you believe this you have them for your Pains but you should have considered this before you gave your Pen such a Liberty  But I had like to have forgot your lofty Manner of addressing him before this  But say thou unnatural Thing of Nothing  Unknowing as your nearest Friends aver  Either of the Joys or Pains of Love  Thou hateful Stranger to the Ties of Kindred  Or real Joy of social Friendship  Very sublime I had some Thoughts of throwing it into Metre but I was afraid it would lose its Dignity and therefore chose to let it remain in Blank Verse Pray who gave you this odd Character of Mr  Sheridan  I am his CountryWoman have always liv'd in the same City with him and have been acquainted with his Name for some Years and yet I never heard that he had such a little adamantine Heart as to be insensible both to Love and Friendship he has Kindred who I have been inform'd are in some Measure oblig'd to his Tenderness for their SupportI think this is not an Argument that he has so savage a Breast as you wou'd intimate so that 'tis probable them near Friends you speak of have misinform'd you  You give us to understand that  "you have not seen Mr  Sheridan  play to one full House since you came"  I can't tell indeed what particular Fatality may have attended him since you came but I know his Name whatever Jest you are pleased to make of it seldom fail'd to bring a numerous and polite Audience Nor is it let me tell you over and above civil in you to point out any particular Night when as you say there was the very worst Audience that has been known a long Time how do you know how many Persons of Distinction and Merit might have been there I presume you are not well enough acquainted here to assirm this upon your own Knowledge Pray what do you call the worst Audience Did you mean the thinnest If you did you should have said so for the other Word I think affronts the whole Audience at once  be it good or bad Mr  Sheridan  himself didn't do worse than this  You think proper to speak with great Contempt of his Stile and as a competent Judge at once pronounce it nonsensical tautological and inconnected to be sure you can never be guilty of any such notorious Faults but pray let me ash you a Question I must first make use of your own Words to Mr  Sheridan  "I shall not say you forfeit my Understanding so much as ever to hint you have the least right to stand in any Degree of Comparison with Mr  Quin  or Mr  Garrick  or with many more THERE"  Where pray Mr  Cibber  One would imagine by your Way of putting it that  Quin  and  Garrick  were the Names of two Cities But I suppose you were dreaming of  London  when you made this Mistake and indeed I believe you were sleepy when you wrote the whole But you go on with your Comparison  "He is not on a Footing you tell us with  Quin  or  Garrick  but this is the best of it or with some here who in their different Walks will always be his Superiors"  O lamentable if by their different Walks you mean their different Gaits or Manner of treading the Stage I don't know but some of them may have the Advantage of Mr  Sheridan  but as Players I dare say not one of them would have the Vanity to offer such an Assertion  I am almost tired of you but I will go on You tell us very obligingly  "that the Theatres in  England  are somewhat better conducted than those here or they would be in a woeful Plight"  Is this a Reflection on Mr  Sheridan  in particular or on the whole Body of the Managers Which do you think really I don't know that it affronts Mr  Sheridan  at all but you fancy you will do it compleatly by and by where you tell us of his ill Usage to the Women  "a Sex he can't tell properly how to treat being scarce acquainted with"  If this were true I can't see how he is the worse for it and really the less he is acquainted with that Part of the Sex which his present Method of Life must unavoidably throw in his Way I must  say he will be the better for it but let me inform you I know some Ladies of Sense and Reputation that are acquainted with him and never found him wanting either in that Complacency which is natural to a Man of a good Understanding or that Respect which is due to a Woman of Honour for my own Part I never exchanged a Word with him in my Life and therefore can't possibly speak out of any particular Prejudice you will not believe this probably but with all due Submission to you I am very easy about that  I thank my Stars I am come to your lost Page but there is an Expression here that stops me short  "Must I be frightened because a Spalpeen stares"  What do you take a Spalpeen to be Mr  Cibber  a Bear may be or a Bugabow I believe you are not rightly apprized of the Sense of the Word and yet it may be properly enough applied to a Player they are People who labour in one Season and are Beggars in the other that is all  But it's Time to take my Leave of you which I shall do anon tho' the Flying Stationers don't press me to a Conclusion as they did you but indeed I am afraid you had to do with great Knaves for they would make you believe that if you encreased the Bulk of your Paper they could not afford it for a Penny but let me tell you as a Friend that in so cheap a Country as  Ireland  they cou'd afford ten times as much of the same Wit for half the Price  A Word or two more and then adieu I find you take the Liberty of playing upon sacred Verse as well as the Tag Ends of Comedies I should think this almost unpardonable but having a Precedent of so great a Genius I hope I may without offending venture to insert the Verse which you left incompleat your Exclamation is  How are the Mighty fallen  Pray give me Leave to add  And the Weapons of War perish'd  For believe me all the Papers you have pen'd on the present Occasion have been put to their proper Use  I am c  An Answer to the young Lady or a Letter from Mrs SLAMMEKIN to Miss TABITHA TAMMY  c  Miss TABBY  I DO indeed think your Answer comes very late and if it had not come at all Miss I don't see any great Loss the World would have had of it Miss but since you have scribled to amuse yourself why should not I do so too my dear And as I have been a great Frequenter of the Theatres both at  London  and here I think I have as good a Right to prattle and judge of Playhouse Disputes as Mrs  Anybody  for really Miss I always pay for my Place and was ever above excepting an Order from any of the Fellows whether I sat in the Green Box the Balcony or the Lattices I'll assure you Miss  So you have been in the Country for this good while past why really Miss  Tammy  I heard you retir'd to Country Solitude the Day after your Cousin  Tommy  's Benefit You were lately seen at  Laughlinslown  in your Jockey Cap and a Hunting Pole in your Hand an unbecoming Weapon for a young Miss by the way and you know how the Ladies there laugh'd at the uncouth Figure you made Dear Creature don't have any more such Flights I beg of youBut pray Miss  Tabitha  why are you so free with poor Mr  Faulkner  What has he done to deserve any Fleer from youOh I forgot he ungraciously rejected one of  Tommy  's polite Advertisements a heinous and unpardonable Crime I grant youBut dear Angel Why may not a Printer's Opinion if he's an honest sensible Man be of as much Weight as a Stadtholder'sLud that's a filthy hard Word how could you think of itAs Mr  Faulkner  's Opinion was not wrong sure it had been better for  Tommy  to have paid more Regard to it but if  Tommy  is such a Coxcomb to regard no  body's Opinion but his own why  Tommy  must take the Consequence  Pray Miss  Tabby  advise  Tommy  never more to commit such paw Tricks never more to tell horrid Fibs and write a whole Paragraph to prove himself a sad Fellow and then make you sully your pretty Fingers with Ink to excuse them But does not  Cibber  fairly charge TOMMY that HE knew and approved of the two Letters in  Faulkner  's Journal To prove this he mentions Mr  Faulkner  's telling him his Opinion That it would be better not to have them printed I grant it may be nothing to the Publick what was  Faulkner  's Opinion but it proves that Mr  Faulkner  knew  Sheridan  to be so much interested in the Advertisements that he thought his Resolution alone necessary as to the putting them in or leaving them out and  Sheridan  's Answer to Mr  Faulkner  accordingly was  "I AM DETERMINED"  Yet asterwards frontless  Sheridan  in his silly Address solemnly declares  "It was all without his Knowledge"  matchless Impudence  Tommy  cannot answer this nor has attempted it  Cibber  surther charges  Sheridan  that he himself carried the other Advertisement to  Faulkner  's where it was refused that he himself altered the Word  Butchers  to  Ruffians  and afterwards himself carried it to  Reilly  's and in which as you may see he himself declares That He himself is innocent of the former Advertisements or Letters and knew nothing at all of the Matter This is a Truth Mr  Faulkner  Mrs  Reilly  and other living Witnesses can prove  Thus then stands the FactMr  Sheridan  disappointed either at not having a particular Robe or at the thinness of the Audience or perhaps desirous to indulge his Vanity in making an Audience be dismissed though Mr  Cibber  and Mrs  Giffard  were in the Play who by that Means were to be thought os no Consequence or from  Tommy  's uneasy delicate Mind He did not chuse there should be any Play then says it was ungrateful and insincere in any Man to attempt any Character he had play'd Thus he forms wild Ideas in his Noddle of his being injured sets a Man up as an imaginary Enemy cruelly persecutes him and endeavours  by Means the most unjustifiable to Society no less than the endangering of Lives to hinder any one from doing what  Tommy  through Spleen Pique Pride and Impertinence would not do himself  By several Passages in your Letter Miss I shrewdly suspect  Tommy  has gone farther in the Character of  Congreve  's  Petulant  which  Cibber  mentions in his first LetterI question whether  Tommy  like  Petulant  besides having wrote to himself has not put on a Hood Mask and Scarf and called for himself positively it looks mighty like it I protest I'll not forgive it if like  Slender  in the Play I am to be deceived and instead of sweet  Mrs Anne Page  am to be put upon by a great  lubberly Boy  I hear when  Cibber  read your Letter he burst into a loud Laugh and cried  Stap my Vitals  Tam  again  then added with the compos'd Serenity of Lord  Foppington  Tam  is the impudentest Fellow that Nature ever spawn'd into the World strike me speechless  Did  Cibber  guess right or how dear Creature  But pray Miss  Tabby  why did you give yourself the needless Trouble of telling  Cibber  the Price of Chairhire here Sure you can't but suppose he has been idly indolent enough to have rode in one several times here as he frequently used in  London  when your Cousin  Tommy  found it much more convenient to walk on foot when  Tommy  was not plagued with the Incumbrance of a Chair a Horse a Footman or any other impertinent Equipage nor knew the Fatigue of being levee'd by Winemerchants Tradesmen  c  which his late Luck made him unexpectedly acquainted with  That  Cibber  calls  Tommy  the  great Sheridan  and afterwards  Master Tommy  is not at all inconsistent since all the World must suppose the first can be but Irony Had  Cibber  said  Sheridan  was brave just witty generous handsome genteel polite a pretty Fellow a compleat Gentleman or an excellent Actor would any one have supposed  Cibber  in earnestTo be sure my Dear you know they could notI again question whether  Tommy  not caring to shew his Face like a Man has not hid himself under a Petticoat  You own Miss  Tabby  Tommy  should in Justice to himself have been a little more explicit with regard to them Accidents  A little more explicitwhy he has said nothing at all but that he had not his fine Playthings As childish a Reason as we when we wore Bibs and Aprons ever gave for not eating our Bread and Butter when perhaps it wanted Glass Windows upon it or because our Dolls were not dressed to our Minds But I wish Miss  Tabby  you had let us into a few or any one of those  little concurring trifling Incidents that made so great an Impression on the delicate Mind of the dainty Deary as  RENDR'D HIM INCAPABLE AT A PARTICULAR JUNCTURE Oh the critical Minute how has  Tommy  lost it Oh Ged I wish he may ever get over it Well I vow Miss  Tabby  you brought all the Blood of my Body into my Face you wicked Creature You gauky Romp You wild Toad How can you give one such comical naughty Ideas  Well that Parallel of the Lady dismissing her impatient Bridegroom for want of her Slippers is apt enough and was very near as ridiculous as disappointing an Audience for want of a particular Robe 'Twas a dangerous Trial of the Bridegroom's Love Did he ever return to the LadyAnd was the Lady as handsome as pretty  Tommy  Sure  Tommy  wou'dn't disappoint a Bride for want of white Gloves and a lac'd Nightcap  But Miss  Tabby  why do you lug the College into your Epistle that's so like  Tommy  What Reflection is it on them that  Tommy  does not understand good Breeding I have heard of a Parson's being hang'd and a Soldier's being drumm'd out of a Regiment yet neither brought any Reflection on the Gown or the Army Though you and I are two prateapace Baggages does it follow none of our Sex know when to hold their Tongues But of what Consequence is it to the Publick whether  Cibber  is a Gentleman by Birth or whether any of  Sheridan  's Relations were ever transported or made their Exits at the tripple Tree But sure  Tommy  won't pretend to say he acted like a Gentleman when he did all he could to set the whole Town in a Blaze and laid Schemes for very fatal Consequences  while he has had Recourse to the meanest Falshoods basest Equivocations and Misrepresentations to shelter himself from the Tumults he wish'd to createThe Town are greatly oblig'd to him a pretty grateful Return this for the charitable Assistance they have afforded him when the Narrowness of his Fortune reduced him to the Necessity of gaining more from a Theatre through the Indulgence Compassion and Benevolence of the Gentlemen and Ladies here than ever his boasted Merits can pretend to lay claim to  Well your playing upon the  Players Politeness  and  Printer  's  Opinion  is  prodigious pleasant and pretty I protest  ah how the  P  's come in there  P upon P  or  Pay upon Pay  as  Bays  says as good as ever was wrote  What were  Cibber  's real Motives for reading  Cato  and playing  Syphax  I won't pretend to determine any more than you Miss  Tabby  or your Cousin  Tommy  oughtthat it was fatiguing is certainthat it requir'd some Art as an Actor I supposethat it prevented the Audience from being disappointed thro'  Tommy  's Vanity and Caprice is undeniablewho one may reasonably suggest wish'd as there was not a great Audience to dismiss them that it might be said there could be no Play without  Tommy  Why should we suppose any illnatur'd Design in Mr  Cibber  's Offer of giving himself so much Trouble 'Twas allow'd by the Audience an Act of Complaisance they thought he acquitted himself well And their repeated Applauses shew'd their OpinionNow as I told you Miss I have seen Plays often in  London  I shall farther inform you I have heard it said there that Mr  Cibber  has frequently manag'd a Theatre with such Success that both the Town and the Players have been well pleas'd Nay I have heard it allow'd no Actor better knows how to conduct a Theatre than he doesI suppose he did not come hither to learn that Art if there is any in itNor can any of the Directors here boast much of the regular Conduct of their Playhouses I believe  I vow Miss  Tabby  I must chide you for taking the Ld's Name in vain and making so free with any  Thing out of a good Bookhow could you say  from Envy Hatred Malice  c  good Ld deliver us  indeed Miss my Mama would have been angry with me for talking so prophanely and ludicrouslyI'll assure you Miss I'm no Prude but I know when to be decent to  You say if you don't mistake Mr  Sheridan  he gives some Account of Mr  Cibber  's Conduct as well as his ownWhy my Dear you do mistake he gives no accountI allow with you all  Tommy  could say were needlessfor the Town will always judge for themselvesThat  Cibber  has join'd the Words base infamous Villain and notorious Poltroon to  Tommy Sheridan  's Name is undeniable and after  Tommy  had impudently and impertinently mention'd Family Distresses quite foreign to the Purpose what less could  Tommy  expect or what Gentleman or Lady will be offended with Mr  Cibber  for bestowing such Appellations on  Tommy  after so just a Provocation Why does not  Tommy  shake 'em off 'Tis his own Fault if they stick upon himBut has he not dealt as freely with himself in the third Paragraph of his own Letter Does he not there under his own Hand in a publick manner prove himself an unfit Companion for any Gentleman whatever  Bad Expressions certainly retort upon the Slanderer but when the Person pointed at deserves those Expressions which I don't hear any one deny but that  Tommy  did they'll remain where they are plac'd and are only bold Truths not SlanderAs you grow critical Miss  Tabby  on  Cibber  's lofty and sublime manner of addressing  Tommy  give me leave to suppose  Cibber  might grow a little warm on so nice a Point as the mention of a Woman The Occasion appears just enough and 'tis excusable if his Stile swells a little If you or I were in a Passion 'tis possible we might elevate our Dialect as well as raise our Voices  You desire to know who gave  Cibber  that odd Character of  Sheridan Cibber  tells you his nearest Relations and FriendsYou declare Miss you have been acquainted with  Sheridan  's  Name  nothing more I hope for some Years so may every Shoeboy  my Dearest that can read For  it is to be met with underneath many an Alehouse Sign  in this City and many Parts adjacentBut why dear Child will you be so cruel to mention any of his indigent Relations for such they must be who could submit to be oblig'd to him for Support not that Poverty is any Crimebut 'tis not quite pretty to hint at the Narrowness of their CircumstancesAnd should  Tommy  boast of any Relief he may have afforded 'em would not  Tommy  by such Declaration cancel the Obligation And may we not conclude  Tommy  has more Ostentation than GenerositySure  Tommy  does not pretend to talk of any Favours he ever conferr'd on his BrotherTho'  Tommy  condescended to share with the Managers the Profits of his Brothers Playing it is not yet apparent  Tommy  ever refunded any Part thereof to his BrotherThat  Tommy  has not play'd to a full House since Mr  Cibber  's Arrival in this Kingdom is certain nor had for some time before his ArrivalThe Joke was overTho' the Gentry here are as benevolent and generous as any Nation yet it was not to be suppos'd they could throw away their Charity in one Quarter for ever  Well I vow and protest Miss that was comically thought of you to find out calling a thin Audience a bad Audience was an Affrontbut I believe you'll not easily persuade the Undertakers of any Playhouse to think a thin Audience agood oneNor would any half dozen Persons of the greatest Distinction or Merit be angry at the Expression if they were the only Spectators I have seen the royal Family at an Opera in  London  and so thin a House the few that were there all allow'd it to be a very bad Audience and not one thought themselves affronted by the Declaration  Why as you say  Cibber  does find Fault and pretty justly I believe with  Sheridan  's Stile and calls it properly enough nonsensical and tautological and adds his Matter is inconnected  c Now  were  Cibber  's Stile and Matter worse would that prove  Tommy  's good No sureWhen you quote Mr  Cibber  's Words  viz  "I shall not forfeit my Understanding so much as ever to hint you have the least right to stand in any  Degree of Comparison with Mr  Quin  or Mr  Garrick  or with many more there"  You add  where  Mr  Cibber  Why in  England  Miss  Tabby England  my Dearest  mention'd a few Lines before  Laud Child sure this must be a wilful Oversight of yours if you don't own thatI shall suspect you tho' you stile yourself a young Lady to be really an old Gentlewoman If your Sight is dim call for your Spectacles  Well you're charmingly pleasant again on 'the Words  different Walks  sure you must be mighty pretty Company I'll swear you're a provoking Creature you agreeable Devil youYou own some of the Actors may have the Advantage of  Tommy  in treading the Stage and I am sure many others will allow tho' the Actors do not vainly and foolishly like  Tommy  puff their own Praises yet the judicious I say easily discern there are Players who in their different Walks or Casts of Playing are so much superior to  Tommy  they would be paid no great Compliment by being put in Competition with him  When  Cibber  says the Theatres in  England  are somewhat better conducted than the Playhouses here I don't suppose he means a Compliment either to  Sheridan  or the Managers Might he not by such Compliment arraign his Judgment should he either extol  Tommy  as an Actor or the others as Managersmost People are of Opinion he would  That  Cibber  knew what the Word  Spalpeen  meant is pretty certain by his applying it to  Sheridan  and your Explanation of it fully shews Miss that it fits  Tommy  very well How near he was to being a  Beggar  'till he labour'd last Season in his Vocation as a Player is pretty notorious  Well as you say I am tir'd of you and my Tea waits But oh you dirty thing you what do you mean by  Cibber  's Papers

CIBBER  in the Character of Nobody  He enters in a Cloak  WELL Sirs to keep my Word tho' as I take it  You're all but fairly bit if I should break it  For what's an Epilogue when Nobody's to speak it  But least the Humour with the Cheat should lye  Thus I transform myself to Nobody  Throwing off his Cloak he appears habited in a large pair of Breechesas the Character of Nobody is often represented in Pictures  c    In this vile punning form some ancient Noddy  At first presum'd to represent Nobody  My Birth from long before the World I trace  From whence the proudest Mortals give me Place  No Interests can from such Allegiance move 'em  For who's not pleas'd when Nobody's above 'em  France  's Monarch whose Aims unbounded he  Wou'd give just Terms of Peace nay keep his Word with me  For all he toils for is the Good of Nobody  The Ties of Friendship 'twixt us well is known  To me he wishes the Imperial Crown  For while he seems to let two Rivals share it  He really means that Nobody

in your Favour  Fair ones at what I say take no Offence  When his Degree a Lover does commence  You coin an  Ass  out of a Man of Sense  The Beaux that softens most your flinty Hearts  Are  Asses  Taylors make them Men of Parts  Now some have told me this might give Offence  That riding my  Ass  thusIs riding the Audience  But what of that the Brother rides the Brother  The Son the Father We all ride one another  Then as a Jest for this Time let it pass  And he that likes it not  May kiss my Ass  A PROLOGUE Spoken by  CIBBER  August  th on the Ba  Dettingen  TOO long has  Britain  been by  France  amus'd  Her Peace invaded and her Faith abus'd  While  Europe  's Freedom in the Ballance hung  And faithless  Lewis  like a Syren sung  To sooth our Monarch whose Supplies alone  Repell'd his Force and shook the  Gallic  Throne  Tho' slow to Vengeance pow'rful in the Fight  The great Assertor of all  Europe  's Right  Such  Brunswick  is and such alone his Aim  How great the Motive and how just the Fame  If to repel obtruding Force he draws  Heav'n sanctifies the Justice of his Cause  Secure he thunders thro' the thick Array  Unhurt amidst the Dangers of the Day  While  Cumberland  with early Valour proves  A Champion for that Liberty he loves  From Rank to Rank the active HERO flies  The foremost where the greatest Dangers rise  Toils o'er the Field where Numbers most engage  And heedless of his Wounds renews his Rage  So  British  Courage warms a  British  Soul  So  Gallia  trembles when our Thunders roll  So all our Sons of Liberty afar  Spread a wide Waste and push destructive War  Foul breach of Faith and violated Laws  With weighty Woes vindictive Vengeance draws  WILLIAM LORRAIN and KHEVENHULLER strike  For  Britain  's Wrongs and  Hungary  's alike  The common Cause united Force requires  The common Cause the Prince and Peasant Fires  This  Britain  has of old will still maintain  While  Lewis  trembles distant from the Plain  Bavaria  wisely changes now the Scene  Too weak a Foe for that Heroic Queen  Compell'd to Justice Feuds at length shall cease  And  France  unthank'd restore the World to Peace  An Act of Grace the Poet's Release by Mr WORSDALE  I  JOY Joy to all Mortals who got a Release  From their Prisons and Cares by the new Act of Grace  Who from Bailiffs and Spungers and Strawbeds are freed  And may shake a loose Leg now on each side the  Tweed  Derry Down Down  II  Tho' our Creditors rail we may heartily laugh  And a Health to both Houses of Parliament quaff  For the Parliament saw that those miserly Knaves  Being Slaves to their Money would make us all Slaves  Derry Down Down  III  Why should our Oppressors put poor Men in Goal  Who have not a Farthing nor Friend to be Bail  And they're paid as they ought when we're freed from our Debt  Since they had nothing to hope for and nothing they get  Derry Down Down  IV  What use is in Wealth but to purchase Content  Since Gold's but a Curse if not pleasantly spent  Then a Fig for Confinement tho' Fools make a Route  For if poor we're put in and if poor we get out  Derry Down Down  V  Adieu to all Jailors those bloodsucking Elves  Who never can lock up such Rogues as themselves  They grind and oppress us but yet I can tell  They'll be hamper'd by  Satan  the Turnkey of Hell  Derry Down Down  VI  Pettyfoggers adieu and all Quacks of the Law  Who plunder and rob us yet keep us in Awe  Who for Money sollicit each villainous thing  And grow wealthy while honester Highwaymen swing  Derry Down Down  VII  Away then we'll go for our Country to fight  And venture where Danger and Honour invite  'Tis glorious to die when with Foes we engage  But 'tis two Deaths in one for to starve in a Cage  Derry Down Down  VIII  Then God bless our King and our Parliament too  And prosper the generous Schemes they pursue  Their true  British  Spirit we plainly may see  Is to humble Oppressors and keep us all free  Derry Down Down  The Routing of the  French
