THOUGH the state of affairs in Scotland was calculated to raise the hopes of the court of St Germains the Stuart papers for this year are more curious than important The Scotish Jacobites were resolved to risk every thing to prevent the union and the consequent success of the succession in the protestant line The French had given them some expectations of support but the battles of Ramillies and Turin disconcerted all their measures The French King declared that he could spare neither men nor money at present but that he would search for a more favourable conjuncture to give them the aid they required The Tories in England were more cautious than the Jacobites of Scotland They wished for the restoration of the excluded family but they were unwilling to agree to any attempt during the life of Queen Anne They held no direct communication with the court of St Germains The agents of that court however had access as usual to Marlborough and Godolphin who seemed to give private assurances of zeal for the Pretender when they particularly the former publickly avowed their attachment to the house of Hannover while both promoted the succession in the protestant line It appears that the excluded family had turned their eyes as early as the present year towards the King of Sweden who by possessing himself of Saxony and dethroning King Augustus became in some measure the umpire of the affairs of Europe  Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters continued  Lord Caryll's Letters vol v fol Scotch College February  "THIS is to let you know that your cousin Wisely the King is very well pleased with the care you take to preserve her right in reversion upon her kinswoman's Queen Anne's death and she very well approves of the method you propose of consulting with Mr Goulston Godolphin concerning what is best to be done in it considering all present circumstances without doubt that lawyer is better able than any other both to advise and to act effectually in this affair if he were willing to undertake it But of that I must doubt considering his behaviour in your cousin's former claim of right to her estate in possession however your cousin gives you full commission to act and proceed in the way you shall think best for his interest And when you have consulted the abovenamed lawyer you will be better able to take your measures and to inform your cousin how matters are likely to go  March  What you now write concerning that part of the quitrents which are lately become due to your cousin Wisely the King sufficiently shews her undoubted right to them according to law but I fear there will be many difficulties not easy to overcome that will obstruct her getting possession of them through the neglect of her trustee of which we shall know more when you have conferred with Mr Goulston Godolphin about it Your cousin's title is certainly good in law both against Young princess Anne and against that other person Hannover whose name I forgot who at present as you say puts in a claim I am glad to hear you say that those who have long since so often promised to pay Plessington's the King's debts make steps as if they did design to be honest at last though I do not find that you have had any fresh assurance from Mr Armsworth Marlborough or Mr Gilburn Godolphin who I know are full of other business at present  April  What I hear concerning Hanmer Hannover and his knight Sir Rowland Gwyne is very extraordinary and I believe will make some division in Wanley's the Whigs family of which some are for joining immediately in company with the merchant Hanmer Hannover and others of them with Mr Brag in the parliament have publicly appeared against it I also believe that those few of Kenzy's relations Tories that stood up for Hanmer Hannover have done  but little good either to Hanmer Hannover or to themselves It is very probable as you say that the two merchants Goulston Godolphin and Armsworth Marlborough have had a great hand in all this but whether with an honest intention of paying their old debts or not time must show You are much in the right not to move in the business of the quitrents lately fallen in whilst Mr Brag parliament is in town and that will come on better next term In the mean time you may have opportunity of consulting with Mr Goulston Godolphin about it and as you may find him disposed you may make a pretty near guess of the success of that and of other matters  April  I should be very glad to hear of your having had some communication with Mr Armsworth Marlborough about the old debts before his going into the country abroad but if that cannot be I hope at least that something will be said about that matter to captain Gourdon colonel Sackville of which I suppose you will have an account  June  I find that your kinsman Mr Wisely the King is very well pleased with the way in which you proceed about the recovery of that part of the quitrents lately fallen in and applying them to the payment of the debts formerly contracted As to the success of this matter much will depend upon the honesty of Mr Young's solicitor the princess of Denmark's minister Goulston Godolphin for he has in his hands wherewithall to clear that matter and therefore a seasonable application ought to be made to him  Being a person concerned in these debts though I can pretend no great skill in the law yet I should be glad these queries might be made to those that are of Wisely's Queen's council st Whether Wisely has not at present a clear title in law as it now stands to those quitrents dly And if so whether he may not make them over to some trustees for the payment of those debts by a deed that will stand good in law This I mention because I do not see at present how the title is devolved from Wisely the King to Young Queen Anne but you that are upon the place can better judge of these matters  June  In your last you gave full satisfaction to the two queries I had put to you in mine of the sixth of June so that nothing  otherwise is to be done in the business of the quitrents than according to the plan laid down by you by the advice of counsel upon the place for as you say Mr Brag parliament is a very angry gentleman naturally and his bitterness ought not to be stirred Mr Manning's the King of France affairs have gone so much backwards of late that there is little hope of his being able to lay down the sum necessary to redeem the mortgage an army for an invasion so that we must necessarily make the best of the promises given by those other merchants which you know have been such as no honest man could make and not perform when able to do so Nor is there at present any question to be made of their ability having almost all the trade in their hands so that if they fail in the performance the shame will be theirs and the loss will be ours"  Nairne's Papers vol viii t No  The Earl of Middleton to the Marquis de Torcy  He informs him of his master's abilities and application to business  June  "THE King my master applies to business now with the address of a skillful workman The dispatches for Scotland were exactly conformed to what you said to me They are all in his own hand and style as well as eight letters to individuals of the first consequence as this gives myself very great pleasure I believe you will not be displeased to know it"  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  "An account of the present state of Scotland in July "Indorsed "Mr Scot's relation"  "First An account of the standing forces now actually in the kingdom"  "THE earl of Leven commander in chief and master of the ordnance a notorious whig and Hannoverian The earl of Lothian major general such as the commander in chief but of less capacity James Maitland major general a soldier since he was a man and if his capacity is as good as his experience is long he may be a good officer He is thought to have some good inclinations and it is presumed he may be treated with  The regiment of guards without a colonel since Ramsay's death consists of companies each company men including serjeants corporals and drums is  The earl of Dalhousie first lieutenant colonel a young man with a very small estate no good manager has debts and sometimes forced to take sanctuary in the abbey of HolyroodHouse but being of a loyal family and so educated it is presumed he has good inclinations and it may be reasonably expected that the King's presence will draw him and all such to his Majesty's interest and service The other lieutenant colonel Stewart brother to the earl of Galloway is thought to have good inclinations and to my certain knowledge he was for the grand resolve The major and following officers of this regiment are reputed well affected Thomas Hamilton second major John Murray James Scott John Hamilton William SharpScottStewart captains William Murray and James Ogilvie lieutenants the first two captains and the two lieutenants I know to be so  The troop of horse guards commanded by the earl of Argyle consists of gentlemen at least should be so  The lord Forbes first lieutenant a bigotted whig little sense little estate and disloyal My lord Ballantyne the other lieutenant one of a very ordinary capacity and little or no estate at the revolution and for several years after was esteemed very loyal but having squandered a good estate and falling in with the duke of Queensberry he bought him at the price of his post Mr John Kerr the first cornet such as the captain the other Archibald Douglas was at and after the Revolution thought very loyal and is still reputed well affected but much under the influence of the duke of Queensberry I am credibly informed that many of the gentlemen of the troop are well affected  Two troops or companies of grenadiers on horseback each consisting of men ranked as guards  The earl of Crawford colonel a goodnatured man and brave has little or no estate and influenced by the earl of Arran The captains of  some words illegible  lord Cumberland oldest son to the earl of Balcarras andChrichton heir male to the late earl of Dumfries  The first is a very young gentleman that seems to promise no great things the other is thought to have some good inclinations towards the King  Major general Maitland's regiment in the garrison of Inverlochy consists as I remember of twelve companies each company men including serjeants corporals and drums  Robert Keith first lieutenant colonel I have known him from my infancy He always was before and at the Revolution very loyal but I think since that unhappy time he is much corrupted in his principles yet at the same time I judge his old imbibed loyalty is not entirely wore out but that he may be retrieved and if I am commanded or permitted I will use my best endeavours to persuade and engage him to his duty for I know he has a great friendship for me and will not deceive me The other lieutenant colonel of this regiment is Mr Patrick Ogilvie second son to the earl of Findlater who will always be such as his brother at least so long as he is chancellor Yet he has many times with great asseverations said that he never would do any thing against the King's interest Other officers of that regiment I know not but in general I am informed that some of them are well affected and it is presumed many of the common soldiers are so because most of them are Highlandmen and of consequence thought loyal  Lord Strathnaver's regiment of foot consists of companies each company men including serjeants corporals and drums is  This colonel is a very young man and his father the earl of Sutherland being of ill principles it may reasonably be presumed he is so Yet I am told by some of his relations that he is much better disposed than his father The earl of Glencairn lieutenant colonel I know is loyally inclined and I have it from most unquestionable authors that he has often said he never would do any thing against the King and as I remember he voted the grand resolution and several captains and subalterns in the regiment are reputed well affected  The laird of Grant younger his regiment is in companies and number of men the same with Strathnaver's  The colonel before he got the regiment was reputed loyal but since he had it by Argyle's procurement he is considered as much influenced  by that lord Bruce of Kennith the lieutenant colonel is reputed loyal as are several other officers in that regiment  The earl of Lothian's regiment of dragoons as I remember consists of six companies each company including serjeants corporal and drum is men  The colonel's character is already given The lieutenant colonel is son to Pollwarth now called earl of Marchmont when the late earl of Hume listed this lieutenant colonel was thought well affected and very much under the influence of Hume but what to say of him now I know not  The major of this regiment John Johnston of Westraw is reputed to have loyal inclinations being much managed that way by his very loyal lady but he is much under the influence of his chief the earl of Annandale whom few of any side must trust  The Master of Carmichael's regiment of dragoons is in troops and number of men every way the same with Lothian's  This colonel like his father my lord Carmichael now called earl Hyndford is considered as not well affected to the King's interest and his lieutenant colonelWishart far less being a bigotted whig the son of a minister of that pernicious tribe But Pollock of that ilk the major though he is something whiggishly inclined Kilmaronock tells me that he has often with great asseverations said to him that when the King comes he shall have him and his troop and this is all the loyalty I know in this regiment except one lieutenant

Finnab such as his chief Argyle  The second independent company commanded by captain William Grant generally reputed loyal  The third independent company commanded by major M  c  Kenzie reputed loyal

bred in Dumbarton's regiment and before and at the Revolution was esteemed very loyal and is still reputed to have loyal inclinations but is a little influenced by the duke of Queensberry  Major Cout the lieutenant of the company is a most bigotted whig and reputed very disloyal  The castle of Stirling is commanded by the earl of Mar governor The garrison consists of men  What to say of the governor I know not well He was much reputed to have loyal inclinations and to my certain knowledge very much courted by the earl of Arran to be brought entirely in both to the interest of the King and country and Arran once thought himself sure of him But last session of parliament when the duke of Queensberry came to Scotland he no sooner came but he drew Mar from the country party with the bait of secretary of state  The lieutenant governor is colonel John Erskine one that is supposed will always be for what the court has a mind to so long as he enjoys any tolerable good post ButShaw of Saughy lieutenant of the company is reputed to have loyal inclinations  The castle of Dumbarton is commanded by Master Archibald Campbell brother to Argyle Who is the lieutenant I know not but the garrison I think consists of men  The castle of Blackness is commanded by the earl of Buchan lately made governor and the garrison as I suppose consists of about men but who the lieutenant is I know not  The number of the whole forces in field and garrison  This account of the forces is calculated according to the establishment but cannot be reckoned effectually at the highest  "Second The officers of state are"  "E Seafield chancellor there is no lord high treasurer the duke of Queensberry privy seal the earls of Mar and Loudon secretaries of state Boyle of Killburn now called earl of Glasgow treasurer depute Cockburn of Ormiston justice clerk Murray of Philliphaugh register  The marquis of Montrose president of council not properly an officer of state  Mr James Stuart now called Sir James is advocate  Mr William Carmichael and Sir David Dalrymple solicitors"  Third "An account of the Shires  This account is greatly abridged  "  Edinburgh  THE earl of Dalhousie lieutenantcolonel of the footguards is sheriff and for the court  "The family of Winton were never stained with disloyalty The present earl is in France and the affairs of that family are under the conduct of Mr James Seaton a most loyal gentleman and brother german to the lord Kingston Lord Balmerino a very bold loyal man and of good parts is very significant in parliament and always with the country party"  Collington lord of Session in the late King's time and Lockhart of Carnwath two commissioners of parliament for the shire are  "unquestionably loyal and of the country party"  Of the other two commissioners Dundas of Arniston and Dickson of Inveresk  "the first is a whig a courtier and lord of Session and the other has been much with the country party but sometimes varies"  Scot mentions the following gentlemen in this shire as very loyal  "Seaton of Barnes Wauchop of Niddery and all his sons Sinclair of Roselin Dalmahoy of that ilk Sir James Baird Sir William Paterson Sir William Cuningham Sir James Dick Sir James Fleming and in the town of Edinburgh though the magistracy is in Whig hands the most of the merchants and tradesmen are well affected and here I cannot but remember Mr Drummond the keeper of the prison who is always kind to loyal prisoners and took no fees from them particularly from myself he would take none"  Haddington  The earls of Tweedale Roxburgh and Haddington  "all three of a stamp and as is supposed much for Hannover"  yet it is thought enemies to the union  "What to say of lord Belhaven's loyalty  I know not for he has varied in parliament as he had employment from the court"  The commissioners of parliament are Sir John Lawder of Fountainhall  "one that is thought tolerably well affected but peevish and humoursome"  Fletcher of Salton  "though he owns himself of republican principles always opposes the court with vigour speaks boldly and well and has often said to myself that he will oppose union and Hannover still as thinking both destructive to the nation"  Nisbet of Dirleton well affected Cockburn of Ormiston younger for the court  "The generality of the gentry in this shire are esteemed well affected as are many of the commons"  Alexander Egar Surgeon member for the town of Haddington is  "by many thought loyal but sometimes influenced by Tweedale because he has much of his employment from that lord and others of his kidney"  Berwick  The earl of Hume heritable sheriff about years of age  "has been loyally educated and has a loyal governor and it is not to be doubted but he will follow the example of his most loyal worthy father lately deceased"  The friends of the earls of Roxburgh and Haddington in this shire joined with Polwarth in a late electon against the earl of Hume  "which seems to be a clear indication of what is to be expected from these three"  The commissioners of parliament are Sir Robert Sinclair of Longformacus Sir Patrick Hume of Lumsden  "both reputed loyal and have always adhered to the country party"  Sir John Swinton of that Ilk  "who sometimes trims but for the most part is with the country party"  the seat of the fourth is vacant  "In this shire many both of gentry and commons are well affected and generally all are so that are not whigs either here or elsewhere in Scotland"  Roxburgh  Douglas of Cavers is sheriff and one of the commissioners for this shire He is  "entirely managed by the duke of Queensberry"  The other commissioners are Sir William Ker of Greenhead  "reputed an honest well affected man but a little influenced by his chief Roxburgh"  Eliot of Headshaw lord of Session  "who as I am well informed came in by a trick is entirely wrong"  Bennet younger of Grubet  "He was in the country party till Tweedale Roxburgh and others  of that set broke off He is now muster master and a courtier"  The gentry are well affected and the  "commons that are not whigs are here and every where inclined to follow their master"  Selkirk  Murray of Philiphaugh is heritable sheriff The commissioners are Mr John Murray advocate and Mr John Pringle Staining  "The first is entirely governed by his brother Philiphaugh and the other much so"  The town of Selkirk is represented by Robert Scot  "As I remember he trims but the town I know is generally well affected"  Peebles  Scot did not remember who is sheriff for this shire  "The commissioners"  says he  "are Horseburgh of that Ilk and Morison of Prestongrange the first is reputed loyal and he prefessed so to myself the other is a weak but rich man expecting a patent of honour and entirely managed by Queensberry"  The earl of Traquair is  "a worthy honest man and of most unquestionable loyalty and so is Sir David Murray of Stanhope Most of the gentry are loyal The commissioner for the town of Peebles Robert Shiels is for the court"  Lanerk  Scot did not remember the sheriff of this county  "The commissioners for it are Bailey of Lamington Hamilton of Aikenhead Sinclair of Stevenstown younger these three are of the country party and much managed by the earl of Arran but Bailey of Jerviswood has entirely left that party and is every way wrong The commons of this country are generally whiggish and consequently not well affected But I am informed a good many of the gentry are well inclined"  Dumfries  He was uncertain who was sheriff  "The commissioners are Sir John Johnston of Westerhall led both by employment and the earl of Anandale Sharp of Hodham who professes loyalty but is entirely led by the duke of Queensberry so is Douglas of Dornock but Ferguson of Isle the fourth commissioner keeps by the country party and is reputed loyal and I heard him lately say he would be against the union and Hannover The common people are generally whiggish but a good  number of the gentry are well affected The earl of Nethsdale is a man of undoubted loyalty much loved and respected"  Wigton  "I know not if the earl of Wigton be sheriff of this shire but I am persuaded he is and will always prove loyal"  The commissioners are Mr John Stuart of Sorby brother to the earl of Galloway and Mr Stuart of Castle Stuart  Kirkcudbright  SirAgnew is heritable sheriff of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright  "and by many reputed well affected and I have heard him express himself so"  The commissioners are Maxwell of Cardines  "a rank whig and Hannoverian"  M  c  Kee of Palgowan to my knowledge is loyal and honest and generally known in that country to be so which is an evidence that most of the gentry there are well affected The town of Kirkcudbright is represented by Andrew Hume son to Polwarth  "both father and son Hannoverian"  The viscount Kenmure  "is of most undoubted loyalty having never taken the oaths"  Air  "If the earl of Eglington is not sheriff of this shire I know not who is But I am sure his lordship professes much loyalty and have often heard him do so The commissioners are Breslan younger of Bishoptown a loyal honest man and a close adherer to the country party Cathcart of Carleton sometimes court but for the most part country party Mr Francis Montgomery always with the court Many of the gentry are well affected but the commons generally whigs For the town of Air John Muir an engrained whig is commissioner and the most of the town are said to be like him"  Dumbarton  Mr Scot did not know the sheriff nor was he well acquainted in the county But he concluded that the gentry were loyal  "because they have chosen two gentlemen to represent them that are notourly known to be most loyal Sir William Cochrane of Kilmaronock and Sir Humphry Colquhoun of Luss constant adherers to the country party The town is represented by a noted courtier Mr Smollett"  Bute  "The Stuart of Bute now called earl of Bute is heritable sheriff reputed well affected and so is Stuart ofone of the commissioners But Stuart of Tillicutry the other commissioner is for the most with the court and much influenced by Stair and the president of the Session For the town of Rothsay Mr Dougal Stuart advocate brother to Bute is commissioner He is loyal active and bold speaks well in parliament and though he is sheriff depute of Edinburgh he closely adheres to the country party"  Renfrew  Scot did not know who was sheriff but he was convinced that the earl of Dundonald and the lord Semple were loyal and he hoped that the marquis of Montrose who had then great interest in Renfrew as well as in Dunbartonshire  "whatever mistakes his lordship has committed will in the main prove for the King's interest The gentry in this shire are generally reputed loyal but the commons most partly whiggish"  Mr Colin Campbell member for the town of Renfrew was  "reputed to have loyal inclinations but thought to be a little overawed and influenced by his chief Argyle"  The commissioners for the shire were Sir John Houston of that ilk Stuart younger of Blackhall and Pollock of that ilk  "The first are to my knowledge well affected but Pollock is entirely courtier"  Linlithgow  The sheriff uncertain  "The commissioners are Sharp of Houston and Mr John Montgomery both of the country party The gentry are generally well affected and many of the commons are so But the town is represented by a most bigotted whig Stuart of Purdiven"  Stirling  "The earl of Linlithgow as I suppose is sheriff of this shire He is to my certain knowledge loyal and was from his infancy educated under the government of a most loyal mother sister to the late marquis of Montrose The viscount of Kilsyth is loyal so is lord Forrester Graham of Killairn Graham of Bucklyvie all eminently loyal and constant to the country party The loyal gentry that I know in this shire are Mr Charles Maitland brother to the earl of Lauderdale Stirling  of Kier Seaton of Touch Murray of Polmeas But I am well informed that most part of the gentry and many of the commons are well affected The town of Stirling for the most part is whiggish at least the magistracy is so The commissioner for this town is colonel John Erskine brother to the late laird of Alloa and is a thoroughpaced courtier"  Perth    "I think the marquis of Athol is sheriff and it is hoped his lordship is or will be right and to my certain knowledge many of the King's friends are using their utmost endeavours to bring him entirely into the King's interest The lord Drummond is of most unquestionable loyalty as is his brother lord John and all the gentlemen of that name that I know in this shire or elsewhere are very loyal The viscount Stormont is of undoubted loyalty The lord Nairn is of undoubted loyalty not having taken the oaths to the princess Anne and not only as I am certainly informed given good advice to his brother the marquis of Athol but advised and assisted the lord Stormont and others how to manage the marquis in order to bring him heartily and entirely to the King's interest and service"  Scot mentions the following gentlemen as loyal in this shire and gives several reasons for his opinion of them Drummond of Logic and his brother Drummond of Blair and his sons Drummond of and his brother Mr David Drummond of advocate Mr James Graham advocate  "a son of the loyal family of Inchbrakie"  Murray of Abercairny and his brother Lindsay of Evelyke Smith of Methven Graham of Balgowan Gray of Crechie and Mr Gray of Crechie and his son now master of Gray and Sir Patrick Trepland  Fife  "The earl of Rothes as I think is sheriff of this shire and it is known to every body that knows any thing of the transactions of Scotland that he has very much lost his esteem and interest among the gentry of Fife ever since he left the country party The earl of Murray is of undoubted loyalty as is his brother and presumptive heir as having never taken the oaths and my lord Sinclair is eminently loyal having never taken the oaths and all his children that are men are loyal and Sir William Bruce colonel Balfour of Ferny Scot  of Scotstarvit Sir John Preston Carstairs of Kinneucher Stuart of Dunaven and Malcom of Grange are all very loyal never having taken the oaths"  The members of parliament were Anstruther of that ilk lord of Session Beaton of Balfour Balfour of Dunbog and Douglas of Strenry Scot was uncertain about the principles of the first and last as their conduct in parliament frequently varied but he was convinced that the second and third were well affected as they adhered closely to the country party  "Sir John Malcom and Malcom of Bolbodie I know to be loyal and the lord Lyon is generally so reputed for the earl of Balcarras I can say little for him but I know the earl of Kelly has loyal inclinations but is frequently kept out of parliament by the influence of his lady and her father Balcarras the lord Colville is thought well affected and is a close adherer to the country party for the rest of the noblemen in Fife I can say nothing for them But the far greatest part of the gentry in this shire are reputed well affected as are all such of the commons as are not under the direction and influence of presbyterian ministers The members of parliament for the towns in Fife are Watson of Aderny for St Andrews David Christie for Dysart Sir Jo Anstruther younger of that ilk for Anstruther Easter such as his father Sir John Erskine of Alloa for Bruntisland James Spittell of Lenchat influenced by Tweedale and Yester is for Inverkeithen captain Ossat a seaman for Kirkaldyof Reedie younger for Kinghorn much if not entirely under the influence of the earl of Leven Bruce of for Coupar entirely devoted to Rothes Sir Peter

for Kilrenny all those members for the towns in Fife except such as are above distinguished are generally believed to be honest men well affected to the King's interest and I know most of them to be so and all of them are thought adherers to the country party"  Forfar  "The earl of Strathmore is Sheriff and is of undoubted loyalty The earl of Airly is loyal as are the most of his name every where  The earl of Southesk is loyally educated and to my knowledge most zealous that way and it is hoped the earl of Northesk's inclinations are right Though he has sometimes varied in parliament I am sure he was for the grand resolve The lord Kinnaird is very loyal"  "The members of parliament for this shire are Lyon of Achterhouse Carnegie of Finhaven Haliburton of Pitcur and Graham of Fintray all four loyal but the first and last most remarkably so"  The loyal gentlemen in this county are  "Lindsay of Edsdale and his brother Forthringham of Powrie elder and younger Seaton of Old Bar Ramsay of Bamff Graham of Duntroune he that represents Dundee Lyon of Cossens Lyon of Carse Lyon of Ongle The town of Forfar is represented by Mr John Lyon an honest loyal man Brechin is represented by Alexander Millison so loyal and honest that no act could yet prevail with him to give the court one single vote even though he is very poor Hutcheson for the town of Aberbrothick is reputed loyal and Scot of Logie for the town of Montrose though he was the first that left the country party upon the temptation of the master of works place he always did and still does pretend much loyalty and has often sworn to myself that he never will do any thing against the King's interest  "In short this shire is so entirely loyal that there is scarce any in it of birth breeding or estate but what is so and so are all the commons some few Whigs excepted most if not all in the town of Dundee but now the magistracy of that town is out of their hands which was chiefly promoted managed and effectuated by Fintray and captain Yeaman a substantial merchant lately come from the West Indies and has the reputation of a loyal honest man"  Kincardineshire commonly called Mearns  "The earl Marshal heritable sheriff of unquestionable loyalty loved and respected has great interest in elections for parliament and on a good occasion will be much followed both by the gentry and commons The viscount of Arbuthnot is loyal and has often professed so to myself The family of Halkertown were always loyal but this lord is mad The gentry and commons of this shire are exactly so as in Angus Such of them as I personally know and am particularly acquainted with are Sir David Ramsay of Balmain commissioner for the shire who is loyal and keeps steady with the country party Sir Thomas Burnet of Leys  the other commissioner though he was very far wrong at the Revolution and sometimes varies in parliament he has for these three last sessions been for the most with the country party particularly for the grand resolves and spoke boldly against the Hannover succession when proposed by Polwarth and told myself a week or two before I came from Scotland that he would to the utmost of his power oppose the union  The gentlemen in this shire that I am familiarly acquainted with and know to be loyal are Bannerman of Elsick Falconer of Newton Falconer of Glenfarquar Middleton of Balbegno Burnet of Glenbervie Scot of Brothertown Scot of Benholm Scot of Comiestown Barclay of Johnston Barclay of Bomakinan and Douglas of Arthrose son to bishop Douglas  Aberdeenshire  "The earl of Errol lord high constable of Scotland is of most unquestionable loyalty The earl of Aberdeen is reputed loyal and my lord Haddo lately to myself expressed much loyalty The members of parliament for this shire are Udny of that ilk More of Stoneywood Gordon of Pitlurg and Seaton of Pitmeddan younger all four I am informed were chosen as loyal honest men which is a good evidence of the loyalty of the barons there as it is in many other shires I am well informed by many of the King's friends that most or all the gentry are wellaffected to the King's interest my lord Forbes and some of his name excepted who are rank Whigs and few of that stamp are any where wellaffected"  Inverness  Scot owns he knew little about this shire  "He was acquainted"  he says  "with the commissioners Grant elder and younger The first always adhered to the countryparty and to my certain knowledge very warmly opposed the Hannover succession when proposed by Polwarth His son was last session courtier"  Nairn  Scot knew little about this shire but he heard  "that the generality are wellaffected The members of parliament are Rose of Kilravock and Forbes of Culloden The first is reputed loyal and for the most part with the countryparty the other commonly with the court"  Cromarty  Scot knew only by common report  "that in this as in all the northern shires all ranks of people are generally wellaffected to the King's interest The lord Tarbat has changed so often and trimmed so much that I do not know what to say of him The members of parliament for this shire are Mackenzie of Cromarty and Macleod of Cathbole both much under the influence of Tarbat but frequently with the countryparty"  Argyle  "For this shire I can say little about it but that it is represented by Campbell of Auchenbreck Campbell of Arkinglas and Campbell of Mamore all these are and will be as their chief Argyle is and so will Mr Charles Campbell commissioner for the town of Campbeltown"  Bamff  "In this shire all ranks of people are generally believed and reputed to be loyal Ogilvie of Boyne younger is the commissioner for it and is reputed and very much pretends to be loyal He has sometimes varied in parliament but last session he closely adhered to the countryparty His colleague Duff is dead Lord Salton is loyal and though the lord Fraser has a post in the army he is thought to be loyal and the loyal lord Duffus is dead and his son is with an English squadron in the West Indies"  Sutherland  "This shire is of a very small compass and being as I am informed only two or three barons in it The earl of Sutherland's vassals are privileged by an express act of parliament to elect commissioners contrary to the general rule of law and standard of the nation So this earl must always rule the election as he thinks fit The present commissioners are Gordon of Gavity supposed to have inclinations to loyalty but often varies in parliament The other commissioner Sutherland of Kinnald younger is in prison for debt"  Caithness  "This shire as both commissioners of it informed me is entirely loyal Sinclair of Stempster is one commissioner Sir Gregory Sinclair of Clyth the other commissioner died before I came from Scotland  and none in his place that I know as yet elected but it is not to be doubted but an honest loyal man will be chosen The earl of Caithness is very loyal but it is thought will not come to parliament because he has no inclination to take the oaths"  Elgin  "I cannot say much about this shire but that it is reputed as the other northern shires are well affected It is represented by Brodie of that ilk who is old and infirm and has not been in parliament for the two sessions past The other commissioner is M  c  Kenzie of Inch Couter a loyal honest man and stands firm with the countryparty"  Orkney  "The stewartry of Orkney is believed and reputed to be very loyal The commissioners for it are Sir Archibald Stuart of Burray and Douglas younger of Eagleshaw both reputed loyal but much influenced by the duke of Queensberry yet voted the grand resolves and as I am well informed have often declared they will never do any thing against the King's interest"  Clackmannan  "This is very small consisting of three four or five barons has at present only one commissioner Stuart of who is reputed loyal and is of the countryparty"  Ross  "This shire is like the other northern ones believed and reputed to be loyal The commissioners for it are M  c  Kenzie of Scatwell and M  c  Kenzie of Gerloch both reputed loyal but much influenced by the lord Tarbat"  Kinross  "This is a very little shire containing very little more than the estate of Kinross and a little town of that name Mr Bruce younger of Kinross is commissioner for it I know not what to say of his loyalty but I can with confidence say that his father Sir William always was and still is a very loyal honest man"  "I do not pretend to give a plain distinct particular or positive account of the Highland clans but in general according to the last information I have had I think they may be capable to raise about eight  thousand men I mean such as are well affected for Argyle and all his followers are considered as otherwise disposed"  "The duke of Gordon is of so known and undoubted loyalty that I shall not presume to say any thing about his Grace only in general as he is one of the most powerful of the clans he has this advantage that having many gentlemen of note of his name and abundance of gentry in the low country his vassals he is capable to bring a good number of horse to the field which few or none of the clans but his Grace can do"  "May it please your Majesty thus to the best of my judgment and knowledge in the preceding pages I have given your Majesty a true sincere and faithful account of the present state of Scotland and I am fully persuaded that the far greatest part of the nation is well affected to your Majesty's interest and I know none that are ill affected but that pernicious rebellious crew the presbyterian ministers and such as are entirely under their direction and influence which are for the most part the common people for in the western and most Whiggish shires a great many of the chief gentry are well affected and as I am informed by the viscount of Kenmure those in Galloway commonly called Cameronians are generally for your Majesty and every body knows that all the northern shires nobility gentry and commons are well affected"  Lord Caryll's Letters vol v fol Scotch College  Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters continued  July  "I Find that of late you have not had much communication with your old acquaintance Mr Goulston Godolphin when you meet him next I shall be glad to know in what temper you find him"  August  In the former letter you tell me that the business of the quitrents is still depending without any great prospect of your reaping much advantage from them and that also the pretensions of the creditors concerning your cousin Wiseley's the King's debts had yet received no answer but that you intended a visit to Mr Goulston Godolphin to try whether by his means you could procure a good dispatch in either or both these matters you also intended at the same  time and by the same means to try to do a kindness to your friend Wilson Middleton in procuring a pass for his young kinsman which seemed otherwise to be very difficult to be obtained  Now I am very glad to find by your last letter of the th that you have met with Mr Goulston Godolphin and found him in very good humour and that which pleased me most is that he seemed to be affected with the good news of your cousin Wiseley's the King's better health which by other rumours had been contradicted As for what passed between you in regard to the quitrents I am glad at heart that he is gone so far in it as to take from you an abstract of the title and an account of the adversaries pretensions to consider what may be done in it I find Mr Jones Middleton is much beholding to him for his kind expressions in his behalf and will be more so when by his means leave is obtained for Jones Middleton his young kinsman I hope the kindness shewn to Mr Jones Middleton is upon account of the near relation he has to your cousin Wiseley the King upon which head I should most delight in it  The gentleman mentioned in the following letter is probably captain Stratton who was appointed by unanimous choice of the Jacobites in Scotland and particularly by the duke of Hamilton to go to France  Nairne's Papers vol viii to No  "The Earl of Middleton to the Marquis de Torcy"  The Scots are determined to oppose the unionThey demand assistance from France  Translation  September  "A Gentleman sent to my master the King of England by his friends in Scotland is arrived at this place and his Majesty has commanded me to explain to you his commission in order that the King may be informed of it"  "They make no new proposals referring themselves to and adhering to those which they formerly made But they hope that after the enemy's armies shall retire the King will take advantage of that opportunity to send them succours under the command of their own King whose presence appears to them very necessary for animating the people confounding his enemies and deciding when opinions differ"  "Having received no news from this country since the misfortunes that happened to them they considered themselves in duty bound to assure the King their master that their zeal was not shaken nor their courage damped by them but that they would make all their efforts to reject the union and did not doubt to succeed providing the prevailing party in England did not send money to gain voices in parliament and that even this though it should happen should not break off the project of the enterprise because those who disapprove of the union will be piqued at it and be reduced to the necessity of having recourse to force as the means of preventing the effect of an act of parliament and of delivering themselves from the tyranny with which they see they are threatened but that without the succours they demand they will not be able to do any thing and there will be reason to fear that some through despair will abandon the design in order to protect themselves from the persecutions which they have endured with a constancy that can never be sufficiently commended"  Lord Caryll's Letters vol v fol Scotch College Sept  Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters continued  "I Also thanked you in a former letter for your so seasonably taking occasion of your obliging your friend Wilson Middleton at your meeting with Mr Goulston Godolphin in procuring his assistance in behalf of the young gentleman traveller  Nairne's papers D N vol ii fol No  He probably means John lord Clermont son to the earl of Middleton There is a copy in Nairne's hand of a procuration from lord Clermont to the earl of Strathmore dated in the month of November this year whereby he impowers him to manage an estate in Scotland It appears to have been a secret and  bona fide  transaction  which I hope may give him countenance to appear in the world"  "I doubt not but you will drive the nail as far as it will go in the business of the quitrents formerly mentioned that they may be applied to the payment of the debts which would be of great ease and satisfaction to your cousin Wisely the King"  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  A Memorial shewing that it is the interest of the King of Sweden to hinder the Hannoverian succession  Carried to Versailles the d September  Translation  "IT is unnecessary to prove the utility of having a free communication between separate dominions Now the duke of Hannover who will have none with his territories in Germany when he is master of England will think himself obliged and even under a necessity to find this advantage of a communication and to employ all sorts of means to establish it and his conscience will be no obstacle to him as he will justly think that he will have as much right to any other country as he has to England  As a bridge of boats is thrown over rivers vessels are employed for the same purpose at sea and in order to employ them to keep up a communication between England and the territories of Hannover the duke of Hannover must have a maritime province to join his dominions and he will find none but that of Bremen  The same reasons which will induce the family of Hannover to seize on the country of Bremen should alarm the King of Denmark for the safety of Holstein and Oldenburgh without which that family will not be master of the Elbe and the Weser not to mention the ancient enmity between these two powers which appeared on all occasions and lately at the treaty of Travendal Any regard he may have had for the present establishment in England should have ceased at the death of the prince his uncle without children and now instead of establishing an enemy it depends entirely upon him to reestablish the King of England his near relation and thereby engage him still more strongly from a principle of gratitude and from ties of blood to be invariably in his interest  The elector of Brandenbugh likewise may allow himself to be carried away by the hopes of having for his share Pomerania to which he pretends a right of succession as well as conveniency and a powerful addition to support his royalty  The elector of Saxony will require no other motive for entering into this plan but revenge and an irreconcilable hatred  It is not to be doubted but the King of Sweden will be persuaded that these things merit serious reflections and that he will find no other means so effectual for preventing the calamities with which he is threatened as to employ all his force to reestablish the King of England and there is reason to hope that he will make no difficulty of contributing to this when he will see that prudence justice and glory concur in it  The means of executing so great and so noble an enterprise will be explained when the King of Sweden chooses to enter into a treaty"  Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters continued  Nov  "I Shall be glad to hear what the result will be of your next conference with Mr Goulston Godolphin when you can obtain it as to the several matters which have been proposed to him which I fear will end only as you say in procrastination if not in a flat denial as to the debts and quitrents"  Dec  "You may remember that Mr Armsworth Marlborough once told you that there should be no money lent to Norly the Scots to carry on the lawsuit against Plessington the King in the behalf of Hanmer Hannover Pray tell me in your next whether you think that gentleman has been as good as his word In the mean time I must own myself much obliged to Mr Goulston Godolphin for his protection offered to our young traveller I am of your opinion that should the match union be concluded between Norly Scotland and Wheatly England it would in process of time breed divisions in and between the two families"  HANNOVER PAPERS    THE Whigs by intimidating Godolphin had procured the influence of government in the elections for members of the new parliament which met for the first time on the twentyfifth of October Finding themselves the majority John Smith one of their own party was chosen speaker of the house of commons notwithstanding the vehement opposition of the Tories William Cowper a man of heavy and confused parts but who was attached to the same principles was made by their influence keeper of the great seal and in general the whole current of preferment ran through the same channel The Tories vexed at the loss of their influence acted a part which exhibited a curious specimen of that glaring inconsistency of conduct into which the spirit of party has too often betrayed mankind To harass their political opponents they endeavoured to take possession of their ground and though they were supposed to be enemies to the succession of the house of Hannover the lord Haversham as the mouth of the party moved in the house of lords for an address to the Queen to invite the princess Sophia into England The motion was rejected by the Whigs who then possessed the whole influence of government There were however brought in two bills which were deemed a great security to the protestant succession the first appointing a regency on the event of the Queen's death and the second for naturalizing the princess Sophia and the issue of her body being protestants  The opposition of the Whigs to the invitation to the princess Sophia having raised suspicions against their attachment to the house of Hannover the party endeavoured to take to themselves the whole merit of the  securities in savour of the succession which had passed in the present session of parliament The lord Halifax one of their number was sent with the acts of regency and naturalization to Hannover and he carried along with him letters from all the leaders of the Whigs expressive of their sincere attachment to the succession of the electoral family The increase in the correspondence with Hannover together with the zeal expressed in the letters form a kind of proof that the succession of the princess Sophia and her posterity began then for the first time to acquire a degree of certainty The Queen perhaps justly was suspected of having no intentions of that kind and her minister the lord Godolphin had been uniformly in the interest of the exiled family though by a happy timidity he at last in a manner ensured success to their rivals He however was so true to his principles that though he aided with all the weight of government the acts of regency and naturalization he never took merit to himself from that circumstance nor entered into any correspondence with the house of Hannover The principal events connected with the correspondence of this year are the complimentary embassy of the lord Halifax the treaty guaranteeing the protestant succession concluded with the States General the treaty of Union then carrying on between the two kingdoms the battle of Ramillies the subsequent conquest of Flanders the victory before Turin and the evacuation of Italy by the house of Bourbon  Copy in an unknown hand Hannover Papers vol marked Princes No  The Elector to the Duke of Marlborough

of the project which you got approved of at the Hague for putting King Charles and prince Eugene in a condition to act offensively the next campaign It is certain that one cannot imagine any thing more advantageous to the common cause and that the prudence with which you have formed this project joined to the care which yon have taken to bring it to a happy  conclusion has added not a little to the great obligations which the public owes you already and to the glory of the Queen who continues to give such convincing proofs of her good intentions  "With regard to the affair of Lubec you are too well informed not to see that it would be as much my interest as the interest of the rest of the allies to see it terminated amicably by an accommodation But if this cannot be soon done in a manner with which the administration may be satisfied I leave you to judge if it will be possible to control the King of Sweden and if I can dispense with fulfilling the engagements into which I entered personally concerning the bishopric of Lubec and those to which the guarantee of the treaty of Travendahl binds me Being joined in this guarantee with her Majesty and with Holland I doubt not but in that case they will concur with me in making the house of Gottorp sensible of its good effects in an efficacious manner"  "You have no doubt been informed already that the troops have been withdrawn by both parties from the city of Eutin and from the whole bishopric and that the Danes are returned home after having dislodged the troops of the administrator so that the only thing to be done now is to support that prince in the civil possession and in the administration of the bishopric under the guarantee of the same powers who are guarantees of the treaty of Travendahl I hope that her Majesty will not only contribute to this but also by her influence determine the States General to join her in so salutary an undertaking I beseech you Sir to be so good as to give all your attentions to this as the affair is of importance enough to deserve them and to be persuaded that I shall never neglect an opportunity of showing you how much I am  My Lord  Your affectionate servant

shall never have any thing more at heart than to conform myself to your intentions and to give you proofs of my zeal for the common cause It was with very great satisfaction I was informed by Mr Howe of your Majesty's favourable sentiments for the interests of the house of Gottorp and the instructions you was pleased to send on that affair to your minister at the Hague I shall concur on my part with pleasure in the expedients which without prejudice to the incontestible rights of that house may terminate amicably the differences now subsisting I shall even employ myself with all possible ardour to reconcile the King of Sweden and the administrator to them I wrote yesterday to the latter to dispose him to this and to represent to him that it is very just to give your Majesty and the States the time which is necessary for engaging Denmark to resolve to give their consent that the administrator may be re established in the possession of the bishopric without which I assure your Majesty it will be no ways possible to control the King of Sweden I doubt not but your Majesty by your great influence at the Imperial court will prevail with the Emperor to concur with you and with the states in engaging Denmark to accept of such a reasonable expedient This in my opinion is the only means of obtaining the end which your Majesty has in view mine shall always be to give you proofs

state which gives room to believe that it will have no consequence hurtful to the interests of the common cause"  "It is very disagreeable that the prince of Baden should be silent when he ought to concert with you the operations of a campaign which  is already so near It is to be hoped that the imperial court without delay will take in that respect the necessary measures with her Majesty and with the states Whatever may be the result of this you may assure yourself that I shall give to lieutenant general Bulau the orders which you desire and that the troops which I have in the Queen's pay will join your army whether it acts in Brabant or in any part whatever of the empire And I am inclined to hope at the same time that if the Statesgeneral have troops in the army which you shall command you will obtain from them to have those which I have in their service"  "I do myself a very sensible pleasure in giving on this as on every other occasion marks of the strong desire I have to

using the French language by saying  "  poore Cardnall is sicke  "    He endeavours to convince him of the importance of the acts passed in the last session of Parliament  Translation  March  "THE dutchess of Marlborough shewed me a letter she received from Mrs Howe which appears to me to contain an affair of so much consequence that I think myself obliged as a good Englishman and as a faithful servant to your Electoral Highness to communicate it to you It contains that all that has been done in England this winter for establishing the protestant succession and for testifying respect and attentions to your electoral family is in the opinion of the electress of so little consequence that she considers it at most as a mere compliment and that for that reason it will be more agreeable to her that the acts of parliament may be sent to Hannover without any ceremony and that the garter which the Queen has given to the electoral prince may be sent merely by a herald"  "These sentiments concerning what hath been done here are altogether different from those which every one in England who has ever shewn  any zeal for the protestant succession entertains of it It is for this reason I am not able to reflect upon this affair without a great deal of uneasiness The parliament have redressed several very essential defects in the laws which regarded a protestant succession They have provided against all accidents which human prudence could foresee and they have put the government in the time of the successor on the same footing which it is at present during the reign of the Queen These things are considered here as affairs of the last importance and as the most real and essential marks that could be given of a true zeal for the protestant succession"  "With regard to the act of naturalization of the electoral family it has been declared to be absolutely necessary by the unanimous opinion of all the judges who are the best guides in an affair of that nature With regard to the proposal of inviting the electress over to England immediately when it is considered by what fort of men it was made in what manner and at what time there was reason to hope that a proposal of that nature would not be better received by the electress than it has been in England There is no one so capable of judging of all this affair as your electoral Highness and you only can set it before the electress in the proper light This is what I beseech you to be pleased to do for the good of England and of the protestant succession I cannot make a better excuse for the liberty I have taken

have all my lifetime for her sacred person with a grateful acknowledgment of the affection which her Majesty has been so good as to express for me and for my family It would be mistaking me entirely

Original Hannover Papers vol marked Princes No  Cowper the lordkeeper to the Elector  "May it please your Electoral Highness  London  April  WHEN I was first by her Majesty's great goodness raised to the station I am now in I could not persuade myself that a subject of so little importance would have then excused my presumption in troubling your electoral highness in this manner upon that occasion though with the sincerest assurances that my heart should ever continue most firmly devoted to the service of your E H and your E H serene house But now since I hope it is allowable for me to express to your E H the very great satisfaction I have with every good Englishman received from the effectual securities lately provided by the parliament for the protestant succession to the crown of England I beg leave humbly to present to your E H at the same time his most faithful profession of a most ardent zeal for your E H prosperity and promise never to neglect any thing in my little power that may possibly conduce to it being fully persuaded it is impossible to be in the true interest of England and not to be a fast friend to that succession which the sense of the kingdom hath so often declared to be its only defence from the most deplorable condition a people can be reduced to I was one of those who have had the honour for a long time past constantly to have adhered to that opinion for excluding a Romish successor even while it was unfashionable and decried by those that were in authority and therefore that the same persons should now continue firm to the same when it is owned by the legislative authority and the general bent of the people can admit I think of no question This I chose to mention as an evidence of my sincerity in what I profess rather than multiply expressions which are in every one's power to make not that I am at all apprehensive of those endeavours which have been used to render your E H and your E H serene house disgusted with those who have the truest concern for your service since it is impossible that so excellent a judgment as that of your E H should ever prefer the surprizing starts of a sudden unaccountable zeal contrary to known principles affected merely for popularity and shewing itself in one particular only while all other means tending to the same are neglected to a steady uninterrupted  and uniform course of acting for the protestant succession and flowing from principles that were owned when most discountenanced But these endeavours in me to give your E H any satisfaction of this kind are perfectly unnecessary since my lord Halifax who is so able and thoroughly versed in all the affairs of this kingdom and so acquainted with the inclinations and practices of all men in business here is to be for some time in your E

justifies the proceedings of the last session of parliament particularly the bill of naturalization  SIR  London  April  "THE hopes of having my letter presented to your Electoral Highness by my lord Halifax has encouraged me to the presumption of writing I could not hope for a more favourable opportunity of making this humble tender of my duty than by the hands of one who has so eminently distinguished himself upon all occasions for the settling and establishing the succession of the crown of England in your most serene family and who will be a witness above exception of my conduct in every part of that affair I confess I always depended upon it that my public behaviour should be an abundant testimony for me as to my zeal to the protestant succession and for promoting the war in order to reduce the power of France which I take to be the most effectual security to that succession  It is with infinite satisfaction we hear your Electoral Highness has been pleased to approve the measures taken in our parliament this last winter My lord Halifax is able to give so perfect an account of every thing that has been done and of the several means used to bring them all to bear that I shall not pretend to enter further into that matter than by saying  I hope it will appear that nothing is now wanting to the establishment of the succession that can be done by the provision of laws and that the administration of the government when the succession shall take place will be upon the same foot that it is now in the Queen's reign  It might have a strange appearance that they who by a long and steady series of acting had shown themselves beyond a possibility of dispute the assertors of the succession in the person of her Electoral Highness the princess Sophia should in the least hesitate to agree to a proposition that it was necessary to have the next presumptive heir to the crown to reside in England but I beg leave to suggest to your Electoral Highness's consideration that if this had been allowed for a rule it might possibly in a little time have pressed very inconvenient upon your Electoral Highness It was not to be imagined you would leave dominions where you were sovereign to reside in England before you were our king and yet there would have been an inconveniency in rejecting an invitation of that nature when the kingdom had before declared such a residence to be necessary But the manner of making this proposal was above all other things the strongest objection to it The speech with which it was introduced is in print and so cannot be misrepresented The turn of it was to shew first that we could go on no farther with the Dutch which was in effect to say we must make peace and next to say the Queen's administration was hardly sufficient to help us in peace at home unless the next heir came over The Queen was present at this discourse and no one can judge so well as your E H whether this was a compliment proper to engage her Majesty to enter willingly into the invitation and if it had been assented to with reluctance whether it might not have given rise to unkindnesses that might in the end have proved very fatal  They who were afraid of entering into such an invitation especially coming as it did from those who never till then shewed any concern for the protestant succession thought it proper to lay hold of that favourable conjuncture to push in for those solid provisions which were evidently wanting and which we hope are brought to effect by the act that is to be farther carried on by the negociation entered into for engaging the allies to become guaranties of our succession and by the treaty  between the commissioners of England and Scotland for a union of the two kingdoms which seems to be the way now laid open for obtaining the declaration of the same succession in Scotland which is already effected in England I believe there is a good disposition in the commissioners on both sides I can absolutely promise for one the meanest of them that as far as my capacity and application can go nothing shall be wanting to bring this treaty to a happy issue  Having already presumed to take so great a liberty I humbly beg permission of your E H to mention another particular the act of naturalization which some have said was at least unnecessary if not a diminution to your most serene family If this be so not only all our present judges but all the lawyers of former ages have been in the wrong There are but two ways of making any persons born out of the allegiance of the crown of England capable of enjoying inheritances honours or offices in this Kingdom the one complete and perfect which is a naturalization by act of parliament the other imperfect which is by letters patent of denization That this is so cannot be better proved than by the instance of his highness prince Rupert For when K C the First intended to create him D of Cumberland to make him capable of that title it was found necessary previously to make him a denizen by the K's grant under the great seal the differences then subsisting between the King and his parliament making it impossible to procure a naturalization But the present act is attended with all possible marks of honour and respect for the Queen and nation It extends to all the posterity of her R H the princess Sophia born or hereafter to be born and wheresoever they are born which is a privilege that was never yet granted in any case till in this instance It is only from your E H's eminent goodness that I can hope for pardon for this tedious

to acquaint your R H once for all with the necessity of such an agent but since none has come I must conclude the proposal never came to your hands though sent inclosed several ways which was a confirmation of the reasonableness of it which has made me resolve to give your R H this one trouble more now at last in hopes it may have better success though inclosed for once to Mr Davenant but in

that time when you will be pleased to settle this so necessary method I shall now only say that in my conscience I believe and dare affirm myself sure that the persons in both houses who appeared for your coming over and against that bill which passed not to present it but as a security brought in the room of it did it principally for the quiet and safety of the government and more especially of the Queen's sacred person whom according to their obligations they love and reverence above all things and their next consideration was for fear that illdisposed persons should interpose between the time of such a fatal accident of our losing her and the protestant succession established and might consequently wish for that sad day in order to such their design and this was my own reason which I

forces in the Low Countries had passed the Geete at Tirlemont and encamped between that place and Leane with a design of giving us battle we did not hesitate to advance toward them placing our confidence in the blessing of heaven and the valour of our troops Sunday last we continued our march at three o'clock in the morning to gain the opening between the Mahain and the great Geete We soon understood that the enemy were likewise in march but according to the report of the general officers who were our prisoners their design was not to fight  before Monday not believing that we would venture to come to them The armies were in fight before noon and all diligence was used on both sides to arrange the troops in order of battle and to form the batteries which began to play at one And toward two o'clock we ordered the village of Ramillies which covered the right of their infantry where they had their largest battery with a great force to be attacked  The battle became hot and continued long enough with great fury but at last the enemy was obliged to give way We took their cannon and made many prisoners and having continued the fight with the same vigour the infantry as well as the cavalry until between four and five o'clock when the enemy began to withdraw we pursued them without intermission fighting them as they retired until the night was far advanced so that God has given us a complete victory We have taken fortythree pieces of cannon the pontons a great part of their baggage and at least four thousand prisoners besides their loss in the battle  We only halted two hours in the night and we began our march before day in order to draw near the Dyle of which we had determined to attempt the passage this morning at daylight but the enemy saved us that trouble having retired last night toward Brussels so that we entered Louvain and all our army passed the river without opposition The French burnt their magazines in the town but the Spaniards left theirs entire  Your E H may easily judge by this of the loss of the enemy and of the consternation in which they are We propose tomorrow to advance toward Brussels to take the advantage of this consternation and to endeavour to attack them again or to oblige them to retire further Nothing could excuse us for fatiguing the troops so much after so obstinate an engagement but the necessity of driving them to the last extremity before the Marishal de Marsin joins them which may happen in four days  Your E H will forgive me for so long an account which I am sure however will be agreeable to

good intentions are so well known and whose understanding is proof against every artifice  I agree with you my lord that it is necessary to be very much on one's guard and to be diffident of whatever

which can arise that is to say whether there are any princes of the house of Austria whether there are but princesses or whether that house shall be entirely extinct For without this precaution it may happen that in case the Emperor and King Charles the Third shall die without male descendants France may draw a pretext from thence of beginning a new war and of forming fresh pretensions to the crown of Spain  I leave you likewise to consider my lord if in order to take away a pretext from France ever ready to excite new troubles in the empire it would not be proper to stipulate with that crown the recognition of the ninth electorate"  STUART PAPERS    THOUGH Great Britain derived the benefits of the Revolution from the folly and enthusiasm of James the Second it owed the continuance of that system of government to the happy ignorance and confined policy of Lewis the Fourteenth The justness of this observation is partly established by the secret negociations of the present year The Union of the kingdoms had raised a resentment and even a degree of fury among the nobility and gentry as well as among the vulgar in Scotland that threatened the worst consequences They wanted but a show of succours from France to take up arms against England Many of the nobility and chiefs of clans were enthusiastically attached to the excluded family and they pressed with eagerness for the presence of the Pretender in Scotland were it only with a body of men sufficient to protect him against the officers of justice in the kingdom till they could join him with their vassals The French King though apprized of this state of affairs in Scotland either through want of comprehension in himself or the fortunate ignorance of foreign affairs which always prevailed in the counsels of France declined to send the demanded supplies and thus discouraged a diversion to the arms of the most powerful of the allies which in all likelihood would have procured the peace which was so necessary to his distressed subjects  To amuse however the Scots he resolved to send colonel Hooke again into their country The object of this man's expedition was to induce the malecontents to take arms without subjecting the French King to any engagements on his side When Hooke arrived in Scotland he found the malecontents distracted among themselves The duke of Hamilton who had been for many years considered as the head  of the Jacobites  and was much followed by the Presbyterians had lost the affection and confidence of both by his impenetrable conduct in parliament The two parties were equally averse to the Union and they ascribed the misfortune as they called it of that measure either to the timidity or treachery of the duke In this state of affairs it was not likely that if even France had sent the aid required the enemies of the Union could make any formidable figure in the field But the court of St Germains who perceived that there was no serious intention to favour their own cause informed their friends in Scotland that no succours were to be sent and that therefore they ought to take care of themselves The chief part of the correspondence of the present year relates to these circumstances The servants of the Pretender who had been unreasonably sanguine on many other occasions seemed to have derived no hopes either from Hooke's negociations or the intrigues of their agents in England with the duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin They however continued their intercourse with the Jacobites in Britain to preserve them in their principles and hopes for a more favourable conjuncture  Lord Caryll's Letters vol v fol Scotch College Jan  Extracts from Lord Caryll's Letters  "I Find no ground at all for the reports you mention of the merchants Manly the King and Wisely's Queen removing from the place where they have so long traded and fixing elsewhere so that I look upon such rumours whether well or ill meant to be but idle speculations I am also of your opinion that a good construction may possibly be made of Armsworth's Marlborough's intentions in the bargain which is now making between Wheatly England and Norly Scotland because it may bring on a necessity of Henly's continuing in his post for it has always been my opinion that Armsworth Marlborough without the assistance of Henly would never be able to pay his old debts But on the other hand I very much question whether at this present that merchant and his partners have such honest thoughts I am very apprehensive that he intends only to support himself in supporting Henly and little thinks of his former engagements But these matters must be left to time and to providence"  Jan  "As to what you writ concerning those two merchants Goulston Godolphin and Armsworth Marlborough they are so full of mystery in their dealings that it is hard to judge of their intentions and designs"  The Jacobites have generally and with some reason suspected that the court of France regarded no further the interest of the Pretender than only when it was subservient to their own Lewis the Fourteenth himself seems frequently to have been sincere in his professions to the excluded family His ministers however justly judging that they could have only the uncertain gratitude of the person whom they should serve for the expence and hazard of an expedition were extremely backward in making any effectual efforts for invading Britain Besides it was natural for them considering their own attachment to monarchy to suppose that they derived great advantage from having in their hands the person whom they supposed to have an hereditary right to the British crown The attempts therefore which were from time to time made for invading this island were rather intended to engage the nation in a civil war than to contribute effectually to restore the family of Stuart The languor and caution of its court increased with the misfortunes of France in the present war Happily for Britain the court of Versailles were most inattentive and negligent when they most stood in need of spirited efforts and when the state of these kingdoms were most exposed to revolution and change It was for example with great caution and reluctancy as appears from the following letters that the French ministry yielded to the vehement applications of the court of St Germains to take advantage of the violent discontents excited in Scotland in the present year by the Union between the kingdoms  Nairne's papers vol viii t No  The Earl of Middleton to Colonel Hooke  He is uncertain about the

advantage of their first fervour and to prevent the exportation of corn since without that a great part of the summer may pass in performing uncertain expeditions at sea and delays often cause

order to put them in a condition of acting which money might be brought back to you in case things were not circumstanced as one could wish  Thirdly But in case that cannot be done would it not be better not to send any warlike stores till the treaty is finished because that might alarm the enemies and give umbrage to the well affected who would fear perhaps that they had nothing further to

to write to me this morning and they have commanded me to assure you that they consent with pleasure to all that the King judges necessary to give him satisfaction concerning the affairs of Scotland and they find themselves much obliged to you for the good offices you have rendered them on this as on all other occasions on which they will always depend"  The French court resolving to send colonel Hooke to Scotland M de Chamillart gave him the following instructions which may serve at once for a specimen of the extreme ignorance of the French ministry and their insincerity in the cause of the Pretender Chamillart it seems had the weakness to suppose that the Scotish nobility would rise in arms and maintain a regular war against England He speaks with familiarity of campaigns as if the populace of Scotland had already been formed into regular armies and their leaders provided with finances to support a long series of hostilities  Nairne's Papers vol viii to No  Instructions from M de Chamillart to colonel Hooke  Translation  February  "TO be certain of making a diversion in Scotland which will embarrass the English and oblige them to bring back a considerable body of troops to England the Scotish nobility must be in a condition to assemble or men and to clothe arm equip and maintain them during the campaign i e at least six months to commence at the beginning of May  The favourable dispositions of the nobility leave no room to doubt but they will make their utmost efforts to withdraw themselves from the yoke which the English nation intends to impose upon them Before a revolution which should end in the restoration of the lawful sovereign is begun it is necessary to enter into a particular detail of the forces and means which the Scotch can employ to accomplish it and of the succours which they may promise themselves from the protection of the King who is no less interested in the success of this enterprise than his Britannic Majesty It is for these considerations that his Majesty hath judged it proper before he makes any positive promise to the Scots to send over Mr Hooke in order to acquire upon the spot a perfect knowledge of the state of things to form a well digested plan with the nobility to reduce it to writing and to get it signed by the principal men of the country giving them assurances of his Majesty's sincere desire and his dispositions to send them the succours which may be necessary for them and his Majesty recommends in a very particular manner to Mr Hooke not to engage him in expences which those he is obliged to lay out elsewhere will not allow him to support nor to give them any room to hope for more than he can furnish  The articles which are to be the principal objects of his attention are first to inform himself with certainty of the number of troops of which the army shall be composed and of the generals and other officers who are in the country to command them if they stand in need of some of those which are in France of what rank and how many the particular places where those men who voluntarily engage shall assemble and the place of general rendezvous afterwards  To know who will clothe arm and equip them if they have cloth in the country and if they are able to pay for it who will furnish fusees bayonets swords belts bandeliers and powderflasks linen stockings shoes hats and other utensils such as hatchets pickaxes and spades  If they have any artillery of what size and what quantity  If they have stocks and carriages for cannon  If they have officers of artillery cannoniers bombardiers and miners  If they have mortars bullets bombs grenades and in what quantity  If they have powder and ball whether for cannon or for muskets  What they want of these things and what they demand as absolutely necessary for them acquainting them that it is not their interest to demand too much  It will not be sufficient to be informed with certainty that they are able to assemble a considerable army it likewise is necessary to know further the means by which the nobility intend to subsist them while they are in the field and by which they can form magazines and assemble waggons to follow the army wherever the generals think it may be proper to order it to march  The same inquiry must be made about the equipage for the artillery for the use of which it will be necessary to have a certain number of horses in proportion to the train which they think they should bring into the field  They must not persuade themselves that the mere good will of the nobility and the blind obedience of their vassals in doing whatever they choose are sufficient to oblige them to remain too long from home when they are furnished only with bread they must have meat and spirits or at least vegetables with some other drink than water the use of which is not common in that country  It is of importance to be assured of the manner in which the grain and drink shall be furnished of the assessment which shall be made of the contingent which each nobleman shall contribute in grain drink and other provisions of the number of men they will give and if they shall be clothed armed and equipped In short to enter into such an exact  detail that nothing will remain to be done but to take a final resolution concerning the project which Mr Hooke shall form in order to secure its success

the experience and good sense of Mr Hooke will suggest to him"  M de Chamillart discovers in these instructions that he was ignorant of the real state of Scotland but Mr Hooke adhered strictly to some

in every thing relating to our service to seize the government and all forts and castles and to use all acts of hostility against those who shall traiterously presume to oppose our authority and to

Instructions for Colonel Hooke  " YOU are forthwith to repair to Scotland and to endeavour to meet with as many of our friends as you can to deliver to them our letters respectively by which they are to give credit to what you propose to them in our name  You are to expose to them the necessity of laying hold of this opportunity of vindicating our right and their privileges and independency which if neglected may never be retrieved  That as soon as they appear in arms and have declared for us we design to come in person to their assistance with the succours promised us by the most Christian King which cannot be obtained till they have given that evidence of their dispositions  You are to explain to them that the declaration of war you carry with you is only a summons to rise in arms reserving to bring along with us an ample declaration for pacifying the minds of our people and the false and malicious suggestions of our enemies of which we desire they would send us a draught in the mean time you may assure them of our unalterable resolution of securing to them their religion laws liberties and independency  If you find that a party is disposed to rise in arms on what pretence whatsoever without directly owning our authority you are to acquaint our friends that we allow and approve of their joining with and assisting them against our common enemy  Our commission of general is designed for the earl of Arran but in case he declines it our friends are to name another whose name is to be inserted But neither this commission nor that for levying of war either in Scotland or Ireland to be published except you find them immediately disposed to take the field though our letter to him in Ireland may be sent when it can be safely conveyed  You are to assure each

of humour will make him unfit to be applied to in your cousin Wisely's the pretender's affair at least at present and as for Mr  Armsworth Marlborough I believe he has so much business of his own upon his hands that notwithstanding all former engagements he will hardly have the leisure perhaps not the will to mind old promises  I am very glad to hear what has lately been imparted to you by some of Mr Kensy's the Tories relations that they are not now averse from having the concurrence of Mr Manning the King of France in Plessington's the King's affair for though we cannot expect to bring that cause speedily to a trial yet Kensy the Tories and his partners ought to be managed and kept in good humour In the mean time I believe he is irreconcilable with our chief adversary Wanly the Whigs and that you may perhaps make him firm to us and it is upon a like account that we may reckon to have friends in Mr Norly's Scotland family who can never pardon what our adversary Brag parliament has done against them but these are seeds which must have time to grow"  April  "As to our affair about the cause depending between Wheatly England and Manning France I believe that what Mr Armsworth Marlborough told captain Gordon is very true viz that Manning France has offered to bring the whole cause to arbitration without any salvo to your cousin's the King's interest which being so I hope there will be no mention made of it on either side but that it will be left as now it is  I am glad to find that your friend the captain has so good an opinion of Mr Gurny's Marlborough's honest intentions to pay the old debt when able As to his ability there are few people that doubt of it but as to his sincerity I find there are many who doubt of it  I perceive there are great animosities between these two merchants Kensy Tories and Wanly Whigs which may possibly break out into suits at law nor is there much more peace and quiet in Norly's Scotland family about stating their accounts Now I perceive that if they proceed to a trial at law discoveries may be made very advantageous to your cousin's interest as having been formerly joined in commerce with them  I shall be glad to hear what a second conference between our captain and Mr Armsworth Marlborough will produce which you seem to intimate"  May  "You tell me that the hasty departure of Mr Rysehoven Marlborough out of town disappointed you of speaking to him of which the loss I think is not very great for I think he would have said no more to you than he lately said to captain Gordon of paying of the old debt and than what he hath formerly so often said upon that subject without any effect But you have no reason from thence to think yourself an unprofitable servant in the concerns of your friends and to take upon yourself the faults and failings of others However it will not be amiss to receive good words as often as we can from that merchant hoping that in time whatever it may be now things may so fall out that he may have a good meaning joined to good words The same thing is to be hoped from Mr Travers Tunstal and his partners Kensy Tories though these two at present I think have more sincerity than the former in what they say whether it be out of spite on one side or out of friendship on the other What Mr Travers Tunstal has promised you of keeping his hold in his trust for your cousin Wisely is a mark of his good intentions and I hope Mr Goulston Godolphin will do the same that justice at last may take place"  Nairne's papers vol viii to No  The Earl of Middleton to M de Chamillart  Colonel

could have occupied so many regular troops commanded by mareschals of France for three years The King of Sweden always favoured by fortune during five years in Poland has been convinced that he could never finish the war without entering into Saxony and his enemy after having obtained a victory has been obliged to renounce his dignity in order to save his own patrimony  and the enemies in Germany

frontier of his kingdom farther than all his ancestors We see however that all the art of our enemies have been employed to carry the war into his dominions of this their efforts in Spain their attempts upon the Moselle their project of a descent and the invasion of the duke of Savoy for the second time are very sensible proofs  Mr Hooke has informed us of the good disposition of the Scots whose fidelity and capacity are known to you They demand their King who wishes ardently to join them If the affairs of the King are urgent here that pleads strongly for the project in Scotland If a small part of the money and of the troops which are employed here would finish the business there it would be wrong to hesitate and what would be formerly prudent and glorious becomes now absolutely

useful that can happen in his reign"  Lord Caryll's Letters vol v fol Scotch College August  Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters continued  "WHAT you write concerning Mr Travers Tunstal does not much surprise me considering his temper and the provocation given him but that to accomplish his revenge against his adversaries he should bring in Adamson and consequently Plessington the King and in a manner make a sacrifice of them who have done him no injury seems not consistent with that morality of which he has formerly made profession I am confident should Travers Tunstal gain his point in bringing Hanmer Hannover to join and cohabit with Wheatly England he will not be the man to rule the roast but that Wanly's family Whigs will be the persons most relied upon who are for him not out of spite but affection However it's not impossible but Providence may make use of these wrangles to make right take place  Sept  I am glad to hear that Mr Travers's Tunstal's designs in concert with an

prerogatives of the crown In the present year nothing happened that could give a pretence to either party to renew their correspondence The duke of Marlborough and the earl of Sunderland are the only persons of rank whose letters deserve to be inserted  The Hannover correspondence of this year regards chiefly the birth of a son to the Electoral Prince and his being created duke of Cambridge

the repeated and earnest solicitations of the court of St Germains Ascribing the flattering accounts received from Scotland to the zeal of the Jacobites in France they were unwilling to hazard either their ships or their troops upon so slender a foundation The discontents in Scotland though perhaps not magnified beyond their real bounds were represented as too great to be implicitly believed This caution on the part of France has been upon many occasions highly fortunate for Great Britain but at no period more fortunate than in the year Towards the beginning of February M de Chamillart and his brethren in office began to issue orders for an expedition from Dunkirk The Pretender when he perceived that something serious was intended in his favour resolved to acquaint his friends in Scotland of the intentions of the court of France and to give them directions to prepare themselves for an insurrection The person appointed for this service was Charles Fleming brother to the earl of Wigton The following were the instructions given him upon this occasion  Nairne's Papers vol viii to No  "Instructions to going by our order to Scotland  Given at our court at St Germains  the th day of February  and in the seventh year of our reign"  In Nairne's hand  "AS soon as you have received these our instructions you are forthwith to repair with what convenient speed you can to our ancient  kingdom of Scotland and there to address yourself to such of our friends as we have named to you but cannot safely name them here for fear of accidents  st You are to assure them that we are coming with all possible diligence to assert our right and to protect our subjects in their religion liberties and trade conform to their laws and that we bring with us a sufficient force a good sum of money arms ammunition and other provisions as was required in their memoire  dly You are likewise to assure them that upon our being put in possession of the throne by their assistance our dearest brother the most Christian King will restore the Scots to their ancient privileges in France and will also use his endeavours to have them included in all treaties of peace  dly You are to give our positive orders to a select number of the nobility and gentry to seize suspected persons with their horses arms and other provisions for war and to tell them that we do hereby allow and authorize them to grant warrants to others for the same effect when they judge the proper time to do it without discovering the secret which we recommend to them above all things  thly You are to tell those who are trusted that upon the first appearance of the fleet that brings us or upon the first account they have of our landing we order them to cause to proclaim us King in all the countrys where they have any interest and to raise all their fensible men with their best horses and arms and that they hinder all meetings that may be made by those who dare continue in their rebellion and seize as many of them as they can  thly That those of our friends who have had any correspondence in the north of England or in Ireland may renew it by sending some trusty persons to persuade our friends in those parts to take arms at the same time which will be of great advantage for many reasons that are obvious  thly You are to give orders from us to our friends to have a gentleman ready on the east coast of the Lothians and others on the coasts of Fife Angus and Mearns that upon a signal which shall be agreed on and will be given from the first ship that appears they may be ready  to come off with full accounts of the state of the country and may bring along with them some knowing pilots who understand the depth along the coast  thly You are also to tell our friends to give orders that all the public moneys be kept within the shires as also provisions of all kinds unsold and not sent away and that they inquire what provisions may be about Edinburgh or Leith or in any of the shires above mentioned but with great precaution in regard to the secret  thly Those who are trusted may take their own private methods to renew any correspondence they have had within the forts and garrisons and to secure upon the landing any places of strength fit for magazines All which is to be considered with a special regard to the keeping of the secret it being much safer that several things be omitted which might be very useful than that any thing be recommended which may be a means of discovery  th Lastly you are to tell our friends that we could not with safety trust to these written instructions the name of the geneal who is to command our forces under us nor the particular places where we intend to land but that as soon as it shall be proper and necessary we will fully satisfy them upon these two heads as well as upon all other matters"  The Pretender sailed from Dunkirk on the th of March N S Lockhart in his Memoirs supposes with great probability that Lewis the XlVth never designed he should land in Scotland and that Fourbin had secret orders from his master which he did not communicate It is at least certain that there are many circumstances which seem to justify this supposition and that if they had landed the troops as they might have done the greatest part of the nation would have joined the standard of the Pretender Their pretended excuse for returning as they received no signal from shore is either a proof of this or of the happy ignorance of the French in every thing regarding Britain in the only period in which they could hurt this island The fleet

instructions and in Nairne's hand The words in capitals are in the Pretender's own hand For Charles Farquharson he had first inserted James Ogilvie of Boyne but the pen is drawn through Ogilvie's name by Nairne and Charles Farquharson written above The instructions are signed by the Pretender and his seal still remains  JAMES R  "YOU are to show these instructions to such as we have ordered you and whose names for their security we will not here insert  st You are to assure them of the concern and trouble we are in on their account as well as on our own that this last enterprize has failed occasioned by our sickness the mistake of the pilates and other unforeseen accidents which gave the enemy the opportunity of preventing our landing in the firth while on the other side violent contrary winds the dispersing of the fleet the ignorance we were in of the coasts and want of provision hindered our landing in any other place  dly You are to assure them of the concern and pain we are in for them to know their present condition fearing they may have been brought into trouble after this enterprize has failed  dly You are to assure them that far from being discouraged with what has happened we are resolved to move heaven and earth and to leave no stone unturned to free ourselves and them and to that end we propose to come ourselves into the Highlands with money arms and ammunition and to put ourselves at the head of our good subjects if they are in arms for us and if not we do exhort them to rise with all convenient speed upon the expectation of our arrival which we intend shall be as soon as possible after we have had an answer to this by this honest messenger who is entirely trusted by us and since we are so desirous of venturing of our person we hope they will follow our example this being a critical time which ought not to be neglected  thly The most Christian King has likewise promised to support this undertaking with a sufficient number of troops as soon as they can be  transported with security In the mean time we will stay in the Highlands unless we be invited and encouraged by our friends in the Lowlands to go to them  thly We desire they would consider this project and with all diligence send back this bearer well informed of their opinion concerning it as also with an account of the state of the nation of what troops are in it of what country and how inclined and what number of men they can bring into the field for us  thly And in case they approve this our project and promise to stand by us we desire that all means may be used to get possession of the fort of Inverlochy and that they would inform us of the fittest place in the Highlands for our landing and send along with the bearer two or more able pilots who know these places and can conduct us into them  thly And in case they prove instrumental to our restoration by doing what is here proposed to them we promise to give them particular and essential marks of our

proposes to give to the person his Majesty intends to send to the Highlanders of Scotland"  This is a French copy in Nairne's hand of only a part of these instructions which was probably intended for the information of the French ministry The name of the person sent to Scotland this year was Ferguson  Translation  April  "IT is evident that it is the interest of his Majesty as well as of the King of England to do every thing that is possible for fomenting a civil war in Scotland since the very rumours of the last enterprise had already such an effect in England that from the eagerness of every one to withdraw his money the princess of Denmark would have had great difficulty to play the game if the affair had been prolonged for never so short a time at least it is certain that far from sending any succours to the allies she would have been obliged to recall the greatest part of her troops for her own defence  The signatures of the most considerable Scotch noblemen are an evident proof of their loyalty and they have given no room to call it in question although the public may think otherwise being ignorant of the orders which his Majesty had given them to undertake nothing before the arrival and landing of the King of England and especially to keep the secret preferable to every other consideration  The King of England far from being discouraged by the last enterprise finds himself more animated and determined by it never to spare his person but to leave no means untried for recovering his dominions It is with this design that he prepares immediately to send one to the Highlanders of Scotland with the following instructions  To assure them in case he finds them in arms that his Britannic Majesty will come immediately to put himself at their head and to bring them arms ammunition and money If they are not in arms to propose to them to rise with the like assurances that the King of England is ready to go in person to join them in expectation that his most Christian Majesty may send some troops to follow him which will be done the instant they can be transported with safety Lastly to know from them what they can do and what they wish may be done here to assist them  The same person must likewise concert the different places of landing and bring pilots along with him"  Nairne's papers D N vol ii fol No  The Pretender appears to have had great hopes at this time that his next attempt would be more successful and began already to exercise acts of sovereignty In the month of May he issued orders to his attorneygeneral or solicitorgeneral for the time being to prepare a bill in due from of law containing a grant to Herbert Roettiers to be engravergeneral of the mint in Scotland and gave Roettiers his orders about the several species of gold and silver which he was to coin  Lord Caryll's letters vol v fol Scotch College May  Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters continued  "I Find that having had lately a conference with Mr Armsworth

Jacobites in Scotland complained without reason that they were deserted by the prince whom they called to the throne The Pretender was not his own master when he was carried to the coast of Britain in a French bottom He had with tears in his eyes solicited M de Fourbir to land him on the coast of North Britain were it even with his domestics only But it seems that the French admiral had received secret orders not to permit the Pretender to slip from his hands though it is difficult to say what use the court of Versailles could make of that unfortunate prince except the making a diversion for a few months to the British arms When the pretended prince returned to France he accompanied the duke of Burgundy into Flanders and served the campaign The discontented Scots continued their solicitations to the person whom they called their King and he and his servants were equally earnest with the court of Versailles to prepare another expedition into North Britain  Lewis for some time listened with attention to the representations of the Pretender But a winter uncommonly severe which destroyed the fruits of the earth added the misfortune of famine to the numerous distresses brought on his people by the war He therefore plainly told the Pretender that he was so far from being in a condition to invade the territories of his enemies that he was afraid he could not defend his own The discontented Scots were strangers to the low state of France and they endeavoured as in the following state of the Highland clans to induce Lewis the Fourteenth to send aid by representing their own power Nothing in the paper appears to have been exaggerated though its manifest design was to encourage a French invasion  Nairne's papers D N vol ii fol No  "An account of the Highland clans in Scotland with a short narrative of the services they have rendered the crown and the number of armed men they may bring to the field for the King's service"  "THE Highlanders are used to arms from their infancy and may be reckoned as good as their equal number of the best regular troops in Europe and they have on all occasions particularly under the command of the marquis of Montrose for King Charles the First and the viscount of Dundee for King James the Seventh in several battles defeated above double their number of old regular troops and it is hardly possible to sustain their charge if they be rightly led on they being superior both in their arms and manner of fighting to any other troops  The clans are here mentioned with five hundred men to a regiment It is true that some of them can bring more men to the field and others fewer but computing them one with another they may be reckoned so  The three great branches of the M  c  Donalds viz  CLANRANALDGLENGARIESir DONALD M  c  DONALD of Sleat  The captains of Clanranald's family have still been loyal and had a good regiment in the fields for King Charles I and II and this present captain at fourteen years of age was with

great branches of M  c  Duss or Clanchattan viz  FARQUHARSONSM  c  INTOSHESM  c  PHERSONS  The Farquharsons have still been loyal for Findlay Farquharson of Braemar and Inverey was killed carrying the royal banner at the battle of Pinkie in the year against the English His grandchild James Farquharson of Inverey was at years of age kept two years prisoner at Edinburgh for his loyalty and was forced to pay a considerable fine before he was released His son colonel William Farquharson of Inverey had still a good regiment for the service of King Charles I and II under the command of the marquises of Huntley and Montrose and the earls of Glencairn and Middleton and being still without pay and at his own charges mortgaged all his estate for the said service worth about  l  sterling ayear Yet his son colonel John Farquharson of Inverey was among the first who took arms for King James VII and after all the other Highlanders had given over coming to the field he raised betwixt eight and nine hundred men and sustained the small party of the King's officers a whole campaign acting offensively as well as defensive for which he had six parishes belonging to him and his relations entirely burnt and destroyed which was procured by the lord Forbes and his family one of the most rebellious in Scotland and their next neighbours Witnesses of their last services and sufferings are colonel Rattrey major Holmes lieutenant colonel Fitzsimons and several others present in France Many of the name of Farquharson and their followers are Catholics  The M  c  Intoshes and M  c  Phersons although they did not rise to arms all of them yet they still sent men to the field both for the services of Kings Charles I and II and for King James VII and are all of them at present loyal These three forementioned branches including others lesser about them can bring to the field of very good men  The M  c  Leans have still been loyal their chief and of his name being killed at Inverkething for King Charles II by Cromwell They have been also in the field for King Charles I and they had at the battle of Killicranky for King James VII five hundred men and will be found very ready when the King shall have use for them They are mightily oppressed by the family of Argyle They can bring to the field of very good men  The Camerons have still been loyal and have still had a good regiment in the fields for Kings Charles I and II and for King James VII and continue very loyal and may bring to the field of very good men  The Stuarts and Robertsons of Athol have still been loyal and have still taken the field for the Kings Charles I and II and for King James VII notwithstanding the present marquis of Athol who was superior to the most part of them was then for the prince of Orange but it is now the better that he himself is loyal at present They may bring to the field of good men  The M  c  Naughtons and Stuarts of Appin have still been loyal to the Kings Charles I and II and to King James VII and were in the fields for them as was also M  c  Neil of Barra who with his men are all Catholics They may raise of very good men  The Drummonds' loyalty is not to be doubted since they will certainly follow their chief the duke of Perth or his son the earl of Drummond They may bring to the field of very good men  The M  c  Kenzies are neither to be doubted since they will follow their chief the marquis of Seaforth They with other little names about them may bring to the field of indifferent good men  The Frasers are loyally inclined and may bring to the field of very good men  The M  c  Leods are loyally inclined and may bring to the field of very good men  The Sinclairs are esteemed loyal and may bring to the field of indifferent good men  The M  c  Kays and the Highlanders of Strathnaver their superiors are not loyal yet their commons can be brought to the field and may do good service being joined with others they may make of very good men  The Rosses of Balnagowan their chief is not loyal yet his clan might be brought to the field and they may make of none of the best men  The Grants their chief has been very violent against the late King and raised a regiment against him and entertained it three years at his own charges yet his clan must be called to the field and joined to  others of unquestioned loyalty They may raise of none of the best of men  The Campbells of Breadalbin their superior the earl of Breadalbin is a very cunning man yet still pretends to be very loyal They may bring to the field of indifferent good men  The Grahams of Menteeth and Stuarts of Down are loyal and may bring to the field of very good men  The M  c  Neils of Galchyle M  c  Lauchlans M  c  Kinnons M  c  Aulays M  c  Nabs M  c  Gregors M  c  Gibbons M  c  Echins of Dumbarton Argyle and Stirling shires are loyal and may bring to the field amongst them all of very good men  The number of all the men is  That which is commonly objected against the Highlanders is that they do not keep discipline and that they plunder  To which it may be easily answered that at all the times the Highlanders were in the fields they neither had pay nor provisions but what Providence sent them from day to day and each soldier being obliged to go and search for himself it was impossible to send an officer with each of them so abuses could not be prevented and were the most regular troops in Europe in the same circumstances they might be found as ill if not worse than the Highlanders  Most part of all Lowlanders are their inveterate enemies and seldom or never speak or write favourably of them and that from mere envy because a Highland clan is capable to render the King better service than some of their first nobility and as to their lesser a dozen and more of them cannot bring so many men to the field as one clan  The King might likewise expect from the low countries of Scotland at least men for the King hath generally all the nation over three for him for one against him But supposing he hath but half as certainly he hath more the militia of Scotland being men that half has but to double their militia which they may easily do will make above men But the King must carry arms for them  Whereas the Highlanders are generally well armed of themselves and at most will not want above a fourth part of their arms  The Lowlanders will likewise want officers  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  "An answer proposed to be sent to the Scots in April "  Translation  "THE King of Great Britain has been very sensibly chagrined that his friends in Scotland have been kept so long in suspence concerning a second expedition into that country but it was impossible to come to any certain determination about it sooner although the affair was pressed with all possible earnestness At last his Majesty has received within a few days a decisive answer and he commands me to communicate it to you from him  I shall tell you then that the project of a second expedition into Scotland has been proposed to his most Christian Majesty in a very ample memorial in which nothing was omitted to engage him to enter into the scheme and to convince him that the enterprise was as much for his interest as for the interest of his Britannic Majesty That his most Christian Majesty has been pleased to enter very cordially into the affair when it was proposed to him and that he has taken time to consider the project and has testified a sincere desire to make every effort for putting it in execution but after having duly weighed all things and considered the present situation of his affairs his last answer has been that in the present conjuncture the thing was not practicable considering that it was absolutely impossible for him at this time to furnish all that was necessary for such an expedition  It is his Britannic Majesty's desire that you communicate this to all the wellaffected in Scotland in order that they may take their measures to preserve themselves to a more favourable time The King did not demand of his most Christian Majesty but men with money arms and ammunition in proportion But that could neither be granted nor transported with safety in the present state of the affairs of France When they are in a better situation I hope the King of Great Britain will feel the effects of it But whatever may happen he is determined never to discontinue his efforts for the recovery of his dominions and I doubt not but soon or late he will succeed although it is not easy to foresee either the time or the manner In the mean time he recommends to all his loyal subjects to take as much care as they can of their own preservation Every one knows the state of his own affairs and what is  most suitable for him to do for his own safety in this conjuncture therefore in that respect there are no rules to be prescribed to them But his Majesty always depends upon the continuance of their loyalty and he is thoroughly persuaded that he will always find them well disposed to give him proofs of their zeal and affection every time he shall have occasion for their assistance"  The States General having informed the courts of Vienna and Great Britain that the president Rouillè was come to them from France with general offers of peace prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough were sent by their respective courts to the Hague in the beginning of April To these generals who were buoyed up with the hopes of penetrating into France the next campaign the overtures made on the part of Lewis XIV seemed not to be satisfactory and the duke of Marlborough came back to London on the th of April His prosessed design was to acquaint the Queen that the French overtures were rejected and that the allies were determined to prosecute the war with the utmost vigour In the meantime Rouillè dispatched a courier to Paris for further instructions and Lewis immediately sent the marquis de Torcy his secretary for foreign affairs with fresh offers to the Hague In all the conferences held to settle the preliminaries of peace it was demanded by the allies and granted by Lewis that he should abandon the Pretender and dismiss him from his dominions This produced the following letter and memorial to the marquis de Torcy about a place of security for the Pretender a dowry for his mother and an indemnity for their adherents  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  The Earl of Middleton to the Marquis de Torcy  A copy in Middleton's own hand  Translation  St Germains  April  "I HAVE the honour to send you a memorial

case the King approves it  reserving to myself to explain to you here the sentiments of the King of England because that mixture might occasion some confusion  Although France is the only country in which his Britannic Majesty can find any consolation out of his own country yet since the enemy insist upon his leaving it he asks the King's permission to do so as the only means of giving him a testimony of his gratitude The ecclesiastical state is excluded for reasons too evident to be specified and likewise the Swiss Cantons because there he would be deprived of the society of men and at too great a distance from what he ought never to lose sight of and he would have no neighbours there but goats who could walk out and resist the rigour of the winter The Spanish Low Countries are named only in preference  I acknowledge that sentiments are divided here about the article of the indemnity Some say that those who are at home will complain with justice that they are abandoned to the fury of their enemies and that those who are here will exclaim that they are neglected that they might subsist at home if they could return in safety and that this court will be delivered from a number of troublesome people who will die of hunger after our departure Others think that a security for the past will render them useless for the future that selflove is a powerful motive for exciting the generality of men to perform their duty that severals may return from thence full of illhumour and in order to be well received will become informers which would produce very bad effects and also that this would weaken the Irish regiments in the service many of whom will be seized with the sickness of the Swiss It is hoped the King will be pleased to decide upon this diversity of opinions  With regard to the Queen's dowry her Majesty orders me to tell you that after her death and the restoration of the King her son she gives the million in the townhouse to his Majesty to refund in part some small share of his bounty But above all his Britannic Majesty insists most earnestly not to be named in the article which concerns the Queen for although there should be no express condition all the world will suppose that his honour will be deeply wounded by it He will be abandoned by all his good subjects and will find himself exposed to the contempt of every one which such a suspicion will insallibly draw upon him"  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  A Memorial sent with the preceding letter to the Marquis de Torcy  Translation  "ALL that regards the King of England's interest in the present conjuncture may be reduced to three articles  In case the enemy insist that the King of England leaves France nothing will be more natural and reasonable than to ask them a security for him It is to be wished it may be general If however this meets with difficulties let them grant it at least in a country that suits them For there are countries where he will never put his foot such as the Pope's territories and the Swiss cantons The Spanish Low Countries appear to be the most commodious from their situation and becaufe there will be no occasion for a security but from the Dutch and from the sovereign of the country who must oblige himself to allow the King to live at full liberty with a permission of travelling through all his dominions of choosing the place of his residence and of changing it and of leaving his territories and coming back again without being obliged to take passports or to give any explanations of the motives of his journies A prince cannot be too delicate in such a case and they cannot if they act sincerely refuse him the privileges which the law of nations gives to private persons in time of peace  It is proposed likewise that his Majesty may be pleased to sollicit earnestly for an indemnity to all those who have followed the late King of England and the King's son as well as for those who find themselves exposed to troublesome enquiries at home for having done their duty since the revolution in England If they make the same demand for the Hugonots it will be a mere evasion for they are desirous of keeping them designing by a general act of naturalization to draw to them every one who is not a Roman Catholic  It is not believed that they will make great difficulty about the Queen's dowry for the future but about her arrears although they cannot deny but they are due for upwards of twenty years If that cannot be obtained we must propose the time of the peace of Ryswick when the dowry was granted and when the prince of Orange broke his word although he received from his parliament a fund for keeping it he always found pretences for doing so There is another term which is common  to all widows and that is the death of their husbands and the right ceases at the death of the Queen But when the worst comes to the worst we must accept it as they will choose to give it It may be likewise proposed that in case they pay the Queen all the arrears which amount to a million sterling her Majesty will renounce absolutely her dowry the revenue of that sum being precisely l sterling at five per cent By this means several embarrassments will be avoided her Majesty will be assured of her revenue without authorizing any one in England to receive it and without disputing about the form of discharges for they may exact such as she never will grant much less will she seek redress in their courts of justice and to answer the chicane which was used after the peace of Ryswick that this money might be employed against them his Majesty may oblige himself to place the sum immediately in the townhouse of Paris"  Lord Caryll's Letters vol v fol Scotch College  Extracts from Lord Caryll's Letters  March  "HERE we talk much of a peace likely to be soon concluded I should be glad to know whether you in England be of the same opinion Upon this occasion I must not omit to let you know that I find your friend Mr Plessington the King in some doubt whether or not in case of a peace it would be best for him to continue his trade in Amsterdam Paris where there are so many dealers in his way of trading or to remove to some other town where he may find more business I am of opinion that none could advise him better in this matter than his old partners Mr Armsworth Marlborough and Mr Goulston Godolphin so that if you could conveniently meet with these two merchants or with either of them and learn their opinion in this matter you will certainly very much oblige your friend Plessington the King  The marquis de Torcy came to the Hague in the beginning of May but he could make no progress in a negociation with the States until the duke of Marlborough returned from England Conferences were then begun and in proportion as the French minister made concessions in the name of his sovereign the deputies of the States and prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough became exorbitant in their demands

Churchill and Mr Townsend about the interests of the King of England After great difficulties which they imagined to find in obtaining payment of the Queen's dowry which they allege is contrary to the laws of England they confined themselves at last to say that they would desist from their demand of the King's changing his place of abode or if they were obliged to insist upon his leaving France that it would be just in that case his expence should fall upon them and that his Majesty might choose his place of abode remain there in all security and change from place to place as would suit his

Marlborough on this subject  "He the duke of Marlborough added that this same lord meaning lord Townsend had orders concerning the King of England whom he stiled Prince of Wales He expressed a strong desire of being in a capacity to serve him as the son of a King for whom he told me afterwards he would have spilt the last drop of his blood That he believed it was his interest to remove out of France and when I asked him to what country he should retire and in what manner he was to subsist he agreed in respect to the first article that this prince should be at liberty to fix his residence whereever he chose should enjoy perfect security and be his own master to go whereever he judged proper  The article of his subsistence met with greater obstacles I proposed to him the expedient of the Queen's dowry He said that the laws of England rendered the payment of that sum extremely difficult however he begged of me to insist strenuously on this article when my lord Townsend and he came to speak to me about it in the conferences This lord he said is a kind of an inspector over me though he is a very honest man who has been chosen through my means and of the Whig party before him I must speak like an obstinate Englishman but I wish with all my heart I was able to serve the prince of Wales and that your solicitations afforded me an opportunity of doing it"  Having now complied

commanded me to beg of you to remark three things  st With regard to their saying that they cannot pay the Queen's dowry as being contrary to the laws of England In that they are not sincere for although they have converted the fund to other purposes there never was any legal decision against her Majesty or her pretensions and the parliament after the peace of Ryswick acknowledged them so fully that they granted without any difficulty the whole sum which the prince of Orange received and detained upon an ill founded chicane  dly Their offer to charge themselves with the maintainance of the King my master in case he leaves France is to be suspected and indeed one may easily perceive that the malicious design of it is to make the world believe that he renounced his pretensions on account of this pension and at the same time to have it in their power to reduce him to the last extremity which his Majesty will rather endure than expose himself to be suspected of such meanness I had set forth in a memorial all I now say and explained it more fully in a letter I sent to M de Torcy the evening before he set out  dly The King of England is highly pleased that a general security

Versailles and I entreat you to believe me to be Sir c"  The French Ministers pretended to submit to the preliminaries which were to serve as a foundation for a general peace and before it was publickly known that their master would refuse his ratification of them the court of St Germains concerted the measures which they were to follow during the negociation and proposed to send an agent to appear for them in the congress at the Hague  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  "A minute of what was proposed at St Germains in case the congress at the Hague was continued June "  "THE first step to be made is to endeavour to persuade the King of France to use his interest by his ministers at the treaty to have leave and security for a person to appear there from the King only to give in a memorial in the King's name to the mediator representing his just pretension and protesting against any thing that may be agreed upon in the general peace contrary to the right and title he has to his crown which as it will not hinder the plenipotentiaries to conclude the peace as they shall agree upon it together so it is hoped they have no interest to refuse to an injured prince the satisfaction at least of giving this public testimony to the world of his not renouncing his right or acquiescing to any thing that may be done in this treaty to his prejudice which is all the benefit required To facilitate his demand it may be represented that the King does not require the person he sends should be owned as a plenipotentiary in form from the King of England but only that he should have security to go and return and not be refused access to the mediator to deliver his message and protestation from the King and in the King's name leaving to the mediator the liberty in his answer to give or refuse the title to the King as he shall think sit only that he be obliged to enter the fact in his protoco'e that such a message memorial or protestation was delivered to him  such a day by such a one in the name of the Pretender to the crown of England if he will not directly give the King his title  If this cannot be obtained at least it may be proposed that the protestations be given by one of the French plenipotentiaries and entered as given by him in the name of the King because he could not have leave and security for a minister of his own to go and deliver it  If even that be refused there is no other method left but to send the protestation in blank covers by the post to all the plenipotentiaries and publishing it in gazettes and otherwise and mentioning at the same time that the King asked a passport for a person to go in his name to protest in the formal manner and was refused  As for any thing that may be treated about the Queen's jointure or other things relating to the security of the King's person in case of his memorial from France if Monsieur de Torcy pleases he can always obtain a pass for a private agent of the King's to attend Mr Rouillé and be at hand to represent the King's interest to him and answer the objections the English may make to him and furnish him with memorials and arguments according as shall be concerted with the court of France and this person being an Englishman and a person of known trust prudence and integrity may be of use as an interpreter with the French minister and may also being under the security of public faith be able to insinuate and disperse fit memorials to move and persuade the English or others that it is neither theirs nor the public interest of Europe to exclude the King from his right and prefer Hannover"  Lord Caryll's letters vol v fol Scotch college June  Extracts from Lord Caryll's Letters continued  "THE account which captain Gourdon's relation has brought of what passed in a conference between him and Mr Armsworth Marlborough about paying the debt so long due from that merchant shews at least the captain's zeal and concern that justice may be done to our friend Mr Mathew the King and though nothing was concluded upon at that meeting as to the speedy payment of that debt yet there is at least an entrance made towards it and I know the captain will let slip no opportunity of bringing that matter to a fair conclusion"  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  "A Memorial shewing the advantage of sending a person in whom confidence may be placed to the Hague to take care of the interests of his Britannic Majesty"  In Nairne's hand  Translation  June  "THE King of England believes that it would be necessary for his service and useful to his most Christian Majesty to send to the Hague in the present conjuncture one of his subjects who is a man of abilities and fidelity who is well instructed in his affairs and capable of carrying on a negociation who would have a communication with the French plenipotentiaries and act in concert with them in all things for the common interest and in conformity to the instructions with which he shall be intrusted without giving him any character  This man having no public character would not be subjected to ceremonies and might insinuate himself and have access every where as a private man without being suspected to be of any party and understanding the language laws customs and manners of the English he might by frequenting them discover their secret sentiments and inform the French plenipotentiaries of many things very useful in the course of the negociation it being very much the humour of the greatest part of the English who may be very reserved with the French to open themselves to and place their confidence willingly in a countryman who will appear to enter into their sentiments and have the address by discovering their different tempers to insinuate himself into their favour prudently and reasonably  This secret agent by going early to the Hague before the opening of the congress will have time to renew the old acquaintances he formerly had in that country and to form new ones to contract intimacies and manage intrigues and secret cabals with the public ministers and other men of credit of all the different nations who may meet there in the present conjuncture and of whom he may contribute to gain over some to the interest of France and to abate the violent opposition of others by undeceiving them in many wrong impressions with which they are prepossessed He will be able to inform himself thoroughly and at leisure of the different interests of the plenipotentiaries and of their cabals and  divisions among themselves that he may take the advantage of them and being of the same nation he will have a more particular facility in discovering the inclinations designs and schemes of the English plenipotentiaries of whatever sect of religion they are whose creatures they are and to what party in England they are attached and thus knowing their strength and their weakness he will be able to give from time to time excellent memorials concerning these things to the French plenipotentiaries  And when the concerns of the King of England are in agitation he will be at hand to give informations to the said plenipotentiaries concerning the intentions and real interests of his Britannic Majesty and when the English object the difficulties and chicanery of their laws as they have done already without any foundation in the affair of the Queen's dowry he will be able to tell the French plenipotentiaries with certainty what is true or false in the allegations of the English concerning their laws or the facts which shall be contested and to give them ample explanations on the spot by memorials which will refute the chicanery of the English and hinder them from imposing ambiguous expressions and advancing as truths facts which are notoriously false  The advantage of sending this man early to the Hague is evident for in order to negociate with success he must be on the spot before they begin to treat in form in order to acquaint himself thoroughly with the different characters of those with whom he may have to do to study their humours their public and private interests and to tamper with those who have credit with the principal ministers endeavouring in that manner to discover their sentiments and to find means of gaining them or at least of appeasing them on several articles from motives of personal interest joined to all the other reasons of justice and equity which can be suggested to them Now all this cannot be done but slowly and by degrees Their minds must be previously disposed and their prejudices removed and a number of emissaries must be employed in order to be well instructed in every thing that happens and to be always ready to seize every favourable opportunity He must begin in time and spare nothing to gain over favourites in order that he may have free access to their superiors and find means of insinuating himself into their confidence and of disposing them insensibly for a favourable  treaty and if all these intrigues and attentions are not begun and even carried some length before the congress opens it will be very difficult to begin them with any hopes of success during its continuance for then all the plenipotentiaries will be so occupied with receiving and sending of dispatches with attendance on all the public and private conferences with receiving and returning visits and discharging the ceremonial and essential duties of their commission that they will have so little spare time as will render access to them very difficult and as the part they are to act will be determined by that time and all or most of the essential articles agreed upon it will be too late then to hope to carry on a negociation of any importance for the service of France or for that of his Britannic Majesty"  When the congress broke off at the Hague the court of St Germains began to think again of an invasion and lord Lovat found means of sending intelligence of their

who had been raised to the office of president of the council moved for an address to the Queen that she would be pleased to stipulate in the projected treaty that the French King should own the title of Queen Anne and remove the Pretender out of his dominions The minister the earl of Godolphin and the duke of Marlborough who divided with his lordship the power of government were not averse from this motion They seem to have secretly wished his removal as the surest means of giving him the eventual succession of the throne after his sister's death as they knew the unsurmountable aversion the people had to the receiving a sovereign from FranceThe Electoral Princess afterwards Queen of Great Britain was delivered of a princess who was baptized by the name of Anne in compliment to Queen Anne

yet in one of your letters if I mistake you not you seem to say that there is at present no good understanding between these two merchants the certainty whereof I shall be glad to know in your next I

looked upon him to be too shallow to be trusted in any business of weight"  Without a date  "As to our partners if we believe Mr Brag the parliament the credit of Mr Armsworth Marlborough upon Change is greater than ever it was and much greater I fear than his honesty for if he can shift off his old debts nothing but the force of law and absolute necessity will make him satisfy them The

affection and esteem Middleton desires him to make what use of the memorial his own discretion should dictate to him but enjoins him secrecy as he had sent it without the knowledge of the court of France He thinks that the excluding the King of England and so many of his nearest heirs from succeeding to the crown will for a long time continue dissensions and wars in Europe which his restoration alone can prevent and to which he thinks the neighbouring states and particularly the Dutch are in common prudence bound to contribute He asks a passport for a trusty person whom his master might send privately to them to assure them of his attachment and to cultivate a good understanding with them  In the memorial the Pretender sets forth that as he will continue his efforts for his own restoration and the deliverance of his people a solid peace can never be established while so many millions of his subjects were well affected to him A strict union with England was necessary for the United Provinces His Majesty was sincerely disposed to cultivate a good understanding with the States and from their great wisdom and penetration he hoped to meet with corresponding sentiments in them and that they would find acts of friendship towards a prince who suffers unjustly and never was their enemy consistent with their own interest and with the principles of honour and justice England is the only rival of Holland in commerce which will often occasion animosities that will often terminate in open wars It is the interest of the States to secure the friendship of the sovereign of that country A Catholic King will be less in a condition to carry on a war against them than a Protestant and if he is but King of England he can only carry on a war by sea whereas a Protestant prince who has considerable territories on the continent and in their neighbourhood can attack them by land as well as by sea  He then recommends two points to their consideration He asks their good offices at the ensuing treaty of peace in obtaining a security for the payment of the dowry of the Queen his mother and also a security for his own person and for those who will follow him when he leaves France He gives the same reasons for these demands which are contained in the memorials presented to the court of France last year  It appears that Leers wrote several letters after receiving this memorial to the earl of Middleton There are copies in Nairne's hand of all his lordship's answers  Nairne's Papers D N vol iii No  He writes to him on the third of April that it was not his intention to propose that the States should at this time openly support all his master's pretensions He only meant that they should obtain favourable terms from the English concerning his mother's dowry and his own personal security  Ibid  In another letter to him of the same date he writes  "I am ordered in the first place to thank you for having informed me that your friends beyond the sea have consented to the payment of the dowry I hope  this payment will comprehend what is due for  at least nine years back as well as what will be due for the future But with regard to the place to which the King is to retire I am surprised Sir to see that Rome or Avignon is proposed and that Cologne or Liege are thought too near I entreat you to consider that his Majesty by removing to too great a distance would appear to renounce his pretensions Now there is no hardship which he is not determined to suffer rather than give room to suspect him of such meanness and though Avignon was situated near Oftend his Majesty would never set his foot in it because his enemies would contrive to make the general hatred to the Pope fall upon him I can assure you that the duke of Marlborough explained himself last year to Monsieur de Torcy in such a way as to make him conclude that the King would be under no restraint in choosing the place of his abode nor obliged to confine himself to any particular place and even that the English by insisting that he should leave France were obliged to provide for his subsistence"  Nairne's papers D N vol ii fol No  "Instructions to our trusty and wellbeloved Colonel Nathaniel

writing I hope I need not use many asseverations to assure you that I am my lord c  PERTH"  The Queen believes it will be necessary to send him to the Bastile He shall be sent to you as if it were to give you an account of his business He will have a letter from  me to introduce him in order that you may dispose of him as you choose But I hope you will reflect upon the mischief which his return may occasion to a number of honest men  The prosecution of Sacheverell having destroyed the influence of the Whigministry with the people the Earl of Sunderland the soninlaw of Marlborough was dismissed from the office of secretary of state in June A total change in the servants of the crown was no longer a matter of doubt with the nation though the persons who composed the administration used all their art to intimidate the Queen that they themselves might retain their power The monied interest in the city in particular the governour and directors of the bank represented the danger of turning out the lordtreasurer and such persons as he could trust The duke of Marlborough had influence sufficient with the allies to induce them to interfere in the cause of his party The comte de Galas ambassador for the Emperor and King Charles the Third together with Vrybergen the Dutch ambassador represented to the Queen the danger of making any change among her servants She however though she answered them politely seemed determined not to comply with their demands except in the article of the duke of Marlborough's continuing in the command of the army The duke himself with his usual address and coolness affected to acquiesce in the Queen's pleasure But he seems to have entered privately into a scheme of revenge by his renewing with more warmth his correspondence with the court of St Germains The following letter from the earl of Middleton will throw a complete light upon this subject  Nairne's papers vol viii to No  The Earl of Middleton to the Marquis de Torcy Inclosing a Letter from the Queen to the Duke of Marlborough  Translation  SIR  th July  "MY lord Churchill having begun to make some advances to serve the King of England in his letter to the Mareschal de Berwick to which no answer hath been made and altho' he is not a man to be depended upon yet it was always your opinion that it was necessary to treat him with attention and his present situation induces us to do so  now more than ever because being obliged to form new engagements for his own safety there is reason to fear that if we neglect him he will attach himself to the family of Hannover which would be such a fatal blow that we must employ all possible means to parry it These several considerations have induced the Queen to write him a letter of which I inclose to you a translation and her Majesty begs of you Sir to write to the Mareschal de Villars to put under his cover the letter which the chevalier de St George will give him and to send it to his adversary by the first trumpet in order to avoid the difficulty of sending it contrary to orders a m Sir c"  The copy of this letter among Mr Nairne's papers is indorsed  "To Mr de Torcy with the translation of a letter to Gurney Marlborough"  Immediately after it there is a paper entituled  "Heads of a letter to Gurney"  It appears to be the first draught of the English original of which Middleton sent the following translation to de Torcy  Nairne's Papers vol viii to No    A Letter from the Queen to Gurney Marlborough  July  Translation  WHAT you wrote to your nephew on the th of the last month is of so great importance to Mr Matthews the King and yourself that I think myself obliged for your interest and his to write to you my opinion of it with my own hand your nephew who set out from this place suddenly being now at too great a distance  I shall tell you in the first place that as I was glad to find you still continue in your good resolutions towards Mr Matthews the King I was surprised on the other hand to see that you had a design of quitting every thing as soon as the peace was concluded for I find that to be the only means of rendering you useless to your friends and your retreat may prove dangerous likewise to yourself you are too large a mark and too much exposed for malice to miss and your enemies will never believe themselves in safety until they have ruined you They will reduce the army and the troops that are allowed to stand will be all composed of their own creatures All the civil offices and military employments will be filled by men who are of their party They will change the officers of  the revenue and the credit of these new officers with the influence which the preachers of their party have over the people will not fail to produce a new parliament of a very different temper from the present thus your enemies will have all the power to hurt you and you know well they will not want the inclination  I beseech you therefore to reflect well before you deprive yourself of the means you have in your hands to support yourself and to assist your friends  But as you are lost if you quit your employments I see likewise on the other hand that it will be very difficult for you to keep yourself in office as things are now situated fo that your interest itself declares now for your honour You cannot be in safety without doing justice nor preserve your greatness without discharging your duty and the time is precious to you as well as for us  The advice you give us in sending us to the new favourite  lady  is very obliging but what can we hope from a stranger who has no obligation to us Whereas we have all the reasons in the world to depend upon you since we have now but the same interest to manage and you have the power to put Mr Matthews the King in a condition to protect you Lay aside then I beseech you your resolutions of retiring Take courage and without losing more time send us a person in whom you have an entire confidence or if you have not such a man with you allow us to send you one whom we may trust in order to concert measures for our common interest which can never be properly done by letters We shall know by your speedy and positive answer to this letter what judgment we can form of our affairs  I must not finish my letter without thanking you for promising to assist me in my suit at the treaty of peace My cause is so just that I have all reason to hope I shall gain it at least I flatter myself that Mr Matthews's sister princess of Denmark is of too good a disposition to oppose it"  Marlborough's letter to which the preceding is an answer is referred to in the following to the earl of Middleton It is in the chevalier de St George's own hand Captain Gray and the Pratler are supposed to  be James Ogilvie and lord Drummond But it is not clear who are the young Hollander and Mordecai unless the latter is the duke of Marlborough  Original Nairne's papers D N vol iii to No  The Chevalier de St George to the

for fear of the worst In the meantime what you propose of writing to Mordecai is absolutely necessary and the sooner the better When I receive the Queen's packet I shall I suppose know the end of the business and till then can say no more of it  I shall not write to the Queen today having nothing to say to her more than what is above Present my duty to her I am sorry my sister's bleeding succeeded

letter to Daniel  There is very little about Marlborough's correspondence with the duke of Berwick in Mr Nairne's papers but it appears by a letter from the marquis de Torcy to Lewis XIV dated from the Hague the th of May that letters on some interesting subjects passed between them  Memoirs of the Marquis de Torcy vol i p English translation  "After he the duke of Marlborough had consulted the pensionary and made a number of excuses and compliments for the liberty he took in appointing me an hour and not paying the first visit I went to him after dinner were I to relate all the protestations he made of his profound respect and attachment to your Majesty and of the desire he has one day of meriting your protection I should fill my letter with things less essential than those I am going to mention His speeches are florid I observed in what he said to me a great deal of art in naming the duke of Berwick and the marquis of Allegre I availed myself Sir of this circumstance to make him sensible in the course of our conversation that I was not ignorant of the particulars of their correspondence with him and that your sentiments were not changed He blushed and proceeded to

any thing to propose I will speak to him that he may do it by the next opportunity I shall go to the King's quarters  He means the quarters of the Maison du Roi  today where by contrarys I shall know

He wishes he had Lord Middleton along with him but his Lordship was more necessary where he wasThe campaign would finish soonThe Mareschal de Villars forwarded the Queen's letter to the Duke of Marlborough  Camp of Fornu  August  YOU know very well it was far from my inclination not to carry you along with me to the camp but at the same time the reasons which hindered me from doing it have not hindered me often from regretting the want of your company since I am here I said something of it in my letters to the Queen and I find by what she said you understood I ordered you to come down which was a mistake as she will have told you before this for as much as I desire your company and to have at least one wise man with me yet I think you will be more necessary where you are than here and therefore I must prefer my interest to my private satisfaction especially now that I am half seas over I thought to have gone out this evening but the weather is so hot that I shall take this day's rest after the two last days work Booth tells you our news so I shall only add that we begin now to hope we shall end the campaign on the banks of the Canihe Our general doth all he can to end his with the enemy and I left him just now in hopes of at last compassing that work but I said too much on that article yesterday and am resolved to say no more of it but mere matter of fact but I own it is hard not to lose patience when other people lose their reason I was surprised to find by my sister's letter of the th that the Queen had been ill at Marli but am mighty glad it is so well over Present her my duty  I gave the Mareschal this day the Queen's packet which I reckon gone by this time Though Follette has said nothing of her children yet Hector has again writ about them I could not put off his writing about them till I heard from you because he had now no other pretence as I thought he had Pray send me back Gourney's Marlborough's letter to him for he wants the name of the colonel that is in it I suppose my journey in  querpo  is out of doors and I hope the man that proposed  it is in prison  He probably means Ogilvie and the expedition to Scotland proposed by him  If it is to be we shall at least not want cowards  After this letter there is a paper in the earl of Middleton's hand It alludes to the disturbances occasioned in England by Sacheverel's trial It mentions an advice which Marlborough gave the court of St Germains and a proposal to be made to the court of France  The paper is as follows  Nairne's papers D N vol iii No  "SInce it has pleased God to spread the spirit of confusion amongst the King's enemies whereby they both concur for his miraculous restoration the church by proving the monarchy to be hereditary the conventicle that on that principle which they cannot confute the revolution was a rebellion and the princess Anne has no title but a violent usurpation there is no presumption to rely on providence rather than to embark in a desperate affair which may serve only to reconcile your enemies and verify what Gurney Marlborough says  The great is not to be hoped for from hence and the little ought not to be accepted without all his own subjects  He means all the Irish troops in the French service which were computed to amount to between three and four thousand men  therefore his Majesty may order this to be told to Mons de Torcy if it is refused the case is too plain to need an explanation  The court of St Germains had long doubted the sincerity of France in their cause  "  The demand referred to here is made in the following letter and memorial which are both in Nairne's hand  Ibid vol ii fol No  The Earl of Middleton to the Marquis de Torcy  Sends him a memorialthe reason whythe subjectand its importance  Translation  SIR  Chaillot  August  "YOU would have received the inclosed memorial sooner if it had not been necessary to send it first to the King my master in order  to have his approbation and receive his orders concerning it Although we were unwilling to repeat over again former memorials it was however judged necessary to put you in mind of some principal points You will find in it again the word Capital for if you begin with this project you will find every thing that is necessary to make it so But if in preference you mean to execute every other design and to put off this as superfluous I own before hand you will find nothing in it  All that is new in this memorial is the state of England and the demand made of the Irish troops As to what regards England it is a matter of indifference to you whether the parliament be dissolved or not or whether the high or the low church prevail You will always find they are your enemies and I am very sorry Sir to tell you that even our friends will do nothing for you while you do nothing for them They don't believe you are disposed to do any thing and there is nothing but an actual landing which can cure them of their credulity That will contribute to conceal the design in that country but it will be more difficult to conceal it here because all conversations at the Thuilleries and in Coffee houses run upon this project and the voice of the people desire it as the only remedy to their calamities  With regard to the demand of the Irish troops I consider it as granted because it cannot be conjectured from what motive it can be refused since besides the convincing reasons of the memorial the Irish making but half the number of troops which was proposed the armies will be less diminished by it and they will be transported with less difficulty and at less expence and it is essential to the service to do every thing which humanly may secure its success since thereby we shall gain our cause  If the bad news from Spain are confirmed they should forward this project because he will be more pressed on all sides and you will have no favourable prospect from any other quarter In short it is necessary to determine upon something Even though this project should be difficult a peace is impossible therefore there is no choice I am Sir c"  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  A Memorial to the marquis de Torcy dated at Chaillot  the th August  and sent with the preceding letter  A recapitulation of former memorialsThe present disposition of the Scotch and of the IrishThe present state of Englandand the opinions of the opposite partiesThe King offers to make a descent in Scotland with the Irish troopsThe place of embarkation  Translation  IN the several memorials which have been formerly presented to the court of France from his Britannic Majesty concerning his reestablishment it hath been shown that a wellconcerted enterprise against Scotland would be the most certain means to accomplish it and that that enterprise would at the same time be the most efficacious not to say the sole means to break the confederacy of the enemy and to reestablish France in its former superiority that all the other means tried till then whether by force of arms or by negociations had produced no effect that the enterprise against Scotland had been tried only once that it was evident to all the world it would have succeeded if several obstacles had not occurred and that both friends and enemies acknowledged that if his Britannic Majesty had landed then all Scotland would have declared for him the bank of England would have been shut up and consequently the government of England overturned and the league dissolved  It hath been shown in these memorials that the changes which happened in Scotland since that time were all advantageous to the King that the people were irritated more than ever against the present government on account of the bad treatment they had received from it that at the same time no one had deserted the King's party even after the bad success of that enterprise that no secret had been ever kept like this one since of so great a number both of the nobility and of the principal persons among the commoners there was not one who would acknowledge any thing or accuse any of those who had been apprehended notwithstanding all the threatenings and all the promises of the government and that witnesses could never be found to condemn any one of those who have been apprehended whatever efforts were made by the  servants of the government for that purpose so that there can be no doubt of the good disposition of the Scots  With regard to the Irish it hath been likewise shown in these memorials that their disposition hath been always the same with regard to their lawful sovereign founded upon interest liberty and religion and it may be added that the Catholics who are at least six to one Protestant are reduced to such despair by the last persecution of the English government and are more disposed than ever to hazard all and to undertake every thing in order to free themselves from the oppression they suffer  It is very true that in the memorials which have been hitherto presented the same assurances could not be given of the disposition of England all that could be said of it with certainty was that an insurrection in Scotland in the King's favour would have thrown the affairs of England into confusion But now it is very evident that the surprising changes which have for some time appeared in the affections of the people of England and which are seen to increase every day leave not the smallest room to doubt of their being well disposed towards their lawful sovereign  Two parties animated to an extreme against one another evidently establish the right of that prince in their public writings The high church maintain as a principle of their religion that it is never allowable to resist their King for any cause whatsoever and that the hereditary succession is a law so fundamental that the parliament itself cannot change it The low church to show the high to be enemies to the present government maintain that the consequence of the first of these principles is that the government since the Revolution hath been but a continued usurpation and that the princes who have occupied the throne have been but usurpers and that the consequence of the second principle is that the Pretender must be acknowledged as lawful King The people attentive spectators of this dispute have no difficulty in concluding that both the one and the other are in the right and the princess who is in possession by taking the high church into her considence and giving them the best employments seems to declare intelligibly enough what are her inclinations towards her brother This far the invisible hand of  Providence hath already conducted this affair employing even its greatest enemies to advance it without their perceiving it  It is therefore very evident that the present situation of his Britannic Majesty's affairs is more favourable than ever and that according to all appearances he need only have patience for a little time as several of his Majesty's friends in that country advice him and leave Providence to act in order to enter into the possession of his right by the means of his own subjects alone  But however well founded these hopes of his Britannic Majesty from his own subjects may be he is not the less sensibly affected with the bad state of the affairs of France and this is what induces him to offer now again to expose his person in a second attempt in Scotland in order to procure to France a peace of which she has so much need providing the Irish troops are given to him to attend him in the enterprize This he judges so absolutely necessary for the interest of France as well as his own that without it he believes it is needless to think of such a project  His Britannic Majesty would wish that he had no occasion for any troops for this expedition But however well assured he may be of the good will of the greatest part of Scotland yet as all the fortresses as well as the regular troops of the country are in the hands of the government and ready to act by their orders it is absolutely necessary for the security of his Majesty's person as well as for the success of the enterprize that he should have a sufficient number of troops with him at landing to oppose the enemy until his faithful subjects have time to assemble and to join him The prince of Orange although he was sure before hand of all the most considerable men in England and even of the chief officers in the army of the late King of England as appeared sufficiently by the event judged however that it was improper to undertake the enterprize without being attended with fourteen thousand regular troops  In the former memorials the King of England could never demand less than six thousand men his subjects having always asked eight thousand men to secure the success of the expedition It is true in lord Drummond's last memorial three thousand men only are mentioned  But it is likewise true that that nobleman does not deny but he has concerted his projects with the Highlanders alone without the knowledge of the chief men in the low country who compose the greatest part of the nation Yet his Britannic Majesty considering how difficult it would be to transport a greater number has limited his demand to the Irish troops his own subjects who at the end of the campaign will be scarce three thousand effective men What absolutely determines his Majesty to ask the Irish is that they speak the same language and are accustomed to the hardy manner of living of the country and that of each Irish regiment two or three may be formed by incorporating with them the new levies of the country besides that it will be impossible to keep the Irish in France after they know that the King is landed in Scotland  But there is likewise a reason which his Majesty thinks he should not pass over in silence and which appears to him to be very essential namely that the allies will no sooner see the landing succeed than dreading the consequences with which it must be infallibly attended to their disadvantage they will make fraudulent proposals of peace to France in order to ward off the blow One of these proposals will be to desire the most Christian King to withdraw the troops who may have followed that prince and as his most Christian Majesty will not choose to do so he will have a very justisiable excuse in saying that they are not his subjects but the subjects of the King of England which he could not say if they were native Frenchmen  With regard to the transport of troops and other necessaries in which the greatest difficulty consists those who have experience in maritime affairs are the best or rather the only judges of that affair What is very certain and necessary to be remarked here is that unless this enterprise is considered as a capital object to the state difficulties will occur on all hands to discourage and imaginary dangers which will become real when things are done by halves so that to attempt it in any other view will be useless to France and hurtful to the King of England But if his most Christian Majesty will find this expedition of importance enough to consider it as a capital object in that case money arms and ammunition as well as ships and troops will be found without any difficulty and he will likewise find seaofficers who will undertake it and who with God's assistance will accomplish it  The port of Dunkirk has its advantages for the embarkation on account of the neighbourhood of the troops and the shortness of the passage But the secret can never be kept for every thing that is done there is known the next day at Ostend and when once the English and the Dutch have discovered the design they will be always in a condition to thwart it  It appears then that Brest would be more suitable because the enemy could not easily hinder the vessels from sailing from that port as was seen by experience during the war in Ireland In case the preference is given to that port the Irish troops should be put into winterquarters in the neighbouring provinces  It might be likewise examined whether Portpassage near Fontarabia was sit for embarkation In that case the Irish regiments might be sent to that quarter as if they were to go to serve in Spain and his Britannic Majesty might repair thither under the same pretext and his removing at a distance from his kingdoms would conceal the design  In the case the troops embark at Brest or at Portpassage they may land anywhere on the west coast of Scotland from Kirkcudbright to the mouth of the river Clyde It is true there is no fortified harbour there nor in any other part of Scotland which would render the landing more easy But at the same time the ships could not remain there afterwards in safety in case they were pursued by a superior force  With regard to pilots they might be had from that country though not without giving some suspicion of the design But as ships from Glasgow Air and Kirkcudbright come ordinarily towards the month of November to Nantz and Bourdeaux sailors to serve as pilots might be taken out of them on different pretences Besides that some might be found among the French privateers who cruize frequently on that coast as five or six of these privateers not long ago made a descent in Scotland near Air from whence they carried away some cattle and alarmed the country It may be known from them where they got their pilots and their method may be followed  The squadron sailing from Brest or from Portpassage may steer their course through St George's channel or round the west of Ireland the first is the shortest course but is esteemed the most dangerous Yet the English merchantships daily pass through that channel at all seasons  In failing along the coast of Ireland some Irish officers may be landed with arms c in order to put the inhabitants in a condition to rise  But without entering into a more ample detail of the measures which should be taken to secure the success of the expedition and referring for that purpose to former memorials we shall only repeat in concluding that the success will entirely depend on the manner in which the enterprise is considered as of greater or less importance to France It is the business of his most Christian Majesty to judge of this by his consummate prudence and to determine according to the interest of his own affairs"  The following anecdote deserves credit from collateral proofs There is no doubt but Marlborough and Godolphin had talked about a scheme of restoring the Pretender some time or other without the assistance of France Godolphin was probably sincere so would Marlborough have been should the thing itself happen to suit his interest  Carte's Memorandumbook marked vol xi p  "LORD Godolphin had certainly the best head and capacity for a minister of state of any man in England and was a man that no country in the world might be ashamed of He had not the least tincture of avarice and was the uncorruptest man in his time in the management of the treasury and discharge of his offices He was lord chamberlain to King James's Queen who had always as Mr Dillon told me April d a very great opinion of him and Mr Dillon believes he really intended to serve the King He has sent many of his letters to that Queen and the letters are still in being  One reason perhaps why he did not execute what he projected was his cowardice Nobody could have more of that temper of mind and he was so susceptible of fear that the Whigs could bully and frighten him into any thing  This has made me remember what the E of A who was very intimate with him told me in viz That lord Godolphin was the truest and sincerest friend to the King that he ever had and that after his disgrace on Dr Sacheverel's trial about a month after he was turned out making him a visit lord Godolphin expressed his concern at his being turned out before he had restored the King that he had been in unhappy circumstances and distressed by the Tories that all his ministry  had been spent in a struggle with the junto whose hands the Tories had forced him into but that he saw himself at last master over them when he was turned out on occasion of the trial which he was noways concerned at but on the King's account That however he was of opinion lord Oxford would restore him but he would make France necessary to it which himself would not have done for he would have restored him alone and made the French know how poorly they had treated him and how little they deserved at his hands and the E of A believed him"  Mr Charles Booth was groom of the bedchamber at St Germains He attended the Chevalier de St George during the campaign of which is called "The King's third campaign" from the th of May to the th of September  Nairne's Papers D N vol iii No  he wrote upwards of an hundred letters to the earl of Middleton giving him the news of the campaign and an account of his master's health and conduct The following passages are extracts from these letters  "May the th Mr Tunstal  Mr Tunstal signs his letters and is frequently mentioned in Middleton and Carryl's letters under the name of Trevers  was here he had a long conference with my lord Churchill who asked him several times what was the reason your lordship was not with the prince of Wales He made answer it was to save charges "One more would not augment it much"  June th  "The King went out to day to take the air having none with him but us three when we came to our outguards we saw the enemy and our people talking across a very little river he sent me to inquire if there were any English I found several English and Scots I inquired after several of their people and sent my service to them they put my name and those I inquired after in their tablets I told them I was there waiting on the Chevalier de St George by that time the King was come pretty near I shewed him to them then rode up to the King and Mr Hamilton was resolved to speak to them they were gone from the bank of the river but I called after one of them who came back Mr Hamilton sent his service to lord Marlborough and lord George and shewed them the King who was on the bank of the river"  June th  "An officer of theirs came towards the river the Chevalier was reconnoitring with Mareschal Villars and Booth and Strickland were detached to see if the enemy would fire or talk to them which made us push on I inquired for all I knew and some I did not They answered me very civilly I desired my service to them which gave me an opportunity of telling my name He said he knew my name and my employment But just then came in Jack the Frenchman I went a little lower where was about fifteen English officers we saluted one anotherYour cousin Howarth is well I saw him to day You may believe how many services I sent him and all friends with them and how gladly I should be to serve any of them Their answers were just the same"  June th  "I found major Hamilton that your lordship saw at Captain Murray was there before and told his old acquaintance the Chevalier was not far off Will he not come this way says he that we may see him Mr Murray told the King the King came up There were about ten or twelve officers Mr Murray asked Hamilton what news they had of a peace He said they durst not talk of it before prince Eugene but when they were with the Dutch they talked of nothing else"  July th  "This day I sent by Lumney's trumpet six medals  The duchess of Gordon presented one of these medals the next year to the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland It had a head on the right side with this legend  Cujus est  and on the reverse the British islands with this motto  Reddite  These medals were struck upon the hopes which the manner of asserting the doctrines of hereditary right and passive obedience during and after Sacheverel's trial gave the Jacobites  one to him one to lord George one to lieutenant general Withers one to lieutenant general Wood and one to the major I had the discourse over the water with and one to a friend of mine that will not hide it I writ to Mr Pitts lord Churchill's master of horse about some business I have with him and told him all here were perfectly well"  July th  "The Mareschal de Villars asked what news from England when I told him I knew none he said all things went well and that there would be a new parliament and that the doctor Sacheverel had a great party for him"  July d  "The King commands me to give your lordship an account how I disposed of the medals after I had sent some of them to the lieutenant generals by their own trumpets that did not know what they carried I proposed to the King and Mr Hamilton to send one or two to lord Churchill's master of the horse because I was in commerce of letters with him they seemed not to like it but left it to me conditionally it might not appear the King knew of it I told the King those I had already sent were so ordered that they could not suspect he had any knowledge of it so I had  carte blanche  One of Nugent's trumpets going to their army three days ago I had occasion to write to Mr Pitts and as a postscript I told him I had given the trumpet some new coin that he would see none such in the contribution money if he were curious he might see it and keep it if he liked it if not send it back by the trumpet After he had read my letter the trumpet as I had ordered him was going away to see if Pitts would call for them What says he Mr Booth writes you have something for me so the trumpet gave them to him The trumpet being an Irishman Pitts did not speak one word to him but in the morning he called a trumpet of the guarddecorps into his chamber and shewed the medals to him and bid him tell me he would give the medals back when he saw me but never before The French trumpet came to me before the Irishman came home and asked me what those medals were for that above thirty English officers spoke to him to bring them medals The fellow told them what was true he did not know what they meant When you come back go to the Chevalier de St George's and desire of the chamberlain which is the trumpet's translation of groom of the bedchamber to send us some medals for he has sent many here and he will give you more The trumpet told me lord Churchill enquired very particularly how the Chevalier de St George did and what was the matter with him  When the Irish trumpet came home he brought me several letters all directed for me with his Highness the prince of Wales Pitts said in his your coin does not go in this army but it being fine I shall keep it among my precious things I shall answer Mr Pitts and tell him I wonder they that fight for the Gospel should not make that coin current in as much as it is taken out of the Gospel that he and I know a man may make it current if he pleases I told the enemy's

October November and December but they are all allegorical and without a key One can only understand from them in general that proposals were to be made to the new ministry that Abram had a paper given him the year before written all by John Jolly's the King's own hand with a discretionary power to produce it when he thought necessary which on the receipt of a letter from Lamb he had orders now to do and that Lord Middleton invited Lamb  i e  Mr Lesley to go over to France and expected great satisfaction from his informations Lord Duplin's marriage to the earl of Oxford's daughter is probably referred to in the following passage in one of his lordship's letters to Abram  "I was surprised to hear that  Miss Honyton  had married a myrmidonPly the soninlaw with the most effectual promises for himself and his fatherinlaw he being foreman of the jury and without him we cannot hope for a favourable verdict"  HANNOVER PAPERS    THE Whigs frequently upbraided the Tories with being Jacobites and abettors of an arbitrary power in the crown The Tories charged the Whigs with being antimonarchical and republican But if one was to form his judgement of their principles from their own professions it would be difficult to distinguish them for both parties courted popularity by the same arts and publickly professed to espouse the succession in the protestant line It will be seen by the correspondence of this year that each as soon as they came into place were equally ready to make their court to the presumptive heirs of the crown  To defend Queen Anne from being charged with inconstancy weakness or ingratitude for removing and disgracing men who had served her long and faithfully doctor Swift insinuates that the Marlborough family had lost all favour with her Majesty upon her accession to the throne though she possessed the art of disguising her passions so perfectly as to have been able to conceal for a long time the aversion she had conceived for them It is not probable that her aversion began so early and tho' it is not easy to guess when she began to be sensible of the haughty and imperious behaviour of the party which governed her and the nation it is certain that nothing contributed more to alienate her affections totally from them than their conduct and speeches in the course of doctor Sacheverel's trial Godolphin began the prosecution more from private resentment than state necessity and imprudently furnished his enemies with an opportunity of ruining him and his friends when he unwarily gave importance to a man and a cause which he should have treated with neglect and contempt  The Queen was present at the trial and listened with great attention to the debates in which a spirit of opposition betrayed both parties to advance principles which probably neither of them would follow to their utmost extent The Tories openly maintained the doctrine of hereditary right and nonresistance and the Whigs in justifying the Revolution asserted a nation's right to depose and dethrone their sovereign and laid down maxims of government more favourable to the privileges of parliament and the liberties of the people than monarchs choose to adopt  The Tories had not strength to prevent Sacheverel from being found guilty of all the articles for which he was impeached by the commons but they had influence afterwards to procure addresses to the Queen from all parts of the nation avowing the very principles for which he was condemned These addresses asserted the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance and acknowledged the absolute power of the crown They condemned as antimonarchical and republican all doctrines which allowed subjects to resist their sovereigns in any instance and declared the defenders of these doctrines to be advocates of blasphemy and impiety they affirmed that the Queen acceded to the throne by a hereditary and not by a precarious parliamentary right or election they entreated a dissolution of the present parliament and contained assurances that none should be chosen in a new election but such as should be loyal to the sovereign and zealous for the church  These addresses could not fail to be more agreeable to Anne a woman and a sovereign than those presented by the Whigs in a different though dutiful and respectful strain In consequence of the first she determined to emancipate herself and to change her ministry notwithstanding the success with which they had served her and an interposition in their favour by the ministers of the Emperor and of the Statesgeneral who were directed to represent to her Majesty what bad influence a change might have on affairs abroad  This change furnishes a new set of correspondents in the course of this year when the following persons came into office The duke of Shrewsbury was made lord chamberlain on the th of April in the room of the marquis of Kent who was gratified with a dukedom Dartmouth was made secretary of state in the room of the  earl of Sunderland who was turned out the th of June The earl of Godolphin was dismissed the th of August and in his room earl Powlet Robert Harley Henry Paget Sir Thomas Mansel and Robert Benson were appointed commissioners of the treasury Though Powlet was the first commissioner in form it was well known that Harley who was made chancellor and undertreasurer of the exchequer had the chief management of the treasury and presided in every thing behind the curtain  Mr James Cresset who had been formerly envoy extraordinary at the courts of Zell and Hannover was chosen by the new ministry to carry assurances of their attachment to the presumptive heirs of the crown and upon his death which happened soon after his nomination the earl of Rivers was sent to Hannover in the month of August with the same commission He was authorized to assure the princess Sophia and her son the Elector that the late changes for which the Queen had sufficient reasons were rather favourable to them and a further security for their succession to the crown  On the st of September the Queen issued a proclamation to dissolve the parliament The earl of Rochester was made lord president of the council in the room of lord Somers The lord chamberlain's staff was taken from the duke of Devonshire and given to the duke of Buckingham Mr Boyle was dismissed from the post of secretary of state and the seals were given to Mr Henry St John The great seal upon the resignation of the lord chancellor Cowper was given to Sir Simon Harcourt and the lord lieutenancy of Ireland to the duke of Ormond upon the resignation of the earl of Wharton The earl of Portmore was appointed commander in chief of her Majesty's forces in Portugal and the duke of Hamilton lord lieutenant of the county palatine of Lancaster  Harley did not make such an entire change as the Tories expected But the numbers who were turned out of office now and on another occasion soon after sufficiently prove that the Whigs had as carefully excluded the Tories from all places of honour and profit as the Tories would have now excluded the Whigs in their turn The military operations mentioned in the correspondence of this year are the taking of Douay on the th of June of Bethune the th August of St Venant the th September and of Aire the th November The baron  de Bothmar was expected as envoy extraordinary from the Elector

reasons and after having made all the efforts and all the remonstrances possible for putting things on that side in the state which the good of the common cause required I even proposed effectual means for obliging all those to furnish their contingent who had neglected it but far from succeeding that measure has only served to draw on me their hatred Besides some circles do not choose to

was absolutely without a remedy I thought I could not continue to command an army so ill provided in every thing without exposing my reputation and I declared this early lest I should occasion any disappointment  I entreat your Majesty to be persuaded that this will not hinder me from shewing always the same zeal as well in exhorting the different members of the Empire to do what they ought for

nothing would be more just than to imitate the great example which your Majesty gives in that respect It does not depend upon my representations that that does not happen in the Empire but they have been hitherto so ineffectual that I dare not promise myself a better success for the future This obliged me to divest myself of the command of the army on the Rhine as I did myself the honour of notifying to your Majesty by my former letter I would imagine that I encroached upon your time if I repeated the reasons which it contains I flatter myself that your Majesty will honour them with your approbation and that you will acknowledge that nothing but an absolute necessiry could induce me to adopt such a measure and that feeing my presence useless with the army on the Rhine and my reputation exposed I ought not to render myself responsible for the bad consequences which the disorders that I endeavoured so ineffectually to redress might have I shall not spare however either my

the resolution which you took of divesting yourself of the command of the army on the Rhine as you notified to me in your letter of the th of January and confirmed again by another of the th of February I am very sorry  that you have had so many reasons to induce you to adopt that measure  but as I am persuaded that your presence with that army is of the last importance I cannot hinder myself from hoping that matters will run in a better train and that the states of the Empire seeing that they are to lose such a leader at the head of their troops will exert themselves to remedy the disorders of which they complain and for this purpose I wrote some time ago to the princes and circles of the Empire and I pressed strongly his Imperial Majesty to remove the difficulties which may hinder you and I have reason to believe that my representations have had a good effect for I own that my confidence with regard to that army was always in your conduct and in your valour And you appear to me to be the only one who is able to render it in some measure useful to the common cause and if you absolutely throw up that command I see nothing that can keep the enemy at bay on that side The season for the campaign advances and a diversion on the upper Rhine will have an extraordinary effect to the advantage of the common cause It is for this reason I continue to shew you still the desire I have that you may reconcile yourself to the command of the army on the Rhine for this year and I assure you at the same time that there is no one who has your reputation more at heart

September  "IT is with joy I presume once more with the most profound respect imaginable to address myself to your Electoral Highness and to tell you that her Majesty begins to reign and that the

prerogative of two or three subjects for some years" He then tells him that her Majesty has placed herself on the throne and at the head of her treasury That she has sent bills of exchange to Holland for paying her troops in Flanders and Portugal "and she has made sufficient provision for their payment for the next six months notwithstanding the tricks and chicane of the lord Godolphin and his party"  "The nation in general adores her Majesty and commends extremely the conduct of the new ministry who had the courage and loyalty so seasonably to preserve the Queen and the monarchy It is very certain that four years ago the Queen thought of dismissing her treasurer and her general But the corruption of the two last parliaments always prevented her" By Mr Harley's good offices he says the Queen received the duke of Shrewsbury into her confidence as well as Mr Harley himself "who was always very loyal and active and religiously devoted to the interests of her Majesty and the protestant succession in the illustrious family of your Electoral Highness"  "The Queen cannot avoid suspecting all those who have a familiar correspondence with her general who had already set himself up as a protector and his creatures had the insolence as well as the impudence during all the last winter to drink to his health under that sine title" He tells him that the general and treasurer afraid of contributing to the  advantage of his Electoral Highness and of restoring to the Queen the liberty of which she had been so long deprived were induced to intrigue with their party in the house of commons to take notice of some imprudent expressions of the speaker and by that means to embarrass her Majesty's affairs and prevent their own fall When Shrewsbury he says was put in possession of his office without the knowledge of the treasurer or the general his duchess with her usual insolence began to quarrel with her Majesty But her Majesty wearied of hearing so much abuse from such a peevish woman forbad her to appear in her presence since which time her Majesty has been allowed to transact business in peace  "At length the earl of Rivers is gone to fulfil the office which Mr Cresset  Mr Cresset had been sent in capacity of envoy from her Majesty to his Electoral Highness  had to execute An individual should never pretend to know what the commissions of his sovereign contain with

who were almost all seduced or rather charmed and bewitched by him for very strong reasons no doubt give out in their public walks and conversation that lord Rivers is sent by her Majesty to offer the command of the army to your Electoral Highness at least to come over to this country and pay a visit to her Majesty c What say they will a great sovereign prince as the Elector of Brunswick leave his own dominions and visit the Queen or will he chuse to command an army after a general who has triumphed so often gained so many battles and taken so many towns These wicked men have for a long time exposed your Electoral Highness in this manner" He tells his Electoral Highness that Charles V visited Henry VIII and that King William visited the duke of Zell and his Electoral Highness That since her Majesty has thought proper to dismiss her general he asks "if there is any one so proper to command the armies of the Queen and the British nation as the protestant successor in which protestant successor her Majesty and her people place all their hopes" c  He prosesses his attachment to the Electoral family and entreats his Electoral Highness to accept of the command of the army He exclaims against the measures of the late ministry and says that her Majesty had just reason to be offended with them and he concludes with praying "God to preserve the person of your Electoral Highness with

the parliament it is natural for the Whigs to defend that authority and the parliamentary right to the crown for otherwise they would declare themselves traitors and rebels And as the establishment of the Hannoverian succession is a consequence of the Revolution and a work of the late King your court should take it well of the Whigs that they defend the Revolution and should excuse some expressions in their last writings which appear to carry too far the authority of the parliament in the affair of the succession and the more so that the maxims of the Tories tending directly to prepare the way

December  "IF a prince there is so good and wise as to be content to govern according to the constitution and laws of the land he may employ whoever he pleaseth in his service without regarding the opinion of  others but with this reserve that if they act ill that he will leave them always to be judged by the laws of the land and such a declaration would be the best means to suppress insolence and parties  But now as to the highchurch  There are parishes in England and consequently so many parsons but their number may be at least more to supply cures and who seek preferment  Ten or fifteen of this number have made it their business to preach that the church is in danger though the church enjoys all the privileges that the law does allow them but the clergymen in England would have the same power over the people that the church of Rome had in the time of its dominion over us  The Queen and parliament have now declared that they will maintain the church as established by law so that they will not gain any thing by their noise only this ministry have blown them up to recommend them and their party to govern the helm which point they have gained and the poor ambitious priests will be left in the lurch  The priests handle edged tools which any prince may cut them with when he pleases for the laws are so severe against their encroachments that they are in danger of treason or premunire upon the least fault and the civil government hath been so jealous of their impertinence that the convocation of the clergy cannot do any thing but by commission from the King or Queen and they cannot debate upon or resolve any point but such as are permitted in their commission and which resolved they are not valid unless the Queen approves them  So that you see our church is limited by law I think it good in its constitution and doctrine but shall never encourage or consent to the pride ambition and dominion of  prists  which hath occasioned so much bloodshed in the world in all

protestant succession but they supposed that he would sacrifice his principles to his prudence especially as his political enemies had obtained the confidence of the family of Hannover The adherents of the court of St Germains judging superficially of things built much on the supposed attachment of Queen Anne to her brother and the violent principles of the Tories in favour of the hereditary succession of the crown They were too weak or too ignorant to perceive that the timidity of the Queen was little calculated to favour their cause and that the professions of the Tories consisted merely of empty clamour and noise In this state of deception they renewed or rather continued with encreasing vehemence their correspondence with Great Britain and the intelligence which they sent and

measures in England as there has been since the last change in the ministry and the affair of Greenshields a minister of the church of England whom the parliament has lately protected against  the presbyterians of Scotland has irritated the latter to such a degree that they would concur in whatever might deliver them from the Union with England which is universally detested in Scotland where they are all persuaded that nothing can deliver them from it but the return of their sovereign  There is at present a concurrence of circumstances more favourable for an enterprise than there has been since his Majesty came out of England But all this will change in time and for the future they will attend only to the means of supporting as easily as they can the chains from which they see no further hopes of being delivered  There is not a man in Great Britain who is not convinced that if the King of England had landed the last time in Scotland he would have infallibly succeeded and the conjuncture appears at present still more favourable than it was then The inclination of the Scots towards their King appears visible in their sending as members to parliament the same men who had been brought prisoners to London on account of the invasion and I can assure that these men have not changed their sentiments The presbyterians in Scotland opposed the elections as much as they could and their ministers preached against them but in vain for these members were chosen in spite of them by a great majority of voices  At the time of the last expedition to Scotland men ran in crowds and with so great eagerness to withdraw their stock out of the Bank that the commons were obliged to pass a law declaring all those to be enemies to the government and to the nation who should demand their money from the Bank at that time but instead of curing the evil thereby they increased the discontent every one exclaiming that it was cruel to treat as enemies to the state those who called for their money when they had occasion for it and if news had not come that the King of England had returned to France with the fleet in twelve hours later the Bank would have been shut up This is well known to all those who were then in London and is known throughout all England insomuch that since that time the credit of the Bank is greatly diminished Not long ago the news of the failing of or privateers from Dunkirk gave the alarm in England that the Pretender was coming upon which severals  with some of whom I am acquainted ran immediately to the Bank to demand their money and there is no doubt but the same thing will happen universally whenever there is a real invasion All the funds will fail no tax will be paid but what is raised by force no one will choo  e to advance money upon the security of the funds and without it it will be impossible to make new preparations for opposing the invasion  If the Bank of England fails I believe there is no doubt that the Confederates will not be able to support the war and then his most Christian Majesty will have a safe game to play without running any risk Troops are daily draughted to be sent out of the kingdom so that few will be left to make opposition and there are severals in the army who have discovered their dispositions of returning to their duty towards their King if they found the opportunity  They are preparing fleets to be sent to the Mediterranean and elsewhere so that the few ships which will remain to guard the channel cannot hinder the passage from Brest to Kirkcudbright especially if an alarm is given from Dunkirk and other ports All the fleet of England can never hinder a squadron to pass from Brest to Ireland and Scotland is only a little more distant in the same line  Severals in England wish the King well who would not hazard their estates for him but these very people would not willingly hazard any thing against him if they saw the smallest risk on the side of the government It seems therefore that the greatest number want only an opportunity of declaring themselves that is to say the return of his Britannic Majesty with a force sufficient to protect those who would choose to join him on his arrival If he came with men it is thought there would not be a sword drawn against him but if he cannot have that number men would render the success probable but not so certain  It is generally thought that the princess of Denmark is favourably inclined towards the King her brother and that she would choose rather to have him for her successor than the prince of Hannover But she is timid and does not know to whom she can give her confidence The duke of Leeds told me that he had endeavoured to sound her as much as he could upon this subject and he is in her confidence and has free access to her but though she never chose to explain herself upon  this point she says nothing against him It is thought that if the King of England was in Scotland a treaty with him would be immediately proposed and then the members of parliament would be at liberty to declare their sentiments whereas they are now restrained by an act of parliament which declares all those guilty of high treason who shall oppose the Hannoverian succession by word or by writing But the King of England being in Scotland and all the kingdom acknowledging him which could not fail to happen soon after his arrival in that country then the present nccessity and the common good of the nation would authorise the liberty which each might take of proposing whatever could prevent the fatal effects of a civil war I am well assured that some members of parliament would speak boldly in that case and I have also reason to believe that there are several others who only want a similar conjuncture for declaring themselves and who would do it cordially and there is scarcely any doubt but the greatest number would be for a treaty Those who would oppose it would not render themselves popular and might be considered as the enemies of the peace and settlement of the nation and the very rumour of the treaty would make the people consider the King as already in possession and as the rising sun I believe there is no example in our history that the lawful heir has been admitted to a treaty when his right was not acknowledged as in the case of Stephen and Henry II of Richard duke of York and of Henry VI c and the princess of Denmark having no children would render the affair still more easy both with regard to herself and with regard to the people  The Archduke had none of these motives to encourage his enterprise and was not assured of having one miquilite for him when he undertook to make that diversion in Spain which has continued for so many years and is not yet finished The diversion of the malecontents in Hungary has been of considerable advantage to France and it was by marching into Saxony that the King of Sweden obliged King Augustus to submit  The smallest advantage which an expedition of the King of England into Scotland could produce would be a civil war which might be supported from time to time by France even though none of his Majesty's subjects should join him but that is not to be supposed for in the divisions of parties there are now malecontents enough in Great Britain  who would rejoice at that opportunity of joining him besides so many others in distressed circumstances or on bad terms with the government whom fear resentment or hope would influence and there are men of that character in every country but no where so many as there are at present in Great Britain But it is certain that the greatest number of the Scots are disposed to join their King from inclination and from a principle of loyalty This is evident from all that they have suffered with so much constancy for above two and twenty years and that there is a considerable number of them appears from the apprehensions the government entertain of them and the measures they take to apprehend the leaders on every alarm But there are besides a set of men welldisposed who have taken the oaths to the government only by form and from interest and whom general Stanhope in Sacheverel's trial calls the nonjurorswearers These are very numerous in the two kingdoms There is not a highchurch man in England that is not suspected by the government This is the case with all those who have presented addresses for maintaining hereditary right and the maxim of the church of England that a prince is never to be resisted and these comprehend almost the whole nation excepting such as are Whigs or Presbyterians by profession who however are become the contempt and aversion of the people  Malicious and injurious expressions against the King are no longer used even by the Whigs who dare not now express themselves as they did formerly They acknowledged his birth in Sacheverel's trial in order to destroy hereditary right by that means and to convince the princess of Denmark that she has no other title to the crown but the settlement which has been made for the succession since the Revolution and the generality speak with esteem and respect of the King's person  I do not intend to conceal any thing The only objection against the King is his religion but that is not imputed to him as a fault but as his misfortune and ours and the people would endure him much more willingly if they did not believe him a bigot to his religion and this is the idea his enemies endeavour to give of him as much as they can  To obviate this objection the following means are judged useful by his Majesty's friends who persuade themselves that he will be ready to do on his part all that is lawful for him to bring about his restoration  and God forbid that more should be demanded of him to gain even all the kingdoms of the earth  st The King of England therefore must not either by word or by insinuation give any reason to believe that he is capable of dissembling his religion Every one would have a worse opinion of him on that account and less credit would be given to all that he could say  But to remove the objection of bigotry and blind zeal it is proposed he should acquaint his subjects that when it shall please God to restore him to his kingdoms and to give him a proper opportunity he will not refuse to hear whatever can be said to him with respect and submission in favour of the religion of his dominions But whatever may be the issue of this with regard to his Majesty's religion that will not diminish our loyalty and our entire submission to him as our lawful sovereign  It is not understood by this that there is to be a public dispute which is a sort of combat of gladiators for victory and which ends generally in increasing the differences and exasperating the animosities upon both sides the pride of man having a natural aversion to appear to be convinced accordingly when reasons fail pride summons all the passions to its aid and then the combat is carried on with bitterness and with personal reflections which produce a hatred that excludes all means of reconciliation  No this is not pretended it is proposed only that his Britannic Majesty should not refuse to hear a reasonable man who will explain to him with all the deference and respect that is due to him the principles of the church of England and that afterwards he should determine as God and his conscience will dictate to him but at the same time he should preserve to the church of England all legal securities for its establishment and support  dly It is proposed in order to remove all suspicion and prejudice against his Majesty that when he comes over he should bring no more priests along with him than he has occasion for It is the interest of the King of England especially on his arrival to give the people advantageous impressions of him afterwards things will be more easy When he is on the throne and the people find that their religion their liberty  and their fortunes arc safe he may then have as many priests with him as he pleases without being found fault with So that it is only proposed to deprive himself of some of them for a little time  The pen is drawn through the last paragraph in the copy probably to prevent giving offence to the bigotry of Lewis XIV for whose perusal the translation of the memorial was intended    dly If his most Christian Majesty would only connive at allowing the Protestant domestics of the King of England to assemble themselves from time to time at St Germains in order to worship God in the most secret manner that possibly could be that would do more service than men For in England that would appear as a sort of toleration with regard to his attendants and being obtained by his Britanni  Majesty every one would consider it as a mark of his inclination to favour his protestant subjects and as a pledge of what they might expect from him when he was restored to his throne Besides that it would entirely remove the objection of bigotry If it could be said in England that the King has procured for the protestant servants who attend him the liberty which is here proposed for them that would be half the way to his restoration I only repeat here the very words which I have heard from sensible men in London  thly When the King of England comes it will be proper to have in his company some minister of the church of England who is of an approved character in order to preach to the people as soon as he lands without trusting to chance and employing the first whom he finds on the place and who may be either disaffected or incapable  thly It is necessary to bring along with him all the Irish troops who will be very agreeable to the Highlanders because they speak the same language but above all to bring the duke of Berwick along with him for he is feared and loved and his presence will prevent all the disputes which may arise among the nobility of Scotland for the command of the army for they will all submit to him and they all desire that he may come  Time presses and appears short for according to all appearances the next winter will produce a peace and then the King of England must be reduced to begin every thing anew for bringing about his restoration and to seek new and uncertain measures to accomplish it  If the princess of Denmark who is very infirm dies and if the prince of Hannover is once in possession he will bring along with him his German troops who in virtue of the last act of parliament will be naturalized the moment they arrive and he will humble and ruin all the King of England's friends and render by these means his cause desperate"  The pen is drawn through what follows  "If his most Christian Majesty is not in a condition now to furnish troops and other succours necessary to the King of England for an expedition into Scotland may not some proposals be made to the King of Sweden Will not that prince be very well pleased to have such an ally to assist him to obtain satisfaction from the King of Denmark and to defend his coasts against the Muscovites And in case of a double marriage which might be proposed to him he would have a chance of succeeding to the crown of England as the King of England would have to that of Sweden Their religion cannot be objected against the Swedes for the prince of Hannover is a Lutheran  If his most Christian Majesty chooses rather to land or men to the assistance of the King of Sweden than to risk his troops and his ships on an expedition to Scotland the King of Sweden might send an equal number of troops to Scotland much more easily because the passage is much shorter and considering that that prince is engaged in sitting out considerable armaments both by sea and by land against the Danes and against the Muscovites the real designs of his preparations will never be suspected He may be the more easily reconciled to this that the government of England is not very favourably disposed towards him of which his Swedish Majesty appears by his last declaration to be very sensible declaring war against them in some measure and considering them as the aggressors because they engaged to maintain a neutrality in the north of Germany and nothing appears more natural and more conform to the genius of that prince than to enter into an alliance with the King of England who may write to him by the means of the Swedish resident who is here until he can send a minister to treat with him Besides that prince is guarantee of the peace of Riswick and has a right to interest himself in the present war and by an alliance with the King of England he might once more have the balance of Europe in his hands  and give a general peace upon reasonable terms and these two princes thus allied would be in a condition to maintain the peace against all those who would incline to disturb it and to prevent any rebellion that might arise in their respective dominions"  The dismission of the Whig ministry last year was followed by a dissolution of the parliament Doctor Sacheverel's trial and his pompous procession to the country when he went to his living in North Wales inflamed the passions of the people and influenced the elections in favour of the Tories The expectations from a Tory ministry and the proceedings of the new parliament reanimated the hopes of the Jacobites as appears from their own correspondence with their friends abroad and from the Pretender's recommending to his adherents to support the measures of the present administration  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  A letter to a friend with a state of affairs in England  A copy in Nairne's hand with corrections interlined in lord Middleton's  Violence of both Whigs and ToriesThe Whigs are attached to the family of HannoverTo prevent a civil war the King should come over and the laws settling the succession be repealedThe Pretender recommended to his friends to support the measures of the court and the present ministry  SIR  "SINCE you desire my opinion upon the present state of affairs of our country and that you assure me I may with all safety conside my private thoughts to you I shall tell you here very plainly what I think most adviseable in the present conjuncture  I need not go about to prove that the house of Hannover and the States of Holland are united with the Whigs and discontented party of England against the Queen her present ministry and the church of England  Their late proceedings have sufficiently shewn their inclinations that way and nothing is more obvious than that the church and court party can expect no quarter from these three united powers if ever they come to have the superiority They think they have been very ill used and after resenting their pretended injuries so publickly as they have done  it is not to be expected they will ever hardly pardon 'Tis pretty plain they are in a sort of confederacy together and that they are resolved to stand and fall by one another The duke of Hannover has in conjunction with the States declared himself so openly for the Whig party in opposition to the Queen herself as well as her ministry that it is visible he is inseparably united to that party and will always be influenced by it and that if ever he comes to have the power in his hands the church and present ministry must fall a sacrifice to the Whigs' revenge the breach being too wide to expect they can ever be thoroughly reconciled  I am of opinion therefore that as matters stand now there remains only one expedient that can possibly secure at once both the church and state against any attempt that may be made to their prejudice either during the Queen's life or after her death by a powerful absolute prince supported by a jealous interested nation abroad and animated by an exasperated factious party at home and that is to call home the Queen's brother whose just right gains ground daily in the hearts of his subjects in order to which I think it not only advisable but absolutely necessary to send to treat with him without loss of time for all depends upon taking timely measures it being of the last importance to the court and country interest as well as his to be beforehand with their common adversaries Accidents may happen we are all mortal and if things be not prepared and secured before a vacancy it will be very hard after that to avoid a civil war for we all know that according to the laws now in being Hannover in that case must of course be proclaimed King It will be too late then to repeal those laws which make it high treason to oppose him and it is not to be doubted but he will quickly come over here and bring with him if it be necessary all the force the Hollanders and he can draw together On the other hand it is certain the King will not be wanting on his side to transport himself at any rate into some part of his dominions to join with his friends in order to assert his right and venture all rather than have the shame and grief to see a foreign Ur take peaceable possession of his lawful inheritance This must unavoidably produce a civil war which is perhaps what the Hollanders wish for the fatal consequences of which may last and extend nobody knows how far  The only remedy I see to prevent these misfortunes and save our nation from ruin and bloodshed is the proposal above mentioned of sending immediately upon the conclusion of the peace to treat with her Majesty's brother the King and call him home privately upon the first recess of parliament  This is absolutely the quickest safest and easiest way for all other flow dilatory methods of preparing things by degrees managing the opposite party waiting for new favourable opportunities and keeping in the mean time this prince at a distance are exposed to too many dangers and difficulties besides that unanswerable one of a sudden mortality which as it may very possibly happen to our great grief and misfortune when we expect it least so it is the height of imprudence not to prepare against it  It would require a great deal of more time than we can in prudence promise to ourselves to go about to repeal the act of the settlement of the crown in a parliamentary way before he be called over so I think that tedious method nowise advisable Besides that the undertaking itself might meet with such opposition in his absence as would expose it to the danger of a miscarriage whereas he being once upon the place invited thither and countenanced by her Majesty which is no hard matter to contrive so as to make it very practicable in the recess of parliament without the least danger of disturbance those very persons who would have opposed him in parliament and every where else in his absence will be the first to come and kiss his hand when he is here and comply with whatever the Queen shall think fit to do in his favour  It is so visibly the Queen's and the present ministry's true interest to call her only brother home in this conjuncture that he and they may be a mutual support and security to one another that I am morally assured he will not make the least difficulty to trust himself entirely into their hands whenever they please to call him and that he will be willing even to come over with a page only to accompany him upon the Queen his sister's letter if it be thought fit and necessary for his and their common interest so to do and when he is once here I am sure nobody will dare to find fault with the Queen's receiving him kindly She may safely present him to her council own him there for her brother  and declare her good intentions towards him and what she has thought fit with the advice of her ministers to treat and concert with him for the future good and peace of her kingdoms After which step it will be infinitely more easy and less hazardous by any other method whatsoever to get the present settlement of the succession altered in the next meeting of the parliament and every thing regulated there to their mutual satisfaction and all the rights and privileges of church and state crown parliament and people settled again upon the solid foundation of the ancient laws and constitution of the kingdom  But to assure the success of this great work I think it absolutely best when he is invited over that he be allowed to come straight to London where his sudden and unexpected appearance will surprise and confound all his unprepared enemies break all their measures and make every thing go so quick and easy on the Queen's side and his that they will soon by the wise conduct of the present ministry put it out of the power of either Hannover or the discontented Whigs to disturb the new settlement that shall be agreed upon between the brother and his now only sister But in case things be not thought ripe enough or sufficiently disposed to bring him straight to London the next best will be to bring him to Scotland which would be better by far than sending him a travelling into foreign countries Only one thing is to be observed as to Scotland that the government of the church there being Presbyterian and the generality of that nation being discontented with the Union which we in England think our interest to maintain he may perhaps have some hard proposals made to him upon that head by a prevalent party in that kingdom which will make him very uneasy by putting a disagreeable necessity upon him of refusing what he cannot grant to them without disobliging the English which I have good reason to be believe he is resolved not to do it being contrary to his inclination as well as his interest to do any thing in favour of one nation that may be a just ground of grievance to another his intention as I am credibly informed being to leave all those matters of state as well as of religion to be entirely decided and settled in a British parliament  Thus Sir I have in compliance to your desire opened my mind freely to you upon a very nice point I hope from your friendship for me and your known discretion in matters of this importance that you  will not communicate this paper but where you are sure it will be safe and where you have reason to hope it may be of some use I shall conclude with assuring you that you are the only person to whom it is sent and that neither the person by whose conveyance it comes nor any other person whatever on your side knows any thing of the contents of it Any thing that tends towards Jacobitism as I own this letter does sounds ill in the ears of those who are always used to tack popery slavery and arbitrary government together and have no other notion of a popish King but that of a bigot tyrant But I who know from unquestionable hands that the Pretender as we call him here besides his other great and good qualities is too wise and too just a prince to think of persecuting any body for his religion that on the contrary all those of our church that are about him at present have distinguished marks of his bounty shewn to them with assurances that it shall not be his fault if they have not the full exercise of their religion whenever they go with him I who know also that he has sent particular directions to his friends here to join themselves unanimously to vote for and support the measures of the court and present ministry with all the interest they have am not only fully persuaded of his true affection for his sister and love for his country but am also convinced in my conscience that our established religion as well as our liberties estates and employments and every thing else that is dear to us will be infinitely more secure under his government than under a Lutheran foreign prince influenced by German and Whig counsels and therefore to you I am not afraid nor ashamed to own myself so far a Jacobite as to wish a good understanding between our gracious Queen and her brother which I look upon to be the only means to make her Majesty happy easy and safe as long as she lives our present ministry out of danger of being ever oppressed by their enemies our church safe and our country happy To be a Jacobite at this rate in my opinion is to be a true patriot and a faithful subject and I hope you do me the justice to have no other opinion of Sir c  Whatever might have been the disposition of her ministry there is reason to think that the Queen herself was now inclined to secure the succession to her brother In the following rough draught of a letter to her in  English of which there is also a draught of a French translation among Nairne's papers and both in Nairne's hand the Chevalier puts her in mind of a promise she had made to their father and proposes to her that she should send over to him a trusty person with whom he might enter into a treaty It is evidently the Pretender's own diction

violence and ambition of the enemies of our family and of the monarchy have too long kept at distance those who by all the obligations of nature and duty ought to be more firmly united and have hindered us from the proper means and endeavours of a better understanding between us which could not fail to produce the most happy effects to ourselves to our family and to our bleeding country  But whatever the success may be I have resolved now to break through all reserve and to be the first in an endeavour so just and necessary The natural affection I bear you and that the King our father had for you till his last breath the consideration of our mutual interest honour and safety and the duty I owe to God and my country are the true motives that persuade me to write to you and to do all that is possible for me to come to a perfect union with you  And you may be assured Madam that though I can never abandon but with my life my own just right which you know is unalterably settled by the most fundamental laws of the land yet I am most desirous rather to owe to you than to any living the recovery of it It is for yourself that a work so just and glorious is reserved The voice of God and nature calls you to it the promises you made to the King our father enjoin it the preservation of our family the preventing of unnatural wars require it and the public good and welfare of our country recommend it to you to rescue it from present and future evils which must to the latest posterity involve the nation in blood and confusion till the succession be again settled in the right line  I am satisfied  Madam that if you will be guided by your own inclinations you will readily comply with so just and fair a proposal as to prefer your own brother the last male of our name to the dutchess of Hannover the remotest relation we have whose friendship you have no reason to rely on or be fond of who will leave the government to foreigners of another language of another interest and who by the general naturalization may bring over crowds of his countrymen to supply the defect of his right and enslave the nation  In the meantime I assure you Madam and am ready to give all the security that can be desired that it is my unalterable resolution to make the law of the land the rule of my government to preserve every man's right liberty and property equally with the rights of the crown and to secure and maintain those of the church of England in all their just rights and privileges as by law established and to grant such a toleration to dissenters as the parliament shall think fit  Your own good nature Madam and your natural affection to a brother from whom you never received any injury cannot but incline your heart to do him justice and as it is in your power I cannot doubt of your good inclinations And I do here assure you that in that case no reasonable terms of accommodation which you can desire for yourself shall be refused by me But as affairs of this moment cannot be so well transacted by letters I must conjure you to send one over to me fully instructed and empowered by you or to give security for such a one from me for by that way only things can be adjusted to our mutual satisfaction which shall be managed on our side with the utmost secrecy  I have made this first step towards our mutual happiness with a true brotherly affection with the plainness and sincerity that becomes both our rank and relation and in the most prudent manner I could at present contrive and will be directed by you in the prosecution of it relying entirely on your knowledge and experience as to the means and instruments  And now Madam as you tender your own honour and happiness the preservation and reestablishment of our ancient royal family the safety and welfare of a brave people who are almost sinking under present weights and have reason to fear greater who have no reason to  complain of me and whom I must still and do love as my own I conjure you to meet me in this friendly way of composing our difference by which only we can hope for those good effects which will make us both happy yourself more glorious than all the other parts of your life

my grandfather and my father too had always a good opinion of the principles of the church of England relating to monarchy and experience sufficiently sheweth that the crown was never struck at but she also felt the blow and though some of her chief professors have failed in their duty we must not measure the principles of a church by the actions of some particulars  Plain dealing is best in all things especially in matters of religion and as I am resolved never to dissemble in religion so I shall never tempt others to do it and as well as I am satisfied of the truth of my own religion yet I shall never look worse upon any persons because in this they chance to differ with me nor shall I refuse in due time and place to hear what they have to say upon this subject But they must not take it

two months since I writ my last to you and my journey home being much about the same time your lawyer Churchill was in motion made him a little concerned for fear he should not have had an opportunity of speaking to me before he left these parts for good and all this he shewed in a more open manner than usual for he asked particularly after of me of after one that had gone from our town to wait upon him and commissioned him at his return to inquire whether I was come back or no and if so to tell me he had a mind to see me But at this gentleman's return I not being arrived he neglected to send any more to our house and I had like to have lost the news of this intimation As soon as I knew it in the uncertainty I was in to find Mr James Churchill your lawyer I writ to one of his

looks upon it certain that an accommodation peace will be  made  and if he shall be found capable of helping on the signing this deed he assures Mr Bernard the Queen of his best services But he

Masham He looks upon the strongly insisting upon and gaining this point of the deed to be of great consequence not only as to the making my lady Betty the Queen easy as to her own circumstances but very much conducing to the advancing Mr Athony's the King's interest and this not so much again as to the money itself as that the grant of it which cannot be refused it being formerly concluded and granted at Povey peace and funds being set aside for it and only diverted by "the unworthiness of him who then ruled the roast" and continual payment will be a means to make people open their eyes even in regard to Mr Andrew the King and see better their own interest in reference to the same "whose cause has got so much sensible ground for these latter years that to assure me more I suppose of his real interior sentiments he swore solemnly he thought it could not fail of coming to a happy issue nay that both sides would see an absolute necessity of having recourse to him as the only means left of securing solid peace and happiness not so much perchance either Mr Robert High Church or cousin Simon Whigs out of any true principles of conscience or honesty for he does not think either deserves the name of Lumsdell Loyal  As to Mr Antony's the King's business it must be managed with a great deal of dexterity He was not a little startled at the news of his going to Mr Price the Pope it would not have been well at all He says when they begin to work at Povey peace perchance Mr Edward King of France and his Fredlingers ministers who will be willing to consecrate any thing to their own ends will be consenting to Mr Athony's the King's going to live some where with Mr Price the Pope or some where in that country and he fancies that something of that kind may be insisted upon by others in Evans England by that means to persuade the tenants that they are altogether for excluding the Thomists Catholics and all for Gregory Hannover "But he declares as much as he can judge of things that Mr Athony's the King's  going thither must never be granted to" And this he looks upon as a point of the last importance for he declares he thinks it absolutely contrary to Mr Athony's interest and therefore though Mr Edward King of France should consent to it and people in Evans England push for it it must not be done and he desired me in particular to assure you of this and he swore it by the living God that he thought that if Mr Benjamin the Queen ever consented to this that 'twas no better than ruining and quite murdering this son's the Grot's King's cause If it be necessary or judged advantageous to quit Forster France let him go to his uncle David Germany or rather have recourse to some free seat But I asked him what security for his person there being such a writ out against him He answered he really did not think he wanted any security for nobody would touch him "As for his part he had seen such visible changes for the better of late on all sides that he thought the gaining of his cause could not but follow" And when he gets his estate he hopes he will make his tenants easy and not thinking of annulling any regulations made for the cutting down woods and altering other farms for these many years for that will bring dangerous consequences the interest of so many persons being engaged who otherwise would come in to him  When Mrs Betty's deed the Queen's jointure is insisted upon if it was to be put to Philip Cook the parliament you will find many he is persuaded even willing to help it on and glad of an occasion of making their compliments  à bon grace  and giving some testimony of their goodwill If she thinks that he shall be in any capacity of serving her in this point she needs only to signify to him what she expects from him and he will be very glad of the occasion of showing himself her humble servant He insinuated a desire you should be sensible that what he has done for these many years and seem to affirm the same of others has not been out of any spleen or illwill against you but only to put down Foster France which he always judged the true interest of Mrs Edwards England whose cause alone he pleaded for He thinks certainly there will be an accommodation for when he was last winter at Mrs Evans England he saw so much of the disposition of the people that if all were to be polled nine in ten would absolutely vote for Povey peace being spent on all sides by so long a lawsuit  A great many he says have taken strange methods of late which contrary to the intentions of those that made use of them will prove very much to the advantage of Mr Andrew's the King's cause and God who rules above seems visibly to dispose all things for the best Neither your cousin Temple the Tories nor Wilson the Whigs are much to be relyed on quatenus such but all that they have or seem to be a doing will insensibly reduce both of them more and more to the necessity of doing Mr Athony's the King's business and even calling for him  To signify these things to you was the reason of his calling for me and he desired I would tike an occasion of waiting upon you for this intent but I hope the writing this will suffice if not you know where to command After my compliments to him I told him as to myself I was much more afraid of the issue of his suits in this following season than in the former He owned he had been treated unworthily upon several accounts but that was nothing For his part God had blessed him with a great deal of temper and he had taken the resolution of being quiet for the present but he would expect his time and if Mr Matthew Harley or others pushed things to greater extremities they should give him perchance only better hold and they should find what metal he was made of  He desired that his compliments might be made in a particular manner to Mr Barker Berwick and Mr Wal E Midd and bade me tell the latter that he hoped Mr Wal E Midd would live to see better times and more according to his satisfaction He was pleased to ask me many questions about Mr Walter's E Midd's conversion and said he had heard at the beginning as if he had had a mind of retiring from business for good and all As for his conversion I told him it was beyond all doubt truly solid and certainly upon motives altogether christian and for the rumour of his having a mind to retire perchance his retiring to our little seminary at Onksi Paris might give occasion of that rumour but this was only to do his work he had undertaken more efficaciously and first cleanse the garden of so many weeds that had overrun it and secondly plant the same with necessary adornments I think he answered it is what we must all come to but I did not understand him perfectly  As for the working at Povey peace he thought they had taken all their measures to do the business without him and as for his part he desired nothing more than to be at quiet Some business to settle matters abroad would detain him yet a little while at Mr Harrison's Holland but when that was done he would hasten home where he would maintain himself against them all and if Mr Mathews Harley or others pushed matters any farther against him perchance so much the better  But after he had used a great many compliments c towards you I thought it would not be amiss civilly to urge him to something more positive and endeavour to see if there were any more solid assurances to be had from him above what one might call a compliment and for the purpose I objected this to him that some might say he being a lawyer of such interest why would not he stickle more in Mr Anthony the King and Barnard's the Queen's suits He answered he did not know what he could do directly in the matter but only by managing people so on occasions as to make them enter into the aforesaid interests and they might assure themselves nothing should be wanting on his side as occasions should present He owned indeed that he had acted with a great deal of animosity against Foster France and he always thought it the interest of his country so to do but not against them and really seemed to shew a great desire of all things prospering with you and said that God Almighty had disposed things so that he solemnly swore again that he thought Mr Anthony's the King's business could not fail of going forward and that his Rode religion would not be any hinderance to it for all the protestations Evans England had made to the contrary He says he knows your cousin Harry princess of Denmark perfectly well that he is a very honest person but easily won and wrought upon but at the bottom he certainly has no aversion from his brother Alexander the King But he princess Anne is one that must not be frightened and the lawyer Churchill says he thinks any extern force used will rather do more harm than good both in regard of Harry princess Anne and others Whereas if one will but let things go on their own train Alexander the King's business will go on of itself and he does not doubt but will come to a happy conclusion  I wish it was in my power in any manner to conduce to it It shall always lay close to my heart and be the subject of my best prayers with all the assurances of my most humble duty whilst your most obedient and humble servant  Nov the d  TUNSTALL TREVER"  Nairne's Papers vol viii No  The Earl of Middleton to Mr Tunstal  An Answer to the

also to favour Phipps as also to keep well with Prior to know ail he could from him and send account here"  A clandestine negociation had now been carried on for five months between France and England Mr Prior went to France in the month of July and came back with Mr Mesnager and the abbé Gaultier in the month of August Preliminary articles were signed in London about the latter end of September and notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Emperor and of the States and a spirited and vehement memorial from the Elector of Hannover it was determined to open a general congress at Utrecht in the beginning of the ensuing year The court of St Germains seem to have had such confidence in the attachment of Queen Anne and her ministry to their cause that they were not so uneasy now at the news of a general peace as at the time of the treaty at Ryswick The Dauphin paid them a visit and congratulated them on their prospect They did not however neglect the measures which prudence suggested on the occasian  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  A Memorial given to the Marquis de Torcy from which he may form instructions to the plenipotentiaries of his most Christian Majesty at Utrecht concerning the succession to the crown of England  This Memorial which is but a copy in Nairne's hand begins with setting forth the disadvantages of which a disputed title to the crown had been formerly and will always continue to be to England and then proceeds as follows  December  "IT would be proper to show the English that the monarchy and the hierarchy having such a close connexion and so much dependence the one upon the other the one cannot possibly subsist without the other as might be easily shown by arguments and examples A King must entirely neglect his own interests when he does not protect and maintain  the church of England  in all its rights and privileges and therefore as there is not a stronger tye than common interest the members of that church may be sure that the King will never depart from the solemn promises which he hath already made to them and which he is ready to confirm to them that he will protect and maintain them in the peaceful possession of all their rights privileges and immunities which have been granted to them by acts of parliament and the common law of the kingdom  And in order to remove all their uneasiness on the article of religion it may be shown to them that in the year the King having been informed by men of rank of the church of England that in order to render their religion perfectly secure under a Catholic King they wished that his Majesty would grant them certain privileges even beyond what the acts of parliament and common law of the kingdom allow them his Majesty having examined their demands granted them immediately although they could not deny themselves but by granting them he derogated from the rights and prerogatives of the crown"  Then follows a copy of the declaration  "It appears plainly then to any one who will reflect that it is the interest of the English nation to finish as soon as possible all disputes about the succession of the crown by reestablishing it in the right line and it appears likewise that the catholic religion which is the only thing that can be objected to the King is of no prejudice to them but on the contrary an advantage as his Majesty yields to the church of England what no Protestant King would yield to them therefore the members of that church will find their account and have their privileges more enlarged and their securities better established under the King being a catholic than if he was a protestant"  After proposing in the very words of the  Sieur Lamb  that is doctor Leslie that the act of settlement should be repealed that every one might be at liberty to declare his sentiments the Memorialist proceeds  "After the act which exchanged the succession shall be repealed it would be necessary to send over the King to England that he might learn what is necessary for him to know in order to govern his people by instructing himself in the laws and customs of the country and likewise  that he might be beforehand with the Dutch who might otherwise upon the first news of the death of the reigning princess transport thither the prince of Hannover which would infallibly produce a civil war with which they would be very well pleased because they would find their account in it Moreover they know that the prince of Hannover who has not the best title on his side will stand in need of a foreign support to maintain him and as he cannot find it any where but with them they will by that dependence reassume the direction of all the affairs of England as they did during the government of the prince of Orange which will nowise suit either the humours or the interests of the English nation  When the King would be transported to England the best means of securing to him the succession would be to treat him as a sovereign in which it does not appear there would be any inconveniency to the reigning princess who for associating her brother to the royal title will not the less peaceably enjoy all her authority during her own life as it has been seen lately that the kingdom was governed peaceably under the names of William and Mary although the first had all the administration and as it was seen formerly that the same kingdom was governed as peaceably under the names of Philip and Mary although the last alone had the whole administration"  Nairne's Papers D N vol ii fol No  A Memorial concerning the dowry of the Queen of England and the indemnity of the King of England's subjects given to the Marquis de Torcy in December  THIS memorial recites that the late King had made a settlement of  l  sterling upon the Queen by letters patent under the great seal which was afterwards confirmed by acts of parliament which have never been repealed that according to the prerogatives of the Queens of England she had appointed her own officers and disposed of her revenues from the date of the settlement that therefore she has an undoubted right to what is due since she left England and that if she could claim it according to the usual forms there is not a court of justice in England but what would decide it in her favour  The memorial mentions in the next place that her pretensions were sustained by the English themselves at the treaty of Ryswick and recites  the particulars which may be seen in the preceding volume among the papers of that period  "A promise so solemn reiterated and confirmed in a manner so positive and so precise and without any condition should not have met with any difficulty in the execution and the more so that the parliament of England made no difficulty of testifying in a very effectual manner their approbation of that promise by furnishing the prince with the means of performing it for in the first session after the peace the commons assembled in parliament granted him a new fund of a hundred thousand pounds sterling of an additional revenue of which they appropriated the half to supply the funds on which the appanage had been assigned and which had been otherwise employed and to show further that it was their intention that the sum should be paid honestly to the Queen according to the promise publickly and positively made in the name of the nation without exacting any condition from her Majesty they added a clause by which it was declared that those who should be employed to remit the money to the Queen in France should not be subject to the penalties of the law which forbade all correspondence with the court of St Germains This evidently shows that the pretended condition which was afterwards alleged to elude the payment was illfounded and that the parliament never thought of exacting such conditions"  The memorial next proposes that at the ensuing treaty of peace the sum of  l  should be secured to the Queen for life and that all the arrears due since the Revolution at least since the treaty of Ryswick should be paid It specifies the manner in which this should be done particularly that the Queen should be at liberty to nominate any person she chose to receive her money and to grant valid discharges to the government of England without her being obliged to sign any other deed engagement or acknowledgment but a procuration to them to act in her name"  This memorial is followed by another demanding a general indemnity for all the English Scots and Irish who went over to France since the Revolution  HANNOVER PAPERS    TO explain the papers of the family of Hannover in the present year a short detail of leading facts may be necessary The baron de Bothmar envoy extraordinary from the Elector arrived in London early this year Though the duke of Marlborough was permitted to retain the command of the army the dutchess was deprived of all her employments and Harley at the desire of the Queen informed the court of Hannover of her dismission The Electoral Prince who had been elected a Knight of the Garter in was installed at Windsor in December the lord Halifax serving as his proxy The earl of Rochester the Queen's maternal uncle who from his rank abilities experience in business and influence with the highchurch party was the only rival of Harley died suddenly in the May of the present year A fair field being left for Harley's ambition he became lordtreasurer earl of Oxford and Mortimer and was considered as prime minister  Marlborough endeavouring to overcome his enemies in the cabinet by the splendour of his actions in the field made various but unsuccessful efforts to force the Mareschal de Villars to a battle He however by a sudden exertion surprised the famous lines with which the French had joined the Scheld the Sansette the Scarpe and the Ugy The consequence of this enterprise was the siege and surrender of Bouchain the last exploit of the duke of Marlborough Mr Matthew Prior having been sent clandestinely by the ministry with preliminaries of peace to France arrived at Fountainbleau in the month of July Lewis the XIV afraid either to accept or refuse the terms offered by Prior sent to London in his company Mons Menager and the famous Abbé du Bois An intimate correspondence was established between the British and French  ministers and preliminary articles to the satisfaction of both were signed on the twentyseventh of September The Queen sent the earl of Rivers to Hannover to assure the Elector that the succession of his family to the crown of Great Britain should be secured in the treaty The earl of Oxford and his associates made the same assurances in vain the jealousy of his Electoral Highness having been raised by the emissaries of the Whigs  The lord Raby who had been appointed in the preceding March ambassador extraordinary to the Statesgeneral was created earl of Strafford in the beginning of September and in the end of that month was sent back to Holland to press the opening of a general congress The privyseal upon the death of the duke of Newcastle was delivered into the custody of Dr Robinson bishop of Bristol who was intended to be joined as plenipotentiary to the earl of Strafford on the expected congress Doctor Swift gives the character of both very justly in a few words  "They were practiced in business but possessed no parts Strafford hath some life and spirit but is infinitely proud and wholly illiterate"  His lordship's letters indeed furnish no proof of his learning and Robinson was a heavy though decent man  An incident in Scotland employed the attention of the court of Hannover in the present year The dutchess of Gordon a Roman Catholic presuming on the temper of the times sent a medal of the Pretender to Mr Robert Bennet dean of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh This piece of silver had a legend upon it importing that the kingdom should be restored to the right owner At a meeting of the Faculty thanks were voted to her Grace and Mr Robert Dundas of Arniston returned them in terms sufficiently seditious and bold He thanked her for presenting them with a medal of their sovereign lord the King He hoped that her Grace would soon have an opportunity of presenting to the faculty of Advocates a second medal struck upon the restoration of the King and royal family and the finishing of rebellion usurpation tyranny and whiggery No inquiry was made into this affair till the baron de Kreyenberg in the name of his master the Elector complained of the conduct of the advocates to the Queen In compliance with his representation Sir David Dalrymple the lord advocate who was a Whig when it suited with his own interest was dismissed from his office  for his being remiss in the prosecution of the delinquents  The premising of these facts will explain the correspondence of this year  Robethon's original Draught Hannover Papers vol marked Princes No  The Elector to Mr

year For this purpose all the troops must be complete on the th of March and magazines of forage will be formed on the frontiers But the principal subject of consideration was how to carry on the war in Spain with the greatest vigour Her Majesty on her side makes her utmost efforts she takes more of Imperial cavalry into her pay and furnishes recruits for the Imperial infantry at the rate of crowns each she is at the expence of transporting them all to Catalonia besides an equal number of recruits for the English infantry and five battalions of an augmentation it is expected that these have failed already This is intended as an example to excite the court of Vienna and the Statesgeneral to exert themselves likewise on their side Prince Eugene at parting gave reason to hope that the Emperor would send four battalions to Spain if the States would do as much The province of Holland has taken a favourable resolution in consequence of this and it is hoped the other provinces will soon follow the example especially as count Zinzendorff has since declared his Imperial Majesty's consent to this augmentation These troops will be a powerful succour if they arrive in time and the greatest care will be taken that they shall but the bad news we have lately received from that country will oblige both the one and the other to take still more vigorous resolutions  I entreat your

drawn up a project which I have conveyed in confidence to the ministers in England and Holland Without having communicated it however to any of our generals here I do myself the honour to send a copy of it to your Electoral Highness and I humbly entreat you after having well examined it to acquaint me with your sentiments and if you find any thing to be added to it I acknowledge to your Electoral Highness that I see no other means of procuring a good peace but by pushing the enemy with vigour on this side which cannot be effectuated but by being before them in the field I am with a most respectful attachment c"  Robethon's original draught Ibid No  The Elector to the Duke of Marlborough  Demands some of his regiments of dragoons and cavalry during the winter  Translation  My Lord  Sept th  "AS it appears that the Kings of Denmark and of Poland cannot possess themselves of any place of strength in Pomerania the season being too far advanced it is to be presumed that the troops after having ravaged the enemy's country will return to take up their winterquarters in Mecklenburg and in other places in the circle of the Lower Saxony and that his Danish Majesty will choose to place troops in the country of Bremen It is easy to conceive that by that means the slames of war may extend themselves farther into the empire to the great prejudice of the allies and you know besides Sir that the situation of my dominions is such that they cannot be safe if the flames of war communicate  themselves to the country of Bremen  It is therefore very necessary either for diverting the court of Denmark from such an intention or for giving weight to the negociations which I may set on foot with that court concerning this affair that I should have some cavalry and dragoons here next winter it being impossible to be able with four or five battalions which are left with me to provide with any efficacy for the safety of my dominions and of all this neighbourhood I will therefore have a very particular obligation to you if you employ your influence to obtain permission from the Queen for some of the regiments of cavalry and dragoons which I have in her Majesty's pay to come back to my own dominions after the campaign as the regiment of Haher came back last winter and upon the same footing They may be absent from the Low Countries during the winter without any prejudice to the public and it is precisely during that season that I shall have need of them here I do not foresce that any thing can hinder me from sending them back to you at the opening of the next campaign but by neglecting this precaution some events may happen in my neighbourhood next winter which will oblige me to recall all the troops I have in the service of the Queen and of the States I hope you will be pleased to exert yourself to obtain this favour from the Queen This new proof of her kindness will attach me more and more to her interests and I shall retain the greatest gratitude to you on account of it I am very sincerely my Lord your affectionate servant"  Robethon's original Draught Hannover Papers vol marked Princes No  The Elector to the Earl of Oxford  The same

represent to you that the advanced season does not permit the princes who are consederated against Sweden to possess themselves of any place of strength in Pomerania It appears certain that their troops after having committed some ravages will return to take up their winterquarters in different places in the circle of the Lower Saxony and particularly in Mecklenburg and that his Danish Majesty will choose to place some troops in the country of Bremen It is easy to conceive that this may  be the means of carrying the war to this side of the Elbe from whence it may extend itself farther into the empire to the great prejudice of the allies Besides the situation of my dominions is such that they cannot be in safety if the war should communicate itself to the country of Bremen  I shall employ all my attentions to divert the court of Denmark from forming this project But my lord you are too penetrating not to see that having but very few infantry without any cavalry in my dominions I cannot exert myself with efficacy for the security of this neighbourhood and of my own territories and that it is very necessary in order to give weight to the negociations which I design to set on foot with the enemies of Sweden and to the proposals which I may make to them that I should have some cavalry and dragoons here next winter As the design I have in view is the common interest of all the allies and as I shall act in perfect concert with the Queen I hope her Majesty will permit some of the regiments of cavalry and dragoons which I have in her pay to return to my dominions as the regiment of Hahn returned last winter and upon the same footing I will owe you my lord a very particular obligation if you will be pleased to employ your influence with the Queen in obtaining this favour from her by representing to her that these regiments may be absent from the Low Countries during the winter without any prejudice to the public and that I can send them back at the opening of the next campaign whereas by neglecting this precaution some events may happen next winter in my neighbourhood which will oblige me to recall all the troops which I have in the service of the Queen and of the States I wrote on this very subject to the duke of Marlborough It is of such importance that I cannot doubt but you will interest yourself in its success I entreat you my lord to be

SIR  Camp before Bouchain  Sept th  "SINCE the letter I did myself the honour of writing to your Electoral Highness we have been employed in the siege of Bouchain  in order to secure a post on the other side of the Scheld It will be imagined perhaps considering the vigour of the attacks that the siege hath continued too long indeed the enemy take every method to hinder us from finishing it and the neighbourhood not to say the presence of a superior army always employed in distressing us encouraged the besieged to be obstinate But at length we have found means of surmounting all obstacles

of operations for the ensuing campaign I cannot but approve of it in all respects and I consider it with you as the surest means of reducing France to the necessity of concurring in a reasonable peace But I imagine you will allow that secrecy is the life of this project and that it is necessary to avoid with all possible attention to give the enemy any room to perceive it since in that case they will not fail to take the necessary measures for preventing a blow which may be so fatal to them and for forming magazines on their side whatever expence they may cost them I leave you then Sir to reflect if by stationing the cavalry on the frontiers you will not discover too clearly to the French what is so  necessary to conceal from them It appears to me likewise that my troops though sent to more distant places may by speedy marches arrive time enough at the place where you will judge proper to assemble the army As to the rest I hope that the measures which you will take for the execution of your project will be no obstacle to the return of the few regiments of cavalry and dragoons which the necessity arising from the state of affairs obliges me to demand of the Queen for some months

parliament As it does not become us to make this subscription we shall not resolve upon it but in case of necessity preferring in all respects to be paid this debt in cash Our intention therefore is that you should make representations to the lord treasurer to obtain this payment assuring him that we shall be very particularly obliged to the Queen if her Majesty would be pleased to take upon her own account stocks of the South Sea company for the sum which is due to us and pay to us that sum as it is very just we should receive it complete after having waited for it so long  If this expedient is not practicable it will be necessary to subscribe to the company and you will find inclosed the procuration which is necessary to authorise you to do so on our account But you are not to use it but a few days before the th of December the day on which  the books are closed since it is likely that before that day the baron de Bothmar our plenipotentiary may arrive in London he having orders to go over with the earl of Rivers and we wish the baron de Bothmar may have time again to make representations to the lord treasurer for obtaining payment of this money▪ You are to prepare the treasurer for this and to ask him if the stocks being only at and it being unjust to give us but  l  sterling to pay us for they could not give us stock for the per cent remaining which upon the whole sum would be an augmentation of  l  sterling  We leave the names blank in the procuration in order that if the baron de Bothmar judges it more proper to fill it up with his own he may do it if not it must be

peace upon the terms proposed  Translation  Gohre  Nov  "I Consider as a continuation of the friendship which you always testified for me that you have been pleased to communicate to me the commission which the Queen gave you to treat of a peace in concurrence with the Statesgeneral It is true that the Earl of Rivers likewise has had orders to communicate to the Elector my son and to me her Majesty's laudable intentions but he did not enlarge upon the subject as you have been at the trouble to do He has also brought a present to the Queen's goddaughter as an honourable mark of her favours which are infinitely esteemed I would not however give my parchment for it since it will be an everlasting monument in the archives of Hannover and the present of the little princess will go when she is grown up into another family As for the rest I will not combat all the reasons which you produce to make me acquainted with those which the Queen has to be dissatisfied with her allies but as her Majesty entered into this war for the good of her crown and to hinder France from becoming too powerful and as her Majesty's arms have been always victorious as my lord Rivers last year spoke of nothing but war which the Queen was determined to continue with the utmost vigour and as all  those things of which you speak were then already past you must not be surprised if so sudden a change creates astonishment especially if a peace is to be concluded upon such terms as are printed in the English Gazettes If you had been willing to accept peace on those terms a great deal of blood and a great deal of the money of England and Holland might have been saved and no one is ignorant of the state of the Emperor's finances which indeed England has generously and bountifully supplied As her Majesty finds now the burden of this too heavy for her people it is not surprising that she looks out for a remedy which I heartily wish may contibute to her glory and to the good of her kingdoms and of her allies But hitherto it was always believed that the too great power of France would be prejudicial to them all and especially to England But you know this undoubtedly better than I who do not pretend to understand affairs of state With regard to those which are private they will always incline me to be with great esteem for you c"  STUART PAPERS    THOUGH the earl of Oxford made use of the zeal and even violence of the Tories to possess himself of power he was unwilling to throw himself entirely into the hands of that party by displacing all the real and supposed Whigs In the inferior departments the retainers of the former ministry still remained and the duke of Marlborough was continued at the head of the army The minister would have been extremely glad to have gained over to his views that nobleman But the latter had entered into cabals with the opposite party which he chose not to relinquish for the uncertain friendship of a man whom he had some reason to distrust The information conveyed to the ministry concerning the duke's designs induced them to dismiss him abruptly from all his offices on the thirtieth of December They knew that in conjunction with prince Eugene who was daily expected in England he was forming plans dangerous to their own power if not to the repose of the kingdom The intrigues between these two great generals and the baron de Bothmar are minutely set forth by the marquis de Torcy in his memoirs and he seems to have been well informed on the subject His relation is corroborated by several anecdotes in the correspondence of the

plain they do not intend to have any more of the same dealings with them and that a peace is certain The Portugal minister said at Somersethouse in  public that the parliament had called his master rogue and rascal but that he was abused in good company meaning the Emperor and the Dutch The Whigs croud after prince Eugene and cabal with him hourly but it can come to nothing The parliament is to go on the barrier treaty that will lay a great scene open The duke of Marlborough did not sign it but there is a letter of his that proves that he ordered my lord Townsend to sign it They say the two scored articles are that the Dutch should have all the conquered towns from Cambray to the other side for themselves and that they are to furnish England with men and ships for the loyalists of England to secure them The parliament will be judges of that design The Queen declares they did not let her read it but said it was approved of by the council so she signed it The article relating to Portugal is very dishonourable for England they agreeing to have our fleet to attend them on all occasions they thought proper for them This makes a great noise has exposed the Whigs more than all their other management and left them without excuse The birthday of the Queen the duke of Marlborough was in a chair in St James's Park with the curtains drawn the mob that believed it to be the prince Eugene huzza'd the chair but the duke modestly drew back the curtains and put himself out and with a sign shewed his dislike to the salutation The mob finding their mistake and that it was he cried out "Stop thief" which was a thorough mortification to him His daughters that day to shew their contempt of the court were in wrappinggowns at a window in St James's to see the company pass two of them and the other two drove through the Pallmall four times in the worst mobdress they could put themselves The duke was in a black suit that day and his soninlaw the duke of Montague was at court in a plain coarse red coat with a long shoulderknot in ridicule of the day but the Queen had the satisfaction to see the most splendid court that ever was and crowded more than ever by all the church nobility and gentry There was a short uproar My lord Marlborough finds his levees much thinner than they were and daily less and less The people are disgusted at him In a little time he will be odious

additional lords They say there will be fix more made The Whigs cry out at the number that was made to serve a turn and say it destroys one of the three parts of our constitution and made the Queen and lords one which ought to be two parts and the commons the third Though it is in the power of the crown the trust is betrayed when used to destroy the power of parliaments It cannot be imagined how the votes that reflected on the allies have discouraged the Whigs for it has ended all their hopes of having the war continued This news of Brasette has been an unlucky stroke for the allies The Scottish peers will sit no more they have absented themselves these five days declare the union broke and this of liberty for the churchclergy is directly against the agreement The Scots will prove

he is a friend to them though an enemy to the Statewhigs who would have ruined him and his country"  Nairne's papers D N vol iv to No  The designs and projects of the Whigs against the Tory ministry discovered and prevented at the time prince Eugene came and the duke of Marlborough was turned out of all his employments  "THE whigish faction being disappointed in the execution of all their black designs since their being turned out industriously made use of the Emperor's and Hannoverian ministers who were well prepared to break off the treaty to procure the aversion of the vulgar against a peace  The first step made towards it was that the Emperor's ministers having acquainted baron Bothmar and the whigish faction that he was well  assured the Tory ministry intended to procure a match to be made and a marriage solemnized between the Pretender's sister and the King of Sweden and that restoring the Pretender would be the consequence of such a match and that he is in the bottom of the present negociation for a peace  This was calculated for a bait to bring over the ignorant part of the commonalty on their side as Doctor Sacheverel's sermon was serviceable for the Tories upon which ensued the late change of the ministry and accordingly Bothmar was prevailed upon to present the late memorial to the Queen who surreptitiously got it printed and published against the sitting of the parliament  But finding it had not the desired effect they were resolved to leave no stone unturned and accordingly pressed prince Eugene's coming for England to lay before the Queen and parliament his master's mighty proposals viz that England should have all the West Indies and a free trade throughout all Spain and that men at his Imperial Majesty's proper charges should be employed wherever the Queen should appoint  These high proposals put them in mighty hopes of prevailing with the Queen having the house of lords already prepared the majority being Whigs but on the contrary the Queen and ministry were so averse to it that to balance the lords she made twelve new peers all of a start whereby she has established a majority of the lords as well as of the commons of her side for the peace  But her Majesty finding the faction so earnest for the prince's coming upon these occasions dispatched a messenger to Holland to prevent his coming over who missing him by reason of his having embarked before the messenger's arrival and his being detained by contrary winds for several days it was thought necessary in order to weaken his pretensions and discountenance the faction to remove the duke of Marlborough from all places of trust which sudden and unexpected change quite broke all their measures  The prince at his landing finding things in this dismal posture and foreseeing his fruitless errand would expose him to a public ridicule concerted with his party to form another plausible scheme of laying before the Queen and both houses viz  That his master had formed a new alliance with Holland Prussia Denmark Poland the Czar of Muscovy Hannover and the other princes of the Empire and all the Hans Towns for securing the protestant succession and if possible to bring his Swedish Majesty into the alliance But the ministry look upon all this to be only a design to get the management again into their own hands rather than a sincere intention of performing any better than the last treaty has been executed on the late Emperor's part and accordingly rejected it  Then little Eugene thought of another project viz To have the duke of Hannover's son brought into England wherein he is like to fail as well as in all the rest  But I must not omit how the party have premeditated and concerted the manner of the reception of this little emissary  First to render him the more popular and his errand the more plausible he was to be met by several thousands on horseback at his landing and conducted with great acclamations and huzzas through the city where great illuminations and ringing of bells was to be made and the mob to cry out No peace No peace and then great and splendid entertainments were to be made by subscription for him All which fine doings were timely prevented by the vigilance of the ministry who were truly apprized of it  Prince Eugene's nephew is dead of the small pox  Here is a Flemish that has given articles to the Queen my lord keeper lord treasurer and lord president of the council against my lord Marlborough what will be proved is not yet known  The last paragraph is in the same hand which wrote Mrs White's letter The rest of the paper is a copy in an unknown hand  "  The following curious petition of the generality of Ghent is probably meant by the writer in the last paragraph of the preceding paper  A copy communicated to the Editor  To her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain  "THE deputation of the city of Ghent in Flanders representing the generality of that province cast themselves at your Majesty's feet and with all respect and submission set forth That the glorious battle of Ramillies which was fought by the troops of her High Allies against the French had given us hopes of being freed from their tyranny Whereas general Cadogan whom your Majesty was pleased to appoint in the room of Mr Stepney for the general government and my lord duke persons who tread under foot the glory of your Majesty and of all the English nation in that in the year at the taking of the city of Ghent they immediately made an agreement with the members of that province promising them their protection and continuance of it notwithstanding they had served the enemy the French which they performed and thereby reaped the benefit of the sweat and blood of the poor provinces of Flanders my lord duke having got six thousand pistoles and general Cadogan one thousand in specie  After a regulation was forthwith framed for the better direction of the said province signed by the said lord duke and the deputies of the States of Holland the th October but the same being to the prejudice of those persons who were in offices and whose perquisites were thereby somewhat restrained they entreated the said lord duke and Cadogan to inhibit the same which was likewise granted them whereby Cadogan got for himself gilders out of the said poor and exhausted province which has been for so many years the feat of war and supplied with bad directors who have made themselves rich as Croesus and entirely impoverished the province  The consequence which befel the High Allies by those infamous and contributionthirsty thieves the lord duke and Cadogan in their causing the aforesaid persons to be continued in their employments namely in the magistracy was that in the year they contrived and accomplished the betraying the towns of Ghent and Bruges the army of the High Allies being thereby brought in the greatest danger of perishing all at once My lord duke and Cadogan whether they had a hand in it or not agreed anew with the said persons in offices to procure for them a general pardon which my lord duke promised to obtain by your Majesty as it also happened notwithstanding that the said lord duke and  Cadogan were fully informed and knew themselves the secret correspondence of our governors with the generals and ministers of the enemy as also the persons who contributed thereto and for the said general pardon the first got two hundred thousand gilders and the latter ten thousand pistoles all out of the remainder of the revenues of the said ruined province of Flanders  The aforesaid members or governors of the said province have not long since given to the said Cadogan the sum of five thousand pistoles upon his promise that they should be continued in their employments which sum he has received at Brussels in the house of the Sieur Vandergote one of the council of state his great friend besides other gentlemen of the said council who are enemies of the High Allies and protectors of their enemies and that was done at the time that our convoy was beaten between Ghent and Courtray in the parish of St Eloyvive when instead of furthering the service of the war he preferred his own interest  Over and above the several sums which he and my lord duke have otherwise exacted from our poor province we shall allege no other for shortness sake this serving only to observe that they have continued such members in the magistracy of Ghent and Bruges notwithstanding they had served the French before and had contrived and accomplished the betraying of the said towns only thereby to continue to feed their avarice by extortions from the poor province that those persons might not discover to your Majesty and parliament their thieveries  The matter is come to that pitch that her Majesty having no opinion of the conduct of those two moneythirsty persons the duke and Cadogan they are capable to induce the aforesaid members to give attestations of their good behaviour in having reaped no profits from this province but it is hoped that your Majesty and the parliament will have no regard to them it being certain that one thief will not willingly discover another that is to say that the said lord duke and Cadogan who have procured to the said directors of our province the amnesty concerning the said treachery will easily be induced to excuse those that protected them and to discover the truth of what is above mentioned that her Majesty will please to cause an inquiry to be made into the conduct and roguery of those two persons during the war in the Netherlands by  such members of the new parliament as have been employed under them as officers in her Majesty's service  We prostrate ourselves at your Majesty's feet with all humility that your Majesty will be pleased to reflect on the premises and consider the miserable condition in which our aforesaid province is involved by this long war and to deliver and free us of the said lord duke and Cadogan two professed thieves to our province and the reputation of your Majesty and the whole English nation who are pleased to pay their troops and officers so largely with their own money and never permitted that any of their chief officers as these two should enrich themselves so unreasonably with the money of our poor country much less to protect such persons as shewed their affection entirely for the French and still correspond with them There is so much of this that all the favours they have shewed to the enemy would be sufficient to fill a book the sending of money to sustain the war against us being one of their least favours  We further pray your Majesty to send another plenipotentiary to our government with express orders to turn out all such persons in the magistracy who have served the enemy and to put in their room such persons who are fit to serve your Majesty and to ease our poor province As for secretary Laws like masters like men of whom no good testimony can likewise be given Wherefore we pray likewise your Majesty to appoint another in his room and in so doing your Majesty will find plainly more prosperity in your arms restore the reputation of the nation and further have the blessing of God Almighty for having punished the bad for which all superiors are ordained And in case your Majesty is not pleased to appoint other ministers in the room of Cadogan and Laws as also my lord duke who will better promote the glory of your Majesty and the reputation of the parliament and English nations who must immediately change the respective magistrates as is usual every year according to the customs and privileges of the country we shall still be governed by and remain under traitors to your Majesty and the High Allies who were serviceable to the enemy and were put into those employments and have now continued in them for four years together which if not remedied we should be happier to be governed by Turks than by that British thief Cadogan Relying on the protection of your Majesty  and hoping for the same we remain with the utmost respect c c"  Nairne's Papers vol ix to p  Letters from Nairne to Abram and Berry from the th to  the st February  Nairne wrote to Abram

but it is believed our plenipotentiaries have instructions not to have any such guarantees which would limit the people of England for hereafter in case of necessity they must ask all the allies leave

of or beginning of Queen Anne sent for lord Somers and told him as they were alone she having an opinion of his judgment and impartiality desired him to tell her his opinion of the Duke of Marlborough He said he would and told her that he was the worst man that God Almighty ever made that his ambition was boundless and his avarice insatiable and that he had neither honour nor conscience to restrain him from any wicked attempt even against her person as well as against his country c Somers as the Queen was weary of the dss expected to be made first minister but was baulked The Queen had expressed herself advantageously of his honour integrity and capacity During the debates about the peace in opposition to it M de Torcy acquainted lord Oxford that after the Duke of Marlborough had hindered the peace of when it should have been made he had treated with the French court to make them one and was to have two millions of crowns for it This would have been done but for M Chamillard a weak minister who during the siege of Lisle came to Valenciennes sent the duke of Marlborough word that he expected he would raise the siege of Lisle as a proof of his sincerity in the peace they had treated and settled The duke of Marlborough was angry and wrote to the duke of Berwick that there was an end of the affair and he would have nothing more to do with the treaty  When M de Torcy discovered this the King of France allowed lord Oxford to make use of it to send the duke of Marlborough abroad but insisted that his life should not be touched and so it was They had a meeting at Thomas Harley's house in James street Westminster Oxford coming to the street door in his coach the duke of Marlborough in a chair to the garden door opening into the park it was then resolved  that the duke of Marlborough should go abroad Prince Eugene and lord Wharton both said on the occasion that the duke of Marlborough had not a clear conscience or he would not have submitted to that step  Several measures were proposed to oppose the peace and several schemes sent to Vienna some for seizing the Queen others for seizing the ministry and one for assassinating Oxford and Bolingbroke in their chairs Prince Eugene wrote about this last to count Zinzendorff then at the Hague who wrote in answer that such measures were extremely hazardous and scarce to be undertaken but if this was resolved on he advised prince Eugene to come over to Holland before it was executed  Among other schemes one was for the duke of Marlborough by his power as general to assemble or men at an hour in different squares of Westminster and to seize St James's This was discovered and lord Oxford sent to Mr Lewis to come immediately to the office that morning his presence being necessary by ten o'clock When he came he found the lord chancellor and all the lords of council there The business was to supersede the duke of Marlborough's commission as general under the broad seal There had been before an order under the privy seal sent him not to act more as general but his commission being under the great seal could not be superseded but by a revocation under the great seal When this was done the duke of Marlborough would not act so against law as to rendezvous the men he was not made for hazards  He said the duke of Marlborough's quitting the opposition to the peace had ruined his credit at Hannover and at the Hague King George was resolved to make no alteration in ministry but  l  given to Bothmar at the Hope caused the duke of Marlborough's apology to to be accepted and all Queen Anne's ministers to be turned out  Erasinus Lewis was under secretary to the Earl of Oxford He is often mentioned by doctor Swift in his letters Swift charges prince Eugene with the designs mentioned in the two last articles  History of the four last years of Queen Anne p of vol xvi  but bishop Burnet  History of his own times vol iv  and the Whig writers speak of him in a very different manner  The Marquis de Torcy relates in his Memoirs that he had his master's orders to offer four millions of livres to the duke of Marlborough at the Hague in if he employed his interest in contributing to a peace  vol i p  His Majesty's words are  "I don't in the least question but you avail yourself of the opportunities you have of seeing the duke of Marlborough to let him know that I have been informed of the steps he has taken to hinder the progress of the conferences of peace and even to break them off entirely that I had been the more surprised thereat as I had reason to believe from the assurances he had already given that he was willing to contribute to this end that I should be glad his conduct was such as to deserve the reward I have promised him and in order that you may be able to come to a clearer explication I am willing you should give him a positive assurance that I willIn short I am willing you should offer the duke of Marlborough four millions should he enable me to keep Naples and Sicily for the King my grandson and to preserve Dunkirk with its fortifications and harbour and Strasburg and Landau in the manner above explained or even the same sum were Sicily to be excepted out of this last article  Ibid p  "  De Torcy does not tell what answer the duke of Marlborough made to these offers  "At the same time news came that the duchess of Marlborough first lady of the bedchamber to the Queen of England was disgraced The duke of Marlborough himself gave notice of it to his nephew the duke of Berwick  Ibid vol ii p  "  "  A Letter signed Charles Johnson and

Hackett  "To bid him forward Abram's and keep the two former for Sanderson by him till further orders"  Mr Menzies so often exhibited under the feigned name of Abram is the Scotch gentleman mentioned by Monsieur Menager in the account of his secret negociations in England  Menager having signed the preliminary articles of a separate treaty between France and Britain employed the time he staid afterwards in London in attempting according to his instructions to render some service to the court of St Germains and introduced the subject in a conversation with Mr St John They foresaw that the King of France would be obliged in the ensuing treaty  "not so much to abandon the chevalier as to acknowledge the succession of the crown in the house of Hannover as it was mentioned in the second preliminary  Minute of Monsicur Menager's negociation  "  Menager proposed that a secret article should be made by the Queen to disengage the King from all the obligations of such agreements upon such subsequent occasions as might happen and a declaration from her Majesty that all the engagements the King should enter into in the treaty of peace should be so understood by the Queen St John was afraid the Queen would not sign such a declaration but he thought she would declare by word of mouth that she would be satisfied to understand the treaty in such a manner and that whenever she disengaged the King from it the obligation on him as to the recognition of the succession should cease Bolingbroke mentioned this proposal to the Queen and with her consent introduced Menager to Mrs Masham that he might learn her Majesty's intentions from that lady as he himself did not choose to meddle further in the affair  Two points were agreed upon between Menager and Mrs Masham First  "that for the satisfaction of the people at home and the allies abroad the King should be required in the Queen's name to abandon her brother and his interest on pretence of adhering to the succession as it was now established"  d  "That nevertheless this seeming to abandon the said interest was to be so understood that the King should not be obliged in case of her Majesty's decease not to use his endeavours for the placing the said prince on his father's throne to which he had an undoubted right  Ibid p  "  Mrs Masham told him  "that it was the present unhappiness of the Queen to possess the throne of her brother which she had no other claim to than what the political measures of the state had made legal and in a sort necessary which however she believed gave her Majesty oftentimes secret uneasiness that this was not all the misfortune but that by the same necessity of state she was obliged not only against her disposition but even against her principles to further and promote the continuance of the usurpation not only beyond her own life but for ever That I might be sure under such circumstances it would be an inexpressible satisfaction to her Majesty to see herself delivered from the fatal necessity of doing so much wrong and if it could be possible with safety to the religion and liberties of her subjects to have her brother restored to his right at least after her decease if it could not be done before"  "That it was true the Queen did not see through this and it seemed next to impossible  "the rage and irreconcilable aversion of the greatest part of the common people to her brother being grown to such a height"  nay she said the Queen found it would be impossible to enter upon any treaty of peace or so much as to let the people hear of putting an end to the war without entering into the strongest engagements possible for the confirming the succession in the house of Hannover  "a thing that I am sure says she is all our aversions"  and we have no retreat but to his most Christian Majesty in hopes of his ordering things so at this treaty that he may be at liberty to support and assist in the work whenever an opportunity should present itself that to this end the plenipotentiaries from hence  "though there was no communicating any thing to them by way of confidence"  should be instructed not to insist upon things more than necessity obliged and  "some reserves sure" says she "may be made to leave room for justice to take place in time to come  Minute of Monsieur Menager's negociation  p    "  Menager upon his arrival at Utrecht where he acted as one of the plenipotentiaries from France found that the British ministers had not received the private instructions which lady Masham gave him reason to expect would be sent to them and he afterwards discovered that the agents of the court of St Germains had made the concerns of the chevalier the subject of a private negociation with the ministry in  England These agents were obliged at last to write to the King of France  "in plain terms that the ministry in England were men of no honour that they had held them in suspense for a long time and that now they not only did not come to the point with them but declined any conversation on the subject only said in general that a certain person would be sent over to Utrecht who should discourse by word of mouth freely and should settle that affair so as should be agreeable to all parties  Minute of Monsieur Menager's negociation  p    "  Lady Masham in a letter to Menager dated St James's March says  "I take it for granted that they the court of St Germains are fallen into the hands of my Lord Treasurer he loves a secret and is famous for making intricacies where there is a sterility of intrigues and no less renowned for causing every thing of such a nature to miscarry If their assurances are from him I doubt not he values himself upon having deceived them and if the person to be sent to Utrecht comes from him I dare promise you that when he comes there he wants his instructions  Ibid p  "  Menager who hated all the agents of the court of St Germains and was equally hated by them says that  "all this was owing to the impatience and jealousy of the court of St Germains who though the King had agents of his own in London who perhaps did their utmost yet they at St Germains being uneasy could not refrain sending a secret embassy themselves This it seems was a Scotchman who pretended great interest with a Scotch lord who was an officer of state in England but either the messenger failed in the interest he pretended to have or the Scotch nobleman failed in what he promised to do for him seeing the sum of his negociation was briefly this that after a long stay he performed only there two notable exploits viz first that he spent a great deal of their money and secondly that he ruined and exposed the business which he was entrusted with and at last came away with nothing but an empty promise from the said Scotch lord that a person should be sent over to negociate that matter with the French and British ministers together  Ibid p  "  Menager had strong prejudices against the earl of Middleton He gives the postscript of a letter he wrote to lady Masham  "A Scotchman  from St Germains and a Scotchman in your court have been the agents to deceive one another and to abuse their masters As to the inquiring who the secret has remained with they confess now at St Germains that it has really remained with no body for so ill a choice did they make of their agent that he has not only exposed his errand but his employer and our people in London are very free to send word hither how ill he has acquitted himself though by the way I must observe that this was not done till after they had been amused with the persuasions of this person to believe things were in a good train when they were indeed in hands who intended nothing less than to perform what was proposed  Minute of Monsieur Menager's negociation  p  "  Menager's account of this negociation appeared so extraordinary that it hath hitherto met with little credit from the public but it will be found to coincide with what relates to Menzies under the borrowed name of Abram in Nairne's letters and with the account which the well known John Plunket gives of his own intrigues He acknowledges that he allowed himself to be

might let him enjoy his pretensions descended to him by birthright laboured to compass to good a work and in order thereunto he provided as follows  First by founding Mr Simson and his associates for several months together not perceiving in them a real disposition for an agreement with Mr Maine King of France with an inclination to do justice to Mr  Jenkins the King with safety to themselves but the current running too strong against them for such an attempt at that time they resolved to take a year or two's time to stem it though they knew it would redound to the prejudice of the sister and all her tenants the said Rogers Plunket conceiving they wanted but a plausible handle to justify such proceedings resolved to procure them one if possible  Accordingly being intimate as well with Mr Goodman as with all those that were entrusted by him he became master of all their secrets and of the methods that were taken to prevent the sister from entering into any accommodation with Mr Maine King of France in order to do Mr Jenkins the King justice and produced the vouchers from time to time to Mr Simson whereof he got as many as were sufficient to justify the sister's P Anne making a separate agreement with Mr Maine King of France Upon which she took courage and made a firm resolution to treat with him at all hazards whereupon Rogers Plunket was pitched upon as an indifferent man to deliver a message to Mr Maine the King of France to that purpose But upon second thoughts he being found more useful and capable of rendering further service here Mr Simson sent another that was a creature of his own but in the meantime Mr Maine the King of France sent hither one Mr Ciprian in order to try the sister princess Anne and Mr Simson's pulses which Mr Rogers Plunket communicated to Mr Simson wherewith he seemed to be wellpleased whereby a true understanding was settled between them which has been the foundation of the present agreement between them  Mr Williams's master prince Eugene's having a dark notion of the matters and conceiving them to be much to his detriment came hither by the instigation of the Wylens Whigs in order to frustate and render all abortive cost what it would wherein he was so desperate as to form a design of laying violent hands on the sister rather than he should be disappointed of his ends but Mr Rogers Plunket being vigilant upon this occasion found means to discover all his intrigues and accordingly communicated the same from time to time to Mr Simson and his associates which put the sister princess Anne upon a resolution of closing immediately with Mr Maine the King of France and keeping a good correspondence with him for the future in order to do Mr  Jenkins the King justice upon occasion whereby it is in Mr Maine's King of France's power to give the rest of his adversaries what terms he pleases about which we shall not dispute much with him  Mr Rogers Plunket desires you would be pleased to meet him at Rotterdam where

decyphered by Sir William Ellis  The measures taken to restore the Pretender  SIR  May  "YOUR last letter has given me a great deal of concern because I do believe it had been of great consequence to the cause in Chancery that you should have settled the accounts with Mr Rogers He could have told you what the best counsellors had said to him upon his laying the merits of the cause before them Mr Tom West lord Mulgrave who is a friend to Mr Jenkins the King told Mr Roger Plunket that what he had informed him of would do Mrs Bess Smith England the greatest service that had been done her ever since the suit began which has been these twenty odd years and Mrs Bess Smith England has very nobly rewarded him for that service for it has discovered  covered Mr Sandys's Hannover's practises and laid them open which would have ruined Mrs Dibby princess Anne who abhors him now Mr Rogers Plunket did believe that young man Mr Sheridan was sent by Mr Peregrine Ferguson to Mr Jenkins the King because Mr Peregrine Ferguson did acquaint Mr Tom West L Mul of Mr Rogers's business unknown to Mr Rogers for he had taken measures to have it laid before the friends in Mr Medlicot's family the parliament and the pleading first council cab coun both at a time when he found Mr Hans Harley concealed all from them but when Mr Peregrine Ferguson had taken that way Rogers was satisfied though he was not privy to the doing it for it had the end he wished and in a little time it will be laid before Mr Medlicote himself the parliament though he is very tender in openly exposing Mr Sandys Hannover because of the tenants love to him yet but all the others that are injointly with him will be openly exposed which will justify Mrs Bess Smith England acting apart from them a greater service could not be done to Mr St John the King than this has been Mr Tom West lord M has been informed that Mr Wealy of the country of Mr Peregrine the Scots Whigs has sent to Mr Sandys Hannover to assist him against Mr Carres Church of England and desired him to come to them therefore now Mr Carres has no better way than by Mr Jenkins the King to do himself justice and that is what he is resolved on But the many difficulties he must go through is what they are labouring under because of the jointure Mrs Dian Johns princess Anne has upon the estate and after her death it will be too late because of the entail that will then take place Mr Peregrine would have had Mr Rogers to have let him have managed it to have a friend of his to have come to him to settle the accounts and said Mr James Staff Mr Stafford would he believed come himself to settle the accounts with Mr Rogers Plunket but he having given Mrs White direction to write to you he would not alter that so that he will be disappointed extremely because for many reasons he cannot do it by writing at a distance besides you may guess how impossible it is to direct you by writing all the particulars of what he would let you understand for he knows a great deal of the affairs of the entailed estate He said he did not acquaint the young man Mr Sheridan of  any thing not believing him a proper person but Mr Peregrine having done that to Mr Tom West lord Mulgrave he believed by the young man's going of a sudden then away he had sent him but Mr Rogers has no patron cut paper and cannot get the work done any other way effectually so you will not have the work I fear he is what I told you expecting Mr Sam Hamey Sir William Ellis he will write to him Mrs White gave him a direction how to write He poor man is in danger in that ill air considering his weakly constitution so he will stay as little a time as he can but he has much to do being fully apprized of his business from the first hands I believe there could be nothing of greater use in the cause than your sending this account with him but since that you say cannot be done pray write to him and let him know the reason and tell him how you think it ought to be done Direct for Mr Rogers as you send Mrs White's to be delivered to him by Mr Hacket so you and he must do it the best way you can the term is now and it will be a great damage to those you value most not to know how to instruct the counsel Your friend Mr Matthews tells me that he has writ to you He is now in Mr Medlecot's family Scotch parliament and that more than half of those children wish us well as he does the prosperity of your cousin St John the King but they were deceived in this last affair in relation to Mr Jenkins the King by Mr Hans Mr Harley and hate him heartily for it But you know they must take no notice of it but are resolved to make what reparation they can and as soon as they can do it Mr Peregrine is ordered to receive  l  for laying the business of Mr Rogers before the

Nairne's Papers D N vol iv to  The blotted Scroll of a Letter from prince Eugene probably to Count Zinzendorff mentioned in the preceding to Mr Watson  He gives an account of his intrigues in England  Translation  London  February th  "I Don't imagine I shall be able to leave London as soon as I proposed The Whigs continue always to sow the feeds of division by forming new projects for destroying entirely if possible the party now in power and they flatter themselves much to accomplish this the more easily that the treasurer who is at the head of it is universally hated that is to say by both parties consequently no one will regret him It is for this reason they urge me to stay for some time longer in order to see what their projects will come to I shewed them again that they would have the same success with the former and that my stay would be of no advantage to them as my presence serves only to four the minds of the ministry and in order to disengage myself the more from them I communicated to them the sentiments of the Grand Pensionary upon the clause which I sent to you in my dispatches of the th and th of January They answered me abruptly and among the rest the Duke  of Marlborough that the grand Pensionary had changed his sentiments very soon since he began to be apprehensive of disobliging a handful of factious members in the house of commons and to be afraid of a ministry who are pensioners of France and consequently enemies to the common cause and will continue so as long as they subsist It seems to me that the States have already forgot that they formerly resisted France and England at once and if I am not mistaken they will find themselves soon in the same necessity  "Yes" says baron Bothmar "of sending thither the prince of Hannover as they sent the prince of Orange to deliver the nation and to prevent the ruin of the common cause"  They urged me instantly to send you the following particulars to be added to those which I sent you in my dispatches of and of January and to make up a memorial of them to be printed there first as it might then be printed here without any suspicion  The Queen of England upon her accession to the crown declared the following particulars  That trade being the support of the nation and she having religion so much at heart had made no difficulty of engaging in this war though the nation was then in debt being well convinced that she could not be secure upon the throne while Spain was in the possession of the house of Bourbon and she had engaged herself deeper in this war than she had at first proposed to the great detriment of her kingdoms  But the measures of the present ministry sufficiently shew that they were not hearty in the cause from the beginning and that the most discerning see very well that every thing tends to a separate peace and to pave the way more easily for her brother I told them that appeared very probable but that the Pensionary would start the same objections as baron Bothmar did not think proper to undertake such a delicate affair without communicating it to his master and that it is now too late to produce any great effect as the people in England were already biassed by the resolutions of the house of commons but the junto made the following answer  "by this method of proceeding we shall never succeed for you made the same objection to the loans which we had proposed from the bank and from rich merchants by engaging the revenue of the kingdom of Hungary and other hereditary dominions and by that means the Emperor would find himself in a condition jointly  with the Statesgeneral of besieging a town and at the same time taking the field by which of consequence he would put an end to the cessation of arms and infallibly break up the conferences at Utrecht and dispose the people to believe all the projects that might be formed I imagine we have still time enough to insert this in the memorial"  I answered them that we were foolishly employed in building the tower of Babel for there are not three among you or us of the same sentiment Sometimes you would choose to have the prince of Hannover and sometimes you would not and I see that the greatest number of you are for an aristocracy and what vexes me most is that you have obliged the Emperor to make demands from the greatest part of which he will be obliged to

more frivolous than to go about to prove what carries a clear evidence along with it  Narine wrote in the margin "paper in my lord's hand sent to Mrs Watson for the doctor June " p  A mathematician would be laughed at that should undertake to demonstrate that two and two make four and in doubtful cases it is sufficient to prove the fact and learned men must decide  "What is more evident than that Crassus Hannover with the Pedlars the Dutch and the Tartars Whigs have declared against Thomas Queen Anne and his lawyers ministry and that there is no means to ward that blow but by doing justice to Richard Pretender One must want both sense and manners to mistrust such eminent persons and it would be as absurd to instruct them in the ways and means of managing a matter so necessary for their own security and the advantage of their pupil Canaan As for instance would it not be a strange presumption to tell them that delays are dangerous that if Thomas Queen Anne should die whom God preserve Crassus Hannover must certainly get possession because the decrees made in his favour though unjust could never in that case be reversed That Richard is a person of too much spirit to submit but would immediately appear armed with equity and supported by many good friends and relations to assert his right so that the estate in debate would be utterly ruined and the present lawyers ministry could not escape the rage of Tartars Whigs and that though Croesus's Marlborough's case be not so desperate yet it cannot be doubted but he wishes he had made better use of his time  That the surest way to prevent these miseries is for Thomas Queen to send a letter of attorney treaty to his brother Richard Pretender and when that is signed to call him home immediately when the troops parliament are dispersed in their respective quarters that this merry meeting must be at Sir Roger's London to make it more solemn and secure by surprising the Tartars Whigs in their head quarters by a good guard of Janisaries Tories that those who never had a good thought of Richard Pretender would crowd to embrace him and tell him as they did his uncle that it is the happy day they all wished for  that when the troops parliament were assembled and the brothers should appear together they no doubt would not only applaud what had been done but would make a secure title to the estate that it would be dangerous to begin with the troops for besides the case of mortality already mentioned they are fickle and humoursome and even the Janisaries themselves are jealous of one another  That there is more prudence and as much courage shown in preventing danger than by running into it many great occasions have been lost by too much caution whereas by stealing a march the secret is kept and the enemy found unprepared that for that end and purpose Richard Pretender should be as advantageously posted as can be to prevent Crassus Hannover in case of the worst  These considerations and many more

Middleton    He gives in this letter an account of a conversation with Queen Anne The state of affairs in England with respect to the Pretender's restoration The sentiments and intentions of the Queen and of her Ministry  July  "I Have considered very seriously the subject of your last letter and the more I reflect upon it the more diffident I find myself not only from the importance of the subject itself so nearly concerning the welfare of my nephew the King's affairs for which I have the tenderest  concern  as I truly love him and design him my heir notwithstanding the difference of religion but also from the great difficulty of giving an opinion where I do not well understand the law Yet that I may leave nothing undone I must say it is my opinion that the chief matter is to regain my brother's princess Anne's good liking I shall therefore mention such steps as I think Harry the King may best take to please his uncle princess Anne and at the same time get the good will of the old servants and tenants who I find in general much better inclined to Harry the King than to his cousin Hannover You know the first dislike my brother princess Anne took was upon Harry's the King's changing his religion though as I have often told him it was no more than he might expect from the manner of sending him abroad for I did not think so very young a man indeed you know he was a very boy when he went should be trusted altogether to his own conduct and the event hath shewn my fears were not in vain Yet my brother princess Anne will not so much as own any imprudence far less any fault as I think it in this management and whenever I touch upon this string I can very seldom get any other answer than  "You see he doth not make the least step to oblige me I have no reason to think he values me or my estate and therefore I am resolved to give it to Dick Hannover"  Once indeed I was observing to him that my cousin Richard Hannover frequently abused his best servants that he often shewed very little respect for himself that he seemed to me by his behaviour to think it not in his power to alter the will he had made and that underhand he gave him all the obstructions he could in the management of his estate for no other reason that I could see but because he could not put what servants he had a mind about him that for my part I should not think it safe to have servants near me recommended by a person of Dick's Hannover's temper and that Harry the King never offered anything like this I am sensible this made a very great impression on my brother princess Anne for he replied very hastily  "What wouldst have me do Jack lord Mulgrave you know as the law stands a Papist cannot inherit and therefore should I alter my will it would be to no purpose the law would give it all to Dick Hannovr and therefore I had better do that with a good grace that I cannot help"  I told him then I believed Dick Hannover himself was no better than a Papist  that I had good grounds to suspect him for I never saw him at church in my life nor did I ever hear he went thither and certainly a Papist was better than one of no religion at all I then said that I had been told that by deeds of trust and by other devices the lawyers often found means to evade the act of parliament and I do not doubt but if he would give good fees and good encouragement the law would speak whatever he would have it that the lawyers never suffered an act to be made without a loophole to creep out at and I believed it was so in this case Besides brother said I you know Dick hath not the reputation of being the best husband in the world but added I then this his wife's behaviour too well excuseth yet at the same time give me leave to tell you brother this doth not so much commend your settlement since it is plain you have no certainty that Dick's children are his own This made him very uneasy and he said upon it  "you must not believe all that is reported upon that subject However be that as it may I do not see how I can undo what I myself have done and done in such a manner Harry the King may thank himself for it He knows I always loved him better than Dick Hannover"  I could not think it proper to press further at this time but rather chose to leave him to his own reflections on what had passed and in the mean time I will consult some good lawyers what can best be done in such a case I am convinced that if Harry the King would return to the church of England all would be easy nay for what I know if he would but barely give hopes he would do so my brother princess Anne would do all he can to leave him his estate I am satisfied he hates Dick Hannover and loves Harry the King now rather better than ever  I was in the country about a month since and could not but be pleased to see how almost all the tenants caressed me on my conscience it was for Harry's the King's sake whose part they know I always take Old Tom Simmonds lord Mulgrave told me a thousand stories of Dick Hannover and swore when his lease was up that he would not renew again if Dick Hannover had the estate Ah Master said he if Master Harry the King was not a Papist we would soon give Mr Richard Hannover his bellyfull of law we would all turn tenants to Mr Harry the King and see whether Mr Richard's Hannover's annuities would hold out against such an estate i'faith he should have  enough of law before he should set a foot here You certainly remember old Tom lord Mulgrave he is worth at least  l  which he hath got by his own industry and I verily believe he speaks the hearts and minds of his fellows  By what is above you will pretty plainly perceive my lord Mulgrave's opinion and I would have Harry the King remember he is not the first of his family who have thought a good estate worth changing an opinion for and ten thousand pounds a year is a pretty thing for a young fellow to play withal but if his scruples are so very strong that he cannot go this length let him endeavour to try to make his uncle princess Anne believe at least that he is in himself desirous to come back but is ashamed left the world should think he changes his religion for an estate which he will hardly get quietly if at all without it Pray tell him this in the strongest terms and that I myself lord Mulgrave though my fondness makes me overlook it would be very glad that he was of my opinion much more he may well think is expected by my brother princess Anne who is and ever was very obstinate in all his opinions if therefore Harry the King can prevail upon himself to do as much on his side as I will do on mine I by no means despair of persuading my brother princess Anne to consent to let him go live on the estate in Yorkshire Scotland where he hath most friends and when he is once there the rest will surely follow at my brother's princess Anne's death who I must tell you by the bye notwithstanding his care to hide it I can perceive to be so infirm that it well behoves Harry the King to be speedy in his resolutions left Dick Hannover should in that case get into possession before him which by the help of God he shall never do at least without a lawsuit but then Harry the King must join or nothing effectual can be hoped for Pray give him my kind love and desire him carefully to consider his old uncle's advice and to take this with him that I find he can hardly depend upon the tenants assistance whilst he continues the opinion he is of and that whoever tells him the contrary deceives him my assistance and firm friendship he may be most sure of at all events and in all circumstances Tell him likewise and I have pretty good means to know it that my brother princess Anne and his best servants are now so angry at Dick's Hannover's late insolence that if Harry the King will but put it in their power to help him they will  do all they can for him and I do not know but my brother princess Anne may go so far as try his interest to get an act of parliament to settle the estate on him which in my conscience he hath friends enow to obtain if he will go heartily about it Adieu Love me as I do you"  Nairne's Papers D N vol iv to No  Two letters

for though Plessington the King will never comply with the limitation above mentioned yet when a rich and numerous family are  turned out of doors  and the house left empty it will be much easier to

to all Edward's England family but most especially to Cary church of England than ever Harper Hannover can be It is natural enough for Cary church of England to wish Plessington the King would marry in his family but it can never be thought reasonable or friendly to press him to that marriage For any thing of that nature that is either done or may seem to be done by force or interest can never have that good effect that is proposed of mutual union and confidence and therefore I can hardly believe that any that wish Plessington truly well will ever press him either upon marriage or upon parting with his friend Cotton Catholic R who is so harmless a creature that he has neither power nor intention to disturb in the least any of Cary's family church of England for if Plessington should comply with any such proposal at this juncture of time it would only serve to lessen his credit even with those that require it of him for if they will not trust his word now when they see nothing but firmness integrity honour and sincerity in him they'll certainly have much less reason to trust him when they see him turn away so slightly a poor friend that he has been bred up with for they'll either think he is very weak or very insincere and in either of these cases they'll have reason not only to distrust him more than they do now but even to despise him But I hope Young princess Anne

Bothmar who had come over with the duke of Marlborough on the th of November to deliver a long memorial to the ministry It was published in the Daily Courant of the th of December and gave great satisfaction to the Whigs but very great offence to the Tories and the ministry charged Bothmar with espousing a party and intermeddling very unseasonably in the affairs of Britain Dr Swift throws some light on this subject in his History of the four last years of Queen Anne  "It was the misfortune of his Electoral Highness" says their confident and advocate "to be very ill served by Mons Bothmar his envoy here who assisted at all the factious meetings of the discontented party and deceived his master by a false representation of the kingdom drawn from the opinion of those to whom he confined his conversation There was likewise at the Elector's court a little Frenchman without merit or consequence called Robithan who by the assistance and encouragement of the last ministry had insinuated himself into some degree of that prince's favour which he used in giving his master the worst impressions he was able of those whom the Queen employed in her service insinuating that the present ministers were not in the interest of his Highness's family that their views were towards the Pretender that they were making an insecure and dishonourable peace that the weight of the nation was against them and that it was impossible for them to preserve much longer their credit or power"  It is certain the Elector who had hitherto affected to be a friend to both sides or at least to be attached to neither of the parties which divided the nation discovered different sentiments this year and might be considered as at the head of one of them The ministry sent over in the beginning of the year Mr Thomas Harley a cousin of the earl of Oxford accompanied by Mr St John brother to the secretary in order to remove whatever prejudices might have been infused into his Highness against their proceedings and to persuade him to come into their measures Mr Harley staid long in Holland and did not arrive in Hannover until the th of July  The Queen in her speech to both houses on the th of June expressed herself in this manner  "The assuring the protestant succession as by law established in the house of Hannover to these kingdoms being what I have nearest at heart particular care is taken not only to have that acknowledged in the strongest terms but to have an additional security by the removal of that person out of the dominions of France who has pretended to disturb this settlement"  But neither Mr Thomas Harley's declarations and remonstrances to the Elector nor the Queen's assurances to her parliament nor the professions of attachment contained in the prime minister's letters could reconcile his Highness to the measures which were pursued in Britain or persuade him that the ministry were well affected to the succession in his family He was particularly alarmed by a resolution of the commons against the Barrier treaty whereby they declare that under pretext of securing the protestant succession to the crown and a barrier to the States many articles had been inserted in the treaty destructive to the commerce of Great Britain and dishonourable to her Majesty When Mr Hampden moved that an address should be presented to the Queen that she would be pleased to give particular instructions to her plenipotentiaries that in the conclusion of the treaty of peace the several powers in alliance with her Majesty might be guarantees to the protestant succession to the crown of these realms as settled by act of parliament in the illustrious house of Hannover the house rejected his motion and resolved that they had such an entire confidence in the repeated declarations her Majesty had been pleased to make of her concern for assuring to these kingdoms the protestant succession as by law established that they could  never doubt her taking the proper measures for the security thereof  This resolution of the commons increased the Elector's suspicions of the ministry  The baron de Bothmar had returned to be the Elector's envoy in Holland and his plenipotentiary at the treaty now negociating at Utrecht The baron de Grote was sent in November to be his envoy extraordinary in Great Britain Bothmar Grote and Bernsdorff president of the

January d  "I Have from post to post put off writing to your Royal Highness still hoping for something agreeable to fill my letter and make it worth your reading At last I imagined the opening of the parliament would have furnished me with something I might have enlarged upon but the violence of their proceedings on one side and t'other makes a man as your Royal Highness knows me to be not partial of either party not well know what to write especially since they write me from London that Mons Bothmar has now declared himself of the Whigparty so that my finding fault on that side would be opposing the sentiments of your court and when one has not the liberty to find fault on both sides when they give occasion one can't with half the pleasure turn one's pen when it is confined only against one side One is not at liberty they tell me now to remember the villany of a party who cut off your royal ancestor's head  His lordship though a master of diction was but an ordinary genealogist Charles I was Sophia's uncle and not her ancestor  nor to remember amongst others their actions that when they were in power they acted contrary to your illustrious house and when the heads of them were pressed by wellwishers to it to settle some distinguishing allowance on your next successor they rejected it with an insolence unbecoming them nor when it was thought  by an act they should have made provision for their speedy coming after the demise of the Queen they found out on the contrary an expedient to lay the foundation of a republic by investing by act of parliament the sovereign power in certain places of which they were themselves masters and by their behaviour thought to have kept for life all this instead of making it hightreason for any one to do any act of sovereignty between the demise of the Queen and the coming over of the successor as was proposed by some of the Tory party who to my knowledge and as I'm an honest man and a Christian designed to have voted an allowance fit for the present maintainance of a successor and told me when I was in England they were sure of the Queen's consent I believe I mentioned this before to you but matters are since changed I cannot tell what to say Is it permitted me Madam to remind your Royal Highnes of the discourse I have formerly had the honour to have with you on this subject when you used to blame extremely the conduct of poor Mons Shuts for declaring so violently of one party Did your Royal Highnes not use to tell me that a prince should strive to be a prince of his people and not by espousing a faction give distaste to two thirds of his subjects especially a successor who is called in to the succession by both parties whose succession both parties were to maintain and whose succession always meets with the greatest opposition from those who have now the folly to range themselves on t'other side You were pleased Madam sometimes to tell me that you saw the nation established in the protestant succession for the good of itself and posterity and not out of affection to your persons who the greatest part of the nation knew not that you were sure that very reason alone would support your succession and to meddle in intrigues and parties could only create personal and party distaste and make opposition to your succession which else could never happen as long as the reason and motive which induced the nation to settle the succession on your family subsisted But I hope these idle stories the public hear of Bothmar's siding with the faction are false like many others for I know inpartiality temper is the character of the Elector and I must do Mons Bothmar that justice that here I found him extremely impartial and temporate I knew upon the first bringing over the general points he objected the words The Protestant had been better than The Present Establishment I told him that certainly  the last expression was the same as the first for the present establishment of the succession was that in the Elector's family I told him I believed they didn't just hold to the old beaten words being they would have these preliminaries appear entirely general in every point that none could take it amiss and that it might not appear as restrained as the former were and therefore they avoided the same words That if he had nothing else to assure him of the sincerity of the intentions of the ministry in favour of the protestant succession though all their lives and actions have shewn that is their first principle yet they would not have chosen the bishop and me being they knew both our principles and that we had both the honour to be perfectly known to your court especially myself Bothmar seemed satisfied with the discourse and assurances he had from me whilst I had the honour of seeing him alone though after the duke of Marlborough came hither he was so often taken up in his Grace's company I had not the same opportunity of conversing with him which I was sorry for being Mons Bothmar is one I had always a perfect esteem for and should have been glad of his assistance to have advanced in my negociations the interest of your most illustrious family"

reading although I was very much surprised that you say to me that they have written to you from London that Mr Bothmar has declared for the Whigs But as you say towards the end of your letter that the rumour may be false I shall have no difficulty to convince you that it is and you will see by the memorial which he has given on the part of the Elector that neither Whigs nor Tories are mentioned in that affair But as the Queen did the honour to my son the Elector to demand by my lord Rivers his opinion of the preliminaries of peace he thought it was his duty to give it which he would not have done if her Majesty had not commanded him and it was neither  by his order nor by the order of Bothmar that the memorial has been printed But it's said her Majesty has not been dissatisfied with it

that I believe it is not to be doubted but the sons and grandsons of those live who were of the party who did that barbarous murder on the King your Royal uncle and all those are ranged in the party of the present Whigs and certainly the same discourse is now held and has been since time held among them as was in those former unhappy times therefore one has reason to apprehend from the same race and same principles the same facts and I believe no true Whig will in his conscience where he is put to it and has any conscience say that he loves monarchy better than democracy Now the danger those princes run that make use of a party whose principle and conscience is against them is obvious to all the world and I yet I say again naturally I am of neither party but was for moderation till I saw it so abused that it only put the government in danger then out of love to my country and not till then I put myself and interest entirely into the other party not that I am personally angry with any one man of the party but really the business of party is so confounded that even a native of our country can hardly distinguish them and how much less could Mr Bothmar who has not been in all his lifetime in England not above five or six months at most and therefore very very unfit to meddle in such nice matters especially he not speaking the language and not only to draw himself into a matter he could not understand but also the Elector his master whose apparent interest it was not to have meddled to have set any one of either party against him I may almost venter to say in confidence to your R H who has always shown a particular indulgence for me that I knew from whence the spring of that memorial came and the violence of those people I fear will do great prejudice at your court and pray believe me Madam the Queen and all her present ministers are entirely well disposed for the succession of the crown in your family and nothing can turn that disposition no not even the unkind way of remonstrating and blaming their intentions and proceedings in print by way of memorial and pardon me Madam if I say that if the Queen had made an  overture of her intentions  and asked the Elector's sentiments by lord Rivers was it not by that lord and in the same secret manner the Elector ought to have sent the Queen his answer and have told her his sentiments Was my lord Rivers whose

must own it was not opposed by the ToriesI am glad in one part of my arguments your Royal Highness seemed to aquesse that you never loved or liked the dutchess of Marlborough's character and that you thought the duke's way of speaking of the Queen was in too slighting a manner If your Royal Highness had known and seen as much as the Queen has done you would think much worse of both really Madam a prince is happier that rules the hearts of all his people than he who is set up by one and sets himself at the head but of one party In a limited monarchy he reigns but over half his people The temper and constitution of England is mightily mistaken by some people this the Queen saw that by reigning by one party was but being a slave to the heads of that party and therefore when she first made her change it was possitively resolved not to stick to parties but to those who served her best However the other party's opposition and violence may have made her change her mind for the mere necessity

is in that house to have a peace so much that some expressed themselves that if the Queen met with any difficulty from her Allies if she would lay it before the parliament they would ease her but they  were told by a minister of state they must be easy at least till Wednesday se'night and by that time the Queen would lay something before them which was hoped would be to their satisfaction This uneasiness shows that any peace almost would be agreeable to the nation and yet I am persuaded we shall have a good one and such a one that was not expected and must be relished by every one who

insert the names of the regents in the blanks left in the copy of the instrument there is not even room for them I gave you the names of those who were formerly and who are now intended to be regents

would very much disgust those who want now by way of precaution against a case which is scarcely possible to put him to the trouble of naming regents by separate instruments  The act of parliament gives that power only to the nearest heir therefore the Elector has it not and the validity of his nomination at this time might be disputed It is to be hoped that the Queen and the Electress will not die in the same week  As their Electoral Highnesses always assured the Queen and her ministers that none of the family would go to England without her Majesty's consent that will be still the case if a pension is granted to the Electress and being under that new obligation to the Queen they will be the more disposed thereby to do nothing but in concert with her Besides the more the succession is firmly established the less will the  presence of the successor be necessary Add to this the past conduct of their Electoral Highnesses for each party in their turn incited them to apply for an invitation to go to England and they always rejected all these intrigues being determined to do nothing in that respect unless the Queen entreated them to it  It is not probable that the English

cause was the death of the duke of Hamilton That nobleman was killed unfairly in a duel in Hydepark on the th of November while he was upon the point of setting out for France in the character of ambassadorextraordinary The secret object of his embassy the Jacobites affirmed was to obtain the Irish regiments in the French service to be conveyed with the Pretender in a clandestine manner to Scotland The Queen herself eager for the eventual succession of her brother is said to have approved of this scheme Her object was to enter into a treaty with the Pretender upon his arrival by which she was to permit him to remain during her own life in Scotland under the character of presumptive heir of the crown His friends in parliament were so numerous that she formed no doubt of being able to repeal the act of settlement These measures were prevented by the duke's death But the Jacobites continued their intrigues in Great Britain with unabating diligence and entertained great hopes of success The nation owed the disappointment of their schemes to the timidity of their leaders and the enthusiasm of the Pretender himself in adhering to the Romish faith contrary to the advice of all his friends The following papers throw a new and very important light on the history of the present year The secret intrigues of both parties are distinctly marked and accurately related and a chain

his kind offices He answered me that his design to oblige the King would induce him to do a great deal more if it lay in his power and appeared glad that the expression of his Majesty's passport was to his Majesty's liking as he  designed it As to the Emperor's safe conduct it is still the same with the copy I had the honour to send your lordship some time ago but the duke had an explicatory

the Emperor he has what secures and satisfies his nicety upon that point so that he designs to send to your lordship the Emperor's and his own passport as soon as he has his answer from the court of France which is not yet come His Royal Highness expects also by the latter end of this month an answer from Holland about the safe conduct of that state and does not see any difficulty to be made of it"  January "This day his Royal Highness gave me the inclosed copy of the Emperor's last letter in order to send it to your lordship The reason why he has not sent it sooner was that he feared your

the Emperor and that the duke is very far from acting any part that might be disobliging to the King or that did not become his own character he hopes those words of course such as he looks upon them to be in the Emperor's letter will not startle your C the main point I think is that his Royal Highness is well enough satisfied that by that letter he lies under no obligation to answer for any of the King's actions  He has an account from Holland that his envoy having told the bishop of Bristol the Emperor's safe conduct was come the latter was curious to know by what name or qualification the Emperor specified our King and having read the copy of that instrument appeared well enough pleased that he was not at all named in it but designed by the words  exhibitor presentium  The prelate told

for a model and a motive to dispatch theirs He expects in a few days a courier that may inform him further about it which I shall wait for  The duke presumes that the safe conduct from England has been dispatched a great while ago his envoy there having writ positively to him above three months ago that he had been told so by the minister Your lordship knows what there is of it and may perhaps judge it proper to inform me of it for if it be not granted yet and that it may require the ceremony of being solicited by his Royal Highness he is ready to act in that according to instructions and

a race and who comes first wins I writ to you about the beginning of last summer that Mr Arnold said it was not the way of merchants to pay bills that were not called for in a twelvemonth and therefore that if you thought fit you would renew that order to him lest that might happen for which it was designed but I have not heard a word from you since which makes me think you have some better way perhaps now by Freeman France However pray let me know I am discharged of the matter that no blame may be on me for till you tell me so I shall not think myself discharged and without the renewal of that bit of credit shall not be enabled to send I suppose you have heard that  your friend Mr Knox the King is gone to the Levant Lorrain and now it is hoped that Mr Chapple of Crawford church of England may appear and follow his business it will be no small advantage to Kirkton the King  Mrs Lighton Lesley has of late been much indisposed and is now in like condition as about two

there for whom she has a great value  Yours sincerely H S"  D N vol iv to No  "An extract of Mr Rogers's Plunket's letters of the th th th d and th of February "  This extract is in Sir William Ellis's hand and was probably sent by him to the earl of Middleton Almost every circumstance is authenticated by the Hannover Papers of the same month  About the succession to the crown after the death of Queen Anne and the intrigues for securing it for her brother  "THAT what he had said in a former letter viz That Mr Harley and his brethren would call home the King he had it from and has since had it confirmed to him by Mr Netterville which is he says as much as if he had had it from Mr Harley's own mouth and that he has had the same thing confirmed to him at several times by Mr Pen the Quaker  That lord Mulgrave and the rest of his opinion would be glad to have the King home as soon as possible if they knew how to do it without running any hazard and that princess Anne is of the same mind but timorous This he says comes from lady Fretchwel  The reasons he gives for not making use of a cypher formerly sent to Mr Netterville in order to his corresponding with my lord Middleton are that the French ministers had given him a disadvantageous character of my lord Middleton That his lordship and lord Melfort do not agree and betray one another That Mr Netterville was desired from thence that is from St Germains or from Paris not to correspond with any there for he would have been betrayed But that Mr Netterville tells  him that my lord Middleton and Sir William Ellis are honest moderate and understand the affairs of England the best of any he knows consequently the fittest to be entrusted and employed He gives another reason for not using the cypher sent to Netterville viz Lest Mr Harley should know he corresponds with any about the King and gives measures different from Mr Harley's and such as may hinder the King from coming to the terms which he says perhaps may be expected from his Majesty that Mr Harley would have the King kept in the dark believe nothing but what comes from him or think of a restoration but by his means and that the King must abandon Rome if he desires to come home Mr Netterville asked him why he did not send some body to the King to know his mind he replied the King of France would know it and would raise disturbances in England which he Harley would prevent all he can which Mr Rogers says he believes he will do as long as princess Anne lives and advises not to believe the contrary or rely on a civil war as Messrs Harley and Netterville say they are sure we are made believe by Sheridan Mrs Fox Mr Minnis Mr Ferguson and these Mr Rogers says he calls Propaganda stories These he desires may not be believed because the writers are strangers to the affairs on the anvil  He says he is surprized that Sir William Ellis had not the papers he sent him from Rotterdam and says he directed one of them to Sir Richard Cantillon  That D Hamilton proposed to obtain of the King of France four or five regiments to have gone with the King to Scotland and then princess Anne and the parliament would have ventured to treat with his Majesty which they won't hazard to do otherwise till after the peace and till they have turned out all the Low Church men which being done will send to treat with his Majesty and with the King of France who must give as a security for the King's performance  That Mr Harley manages the Low Church and Hannover till he can get the peace settled Believes him hearty to the King's interest and has several instances of it though few of the Jacobites believe him to be so  The cabinetcouncil are for the King for their own interest and fear but will hazard nothing That Mr Harley has so watchful an eye over  him Rogers that he can't go to lord Mulgrave nor B but lord Yarmouth goes between them That Mr Netterville knows every thing and Mr Harley consults him in every thing and yet he meaning as it is supposed Netterville would have the King restored at any rate  That they Mr Rogers and Mr Netterville would fain make duke D'Aumont subservient to the King's interest but Rogers thinks he and those about him are more capable of spoiling than doing business for he duke D'Aumont thinks he knows more than he does won't be advised and pretends to know England of which he knows nothing at all but however thinks he may be made some use of such as to fetch and carry He desires this may be read to none but to the King  That the cabinetcouncil intend to purge the army and the guards and make a thorough regulation in the kingdom That he Rogers will give a full account of all circumstances when he comes That he is told he shall after a little time be sent to Bar to let the King know his true friends in Scotland and England but whether he is sent or no he will endeavour to come because it will be of use to his Majesty's affairs though he knows Mons Torcy and Mr Harley do not desire he should go at present but he says he will find a good colour when there is occasion  That a great many of the Whigs have subscribed a paper and sent it to princess Sophia setting forth their own strength and advising that young Hannover may be sent to England whither he may lawfully come being naturalized a peer That he Rogers could have got said paper secured but thought it best to let it be sent in order to let Hannover further expose himself to no purpose which will turn to the King's advantage By way of postscript to this letter which is of the February he says he had just then had a letter from Holland advising that lord Churchill and his friends are taking measures to send over young Hannover as being the only resort he and his party have But Mr Rogers thinks as before the sooner he attempts it the better In his letters of the February March he gives an account of the measures lord Churchill and the Dutch are taking and particulars of the paper which the Whigs subscribed and sent to the princess Sophia viz  That princess Anne could not live longer than March  That she princess Sophia should order matters so as to be ready to come at twentyfour hours warning  That they will get the heads of the clergy to give princess Anne a memorial setting forth that the King is coming to England and bringing with him the Roman Catholic religion This they believe will make the country declare for the succession of Hannover and give a handle to the parliament to send for princess Sophia and her grandson as the only pledges she princess Anne and the kingdom can have at present for the security of the protestant religion in and out of England for the future  That they will urge in their said memorial to have the Whigs share equally with the Tories in the government  That they will get the D of Hannover's minister in England to second this memorial which Mr Rogers says he hopes he Hannover's minister will do but believes the cabinetcouncil will prevent the giving of any such memorial That Mr Harley laughed at it but looks on it to be well concerted  That Somers Halifax and Cr are pressing Netterville daily to use his interest with Mr Harley to bring them and their friends into business that the person who manages this affair with Netterville is his Mr Rogers's acquaintance and tells him also that Cowper the late chancellor if he could get off handsomely from the Whigs would join with princess Anne in all her measures  That he Rogers knows Mr Harley is for dividing the employments betwixt the High and Low Church and for having the choosing of them himself hoping by that means to be master whoever gets the crown But that the Octoberclub will never suffer this and Mr Harley stands in awe of that club which is jealous of him already and if he should share the places as aforesaid he would soon be discarded  That Mr Harley has spies among the Whigs that discover all their designs and he lets them play with their plot till he sees his time to break it and then they begin another This Mr Rogers says he knows to be true as having been employed in these matters from the beginning  That if the papers he Rogers has given to the cabinetcouncil were published he doubts not they would reconcile all the kingdom to the King's interest but that Mr Harley believing this would lessen his credit with the King and give his Majesty occasion to think what service he Harley might do was more out of necessity than duty and affection has opposed and prevailed with princess Anne to oppose the publishing of said papers which lord Mulgrave and his Majesty's true friends were for having done That there are two parliamentmen who would fain have him Rogers give them some of those papers that they would improve them to advantage But he says he thinks it too nice a thing to venture upon without advice so desires Sir William Ellis's opinion by the next ordinary and believes the Octoberclub would make a good business of it  That there is an old acquaintance of his Rogers there at London who sends intelligence to princess Sophia of what the Whigs are doing That the said person shows him Rogers all she sends That she is a great confident of princess Sophia's and by this means he Rogers shall have a further occasion he says of serving the King  That we he says meaning as seems himself and the King's friends there must strain a point to get the King soon restored for lord Mulgrave is old and lord Shrewsbury is right but timorous These two he supposes govern the cabinetcouncil and keep Mr Harley in awe and that if Mulgrave dies Mr Harley will send lord Shrewsbury to Ireland and then govern the cabinetcouncil to give the crown to whom he pleases and that this makes him Harley delay and go so slow in reforming the government  That to prevent Mr Harley's management as aforefaid he Rogers had thought fit to acquaint lord Mulgrave with some late advices he had had from Holland viz That Heinsius is of opinion Holland can't be safe whilst the government of England is in the hands of the Tories and that it should be the business of the Dutch and Whigs whether there be war or peace to blow up the Tories or at least make them uneasy That since this advice has been communicated as aforesaid he Rogers finds Mr Harley is uneasy and is afraid that the cabinetcouncil will join with the Whigs this session of parliament to send him to the Tower and to obviate it he is for making five or six peers more and  to publish the peace at least with France and Spain which he thinks will so far please the two houses in regard of the advantages England has by it that they will be soon reconciled to him  That on Feb March a man of note had advice from Ireland that the Whigs there are ready to declare for Hannover and that the West of Scotland will join with them That Netterville acquainted Mr Harley with this and advised him to proceed forthwith to a thorough reformation in the three kingdoms that otherwise princess Anne could not be safe That Mr Harley answered No danger That the parliament will be so well pleased with his conduct and management that the Whigs and their adherents will be soon laid on their backs That all the country gentlemen are for princess Anne and her ministers and will not be for Hannover That the Whigs may make a noise this session and invite Hannover to come to nose princess Anne yet all will not do and they will get no point by it for the parliament will declare neither way Their business will be to secure the protestant religion and order matters so now that it will not be in the King's power ever to hurt it Mr Rogers adds that by this means he Harley will weather the point And that you he says "may depend upon it if there is truth in man and I he says understand any thing the way is a paving for the King but as they are resolved to run no risque for a restoration they'll take their own time and the safest way to do it and the King of France is in the secret" and you will find all this to be true in the end  I he says don't think the King safe at Barleduc and that the allies will stand at nothing to ruin him  That he Rogers had since his last which was of the February March introduced Netterville to D D'Aumont who discoursed with them two hours and a half That they showed him how easy it would be for his master and him to procure the King's restoration if they would follow the measures that should be given them That the said duke answered "their desire should be strictly complied with" and that the King or none of his house should know any thing till the business is done He the duke told them he would rely on what intelligence they will give him and will give what money is necessary for carrying on his master's business which they had showed him was to restore the King with regard  to his own safety and welfare of which he seemed to be sensible desired their friendship and assistance and said they should find their account in it  'Tis believed lord Nottingham will at the meeting of the parliament insist on Hannover's being sent for  That there is come for England one Widam of Camb as he pretends himself from the King of France That he told Mr Netterville that the King is not much concerned for the crown is nothing at all addicted to the Roman Catholic religion is in the hands of lord Middleton and Sir William Ellis both deists and believes they'll make him one and are not at all liked or looked on in the court of France and that lord Melfort is the man he Mr Netterville should correspond withal This and much more such fulsome stuff it is said Widam told Netterville in order to his acquainting Mr Harley with it but Mr Netterville would not knowing it would do the King harm and if said man stays long he will do hurt What is or has been doing for the King's interest hitherto may be spoiled by such foolish management The man means well but Mr Netterville is not pleased with his actings nor any that hears him  Mr Netterville proposed lately to Mr Harley to have a bill brought in to break the triennial act and to have the army put into trusty hands Mr Harley answered the breaking the triennial act would seem too violent and there's reason to hope the next parliament will be as good as this The kingdom will be so well pleased with the peace that the present ministers will be better settled than hitherto and the late ministers more blasted this session than they were the last That the country gentlemen will never be reconciled to the Whigs  Mr Rogers says that most of the country gentlemen are for having the King but will hazard nothing  That he finds after a little while the duke of Berwick may have a passport to come for England that he and lord Middleton and Sir William Ellis are not hated but lord Melfort is Mr Netterville tells Mr Harley they are men of moderation which is well looked on among them in England  That it's desired the King of France or any of his may not know that Mr Rogers writes to Sir William Ellis and what he writes he desires  the King only may know it  and that Mr Netterville tells him they must serve the King unknown to the King of France and those about him and that the King of France must make use of no other measures but what they in England give him"  Nairne's Papers vol ix to p  The Earl of Middleton to Berry  March th  "YOUR friend Mr Plessington the King read your letter to me of the th ult with a great deal of satisfaction finding you persist still in your former opinion that it is Baker's Harley's real interest and consequently his inclination to have Harper's Hannover's decree reversed It's certain that if Aylmer the princess Anne should break die before the cause be reheard that Baker Harley is in as much danger of suffering in proportion as Manly the King and therefore it is reasonable to hope he should use all his endeavours to bring this matter to a speedy issue as soon as possible he can since delays are equally dangerous for both  I wish the late alarm he has had of Aylmer the princess Anne breaking may quicken him a little for what was like to happen when even Berry himself in some of his last letters had no apprehension of Aylmer's the princess Anne's affairs being in any real danger may happen hereafter in effect when least feared or expected and in such a case no wise merchant who has his all at stake ought to lose a moment to ensure his effects and make himself and his partners easy  I reckon Baker Harley is sure of Philips the peace by this time and Young princess Anne and he may reckon upon Kemp's King's friendship Wanly the Whigs is low at present and they have it in their power to make him them yet lower Wheatly the English has but one objection against Manly the King which Arnot and all Cary's true relations the church of England know to be unreasonable since all the reasonable security Cary himself can desire to remove all fears of danger from Cotton's partnership the Roman Catholic religion Manly the King is willing to grant  This old dying man Price the parliament is tractable Baker Harley has an ascendant over him and he cannot be sure of having the same credit with his successor nor that Young princess Anne himself  will be then in being and in a condition to support him Edward's England's best relations speak well of Manly the King at present and the generality of Wheatly's family the English are dissatisfied with Harper's Hannover's late behaviour but these gentlemen being changeable their hearts may cool All this considered I confess I cannot see any prudent reason for Baker's Harley's dilatory proceedings but he being the chiefest lawyer and his own interest so much concerned Manly the King must be governed by him and comply with what he cannot help and in the mean time have patience and hope the best"  There follows here a paragraph in which names occur for which there is no key in the whole correspondence  "Plessington the King is

and as long as he can the reason you shall know by word of mouth  Arbuthnot Argyle begins to be obstreperous Overton Harley thought to make him his smuggler spy on the Waggs Whigs and bully them on occasion but he will do nothing for him till he gets Hawley's duke Hamilton's place Overton Harley won't trust him with it Arbuthnot Argyle is resolved to hector him into it Overton Harley makes satires on him in order to expose him and thinks to silence him time will shew how they will end The Waggs Whigs will spirit him to be uneasy to Overton Harley and Quaint princess Anne They say they will move to have Mrs Strange princess Sophia here but I am told by some sensible men among the partners parliament they will get no point by it for they had enow of strangers They talk kindly of Mr Jenkins the King at least to me and begin to hate Hall Hannover more and more because the Waggs Whigs stand up for him He has his seven brass candlesticks in Hungal's house house of commons which opens lightly in his favour One of them said the other day that it was fitting Quaint princess Anne should have no map money before the portion peace was laid before them if the stature large great seal be put to it she should not be ashamed of letting them  see it but got no point by the brazen impudence The next thing they will do is to object against every point of the portion peace to make the mates ministers odious and Egleton's the Emperor's standing out as he does will give them a further handle to cavil I must tell you by the by if Egleton the Emperor would but close with Knox King of France the Duncans Dutch will be forced to vomit up what they are to get by this pardon general peace and of course will be glad to give a helping hand to Mr Kennedy the King He would do well to make a proposal of this kind to him by his nephew there I knew full well the Waggs Whigs make him and Hall Hannover believe Quaint princess Anne won't live long and of course he must come here and then renew the weatherhot war again  I have given convincing arguments to Egleton's mates Emperor's ministers that he must not believe the Waggs Whigs any more I foretold him every thing that happened him hitherto He now finds it to be true to his cost I know Overton Harley and his brethren would be glad on't for it would give them a good handle to call Mr Kennedy the King home and run no risque or hazard of life or fortune It is true the mates ministers have enough under their thumb to justify their conduct in this point but they are coverts cowards so you see we must drive that nail as far as it goes You may depend on't they will keep the same conduct with Mr Kennedy the King as they did in making the portion peace and carry things on with the same caution which you'll say will be tedious but they think it more sure Overton Harley is a goe cart that must be pricked as he goes along  It is therefore Rogers put a precept paper into his hand the other day that Moulsworth lord Churchill caresses Hall Hannover mightily and is putting him on coming to Evelin's house England with a good allen army This and several other precepts papers he has given him with which he seemed well pleased and no doubt will have good effect which is all that offers at present from dear Sir c  J TOMSON  I desired to put all the papers I have into S Sheridan's hands and digest them into an order and bring

as good an effect on the people as Shacheverel's sermons and trial They continue to bombard the Queen and ministry every day but will get nothing by it They have no interest in or out of parliament

soon as practicable which will hardly be before the st of June or Midsummer There is a lady from Hannover that has some pretentions in the French court where she will be recommended from hence and from princess Sophia He will put himself into her retinue and may be useful to her in France Princess Sophia will take it kindly of any body that will do this lady any service Rogers conceives he may be by her means being under so great a princess's protection more useful to Mr Evans Sir William Ellis and his master the King because he can appear barefacedly He must therefore wait her time  I must dear Sir be under your direction whether I should see Peyton Polignac or Tradenham Monsieur de Torcy before I see you I conceive I must stay some time at Putney Paris before I go to your parts and if I should see any body else before I see Tradenham Monsieur de Torcy or Peyton Polignac it won't be taken well If it could be ordered so that I could see Mr Bensongs duke of Berwick as I arrive at Putney Paris it would be of use he is I know a favourite at Knox house King of France I am resolved to talk to none but him and Mrs Quarnington the Queen I expect by your next to know your mind and

Emperor comes to  by the time prefixed if he does what relates to him will be struck out for they don't think sit to expose him About the close of the summer session they will publish them in order to sower the Chammismen country gentlemen against the Waggs Whigs and to keep up their spirits till the new partners parliament are chosen I find he gutted the precepts papers for should they print them  in haec verba  the men worthy mob would tear the Waggs Whigs in pieces Overton Harley says there is a medium between Scylla and Carybdis and will keep it as much as he can The partners parliament will carry on their business smoothly and roundly with little or no noise but with caution and manage that of the sape succession as they did the portion peace and take their own time to do it and it will be left entirely to them This I know to be Overton's Harley's mind and his scheme which will be put in execution when things are ripe for it which cannot be before the next new partners parliament meets This you will find to be true I find Mr Yates lord Yarmouth will be provided for and a great many of Mr Kennedy's the King's friends advanced after a little time which is a good sign  As for news we have little or none The parliament took off two shillings in the pound which will make itself a high church parliament The Whigs are mad at this and will be more especially if the parliament gives the broken officers their whole subsistance because it will screen the ministry and them and what they can do Today or tomorrow it will be known what will be done in it so that the Whigs will have nothing left to scare the vulgar with but Popery and the Pretender especially if they can't get Hannoversent for  They got the higher house of convocation not to join the lower in an address of thanks to her Majesty for the peace There are ten bishops against the address and six pro so that it is believed the body of the clergy must address alone they got the bank and the E I C in their hands which make them more insolent  It is believed my lord Peterborough will be made duke of Monmouth or at least marquis  Just how the house voted halfpay to the land and sea officers The Whigs opposed the latter This will make the ministry more popular  Notwithstanding the usage Egleton the Emperor met with here yet he will trust and cringe to Quaint princess Anne and mates ministry sooner than to Knox King of France for he sent one to her pray she may moderate matters between them He does it because the Waggs Whigs desire him and make him believe Quaint princess Anne cannot live long

what Dunbar princess Anne and Gooldings successor Harley intended to do so he hopes Stuart will not attribute all this necessary prudence of Knowles the King to any neglect or want of friendship and confidence in him for I am authorized to assure you that he has a true and just value for Stuart Scotland and all his honest relations and I hope in time he will be able to give them solid proofs of it and that he is incapable of ever having any unjust partiality for Estmore England in prejudice of Stuart  I told you also that his friend Manning lord Middleton has the same sentiments and is as hearty a wellwisher of Mr Stirling Scotland as  himself could wish and I begged you to do him justice on that head and to assure all your acquaintances in that family that they themselves cannot be more heartily against Uperton the union than he is and always was which Scot himself can witness since he had directions from him from the beginning to desire all his friends to oppose him with their

at last have found what I must conjure our friend to be very circumspect in taking notes from whence he has the account for Mrs White has engaged her honour in it to him that told it her that it shall never come to be named He speaks himself with respect of Mr Philips lord Middleton but told her of what I shall tell you on the other side of this and the young gentleman that came with Mr Jacob's King of France's first agent here has been no friend to Mr Philips lord Middleton but on the contrary has insinuated things to the agent whose secretary he is injurious to our friend altogether they have spread such a suspicious character that does and will be of a very bad consequence to him whose honour and truth can stand the test of all their suspicions but it deters and frights the great traders from engaging their stocks I cannot say it is by the instigation of Mr Ford lord Melfort or his brother but I find the person that told Mrs White was intimate with both for in discourse he told her that Mr Ford lord Melfort had several times wept in relating the story of the unfortunate letter that he says was the cause of so much trouble to him that letter that came here and was sent back to your  house and Mr Jacob's France so that she found by that they were intimate How this person came to speak to Mr Jacob's King of France's chief factor Mr Philips lord Middleton knows and what he proposed for Mr Jenkins' the King's advantage He corresponds with my sister Brown I wish I could persuade her to take you advice but I fear she will marry and so ruin her children"  The two

Anne has a rupture in her belly and is dangerously ill but goes about her chamber  The proposal of this person to the King to come incognito is dangerous and foolish The parliament will do it if she lives long enough to let it sit But the terms will be cruel and unfit to take but if once in possession the power of altering in time will of course follow  The thing the late addresses that passed the parliament has no consequence My lord Fingale spoke to the Lorrain envoy He said he was sent to princess Anne not to the parliament so should take no notice unless she spoke to him All the rest of

intrusted by the person I have named that told me what Mr Jacob's King of France's first man told him and to do that person justice he said he did believe Mr Philips lord Middleton to be a man of honour I cannot find yet if he has told the same to any other person than Mrs White Rogers has told her several times that he feared an ill character of Mr Philips lord Middleton in regard to Mr Jenkins the King She assured him it was groundless malice Then he repeated that he was the cause of Mr Hamilton's leaving Mr Jenkins the King So she concluded it was from that that the malicious report came but now she finds that it came both ways Mr Rogers is an ill figure of a man and as ill an utterance but what he has fallen into by chance is very extraordinary and I believe that filly appearance has been of great help to him in doing what he has done I believe you will say what he has writ was well done and like a man of a better appearance He will be serviceable when at the great town Paris and Mr Harris Harley will see what he sends and supply him in the factory He is honest The traffick will require Mr Philip's lord Middleton's and your head to manage He has promised me to have to do with no other in this traffick but your friend he means my lord Middleton and you Mr Peregrine Ferguson would have him to trade with Mr St Stafford that is with Mrs Rachell the Queen and the person I have named would have him trade with Mr Inese who he trades with but he assures me he will attend Mrs Philips my lady Middleton and by her trade with Mrs Racheil the Queen and then buy and sell by Mr Philip's lord Middleton's and your direction It is odd that Peregrine Mr Fergusion should have under Mr Jenkins's the King's hand to be one of the factors for present chalk cash one of his circumstances  for none here will deal with him in that way he is so indigent and other things alledged I believe very well of him but many others do not What I name of the fifty pounds given must not be named only to know if that person has ever acknowledged to have received that sum of the man I have named for he scorns to name it only to know if it be approved his giving it so because he pretends to have direction to be one of the factors named to receive an account of trade for Mr Jenkins the King he would have had as much more since This person would have refused a thousand pounds himself or two hundred ayear to the fund if there had been a compliance from others of the manufactory What he wants in understanding the trade he makes up in zeal and bravery of spirit for the good of the company What I mean of not knowing he has told any other than Mrs White is I cannot prove he has though I don't doubt but he has because of the report being spread though yet I cannot fix it on any particular person that has been told it by him You will judge when you see Mr Rogers what is fit to let him know since those he will deal with here will acquaint Mr Harris Harley with what he writes for they are at his devotion to all intents and he not at all a friend only will have it in his power at once if he finds it will be so without him to seem to have had always the intention and waited for an opportunity for that is the true character of Mr Harris Harley I find that Mr Innes I have named is no friend to Mr Philips my lord Middleton and I am sure those of his character do Mr Jenkins the King great injury by being with him at this time and his not being in their hands as his father was has done him a great service so that his being there is not well I desire Mrs Philips my lady Middleton will receive Rogers well and not think worse of him for his figure I wish Mr Philips lord Middleton would write himself a kind letter to Mr Askine lord Aylesbury my friend that was at Brussels who is now at Paris and ill of an ulcer in his bladder He has long taken it ill he did not answer his letters which is the reason he does not write there though he is still the same Mr Ford my lord Melfort has been once to see my friend lord Aylesbury and he returned it but no more friendship will ever be betwixt them I do not know if Mr Rogers can support himself or if he expects to have a consideration from those concerned who are to reap the benefit I believe Mr Harris  Harley will take care underhand for by what I have found out he is at the bottom but I am fully persuaded Rogers is truly zealous for the good of the manufactory and indeed every action has proved it and the use that can be made will be of consequence Adieu  I assure you you are not mistaken in your

father of theirs was taken in Flanders and when they found it was not Plowden they let him go and that my lord Middleton was the man that knew of this business The second thing was that young Sheridan told my lord that his father was sent to the Elector of Cologne who promised to assist the King with money but when Sheridan came he shuffled him off because he found all designs were discovered to those here The third was that a letter sent by duke Hamilton was sent back to the prince of Orange and that he shewed it him and in a pleasant manner bid him do so no more My lord asked the duke himself if this was true who answered it was false and spoke of my lord Middleton with respect and not at all so of my lord Melfort That of Monsieur Pontchartrain I find my lord Fingale spoke of to the Queen but she told him he Pontchartrain was angry with my lord Middleton and was a passionate man but he lord Fingale did not speak to her the Queen in the very bare terms he Pontchartrain spoke them to him lord Fingale which were as I writ them in my last But now this lord is convinced that all this is occasioned by malice and designs and desires that my lord Middleton will be pleased to

man If the King approves of it they will call for the box where the names of those are whom princess Sophia sent to be commissioned to have the government in their hands till she could come after the death of princess Anne This was sent when they thought her a dying and then the parliament if the box be produced will declare against the choice as men that are against the constitution and will take the occasion to prove that there are a number of Papists in employments in that state and that they have built them a church and then prove all the disrespectful things which that court has done

thought fitter to say nothing at all upon the subject referring to Ch Kinard  "  SIR  "I Am sorry to find you lay so much stress upon Mr Smith's the King's living being or not living being in Forbes's catholic family as if the issue of his law suit depended upon it when Mr Anderson E Mar himself knows that it would be against all law to cast him upon that account since therefore you have been so plain with me upon this subject confiding in your friendship I will use the same freedom with you in telling you my thoughts of this matter  In the first place if Smith's friends require this condition from him they do him no favour for he could compound at that rate with his greatest enemies and with Cramond himself the Whigs  In the next place living or not living with Forbes must be a voluntary act of one's own free choice otherwise it cannot answer the ends for which it is required It would be but cheating and imposing upon one another which is neither Smith nor Cant's Church of England's intention  If Smith be willing on one side as certainly he is to give Cant's family all the marks of favour and friendship that can be asked of him for the benefit of the family I think it a little hard on the other side that Cant church of England should not allow him the liberty that all freemen have to live where he pleases and to follow his own judgment in a thing that relates only personally to himself and can be of no real prejudice to Cant  If he were to trade with a Cramond Whiggish mob I should not wonder at any hardship of that kind from such people But I hope Cant's church of England's relations are men of too good principles to refuse the liberty to Smith himself which he is willing and ready to secure to all their family in the strongest and most authentic manner that they themselves can desire  They own that the justice of the cause in question is altogether independant of Mr Talbot religion therefore to deal justly and impartially  with Smith they should begin by deciding his law suit and after he is in peaceable possession of his estate then he and Cant church of England may talk of Talbot's concerns religion with more honour and freedom and less suspicion of being biassed by views of interest than at present  I must tell you that I know Smith to be very nice upon that point for if it were to receive a crown he would not do a thing that might reproach either his honour or his sincerity He desires a union of confidence friendship and interest with Cant church of England above all things because he thinks him an honest man and they may be mutually useful to one another For that reason he seeks all occasions to oblige him and to make all those of his relations that are with him easy and it is for their satisfaction that he has brought a person lately into his family who has free liberty to serve them in their own way  He had reason to hope that Cant would be satisfied with this testimony of his goodwill towards him and that in return he would be as easy to him as he has been to his relations but instead of that he has met with more uneasiness upon that subject than he had before what he meant only for the comfort and satisfaction of his friends having been interpreted beyond what he intended which has drawn several unseasonable teazings upon him on one side and occasioned rash judgments on the other He cannot help people's speaking but it were to be wished at least that his friends had spoke of Talbot religion and him with more caution and prudence than they have done For their late reports have done him no good on the contrary they have exposed him to be looked upon as a wavering interested and dissembling spirit which is quite the reverse of his character  I must desire you therefore as you love Smith's interest and reputation to use your endeavours to silence their groundless reports wherever you perceive they may do him harm and to prevail all you can with Cant's church of England's chief relations not to teaze upon Forbes's catholic account in so unseasonable a conjuncture as this is Let them ask for themselves whatever they please He loves them so well that he will refuse them nothing that can tend to make them happy and secure them in their estates This which he hath so often promised and resolves  still in due time to perform should be sufficient and to ask more especially at this time would neither be friendly nor just  Thus Sir having told you freely my mind I hope you will make your own prudent use of it and employ your interest when occasion offers with Ord princess Anne Jones Harley Bambery St John and others of your friends in case any of them have any good will towards Smith the King to persuade them to be contented to trade with him upon the foot here mentioned which is certainly the surest for both sides for whatever he promises they may depend upon nor will he leave it even in his own power to deceive them Whereas if he should at this suspicious time part with his old friend Forbes Catholic so easily or be any ways moved thereto by the motives represented to him by Mr Anderson it would not be prudent in any of his new friends to trust him half so much as they may safely do remaining as he is especially when he offers to give them all the demonstrations of his friendship firmness and sincerity that conscience and honour will allow him"  Nairne's Papers D N vol iv to No  Extracts of a Letter from Doctor Clinch  His opinion of the sentiments of the Ministry with regard to the succession  Sept  "AS for your affairs here I

interest of those that are to serve you to serve you and that they have no other refuge to fly to Now if this be as I imagine yet some think it impracticable because of the difficulty of settling the estate whether it shall be parted or that our friend the King should have it after his relation's death c  I do not concern myself much about these difficulties because I believe that if you are to have any good done you those that design it you will easily find out an expedient to do it by My opinion is that the generality especially those in place here are wholly guided by interest and that setting that aside it is equal to them whether this or that person is put in the possession of the estate and it is for that reason only that you can expect to have yours restored that they may enjoy theirs which otherwise I think they cannot do I have heard that the worthless lord  Wharton insinuated as much as this by one of his profane jests who pointing to the Queen said "if in this life only they have hope they are of all men most miserable"  I should be extremely well pleased to find any motions made in the senate in your favour The Whigs who are ever restless and struggling to no

Plunket's account of various and secret intrigues in England  "ROGERS having for some years been educated in Gerard's house Germany Mr Egleton the Emperor recommended him to Mrs Strange princess Sophia who recommended him to some of our friends among the Waggs Whigs and Egleton the Emperor likewise recommended him to his agent then residing in Evelin's house England This gave the said Rogers an opportunity to contract a  friendship and intimacy with the said agent and the men of business among the Waggs Whigs whereby he had an opportunity of serving Mr Jenkins the King when Quaint princess Anne made the late regulation  The said Rogers having by his daily conversation with Quack Mr Pen a Quaker Noble Netterville and others that were very intimate with Overton Mr Harley and the rest of his brethren found their pulse beat very low and that they were at a loss to maintain the new regulation and it was therefore they caressed the agents of Egleton the Emperor and Simon's house Savoy to bring them into their interest in order for a pardon general a general peace with Knox the King of France exclusive of Duncan the Dutch  Rogers perceiving this would prejudice the interests of Jenkins the King found ways and means to frustrate their design which he brought about in the following manner  He being very intimate with one of the sharpers of Egleton's agent secretary of the Emperor's ambassador who was master of all his sophistry secrets got a precept a paper which contained in substance that the Tanners Tories caressed the said agent minister then more than ever making him great offers in case he would join with them as above but he assured his master Egleton the Emperor that such great offers of the Tanners Tories were an infallible sign they were not in a condition to stand their ground long and assuring him the Waggs Whigs had laid such a foundation as would turn the stream into its former channel and that there was no reason to apprehend the Tanners Tories would dare to deal separately with Knox King of France or run the risque of giving any jealousy to Anabaptists the allies or offending the men worthy the mob  Rogers after having got this precept paper in his hand did signify to Noble Quack and Overton Netterville Quaker Pen and Mr Harley that the Waggs the Whigs in conjunction with the Anabaptists the allies were resolved to supplant Quaint princess Anne and him and also that it was in his power to let him know all their sophistries secrets telling withal that his chief aim in this was purely to serve Mr Jenkins the King Whereupon Harris Harley answered that  he did not dislike his fidelity to his friends assuring him that he should find his account in what service he should do for him and Quaint the Queen  Hereupon Rogers gave him the aforesaid precept paper and all the precepts papers that the agent sent to Egleton the Emperor and Duncan the Dutch from time to time to the number of about twentyfour containing in substance the schemes they had laid for continuing the weather hot war or cold In order thereunto the agent prepared a memorandum to be given in Egleton's the Emperor's name to Quaint princess Anne setting forth that he could raise treble the allen army he had hitherto  Nota bene  that the Agent at the same time advised his master to make large promises till he could gain his point in Evelin's house England and afterwards that ways may be found to evade the performance of them with credit  Which was to be printed and published in order to gain the men worthy mob and exasperate them against Quaint the princess Overton Harley and his brethren and another precept paper giving an account that Simon's house Savoy would stick no longer to Egleton's the Emperor's interest but would look to himself and another precept paper sent from Riston the King of Portugal to Egleton the Emperor importing that he would follow Quaint's the princess Anne's steps Another precept paper proposing a method of removing Quaint princess Anne out of trust the throne and another precept paper containing a method how to prolong the weather hot war for two years longer These with many other matters too long to mention here being given by Rogers to Harris Harley made such impression on Quaint princess Anne and Overton Harley that they immediately resolved upon dealing even separately with Knox King of France  Rogers perceiving the agent to be dejected upon account of his being slighted on this occasion discoursed with him as usually and made a bye motion to him to reconcile him to Kennedy's the King's interest but he being so much elated by the repeated assurances of the Waggs Whigs refused to favour it Whereupon Rogers attacked him another way and told him there was a project set on foot by Lewis old Danby Overton Harley and the rest of the society to marry Mr  Kemp's the King's sister to Knell the King of Sweden and by that means to restore him exclusive of Mrs Strange the princess Sophia  The agent communicated this to his chief confidents among the Waggs the Whigs who were so alarmed at it that they raised all the Devils in Hell to prevent it and said that of the two evils they would rather have Jenkins the King though a physician a Roman Catholic than that such a project should take which would knock all their measures down at once and ruin for ever them and their friends the Anabaptists the allies  Whereupon they sent to Hall Hannover that he would send his agent immediately to Evelin's house England to take care of his interest who thereupon gave in a memorandum which served Quaint the princess Anne Cleveland cabinet council and the partners parliament to a great degree never to be forgotten Beaumont lord Mulgrave Segrave lord Shrewsbury and the rest of the society except Overton Harley were of opinion that the agent should be sent away with Moulins a messenger but Overton Harley said it was not seasonable for several reasons First because the pardon general general peace was not so far advanced as to rely upon Knox King of France secondly that it would give a great cause of jealousy to the men worthy the mob which may draw them away and thirdly because it would make the jewellers Jacobites insolent and give Kemp the King greater hopes of establishing his interest than otherwise he could expect Upon these reasons that business dropt  The Waggs Whigs finding that the memorandum had not the effects proposed by it they sent to Evers prince Eugene to come with all speed to Evelin's house England in order to lay before Quaint princess Anne and partners parliament the necessity of continuing the weather hot war and how Knox King of France bought the pardon general peace for maps money to retrieve which the Waggs Whigs were sure to carry the point by the majority they assured themselves in Holton house of Lords and Hungate house of commons by sending two or three of Clevland cabinet council to Tracy the Tower of London  Rogers having an indenture intelligence of all this from Egleton's Emperor's agent then living at Hatton's house the Hague gave the  said indenture to Overton Harley and the rest of his brethren upon which Moulsworth lord Churchill was laid aside which mightily surprised Evers prince Eugene at his arrival Upon this Moulsworth lord Churchill told Ivers prince Eugene that had he come before the new dozen were made in Holton house of lords all would do well and that now more violent measures must be used rather than fail which Ivers prince Eugene agreed to consult with Jonathan the junto and partners Whereupon he proposed to gather together a great many of the men worthy mob to be led by some of Jonathan the junto and partners to destroy in the nighttime after a frolicksome manner Overton Harley Hervy Sir Simon Harcourt and one or two of his principal companions but Hall's Hannover's agent did not approve of this method conceiving it would turn the hearts of the men worthy mob against his master but Jonathan the junto and partners being divided in this  Ivers prince Eugene proposed another way which was to set fire to several houses in Little Town London and especially near South's house St James's and by this means raise all the men worthy mob and the Waggs Whigs being sure of the Gapers Guards Quaint princess Anne together with the Exchange Exchequer and Tracy the Tower were to be seized and thereupon immediately new partners parliament to be called but Horn Halifax Sands Somers and the late Collier Chancellor did not approve of this  All this Rogers communicated to Overton Harley thinking Ivers prince Eugene would be sent to pain prison but finding that Overton Harley shewed it to Quaint princess Anne and not to Clevland cabinet council he by Yates lord Yarmouth sent under hand a detail of the whole matter to Beaumont lord Mulgrave and the present Collier lord Keeper who laid it before Clevland cabinet council at which Overton Harley was very much surprised and started but told Clevland the cabinet council that he had the same account which he gave to Quaint princess Anne and another mate minister of state saying that Quaint princess Anne finding they were divided among themselves thought it more prudent to smother it To which Clevland cabinet council replied that it concerned them too near not to sift it to  the bottom therefore ordered that Rogers should be called immediately before them to give a full account of the whole matter Overton Harley sent immediately for Rogers and spoke to him as followeth  Rogers you have been betrayed in the sophistry secret and precepts papers you gave me to which Rogers replied that he gave it by Mr Noble's Netterville's advice to Farringdon Ferguson to lard a precept paper that he had then in hand with the heads of it for Quaint's princess Anne's use wherewith Overton Harley seeming to be satisfied asked him what course was proper to take in the matter Rogers knowing what would be acceptable to him proposed to go with him before Quaint princess Anne or any of the mates ministers and accordingly he ordered Rogers to go along with him to Quaint princess Anne But Beamont lord Mulgrave having a hint of this from Rogers underhand ordered him to come before Clevland cabinet council which he accordingly did and was examined upon all the precepts papers which he from time to time during the space of two years before gave Overton Harley and having also declared the manner of his obtaining them Clevland cabinet council was so much satisfied therewith that Rogers was desired to reduce his examination which lasted two hours and a half with all the circumstances into writing and at parting returned him thanks with a promise of a settlement during life and gave positive orders that he should be forthwith sent to Hassel's house Holland to bring back his friend from whom he had Ivers's precept prince Eugene's paper and to discover further the proceedings of Duncan the Dutch and the Waggs Whigs  It is to be observed that Beamont lord Mulgrave whispered Rogers that he should be full and particular in his journal because it would turn to his own and friend's the King's advantage Overton Harley gave the following reasons against his going to Hassel's house Holland First that if it should be found out that a physician Roman Catholic should be employed upon such an occasion at that juncture it would give the Waggs Whigs an occasion to clamour Secondly that it would be enough to divide the Anabaptists allies and that Evelin's house England would never be trusted hereafter if they should expose these sophistries secrets before the partners parliament and  thirdly that it would give Knox King of France an opportunity to make what portion peace he pleased when he found the Anabaptists allies jealous of each other and divided among themselves  But notwithstanding all these reasons Rogers was ordered to go on his journey who coming to Rymer's house Rotterdam he met his confident and engaged him to come back to Evelin's house England where he should be provided for during his life He liked the offer but insisted upon having it under the sharper's secretary of state's own hand This Rogers communicated to Overton Harley but had no answer It is to be observed that notwithstanding these matters did properly belong to the sharper's secretary of state's province yet Overton Harley took it into his own management in order to conceal it from Clevland privy council and communicate it only to Quaint princess Anne and keep Rogers out of the way as long as he could to prevent his being tampered with by Clevland cabinet council  Rogers was not long in Hassel's house Holland when Ciprian arrived from Putney Paris at Hatton's house the Hague and gave three memorandums one to Harpers pensionary Heinsius one to Hall's agent Hannover agent and a third to Egleton's agent the Emperor's ambassador containing in substance all what he and his father transacted in Evelin's house England and that he had contracted in Knox's King of France's name with Clevland cabinet council and especially with Overton Harley for a great quantity of maps money in case he should agree to give a separate portion peace and that Quaint princess Anne desired him to tell Mr Jenkins the King that she would send for him as soon as possible  This was acceptable to the abovementioned three persons who said it was the only thing they wanted and that they had enough to undo Quaint princess Anne and destroy Clevland the cabinet council and prevent the pardon general the general peace Rogers being apprized of all this matter acquainted Overton Harley therewith as he did likewise Doyle Peyton and Mead marishal D'Uxelles Abbé Polignac and Mr Menager assuring them that now they had a good game in hand which if rightly managed would turn to Knox's the King of France's advantage and forward the portion peace to their satisfaction They asked how Rogers answered that Ciprian was to be sent  with good recommendations to Mouldsworth lord Churchill and to the chief of the Waggs Whigs dignified with titles of honour and good characters from Hall Hannover and Egleton the Emperor and that he the said Rogers would go with him to Evelin's house England and introduce him first to Clevland cabinet council to let him see all the precepts papers he had along with him which would be acceptable to Clevland cabinet council who would engage him in Quaint's princess Anne's interest in order to expose the sophistry secret of the Waggs Whigs and Duncan Dutch and lay the same before the partners parliament which would infallibly give them a plausible handle to destroy the shape of Hall succession of Hannover  Mead Monsieur Menager replied that it was not prudent to hazard the breaking the measures so well concerted wherein Rogers had a good share and the said Mead Monsieur Menager well understood that Rogers aimed at the immediate restoration of Kennedy the King to his trust throne and said Knox the King of France would take care of that after finishing the pardon general the general peace Rogers answered that now was the proper time and that such a favourable occasion would never offer again and told them that he would send Ciprian to Stapleton lord Strafford who went the day before to Hassel's house Holland upon this the three retiring aside and consulting a while together they told Rogers that Tradenham Monsieur de Torcy sent for Ciprian in order to give him new instructions to take care of his affairs in Evelin's house England and by that means he might have a better opportunity of serving both Knox King of France and Kennedy's the King's interests  They finding that poor Ciprian did bite at this bait very wisely sent him away to Putney Paris not doubting his sincerity  But Rogers having a watchful eye upon him and discovering his intentions of going directly to the Waggs Whigs got him by a stratagem to Hassel's house Holland and acquainted Stapleton lord Strafford with the whole matter who approved of Rogers' conduct in sending him to Clevland cabinet council and offered to send Moulins a messenger along with him but Ciprian shewing Harper Heinsius the orders which Doyle Mareschal D'Uxelles and his companions gave  for going first to Tradenham Monsieur de Torcy to receive his instructions he approved of it and desired him to go with speed and promising him all the humour honour and pinimo pension he could desire  N B Ciprian having proposed Rogers to vouch the truth of his allegation Harper Heinsius consulted with the agents of Hall and Egleton about securing Rogers but he being apprized of it avoided the snare  So he accordingly went to Tradenham Monsieur de Torcy and how he was received the reader knows  Upon this Rogers told Doyles Mareschal D'Uxelles and his fellows that a good scheme was spoiled if this fellow should be kept in pain prison and that it was sacrificing Kennedy's the King's interest to theirs at present To which Doyles Mareschal D'Uxelles replied that Quaint princess Anne and Knox King of France would do his the King's business in due time and said that for his part he would be sure to acquaint Knox King of France how active Rogers has been in his and Kemp's the King's affairs both there and in Evelin's house England and that he acted like a man of honour especially in this particular  Rogers finding that all the parleys plots he proposed for a present replication restoration must be laid aside for a time he thought of another which he expected may turn to as good account which is as follows  During his abode in Hassel's house Holland he luckily met with a relation of his own who was conversant with the principal men that governed that house state and found by his friend's and his own observation that Hassel's house Holland was governed by Waggs Whigs and Tanners Tories as well as Evelin's house England and that the Waggs Whigs are the persons now in vogue and that the Tanners Tories being in obscurity during this long reckoning revolution were meditating a long time to bring about a replication restoration there after the same manner as in Evelin's house England  Rogers being introduced by his friend to the chief of these Tanners Tories found by discoursing with them that they wanted only a little map money to compass their ends wherein there was no difficulty as in Evelin's house England He upon this proposed to Knox's King  of France's agents among them to supply them and having prevailed with them to send to the said persons who came and made out that they could infallibly do it without noise or stir by bestowing a small matter on such as should be stubborn with this the agents ambassadors seemed well pleased and assured them that Knox King of France should be acquainted with their good intention but Peyton Abbé Polignac told Rogers that he believed Knox King of France would hardly hear of this proposal without first consulting the mates ministers of Evelin's house England Rogers replied that he would send to get Clevland's cabinet council consent but he was called away before he could have an answer He acquainted Clevland cabinet council therewith which was well approved of but Overton Harley said that the portion peace was far advanced and it would be better to defer it till after the pardon general general peace because it would weaken the politician protestant interest abroad saying that although Duncan the Dutch should be humbled yet Knox the King of France should not be exalted  Rogers seeing that Knox the King of France in conjunction with Overton Harley was intent upon securing their own game did resolve to ply Overton Harley warmly by setting Clevland cabinet council upon his back which he did by communicating to Beaumont lord Mulgrave by Yates lord Yarmouth what he wrote to Overton Harley from time to time during his abode at Hassel's house Holland viz  First that Moulsworth lord Churchill wrote to Harper Hensius and Evers prince Eugene not to let the foreign allen army in Quaint's princess Anne's service obey Overbury duke of Ormond thinking thereby to prevent Knox King of France giving up Dean's house Dunkirk to Quaint and this would give the Waggs Whigs a plausible handle to send Overton Harley and one or two more to Tracy the Tower and consequently would be a good excuse for Knox King of France to abandon Quaint  Secondly he discovered at Hatton's house the Hague the new plan framed by Moulsworth lord Churchill Horn Halifax and Sands Somers for bringing Hall Hannover to Evelin's house England by publishing a model a manifesto containing that Kennedy the King was coming from Fitches' house France with a physician allen a  Roman Catholic army and arrived at Sutler's house Scotland and that Hall Hannover was arrived at Evelin's house England to secure the copyhold crown against Kemp the King and that Moulsworth lord Churchill was to have a good allen army of his own By this means they did not doubt but the unthinking menworthy mob would join them and that Quaint princess Anne upon this occasion would doubtless escape as Mr Kemp the late King did at the late reckoning Revolution  This plausible project was sent to Mrs Strange princess Sophia not doubting of her approbation and give her consent to young Hall Hannover going to Evelin's house England  But the more penetrating heads among the Waggs Whigs advised her underhand to be wary in so important an affair and avoid all things that would give the Tanners Tories a good pretence to alter the shape succession  Hall Hannover sent his agent to know the strength of the Waggs Whigs and in case he found their interest to be as they represented it he was to be governed by them and accordingly the agent keeps very close to them who are fully resolved to pave the way for Hall Hannover this summer of partners session of parliament  By this they propose to gain two points first in case the Tanners Tories oppose it then it's clear they are for Kennedy the King which will give umbrage to the menworthy mob and draw them away from the Tanners Tories Secondly They expect to have a majority among the next partners parliament  Rogers wrote to Overton Harley that the person from whom he had all these sophistries secrets should be sent to Evelin's house England to prove it  viva voce  but had no answer while he was at Hassel's house Holland which may fall heavy on him hereafter  HANNOVER PAPERS    TO throw light on the Hannover papers of the present year it is necessary to premise a few particulars The baron de Bernsdorff was president of the Elector's council and M de Robethon secretary for embassies  Secretaire des ambassades  Baron de Grote was his Electoral Highness's envoy at the court of London in the beginning of the present year Grote died in the month of April and was succeeded by M de Schutz whose father had been in England some years before in the same character Kreyenberg was ordinary resident and Galke secretary to the embassy It does not appear that Monsieur l'Hermitage acted in any public character from the court of Hannover he was probably connected with the Dutch embassy at least his business obliged him to go sometimes to Holland The letters from London said to have been sent by a  secret address  were usually directed to Mr Siffen at the Hague  The baron de Bothmar was the Elector's envoy extraordinary at the Hague and his minister plenipotentiary at the treaty of Utrecht Klingraff was resident and Schrader secretary to the embassy The originals of all Bothmar's letters to Robethon are extant and likewise the originals of most of the letters written to him by Schutz Kreyenberg and Galke but of some of them we have only copies in Robethon's hand which he decyphered for the use of the Elector and his ministers They frequently refer him for further particulars to their letters to Bothmar Bothmar sent him copies of these letters decyphered in Schrader's hand and usually marked in his own hand at the top the date of the letter and the name of the writer As these copies are extant we have probably all the letters written by the Hannoverian agents from this country from  the beginning of April this year to the accession of George I in August  They indeed wrote regularly by every post to the Elector himself what they called a narrative  Une relation  but in their letters to Bothmar Bernsdorff and Robethon they generally repeat in a summary manner what they wrote at greater length to their master As either the originals or authentic copies of all their letters are extant we are probably acquainted with the whole subject of their correspondence during a period in which the protestant succession was thought to be in the utmost danger and designs were actually formed for bringing in the Pretender  They sent by every post a very particular account of parliamentary proceedings but it differs in nothing from what is publickly known and therefore has been entirely omitted But every thing that they wrote of the private characters and conduct of the great men who flourished at this period has been carefully extracted and we know at least what the Hannoverians thought of them and in what light they were represented by others  De Grote was sent to Great Britain to obtain a pension for the princess Sophia and the arrears claimed by the Elector as due to his troops which served in Flanders and to insist upon the Pretender's removal from Lorrain The court of Hannover ignorant of that prince's attachment to the principles imbibed in his youth were alarmed this year with rumours of his conversion and directions were sent to Grote to propose some measures which they thought necessary to be taken in such an event  The earl of Oxford made a motion in parliament in the following year which at the time greatly surprised the nation but now the true cause of that measure sufficiently appears The Whigs had invited the Elector of Hannover to invade Great Britain with an army They at the same time endeavoured to show that Oxford meant only to amuse the people by an affected zeal for the protestant succession to conceal his real designs in favour of the Pretender The motion bore that for the further security of the succession it should be made high treason to bring foreign troops into the kingdom A law against bringing troops into  Great Britain to support the cause of the Pretender was unnecessary since such troops if foreigners might be treated as enemies and as natives might be punished as rebels Therefore the design of the earl of Oxford was to allude in his motion to the scheme of the Whigs to bring over the Elector in a hostile manner  The Queen in her speech to the parliament which met on the ninth of April in the present year expressed great zeal for the succession in the house of Hannover But the friends of that family considered the speech itself and the consequent address of the two houses as an artful design of the minister to deceive the nation The agents of Hannover convinced of this circumstance by the Whigs represented to their court the necessity of taking some step to bring the sincerity of these professions to such a proof as would convince the world that neither friendship nor harmony subsisted between the Queen and her ministers and the parliamentary heirs of the crown  The following letters were written by M de Robethon at Hannover to the Baron de Grote in London in January and February They are in Robethon's hand in French but decyphered by an unknown hand  Hannover Papers vol Bothmar No  Robethon to the Baron de Grote  Measures to be taken in case the Pretender becomes ProtestantCorrections on the new Barrier TreatyA

SIR  Hannover  Jan d  "I Doubt not but this will find your Excellency arrived in London Some time ago I hinted to Monsieur l'Hermitage to speak to lord Halifax of a design which suggested itself to me and which having met since with the approbation of all our ministers I have orders to write to you about It is to sound lord Halifax and other friends if they could propose in both houses to bring in a bill exclūding the Pretender and any other Papist who has pretensions to the succession with their posterity even though he should become a Protestant  The reasons for such an act are so strong on account of the rumours which circulate about the prince of Wales in this respect and of the alarms which these rumours give the nation that I do not see they can venture to make great opposition to such a salutary scheme If the act passes we gain every material point for our succession if the Queen's ministers oppose it that will unmasque them and contribute more effectually than any tiling else to open the eyes of the nation Please write to me what our friends say on the subject  I am likewise to tell your Excellency that remarks on the project of a Barrier Treaty proposed to the Dutch by lord Strafford are sent this evening to the Baron de Bothmar We have made seven or eight corrections short indeed but essential to our succession and lent an order to Monsieur de Bothmar to persuade the grand pensionary to try to prevail with the Queen's ministers to admit these corrections Your Excellency will receive a copy of them by the next post not in order to speak of them to the Queen's ministers for you know that the treaty was not communicated to us by them but in order to make use of them hereafter when the opportunity offers which can scarcely miss and in the mean time you are desired to communicate these corrections to lord Halifax and other friends and to write to us their opinion of them I am c"  Hannover Papers vol x Bothmar No  Robethon to De Grote  Translation  Hannover  Jan th  "LORD Oxford had mentioned the treaty of guarantee of the succession to Kreyenberg and consequently would probably mention it to Grote Robethon desires Grote to propose to his lordship in the politest manner he could to insert the corrections and additions which he had mentioned in his preceding letter and of which he now sends him a copy He complains of it as an omission very offensive to them that there was no mention of the Pretender in the treaty and desires to have the person known under the name of the Chevalier de St George particularly specified "if it is in earnest they have abjured the Chevalier if it is in earnest they demand from France to remove him and not to assist him they cannot refuse to mention him in the treaty of guarantee of our succession It is to be hoped the lord treasurer will repair the  omission of such an essential clause and pay attention to the just remonstrances of your Excellency on the subject"  Your Excellency may be assured that in the act which establishes the succession and in all the acts which have been made since concerning it even at the time when the Whigs had all the power in their hands there never was a clause inserted for excluding the Pretender in case he turned Protestant which however would be very necessary It will be said perhaps that the popish lords likewise who might be converted would be excluded thereby from the house of peers But there is a great difference between the sovereign and an individual The Pretender on the slightest appearance of a pretended conversion might ruin all the religion the liberties the privileges of the nation c This is not the case of a lord and therefore it is not parallel Besides when they exclude the Pretender in such a case they may if they chuse make an exception in favour of the lords who would change Your Excellency will speak of all this to persons more capable of judging of it than I am"  Hannover Papers vol x Bothmar No  January th De Grote had given an account of his arrival in London "What you say of the violence of the English is very true and the Electoral Prince to whom I read your letter thinks that your judgment of them is very just  With regard to the passage in cypher all the ministers of his Electoral Highness think lord Halifax a very proper person to make a proposal to Harley  Earl of Oxford  who consulted him and to speak to him both about the pension for the Electress and about the exclusion of the Pretender to be inserted in the treaty of peace Your Excellency will be so good as to converse on this subject with lord Halifax he always paid great attention to Harley who cannot take it amiss that he should enter into these affairs Besides he may speak of them to him as of himself and not at our desire  Monsieur de Bothmar writes to me and all our ministers agree with him that it would be proper to exclude from the crown by act of parliament all those who after compleating their tenth year continue to profess the popish religion"  Ibid No  January th "Your Excellency is in the right to restrain the excessive forwardness and vivacity of lord Sunderland I shall  write to you by the next post if the sentiments of lord Somers concerning the pension are approved of here I am very anxious about what the lord treasurer will say to you on the subject  They write us from Paris that the Pretender is getting himself instructed in the religion of the church of England and discovers he finds great satisfaction in it This doubles the necessity of an act to exclude him even in case of his conversion"  Hannover Papers vol x Bothmar No  January th "All our ministers order me to tell you it is their opinion that you should conform yourself to the sentiments of lord Somers concerning the pension for the Electress and that you should by no means offer to lord Oxford that the Queen and he should dispose of the offices of the household You will recollect that that offer was a thought of the Electress alone who insisted to add it to your instructions and did so principally because she had spoke in that strain to that Harley who was here with whom she is highly dissatisfied at present that gentleman notwithstanding all his fine protestations not having written even once since his departure from Hannover  We have received no intelligence by the means of the duke of Marlborough It is very proper to put a stop to the frequent visits of lord Sunderland without disobliging him however If the affair of the pension succeeds you will be exalted to the third heavens I hope you shall have your share of it and I therefore prefer it in all respects to the affair of the arrears I would not say so however to"  Ibid No  January th "It would be an excellent thing no doubt to oblige France to send the Pretender to Rome and you must neglect nothing that will induce the British court to demand it  Such is the spirit of oeconomy here especially since the speedy return of our troops is looked for that you must not expect the Elector will put his hand to his pocket even for a masterstroke of party  coup de partie  such as would be beyond contradiction to gain the duke of Argyle and his brother although according to Bernsdorff there is not room to hesitate a moment"  "Another proof of this" spirit of oeconomy continues Robethon "is that the president told me that having insisted with OUR MASTER for some extraordinary allowance for your Excellency on account of your  journey to London and to enable you to settle there the answer was a flat denial and that he would not give a penny above what the late M de Schutz had"  Hannover Papers vol x Bothmar No  January th "I judge of Oxford's intentions from the pains which he takes to avoid you You cannot be too diffident of him and you must take care that we are not duped by him We may depend upon it that Oxford is too far engaged with France and the Queen to dare to be able to withdraw and even though he inclined it it would be impossible for him to bring back the Queen to proper measures so that all he would gain would be to meet with the same fate with Godolphin and Marlborough  On this account and with this precaution the attentions which you propose to show to that minister and the manner in which you intend to behave to the Queen's ministers in general are greatly approved of here and it gives great satisfaction that you are agreeable to Halifax and other friends  With regard to the pension we think here that Sunderland and Somers reason much better on the subject than Halifax for upon the supposition which is but too probable of the lord treasurer's intentions the great aim should be to unmask him and the other ministers publickly and to open the eyes of the nation which cannot be done but by the means of some such business as this brought before the parliament whereas whatever the Queen's ministers may be entreated to obtain from France about the removal of the Pretender or to add to the Barrier Treaty will not strike the people and will be liable to chicane and consequently now when the nation is alarmed on all sides with the Pretender is the proper time to bring an affair of this kind before the parliament  I refer myself on this subject to the rescript which you will receive signed by our master and add only that Bernsdorf in particular recommends to you strongly what regards Argyle and his brother and to see if by the hopes you shall give them both of a pension in case the parliament by their interest shall grant a pension to the Electress you can obtain some important service from them This in reality is a capital point  If Oxford continues to avoid you as I imagine he will and if Bolingbroke does so likewise you need not be afraid of giving offence to the Whigs by your familiarity with these ministers I have no hopes of our arrears  You will see by the rescript of our master that lord Halifax's advice concerning the Barrier Treaty and the sending the Pretender into Italy has been entirely followed and that it is wished you would propose to our friends to move in parliament for a bill to exclude him in case of his conversion  Be so good as to thank lord justice Parker for his good advice and how him that it has been regarded What does Nottingham do Have you seen L'Hermitage His Electoral Highness recommends to you in a very particular manner the article which regards the duke of Argyle and to make his compliments to his Grace  The Chevalier de Reden told me the other day that the Electress said lately more than once at a full table that she had sent you a new regency reproaching herself for having put in so many Whigs You see how we are placed Judge if Mr Winde and secretary D'Alais would neglect to write this to London and is it not possible that the knowledge which the Queen's ministers have of it may occasion the objections they propose to make to the registration and have suggested these good advices from the Whigs"  Copy of the Rescript signed by the Elector as mentioned above  "We understand with pleasure by your private letters that the duke of Argyle and his brother appeared disposed to court your acquaintance and to give proofs of their zeal The credit of his Grace must naturally be so great in Scotland after the death of the Queen that you can never pay too much attention to any favourable dispositions which he may discover to you You will assure him of the very particular regard we have for his person and also for his brother If you observe that they act sincerely we believe you may entreat them when the proper time comes to employ their credit to get an act settling a pension on the Electress passed in parliament promising in case the affair succeeds to give them from that fund pensions proportioned to the importance of  the service they will render her You will easily comprehend that you must make these promises in the name of the Electress"  "I must tell you" continues Robethon in a postscript to de Grote "by order of our ministers who have all signed the minute of this rescript that the Elector approves very much of the contents but said that it was the Electress who should sign it The ministers did not at all choose to speak about it to the Electress because the affair would undoubtedly be very soon made public They entreat you however to conform yourself entirely to this rescript being very well persuaded that instead of being disavowed you will be commended by the Electress if the affair of the pension succeeds It is in this case clear that Argyle and his brother are to be rewarded with pensions"  Hannover Papers vol x Bothmar No  January "Your delivering our remarks on the barrier treaty with regard to the quarantee of our succession is much approved of here I see the lord treasurer seemed to pay some attention to them We must wait the issue You are desired to insist that the Pretender may be mentioned in that treaty and mentioned under the title of the person who usurps the name and dignity of James the Third King of Great Britain and that it may be added that it is principally against him that the Queen requires of the States to quarantee the succession established in the house of Hannover  All your reflections concerning a design of a bill to exclude the Pretender and other Papists in case they turn Protestants are approved of The ministers make this additional reflection that it would call our right in question by supposing that there were cases in which that right might be doubtful and require explanation which we must never suppose or put in question The Pretender's being excluded and abjured after the strongest form in all cases and without restriction or reserve should be sufficient You are therefore desired to drop the design of speaking of it to our friends much less to the Queen's ministers I imagine Halifax will be of this opinion"  Ibid No  February "I see lord Bolingbroke has declared himself sufficiently concerning the guarantee of the succession in the barrier treaty I allow him that an Englishman should not consent to tye up the hands of future parliaments by a treaty but that is not the question  here he leads you into an error for the point in question now is whether the States  by the present treaty are to guarantee the succession only as it is settled in the Electoral family or whether they are to guarantee to infinity whatever the Queen or her parliament may choose to determine hereafter concerning the succession of the crown The council sat yesterday his Electoral Highness refused the  l  to the Examiner but all the ministers

lose no time in communicating to him the resolution of his Electoral Highness in his favour providing at least he has not already absolutely changed sides which I do not expect The flying post will have  l  and not  l  sterling as I was told at first  When you bring the affair of the pension for the Electress on the carpet please tell  o probably Oxford that his relation who was at Hannover assured the Electress frequenlly that there was nothing more just that the lord treasurer would contribute to it with all his power and he himself also It will be proper to put both the one and the

would have accomplished their design much sooner  That lord Oxford is devoted irrecoverably to the Pretender and to the King of France is what we had no doubts of long ago although his cousin when he was at Hannover endeavoured to impose in that respect upon the Electress and the Electoral Prince with whom I did not choose to dispute the subject for they would not have failed to reproach me with my partiality for the Whigs and I choose rather to wait until your Excellency having observed the matter yourself should bear testimony to this incontestible truth  With regard to the project of going over with a body of troops now to England Monsieur de Bernsdorff would have wished that all that passage had been written in cyphers rather than any other and his Excellency orde  me to tell you that as that design requires absolutely the concurrence of the States General and their men of war it is impossible to think of it at present since the States General give their whole attention now to hasten the peace and to gain the good graces of the Queen and of her ministry imagining they have done enough for us when they signed the treaty guaranteeing the succession We must therefore according to Mr de Bernsdorff give time to the States General and to the  English nation to be sensible of the pernicious consequences of the peace and then we may take juster measures  The question is if the King of France will not in the mean time establish the Pretender by force but how can we do otherwise If the Queen dies before the Pretender arrives all things will be easier and the States will be obliged by their guarantee to assist us But it is the opinion of Monsieur de Bernstorff that if it was necessary during the Queen's life time to take such measures against her Majesty and her ministers we would meet with terrible difficulties from the party in the nation who love the Queen besides it is almost certain the Elector in that case will never bring himself to such a resolution This your Excellency will very easily conceive but we have every reason to hope that in case of the Queen's death the Elector will do whatever can be expected from him of which your Excellency may if you please give assurances to our friends  Monsieur de Bernstorff judges the scheme of having ships of war from the King of Denmark totally impossible"  Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  February "With regard to the long dispatches you sent from the Hague by general Schulenburg what they contain concerning the sentiments of Oxford and Bollingbroke towards the Pretender was well known here already and it will be a foundation to go upon for the future but it is not at all admitted that the sentiments of those two Jacobite lords must be attributed to the memorial of Monsieur de Bothmar And with regard to the proposals of the Whigs contained in the end of these dispatches" viz the sending over troops to England "I must refer myself to what I had the honour of writing to you about them the thing being impracticable without the concurrence of the States General upon which we cannot depend at present  It is principally in the name of the Electress that your Excellency must negociate the affair of the pension and it is much wished here that you may present the memorial you have ready on the subject before the session of parliament begins Your Excellency will undoubtedly put the lord treasurer in mind that his cousin assured the Electress more than once that the affair of the pension was very reasonable and could not be refused promising that he himself would forward it when he returned and assuring her Electoral Highness that the lord treasurer would exert himself in it very willingly"  Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  February "You are desired to propagate in conversation and to publish in the Flying Post with reflections suitable to the subject that a cardinal's hat has been given to the abbé de Polignac on the nomination of the Pretender as King of England This act as a King and as a Popish King should not recommend him to the nation"  Ibid No  March "We are very well pleased here that you have delivered to the lord treasurer the two memorials one concerning the pension of the Electress and the other concerning the removal of the Pretender It is evident from the verbose manner which the treasurer uses in the writing which he delivered to you that he wants to confine himself to general terms which signify nothing I am not afraid that you will take them for current coin"  Ibid No  March "Yesterday secretary D'Alais presented a memorial by order of lord Bolingbroke bearing that Mr Mac Cartney having assassinated the Duke of Hamilton her Britannick Majesty intreats his Electoral Highness in case that man comes here to arrest him and deliver him to the Queen The answer was that they heard nothing of him and that it was not likely he would come here Your Excellency will be pleased to confine yourself to that answer if they speak to you on the subject"  The two following Extracts have no date  Ibid No  "The Elector wishes much that you would acquaint general Mac Cartney's friends that they should write to him to come by no means to Hannover for that would be a very great misfortune and embarassment to the Elector at this juncture and might set him at variance irretrievably with the Queen This is strongly recommended to you I also write about it by order of his Electoral Highness to the baron de Bothmar and to the duke of Marlborough"  "Monsieur de Bernstorff orders me to repeat to you that the project of going over with a body of troops now into England is absolutely impracticable because the thing is impossible without the ships of the States General who are very far from being disposed at present to embark in such an affair and indeed it is all they could do if they saw the Pretender actually in England They are afraid for themselves As  long then as the Queen lives and the Pretender is out of England and while the Queen makes no direct attack upon the rights of her Electoral Highness it is not to be imagined that the Elector will enter into the measures proposed by the Whigs who are generally too sanguine  Monsieur de Bernstorff is very angry to find by Monsieur de Bothmar's letters that the Whigs communicated schemes of this kind to general Schulenburgh It is probable he will not make a proper use of this confidence and that abbé Passionei the Pope's nuntio at Utrecht being his intimate friend is informed of it by this time  The Electress and the Electoral Prince are entirely undeceived in their opinion of lord Oxford since his fine discourse to your Excellency about the pension of the Electress They could have wished here that at the first conversation in which your Excellency spoke to lord Oxford of the pension you had delivered to him the memorial on the subject because lord Oxford not relishing it and the memorial being presented to him however after it was known that he received it unwillingly would say perhaps that we wanted to vex him but to this in my opinion no attention should be paid at all in this affair nor in that of removing the Pretender"  Original Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  A Memorial sent to the Baron de Grote  from Hannover the th of March  From the Elector's ministers asking the opinion of their friends in England concerning the measures to be taken upon the Queen's death  Translation  "THE Queen's situation obliges us to desire you to ask the answer of lord Sunderland lord Somers lord Halifax and lord Townshend to what follows  What are the steps in general which we should take here after we have received the news of the Queen's death  What procurations patents or orders should we have ready to be sent then wherever it will be necessary  Mr Bernstorff is of opinion that in case of the Queen's death as the Electress cannot set out immediately nor travel with the necessary dispatch the Elector or on his refusal the Electoral Prince should set out  for London without the loss of a moment and that on the first news of the Queen's death ships should be kept in readiness in Holland for the security of his passage  We ask in that case  What kind of procuration should the Elector or the Electoral Prince have from the Electress How far should it extend Should it authorize him to disolve the parliament and to call another to dispose of all places to imprison suspected persons c  We ask If the Electress after the Queen's death can establish until she arrives in London a different regency from that which is appointed in the instruments now in England or at least add to it or retrench from it as she chuses  In case the Queen dies before your Excellency has changed the instruments can you still establish as regents the lords named in the last instruments and make them valid  Can the Electress after the Queen's death authorise the Elector to dismiss this regency and take the government into his own hands composing his privy council of such persons as he shall think deserving  If it is necessary that the regency should subsist until the Electress arrives we ask what share of the government can the Elector or the Electoral Prince have jointly with the regents  At the same time that the Electress sets out for London Monsieur de Bernstorff would have the Electoral Prince or duke Ernest to repair to Ghent Bruges and Dunkirk in order to secure those three towns place good governours in them and administer oaths to the English troops which garrison them  We ask how should the order be drawn out which the Electress will give to the prince whom we shall charge with this commission  M de Bernstorff wants that Mr Cadogan should be at hand to go over to England upon the first notice of the Queen's death furnished with the necessary orders from the Electress for taking the oaths of the troops in England breaking the suspected officers filling up their places securing the tower of London c We would choose to have these orders for Mr Cadogan with patents of the offices which will be given  to him ready in the hands of the baron de Bothmar in Holland Bothmar will speak on this subject to Cadogan who goes to Holland now from the duke of Marlborough  We shall endeavour to know from the duke of Marlborough by the means of Cadogan what part he would choose to act in case of the Queen's death If he would go directly to London being one of the regents or go along with the Elector Robethon hath already written that it is desired here that he should stay within reach and that instead of going to live at Francfort he should settle at Wezel  Lastly we ask similar explanations concerning the internal affairs of the kingdom with regard to the great offices which must be disposed of in order that we might have the patents ready and with regard to every thing else which our friends will judge necessary We must have some form of the patents for great offices  We ask if the Queen being dead the Electress should write to the lord mayor of London and in what strain"  A copy of the preceding Queries was sent to Bothmar  Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  at the Hague to be communicated to Mr Cadogan who was to come to Holland on a commission from the duke of Marlborough and Bothmar in a letter to Robethon  Ibid No  on the th and in a postscript to it on the th of March gives him Cadogan's and Marlborough's answer to these queries  It was the duke's opinion that the Elector should go to England immediately upon the Queen's death with full powers from the Electress as her lieutenant general The Kings of England he said frequently invested lieutenants to govern the kingdom in their absence with all the authority and power they possessed themselves  Cadogan thought that the Electoral Prince should not go to take the command of the English troops on the continent but that Bothmar should provisionally have powers in his hands to authorize the duke of Marlborough and himself Cadogan to secure these troops and the fortresses they garrison If the Electress did not choose to sign a commission of that kind it would be sufficient to have one signed by the Elector in her name The troops upon seeing a parchment with the great seal of his Electoral Highness would readily obey a man so agreeable to them as the duke of Marlborough It was not necessary to follow  the form used in commissions of that kind in England nor to write one in English The duke of Marlborough's commission and his own were in England and he could not send copies of them but it would be sufficient to say in the new patent that he was now invested with the same powers he had formerly from the Queen  When the duke of Marlborough was sure of the fidelity of the troops abroad he might follow the Elector into England and leave the Electoral Prince with Cadogan to command the troops  Cadagon thought it was very necessary that he himself should have the commission of lieutenant general and governour of the tower under the duke of Marlborough or the Electoral Prince Bothmar however was not thoroughly convinced of that necessity  Cadogan gave Bothmar the character of some officers Colonel Cholomondely who commanded the second battalion of Guards which went back to England was attached to the Protestant succession and the two battalions officers and men might be depended upon Major general Sabin who commanded at Ghent a timid man but well affected at the bottom and might be managed Brigadier Sutton who commanded at Bruges was entirely dependent on the ministry but to make amends colonel Hill who commanded the regiment of royal Scots might be depended on The commandant at Dunkirk a Scotchman and two battalions of that nation were thorough Jacobites but the eight English battalions were well affected and would give a very good account of the other two and of their commandant  Cadogan concluded with recommending from the duke of Marlborough that his Electoral Highness should have some one with the Pretender to send exact and speedy intelligence of every thing that happened The duke offered to find a proper person if the Elector would lay out fifty louisd'ors a month and in the mean time he would endeavour to have some news of what was done openly at the Pretender's court  Bothmar writes in his postscript that Cadogan approved of the commissions sent to Marlborough and to himself he gives it as his opinion that Cadogan should be employed to command the troops abroad that there might be an opportunity of doing something at home for Mr Stanhope who was well affected and a man of abilities  "Mr Cadogan" says Bothmar "has named to me the three correspondents who may be employed to procure intelligence of the Pretender  One of the magistrates of Huy who is a capital enemy of the Jesuits and is for that reason called the messenger of the Jansenists  An Irish officer of the name of Carol who professes the Popish religion but is a Protestant in his heart and who has friends and relations at the Pretender's court  A Lorrain gentleman who served in the army and whose name was Remiremont He had forgot his real name  These correspondents are to address their letters to M Sapporin director general of the postoffice at Brusselles who will send them to me to the Hague The three together will cost sixty louisd'ors a month"  Intelligence concerning the Pretender  Baron de Grote fell sick at this time and Robethon corresponded with Galke the secretary of the Embassy In a letter dated the st of March he communicated to him the following intelligence he had received from Paris concerning the Pretender  Translation  Original Hannover papers vol marked Bothmar No  "THE affairs of the Prince of Wales clear up from day to day It appears that abandoning his religion for his interest he is resolved to be of the church of England He left all the Roman Catholicks with the Queen his mother at St Germains None but Protestants are about him at Bar except lord Middleton who turned Roman Catholick in France from mere policy He is a man of merit and of all those who followed King James he is the only one whose desertion gave uncasiness to the government at that time The address of the city of Perth in Scotland has no doubt been sent to you it is the more remarkable that the deputies who brought it to London were presented by lord Oxford The duke of Shrewsbury must make a very poor figure in all this affair It appears the ministry sent him to France merely  to keep him at a distance from business  The correspondents of the Stuarts say just the same thing  since every thing is transacted by the means of Mr Prior"  There are several letters from Robethon to Galke about this time But they principally regard the affairs of Germany Denmark and Sweden In a postscript to one of them dated the th of March he desires him to communicate the inclosed intelligence to M de Grote It is in Schrader's hand and marked on the top in Robethon's hand  "communicated by my lord Marlborough to Monsieur Bothmar"  Original Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No    "Intelligence come from Father Ernest Dean of the Cathedral of Tournay"  Translation  "A Person of distinction who lives near Furnes being at Dunkirk in company with the commandant Sir James Abercromby and the commandant looking upon this gentleman as a subject of the King of France's and as attached to his interests told him that he had just received a letter from major general Hill governour of Dunkirk in which he informs him that the disturbances in England and the credit of the Whigs increased to such a degree that there will be a necessity perhaps of asking succours from France and that for that reason Dunkirk will not be demolished because it is the most convenient part for embarking these succours"  "This gentleman from Furnes wrote these particulars to a friend at Brusselles who showed the letter to father Ernest"  "Father Ernest wishes his name may be concealed but he will continue to write every thing he can learn concerning this affair"  Intelligence concerning the Pretender  Translation  Ibid No  It is marked on the top in Robethon's hand "communicated to M de Bothmar by my lord Marlborough"  "THE duke of Lorrain upon frequent solicitations from the Pretender and an order from the court of France has been obliged to write to his Imperial Majesty for two passports for the Pretender one  for going to the waters of Aix la Chapelle in the month of August next and the other for going to reside afterwards at Liege or Cologn The Pretender has asked these passports and is to go to Liege or Cologn by the advice of his friends and of the very ministry in England In case the Emperor refuses these passports the Pretender will go to reside at the Abbacy of St Miel on the banks of the Maese and frontiers of Lorrain He has very weak lungs and will not return to Bar where the air is too sharp for him He is now at Commercy and has in his suite the earl of Middleton lord Edward the son of the duke of Perth Mr Strickland Mr Mac Donald Mr Floyd"  "They are so very silent about every thing done in England that a gentleman about the Pretender having said to one of the court of Lorrain that their affairs went very well in London and this discourse having been reported to lord Middleton was dismissed and sent back to Paris"  "Mr Seldon formerly governour to the Pretender having quarrelled with lord Middleton is likewise sent back to Paris Five persons lately come from England had secret conferences with the Pretender and my lord Middleton They concealed their names and the object of their journey so carefully that it was impossible to discover either the one or the other It was remarked however that they were received with distinction and that the passports in question were asked soon after their departure"  "The affair of the passports was trusted to a very few persons and as this is a fact about which information may be got at the court of Vienna the person who gives this intelligence refers to that circumstance as a proof that he is in a situation to be well instructed in the demands and designs of the Pretender's friends"  Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  The Earl of Sunderland to Monsieur de Bothmar  Inclosing an answer to the memorial inserted above and forms of commissions He proposes to the Elector to send the Electoral Prince to England  Translation  SIR  London  April  "I Embrace this opportunity of a secret conveyance to send you the answer to the memorial you sent me some time ago This answer was drawn up by lord chief justice Parker with the advice of lord  Somers and lord Cowper You will find in it a very clear description of all that the Electress may do when the event happens  "I send you likewise the form of a commission in Latin for constituting the Elector or the Electoral Prince after the Queen's death  Custos regni  and justiciary of the kingdom in the name of the Electress This commission was drawn up by these three persons with great care There are besides two other commissions one in Latin for a lord lieutenant of Ireland and the other in English for a captain general such as the Duke of Marlborough has been I shall send you likewise in a few days a commission of high admiral and one of lord treasurer and I hope that will be sufficient to instruct the court of Hannover in every thing they can do after the Queen's death and before the successor arrives here"  "Since it is so difficult for the Elector to contribute to the expence of the ensuing elections all friends agree to make another proposal to him which is of greater consequence and which appears to them to be absolutely necessary It is to send over the Electoral Prince It is true an invitation by a vote of parliament was formerly spoke of but all friends are unanimously of opinion that such an invitation in the present situation of affairs in such a parliament and under the influence of such a ministry is impracticable"  "They are of opinion that the Electoral Prince being a peer of the realm and his precedency as a prince of the blood having been regulated by act of parliament has so many just pretexts and reasons for coming that those who should oppose him would thereby do themselves the greatest injury which their greatest enemies could wish them If the Elector will consent to this point it will give such support to the friends of the succession that the other affair of the money will not be necessary This is the unanimous opinion of all friends and they have charged me to write it to you"  "We have a fleet of ships of the line ready here It is not pretended any longer that it is for the Baltick The treasurer said three days ago that it was intended for an expedition of quite different importance"  Original Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  The same to the same  The same subject continued  April th  HE had sent the preceding letter with the commissions c by a gentleman belonging to the deceased baron de Grote He promises again in this letter to send the other commissions soon and urges by a repetition of his former arguments the necessity of sending over the Electoral Prince "as a sure and easy and as perhaps the only means of saving the succession This journey must not be delayed in hopes of an invitation which is absolutely impracticable If the prince was once here it is the opinion of all his friends that they would easily obtain any pension they would choose and in a manner suitable to the dignity of the family  With regard to the removing the prince of Wales they will not fail to propose it in the strongest manner in parliament If they carry it it will be a great point gained if they lose it it will be so much the worse for those who shall oppose them for they shall be exposed thereby to the indignation of the people in the elections"  Robethon after his translation of these letters for the Elector's perusal adds "These two letters were written by lord Sunderland to Mons de Bothmar when he sent him the answer to his questions and the patents he asked Mr D'Oynhausen brought them all I have made the inclosed translation of the answer to the questions I don't send the forms of the patents to your Electoral Highness as they are written in Latin and with so many abbreviations that it is difficult to read them but copies shall be written of them"  Besides Robethon's translation the original of the answers is extant as follows  Ibid No  Answers to the Questions of the Memorial inserted above drawn up by the Elector's friends in England and sent by Lord Sunderland to the Baron de Bothmar at the Hague  "THE following considerations will possibly furnish a more clear and useful answer to the queries proposed than strictly pursuing the order of the queries and breaking that which will be offered into separate answers to each distinct particular  The instrument for nominating lords justices ought to be sealed up and deposited with the archbishop c during her Majesty's life or their validity will be too doubtful to be depended upon for the instruments already sealed up and deposited are effectual appointments of lords justices until revoked or altered and when there is an intention to revoke or alter them the Act page appoints a particular method how that is to be effected by three writings under hand and seal requiring them to be delivered up and till that be done by the express words of the Act page the instruments sealed up and deposited as aforesaid are those which are directed to be brought before the privy council there to be opened and read and afterwards to be inrolled in Chancery And therefore as often as it shall be thought fit to make any alteration in the three instruments it ought to be kept in mind that the alteration is incompleat and that nothing is in effect done till the old instruments are taken up and the new sealed up and deposited in their place and that during the Queen's life in Robethon's hand  In case of the demise of her Majesty the regency established by the act of parliament may be entirely abolished by the successor before her or his arrival in Great Britain The Kings and Queens of England have by the common law a power to constitute a regency in their absence in such manner as is aforementioned and this regency established by this act was not intended as any diminution of the royal power but is merely provisional to prevent an interregnum before the successor could arrive in person or constitute a regency and when either of those things happen the end designed by it is fully attained accordingly by the express words of the Act in the clause page which makes the seven officers lords justices they are appointed lords justices and impowered to execute all acts of government no longer than until such successor shall arrive or otherwise determine their authority And by the next clause the persons nominated in the three instruments are only to be added to the seven and to act with them as lords justices as fully and in the same manner as if they had been particularly named in the Act and consequently their authority will be liable to be determined in the same manner as the authority of the seven who are particularly mentioned  But whether some of the regents may be removed from the regency after they have once entered upon it without abolishing the whole is  doubtful The successor's arrival of course determines the authority of them all and whether the power of determining their authority otherwise as the words of the act run mean not a like determination of the authority of them all is not clear enough to be depended upon in a matter of this consequence It is yet more doubtful whether those who are lords justices by virtue of the act either the seven officers or those named in the three instruments can act together with any others to be added anew to them by the successor after they shall have entered upon their office  Therefore in case it should be thought requisite to remove any of the old or to add any new the safest way will be to determine the whole regency and constitute one or more person or persons lord justice or lords justices with or without restraints and with such directions as shall be thought fit  The successor's power to determine the authority of the lords justices appointed by the act before her arrival in Great Britain supposes the power to appoint  a new one or new ones by the common law  And in case of the demise of her Majesty during the life of the Electress it is agreeable to law and seems in itself proper and requisite that she should appoint the Elector her son or the Electoral Prince her grandson Lord Justice of Great Britain  Custos Regni et Locum tenens  with power and directions in case he shall see it fit and convenient to dissolve and determine the privy council and appoint a new one to dissolve the parliament and call a new one to remove all officers and dispose of all offices and employments in the disposal of the crown which will extend to those of the seven regents not for life and to execute and do all other acts of government in the name and stead of the new succeeding Queen as if she were present in person That she may do this before her arrival in Great Britain is plain because it is a proper regal act often done by the Kings of England and the clause page which gives force and effect to such seal as the succeeding Queen or King shall make use of to affix to any instrument to execute and do any regal act proves that such succeeding Queen or King may do regal acts before her or his arrival in Great Britain That the privy council may be determined appears page where it is continued six months unless sooner determined by the next successor  That all officers not for life may be removed and others put in their places appears by the same clause and it is to be noted that in that clause concerning the continuance of officers of the privy council all the officers appointed regents except the archbishop and the chief justice are expresly named Therefore it is to be observed they may be removed from their offices though it be doubtful whether they can be removed from the regency while it continues and it seems plain that the removal of them from their offices does not of itself remove them from the regency nor will their successors become lords justices in virtue of their succeeding to those offices for the regency is not annexed to their offices to go along therewith but page the seven officers afternamed who shall be in possession of their offices at the time of such demise of her Majesty are appointed lords justices until the successor shall arrive or otherwise determine their authority where it appears that those who shall succeed to those offices are not within the words to be lords justices because not in possession of those offices at the time of the demise of her Majesty and those who were in possession at the time of such demise are continued until the successor arrive or otherwise determine not their offices but their authority  i e  their authority of lords justices  That the parliament may be dissolved is certain and may be collected from page where the regents constituted lords justices by the act are restrained from dissolving the parliament without express direction from such succeeding Queen or King therefore by such direction those lords justices may dissolve it and much more therefore may another lord justice appointed by the succeeding Queen or King not under the restraints laid by the act upon the provisional regency  The prince so appointed lord justice  Custos regni et locum tenens  may by virtue thereof take upon him the whole government and upon his so doing and producing his patent the regency appointed by the act will be determined However it may be proper to have an express clause for determining the regency inserted in the patent to prevent all doubts in that case and nothing more is requisite to the abolishing the regency  The acts done by such lord justice pursuant to his authority will in law be the acts of the sovereign however the privy council the parliament  and officers being appointed to continue for some time unless sooner determined dissolved or removed by the next successor To leave no room for doubt it may be proper to insert express powers and directions for the lord justice to dissolve and determine the privy council to dissolve the parliament and to remove officers if he shall see fit  The removing of any officers in the disposition of the crown and appointing new ones is a regal act which may be done abroad taking care to declare of what effect the seal whereby the instrument is sealed shall be And as to offices to be executed in Great Britain the instrument granting the office or directing the regents to grant the office may be sent over before the next successor or the  Custos regni  can arrive consequently a captain general may be abroad appointed to command the forces abroad and to secure their fidelity c  The regency will have power sufficient as to the forces in Great Britain but yet the successor may appoint a captain general for them too if it shall be thought requisite  A particular power to seize and imprison suspected persons will be neither necessary nor useful the ordinary magistrates have sufficient powers for that purpose  It is to be observed once for all that any dormant instrument for any of the purposes aforesaid sealed during her Majesty's life will be of no force by the laws of Great Britain"  Original Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  The Duke of Marlborough to the Elector  He thanks the

Cowper and the lord justice Parker consulted together for two days but could not contrive any probable means of preventing the consequences of the treasurer's designs The two first lords came twice to Kreyenberg in the name of the rest to represent that it was necessary the Elector should take some step that would undeceive the nation Kreyenberg proposed that they themselves should make some motion in parliament which they knew the ministry would reject This would discover the insincerity of their protestations They answered that the ministry would then represent them as seditious in the eyes of the nation who believed implicitly the Queen's declaration and as designing to create a misunderstanding between the two courts and they gave it as their opinion that the Electoral Prince should take advantage of the Queen's declaration and come over to England which would greatly embarrass the ministry"  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  Letters from M l'Hermitage  The Queen's speech was

dined together on Thursday at my lord Halifax's have given me in charge to tell you that there will be no resource unless the Electoral Prince is sent over soon All these fine compliments to the Electoral family which are contained in the Queen's speech and in the address of the two houses should encourage your  court to approve of this journey and they furnish the most natural pretext in the world which is to come in person to acknowledge thankfully such obliging declarations and pretend to consider them as very sincere for it is but just to pay the dissimulation of the Queen and of the treasurer in the same coin And his Electoral Highness cannot but be sensible of the unbecoming manner in which they treat him by publishing from the throne that they do nothing but in concert with him while they neglect to give the least answer to the two memorials presented by the deceased M de Grote concerning the removal of the Pretender and the pension of the Electress and while they sacrifice entirely at Utrecht the interests of his electorate and of his office as high treasurer of the empire  At any rate here is the finest opportunity in the world to catch lord Oxford in his own snare It

either the invitation of the parliament which is not to be expected from a parliament so ill composed as the present or the permission of the Queen which most assuredly she will not grant if it is asked He is entirely at liberty to come of his own accord being naturalized and being duke of Cambridge and a member in the house of peers and his rank as prince of the blood being settled The Queen herself cannot forbid him according to the laws neither to come into the kingdoms nor to take his seat in parliament and her Majesty and her ministers after such public and solemn declarations which the Queen and the two houses have lately made cannot retract themselves and will be obliged to receive the prince well while every one will turn to him as to the rising sun seeing the Queen's health is so broken  My lord Halifax told me that the friends would by no means propose in parliament that it would be necessary to have some one of the Electoral family in this country for that would be questioning a right which your princes have obtained and give a handle to parliament to take in that respect some improper resolution which might render the coming of the prince more difficult neither will they speak of the pension  for the Electress but I believe they will bring the removal of the Pretender upon the carpet  The friends are very desirous that the Elector should immediately resolve to send over the prince in order that he may arrive during the present session of parliament which will not continue but two months and may take his seat in the house of peers not in order to vote with the Whigs and against the court but in order to take possession of what is due to him and to convince the nation of the falsehood of the rumours they circulated that the Elector is indifferent about the crown of England For in other respects our friends agree that the Prince should make his court to the Queen pay attention to the ministers caress every one without distinction of party and refrain from coming to the house when party questions are debated since he would be obliged if he came on such occasions to vote either against the court or against the friends of the succession  That the nation is for the Electoral family and against the Pretender is evident now to a demonstration since the court imagines they cannot carry the ensuing elections but by means of her Majesty's declarations in favour of the family and the members of the house of commons that they may be chosen again for the next parliament cover themselves in their addresses with the same mask of a pretended zeal for the protestant succession an example which will be followed in all the addresses that will be presented on the peace from all parts of the kingdom  The lord treasurer publishes every where in the counties that his Electoral Highness is in perfect concert with the Queen and will be very well pleased that the members recommended by the court should be chosen This artifice succeeds to the treasurer's satisfaction in many places and as he has besides money to lay out and is very liberal of it on such occasions the Whigs are discouraged thereby from offering themselves to be chosen from the fear of being disappointed So that there is a danger of having a new parliament as devoted to the ministers as the present after which these ministers being absolute masters for three years will easily accomplish their pernicious designs and establish the Pretender in this country  The presence of the Electoral Prince in the kingdom  will be sufficient to defeat this plan of the ministers It will encourage the Whigs to get themselves chosen and they will chearfully take upon themselves all the expence of the elections without asking any thing from his Electoral Highness The presence of the prince will alone have a mighty influence on the elections and gain over to the wellaffected party an infinite number who follow the court only because they are not supported by the successor and are in the mistaken notion of the Elector's neglecting the affairs of England All these fears will vanish Every one will attach himself to the prince and by that means we shall have a good parliament after which his Electoral Highness may decide in it as he chooses both with regard to the affairs of the succession and the affairs of Europe  The sending the Electoral Prince then is an infallible remedy against present evils and against such as are dreaded hereafter It is easy it is natural it is unexpensive and without any risk in the present conjuncture insomuch that I cannot conceal from you that if our friends who ask it with so much earnestness see they are refused they will believe themselves absolutely abandoned they will hope for no further resource they will lose courage and take their own measures  Lord Halifax would have the prince to come post with a valet de chambre and two footmen under another name without his order of the garter and without liveries and take his passage in the pacquet boat with a passport from lord Strafford procured under a borrowed name The rest of his servants and baggage would follow In short the only question is to come speedily and secretly and every thing will go well"  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  A Letter from M l'Hermitage  London  May th  THE Electoral Prince should come of his own accord The present parliament will never invite him The Queen will be angry if they should force her to invite him and if the parliament should reject a motion of addressing the Queen to invite him the prince could not come again with any propriety whereas no one can take it amiss if he should come in consequence of the Queen's speech It is necessary either to send the prince or to undeceive the nation by a manifesto denying the good understanding which the Queen pretends to subsist between her  and the Electoral family But this last measure will occasion an open rupture with the Queen and may be attended with a thousand inconveniencies "Send over therefore the prince for the safety of England or to speak more properly of Europe and your own safety is at stake for if you abandon the crown to the Pretender you cannot save yourselves The prince should have letters from the Elector and from the Electress for the Queen and likewise for the treasurer and the letters for him must be very flattering testifying the greatest confidence in him and entreating him to direct and guide the prince"  Original draught Hannover Papers vol marked Strafford  Extract of a letter from the Princess Sophia to the Earl of

Queen does me the justice to believe that I do not pretend to enjoy the good effects of it myself I therefore hope that her Majesty will have no aversion to me on that account and that she will be persuaded that I shall be attached to her with all imaginable respect as long as I live I have been much scandalized by a book which has been sent to me called "Freethinker" Although it is very natural for every one to think as he chooses yet in a wellgoverned state every one should not have the liberty of publishing his opinion and I imagine that is not allowed in England Poor Mr D'Alais is

"IT was Marlborough's opinion and also the opinion of all friends in England that the Electoral Prince should go over under the pretext of thanking the Queen for the affection she expressed in her speech towards the Elector's family "They wrote to me that there was the greatest difficulty imaginable in determining the Queen to mention the serene family at all in her speech and that she did not consent to it but after the strongest representations that it was absolutely necessary in order to quiet the minds of the people and to succeed in the elections for the ensuing parliament"  Bothmar had always dissuaded their friends from insisting on this demand but he was now convinced it was proper to comply with it His presence would animate the Whigs and discourage the Jacobites and disconcert all their measures for bringing in the pretender The prince should embark on board a Danish frigate in the Elbe to avoid inconveniences of going by Holland  Ibid p  A letter from M l'Hermitage  Translation  London  May  A Repetition of the reasons for the prince's coming over He should have letters of thanks from the Elector and Electress to the Queen upon the supposition of a good understanding and likewise letters for the treasurer placing the prince entirely under his direction "This will produce one of two effects If the treasurer pays attention to these recommendations he will ruin his credit with his own party and if he neglects the prince he will lose his credit with the nation This is intimated to you in the name and at the desire of our friends"  Hannover  apers vol marked Schutz fils p  A letter from M l'Hermitage  London  May  IT appears from this letter they apprehended in Hannover that if the prince came over without the Queen's permission he might be sent back with disgrace L'Hermitage assured them that as the prince was a peer of the realm no one would venture to propose such a measure and that it was not even in the Queen's power and besides that the prince's presence would encourage a number of people to declare openly against the court and would influence the ensuing elections in favour of the Whigs  Ibid p  A letter from M l'Hermitage  June  THIS letter was decyphered in a different hand from Robethon's It appears from it that the court of Hannover proposed to send over duke Ernest instead of the Electoral Prince but their friends in England thought that this would neither embarrass Harley nor quiet the nation The presence of the prince they considered to be absolutely necessary as the Scots threatened to break the union This was the opinion of both high and low although they were totally ignorant of its having been ever proposed  Ibid p  A letter from M l'Hermitage  Decyphered by Robethon  Translation  June  "LOrd Anglesea is determined to drive the lord Treasurer to extremities and has been for some time in strict connection with the duke of Argyle This earl is one of the greatest Tories and is not a good tempered man He is very haughty and very ambitious He is one of the most active men in the world and does not deviate an inch from what he hath once undertaken and being very clever there is reason to think that the Treasurer will not consider him as an indifferent enemy and that his hatred will give him room for serious reflections  This nobleman is offended at the haughty manner in which the Treasurer treated him and because he discovered that the Treasurer designs to bring over the Pretender whom he does not favour though he is  deep in all the other schemes of the Tories but it is said he has estates in Ireland which he would be in danger of losing if the Pretender came over  The treasurer has discovered long ago that he is neither loved nor esteemed by any party The affront he lately received when the treaty of commerce was thrown out makes him sensible of the danger to which he is exposed and will hasten the execution of his design of bringing over the Pretender to which the Queen's state of health will be a further inducement The King of France likewise is offended for losing the advantages he would have obtained by that treaty and will contribute every thing in his power to send over the Pretender The presence of the prince is the only remedy against thefe and other evils"  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  A letter from M l'Hermitage  Translation

others The duke of Argyle likewise acts in concert with them and is not idle"  L'Hermitage writes that if they fail their want of success will be imputed to the neglect and indifference of the Elector if they succeed without his assistance there is reason to fear that they will not hereafter show that gratitude or compliance which would be necessary to obtain the emoluments of government which will not perhaps be so considerable The Treasurer having proposed a reconciliation with the Whigs after their fall they assured him that they would willingly renounce all pretensions to offices and support his measures with all their force if he would humble France and free them from their fears of the Pretender But he laughed at their offers and followed a different plan in consequence of which they have constantly opposed him▪ they are determined to do so at the expence of their lives if the Pretender comes and if he does not the Treasurer Bolingbroke and others consider themselves no doubt as threatened with the same danger  These repeated representations from the Hannoverian agents in London  produced at last the following answer It is a copy in Robethon's hand of a letter sent in cyphers

his friends by assisting to carry on the war against France but cannot give money to carry the elections in their favour  Translation  Hannover  July  "HIS Electoral Highness having assured our friends by the late baron de Grote that he will never abandon them and that on the Queen's death he would do every thing which the nation could expect from him and having renewed these assurances after the death of de Grote by his resident Kreyenberg in the strongest and most positive manner it would be surprising that they should doubt of these assurances from a prince who is known to be a religious observer of his word  The Elector does the greatest service to the wellaffected in England which the state of affairs in Europe in general and his own particular situation will allow when he engages the Emperor and the Empire to continue the war against France and employs of his own troops against that kingdom This puts it out of the King of France's power to send an army with the Pretender into England and it is not to be supposed that he will venture to go without a French army since he is proscribed by the laws and has the nation against him If he does will the friends of the succession who are so rich and have so much influence and have the nation and the laws on their side lose courage and submit immediately when their religion their laws their property and their liberties are at stake especially when they are sure of speedy assistance from the Elector The nation must exert itself for the Elector cannot save them against their will  The Elector is at so much expence on the troops he employs on the Rhine that he cannot give the money demanded for the elections Besides he should fail infallibly as the court would always have the heaviest purse and such a measure could never be kept so secret as not to give great offence to the English ministry  There are several objections against sending the Electoral Prince There can be no security for a safe passage It will be impossible for him to go secretly The ministry might put obstacles in his way and they might subject him to mortifications after his arrival The Elector has been so often amused these two years with false intelligence of the Queen's health that he does not know but her death may be still very distant and it would be imprudent in him upon an uncertainty to expose his only son and the only hope of his family"  Before M l'Hermitage received this letter  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p and  he wrote one on the th of July repeating all the reasons he had formerly mentioned for sending over the Electoral Prince and after he had received it he wrote another in the same strain on the st The reasons which the Elector's ministers desire him to communicate to their

on the th  Ibid p  L'Hermitage wrote several letters on the same subject to Bothmar at the Hague  Ibid p  Bothmar sent copies of them decyphered in Schrader's hand to Hannover and marked always in his own hand at the top that they were from l'Hermitage and of such a date L'Hermitage thought the succession would be lost unless the Electoral prince came to England Lord Halifax believed now that  l  sterling instead of the  l  they asked at first would be sufficient to carry the elections against the court and the duke of Argyle told Halifax that with  l  he would answer for all the elections in Scotland  "But there being no further hopes of obtaining these things" says Bothmar "they want that we should prescribe what our friends should do my lord Halifax having told l'Hermitage that they did not know what to do since France will be no sooner delivered from the war of the Empire than the Pretender will be in England and then it will be impossible to answer for any thing But that if the Elector of Brunswick or at least the Electoral Prince could come over this winter he would answer for it that the ministry would be overturned and all things put out of danger"  August Hannover papers vol marked Bothmar No  The Earl of Sunderland to Bothmar  Copy in Schrader's hand The date is in Bothmar's and "Lord Sunderland to Bothmar" in Robethon's  Translation  August  "I Had the honour of your letter of the first of August There is no doubt but that if the Queen happens to die before the ministers here have adjusted their measures with France for bringing over the prince of Wales the friends of the family here will have strength enough to support their cause until the Elector arrives and they are all of opinion that the presence of the Elector would be infinitely more useful than that of the Electoral Prince not only in that case but even at this very time But as they imagine that the Elector would not choose to come before the Queen's death they proposed that the Electoral Prince should come as he has such a just pretext for this which regards himself alone being a peer of the realm and they propose this not only in view of the Queen's dying soon for the danger is then by no means so great but in order to have a support and some one to counteract the designs of the ministry who will use the authority of the Queen while she lives the administration of affairs which the laws place in their hands for concerting such measures with France that the Pretender will be here in an instant and then it will be too late to prevent him  All this is so clear to common sense and must be particularly so to the Elector who knows better than any one the engagements of the ministry with France that it is very surprising he should hesitate a moment and from any jealousy he may have of the Electoral Prince If he will come himself as I had often the honour to tell you all his friends will rejoice at it more than at the coming of the Electoral Prince But if he will neither come himself nor send the Electoral Prince I assure you that all friends of all ranks will consider themselves as abandoned Perhaps this will not be relished at Hannover but I would not be a faithful servant to the Elector and to the Protestant succession if I did not acquaint you with the just state of the affair  We exert ourselves more this session and with greater success than we had reason to expect in hopes that having another parliament we should have some support from your court When it is seen that what  was proposed with regard to money is rejected and that the Elector will neither

want to introduce a new religion There is none that I abhor so much as the Popish for there is none so contrary to Christianity Whoever is a sovereign should never submit himself to the dominion of a foreign power such as the Pope"  The Jew who wrote the following very intelligent and sensible letter gave the Elector a very different account of the state of parties in England from either his own agents or the English noblemen who sent him their opinion and advice It is in Robethon's hand and marked by him at the top  "Translated from Jacob Mears the Jew"  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  Jacob Mears to the Elector  The Earl of Oxford's motives and views  Translation  SIR  Cleves  Sept th  "AS I am encouraged from your Electoral Highness to give my opinion of the affairs of England I shall take the liberty to tell  you that the changes which happened are founded solely upon the enmity of the earl of Oxford against the duke of Marlborough To render that great General useless Oxford advised the Queen to finish the war and conclude a peace with France and to gain the favour of the people he provided for the payment of ten millions of debt by establishing the South Sea company gaining at the same time the Clergy of the church of England by building fifty new churches and by other methods sufficiently known  He hath likewise drawn the Jacobites into his party by conniving at their hopes and at their views for the Pretender in order to alarm thereby your illustrious house But in my humble opinion your Electoral Highness should employ all sorts of means to engage Oxford and his friends in your interests promising to continue them in their offices and to protect them against Marlborough and his adherents after the death of the Queen for I don't believe that lord Oxford and his friends are for the Pretender all he did was from a hatred to Marlborough and to revenge himself of one who had disgraced him with the Queen"  Jacob Mears advises the Elector to employ some men of address in England with powers from him to gain the leaders of the Tories by promises and money who might easily be prevailed upon to abandon the Pretender and would then dispose the Queen to be favourable to his Electoral Highness He thinks the Electoral Prince should go over and gives directions about his behaviour in England  "I submit all this to the great prudence of your Electoral Highness and am always ready to obey your orders and if your Electoral Highness chooses that I should come to Hannover before I go over to England I am ready to obey and to have the honour

Masham"  There are other two letters from Schutz of this date  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p and  one in French to Robethon and one in High Dutch to president Bernsdorff He complains that he frequently spoke to Monsieur Kreyenberg about the lottery tickets belonging to the Electress but without success He believes that Kreyenberg's affairs are in bad order for he owned to him the loss of  l  which he had trusted to Strafford He begs that his own expences should be considered and entitle him to a greater allowance especially as every thing was very dear  "I know too well  Translation from the High Dutch  from experience that when I shall spend all my own little income no one will give me a fortune and if in serving our master with activity and zeal one must ruin his

fortune and his life for his service"  Halifax assured Schutz that the treasurer endeavours to convince every one that the Elector approves of all his measures this prevented the friends of the succession from opposing him "and if he speaks in this strain to a nobleman of lord Halifax's capacity with whom he pretends to converse as a friend and who is considered to have the confidence of the Elector what will he not say to others who he knows are not so well informed These assertions of the treasurer's and the orders which monsieur de Grote had as well as myself to see very few Whigs and but rarely and in secret will render it very difficult to undeceive our friends  "Lord Halifax believes the Queen as well as her ministry is entirely against our succession but he is persuaded that her Majesty far from choosing to yield the crown to the Pretender in her lifetime is no ways disposed as yet to bring him over"  Lord Halifax assured Schutz that it was owing to him alone that the Treaty of Commerce was rejected he was the first who opposed it in the house of peers and he engaged lord Anglesea and others to oppose it in the house of commons "And as he gave me clearly to understand that to sacrifice all his fortune and expose himself to the resentment of France of the Pretender and of the Queen's ministry was playing a very high game until one was well assured that such a conduct was approved could not a letter to him be obtained from the Elector thanking him for his services in the last session begging the continuance of chem and asking his opinion of the state of affairs in this country"  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  Schutz to Robethon  This letter was carried to Hannover by Monsieur de Melleville and was not written in cyphers  Translation

shuffled  i e  for having paid court to the lord treasurer in hopes that he would have made him one of the Scotch peers The misfortune is that he has thereby neglected to be chosen in opposition to the court which the duke thinks he could not have missed to be if he had spoke out and employed the interest of his friends in Scotland They say he is disgusted at having been played the fool with in this manner and disappointed in his hopes and he must have exerted himself very much and with great success though chiefly out of spite in order to carry the elections of the commons in Scotland

the treasurer was not entirely sure and that he broke them when their answers did not please him He behaves in the same manner to those who have other employments  The offer which the elder Mr Murray

the malicious reports which had been made to her of his conduct and he entreated her to let him know what he was accused of that he might exculpate himself by informing her of the truth but having never been able to obtain that favour he conjured her to compare the freedom and the boldness  with which he always told her his opinion concerning affairs in general and concerning his diffidence of some persons who had the honour of approaching her frequently without enjoining secrecy with the manner in which they spoke to her in order to judge who acted most honourably to her But still he had no answer"  "Monsieur de Plessen confirmed the truth of all this to Schutz The duke of Argyle thought it was absolutely necessary to gain lord Anglesey and Sir Thomas Hanmer The friends of the

such a step For he believes them disposed from inclination and duty to favour the Pretender He flatters himself that our affairs are not so desperate as we imagine and that our enemies meet with difficulties which we are ignorant of and which forced them to such a measure In short he hopes whether the Pretender stays in Lorrain or leaves it that means will be found in the ensuing session of parliament to take advantage of this step against them  It was on this occasion the Queen must have written to the Pretender to inform him that it was against her will she took that step assuring him that his interests were always dear to her that she would take all imaginable care of them that it was not yet the time to declare herself and a great deal more in the same strain and even treating

sentiments and thoughts of our friends in England concerning the unhappy condition we are in which I am sorry to tell you grows worse every day and will very soon be desperate unless some speedy remedy is applyed Though the whole conduct of our ministry both as to affaires at home and abroad leaves no rome to doubt of their intentions to bring in the Pretender yet I cannot forbear mentioning some circumstances relating to it which have happened since the last sessions of parliament I shall begin with our court's entering into a stricter and greater union with France than ever notwithstanding the collusive maner with which the French King has evaded executing those articles made with England which were for our advantage and as the highest and most convincing mark of the double dealing and pernicious designs of our ministers I shall in the next place instance their affectation of writting to such princes not to receive the Pretender into whoes countrys they are sure he will never come and their making no step in earned towardes the removing him out of Lorrain notwithstanding the addresses of both houses and that his being there or in France is the same thing by which means the article in the treaty of peace for the security of the Protestant's Succession is eluded to this must be added the giving all employments millitary and civil to notorious Jacobits the putting the governments of Scotland and Ireland into the hands of two persons who are known friends to the Pretender the choosing the lords to serve for Scotland of which two were with the Pretender

freedome of elections all over the kingdome by corruption opression and bribary in order to get such persons chose as are in the interest of the Pretender the animating the clergy to preach up hereditary and testamentary right both which principles are distructive to the succession the encoraging the publishing that pernicious book lately write to support those doctrins which though high treason by our laws yet this book which asserts them was write either by direction or conivence of Ld T as may be judged by the following circumstances First the matterials for it were collect'd either out of manuscripts in his own library or out of such publick recordes as Mr Lowndes was known to have been employed in the serch of Ld Tr library keeper corrected the manuscript and the printing of the book was publish'd in the Gazet and though the printer was taken up for form's sake the sale of the book is openly permitted and great numbers of them sent gratis all over the kingdome Many instances of the same nature might be joyned to these I have mentioned but I think these more then sufficient to demonstrate the views of the ministry and the dainger of delaying any longer the entering into effectual measures for the preventing of them But as this matter is of the highest moment and that the safety of our religon property and liberty will depend upon the resolutions to be now taken our friends in England submit every thing to his Electoral Highness's great wisdom and discretion and will execute with zeal and pleasure whatever instructions or orders he shall please to give them in this most important affaire However they beleive themselves oblidged at the same time both in duty to his Electoral Highness and out of concern for the safety and good of their country to represent in the most humble and submissive maner that considering the present state of things in England nothing can so effectually assure the succession as his Electoral Highness going there or if that can not be hoped for the sending the prince which would animate and encorage to the greatest degree all those of both partys who wish well to the succession and break the measures of those who  are against it  But though this is the unanimous sense of our friends in England yet they leave and wholly submit it to his Electorale Highness prudence and judgement and desire that this their advice

the well affected Tories but he mentioned several other particulars to Bothmar which the latter writes to his correspondent in this letter The Elector should assure the Tories that the Whigs would resign to them offices and employments If the Electoral Prince would go to England there were or great men who would hazard their fortunes and their lives to serve him If the Elector himself would go they would furnish him any sums of money that he should judge necessary for the execution of his designs A proof of the possibility of this was that eight or ten persons were able to furnish the Emperor  with three millions They would furnish money much more readily for the preservation of their own country  They again entreated his Electoral Highness very earnestly to grant the pensions they ask for some poor lords who want necessary subsistence and if they cannot engage his Electoral Highness to agree to any thing they propose they will endeavour to provide for themselves as well as they can and yield to the times "He told me that the dutchess of Marlborough was to return to England in spring and that perhaps the duke would do so likewise for being now years of age it was proper for him to think of dying in peace in his native country if he could If we will do nothing ourselves to secure the succession we cannot expect it without a miracle I am afraid we will not get off with the loss of our hopes of that succession and that so much trouble will be given to us and so many enemies raised against us elsewhere that we will not be either in peace or safety in the Electorate until we shall be so low that they may be assured they have nothing further to apprehend from us"  "You recollect that both the duke of Marlborough and Cadogan have provisional orders from the Electress to take the command of the troops and of garrisons in case of the Queen's death Cadogan told me it would be proper to have a particular one for Mr Armstrong quartermaster general who commands at Dunkirk to seize upon that place and execute the orders of Marlborough or Cadogan That order may remain in the duke of Marlborough's hands until it will be time to execute it which Cadogan answers Armstrong will do although the ministry confide in him He is a creature of Cadogan's who knows that according to the laws such orders are not valid but he says that officers and soldiers so very well affected as they are will not examine the point so narrowly and will be satisfied with seeing the name and the seal of the Electress and when once the thing is done reasons will be easily found afterwards to

thrown so much light on the history of these kingdoms resigned his place of undersecretary The seals being given to Sir Thomas Higgins the correspondence to and from Britain passed through his hands and all the papers are probably still preserved in the Scotch College at Paris That part only of the correspondence with the Pretender which passed through the office of Mr Nairne as secretary of the closet has fallen into the hands of the Editor This deficiency is however very amply supplied by the minute detail of facts contained in the Hannoverian dispatches for the present year  The Pretender having retired from the dominions of France before the conclusion of the peace lived in great security at Barleduc in Lorrain The two houses of parliament instigated by the Whigs who were themselves urged by the house of Hannover presented addresses to the Queen to use her influence with the princes in alliance with Great Britain not to receive him into their dominions These princes however were no strangers to the circumstance that the Queen and even some of her servants desired that he should not be molested She herself had obtained from the French King and by her influence from the Emperor such passports for her brother as justified the reception given to him by the duke of Lorrain The Jacobites in Britain with their usual intemperance and zeal were highly elevated with the hopes of his speedy restoration His health was publickly drunk He was mentioned in common discourse by the title of King and scarce any doubt can be formed that the Queen herself encouraged his hopes and  promoted his views  The respect with which he was received abroad rose in proportion to the favourable appearance of his affairs at home The duke of Lorrain received him with a royal munificence and gave him

speedy answer which I have waited for from day to day but your Royal Highness knows that they are not as expeditious at this court as one could wish Accordingly I have not been able to obtain an answer until last night when the prince sent for me very late to tell me that he had given an account to the Emperor of what I had said to him concerning the Chevalier de St George that his Majesty had appeared to relish the proposal but found the present times too critical to be able to come to a determination adding that he did not believe that it was the interest of the Chevalier de St George to determine any thing positively in the present conjuncture and that he was disposed to give the Chevalier marks of esteem and regard when the occasions offered This in a few words is the answer that was made to me I remarked however in continuing the conversation with the prince of Trauston that far from being averse from this alliance they would desire it much especially if the Chevalier de St George was restored to his dominions as it is not doubted will happen in a short time  This minister found that there was a disproportion of age between the Chevalier de St George and the youngest of the archdutchesses niece to the reigning Emperor and that they would be more inclined to settle the youngest of the archdutchesses his sister the first being only twelve and the last two and twenty years old and it is believed here that the Chevalier de St George is twentyfive The minister strictly enjoined me  to write to your Royal Highness  that you ought to preserve the most profound secrecy in this affair that the present conjuncture requires this on your own account and on account of the Emperor and of the Chevalier de St George that a discovery would infallibly ruin it and that I

has shewn him and he has given me in charge to write to you about this in order that by my orders you might show that he has a grateful sense of the Emperor's behaviour that he has a mutual esteem for him and will seek every opportunity of cultivating that friendship and regard which the Emperor has testified for him He expressed himself in the most obliging terms You will therefore execute this commission as soon as you receive my letter I will even tell you as from myself that I thought I had perceived the Chevalier de St George would have wished that he himself could have written to the

under the feigned name of Lamb was sent for to Barleduc in the room of Mr West who was not so well known Mr Lesly wrote a letter on the subject addressed to a member of parliament It was openly handed

blinded as to make a monster of what is in effect their greatest security and not perceive and endeavour to prevent the real and just causes they have of fear and apprehension  My present sincerity at

the letter which you did me the honour to write to me Behold then at last the period arrived which must decide your fortune You have taken the only proper course by going to Paris and I hope that you will find at the court of France the succours which are necessary for securing the success of your enterprise The honour which you did me Sir during your stay in my dominions and the liberty with which you allowed me to tell you my sentiments induce me to entreat you now to remember that by the death of Queen Anne France is free of all engagements with England those which had been contracted by the most Christian King having been only with the Queen personally and not with the English nation This leaves France without any engagement and in a situation to support you without any reproach But Sir this support when too public may not be advantageous to you and in my opinion as I have had the honour of representing to you several times already the most essential succours are not to allow you to want money to secure your passage by some ships and to permit you to take along with you the national troops which would not alarm any one in England whereas French troops certainly would  Some arms and ammunition will be no less necessary ammunition may be easily found at Calais and for fear of losing time arms may be taken from the troops which work at the new harbour near Dunkirk for they may make some difficulties about the time which will be necessary for furnishing these things If the duke of Berwick as you believed was not desirous of attending you he has succeeded but Sir I entreat you to remember that a good officer who is not a stranger is necessary for you I have no doubts but you will land in Scotland it is upon that kingdom it appears to me you ought principally to depend You will probably find there a greater number of friends and besides it is a country in which you can better maintain your ground The disunion of  that kingdom is the measure which will attach them most to you Forgive me Sir this detail but amidst the great occupations in which you are engaged you may not perhaps recollect this of which however you yourself are convinced My zeal makes me take too much liberty which you will be pleased to excuse as well as any omission I may have been guilty of during your stay in this country I can do nothing now but pray God to bless your undertaking

particularly as to her brother for it could not well relate to any thing else when as the bishop took leave of her to go out of the room he said aloud in the presence of the duchess of Ormond and other company Madam I'll obey your commands I'll declare your mind but it will cost me my headThe Queen proposed to receive the sacrament next day but died first"  Ibid p  Anecdote from R Lesly  "HE

him his sentiments in relation to the conduct that the King ought to observe to carry his point The Abbeé said he might forget and desired lord Oxford to put them in writing he did so and gave the

if it was lord Oxford said he knew nothing of it that he did not meddle in affairs  and that he would be against it if proposed Soon after he met lord B and asking him about it and expressing his wonder that they should think of such a thing after it had been so carried in the house of lords B denied that he knew any thing of it Afterwards they were called into council where the Queen giving no body time to speak said she had resolved on a proclamation which she caused to be read and then without staying for or asking any body's advice went out so that it was all her own act Asking lord Bolingbroke afterwards how it came to be issued out in such a manner he said lord Trevor who was then necessary to him positively insisted on it that it should be done and he was forced to comply  May at supper at L S's L L was giving an account of the struggle between lord B and lord Oxford The latter was absolute at first and lady Masham hated L B who was only kept in because the peace was transacting and nobody else could speak French At last lord Oxford disobliging lady Masham in the affair of Quebec she joined L B and lord Oxford was turned out a little before the Queen died The design of L B at the time was to bring about the Hannover succession and two or three days before her death L L and Sir W Windham going in a coach together the first said Now they had got the power entirely into their hands they might easily bring about a restoration to which Sir W said Put that out of your head that will never beis an impracticable man  i e  he would not change his religion at

the Earl of Oxford's quarrel with the duke of OrmondThe Duke of Marlborough and Lord Bolingbroke were always friends  "L L on the th of June told me that Mr Harley at the time he was bringing about the change in the ministry in was near quarrelling with lord Harcourt and Bolingbroke He had a mind to fix them in their old posts of secretary of war and attorneygeneral But the one insisted on being lord chancellor and the other secretary of state which he refusing to agree to they came to L L and told him the case and that there was no doing any thing with him and therefore they determined to go the one into Oxfordshire and the other into Berkshire next morning and as he was to stay in town they begged of him to shew himself cool and reserved to him L L said he was sorry for the occasion of their going but he would not quarrel with an old friend without reason They said all that they desired of him was to shew himself cool to Mr Harley which he determined to do After they were gone lord L wrote a letter to Mr Harley acquainting him with Harcourt and Bolingbroke's being with him and their resolution and told him very plainly that if he went on at this rate he would lose all his friends and nobody would have any thing to do with him represented the consequences and desired him to consider them He left a copy of this letter in England Harley and Bolingbroke after parting with L L had gone to Mr Harley's and this letter was delivered to Mr Harley whilst they were with him and they saw the superscription to be lord L's hand Bolingbroke asked L L afterwards what was in the letter for he said he never saw a man so struck in his life time as Harley was after reading it The issue was Harcourt and Bolingbroke were satisfied and staid in town  Harley used often to complain to lord L of the Tories having been cut out of business for above twenty years and of their unfitness for it and had therefore a mind to bring over a capable Whig or two But the least motion of it put the Tories in a slame and he could not do it  Harcourt had complained often in very feeling terms to lord L that he knew no more of the measures of the court though he was L C than  his footman That lord Bolingbroke had not made him a visit of a year and lord Oxford did not so much as know him But just before the Queen died Bolingbroke brought him into his measures and they were entire confidents  Oxford and Bolingbroke had always been pushing one another from the very time of their power and labouring to supplant each other Lord Oxford told L L upon asking when he had seen Harry St John and L L answering that Harry was a man of business and he had not seen him of a long while that Bolingbroke was betraying all their counsels to lord Marlborough and that he owed the finding out of the secret to little Dartmouth and Erasmus Lewis had made the discovery  It is certain lord Marlborough was very fond always of Harry St John and on the loss of his son the lord Blandford said he had no comfort lest but in Harry St John whom he loved and considered as his son and notwithstanding the difference on account of Party the duke always had a regard for him  Bolingbroke in the midst of his struggle with lord Oxford was hated mortally by lady Masham and abominated by the Queen for his loose life and Oxford was in the height of his credit so that he must have fallen if he had not been necessary for the scheme of the peace he being the only man about court that could speak French or transact any thing with Mesnager or the other persons sent over by the court of France or to be sent into France  About the same time or a little after the first overtures of peace the Quebec expedition was set on foot in which lord Oxford refused to gratify Mrs Masham in an affair relating to it by which she would have got a good sum of money She though his relation resented this highly Bolingbroke improved the moment struck in with her and told her he would get it done in spite of lord Oxford He did so and she stood by him afterwards  Lord Oxford who was for serving the King  This seems to be a mistake  fancied Bolingbroke was engaged in that scheme and therefore thought to strike in with the H of H This completed his ruin and he was mistaken in his point for Bolingbroke's view was the H of H and the night after lord Oxford was out L L came to Kensington to get the Queen to sign some papers  which he deferred upon the dutchess of Ormond who was then in waiting her telling that the Queen was something indisposed but she would acquaint her if his lordship pleased But he said it was no matter of consequence and he would not disturb her He saw there waiting for lord Bolingbroke who failed them Charles Caesar John Drummond c John was to part in a day's time for Holland to engage lord Albemarle to negociate for them with the court of Hannover and these and others then in waiting as John Drummond himself told L L were all in that scheme The earl's death blew up this affair that ministry lasting only three days and the house of Hannover not sensible of their obligation to them  Lord Marlborough landing as it were the moment of the Queen's death I was apt to fancy he might be in that scheme but L L said he did not believe it and he heard lord Bolingbroke in company with himself lord Bath and others on the day of the duke's entry into London speak with a violent resentment upon it and say He ought to be sent to the Tower for it  December the th Mrs A O told me that lord Oxford opposed the duke of Ormond's list of new officers for the army because it was composed of Bagnals Mathews and other Irish and because the duke of Ormond insisted that the officers turned out should be paid for their regiments and posts which they had purchased with their blood which the new officers proposed were not able to do nor could the Exchequer then supply  l  which was the least it amounted to That upon lady Masham's quarrel with lord Oxford about her share in the per cent reserved out of the Assiento contract which was intended to be shared between her c She sent for A O to apply to the duke of Ormond who said she could not pretend to have so much credit with the duke though perhaps her mother might That her mother was sent for and she A O went to Sir John Stapleton's where the duke was to sup fetched him away to Kensington where lady Masham told him how ill the Queen was and how uneasy at nothing being done for her brother and that if he would but secure her  l  of the ten per cent which amounted to  l  she would join with him and he should have the modelling of the army c as he pleased He was afterwards introduced to the Queen who was ill this was the year before her death in order  to offer his service to serve her brother and have the modelling of the army c granted him but instead of giving any assurances or making any proposals to the Queen who was prepared to grant him every thing he only asked her if she had any commands for him and went away without saying more  The duke of Ormond took it ill of lord Oxford that when he desired  l  a year pension might be settled on lady Hales lord Oxford proposed to make the duke's own pension  l  instead of a year and offered to get it done and then the duke might give her as much on his own estate but lady Hales piqued herself on having a pension from the Queen and made the duke refuse the offer and quarrel with lord Oxford who would not grant the  l  a year pension  When lord Oxford was turned out Bolingbroke's scheme and Harcourt's was for the house of Hannover to make the duke of Marlborough general and if the duke of Ormond submitted to it to allow him the post of lordlieutenant of Ireland if not to turn him out of all and slight him"  HANNOVER PAPERS    THOUGH the Tories were generally deemed Jacobites by the house of Hannover there is no reason to believe that the whole of that party were friends to the Pretender The bigotry of that prince in adhering with such obstinacy to the Romish faith cooled the zeal of those who were most attached to the line of hereditary succession Besides many Tory leaders disappointed in their own views upon office and offended upon that account with the lord treasurer began to cabal with the Whigs Among these was the earl of Anglesea a man of quick parts but revengeful in his disposition This earl together with Sir William Dawes the successor of archbishop Sharpe in the see of York possessed great influence with the Tories On the th of April in the present year they joined themselves to the Whigs when upon a division in the house of lords the protestant succession was by a small majority voted out of danger They were followed by the whole bench of bishops by the earls of Abingdon and Jersey the lords Ashburnham and Carteret and some other temporal peers of the High Church party Their principles however were not the sole motives of this desertion The means by which Anglesea the archbishop and their friend Sir Thomas Hanmer were gained to the house of Hannover are explained upon more solid grounds in the following papers  Notwithstanding the votes in parliament the security of laws which had never been infringed and the manifest attachment of a great majority of the nation the family of Hannover misled by the ignorance of their agents and the violence of the Whigs continued to think that their succession to the throne was in the utmost danger The Elector himself harassed and fatigued by the eagerness of his agents and the vehement  remonstrances of those who called themselves his friends had become extremely indifferent about a throne so difficult to mount He had during the whole course of the preceding year declined to gratify the Whigs in sending over the Electoral Prince He refused to satisfy either their avarice or their wants with pensions He would not give them money to influence the general elections in their favour He rejected their violent proposal of invading the kingdom with an army Having failed to awaken the ambition of his Highness they applied themselves to his humanity and his fears They represented that their liberties their fortunes and perhaps their lives were in the utmost danger should the Pretender succeed to the throne They insinuated that neither the Elector himself nor his family could be safe upon that event in the heart of Germany that a prince who considered them as rivals in the succession would never sit down contented till he had reduced them so low as to cease to be an object of terror This last consideration had at length such an effect upon his Highness that he permitted his envoy in London to demand a writ of summons to the Electoral Prince as duke of Cambridge a transaction that made a great noise at the time and is fully explained in the following papers  The attention of the people having been gradually raised by this and similar circumstances the Queen and her servants found it absolutely necessary to concur at last in appearance with the sentiments of the nation They had hitherto succeeded notwithstanding the arts of the Whigs in establishing a general opinion that a perfect harmony subsisted between the courts of Great Britain and Hannover Whatever affection the Queen might have had for her brother a great part of it was obliterated by his bigotted attachment to a system of religion which she abhorred She however secretly wished that he might succeed her in the throne But her servants would be extremely willing to retain their power by gaining the good graces of the house of Hannover  "A foolish circumstance which rendered ineffectual all endeavours of the late ministry to establish themselves in the good graces of the court of Hannover as I shall particularly relate in another work It may suffice to hint at present that a delay in conveying a very inconsiderable sum to a very inconsiderable French  vagrant  Robitban  then at Hannover out of the service of some German prince it is not known how got into some credit with the Elector"  gave the opportunity to a more industrious party of corrupting that channel through which all the ideas of the dispositions and designs of the Queen the ministers and the whole British nation were conveyed"  Swift's Enquiry  and she herself  sent Mr Harley this year to Hannover to inquire what further securities the Elector thought necessary for the succession of his family to the throne She offered to concur in whatever he should demand excepting the sending over a prince of his family to reside in the kingdom This she thought was the same thing as to descend from the throne She and her ministers were much blamed by the Whigs for refusing to invite the Electoral prince That party had forgot that they themselves had been equally averse from such an invitation when they were in power  "For my own part I freely told my opinion to the ministers and did afterwards offer many reasons for it in a discourse intended for the public but stopped by the Queen's death That the young grandson whose name I cannot remember should be invited over to be educated in England by which I conceived the Queen might be secure from the influence of cabals and factions The zealots who affected to believe the succession in danger could have no pretences to complain and the nation might one day hope to be governed by a prince of English manners and language"  Swift's Enquiry  The lord treasurer while a commoner and speaker of the house voted for all the acts that were passed in different sessions of parliament for settling and securing the succession in the protestant line Notwithstanding what has been supposed by the court of Hannover and asserted with uniform vehemence by the Whigs no decisive proofs can be advanced that he ever favoured the Pretender during the four years of his administration In the two last years when he found himself declining in the Queen's favour and felt a consequent diminution of his influence in the cabinet he made all advances to the court of Hannover consistent with the aukwardness of his manner the reserve of his temper and that affectation of secrecy and design which he thought absolutely necessary for a minister and which he probably used to conceal his own want of extensive talents A discerning reader will perceive even through the complaints and prejudices of the Hannoverian agents that this unfortunate man wished sincerely to secure a retreat for himself behind the succession in the protestant line He paid no court to the Jacobites and high Tories  that was not absolutely necessary for continuing himself in office Bolingbroke was the principal adviser of all the violent measures which contributed to increase the terrors of the Whigs and to continue the suspicions of the house of Hannover  The apprehensions of those who were or pretended to be wellaffected to the succession in the house of Hannover were not entirely groundless The jealousy of the Electoral family could not altogether have proceeded from the inventions of faction the misrepresentations of party or the ignorance or blind zeal of their agents in London Though Queen Anne was perhaps conveniently free from strong attachments of any kind though she was actually too dilatory and unenterprising in her nature and timid in her disposition to engage in any dangerous undertaking though she was probably as averse from bringing over the Pretender during her life as she was from seeing a prince of the Electoral family residing in the kingdom yet it can be now no question but towards the end of her reign she was favourably disposed towards her brother and would have been well pleased without any trouble or danger to herself to have secured for him the eventual succession of the throne He himself was no stranger to this circumstance and he formed his expectations accordingly In a declaration published immediately upon her demise he says  "Of her good intentions towards us we could not for some time past well doubt and this was the reason we then sat still expecting the good effects thereof which were unfortunately prevented by her deplorable death"  The court of Hannover though the suspicions of their agents were greater than the truth could not possibly be strangers to the Queen's intentions Notwithstanding all the kind assurances and protestations of friendship received from Anne it was natural for them to suspect her sincerity when they saw that all the avowed friends of the Pretender supported all her measures The character and manner of her minister were calculated to increase the suspicions of the Electoral family With some abilities he possessed all the weaknesses and even stooped to the meannesses in which the whole art of every shallow politician consists Regardless of sincerity in his political conduct he often promised more than he had either power or inclination to perform Flying perpetually from the  point in his conversation upon business he disgusted mankind in general in proportion to the eagerness which men entertain concerning their own affairs It was only when he meant not to adhere to his word he gave any answer at all and that was even then contrived in a way that rendered it ambiguous There was an air of secrecy in all his manner and visible in every feature of his countenance and an affectation of mystery and deep design even in trifles This defect in his character was so little calculated to gain the confidence of others that it actually exposed himself to suspicions when in reality he might have no bad designs  The repeated charges brought against the earl of Oxford in the Hannover papers may be justified by the defects of his own manner and mind But his colleagues in office especially the viscount Bolingbroke were more sanguine in their temper and determined in their measures An inveteracy arising from mutual injuries had subsisted between them and the Whigs for several years It was foreseen that an universal change of men and measures would take place upon the demise of the Queen that the Electoral family would employ the Whigs in the administration of their affairs whenever they mould succeed to the crown that the Tories would be humbled and those at present in office be in danger of their lives and fortunes It was therefore natural to suppose that men in such circumstances had entered into secret measures to form a shelter for themselves against the storm which was gathering over their heads Their common prudence if not their principles might be supposed to direct their views to the Pretender But notwithstanding all these appearances there is reason to believe that had the Queen lived for some time longer even Bolingbroke would have found means to reconcile himself to the house of Hannover having held an uninterrupted communication with the duke of Maryborough who was much more attached to the recovery of his own power than to either of the rivals for the British throne  "THESE devils of  Grubstreet  rogues that write the  Flying Post  and  Medley  in one paper will not be quiet They are always mauling lord treasurer lord Bolingbroke and me We have the dog

Ridpath was assured by the colonel that the Cameronians of the South and of the West both of Mr Hepburn's and Mr M  c  Millan's party had declared openly against the Pretender and expressed great

moment in giving him notice of it  Having reasoned with lord Halifax on this event we imagine that from this measure we must suppose one of two things or perhaps both either that the Queen appears to the lord treasurer to be in such a bad state of health that he thinks he ought to make his court to his Electoral Highness or that things are not yet come to maturity here in favour of the Pretender and that France does not choose to assist him to mount the throne nor to give him the number of troops which his friends judge necessary But in either case he thinks that we can draw great advantage from it and even though lord Oxford should be as great a fool and as great a rogue on this occasion as he has always been such a measure as sending in this present conjuncture his cousin who is his great favourite may set him forever at variance with such of the Tories as are for the Pretender by which he will lose a great part of his credit  Lord Halifax told me that the petition of the

out matter for a plot to be charged on the Whigs for bringing in the house of Hannover by force during her Majesty's life which the spy himself discovered to one of my friends"  Ridpath in this long

interest enough among the Cameronians on his wife's account at the time of the Union to keep them from breaking up the parliament but he was well paid for it by the lord Godolphin and the D of Queensberry and by that money bribed others to concur with him but that being now known the Cameronians hate him and call him a traitor"  Ferguson it seems had married the eldest daughter of Ker of Kersland and the male heirs being extinct assumed tile name of the family  "He did get money from lord Godolphin on pretence of his interest with the Cameronians and that he was courted by France but upon the change he played the knave and endeavoured to blacken the late ministry as not having listened to his information of a Jacobite plot and that he could procure an address from Cameronians for

country before they had seen any of our friends they said the very same things to me which I wrote to you already I hope therefore you will maturely weigh an affair of so great importance on which depends your succession and the fortune and lives of those who have your interests at heart in this country and who are devoted to your service  Consider further that if ever the Pretender mounts the throne which he will undoubtedly do if he comes with a French army  i e  or men before any of the family is here in what manner England and France in conjunction will concur in your ruin and in the destruction of a family which they will know they disobliged so much by robbing it of a crown which was destined for it and of which they will not believe themselves to be in peaceable possession while that family remains on a good footing I leave it to you to consider what efforts they will make to ruin it in one way or other  You must be sufficiently convinced ever since the same thing has been so often repeated to you that the ministry of this country make great  efforts to weaken our party among the people by making them believe that the oaths which they take as well as the act of succession regard the Electoral family merely because they were the nearest protestant successors at the time when these acts were past and that as they were past merely to prevent the danger of seeing the crown of these kingdoms fall into the hands of a Roman Catholic the principal design was to have a protestant successor That therefore it was sufficient to answer that design and that to find a protestant successor who was nearer of kin than the Electoral family would be a thing which was just and to which every true Englishman ought to be naturally inclined  These reasonings have their weak side of which I wish the nation was as thoroughly persuaded as I am But the real state of this kingdom at present is that all honest men without distinction of party acknowledge that although of every ten men in the nation nine should be for us it is certain that of fifteen Tories there are fourteen who would not oppose the Pretender in case he came with a French army but instead of making any resistance to him would be the first to receive and acknowledge him  It is likewise very certain that if some prince of the Electoral family came now to this country all those who are at this time in office would hasten to make their court to him and things would be made quite safe and solidly settled in our favour  What answer shall I make to these facts which I know to be certain How can I encourage men whom you do not choose to acknowledge or support either by money or by sending over some one of the family Or in short what other measures can I take which will give them courage at a time when they know for certain that the next session of parliament will not end without enfringing the acts of succession And what remedy do you imagine you can then apply which may prevent or disconcert their design Is it Mr Harley's embassy and the manner in which the lord treasurer and he explain themselves to me Is it the proofs which they give you of their attachment at Utrecht In short what is it"  For my share Sir I entreat you to employ all these reasons to convince our master without being restrained by any apprehensions of hurting my fortune thereby I had rather lose it by saving men of honour who are in the interests of his Electoral Highness and by showing him the  true state in which his affairs are in this country than fail to inform him of his danger of losing both his succession and perhaps something else  These things must undoubtedly appear disagreeable to you Judge then how I must consider them and with what satisfaction I can hear them repeated to me so often by all those who are generally acknowledged to possess abilities and zeal and who have had the constancy till now of remaining attached to our interests although without a miraculous interposition in their favour as well as in ours they must believe themselves to be absolutely lost seeing themselves entirely abandoned by those in whose cause they run every kind of risk"  Hannover

money's being for the most part lodged here a good morsel for their stomachs  To secure this place therefore the magistrates who are generally well affected and who have the executive part of the law

suspected persons to prevent a surprise and so pary the first shock which probably may be the worst all which they radyly enugh agreed to and I hope will observe Care is taken to encourage them by

letter from Kreyenberg to Robethon in High Dutch  Hannover papers vol marked Schutz fils p and  and two in French from Schutz one in his own hand and the other in Galke's dated February  They acquaint him that some motion was to be made in parliament in favour of the Electoral family  "If one may form a judgment from several incidents which happened within a few days affairs take a turn here to our advantage Some persons declare openly for us from whom that was never expected We shall see if they continue to speak the same language when the parliament meets Among other circumstances it is considered as a very lucky one that orders are given to bring back three regiments of cavalry and two of dragoons which remained in Flanders till now although they were a part of the men which are granted for the defence of Great Britain"  London  Ibid p  February Schutz writes to Robethon that the parliament met that Sir Thomas Hanmer was chosen speaker that the seals were put to a warrant the preceding week for  l  to the Lord Treasurer as a reward for his good services and to enable him to purchase a house of the duke of Grafton's in the neighbourhood of St James's palace and that  l  were to be given to lord Peterborough for his services as general of marines  There is a copy in Robethon's hand  Hannover Papers vol marked Shutz fils p  of a long letter which Schutz wrote in cyphers of the same date  "Lord Nottingham came to me to desire me to offer his respects to the Elector and to intreat him not to take amiss the liberty which he takes of declaring to him his sentiments on the present state of affairs in this country as he thinks himself in conscience obliged to give him these proofs of his attachments to his service after having once devoted himself to it  "As he lays it down for a foundation that the Queen's ministers are against the succession and for the Pretender which he proves by their conduct these two years he thinks it is not by them we should expect to be maintained in our rights to the succession and as they are convinced themselves it would be too late after the Queen's death to attempt to set the Pretender on the throne they will exert themselves to secure it to him during her Majesty's life"  Nottingham thought they would do this by the assistance of France or in an attempt to alter the regency bill and expected the Elector would at last agree to the only remedy which all his friends judged would be effectual viz to send over the Electoral Prince  "Your friends will not fall without employing all their efforts to preserve you the crown and as they see that all their representations to you have been in vain that you do not deign to believe them and judge perhaps that it is their own interest which influences them to speak in this manner they will demand of the lord chancellor a writ for the Electora Prince to take his seat in the house of peers"  This would be considered as an invitation from the Queen and no one would venture to oppose t  "They ask from me" says Schutz "a positive answer to this directly They can only represent things to you and if after you neglect every thing they will at least have the satisfaction to have done whatever depends upon them and will endeavour to support the misfortunes which will happen to them only because you neglect your interests by refusing to follow the advice of those who think them inseparable from their own"  P S "The design of the ministry is to give a blow to the succession by altering the regency bill and naming among the lords justices after the Queen's death some who are devoted to the Pretender"  There is a copy in Schrader's hand of a letter from Schutz to Bothmar of this date  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  Both lord Oxford and secretary Bromley declared against the coming of the Electoral Prince as a thing that would be liable to a thousand inconveniencies  "Oxford has done every thing in his power to be reconciled with the duke of Argyle and entreated lord Orrery to be always his friend promising to him that he would keep himself very quiet in parliament and do prejudice to none but both the one and the other continued firm without giving him the smallest hopes"  Ibid p  Kreyenberg to Robethon  It was rumoured in town when Kreyenberg wrote this letter that the Ministry were to propose in Parliament an invitation to the Electoral PrinceHe gives Robethon his opinion of their designs particularly of Oxford's view in proposing to alter the act of regency  Translation from the High Dutch  London  February  "UPON the 'late change of the ministry there was a general rumour that the Queen was to send the earl of Rivers to Hannover to desire the Elector to send a prince of his family to reside in England which at that time the treasurer gave out as a thing determined upon and even told the lords Somers and Halifax as in great confidence that the Queen intended to offer the Elector the command of the army in Flanders and this was told in such a manner that these lords believed it But it was soon found that this story was only to amuse the nation and to re establish credit in some degree and that the treasurer might know the disposition of the house as in the infancy of his ministry he could not know how every individual would allow himself to be managed"  "The same rumour was spread two years ago at the meeting of the parliament upon which however I will not insist as it appears to have been rather a direct mockery than that the situation of affairs then required it But now things are come to a crisis a new parliament is chosen and the first session which is always a delicate matter has not the desired effect trade is interrupted France is victorious over the empire and behaves with haughtiness to her friends as well as enemies The lord treasurer by his haughtiness and breaches of promise is personally  hated by many people A considerable party begin to make an outcry about the succession and other things The bank and consequently the public credit is in a very bad situation the stocks fall the people are discontented and lastly the Queen is in so bad a state of health that nobody believes she can live long  In such circumstances it is not to be wondered that the treasurer falls to his old shifts and finding that the report of the duke of Kent's going to Hannover has little effect as every body is persuaded that were the court in earnest one would be sent of some interest in either party he now gives out that the Queen has given occasion to an invitation and that secretary Bromley was not only to propose it to the lower house but was in person to go to Hannover to deliver the Queen's message  What I have said above of the lord treasurer's conduct particularly with regard to lord Rivers's embassy must necessarily raise doubts as to his sincerity in thisand not to speak of the Queen's personal inclinations when one considers the lord treasurer's behaviour at the very time he makes such great promises I do not see the least regard can be had to them I must own that one here on the spot can judge of this better than can be shown by a letter I shall however add one or two remarks  First then I must observe in general that to make so great and sudden a change of measures is very difficult and requires near connexions with another set of people which hitherto has not happened neither is the first minister in such a situation that he can act so cavalierly with France and the Jacobites here who are not so contemptible a party as is generally believed without having made up with the other party as hath been said  dly The Jacobites are more and more encouraged and are daily placed in all the small posts of which no lists are kept and as to the great employments it is certain that lord Stairs and the duke of Argyle have lost theirs  dly The court is busy at this moment to get out by petitions or otherwise from the house of commons all those who have distinguished themselves for the succession and particularly an inquiry is made in a most scandalous and inquisitionlike manner against Mr Walpole who has made himself formidable and it is resolved to have him  per fas et nefas  voted out of the house  thly There is good reason to believe that the report of confirming the act of regency which has been spoken of is not without grounds nay that it appears to be really resolved upon and the success of this matter is the less doubted of at court that it appears very plausible to the Tories To whom they set forth that in the sealed act as it now stands most of the lords of the regency are Whigs and so they must fall into the hands of their enemies whereas if the next successor is fixed by a new instrument to be registered in Chancery decency will require that at least a certain number of Tories should be named with them Others say that the nomination will be lest to the Queen and parliament Be that as it will it is certain that if the act of regency undergo this change it is in fact annulled and so the strongest wall in favour of the succession thrown down How all these things agree with the present offers is easy to judge  I have endeavoured to flatter myself into a belief that the lord treasurer acts in this matter uprightly but can find no reasons to encourage me to such a belief When one considers that man's humour and way of acting they may think that perhaps the Jacobite party grows too strong for him and that supposing the Queen's health reestablished to keep that party in awe and perhaps to get something from France he will show them he is not in so bad a situation but that he can do without them and for some time continue his game without being obliged to declare for the one or the other party All this might be supposed of this minister if one did not reflect that the present step is of too much importance and that he had not reason to be afraid of the proposals being really brought to a bearing Those that think he has been obliged to this step against his will have a better opinion of the lower house than I have unless the state of the Queen's health is so bad that there is no appearance of her being able to come to London allow me to add that the advantages that the lord treasurer will draw or seeks to draw from the present proposals are these  st In general to amuse the people and to prevent the fall of credit  dly To prevent some Tories coming into measures with the Whigs and so hinder these last from making some disagreeable overtures in the beginning of the session and  dly To afford to these that pretend to be friends to the succession yet for private interest will not break with the treasurer an excuse for not meddling in any thing in favour of the succession so that the treasurer will by this means gain some weeks during which time he will be able to bring his forces into order and may then laugh at every one for the rest of the session and undertake with safety to change the act of regency  Lord Cowper having understood that there was a writ made out at the chancellor's office for the hereditary prince as duke of Cambridge to appear in parliament employed the clerk who gives out the writs to the peers to enquire at the lord chancellor whether he should bring the Electoral Prince's writ to the envoy of the Elector's court The chancellor received him in a very angry manner enquired who had employed him in that message reprimanded him severely and ordered that the writ should not be delivered out of the office even though enquired for The officers sent by Mr Stanhope to the Boulonnoise and Flanders are returned and report that they found no troops in motion there only that nine Irish battalions and a regiment of dragoons were advanced from Lorrain and in quarters at Douay Valenciennes and Hesdin and that the officers said openly that they had orders to be ready to march upon a minute's warning  After I had ended this letter I have learned from good authority that Mr Harley's instructions bear to let his Electoral Highness know that a faction of ill disposed people disturbed her Majesty's government by raising jealousies and alarms particularly with regard to the succession notwithstanding the act settling the succession was in full force that her Majesty would however do all she could with honour to make his Highness easy as to that matter but that if to chagrin her an invitation should be proposed to parliament she would look upon it as a personal affront I cannot be sure of the truth of this information but as I had it from good hands I thought it my duty to communicate it"  Original Hannover Papers vol marked Strafford and a French translation vol marked Bothmar x No  The Earl of

your Royal Highness of your most devoted humble  servant and to beg the continuation of the honour of your good graces and those of your commands if you have any in this country I thought Mr Harley would have been over by this time and then Monsieur Lahonton would have seen the effects your Royal Highness has over me since nothing is harder at our court to obtain than money though I must own in this case naming your name my lord treasurer was as ready as I was to obey any command of your Royal Highness's I could not have imagined till I was in England the heats and animosities there is amongst people even of the same principles and believe me Madam all the noise made about the Pretender is groundless and the Tories are full as much in your interest or rather more than the Whigs though the latter have of late got up a way of threatening the Tories with the protestant succession as if your Royal Highness or those of your illustrious house who should succeed the Queen were not to reign over the Tories as well as the Whigs I am satisfied that your Royal Highness knows Great Britain too well not to know who are honest men and who otherwise without the distinguishing names of Whig and Tory for I am sure you know what is called Tory are those which are for the church of England which is all or almost all the clergy of England a great majority in the parliament and nation and almost all the landed men in the kingdom who should be more desirous than they to secure their religion and liberty to their posterity and you may depend upon it Madam they are all heartily in your interest I need no better proofs than that famous book of Steel's called The Crisis which the Whigs cry up so much and which I think is demonstration to your Royal Highness that you have nothing to fear from the Tories Are they not all sworn to your succession Have they not all abjured the Pretender And is there one man either in parliament ministry or any place of trust that is not sworn to support your succession and to oppose the Pretender's Are not our laws made so strong that it is high treason to do any thing against your succession Can any one pretend to suppose that all the clergy all the men of the greatest estates in the kingdom would at once venture soul and body and fortune to be in the interest of one who puts their religion and liberties in danger Can any honest man pretend to say that all these people would voluntarily engage to be damned to be hanged and to lose at once all their estates and liberty from themselves  and posterity All I could wish is that means could be found out to quiet people's minds and that the protestant succession should not be more the cry of one party than the other that it should be as it is esteemed the good of both parties and of all the kingdom I flatter myself I have some place in your good opinion else I durst not take the liberty I do to assure you that I know all the present ministry is as much or more sincerely in your interest than the last were I had a very good opportunity to know it for when the Queen was lately so ill that people began to make reflection if she should have died and being to be by my post as first lord of the admiralty one of the seven regents or lords justices in case of a demise I saw so entire and so strong a resolution to adhere to the protestant succession that I shall never be more

being you have always used me with that goodness I may say kindness that I can't do too much to show my gratitude and real zeal for your interest The Queen by all our relations is so perfectly

Majesty's illness I am very glad to find by him the republick takes the alarm and begins to wake out of the lethargy it has fallen into since the peace at Utrick It is true indeed the Queen's health growing so bad as in all probability she can never recover it and the minister's making such open steps in favour of the Pretender  as to leave no doubt of their intentions to place him on the throne has brought things so near a decision that unless the states design to look on and see us lost and consequently themselves they could no longer remain inactive or delay entering into such vigorous measures as are absolutly necessary to save us both The first and great mark of their present good disposition is their secret resolution to set out as soon as possible a strong squadron of men of war for which they have found a very plausible pretext when their preparations are so far advanced as to oblige them to own it They have likewise in case of her Majesty's death agreed on the most proper means for assisting his Electoral Highnesse with their troops and doing every thing that depends on them for his service which I omit explaining since you have been particularly informed of it by Monsieur Bothmar I shall only add that they have promised to go on with their seapreparations though her Majesty shou'd continue to languish on for some weeks longer for it has been shewn them our danger would be greatest in that case for it would give the ministers time to concert every thing with France for bringing in the Pretender even whielst the Queen was alive therefore all measures to support the succession of his Electoral Highness would prove ineffectual unless a sleet was ready to obstruct the Pretender's passage and to convoy such troops as must be sent to join with the nation

with I must beg of you to make him my most humble and sincere acknowledgements for this new mark of favour and confidence I shall make the best use I can of it for his service in the advancing of which I am always ready to hazard both life and fortune I constantly transmit whatever I receive of consequence from England to Monsieur Bothmar that he may comunicat it to the pensioner at the  same

Robethon  Translation  London  March N S  "OUR friends having for a long time deliberated on the measures they should take for the ensuing parliament have at last agreed that their best conduct will be to meddle in nothing and to propose nothing in parliament The reason they commonly and openly allege is to show lord Anglesea Sir Thomas Hanmer and men of that character who have credit with the High Church party and pretend to be our friends that it is not from a spirit of faction they have acted till now and they can be quiet and do not desire forcibly to assume to themselves the glory of securing the succession but are ready to assign to them the Tories all the honour and all the merit of it and to promise to second them at the time and in the manner they themselves shall prescribe  Besides they saw as they told Kreyenberg that all their efforts would be ineffectual unless the Elector took some decisive step on his side and they were not sure but he attributed their conduct more to private than to public views They would wait until they heard what Mr  Harley did at Hannover and what answer was given him and they would regulate themselves accordingly This resolution made Kreyenberg very uneasy as he was afraid it proceeded from despair and from an apprehension that they were blamed and abandoned by the Elector  With regard to my lord Anglesea I can venture to say from my own knowledge of him that he is rather for the succession than for the Pretender but at the same time we may depend upon it that he will do nothing but in certain circumstances and that he will not break with the court unless the Elector or the Electoral Prince is here and that is the case of Sir Thomas Hanmer and of several others  Lord Notingham urged Anglesea very much to enter into measures for proposing an invitation but he always answered that it was not necessary and that it could not be done with propriety as the Electoral Prince in quality of peer could come over whenever he pleased and as all the Oxfords in the universe could not hinder him"  Original Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar x p    Schutz to Robethon  Schutz argues in this letter as Kreyenberg argued in the preceding  Translation  London  February March  "I Was informed a few days ago says he that the Queen's ministry triumph when they are together especially in their drunkenness at their having at last engaged her Majesty to order Mr Harley to make it clearly known to the Elector and Electress that the coming of any one of the Electoral Family into this country would displease her infinitely offering them in other respects all the security which they themselves would choose to ask for further establishing the succession in their family"  From thence Schutz draws several arguments for the coming of the Electoral Prince and then proceeds  "You have been already told that of ten who are for us nine will accommodate themselves to the times and embrace the interests of him who will be the first on the spot and who will undoubtedly have the best game and all the hopes of success rather than expose themselves by their opposition to a civil war which appears to them a real and an immediate evil whereas they flatter themselves that the government of  the Pretender whom they look upon as a weak prince will not be such a great evil as a civil war And we want to flatter ourselves when we imagine that those who call themselves our friends are such heroes as that the love of their religion and their attachment to us will animate them sufficiently to expose themselves willingly to the greatest dangers to maintain the rights of a family which is distant from them and which always shewed great indifference for the succession to the crown of these kingdoms"  In another letter of the same date  Hannover papers vol marked Bothm  r x p  he expresses great impatience to know what impressions his arguments have made at Hannover "Although I ought to be at perfect ease whatever turn affairs may take now as I did not neglect to give you all the necessary and suitable advices I own that I take the thing too much to heart and find my situation disagreeable to hear every day those whom you yourselves acknowledge to be your best friends complain that you abandon them and wantonly neglect our interests notwithstanding their intreaties and their clear representations to you of the danger to which you are exposed when at the same time I understand that in spite of all my importunities there is any hesitation to represent to our master what concerns him so much to know  After repeating the complaints of their friends and their resolution to do nothing in parliament as mentioned in former letters from himself and from Kreyenberg he writes for the first time about an affair which Kreyenberg had mentioned in a letter inserted above and which made a great noise thereafter  "Chancellor Harcourt to whom it was proposed to send to me the writ of the duke of Cambridge without his being able to suspect that the proposal came from me gave a very bad reception to the person who made the motion to him and strictly forbad his clerks to bring it to me or to give it to those who might call for it without an express order from him You may judge now the reasons of this prohibition and whether it proceeds from himself alone The writ is in his office in all the forms with the great seal and in a more authentic manner than the writ of other peers from whence one may judge that the princes of the blood usually had them  I imagine you easily conceive the embarrassment I must be in in regard to this writ A great many knowing that the chancellor has not sent it  to me are surprised I do not ask it Now how can I do so having no orders from you I own however that this alone would not hinder me if I could flatter myself that after I shall receive it and send it by express to Hannover which I would have done if I had got it the Electoral Prince will immediately set out for this country  Two things he said hindered him from asking the writ he was afraid that the chancellor would venture to refuse it and that the Electoral Prince though he got it would not come over"  Hannover papers vol marked Bothmar x p  Schutz to Bothmar  A copy in Schrader's hand  Translation  London  February March  "THE Queen since she has been in town called several peers into her closet and among others the duke of Kent to whom she said that she hoped he would always join her ministers in all the affairs that might be debated in parliament But upon his answering that he would be always willing to declare himself for every thing that would be of real service to her Majesty in parliament and for the good of his country in general she told him that she intended to send lord Oxford to him that they might converse together upon that matter He has been actually with him for two hours speaking as ambiguously as usual He wanted to prove he was a Whig because it was by his means that lord Cowper was made a peer but when it was proposed to bring over some one of the family of Lunenburg he said that would be to place her coffin before her Majesty's eyes and that those who had any respect and friendship for her could never propose a thing that was so disagreeable to her  Those who have seen lord Anglesea and are his friends acknowledge that he is a great deal more cool than he was before he went to Ireland and he declines hitherto to enter into what our friends propose to him One may judge by lord Orkney's discourses that he will go with the courtparty in every measure as well as lord Lexington whom the ministry found means to satisfy They say very openly that money and offices now adays have charms which it is impossible to resist All  this is a confirmation of what has been said already so often that there will be a universal corruption here unless great care is taken"  Schutz  Original Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar x p  in a letter to

happened in affairs here"  Ibid p    Kreyenberg to Robethen  Translation  London    March  "KREYENBERG having written four pages about the complaints of the Whigs of their being abandoned and their resolutions of doing  nothing in parliament and about lord Anglesea's conduct ambition c proceeds to give his opinion and advice in the following terms  "With regard to the Tories in general I am very far from calling them all Jacobites but the misfortune is that they suffer themselves to be led and it is certain they will never oppose the Pretender at the hazard of the smallest part of their fortune They don't mince the matter in their conversations although they allow that their religion and liberty would be more secure by holding to the present establishment yet they slatter themselves that by good laws both the one and the other may be very well secured They are not the lowest class of people who reason in this manner It is but four or five days ago that lord Guilford speaking to lord Cowper as intimate private friends about the rumours which are current concerning the Pretender told him sincerely he could swear he knows nothing yet of a formed design of bringing in the Pretender and does not believe there is any but I frankly acknowledge says he that if matters ever go any length the greatest part of us Tories will willingly submit while you Whigs will perhaps be fools enough to expose your country to a civil war and to be laid waste by the French on the one hand and by the Germans on the other"  Kreyenberg writes that many of the Whigs would act and that some of them argued already in the same manner and maintained that nothing could justify a civil war if they could possibly be safe without it They saw that if the Pretender was once come over it would be very easy to hinder Holland or Denmark from giving any assistance "and what is still worse" continues Kreyenberg "the Whigs do nothing new partly from the want of power and partly from their chagrin at seeing themselves neglected and abandoned and it will not be long before they will file off after the rest I do not  ean that they will all become Jacobites but one will retire to the country another leave the kingdom perhaps and so on with the rest  Till now the Whigs in general allowed themselves to be governed by Devonshire Sunderland Somers Halifax Townshend Cowper Oxford and lately by Nottingham likewise merely from the opinion they have that these noblemen act in perfect concert with the Elector and have great credit with his Electoral Highness but they begin to perceive that matters do not go on as they imagined and as men seldom find out  the true medium in things of this kind they carry their reasonings farther than is just The duke of Argyle since he has got a little into the secret of the Whigs appears to be greatly surprised and God knows if in the humour he is in now he will not join the first He dropt some words to me the other day which convince me that his blood boils and that he is a man who will consult only his own interest"  Schutz writes to Robethon  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  in a letter of the same date that lord Montrose came from Scotland on purpose to repeat to him what all the noblemen of that country in the interest of the family had repeated to him before about the necessity of sending over the Electoral Prince or doing something that would convince their friends they were not entirely abandoned  Ibid p  Schutz to Robethon  A copy in Robethon's hand of what Schutz wrote in cyphers  Translation  March  "LORD Halifax entreated me to inform you of what he is resolved to do He has charged those among the Whigs who have most intercourse with the Tories to tell them that for his share he would not speak about the succession any more in parliament That they the Tories being out of question the majority might do with regard to it whatever they pleased That he renounced for ever all the advantages which might result to him in case the succession should take place and that they might take all the merit of it to themselves  He made this declaration only because he saw no other means of opening people's eyes and he has some design of making it in parliament According to his opinion unless the Queen or the Pretender dies soon you may look upon the succession as lost The blame he says cannot fall upon him since it is certain that if you had followed even lately his advice and the advice of all your friends you would have prevented that article in the Queen's speech by which the ministry boast they have shut the door against any of the family who would choose to come here  Sir Thomas Hanmer whom I saw yesterday told me that he did not despair yet but it is certain that he was duped by lord Oxford and Mr Bromley in the affair of the address of the commons Besides lord  Anglesea will not oppose the ministry with whom some of his friends tell me he is reconciled In short they will not contribute to bring over any of the family although they allow it is the only means of putting the succession out of all danger and the motive of this shameful conduct is an apprehension that the Whigs may enter into employments and all the protections which the Whigs incessantly make to shew they renounce them appear to them incredible and not to be trusted"  Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar to No  Bothmar

will find you safely arrived I acquit myself of my promise to give you an account of the business of which you spoke to me here I shall begin with the proposal of the Electoral Prince's journey to England  The Elector having known long ago that the Queen was averse from seeing any of his family at her court hesitated always for that reason to send the Prince his son However he would have complied at length with the importunities of his friends in England if notice had not been given to him that Mr Harley was charged by the Queen to intimate to him that the sending the prince or any of the Electoral family would disoblige her highly and that she would oppose their coming It is likewise easy to perceive that her Majesty's speech to the parliament referred to that The Elector hopes therefore his friends will consider that these circumstances render this journey impracticable unless he has a mind to come to an open rupture with the Queen You and other friends may judge Sir if that would be seasonable if it would be for  the advantage or disadvantage of the succession and if affairs at home and abroad are in a situation to justify such an extremity  Since it appears then to be impracticable to bring into the kingdom the successor whom the laws destine to the throne it will be the more necessary to secure the protestant succession by removing the competitor The Elector made instances for that purpose to the Queen by the late baron de Grote who gave a memorial on the subject to the lord treasurer he will continue to do so when Mr Harley arrives he will give it to him in writing and baron de Schutz will have orders to speak in the same style at your court  His Electoral Highness is of opinion likewise that the regencybill should not be changed from a pretence of amending it He will shew Mr Harley likewise that he is satisfied with it and that he wishes it may be preserved entire which baron de Schutz had orders already to tell to the lord treasurer and to the rest of the Queen's ministers If there is any thing else to be done for the greater security and further establishment of the Protestant Succession his Electoral Highness resigns himself to the opinions of his friends who are the most competent judges for deciding concerning the utility or necessity as well as practicability of measures for that purpose  The Queen's speech gives room to think that the court intends to make things which concern the Protestant Succession the subject of deliberation It is to be wished that the result may contribute to its firmer establishment and to be hoped that there is no intention of making a law to forbid the Protestant Successor to come into the kingdom during the life of the Queen It would be injurious to him to be put thereby in some measure on the same footing with the Pretender  As to the rest Sir you will inform our friends of the good disposition of this State in favour of the Protestant Succession and of what they were prepared to do in case the Queen had died and of what the Elector himself was resolved to do The Queen's recovery does not make them lose sight of these things The Emperor's peace changes a little the state of affairs but he will continue in arms for three months yet at least it being impossible to conclude the peace finally before that time Endeavours will be used in the mean time to bring about an agreement between the Emperor and the States about the barrier in order that his Imperial Majesty may have a good number of troops in the Low  Countries He always assures the Elector that he has the affair of the Succession much at heart  Yet he listened two months before to a proposal made by the Pretender to marry an archdutchess He even in some measure recommended his own sister to that prince

Rastadt agrees entirely with our sentiments here and the pains your court is taking towards bringing the Emperor and the States to an amicable accommodation in relation to the Netherlands together with the hopes you give us of success in that grand affair is a great encouragement to all that wish well to the house of Hannover There is one passage in yours where you seem to think it is impossible for the Pretender to make  any attempt during the Queen's life In this we are absolutely of another opinion for reasons as we think so very obvious to those who observe with the least attention the present conduct here that there is no need of entering into particulars on this head and this being the settled notion of all your friends here you will easily imagine into how great a degree of despair we were all thrown by that part of your letter where you mention the Elector's resolution of not sending the Electoral Prince without a previous invitation For it is but a small comfort to us to see how diligent and careful you are in taking remote precautions abroad whilst we are convinced that the danger is so imminent here that we shall in all probability be totally ruined before any of those supports can possibly come to our relief But now I must congratulate with you upon Mons le baron de Schutz's last orders for demanding the Electoral Prince's writ of summons This I can assure you is thought by every body both friends as well as enemies to be the first step that your court has made that looks as if you were in earnest about the succession Nothing can be more effectual if it be supported by the immediate sending the Prince nor more seasonable than it was at this time for the Queen had just then given a most unkind answer to give it no worse term to an address for the support of the succession and when the house of lords came to consider of this answer the effect of the Electoral Prince's having demanded his writ appeared most plainly by the behaviour of a great number of lords upon that occasion though that news was not then publickly known Mons Schutz will acquaint you with the consternation our ministers were under upon this occasion and the fright the chancellor was in lest it should be thought he had denied the writ They are so sensible that this step if it be followed by the immediate coming of the prince will so effectually ruin their designs and tend so directly to the securing the succession from all future danger that you may depend upon their making use of all arts and contrivances imaginable to prevent his coming Neither threats nor flattery will be spared They are so intent and so bent upon prevailing with you to stop the prince that they will not rely upon Mr Harley's dexterity but have determined to send to you my lord Pagett You must therefore prepare to be very vigorously attacked by way of message they see the spirit of the people here runs so high in your favour that they have no hopes of bringing either them or parliament up to any thing that may discourage the prince's  coming They are therefore forced to turn all their views towards you and are reduced to the miserable necessity of trying whether they can persuade your court to betray itself I shall trouble you no farther than only to give you the unanimous opinion of all our friends upon this occasion They are persuaded that you must be convinced by the manner in which this writ was granted that you have opened a most unexceptionable way for the coming of the prince It is plain the writ would not have been granted could they by law have justified the refusing of it and the uneasiness they expressed both when it was granted and since shews plainly they would not have failed to have attempted something in parliament in order to have discouraged him from coming could they have had the least hopes of carrying it From this we cannot think but that you must be satisfied that the inclinations of the people here are so strongly in favour of the house of Hannover that the prince may come not only with great security as to his person but also that he will be received with all the respect and honour that is due to him But if after you have raised these expectations through the whole kingdom to the highest degree by the step you have made you shou'd be prevail'd upon to abandon the thoughts of sending the prince or be persuaded even to delay it such a proceeding will be so fatal that no man can be answerable for the consequences of it I cannot conclude this without doing justice to Mons le baron Schutz who has upon this and all other occasions behaved himself with so much zeal and prudence that he has deservedly got the entire esteem and consideration of all both Whigs and Tories who are well affected to the house of Hannover"  Extracts of letters from Schutz to Robetbon  He has had an interview with OxfordThe Queen is highly displeased at his having demanded the writHe is forbid to appear at court  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  Schutz to Robethon  Translation  London  April  "THEY have held frequent councils here and continue to shew great dissatisfaction the lord treasurer having told me yesterday that he never saw the Queen in a greater passion All the reason he alleges to me for this is that she had no notice from me of the demand which I was to make of the writ and although he could not deny but the chancellor  prepared and delivered writs From whence I wanted to prove to him that it was therefore to the chancellor I was to address myself as he was the minister to whose department such things belonged besides that my orders imported to go to him and that he did not discover to me that I addressed myself improperly yet he said that I ought to have addressed myself to the secretary of state or to him who would not have failed to advise very properly in the affair protesting that he had no service more at heart after the Queen's than that of the Electoral family and that he was vexed at what had happened the Queen taking it as the greatest mark of contempt that could be given to her telling me that had it not been for this incident her Majesty would have invited the Electoral Prince to come to pay her a visit next summer without recollecting that he had told me but a moment before that she was too much afraid to see any of the Electoral family here and that this alone excepted she would willingly grant every thing else that could be demanded of her  He heaped together several very unintelligible things in this discourse to which I made no other answer than that having addressed myself to the proper officer for a thing which the law determined in our favour I could not imagine that the Queen was angry at it nor that she would interpret wrongly a measure of that kind"  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p    The same to the same  A copy of what Schutz wrote in cyphers  Translation  London  April  "I Cannot but repeat what I wrote to you already by the advice of all those who have our interest at heart about the coming of the Electoral prince c  The advice which was given to me by lord Oxford and confirmed by Mr Bromley not to appear any more at Court seems too violent especially as the ministers say nothing to me but that I should have addressed myself to Mr Bromley instead of demanding the writ of lord Harcourt and without proving this by any example or argument they say simply that the Queen takes it as a mark of contempt although it would have been contrary to the custom of this country as well as to the order of the Electress to have applied the other way  I acquainted our friends with every thing that happened to me in the course of this affair I placed the same confidence in lord Anglesea and Sir Thomas Hanmer and they blame the conduct of the ministry being now fully convinced that the protestant succession is in very bad hands  Lord Anglesea who is very well acquainted with lord Paget gives me a bad character of him saying he is false and changeable He believes with several others that his lordship will not go to Hannover as the coming of the Electoral Prince must be determined before he can be ready to go"  April  Hannover Papers vol marked Schutz fils p  "Sir Charles Cotterell master of the ceremonies came and read to me a letter from Mr Bromley secretary of state in which he intimates that the Queen commanded him to tell me not to appear any more at court as she looks upon it as an affront I have done her to have asked the chancellor for the writ to the duke of Cambridge a prince of her blood and that for that reason she had ordered Mr Harley to solicit the Elector and Electress to recall me instantly Upon which I said to him that in consequence of the respect I owed to and had for her Majesty I would not fail to obey her orders"  An original Hannover Papers vol marked Strafford  Extracts of a letter from Lord Strafford to Sophia Electress of Hannover  He answers her lettersAdvises her and the Elector to disapprove of Baron Scbutz's conduct and vindicates the ministry from having any designs in favour of the Pretender  Hague  May th  "THE reason why Mons Dalay makes difficulty to go to the foreign churches which other ministers before him never did is since the passing the bill of occasional uniformity about three years ago which only affects those that are in employments of trust or profit so that my lord Morpeth having none did not lye under those difficulties Mr Dalay does I make a doubt whether that act extends out of her Majesty's dominions but as it is a doubt I would no more risque it than I find Dalay will and had it not been for Mr Cadogan I had not minded it But asking him just after the act passed to go with me to the French church to hear a famous preacher here he told me he did  not know what I might do  but for him he was not so fond of going to any church as to venture the loss of his employments which he had not then quitted so I having a chaplain of my own have never thought it worth venturing to go to a foreign church but have constantly the common prayers in my family and sermons every holiday"  "I am assured his lord Paget errand is to explain matters and set them in so true a light before you that no artifice of a faction or party for private views and interest may be able for the future to cause any inquietude between the Queen and your illustrious family I took the liberty at my last coming hither to state that matter plainly to your Royal Highness who was so good as to make me the answer I could wish both in relation to your respect for the Queen and your being of neither party and yet I am sorry to find your minister in England has lately acted as if at least he was governed by the party that is against the court because the chief amongst them have not the chief employments at court and I am afraid his late behaviour is something resented as being very irregular and neglectful of that respect due to the Queen for though by strictness of law I believe a peer may demand his writ of the lord chancellor though absent yet it is never done but the lord chancellor keeps it by him till such time as the absent peer returns and demands it himself to sit in parliament I know this better than any man it having been my case under several lord chancellors as I have been abroad ever since the first year her Majesty came to the crown and having often had leave to take turns into England the chancellors have always kept my writ till I came and demanded it to sit in parliament which they immediately were obliged to send me and so it would have been with the duke of Cambridge whenever he should come into England to sit in parliament Upon his demanding it the chancellor is obliged by law to send it him immediately This being so what occasion had Mons Schutz to go just at this juncture and to demand it of the lord chancellor without having previously acquainted some of the Queen's ministers of state or having first notified his intentions or orders if he had them to do it to the Queen by the secretary of state for her Majesty's approbation which he might have been assured would not have been denied him no more than she did her leave to lord chancellor to deliver the writ when he asked her if he should do it I must own to your Royal Highness I  am very sorry to see such things happen Let the partys jar as they please but let not any thing happen by any minister of yours that may be interpreted as if your illustrious family wanted all the confidence and consideration imaginable for the Queen who I find by Mr Secretary's letter is herself a little startled at this way of proceeding of Mons Schutz and if you will pardon the liberty I take I believe nothing could have a better effect than your and the Elector's disapproving what Mons Schutz has done in this matter As I certainly wish well to the protestant succession in your family and desire heartily the peace and tranquillity of my country I can't but apprehend for both if some effectual means is not immediately found out to put matters upon such a foot as to convince the world that there is a mutual good understanding between the Queen and your Royal Highness's illustrious family and that you act on both sides with the just consideration and confidence you ought to have for and in one another Your Royal Highness knows my character and opinion of partys You know my zeal for your interest and therefore I hope will excuse this liberty I take to beg of you to consider seriously with the Elector your son upon some expedient to put matters upon a foot of reciprocal confidence in the Queen and your illustrious house A King or Queen of England must govern by the bulk of their people and must never be tyed to one or t'other party which made King William and all the Kings his predecessors change from one to the other party as they had the majority of the nation and parliament and any King or Queen who would reign with a party against the majority of the nation would have but a most uneasy life and God forbid I should live to see ever the Queen and her successors struggling to support different parties"  "After all the foolish and malicious outcry of the danger of the Pretender I have asked the people here to tell me one thing done in his favour or one thing left undone to exclude him and to secure your succession nay I have desired them to let me know what was desired or if there could be any thing more done to secure the protestant succession in your illustrious house and if they would tell me I would engage it should be done And upon discoursing this matter t'other day with the pensionary he seemed convinced of the truth of what I told him and that there was no just grounds for this outcry about the Pretender and  that nothing could be of a worse consequence than the project talked of by some Whigs of getting the Electoral Prince over and setting him up for successor in prejudice to your's and the Elector's right The pensionary told me upon this that he would go and talk roundly to that man pointing to baron Bothmar who was then in the Treveschamber when I was in this discourse with the pensionary and that he would afterwards tell me if there was any thing the Baron could propose to be done He told me after having talked to Bothmar that all he had to oppose was that the Pretender was suffered to continue in Lorrain Your Royal Highness is judge whether the Queen can oblige the duke of Lorrain to send him from thence if he won't and has engaged to France not to do it and what we can say more to France when they answer us that they have punctually executed their treaty by sending him out of France and yet that article in our treaty was looked upon as a hardship on the French King since even in the preliminaries in they did not oblige the French King so strongly as we had done in our treaty being all was said in those preliminaries was that

from good authority that the lord treasurer said some days ago to one of his creatures that he never thought that affair should have been pushed so far and another person affirmed to me that he said that he apprehended he would be very soon disgraced that they wanted to oblige him to enter into the measures of those who intended to establish the Pretender and that the Queen was more determined on that point than ever  I have received the pacquet for the baron de Schutz but the letters which came by a secret address are not yet decyphered I shall inform  lord Halifax of every thing I hope Mr Kreyenberg will make the compliments of thanks with which the Electress charged the baron de Schutz for lord Anglesea lord Abington and the archbishop of York It will be the more necessary to make them to the archbishop because it is well known he is not yet quite firm in the good cause and it is for this reason some friends desired me to write to you that a letter from the Electress would

pretend to have the principal share in his good graces This we will not envy them providing they attach themselves to him as they appear resolved to do and it is not to be doubted but as soon as he appears the lord treasurer will seek his protection and both parties pay their court to him There is no question therefore of sending the prince to be the head of a party but to have the glory of uniting the two parties who will concur together in parliament to settle a revenue of or  l  sterling upon him but for this purpose he must come before the end of the session  You see the Prince may

affliction for the death of my daughter  It is so evident that the Queen's ministers are determined to place the Pretender on the throne that it would be losing one's time to produce  proofs of it Their greatest desire and their only view in Mr Harley's embassy is to obtain some declaration from the Elector which may impose upon the nation and make it believe that your court is satisfied with them If you have fallen into this snare it will render all the efforts of your friends of no avail but we rely upon the great prudence of his Electoral Highness  A more proper time for demanding the writ for the Electoral Prince could not have been chosen for you see how many of the richest and most considerable among the Tories declare for you and acknowledge that they were deceived by the ministry who lose so much ground in both houses that you may depend upon it they will take care not to call the second session of this parliament before they have executed their design in favour of the Pretender for otherwise they will run a risk of being prosecuted for having betrayed their country and violated the laws and as they cannot justify themselves in that respect it is not to be believed that they will expose themselves to the hazard of another session for if they lose any more ground however small their ruin is certain  Luckily this session is to continue for two months longer as no supplies are yet found so that the Electoral Prince will have time enough before the end of it to arrive and take his seat in parliament in which case the balance will incline entirely to your side as it begins to do already upon the mere rumour of his coming so that you may judge what effect his presence would produce Accordingly our friends write to me that in that case the parliament will not rise before they have settled a pension of  l  Sterling for a subsistence to the prince who will have nothing to do but to make his court to the Queen and caress the ministers without meddling in any thing  By this remedy the succession will be secured without risk without expence and without war and likewise it is very probable that France seeing herself prevented in that manner will abandon her design of assisting the Pretender  In my humble opinion it would be proper to use dispatch and that the prince should set out before lord Paget arrives This journey of the Prince attended with the success which there is reason to expect from it cannot fail to give the Elector new influence and much greater consequence over all Europe as he will secure to himself thereby the crown  of Great Britain which will attach the Emperor Holland and the court of Prussia to him and render him the arbiter of the differences of the North Whereas if this opportunity is lost which according to appearances will be the last the contrary will happen and the influence of his Electoral Highness at other courts will suffer considerably by it especially after the great noise which this demand of the writ for the Electoral Prince makes every where which leaves no one room to doubt of his setting out soon so that if he does not set out at all your friends in England who have exposed themselves so generously for your interests will be absolutely ruined and the succession in the utmost danger which cannot fail to be productive of bad consequences to your court in all the other courts of Europe  It is easy for your court to conceive of what importance it is that the Prince should arrive while the parliament is sitting as the reason to justify his journey is the right he has to take his seat in parliament and the writ by which the Queen calls him to it I hope you will send me good news  I believe Mr Molineux will be now at your court I recommend him to you as being

be done for the greater security of the Protestant Succession established in their family and also the obliging assurances he added to it that her Britannic Majesty would have a pleasure in granting whatever they desired in that respect  It is in reliance on this that their Electoral Highnesses take the liberty of representing to her Majesty the necessity of obliging the Pretender to remove to Italy and the danger which may result from his staying longer in Lorrain both to her Majesty's kingdoms and to her royal person and the protestant succession  It is impossible to be more obliged to her Majesty than their Electoral Highnesses are for the instances which she has been already pleased to make for the Pretender's removal And as the present parliament as well as the former have shewn they are persuaded that the security of  the nation and of the succession is connected with it which is likewise the opinion of their Electoral Highnesses they entreat her Majesty to take most effectual measures for attaining such a salutary end and the more so the Pretender's adherents publish with the utmost assurance that he is preparing to make a descent in the North of Great Britain while the kingdom is unfurnished with a fleet and troops which is confirmed by different advices received from persons who have been lately at Barleduc and have a share of the Pretender's confidence and who affirm that he will begin very soon to execute his enterprise and that he depends upon a powerful foreign assistance  "Affairs being in such a dangerous situation their Electoral Highnesses hope that her Majesty will own with them that it is necessary for the security of her royal person and for that of her kingdoms and of the protestant religion to settle in Great Britain some one of the Electoral family who would be attentive to such important concerns and shew her Majesty by a fidelity and an inviolable attachment to her person how much their Electoral Highnesses are filled with respect and gratitude towards her The time appears to be now come when the security of their common interests cannot be found any longer but in a reciprocal confidence and in measures taken with perfect concert and when their Electoral Highnesses as they do not expect the security of their rights to the succession but from the continuance of her Majesty's goodness are ready to contribute on their side as much as is in their power to defeat the designs of those who would choose to disturb the tranquillity and felicity of her glorious reign  "Their Electoral Highnesses likewise take the liberty of renewing the instances they made near two years ago to her Majesty and to her ministers for asking that such a pension and establishment should be settled by act of parliament on her Highness the Electress as the nearest heir to the crown usually enjoyed Their Electoral Highnesses did not choose to form any pretensions in this respect while the nation was burdened with the expences of the war but these expences being discontinued and as every thing ought to be put upon a sure and solid footing by the peace they hope that during this very session of parliament her Majesty will be so good as to procure them a thing Which is so just and which is but a natural consequence of all that she has done already in their favour  "Their Electoral Highnesses hope likewise that her Majesty will be pleased to grant titles belonging to the princes of the blood of Great Britain to such of the Protestant Princes of the Electoral family as are not yet invested with them"

when she was princess"  Kreyenberg was convinced that the Queen and ministry would agree to every thing that could be asked of them if the prince did not come over and would perhaps sacrifice Bolingbroke and turn others out of the ministry but he thought that would be done merely to amuse the Elector until the parliament rose  "The Queen sent for the archbishop of York and made him the greatest protestations founded on conscience and sentiments of religion that she was sincerely for the protestant succession This prelate cannot reconcile all this with what he himself and every one sees She said nothing at all of the coming of the Electoral Prince but only of the disobliging manner in which the writ was demanded"  "It is confidently said now and it appears very probable that lord Oxford has carried his point with the Queen and is become prime minister It is believed that the affair of the writ contributed not a little to this as his lordship insinuated with great address

of the Electoral Prince would remedy every thing that even the ministers at least some of them would pay court to him and that there was no other remedy for saving the nation and the succession but that it must be applied without delay and before the end of the parliament"  "They give out at court that it is not the affair of the writ but the manner of asking it which displeased the Queen and for that reason they affect to shew a thousand civilities to Kreyenberg who has been two following times invited to dine with the Ld Tr who is more than ever in credit with the Queen and appears

Barleduc and brought to Scotland a great number of commissions from the Pretender My lord Brodalbin a declared Jacobite sets out for Scotland tomorrow"  Ibid p  Mr Cadogan to Bothmar  A translation in Schrader's hand  Reasons for sending over the Electoral Prince  Translation  SIR  London  May  "IF I did myself the honour of writing to you so seldom since I have been here it was to save you the repetition of the same news which you received from the baron de Schutz and Mons Kreyenberg but now when every thing is at stake and when our safety and the security of the succession depend entirely upon the journey of the Electoral Prince I consider it is my duty to represent to you in the strongest manner I am able that if his Highness's journey is put off the succession is inevitably lost  "One may say that the whole nation expects the prince now with the utmost impatience and that there is such a general disposition to receive him well that the ministers will be obliged to treat his Highness with the respect which is due to him But if the opportunity is lost this inclination may cool they will think themselves neglected and will be capable perhaps of going from one extreme into another  "Undoubtedly the reasons for the prince's journey become every day more strong you know them Sir better than any man therefore I shall only say that all the Tories excepting such as are entirely devoted to the ministers wish for the Prince's arrival with as much earnestness as the Whigs and there is reason to fear that if the resolution of sending him is changed our new allies lord Anglesea the archbishop of York and the speaker of the house of commons with their friends will leave us soon for they declare publickly enough that the succession cannot be secured but by the presence of the prince and they insinuated that if he does not come they will be obliged to take other measures  "You would see by the Gazettes that the stocks rose very high since the Prince's journey was spoke of an undoubted sign of the good disposition of the nation and I think I may assure you that his presence here will give us immediately a majority in both houses The Tories do not conceal their sentiments in this respect and they say publickly that they only wait to see the Prince for declaring against the ministers  "The lord treasurer and lord Bolingbroke are more exasperated than ever against one another The lord treasurer found means of reconciling himself with lady Masham and boasts that he will very soon turn out lord Bolingbroke and the lord chancellor and the treasurer's friends begin by private rumours to charge these two noblemen with the design of bringing in the Pretender In a word this is a fine opportunity for bringing over the Prince and the ministers being come to an open rupture with one another the parliament and the people are impatient to see him arrive and the partisans of the Pretender cannot disguise their apprehensions of this journey which they consider as a mortal blow to all their designs"  A copy in Schrader's hand vol marked Bothmar x No  Baron de Wassenaer Duvenvoerde to the Earl of Oxford  Translation  My Lord  May

so and I have had the pleasure to understand that the assurances of your good intentions and of your attachment to the interests of the illustrious family gave great joy at that court and that they desire to live in perfect confidence with you  With regard to the Electoral Prince's journey I am charged to tell you my lord that when the Queen gave the prince the patent of duke of Cambridge and regulated the rank of the Protestant princes of the family as princes of the blood by the act of precedency which was carried to them two years ago by Mr Harley that court imagined these were real favours of which they might make use when the opportunity offered and that the Electoral Prince when he made use of his writ of summons only made use of what was his right and that if he went to England it would be with an intention to continue inviolably attached to the Queen and to her ministers and to your lordship in particular wherein her Britannic Majesty would find her own safety and that of her kingdoms against the attempts of the Pretender who would not dare in that case to think of an invasion Besides that the King of France would have this reason to allege for dispensing himself from assisting him that there would be no means of doing it as the family of Hannover was beforehand with him so that nothing appears more conformed to the interest of the Queen and the nation than the sending over the prince which is evident as the Jacobites fear it as a mortal blow to their hopes  I hope my lord that you will have no difficulty of conceiving the Elector's views and I pray God with all my heart that the measures taken to secure the Protestant Succession to the crown of Great Britain may succeed persuaded as I am that the preservation of our holy religion and the safety of Europe depend upon it Your lordship is in a situation which enables you to procure so great a benefit by uniting still more clearly the Queen with the family of Hannover In the name of  God my lord employ your influence and your prudence to promote this falutary end You will gain the blessing of heaven and the applause of all honest men  If you think that I can be serviceable to you in any thing you will do me a favour and a pleasure by employing me I shall always shew that I have nothing more at heart than the establishment of the Protestant Succession and the union of the two nations and on

entirely his friends and encourage his enemies  I can assure you it is the general opinion of people of the first consequence and the well affected to the succession who are the majority of the kingdom that nothing can contribute more to render the Queen's reign happy and safe and at the same time secure the succession as it is established by the laws in favour of the family of Hannover than the presence of the duke of Cambridge among us that being the surest means to curb the great and continued efforts of those who act for the Pretender and give themselves out to be a very powerful party with a view of gaining over many to their faction at home and of encouraging France to send them the Pretender with French troops Upon that assistance their greatest expectations are founded You may judge then at Hannover of what importance it is to prevent such an event by sending over the prince I expect from you with the utmost impatience the good news of his departure"  Hannover Papers

Pretender's faction acknowledge that if the prince comes over their system's overturned and they invent lyes of every kind to destroy all hopes of the prince's coming producing letters from Hannover which bear that Monsieur de Schutz has been disavowed and very ill received and that it is certain the Elector will not send the prince to England  Mr Bromley secretary of state in particular spoke in this manner which has thrown the Pretender's faction into transports of joy and the friends of Hannover both Whigs and Tories into the utmost despair I have heard several of them and among others the duke of Argyle exclaim if the Elector abandons us in this manner and refuses to embrace an opportunity so favourable so easy and so conformed to our laws sacrificing us and abandoning us to the rage of our enemies after all that we have done for him we have no further recourse but to go to the other extremity and invite the Pretender to come over on tolerable terms and without a French army  I entreat your Excellency to communicate this to his Electoral Highness Consider what advantage the Pretender's friends will draw from it and if your friends being refused and disgusted it will not be very easy for your enemies to carry any bill they please in parliament for infringing the acts of the succession which they have attempted before now several times but without success The boldness of these people goes so far that Sir John Packington in a club of more than Tories proposed that the parliament should order the black box to be opened so they call the sealed instruments of the Electress appointing a regency in case of the Queen's death but the affair was dropped  This and some things still worse will be brought now again upon the carpet if the prince does not come for then your enemies will reassume courage and seeing that your court shews no resentment of the affront done to your Minister they will imagine as you put up with every thing that every thing is allowable to them  The pardon which the Queen granted to Doctor Bedford author of the bock on Hereditary Right is the greatest affront which her Majesty could offer to the Electoral family I don't know if these things are understood at your court or if attention is paid to them  They continue to dismiss all the officers civil and military who presume to shew any attachment to the Hannoverian succession and yet they give out that the Queen's ministers assure your court that they have the greatest zeal and attachment to them It would be very curious if they could succeed to persuade you of this  My conclusion from all this is that if the prince does not come over the succession is lost The delaying his journey has had already the bad effects I apprehended from it having given time to the ministers to contrive new intrigues and give life and courage to their party which was half extinct and which laughs now at your friends every where and asks them Where is then your duke of Cambridge And where is your succession Is it not more than a month since the Writ was demanded A proper resolution on the part of his Electoral Highness would make them change their language soon  Hannover

repeating to you that every thing is irreparably lost if the resolution of sending him is changed or delayed for the earnest desire of seeing him here having become so universal and augmenting every day his coming is so absolutely necessary that I fear a longer delay may produce very disagreeable effects  As to the Queen she continues much indisposed the St Anthony's fire  l'erisipele  which broke out in her leg and thigh has considerably deminished the violence of her fever but it is believed on the other hand that a mortification may follow She sleeps little and eats nothing and she is in such dreadful anxiety that her mind suffers no less than her body  The quarrels between the treasurer and Bolingbroke are greater than ever It is true their common friends reconcile them for a day or two but they quarrel more violently afterwards The partisans of both the one and the other give out that their leader possesses all the favour and confidence of the Queen but it is impossible to write any thing positively on this subject this scene at court having lately changed as frequently as the wind The fact is that these two ministers exert themselves very openly to ruin one another and as this division among the leaders reigns also among their followers it is very certain that if the Electoral Prince comes over both of them will be very soon overturned to which I may add that at bottom the treasurer would not be sorry that the Electoral Prince were here although he is obliged to declare and to publish the contrary for fear of losing entirely the Queen who cannot hear the prince's journey spoke of without putting herself in a passion and the more so that she perceives the nation desires it with ardour  What I write to you of the real sentiments of the treasurer concerning this affair comes from his brother the auditor who told it to general Erle from whom I had it The treasurer has likewise commanded several secret negociations with the Whigs since his credit has begun to decline at court and they have answered that in case he will consent to the coming of the Electoral Prince and exert himself seriously to secure the succession they will not only forget the past but they will endeavour to support him and to maintain him in his authority and in his office  I imagine Sir that it is impossible to act in a more disinterested manner than the Whigs do and I am almost persuaded that the presence of the Electoral Prince will determine the treasurer to adopt that plan  I shall expect with great impatience to hear from you and you may write by the

and penetration of your Electoral Highness can ever contribute to such an attempt and that I believe you are too just to allow that any infringement shall be made on my sovereignty which you would not choose should be made on your own I am firmly persuaded that you would not suffer the smallest diminution of your authority I am no less delicate in that respect and I am determined to oppose a project so contrary to my royal authority however fatal the consequences may be  Your Electoral Highness is too just to refuse to bear me witness that I gave on all occasions proofs of my desire that your family should succeed to my crowns which I always recommend to my people as the most solid support of their religion and their laws I employ all my attentions that nothing should efface those impressions from the hearts of my subjects but it is not possible to derogate from the dignity and prerogatives of the prince who wears the crown without making a dangerous breach on the rights of the

BolingbrokeThe Duke of Marlborough is expected in England Conjectures on the motives of his journeySuspicions of his corresponding with the PretenderThe Queen's sickness and death  Bothmar to Robethon  London  June July  HE had paid several visits and found none of the ministers at home but the lord treasurer and Mr Bromley"I am just returned from an audience of the Queen She answered me with a very gracious manner I find her paler than formerly but in other respects she looks well and seems to be in health excepting that she cannot walk nor stand up  I was told here that it is not lord Middleton himself but his son who went to Vienna and it must be certainly for a different purpose from travelling as he conceals himself there in a convent"  JulyBromley spoke to Bothmar of the publication of the Queen's letters to the Electress and to the Electoral Prince  Ibid No  It was suspected by some that Bothmar published them but he convinced them that he did not Those who were for the Prince's coming over were angry at the publication of the letters as it might produce bad effects among the people who would see by it that the Queen had so much aversion from a prince of the succession The ministry continued to be on bad terms  July  Ibid  "It is true the treasurer receives me very well but the question is if he is sincere and if he will still have power to serve us He deceived the Whigs and perhaps himself It is thought he has patched up matters with Bolingbroke I shall write to you about this by a secret address"  The letter which Bothmar promised to send by a secret address was written in cyphers the copy of it which follows is in Robethon's hand  "It was believed that the examination of the treaty of commerce with Spain would have given an opportunity of making Bolingbroke fall  Ibid  if  the treasurer with his friends had joined those who wanted to overturn his antagonist He had promised it by his brother through whom assurances had been given him that on that condition they would support him against Bolingbroke But it seems they dared not attack the latter directly seeing themselves uncertain of the treasurer and of his friends while Bolingbroke endeavoured to gain lord Anglesea Lord Abington and some others to his side At last they contented themselves with attacking only his friend Arthur More so that lord Bolingbroke will maintain himself in his post and may be able to turn out the treasurer by his credit with the Queen The fall of the treasurer appears to be very near according to the opinion of his own friends Some of those who would have assisted him to bring down his rival say now according to the maxim which prevails much here that he does not deserve to be assisted as he does not choose to assist himself  The reasons of his conduct in this situation of affairs are perhaps His own humour which does not allow him to keep himself entirely to one side The hopes of maintaining himself still in the Queen's good graces by the same means by which he introduced himself into her favour The hopes of entering again into favour by degrees although he should now lose his employment providing he does not declare openly against the court party That he is engaged so deeply in certain projects with lord Bolingbroke that he dares not attack him openly for fear of being involved in his ruin probably all these reasons contribute to influence his conduct  He seems however to reckon upon the good graces of the Elector and to be inclined to pay attention to them which Bolingbroke thinks incompatible with the service of the Queen from which one might conclude what are his intentions although they were not otherwise known We may be sure he will proceed rapidly if the direction of affairs falls into his hands It is said now that he wants to continue secretary of state but that Bromley will be turned out and Sir William Wyndham put in his place That the treasury will be put in commission That lord Anglesea will be the first commissioner of it and have alone the vicetreasurership of Ireland which he shared till now with lord Rochester and that Shrewsbury will continue lord lieutenant of Ireland from whence they would infer that he will abandon the treasurer to  unite himself with Bolingbroke although others do not believe this on account of the irreconcileable difference in their tempers"  July The letter in Bothmar's hand of this date contains nothing material  Hannover papers vol marked Bothmar x No  but the copy in Robethon's hand of what Bothmar wrote to him in cyphers contains the following particulars about the quarrel of the ministry  "It is thought that a reconciliation is made by the mediation of their friends but that Bolingbroke has always most credit with the Queen They say that not only the favourite but the dutchess of Shrewsbury is secretly for him by the persuasions of her daughter who is married to Sir William Wyndham  These two ministers have been for a long time on bad terms from the opposition of their tempers and manners But what gave occasion to complete their diffidence of one another and their disunion is a project which had been formed of dividing in shares the profits which the Queen was to have from the trade to the Southsea of which five were designed for the treasurer five for Bolingbroke four for lady Masham and two for Arthur More The treasurer having had his reasons for refusing the share destined for him was suspected on that account and at last became odious to the other sharers He afterwards furnished their enemies with means of discovering this mystery which gave them occasion to examine the treaty of commerce without producing the effect which they promised themselves from it as the treasurer did not furnish them with the assistance they expected from him and as the prorogation of the parliament put an end too soon to the deliberations on that affair  The Queen's answer to the address of the lords at which they are so much offended is ascribed to Bolingbroke Lord Anglesea is particularly offended having been the author of the address to which the Queen gave that answer and if her Majesty had not interrupted the debates by her presence matters according to all appearances would have been pushed very far in the animosity of all the house of peers against Bolingbroke and against her Majesty's answer His lordship they affirm will be prosecuted vigorously in the next session but as he apprehends this himself it is feared he will bring over the Pretender before that time to  save himself and to finish his grand scheme from which he expects the completion of the fortune which his ambition promises him  They ascribe to him likewise the Queen's speech others believe it was composed by the chancellor Harcourt It displeases people here in many passages they are persuaded that the last article reflects on the Protestant Succession and on the intention of having one of our princes in this country"  July Bothmar having mentioned the quarrels of the ministry adds  Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar No  "It is surprising that the duke of Marlborough comes over at such a crisis and does not rather wait until it is seen which of the two competitors will carry it with the Queen lord Sunderland himself does not comprehend this I am told he will be the day after tomorrow at Ostend in order to embark there for this country Cadogan has been for eight or ten days in the country He is expected back this evening He said when he went away that the duke of Marlborough would wait for him at Antwerp The impetuosity of the dutchess has probably precipitated this journey"  There is a copy in Robethon's hand of what Bothmar wrote by this post in cyphers He says the reconciliation of the ministry could not be durable Their quarrels continued and he found it very difficult to speak with them His friends dissuaded him from pressing them to an alliance with the Emperor and the King of Prussia for quaranteeing the succession lest they should afterwards think that the parliament demanded it of the Queen at the instigation of the Elector His friends likewise advised him not to ask at this time English titles for the prince of the Electoral family as that might be delayed without any inconveniency until the next session of parliament  "Lord Halifax" continues Bothmar "thinks that the Elector should have the title of prince of Wales and that very little time is necessary to prepare the way for that They are surprised that the duke of Marlborough is in a hurry to come here at this juncture If he adheres to his old friends he will run a risk with the ministry and if he wants to please the latter he will be abandoned by the former without gaining much upon the court It is thought that the treasurer has led him into this step by the means of Cadogan and that at length he will find himself shifted off as his old friends were to whom the treasurer had promised  likewise by Cadogan  August  to second them in the affair of the Spanish commerce of which promise he acquitted himself in the manner I wrote to you by former posts"  Hannover Papers vol marked Bothmar x No  July "I see by what you tell me of the King of Sweden that his return from Turkey will not be so soon It seems to me that his minister here flatters himself with a real assistance from this court I don't see however that things are yet disposed for that It is said he has hopes from Bolingbroke and wishes the Pretender were here already"  July August"We are still in expectations here of a change in the ministry  Ibid No  There are some who believe that if the duke of Ormond resigns his employments the duke of Marlborough will have the command of the army but I think there are many reasons for believing that neither the one nor the other will happen I imagine your Ker of Kersland will embarrass you Send him away speedily with a medal  Serve well the best  "  July August"The duke of Marlborough is not arrived yet  Ibid No  It is probable he wants to remain beyond the sea until he knows that there is a change in the ministry It is certain that the treasurer will resign his employment I imagine I can write to you this very evening that he has actually done so It was said today that Mr Boyle was to be first commissioner of the treasury and Mr Bridges one of his colleagues but that neither of them would accept"  July August"I am very curious to know if there is any foundation for what I write in my postscript to his Electoral Highness  Ibid  of a good understanding between the duke of Marlborough and the Pretender His Highness himself can give a great deal of light in this affair as I am assured that the lord treasurer showed him by his cousin the originals of the letters between the duke and the Pretender This correspondence appears to me to be altogether incredible it being inconsistent with all I ever saw or heard of the duke I refer myself to what I wrote about it to his Electoral Highness and to Mr de Bernsdorf entreating you to inform me in what manner they consider this affair I don't recollect it was to you or to his Electoral Highness himself that I gave an account of the communication of a letter by an unknown person to the duke of  Marlborough of which I speak in the same postscript perhaps that the person who wrote to him that letter has also forged an answer to it That letter consists in great reasoning on the weak state of the Protestant Succession and on the advantages which the duke might find in embracing the part of the Pretender without running any risk  I imagine they begin to reason much in the same manner at Vienna believing that our party is much weaker here than it is in reality and that we will weaken it by our indifference and that on that account they ought not to offend our competitor by too much opposition to him who can the more easily mount the throne here that we are indifferent about it I write that it would be proper to undeceive the court of Vienna of this mistaken opinion"  "P S This instant at half an hour after nine the duke of Grafton coming from Kensington tells me that all the physicians can do to make the Queen throw up two vomits of antimony produces no effect either up or down and that they believe she will not live out the night I have so much company in the house that I find it difficult to write to you"  In another letter to Robethon of this date  Hannover Papers vol marked Miscell d'Etat No No  he acquaints him that there was a change in the ministry that Oxford and Buckingham had resigned and that the Queen was dangerously ill  July August"I write to you but these two lines  Ibid vol marked Bothmar No  You will know every thing by my dispatches to his Electoral Highness and by Mr Craggs who brings them to you The Queen is at the last extremity and according to all appearances another express will soon follow with the news of her death and of the

morning and that our master was proclaimed without any difficulty I wish we may have him soon here"  Communicated to the Editor  Mr Secretary Bromley to the Earl of Clarendon  My Lord  Whitehall  July

instrument for settling the friendship upon a firm and lasting foundation The way to obtain it can never be by such a conduct as her Majesty has at this time too much cause to complain of and which I am directed particularly to mention to your lordship  There has been printed here as your lordship will see by the inclosed the letters her Majesty writ on the th of May last to the late Electoress Dowager and to the Electoral Prince The copies can only have been obtained from Hannover and therefore it is her Majesty's pleasure that you take notice of it to the Elector and let him know that she

the Elector and at the same time to let him know that this domestic incident shall make no alteration with respect to public affairs The Treasury will be put into commission  When your audiences are

appearance and would go on according to their most  ardent wishes providing the king came over soon His presence would prevent any disturbances even in Scotland where they were apprehended He sent the King a letter from the duke of Shrewsbury who wanted to be chamberlain and would resign his place in the Treasury and the lord lieutenancy of Ireland which Bothmar proposed first should be given to the duke of Ormond when the duke of Marlborough got the command of the army But he thought afterwards it would be better to place the duke of Ormond at the head of the prince of Wales's household as being fitter for a court than for any other employment and to make Sunderland lord lieutenant and Stanhope commander in chief in Ireland Ormond could not subsist without his pension Sunderland shewed always and continued to shew more attachment to the King than any other  August th  Hannover Papers vol marked Miscel d'Etat No  O S Bothmar in a letter to Baron Bernsdorff of this date mentions Mr

and Cadogan and then to think of doing something for lord Somers  Kreyenberg wrote to Robethon  Ibid No  in a letter of this date that the King had been proclaimed very quietly over all England and that they expected to hear he had been proclaimed in the same manner in Scotland and in Ireland that it was thought the Jacobites would not stir unless they were assisted by France and that the French

in England The  King has been proclaimed very quietly at Edinburgh and probably will be so likewise in Ireland where some propose to send general Stanhope while others think he will be made more useful in the English parliament He recommends to deprive lord North and Gray of the government of Portsmouth and to give it to general Erle and to make this change before the King's arrival He hopes the house of commons will grant the King for life the same civil list they gave the Queen and that the ensuing parliament will augment it on account of the Prince's family He forwards a letter to the King from lord Manchester who had been ambassador in France and at Venice and secretary of state at home and now begs only to be made a gentleman of the King's bedchamber a favour which Bothmar recommends to grant to him but he proposes that no answer should be given to his lady who wants to be one of the Princess's maids of honour He recommends brigadiers Honnywood and Dormer to be made grooms of the bedchamber the last having been recommended by the duke of Marlborough He thinks it will be sufficient now to give general promises to such as ask favours and to fulfil them when the King has formed his plan "He may then turn out in general all the late Queen's court and council"  He writes to Robethon  Hannover Papers vol marked Miscell d'Etat No  of the same date that a great change had happened by the King's accession to the throne of these kingdoms and that things go on very favourably for his Majesty It is reported that they are arming and preparing transports in France

Wharton and several other noblemen proposed to him to recommend colonel Tirel to the King for one of the grooms of his Majesty's bedchamber Bishop Burnet recommends his own son but Bothmar thinks it would be better to give him some employment in the law Mr Santyan wants to be a commissioner of the customs in England and Ridpath desires to be made one in Scotland  The Prince cannot take the title of Prince of Wales until the King creates him The duke of Bolton recommends his brotherinlaw Mr Crofts to be a groom of the bedchamber Lord Winchester's eldest son asked the same favour for himself He

is not only hated but likewise despised by his countrymen as a vain man who has not the smallest pretensions to be so"  The duke of Buckingham requested that his dutchess might be made a maid of

advantage to him in gaining the opinions and affections of the nation It will show his disinterestedness his generosity his rectitude and regularity in every thing The very proposal of charging that

expence out of his Electoral revenues they would ascribe it entirely to the refusal he met with here As you yourself answer the arguments drawn from the customs of the court of France I have nothing further to say to you about them You will easily conceive  that you would not be welcome to the English with the offer of a French example for their imitation I flatter myself you will find my reasonings so solid that this proposal shall never be mentioned again"  Hannover papers vol marked Miscell d'Etat No  Bothmar to Robethon  August  BOthmar delivered to the regency the King's message about Bolingbroke he wishes his place may be given to lord Townshend though Sunderland asks it "Lord Bolingbroke makes up Mr Prior's dispatch which may very well happen to be the last He said formerly

influence with his Majesty Bolingbroke was turned out in order to create a belief that he will have still the giving away of employments He hates lord Nottingham and to prevent his being president of the council he advises the duke of Devonshire to apply for that place in order thereby to keep lord Powlet in his office of master of the household and what is still more entertaining he says that unless this plan is adopted he will be obliged to make Powlet president of the council  The British envoys and residents at foreign courts wrote several letters to Robethon during the course of this

who meet his Majesty be out of mourning that day as also their coaches but all servants except those of the city magistrates to be in mourning The shortness of the time which would not be sufficient for the making of new liveries occasioned this last order The removal of the lord Bolingbroke has put a seasonable check to an interest that was making in many places for members in the next

kingdom before the Restoration in the year There are many letters correspondences memorials and anecdotes concerning the reign of George the First still in the Editor's hands These he designed to have printed but he finds that this volume has already swelled to a size that precludes him at present from executing his purpose They shall however be soon given to the public In this Appendix the order of time is not observed as in the preceding collection The papers omitted are marked as the volumes presented themselves to the Editor's hands  Bundle of loose papers  Life of James II Written by himself  KING James the Second was born on the fourteenth of October about twelve at night He went out of London with his father the Queen and the princess Mary to Dover He was sent back to St James's prince Charles only going to York About Easter the marquis of Hertford was ordered to bring the duke to him The marquis had received an order from the parliament not to carry the duke of York out of town yet he did He went with the Palsgrave and other lords and gentlemen to Hull the King intending to follow the next day Sir L Dyves came the next day before dinner and told the governor that the King would dine with him They were on a platform by the waterside The governor turned pale He desired the duke and company to retire to their lodgings The gates were shut and the garrison put in arms The King came and seeing the gates shut asked to speak with the governor who excused himself from letting him enter as trusted by the parliament The King gave reasons in vain The governor had received advertisement from York from William Murray  He was afterwards created earl of Dysert  one of the King's bedchamber as a friend advising him not to let in the King who was resolved if master of the town to secure him and cut off his head Nothing was more false yet it had effect on Hotham  The King then desired that his son and the rest might come out to him They were accordingly sent out one after another He then went back to Beverly  and York In Hull there was a magazine of arms and amunition for above twenty thousand men and a train suitable The King could not arm a hundred men Had he not sent Sir L Dyves before he might perhaps have been admitted and would then be master of the town which was affectionate to him and the gentry attending were too numerous for Hotham to resist The soldiers of the garrison all threw down their arms being called upon by some of the King's train without to do so nor did they take them up again till their officers with their swords in hand forced them Some vigorous bold men that went with the duke of York should have been trusted with the design with an order on the rest to obey the duke For it was in their power several times after Hotham ordered the gates to be shut to have secured him or knocked him on the head Either would have done the work Hotham came into the duke's room without any officer with him where he had before confined the duke yet none seized the opportunity Sir L Dyves and William Murray groom of the duke of York's bedchamber were the only ones for such a step and were resolved to kill him But they were confined before they could do it and a guard put upon them yet they were let out with the rest  The King wanted money and arms The Queen sent captain J Strahan with arms and amunition and officers in the Providence from Holland else the King could not have formed an army Captain Strahan brought them into the Humber where least expected so run aground at a place appointed He went from Brill to the Humber The signal was not answered He was forced to anchor when the tide was spent The parliament ship of fiftyfour guns came down from Hull and anchored with another from Grimsby near him They ordered him aboard But commanding one of the King's Ships he refused He waited till afloat and then stood towards Hull till near highwater He passed over a sand then but twelve feet water and when past it ran aground The parliament's ships drawing more water were not able to follow The Providence drew but eleven feet and a half water He got into the other channel by bearing up with all his sails The parliament's ships trying to follow stuck fast Strahan landed at Powle some miles below Hull on the same side of the Humber and ran his ships ashore so that it served for a battery to defend itself whilst the arms were landed and the seamen and officers were intrenched so that Hull garrison durst not attack them A convoy was sent from York The King would not let the ship be burnt after the guns were taken out and carried to York The seamen were made gunners  Essex's men were posted in the vale near Keynton  Oct  The King marched down the hill to fight them Ruthen who had served as major general under the King of Sweden and the earl of Brentsord being ordered to draw up the army Lindsay  took it ill and said he would serve as colonel and put himself at the head of his regiment of foot posted against Essex The King's army was above four thousand horse and eight thousand foot The rebels were three thousand stronger in foot but had not many more horse and few cannon It was three  p m  before the King's army were embattled when they marched slowly but with great resolution receiving the rebels shot till they came to push of the pike Both sides retiring as if by mutual consent back a few paces struck down their colours and stood firm till both drew off when it began to grow dark The enemy's left wing fled as soon as charged They were pursued without falling on the foot The enemy's foot made the King's retire to their cannon which playing with success stopt them Prince Rupert could not stop his horse from pursuing or make them charge the foot Lord Willoughby's gallant behaviour over his father's  The earl of Lindsey who died soon after of his wounds at Warwick He was an officer of experience He served with great reputation under Maurice and Henry princes of Orange  body who lay with his thigh broke by a musketshot and carried him to bs dressed But he was taken by some straggling horse who came in the way Sir Edmund Verney was killed and his standard taken But it was recovered by the means of Sir James Smith Both armies retired to their former posts and the King sent early next morning five hundred horse which brought off his own cannon and six of the enemy's Sir Faithful Fortescue had given notice of his intention some days before There were not full one thousand on both sides slain as the parson who buried and counted them said Lord Aubigny and lieutenantcolonel Monro were among the number The earl of Lindsey died of his wounds at Warwick About sixty standards were taken from the rebels The King marched to Edgert and Banbury taking the castle and so to Oxford But it was of fatal consequence that he did not march to London which in the fright would not have coil him a stroke  Ruthen the day after the battle desired the King to send him with most of the horse and three thousand foot to London where he would get before Essex seize Westminster drive away the rebel part of the parliament and maintain it till the King came up with the rest of the army But this was opposed by the advice of many of the council They were afraid that the King should return by conquest and said so openly They persuaded the King to advance so slowly to London that Essex got there before him and the parliament ready before to fly took heart All the King's old foot were lost in the siege of Gloucester and battle of Newbury  The duke of York might have escaped from Oxford  April  if Sir George Ratcliff his governor would have suffered it without a positive order from the King He was carried to London where the duke of Gloucester and the princess Elizabeth had been left when the King went to the North The earl of Northumberland was made his governor All respect was used to him George Howard brother to the earl of Suffolk and colonel Joseph Bampfield  His real name was Bamford an Irishman  contrived his escape the first carrying all the messages between the duke and Bampfield which was all he had to do  All things being prepared the duke of York supped at the usual hour about seven with his brother and sister and after supper all played at hide and seek with the rest of the young people of the house having played at it constantly every night for above a fortnight before The duke used to hide himself in a place where they could not find him for half an hour or more and then he would come out to them To prevent suspicion of his being gone when he really was the duke lockt up a little dog that used to follow him into his sister's chamber to prevent his coming after him slipt down the back stairs went into the innermost garden and so into the Park out of a back door of the said garden of which he had a key where Bampfield staid for him having a footman with a cloak which the duke put on with a peruke he had ready and went through SpringGardens where one Mr Trip staid with a hackneycoach which carried them to Salisburyhouse Here the duke and Bampfield went out of the coach as if going in there and Trip went with the coach into the city and kept it as long as he could at the end of the town But as soon as the coach was gone they took boat and landed on the same side of the river close to the bridge and went to one Loo's a surgeon where they found Mrs Murray who had women's cloaths ready for him to put on He was drest presently and went with Bampfield to Lionkey where there stayed a fouroared barge for them They went in it down the river the tyde serving them  But they no sooner entered the barge than the master suspected something Bampfield having told him to be there with his barge and he should bring a friend with him not saying it should be a woman He thought something more was in it and was so frightened that as they went down he did nothing but talked with them how impossible it was for them to pass by the Blockhouse at Gravesend without being discovered and that they had no other way to get on board the ship that staid for them at the Hope but to land at Gravesend and get a pair of oars to carry them down When they debated the distance and shewed him the hazard of getting a boat to carry them to the ship he objected the light of the moon He was soon satisfied fully that his woman was some disguised body of great quality For peeping through a cranny of the door of the barge where they then had a candle burning he saw the duke put his leg upon the table and  pluck up his stockings in so indecent a manner as made him conclude what he had before suspected This confounded him so as he told them afterwards that he hardly knew what he did or said which they perceiving thought it best to tell him the truth and trust him knowing him to be an honest man So the duke told him who he was and assured him that he would take care to provide for him and if it was not safe to return to London to carry him to Holland The man's mind was now settled He resolved to pass by the Blockhouse without going ashore and when they came near the town he put out the light let the barge drive down with the tyde passed undiscovered by the Blockhouse and got to the ship a Dutch pink of seventy tons lying for them at the upper end of the Hope She had been cleared at Gravesend where Sir Nicholas Armourer colonel Mayard Richard Johnson three gentlemen with each a servant expected them whom Bampfield had trusted and sent before that by their help he might master the vessel if need  They set sail at break of day with a fair wind and anchored early next morning before Flushing where they staid expecting the tyde to carry them up to Middleburg The master with two of his four hands went ashore with the boat to Flushing intending to be back by the time the water was high enough to go to Middleburg But before he came back Owen master of the barge who came along with the duke came down in a great fright to the small cabbin telling them that a parliament frigate was coming in to look for them and would be with them presently and that they must get their anchor on board and sail for Middleburg He was positive it was a frigate The two seamen would not get up anchor till the master came back But they were forced by the gentlemen and servants to do it though they said there was not water for it and the ship would be lost The ship proved only a merchantman The vessel struck twice or thrice But the master coming on board and the tyde serving they got to Middleburg before the tyde was spent The duke landed in women's cloaths staid all night went next morning to Dordrecht and sent Bampfield next day to the Hague to acquaint his sister and the prince of Orange of his arrival and to desire cloaths He was missed in an hour's time at St James's When he was not sound on search notice was given to Whitehall and general Fairfax  Rising in KentRainsborough commanded a squadron

ConstantWarwick These on notice of the three castles being surprized and seized by the insurgents declared for the King Rainsborough seeing that they of Deal had been instrumental in it went on board a ketch to go nearer to the shore the better to see what was doing there and thence sent orders to his ship to get under fail and stand as near as they could to the  shore in order to batter the town Accordingly they worked to get their anchors on board and in doing which in the ConstantReformation Rainsborough's ship and heaving out the capstern one of the boatswain's mates Robert Lindale thought it the proper time to execute the resolution which he had taken some time before of doing something to serve the King Having opened himself to three more common seamen whom he had found to be of his principles he proposed as all Kent had declared for the King to get some of the ships to do so They now as heaving the capstern began to grumble at the orders received saying they had no reason to batter Deal which was full of their wives children and relations to destroy it and them This working on the men they ventured further to say that it would be better to join with them for the King On crying one and all for the King Lindale told them he believed that the lieutenant and some other officers of the ship would be against it and they must immediately possess the gunroom and arm themselves and then they might seize their officers and those that would not join them They did so secured their officers telling them they would declare for the King and as they would not comply they put them in the hold till they let them go ashore and such as had a mind to go with them The officers were forced to submit This done he got under fail and passing along the broadside of the next ship told them what they had done and bid them seize their officers in like manner else they would sink them and thus from ship to ship till every one had declared for the King  Rainsborough seeing his ship had got under sail and yet not come up to him as he ordered but speaking to one another went to them with his ketch and asked his own ship what they were doing They told him he must not put his foot in it they having declared for the King but would send him his servants and some of his officers They did so and on his beginning to talk with them to return to obedience bid him hold his tongue or they would fire on him So he went away in his ketch up the river to acquaint the parliament The other ships turned out all their commanders then came ashore to tell the Kent gentry what they had done and to desire some that were seamen to come on board and command them as Sir William Palmer captain Bargrave captain Foy and others did and put in other officers Before they got out of the Downs the earl of Warwick came down in a ketch from the parliament to get them to return to their duty and desired to come on board of them They sent to know first what his business was He offered pardon redress of grievances if they would declare for the parliament Their answer was they valued not the promises of parliament that they had declared for the King and would be loyal The earl shewed a letter by which he had been invited down by some All these were sent to him He desired one of the ships for his better accommodation to carry him up the river promising on his honour to send it back They let him have the Nicodemus a sixth rate but he did not keep his word  They then went to Holland where the duke of York was to receive the prince's commands and arrived at Helveotsluys The duke went and staid on board with them till the prince came by sea from France He took the command and failed for the Downs leaving the duke in Holland and having first discharged Bampfield an unquiet intriguing head from his brother's service His tampering with the seamen and driving on a presbyterian interest so offended the duke that he would never take him again into his service whatever application was made Yet he supplied him with what he was able in his condition till the Restoration  The prince about the end of summer came with the fleet to Helveotsluys The earl of Warwick with the parliamentfleet followed to the same port The Dutch would suffer no hostilities and Warwick returned Prince Rupert who was made commander of the King's ships went with prince Maurice to Ireland Portugal the Streights and the West Indies where prince Maurice and some ships were lost Prince Rupert returned to Europe in and landed at Nantz The duke of York went to Paris a few days before his father's murder The King came thither in his way to Ireland where nothing considerable remained in the rebels hands but Dublin But he staid all the summer at St Germains or in Jersey till the end of September where he landed on the twentysixth of September and received an account of the rout near Rathmines All thoughts of Ireland were laid aside and the two ships sent by the prince of Orange to transport him were sent back to Holland Addresses were made there from Scotland by one Windram an honest gentleman The King resolved to return to Holland to treat with the Scots The Queenmother met him at Beauvois After some days stay he proceeded to Holland He agreed with the Scots commissioners and went to Scotland The duke of York staid at Jersey till the September of He went to Paris by the King's orders on the seventeenth But he left it on the fourth of October and came to Brussels on the thirteenth of the same month where he staid till the middle of December The prince of Orange died of the small pox on the sixth of November and the princess was delivered of a son on the fourteenth eight days after his death  He went to the Hague and staid till the twelfth of January when the English ambassador was there received and then went to Breda But some days after he returned to the Hague In June he was ordered by the King to return to Paris and follow the Queenmother's advice He arrived there in the end of June The King landed about the middle of October at Fescamp in Normandie and coming to Paris cardinal de Retz brought him a vast sum of money in his coach which the King would not receive not knowing when he should be able to pay it The cardinal shewed himself very affectionate to him He proposed his marriage with the duke of Orleans'a daughter The King visited  her often But she grew cool being put in the head of marrying the King of France and that the Queenmother would be forced to consent to it So the match was broke off Mademoiselle only daughter of the duke

the influence of the earl of Melfort who had become very disagreeable to many of James's friends in England There is a paper in his own hand after he had retired from St Germains entituled Memoire justificatif du comte de Melfort      Mai  This paper consists of twentyfour pages Melfort begins with observing that he had been in great favour with Charles and with James and that neither the changing his religion nor his rising so high in office had procured him any enemies "before the prince of Orange's arrival which he had always foretold without being believed but that he had drawn upon himself hatred and many enemies for the following reasons viz for having advised the King to accept of the assistance of France to send the prince of Wales into a place of safety and to seize the most considerable of his enemies before the prince of Orange's arrival"  When the earl of Sunderland was dismissed King James's business with the court of France was committed to Melfort He says he persuaded his master to accept of the assistance of France and having by his orders made the proposals to Barillon he received for answer that there were no troops now on the coast of France nor vessels to transport them This gave great offence to the English particularly to the earl of Middleton one of the secretaries of state Melfort was in danger of being assassinated such were the prejudices of the people against the French He was obliged to retire to France and had their Majesties orders to meet the prince of Wales at Dieppe where the prince would have landed if he had been sent according to their Majesties orders from Portsmouth Upon James's arrival at St Germains Melfort was made secretary of state for England and against his will was obliged to attend his Majesty to Ireland He dreaded  lord Tyrconnel's temper and pride He claims great merit to himself for having saved that kingdom by his invention of copper currency and from his other services and fatigues He left Ireland and exposed himself to be suspected of having been in disgrace with his master until it was seen that he was employed to execute a particular commission at Rome But still he says Sir Theophilus Oglethorp and his lady who is very intriguing and cunning continued to do him ill offices They thought it impossible that he should pardon them and therefore they retained their malice against him  Melfort was recalled from Rome where he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of the French ministry to act again as secretary of state He carried on the correspondence with England James's friends increased The King of France was induced to attempt an invasion and communicated his intentions to Melfort alone James from thenceforward never called to his council five Roman Catholic servants with whom he used to consult while Melfort was at Rome This step which Melfort opposed in vain created him many enemies  While Melfort was absent Montgomery whose father and grandfather were great enemies to the crown of Scotland proposed to the King and to the Queen by his emissaries and particularly by one Jones to seize the government The papers which concern this affair were delivered up to the ministry though Montgomery and Jones maintained the contrary as Melfort had foretold from Rome from his knowledge of the men who were to conduct it Montgomery on account of his hatred to the prince of Orange having gained credit with two or three of the King's friends began again to make proposals to the King and to give him information of some men of quality who were in his interest As these men in whose name Montgomery had advanced several things were for the prince of Orange and Whigs at bottom the King had reason to distrust him and ask an explanation Jones was sent over by Montgomery and when he arrived at St Germains instead of shewing who these men of quality were the King saw that he had nothing to expect from Montgomery and the correspondence was interrupted until Melfort returned from Rome except some letters which Montgomery wrote from time to time to Strafford soliciting money A person who was so attached to the King that he suffered the torture with great firmness without making any discovery was sent in the mean time by one of the King's loyal subjects from Scotland to inform him that Montgomery had declared at the table of the marquis of Montrose who is the King's great enemy that he also would be his enemy to his death  The correspondence was interrupted Jones at the instance of the King's friends in England was thrown into the Bastile Abbé Renaudot complained that Melfort received few letters from England and furnished him with no materials for his Gazette He went to see Jones in the Bastile Jones promised to renew  the correspondence and by Renaudot's means was allowed to make his escape When he arrived in England he blamed Melfort for his imprisonment  Melfort in the remaining part of this long memorial enlarges upon the prejudice done to him by the misrepresentations of Montgomery and Jones in England the intrigues of Abbé Renaudot in France his own difference of opinion with the Marquis de Croiffy

concerning the intrigues of the courts of St Germains and Barleduc during the years and It consists of numbers and almost every one of these numbers contains several letters But extracts have been made from them all as they occurred in the order of time consequently there is no occasion to take any notice of them here  Lettres et Memoires du Cardinal Gualterio Vols to  THESE two volumes contain Gualterio's correspondence and negociations during the years and They are almost all in Italian and consist of memorials to the Pope letters to Nairne and a few to the Chevalier de St George himself The cardinal was the Chevalier's agent at Rome The subjects of his letters and memorials are the severity of the oaths of allegiance on the English Roman CatholicksAn application to the Pope for a dispensation to take themLord Peterborough's arrest at BolognaSecret negociations about  the Chevalier's marriageNegociations with the court of Spain and an offer of Gibraltar and PortMahon providing that court placed the Chevalier on the British throneDifficulties attending the Chevalier's marriage and place of abodeColdness of the court of RomeVarious negociations and correspondences  Gualterio's letters are mostly in cyphers but the cantnames are easily explained Neither his letters nor his memorials are of much importance and accordingly few extracts have been made from them  VOLUMES VII VIII and IX QUARTO  THE first of these volumes is "a copybook of the earl of Middleton's letters begun at St Germains th April to th March " The second is "Entrys of some letters of the earl of Middleton's most of them writt by M from the th June to the Juillet with some letters of " And the third is "Entries of some letters writt to England to Abram and Berry c from to some by earl Middleton and most by N" Nairne  These letters throw considerable light on the intrigues of the times and every thing has been extracted from them that was any ways connected with the general history or with the private conduct and characters of individuals They are mostly allegorical and in cyphers and are often without a key but every thing of importance in them hath been explained by a careful attention to trace the chain of the correspondence and an unwearied application in comparing them with one another and in discovering the views connexions c of the several persons concerned Access to the letters to which these volumes contain answers would have greatly abridged this labour but perhaps have brought but few important facts to light  The late Mr Thomas Carte was a great collector of anecdotes From one vo and three to volumes of his memorandumbooks and a bundle of loose papers such of them have been inserted in the preceding volumes as were supported by collateral evidence and connected with the history of the period to which Mr Nairne's papers extend But as many of the papers collected by him in a large solio volume marked A L were not comprehended within this period it is necessary to give a more particular account of them He himself made some use of them to the year where his history ends It will be sufficient to give a list of those to which he has not referred and a

made any considerable alteration Though her Majesty expressed in her last to his Majesty her opinion for his going into Ireland yet she is a little troubled to find his Majesty hath taken his resolution to go thither before it came to him Mr Montague hath been heer this four days and returns to Pontoize tomorrow He is very much with the Queen and I believe we shall be able to know what her

that by no means his Majesty ought not to acknowledge the parliament of Scotland but in a full conclusion with them in which case there can be little sayd for the contrary only I am still of opinion that Windram is not to have a refusal but that his Majesty should send his answer into Scotland by deputies of his own instructed as amply towards their satisfaction as will stand with a good conscience voyd of scruples and without doing any prejudice either to his hopes of Montrose or to his present possession in Ireland and since the Scots have in a manner appeared for the crown Swedeland methinks it should be of no ill consequence that his deputies in case of disagreement in the treaty should provoke them to a decision by an arbitration of that crown But I am not ignorant

January    The following paragraph of this letter is in cyphers "The Emperor of Russia hath you know banished all English trade and the merchants are making up their packs as fast as they can But before they go I intend to demand of the Emperor of Muscow the custom unpaid for the English goods since they submitted to the new authority in England and if the Emperor will comply with the King's desire in any thing it will more probably be in this demand which is so notoriously grounded on his Majesty's right and which will not cost the said Emperor any thing out of his own purse This shall not slacken my endeavours in the rest literally in my instructions but shall only be a reserveThe duke of Courland as his agent at Amsterdam told me will lend his Majesty three good ships the least of twentyfive guns They are now in these parts but it ought to be concealed if accepted until they shall be at sea for many reasons M Wicford at the Hague will negotiate any thing with the agent who had orders to comply with the King's desire therein that you shall intimate He himself has a design to send two or three good ships to the East Indies with the King's commission and likewise with goods to trade if his Majesty thinks fit paying a good proportion of the value of the prizes to him I only propounded for you to judge of it as I do the raising of a very round sum upon the islands of Scilly upon a treaty to be made with these States Think well of this latter and whether the  King will be able to defend and relieve them this next summer But if he might receive  l  and they be put into the States' hands as caution only for the money whereby they should be defended by them and possibly they thereby insensibly engaged in the King's quarrel it might be no ill bargain"  A copy of King Charles the Second's letter to lord Loudon  A L folio page  Jersey January  The letter was sent by Mr Wyndram Charles appoints commissioners from Scotland to meet him at Breda Along with it was sent a letter to the clergy of Scotland    Charles in these letters promised to submit to the conditions which were proposed to him and particularly to acknowledge the convention of estates then assembled in Scotland to be a parliament At the same time he wrote a letter to the marquis of Montrose assuring him that he would make no concessions inconsistent with the powers he had given him in his commission and declaring that though he called them a committee of estates he was determined not to acknowledge them to be legally so This letter was intercepted and was of infinite prejudice to the King Abram Cowley on the th of March writes about it to secretary Long    in the following terms "No doubt it has done the King a great deal of hurt but it is very happy that it has missed of the chief end for which I conceive it was published which was to hinder the treaty That danger is now over and the only doubt remaining is whether the treaty will produce an agreement and I dare say all the world besides a few of our nation believe it so great a madness not to agree that they think it impossible to happen"    Anonymous letters with news from Leghorn April th and th  The Queenmother to the King

the earl of Argyle's defeat    June th  It is an account of facts which are well known  Extract of a letter from Sir John Percival    July th  He writes about the affairs of Ireland the hardships of the act prohibiting the Irish to trade directly to the plantations and the consequences of the proclamation calling in the arms of the militia  "This proclamation doth disquiet the minds of the militia especially of the common sort who are all fearful left endeavours should have been used to represent them to his Majesty as persons disaffected to his service and not fit to be trusted with arms though they are all English and universally in those parts Protestants of the church of England and have all taken the oaths of allegiance and supremacy a little before King Charles the Second's death such being then turned out as refused and the officers have all produced certificates of their having taken the sacrament as required by the church of England upon an order from the government of this kingdom about months since And many of the Irish gentlemen of this country openly spread abroad reports and tell the English themselves that their arms are thus called in to be given to them as the King's best subjects and that they say is the meaning of the proclamation in the expression used therein viz that the captains are to keep the arms for the use of the militia or such other uses as his Majesty may have for them This serves to disquiet the minds of the common people but the officers and all others of better sense are so well satisfied with his Majesty's gracious and royal opinion declared to the advantage of all the church of England principles that no such idle fear enters their thoughts but they wholly rely upon and acquiesce in the assurances given by his Majesty whose word they know is sacred and inviolable  People's fears of troubles here are very great especially if the rebel Monmouth should have any success which disturbance breeds a great deal of ill blood here between the English and the Irish the latter charging this rebellion on the whole body of the English and telling them that now their turn is come and that they will make the English of this country good subjects and the English on such occasions justifying themselves and telling them that though this be a rebellion in England yet it is only by the worst of the King's subjects there and that there are none but his subjects of England that appear in the King's service against them with abundance of other hot discourses of this kind that run about the country the Irish charging all the English universally hardly three excepted in all this country as devoted to Monmouth and not fit to be trusted by the King which language gives great offence and provocation to such of the English as hear it and administers greater occasion of jealousy between the Irish and them than formerly insomuch as each say they are afraid the others will cut their throats And some more fearful or disaffected than others speak of sermons being in many places preached by the friars of this country upon the th th and th verses of the ninth chapter of Ezekiel and though I cannot find any such sermon any where by them preached yet it serves to amuse and disquiet the ignorant sort of people and to prejudice the little trade that is going about the country nobody buying any thing of the countrymen insomuch that I have not been able to receive the sixth part of my rent in money and am fain to receive the rest in beef or corn or to go without itThe most apprehensive of my friends on this side the water have been advising me upon score of security to cross the sea and to go live privately in England and though I see not so much cause to fear or expectation of disturbance as they pretend to see yet because they desired me to move it to you I desire the favour of your advice about it It is upon the advice of our friends that we have thoughts of sending part of our stocke of
