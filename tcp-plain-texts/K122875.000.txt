 EPISTLE FROM Mr  Theophilus Cibber  Comedian TO Mr  Thomas Sheridan  Tragedian  It is a Kind of Slander to trust to Rumour  B JOHNSON  Bella horrida Bella  LUCAN  The Scene oft' rallies Follies of the Age  Laugh in your turn at Follies of the Stage  ANON  DUBLIN Printed in the Year MDCCXLIII  AN EPISTLE FROM Mr  Theophilus Cibber  Comedian TO Mr  Thomas Sheridan  Tragedian  Stephen'sgreen  Tuesday  Afternoon  July    Mr  SHERIDAN  YOUR injudicious Disappointment of the Company last  Thursday  who expected to see you in the Character of CATO and your indiscreet Attempt to dismiss the Audience having as you confess become a Towntalk and given Rise to many idle Falshoods meerly  calculated to injure the Innocent You must excuse me if I relate the Fact strictly adhering to Truth There were many Witnesses of what I am about to declare and I know none except yourself whose Memory is weak enough to forget it or will be hardy enough to deny it  When it drew near the Time proper to begin the Play Mr  Giffard  and myself were alarm'd in the Dressingroom with a Report that you declared you would not play because you had not the same Robe you wore in that Character before and that you said The Audience must be dismiss'd This Reason for dismissing an Audience propos'd by you who had no Right to dismiss them appear'd to me so weak I could not believe it till you came into the Room and swore Unless you had that Robe you would not act This Declaration I looked upon as a rash Expression the meer Effect of your then ruffled Temper but could not yet suppose you would proceed so idly as you did You were then compleatly dress'd from Head to Foot as well as ever the Character was dress'd in any Theatre in  Ireland  or  England  all but the Robe  Upon Enquiry it appeared the Robes wore by  Cato Juba  and  Sempronius  the first Night were borrowed by  Philips  of some Gentlewoman  in this Town who bought them in an Auction at  London  some Time since but were by no Means the Property of the Managers or any one belonging to the Theatre nor were to be got that Night so all the Heroes were equally disappointed of those Trappings Your Impatience increased and tho' another Robe was brought you the same Robe that was made new this Year for Mr  Husband  in the Character of  Julius Caesar  you persisted in having the other uncomeatable Robe or you positively would undress and was determined not to play To every body's Surprize you did undress and in spight of the most friendly Remonstrances to the contrary you made a broken kind of Speech to the Audience with which they were so dissatisfied they could not help shewing it  Before you went on I entreated you on the meer exchange of a Robe not to do so unpolitic a Thing I might add unpolite as to think of disappointing the Town of their Diversion You reply'd The Vexation had deprived you of your Voice and rendered you incapable of performing I desired you ro consider the first Act was of such a considerable Length you might have Time enough to recover your Temper and your Voice would probably return with it or if the Defect lasted your attempting to perform  would appear so obliging the Audience would readily make any Allowances when they knew you had been ruffled  c  but to think of giving them no Play at all was what I could not but conceive would offend them  To repeat all was said to you on this Occasion would add to the Tediousness of this Recital But as near as I can remember nothing was omitted in the most friendly Manner to dissuade you from your mistaken Purpose  I am informed you stay'd afterwards just long enough to hear the extraordinary indulgent Reception the Audience were pleased to bestow on my proposing with their Leave to give them the Play  in the best Manner we could since it was not in our Power to give it them so well as we would  You then ran hastily out of the House and sent a Message afterwards to the Theatre That you would not by any Means have your Name delivered out for another Play for you would positively act no more  I should not Mr  Sheridan  have given you or myself this Trouble but for the many Reports that fly about of which 'tis said you are the Author And since I have advanced so far I must go a little farther and make a  w honest  Queries  then giving you a little  Advice shall submit to the Determination of the Publick whether I as it has been insinuated ever intended you the least Prejudice or on the contrary have not always acted towards you with good Manners and good Nature  First thenhave I not your Letter by me sent to me when in  England  wherein you express yourself very desirous of my acting in the same Theatre with you and are solicitous for my coming overAnd do you not know your particular Application since my Arrival was one of my strongest Motives for playing in  SmockAlley  where I am likely to have a Lawsuit for my Right with the Managers tho' I was offer'd the same Terms from  AungierStreet  Playhouse where my Agreement would have been sign'd by a Gentleman of Honour whose Pay is as good as the Bank  Have I not on your Return to the Stage this Season in Compliment to you play'd some inferior Characters which 'tis well known I had a long time resign'd to younger Actors in  England  Did I omit any Care or grudge any Pains to keep the Audience in Temper when your sudden Indisposition prevented your playing the first intended Night of King  Lear  Or could  I for a Brother have been more Active to silence the Reports then made to your Prejudice  sed Tu Brute    Have not I desir'd you tho' our remaining Nights of Playing were few and we had large Sums at Stake to fix the Plays to your own Mind  Have not you been paid a large Part of that fresh Agreement you made but did not compleat while we are unpaid our Agreements tho' we have 'tis notorious often solicited the Managers to release us if they found the emptiness of the Town would not answer their continuing our PerformanceBut we could get neither our Liberty nor our Money  Have not you often been an Earwitness of these Proposals and as often declar  d we behav'd with the greatest Lenity and strictest Honour  Did not your sudden breaking off from Playing leave us in a displeasing Dilemma And was it not reasonable for us to propose acting such Pieces as might excite the greatest Curiosity in the Town whereby the Managers might be enabled to pay us and the rest of the Company  Did I not decline 'till your positive Declaration that you would play no more this Season appearing in any Character you had perform'd And did you not xpress yourself as oblig'd to me on making you that Compliment as you were pleas'd to term it  How comes it then Mr  Sheridan  reported that Mr  Giffard  and my self have intended you any injury Or from whence is it said that we ridiculous as false lock'd up your Cloaths and did all we could to prevent your Playing This Sir has been so frequently asserted as a Fact related by you that you ought as a Friend to Truth to have fully answer'd such monstrous Falshoods or may we not reasonably suppose you did spread such Reports If you can be the Author of such naughty Tales what Language is fit to paint you  The Letters I read this Day in the  Dublin Journal  if not  ipso facto  yours are yet so worded an impartial Reader cannot but see they were at least the Work of some mistaken Friend whose good Nature you had imposed on by false Relations From whom but you could come the  satisfactory Reasons not one of which are mentioned  for your not performing Or the poor low Invectives and mean Inuendoes therein containedWhom  do you mean by  Designing Wretches  and  Theatrical Politicians  Or what can you intend but to insinuate you have been artfully drove from the Stage when you know your Absence from thence is absolutely your own Act and Deed  Fie fie stick to Truth or be ashamed of such publick Addresses or to shew your Face after them  May not one suppose Master  Sheridan  the kind and civil Intention of these two Letters is to create a Disturbance in the future Audiences  But let me inform you when a Rebuff to an Actor appears premeditated and bespoke from Prejudice such Treatment may put a poor Player out of Humour but sure it ought not to put him out of Countenance  If you withdraw yourself from the Theatre for a Time must all Diversion stop till your Return If a Vintner has not  Ortelans  or any other extraordinary Dainties in the Larder will his Guests think it impertinent if they are intreated to take such homely Entertainment as the House affords And if the Defects of others serve as a Foil to the Brilliancy of your  Performance why should you be angry at what if you'd keep your Temper might prove so consolable to you  Dear  Tommy  don't prove such a Dog in a Manger if you don't chuse Oats why should you starve the rest of the Theatrical Cattle Have more Compassion on your fellow Creatures or fellow Comedians  But Master  Tommy  may we not shrewdly suspect tho' your Performances have been hitherto mostly tragical you have given your Mind a little Bent towards Comedy and in those Studies have taken a Hint from  Congreve  's  Petulant  who to keep up an extraordinary Reputation was notorious under a Disguise for calling for himself at a Coffeehouse where he would sometimes in a Mask send in for himself wait for himself nay and not finding himself would frequently  leave a Letter for himself  'Faith you are highly in Luck in improving a Hint I find  But let me ask you a home Question Has not a great deal of that suss of Mind you have lately shewn been more owing to your Disappointment that the Audience would not depart when you declar'd your high and mighty Displeasure because you had not the selfsame  gewgaw tinsel Train more than from any Fears you had of having displeas'd them Or was it nangry because any one was permitted under great Disadvantages meerly to attempt what they had never in their Lives a Thought of performing Why this is the passionate Extravaganza of our Brother PISTOL who scorning all Contradiction or Competition bounces about in his Boots kicks his Heels with Fury against the Stage and swell'd with swaggering Rage and Nonsense cries  Shall Dunghill Curs confront with  Helicon  cShall PackHorses and hollow pamper'd Jades of  Asia  that cannot travel thirty Miles a day compare with  Caesar  and with  Cannibals  and with  Trojan Greeks  c c  But as our Friend concludes  "Shall we fall foul for Toys  Tho' I don't think there is any thing personally terrible about you yet I own you a Gentleman of great Formidability who have the Power if you say true and you know you have talk'd at that pawpaw Rate of calling down the Barracks on any one you condescend to be displeas'd with Pray do you mean the Stone Buildings for I can't suppose you presume to have any Command over the Gentlemen there as I never heard of any Commission the King had yet honour'd you with and I believe there is hardly any there will think it worth their  while to attend the Call of your Whistle to a silly Riot I am rather inclinable to think the worthy Spirits there are more impatient to attend the Call of a Trumpet at this glorious Juncture and be in Actions worthy of them And for the Gentlemen of the College Sir no Insinuation shall make me dread ill Usage from those whose Birth and Education will never suffer 'em to hurt the Innocent nor can I affront 'em with so ungenteel a Thought that they will be the Tools of your wrong plac'd Resentment Mr  Sheridan  your Behaviour has extorted this from me and as your Conscience must tell you I never meant you the least Injury should you by any little Art aim thro' Pique or Passion unhospitably to hurt a Stranger it would be an Act that wants a Name and require such Language to answer as would but ill become the Mouth of a Gentleman or be fitting for the Ears of the Publick  As my Stay here will be very short I but desire what I will not doubt meeting with a candid Reception for the few Nights I have to play from the goodnatur'd Town whose past Favours I am proud of to confess them is but an Act of Gratitude Nor will I therefore think my self liable to the Imputation of a boasting VanityLet me Mr  Sheridan  give you this friendly CautionDo not run into an Error most young Men in our Business have been  too guilty of who think their Merits are but barely paid when their Reception is most favourable and take that as their Due which is mostly the Effect of a generous Disposition in the Town to encourage and support a rising Genius whenever it appearsTho' People may be as fond of such for a while as Gallants are of a new Mistress yet if Vanity and Caprice prevail in such Performer grown wild and wanton with Success they know when to withdraw their Favours nor is it easy to regain them If I ever see you in  England  I'll be most unmercifully reveng'd of you for your Mistakes towards me and will absolutely endeavour to make your Reception there as pleasing to you as you may have wish'd mine should have been here displeasing to me But let us now mind our Business and no more trouble the Publick with our TheatricalImportantNothings They will but laugh at us for our Pains  I am yours  c T C
