 THESPIS OR A CRITICAL EXAMINATION INTO THE MERITS of all the Principal PERFORMERS BELONGING TO DRURYLANE THEATRE  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY N  o  in LUDGATESTREET MDCCLXVI  THESPIS  BOLD is his task in this discerning age  When every witling prates about the stage  And some pert title arrogantly brings  To trace up nature thro' her noblest springs  Bold in such times his task must be allow'd  Who seeks to form a judgment for the croud  Presumes the public sentiment to guide  And speaks at once to prejudice and pride  Of all the studies in these happier days  By which we soar ambitiously to praise  Of all the fine performances of art  Which charm the eye or captivate the heart  None like the stage our admiration draws  Or gains so high and proper  an applause  Yet has this art unhappily no rules  To check the vain impertinence of fools  To point out rude deformity from grace  And strike a line'twixt acting and grimace  HIGH as the town with reverence we may name  And stamp its general sentiments to fame  Loud as perhaps we eccho to its voice  And pay a boundless homage to its choice  Still if we look minutely we shall find  Each single judge so impotent or blind  That ev'n the actor whom we most admire  For ease or humour dignity or fire  Shall often blush to meet the illearn'd bays  And pine beneath an infamy of praise  How ost soulsearching GARRICK have I hung  On every accent of that wond'rous tongue  When in Old LEAR returning into sense  And faintly guessing at some past offence  To gain CORDELIA'S pardon thou hast pray'd  And knelt by instinct with that suffering maid  How has my breast then labour'd with its sigh  And the big sorrow delug'd all my eye  While keen delight perform'd a traytor's part  And ach'd intensely round my struggling heart  Yet in those moments when I sought to find  An equal transport in the public mind  When I believ'd a sympathy wou'd shine  In every eye as honestly as mine  A lifeless pause perhaps has gloom'd along  And drowsy dulness sat upon the throng  Enormous curls have slept on empty blocks  Or wellbred curtsies shot from box to box  Whereas when prisoner and in fetters bound  A peal of praise has thunder'd all around  And every hand employ'd its utmost pains  To clap the mighty merit of the chains  WHEN things like these for ever give offence  And empty shew is listed over sense  When men throw nature negligently by  And judge not from the feelings but the eye  Nay when our actors in their busiest parts  While fear or hope stand beating at our hearts  From the warm scene may scandalously run  And feast the galleries with an instant pun  Then keeney'd satire consciously shou'd rise  And hold a mirror to the public eyes  Alike regardless of her foe or friend  With candour blame with honesty commend  Applaud if right the man she may detest  And strike if wrong the brother of her breast  'TIS on the stage as 'tis in life we find  No single man quite excellent in mind  Nor do we meet a bosom so deprav'd  So lost in vice and utterly enslav'd  But what at times some transient spark of grace  Has beam'd his eye and flush'd upon his face  With pitying warmth intuitively stole  And pierc'd the Stygian sable of his soul  Therefore unlike some brothers of the pen  Who judg'd of actors as they judg'd of men  In wild extremes ridiculously trod  And drew by turns a daemon or a god  My tints from life shall regularly glow  And paint both faults and beauties as they grow  Convinc'd the truest pictures must be made  Where light is blended properly with shade  LONG in the annals of theatric fame  Has truth grac'd GARRICK with a foremost name  Long in a wide diversity of parts  Allow'd his double empire o'er our hearts  Either in mirth to laugh us to excess  Or where he weeps to load us with distress  Nor is it strange that e'en in partial days  He gains so high an eminence of praise  When his united requisites are more  Than ever centred in one mind before  Say if we search minutely from the age  In which old THESPIS first began the stage  And range thro' all the celebrated climes  In which it flourish'd to the present times  Where shall we find an actor who has prest  With such extensive force upon the breast  Fill'd such opposing characters for years  Unmatch'd alike in laughter or in tears  Others perhaps the greatest of their hour  Whom fame extoll'd as prodigies of power  Have yet to scanty limits been confin'd  And shewn but one dull tendency of mind  On bold blankverse heroically rose  Or meanly ambled upon humbler prose  OTHELLO's form a B  TTERTON might wear  And rend the soul with horror and despair  BOOTH might with conscious majesty declaim  And build on CATO a substantial name  In WILDAIR WILKES most certainly might soar  And CIBBER's sop set millions in a roar  But which of these like GARRICK cou'd appear  In ROMEO SHARPE in DRUGGER and in LEAR  Fill the wide rounds of passion as they fall  And shine with equal excellence in all  YET tho' thus warm I freely pour my thoughts  I still must think that GARRICK has his faults  Some casual errors in his parts which run  As specks sometimes will fasten on the sun  Ev'n in his LEAR where desperately wild  He stabs the ruffians to preserve his child  And quite worn out with tenderness and rage  Leans wholly spent and breathless on the stage  Then while the tide of sympathy has rose  And every bosom labour'd with his woes  Then have I seen him negligently fall  Full with his face against the prison wall  Snatch every feature strangely from our sight  And check the flood of exquisite delight  THO' fam'd APELLES at a touch cou'd give  The warming canvass almost how to live  Tho' scarce to less than deity when grown  He call'd out new creations of his own  Yet when the weakness of his art he saw  The Grecian father's agony to draw  'Twas wise a veil upon his face to throw  Whose pangs he found impossible to shew  But when even Shakespear never cou'd possess  Too big a grief for GARRICK to express  When his sharp eye so piercingly can roll  And dart such instant passions thro' the soul  Tis doubly wrong the tenderer the case  To hide the wond'rous workings of his face  To check our hopes or play upon our fears  And damp the richsoul'd luxury of tears  FOR five long years in dark oblivion thrown  Has LEE remain'd neglected and unknown  Unless when chance on some capricious start  Has kindly blest him with a decent part  Yet was this LEE at one auspicious hour  Allow'd to boast a little share of power  Was thought in various characters to please  And fam'd no less for energy than ease  For me who feel a tenderness of breast  Where'er a dawn of merit seems opprest  I may perhaps be partial to his faults  And do him more than justice in my thoughts  But when I see the genuine passions rise  Which flame in ABOAN's red resenting eyes  When I behold in VERNISH's disgrace  The struggling soul so stampt upon the face  Or meet in BELMONT with that dangerous art  Which even for crimes can plead about the heart  I own it wounds my temper and my taste  To find him still so despicably plac'd  Sent on in FRENCHMEN RALEIGHS and GLENDOWERS  While things like PACKER surfeit us for hours  'Tis true that LEE has fatally imbib'd  A mode of speech not easily describ'd  A nice affected drawlingness of phrase  A wiredrawn tone in every thing he plays  With which too oft most execrably fine  He racks a word and tortures out a line  Yet still has LEE a consequence of form  A voice and look so capable to warm  A stage struck heat so vehemently strong  With such a piercing consciousness of wrong  That even when BARRY in his noblest course  Some few weeks since exerted all his force  Strain'd every nerve to draw the scattering crown  And cramm'd his mooney'd idiot on the town  Then did this LEE burst on us in a blaze  And wake us all to wonder and to praise  Give vile IAGO'S deeply scheming ire  The boldest touches of dramatic fire  And swell the gen'rous PIERRE with a flame  That left even JAFFIER but a second fame  Hence mean soe'er as managers may prize  I look on LEE with very different eyes  And freely place however they disdain  His chair next GARRICK'S high in DruryLane  THE greatest charge our little judges lay  When HOLLAND'S worth they critically weigh  Is that in all the characters he tries  His master GARRICK ever fills his eyes  That meanly servile in his walk of parts  He strives to shine by imitative arts  And now so dull a copiest is grown  To want all sense and feeling of his own  In this nice age when fatally disgrac'd  Poor sense falls martyr'd at the shrine of taste  When a mere word indefinite and vain  The random coinage of the coxcomb's brain  By truth and judgment wholly unconsin'd  And differing still in ev'ry different mind  Usurps the air of sentiment to pass  For sterling gold her despicable brass  Then imitation certainly must fall  And raise the general enmity of all  Must own the pridetaught sentence to be just  And lick the foot that tramples it in dust  Yet sure if GARRICK hitherto has ran  By reason's line and justly laid his plan  On that exalted principle of art  Which knocks with truth's bold hand against the heart  If in the various characters he plays  The genuine form of nature he conveys  And hits in short upon that happy right  Which gives the finest essence of delight  Those who affect to turn away the head  When HOLLAND seeks his vestiges to tread  Must argue less from judgment than from whim  Since copying nature is to copy him  But why at all should critics proudly start  And seem to frown on imitative art  Where worth or fame our admiration raise  A wish to copy is a kind of praise  Say in this age some genius shou'd we find  So rich in thought and vigorous in mind  As gave the fury of a stage desire  Even the pale glimm'ring of a SHAKESPEAR'S fire  Should we not all inevitably throng  To hail the glowing wonders of his song  And with a wild munificence reward  The faintest traces of our deathless bard  For me unapt to criticise In haste  And little guilty of a modern taste  I own this HOLLAND ever my offence  But where he draws from GARRICK and from sense  While he does this I patiently attend  And often find no little to commend  With honest warmth his plaudit I can hear  And join myself the tribute of a tear  But when some airborn fancy to pursue  He lets his master once escape his view  When much too great for imitation grown  He boldly seeks a manner of his own  Sententious dull and heavy he appears  His words like weights hang dragging on our cars  Fatigues to death in spite of all our power  And drawl the minute's sentence to an hour  Nor is this all a stupid sort of stare  A starch'd stiff stalking aukwardness of air  Absorb at once his figure and his face  And scorn all marks of nature and of grace  While the purs'd lips to wind up ev'ry pause  Important swell and bully for applause  FEW for so short an interval have gain'd  A higher rank than POWELL has obtain'd  And few in fact at present on the stage  Deserve a warmer notice from the age  Form'd with some lines that happily express  No little sense of pity and distress  And form'd with tones that frequently impart  No little share of softness to the heart  On many minds he tenderly can steal  And teach a drowsy auditor to feel  Hence in those parts where wretchedness and years  Alarm alike our pity and our fears  Where the poor LUSIGNAN from prison led  Shakes the white honours of his sacred head  O'er his sweet Pagan tenderly complains  And calls again for darkness and for chains  Or where old HENRY sick'ning with despair  Upbraids the wildness of his madcap heir  In parts like these to POWELL I attend  A strong admirer and a steady friend  But when in gay LOTHARIO he wou'd shew  The sprightly airs of libertine and beau  Or give in TOWNLY to a modish wi  e  The nicer touches of superior life  Not all the scrapes or cringes which he tries  Those paltry arts of little men to rise  The scorn of sense and judgment can remove  Or teach one honest blockhead to approve  As yet two raw young striplings on the stage  Unfit for fight tho' burning to engage  Led on by hope courageously to press  Yet taught by sense to practise for success  No judgment now of CAUTHERLY I frame  Nor settle BENSLY'S title to a name  Where first essays are diffidently tried  A candid mind must cautiously decide  Nor rashly risque opinions which in time  The muse herself may censure as a crime  WHERE the gay muse in laughter loves to sport  And brisk THALIA holds her hum'rous court  YATES with high rank for ever must be plac'd  Who blends such strict propriety with taste  From nature's fount so regularly draws  And never seeks to trick us of applause  Mark when he plays no vacancy of face  No wand'ring eye or ignorant grimace  Is rudely suffer'd once to intervene  Or check the growing business of a scene  Nay in his silence happily employ'd  He looks continual meaning on the void  Bids every glance with character be fraught  And swells each muscle with a burst of thought  Hence in those cruder sections of a part  Where want of humour must be fill'd by art  Where the poor poet in some luckless fit  Mistakes a dull prolixity for wit  His merit shines with undiminish'd rays  And lifts whole troops of RESTLESS'S to praise  Yet there are times when spite of all his care  Our taste must bristle and our sense must stare  When a new part unhappily he plays  A thousand doubts perplex him and amaze  Fast from himself he tremblingly retires  Nor trusts that worth which all the world admires  But on a sea of causeless terror tost  Allows both mind and memory to be lost  But tho' on YATES the comic muse may shower  An ample fund of humour and of power  Tho' in his walk of characters he claims  So high a place among theatric names  Still there are others in her smiles who share  And prove her generous as they know her fair  Oft in some whim the buxom nymph will try  To pass for KING upon the public eye  On TOM or RANGER wantonly will seize  And give us all his spirit and his ease  Again in PRATTLE physically prim  She steals each look and attitude from him  And like a virgin whose unpractis'd breast  Some blooming youth entirely has possess'd  Who if mischance unhappily should start  To wound the face that captivates her heart  Feels no unkind propensity to rove  But throbs all pitying with a soster love  So when emaciate with disease and years  Her fav'rite KING in OGLEBY appears  The comic muse exerts unusual force  To call down laughter from its richest source  Glows with a flame additionally warm  And seems in more than raptures with his form  O that the goddess in some lucky hour  Wou'd wisely try the utmost of her power  Wou'd tell her KING that in the wellbred smart  Too great a pertness quite destroys the part  And when a BASSET'S habit he wou'd wear  Dismiss the saucy SMATTER from his air  VERNON to favour ne'er can have pretence  A singer truly and disgac'd with sense  Why should a fellow blest with such a strain  As still can charm us to the verge of pain  The melting soul in extasy absorb  And almost pluck a planet from its orb  Why should he strive in such a singsong age  To soar by sterling merit on the stage  Or seek by knowledge in dramatic laws  To reach a vulgar MASCULINE applause  Did he indeed ne'er generously rise  Beyond the TOM  TALE or the LONDON CRIES  With which of late so dead to every shame  He meanly pimp'd for prostituted fame  Some room for easy pardon might be found  And dullness join most lovingly with sound  But when PHARNACES or MACHEATH we see  So nerv'd with thought so spirited and free  When ev'n his flimsiest characters of song  Can strike our minds so wonderfully strong  Our honest rage eternally must live  And prudence make it madness to forgive  PALMER from playing almost every night  Has grown so long familiar to our sight  That even in scenes scarce possible to bear  We kindly rate him as a decent player  Yet since the stage its first existence drew  An odder compound never struck our view  Nor did the drama ever yet produce  So bad an actor half so fit for use  Mark with what grace his person is design'd  For parts of life and characters refin'd  Yet that strange shambling of deportment see  Tho' easy stiff and manacled tho' free  Tho' strait yet doubled tortur'd tho' in form  Aukward tho' bred and spiritless tho' warm  Tho' fraught with tones articulate and clear  He keeps an endless screaming on the ear  Howls out young OAKLEY in such hideous strains  As midnight wolves might use upon the plains  And strangles poor Sir BRILLIANT in a note  Too nicely horrid for a human throat  But tho' in wide and capital respects  I see in PALMER manifest defects  Tho' that address so terrible must seem  And that vile voice excruciate with its scream  Yet ever ready in the heaviest parts  He scorns all aid from despicable arts  And ever master of his author's aim  Just to his sense and cautious of his same  With secret pleasure I behold him rise  And cry "Peace" always to my ears and eyes  IF strong good sense and latitude of mind  A keen conception and a taste refin'd  A long acquaintance with those nicer arts  That read thro' life and study thro' our hearts  An actor's name with certainty might raise  Or bind his temples with the generous bays  Who against LOVE a syllable cou'd breathe  Or once dispute his title to a wreathe  But 'tis not taste or judgment which can give  An actor's name eternally to live  Or even the widest knowledge of mankind  Which stamps thro' time his image on the mind  Hence tho' in FALSTAFF Love has oft exprest  A nice observance of the human breast  Tho' in his BAYS we readily admire  The critic's clearness and the actor's fire  Yet when we see him on GRANADA'S throne  The dupe of ZARA'S fury and his own  Or mark in GLOSTER with what nerveless rage  He drives poor SHORE to wander from the stage  We all lament the cruelty of fate  Which damns so good an actor into state  And find these sceptres quite as dangerous things  To mimic monarchs as to actual kings  IN foreign footmen BADDELY alone  Preserves the native nasilness of tone  And in his manner strongly shews ally'd  Their genuine turn of abjectness and pride  If proofs are wanting on CANTON I call  And ask the general sentiments of all  Here then secure of competence and name  He ought to rest his fortune and his fame  And not in buckish epilogues which spring  With real life from nobody but KING  At random risque the favour which we shower  On scenes more suited to his taste and power  BLEST with the happiest nothingness of form  Which nature e'er with being strove to warm  On life's just scale scarce capable to stand  A kind of mandrake in creation's hand  See DODD in all his tininess of state  Resist his stars and counteract his fate  On actual wants preposterously shine  Absurdly great and despicably fine  Fram'd at his birth a coxcomb for the stage  He soars the foremost fribble of the age  And struck by chance on some egregious plan  A mere nice prim epitome of man  In every coinage of the poet's brain  Who blends alike the worthless and the vain  Who in such parts as FADDLE has design'd  A fopling's figure for a villain's mind  There DODD'S fine want of all exterior weight  New points our laugh or doubly whets our hate  Hangs the vile slave more openly in morn  And brands him still with aggravated scorn  But when at WILDAIR'S elegance he tries  Or seeks in wellbred NOVELTY to rise  When on those parts he fatally will strike  Which urge no scorn and furnish no dislike  There all his price inanity misplac'd  Disgusts alike our judgment and our taste  There he provokes our ridicule or rage  And melts poor WILDAIR down into a page  'TIS true in life we frequently behold  A daring spirit in the smallest mould  And ne'er from face or person think to find  The latent turn of principle or mind  But in the drama with creative fire  We give each part the person we desire  Expect all grace in BEVIL'S shou'd be seen  But ask for SNEAK'S diminutive and mean  Hence if deceiv'd that fascinating rage  Which nerves the scene and vivifies the stage  Calls out illusion thro' the roar of strife  And warms the moral fiction into life  That instant flags no more to be possess'd  And spreads one torpid dullness thro' the breast  BORN to delight a laughterloving age  And give fresh sunds of humour to the stage  Mark with what strength of unaffected ease  That happy WESTON commonly can please  Tho' bold yet simple forcible tho' cool  Fine without trick and finish'd without rule  In those still scenes of  scarce existing  life  Where SNEAK breathes only to oby a wife  Or where poor DRUGGER publicly display'd  Hangs out the mere dull animal of trade  There WESTON'S worth with certainty may rest  Nor fear the strictest rigidness of test  There a sublime stupidity of face  As dead to sense as destitute of grace  A fix'd relaxless vacancy of lines  With such true genius generally shines  That quite surpriz'd tho' satisfied we gaze  And all is mirth astonishment and praise  Of all the walks in which the humorous power  Of comic wit can exercise an hour  Perhaps that cold inanimated way  In which an actor never seems to play  In which the chiefest merit of a part  Exists entirely in the want of art  The strongest force of requisites may claim  And prove the hardest avenue to fame  To WESTON'S praise then generously true  The muse shall raise him publicly to view  A first rate actor of the NOKES'S kind  Best when least shewn and happiest when confin'd  But when by some fatality misled  A rage for praise has overset his head  When grown quite arch he madly quits his place  And seeks to soar by pertness and grimace  When in attempting at some paltry joke  The fine dry dullness of his face is broke  With just disdain I turn my head aside  And damn alike his ignorance and pride  To say that HAVARD never has a claim  To some small portion of theatric fame  To say quite roundly that we never shed  Some transient gleams of favour on his head  The public knowledge grosly would abuse  And fix a lasting stigma on the muse  Yet when our eye upon his claim we throw  And see what lifeless plaudits we bestow  When thro' his round of requisites we trace  Think on his voice his figure and his face  And find plain sense and memory at most  Are all the mighty merits he can boast  We steal in pity from our stricter plan  To praise his private virtues as a man  And while the charms of genuine worth engage  Detest the hour he first beheld a stage  HURST with his talents for life's ancient scenes  Must rise in time if mindful of the means  But when with years and with diseases bow'd  What need of tones extravagantly loud  LAURENCE may counsel and express his fears  Yet shew some kind attention to our ears  And woeworn ADAM may exclaim for bread  Without once splitting a spectator's head  He who would seize an andience by the heart  Shou'd always judge the nature of his part  And in proportion as the scene requires  Suppress the talentworking of his fires  Since too much force propriety destroys  And whitehair'd grief is never mark'd by noise  Should poor old LEAR forget his tott'ring gait  To ape young AMMON'S majesty and state  Or godlike CATO from his seat advance  To treat the grinning gallery with a dance  With what a wild amazement would we stare  And check the mad'ning progress of the player  If then with HURST we mildly wou'd engage  And ask the various properties of age  Wou'd palsied limbs be all he wish'd to own  Or wou'd he give it feebleness of tone  BUT mark with what vulgarity of stare  What low unmeaning impudence of air  That mudey'd MOODY whose relentless face  No blush e'er crimson'd with a moment's grace  Gapes  round the house regardless of his part  All brass in front and marble all in heart  For him no scene however it may flow  With highwrought wit or agonizing woe  Once on his breast can fortunately steal  Or teach that ruthless bosom how to feel  Yet tho cut off from every just pretence  To taste to nature decency and sense  Tho' no blest beam of sympathy e'er stole  To rouze the deep stagnation of his soul  Still while O'CUTTER happily can please  With brainless bravery and with brutal ease  While every human principle of breast  Falls vily martyr'd to an IRISH jest  There his wide want of sentiment and shame  So nicely tallies with the poet's aim  That truth herself must combat in his cause  And yield the crown of infamous applause  NOT so the modest ACKMAN strikes our view  Whose parts tho' neither eminent nor new  Still from his strict propriety and care  Must here be rank'd a tolerable player  Small as his round of characters appear  He ne'er offends our vision or our ear  But always decent perfect and in place  Fills his short walk with judgment and with grace  'Tis not a circuit of five hundred lines  Thro' which a hero rants away or whines  That e'er an actor's merit can decide  Or serve the candid critic for a guide  The poor plain soldier while the battle glows  Who darts courageous on his gath'ring foes  With dauntless breast beholds his danger rise  And nobly scorns to shudder tho' he dies  Is in my thought a much more worthy name  Than he who dead to honour and to shame  Howe'er hung round with title or command  Intrench'd in dastard discipline can stand  On doubtful orders hesitate to fight  And rush on noonday error to be right  BRANSBY to greatness never makes pretence  Yet seldom strikes at decency or sense  But humbly careful thro' the round he plays  Avoids all censure if he meets no praise  AICKIN has various requisites to please  A handsome person and an inborn case  A manly accent forcible and clear  A ready memory and a happy ear  And if the poet with prophetic verse  Thro' fate's dark womb can accurately pierce  An hour will come when time's improving hand  Shall teach his taste and judgment to expand  And in dramatic annals mark him fair  Tho' not a great a serviceable player  BURTON is one of those unnotic'd things  Who make good lords or secondary kings  The liveliest mind to stupefaction lull  So wisely flat and rationally dull  And yet with all that wond'rous weight of lead  Which bounteous fate has given him for a head  He still possesses such amazing arts  To rise quite perfect in the heaviest parts  That all with me must highly praise his pains  And own his memory tho' they doubt his brains  BUT now let justice doubly arm the muse  And tenfold candour consecrate her views  For now her genuine equity of breast  Must stand a keen unmitigating test  And those who think that friendship or offence  Are yet unmingled in the poet's sense  May fear when female characters he draws  Lest truth shou'd suffer from a softer cause  Indeed where female merit must be tried  'Tis hard to judge and dangerous to decide  A secret something in our breasts will warm  Where eyes can lauguish and where lips can charm  And age itself instinctively will glow  To press a ball of animated snow  But yet thro' all the pleadings we can trace  The wond'rous pleadings of a heavenly face  The bard still mindful of desert alone  All partial ties will honestly disown  From sacred conscience shudder to depart  And speak his judgment tho' he wounds his heart  VINCENT and WRIGHT for what the poet cares  May warble sweetly thro' some trifling airs  But till some ray of kind perception rests  With genial heat upon their mindless breasts  They still must raise our pity or offence  Whene'er they claim an intercourse with sense  NOT so the gentle BADDELEY whose form  Sweet as her voice can never fail to charm  Whose melting strain no ARNE'S eccentric skill  As yet has tortur'd into modern thrill  She if our bosoms are not wholly steel  In poor OPHELIA forces us to feel  From envy's self roots up the ling'ring sigh  And spreads red anguish o'er her mad'ning eye  Yet of such gifts tho' happily possest  She rather  grows  than  rushes  on the breast  And rather wins the passions to her course  Than strives to storm them by immediate force  Hence in the soft and tender walks alone  Her latent fund of talents must be shewn  And here a just distinction she must bear  If train'd with proper nicety and care  BARRY has tones which instantly impart  An aking sense of pleasure to the heart  But where a firstrate eminence we claim  How small a title is a voice to fame  HOPKINS in MILLWOOD and the thirdrate cast  To public favour rushes on so fast  That tho' unequal widely to engage  With many first class parts upon the stage  Still if her rank we accurately trace  And give her worth due eminence of place  Not six perhaps thro' BRITAIN we shall find  But what she leaves considerably behind  FORM'D for those coarse and vulgar scenes of life  Where lowbred rudeness always breathes in strife  Where in some blessed unison we find  The deadliest temper with the narrowest mind  The boldest front that never knew a fear  The flintiest eye that never shed a tear  There not an actress certainly alive  Can e'er dispute preeminence with CLIVE  There boldly warm yet critically true  The actual woman blazes on our view  From self struck feeling nobly draws her praise  And soars in  act the character she plays  But when to taste she makes the least pretence  Or madly aims at elegance and sense  When at high life she despicably tries  And flares her frowsy tissue on our eyes  There the wide waddle and the ceaseless bawl  Provoke the general ridicule of all  And nought but NEWGATE LUCY we can know  Trick'd out and dizen'd for some city shew  POPE tho' undamn'd with any casual part  Of  weak head or execrable heart  Yet with almost her readiness enjoys  A coarse wrote scene of turbulence and noise  And like CLIVE too in those superior spheres  Where ease delights and elegance endears  That shapeless form to grace so unally'd  That roaring laugh and manliness of stride  In spite of pity force us to be just  And all we feel is hatred of disgust  Is it not odd that still upon the stage  So few attend to person or to age  That aukward clumsy or distorted shapes  Like new caught bears or badly tutor'd apes  Fast from those parts ridiculously crowd  In which their honest merits are allow'd  To stain some high and educated place  Which asks the finest polishes of grace  Is it not odd too that the hoary head  By some strange daemon ludicrously led  From those grave casts eternally withdraws  In which it still can totter with applause  To mumble quite insensible of shame  Some scene all youthful energy and flame  But such alas is ignorance or pride  That self still kindly will for self decide  And while the passions rule the giddy hour  We all mistake our wishes for our power  BUT see where sprightly ABINGTON appears  Happy alike in person and in years  Pleasing tho' pert familiar tho' polite  Nervous tho' free and spirited tho' light  As long as ease vivacity or fire  Can find a chearful audience to admire  With just regard her talents it will rate  Strong if not fine and various if not great  PRITCHARD tho' now unequal to her prime  And withering swiftly on the stalk of time  Yet still retains a magic kind of art  To charm the eye and twist about the heart  Throws some refin'd delusion o'er the stage  And quite absorbs infirmity and age  Yet form'd perhaps the moment of her birth  For humour chiefly elegance and mirth  Her tragic parts are less replete with life  Than ESTIFANIA or the Jealous Wife  Hence tho' I always honestly admire  Her MACBETH's madness and her ZARA's fire  Still when I see her obviously distrest  To hurl the passion strongly on my breast  When I behold her in this dang'rous course  Struggling for strength and straining after force  I wish her kindly in that walk of ease  Where every line instructed how to please  Springs from her lips superlatively warm  Sure to delight and positive to charm  O that the hour whene'er it is design'd  To bless the well known virtues of her mind  On PALMER's breast might charitably shower  Some distant dawnings of the mother's power  One casual gleam of PRITCHARD might dispense  And wake the beauteous statue into sense  That no just censure on our fav'rite's race  May brand her name with relative disgrace  YATES with such wond'rous requisites to charm  Such powers of face and majesty of form  Such genuine grandeur with such sweetness join'd  So clear a voice and accurate a mind  In fame's first feat must certainly be plac'd  While BRITAIN boasts of judgment or of taste  Say in what walk of greatness or of grace  This matchless woman justly shall we place  In which she still possesses not an art  To melt to fire to agonize the heart  If in CORDELIA to our minds we raise  The more than magic softness she displays  Will not a gush of instant pity spring  To mourn the father and lament the king  Or when the hapless BELVIDERA's tale  Of brutal RENAULT turns the husband pale  Does not the force with which she then exclaims  Light every eyeball into instant flames  Rage with a fire too big to be exprest  And rend the coldest fibres of the breast  But tho' unequall'd in those tragic parts  Which fall with weight and hang about our hearts  'Tis not on these she wholly rests her name  Or builds a title to dramatic fame  Mark in the gayer polish'd scenes of life  The sprightly mistress or the highbred wife  What wond'rous grace and dignity unite  To fill us still with exquisite delight  Mark how that nameless elegance and ease  Can teach e'en MURPHY'S ribaldry to please  With actual life his cold BELINDA warm  And tell that whining LOVEMORE how to charm  Peace to thy shade and may the laurel bloom  With deathless green O CIBBER on thy tomb  Peace wond'rous OLDFIELD ever wait thy shrine  Thou once chos'n priestess of the sacred nine  For while this YATES the utmost reach can show  Of comic grace or souldistracting woe  We find no reason for the sorrowing tear  Which else wou'd fall incessant on your bier  CURSE on that bard's malignity of heart  How fraught soe'er with energy or art  Who once thro' YATES'S requisites cou'd trace  Yet find no dawn of meaning in her face  Oft CHURCHILL often when BELLARIO'S fears  His saith his wrongs have plung'd us into tears  Has the sweet anguish of this YATES'S sighs  Forc'd that stern bosom instantly to rise  Oft as her fine ductility of breast  Some newborn passion on the bosom prest  Taught the soft ball more meltingly to roll  And drew out every feature into soul  Then have I seen this censor who cou'd find  No glance whatever vivified with mind  Lost in a storm of unaffected woe  Till pitying nature bid the torrent flow  Reliev'd the tortur'd bosom thro' the eye  And gave his sentence publicly the lye  YET high soever as the poet rates  The wellknown worth and excellence of YATES  He cannot give perfection to her share  Nor say she's wholly faultless as a player  Sometimes her sense too exquisitely strong  By needless force will deviate into wrong  And sometimes too to throw this fault aside  She blends too little tenderness with pride  What need CALISTA ent'ring on the stage  Exclaim "Be dumb for ever" in a rage  Her faithful woman gives her woes relief  And justice calls for temper tho' for grief  Again when MODELY stands reveal'd to view  And comes all suppliant to a last adieu  What need that cold indifference of air  That stiff unbending haughtiness of stare  'Tis true the wretch deserves our utmost scorn  Yet her resentment is but newly born  And we shou'd read distinctly in her eyes  That still she loves howe'er she may despise  Where women once a passion have profess'd  They may resent but never can detest  Nor where the basest fav'rite they discard  Conceal all marks of pity and regard  THUS has the poet on old DRURY tried  With care to judge and candour to decide  And shou'd the kind indulgence of the times  Approve thus far his motley string of rhimes  His aim he yet more widely may pursue  And BEARD'S light squadrons in their turn review  Thro' all the pomp of coronations pierce  And give their best manoeuvres in his verse  Here for the present then he drops his plan  Puts off the critic and assumes the man  Convinc'd if truth shou'd only warm his muse  The PUBLIC smile will still promote her views  And conscious too shou'd prejudice or pride  Appear alone her sentiments to guide  The PUBLIC scorn her pen must cease to brand  The sooner justice strikes it from her hand  FINIS  ERRATA  Page  Line            for Fatigues  read Fatigue
