 AN ESSAY ON THE Genius and Writings OF  SHAKESPEAR  WITH Some Letters of Criticism to the SPECTATOR  By Mr DENNIS  Me Lectori credere malim  Quam Spectatoris fastidia ferre superbi  Horace  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT at the  CrossKeys  between the  Two TempleGates  in  Fleetstreet  Price  s  To the Right Honourable GEORGE GRANVILLE  Esq  Secretary at War  SIR  AN Address of this Nature made upon your Advancement to one of the principal Employments of the State and made by one who has had the Honour to be known to you so many Years might be pretended by malicious People to be a Homage rather to your Fortune and Power than a due Respect to your Merit and Vertue if it were not publickly known that I formerly applied my self to you in the same manner when you were  much more distingnished by Merit and Vertue than by Fortune and Power  But if any one farther maliciously urges that even when I formerly applied my self to you by the distinguishing Qualities of your Mind and Person I foresaw your Fortune and Power to him I answer in order to vindicate the Reputation of my Sincerity and my Disinterestedness that tho' I saw very well that those great Qualities fitted Mr  Granville  for the most Illustrious Employments yet who could have ever imagin'd that any Man living had Merit enough to raise him in spight of so many unfortunate Vertues with which that Merit was attended in spight of not only a true Poetical Genius but a Frankness a Probity a matchless Integrity a Sincerity worthy of Heroick Times and a most untainted Honour  But tho' your Character were less conspicuous and what I had formerly done were intirely forgot the numerous and  powerful Obligations I have to you would more than justifie this Address and the omitting the first Opportunity of making you a publick Acknowledgment would look like black Ingratitude You have taken such Care of my Interest with others at a most seasonable Conjuncture and have your self made me a Present so noble and so extraordinary at a time when I stood most in need of it that how few alive have Spirit and Magnanimity to do any thing like it At least I defie any one to name that living Man who in a private Capacity has done any thing like it  I know very well indeed that you are very far from desiring such a publick Acknowledgment that you aim at nothing by doing daily good but the Godlike Pleasure which results from your Actions and that others perhaps may censure me for sacrificing your Modesty to my own Vanity For to publish to the World that I have been oblig'd in  an extraordinary  by a Person so universally esteem'd and  stinguish'd that one of the very few Things in which the most violent of both Parties agree is the Character of Mr  Granville  will be thought to be the Result of uncommon Vanity by those who have not Goodness enough to believe it to be the Effect of a lively Gratitude  But tho' Sir I had no Obligation to you and you had no other Merit but that of perfectly understanding an Art which you have perfectly practis'd  viz  the Art which is the Subject of the following Treatise that Treatise would be by Right of Nature yours For to whom can an Essay upon the Genius and Writings of  Shakespear  be so properly address'd as to him who best understands  Shakespear  and who has most improv'd him I would not give this just Encomium to the  Jew of Venice  if I were not convinc'd from a long Experience of the Penetration and Force of  your Judgment  no Exaltation can make you a  m'd of your former noble Art that you know it to be a Weakness barely to imagine that the most noble and most exalted of all Arts and the most difficult to excel in can render a Man less qualified for publick Business or for the first Employments of the State that all the great Statesmen who have best succeeded in Affairs of Government have either writ Poems or Treatises concerning Poetry The most ancient of Historians and Legislators  Moses  at least of those whose Laws and Histories remain has given us a pathetick and a lofty Poem upon the Passage of the  Red Sea  The  Athenian  Legislator  Solon  thought it not in the least below his Dignity to render Moral Vertue lovely by the Charms of Verse And  Lacedemonian Licurgus  even the rigid and the austere  Lycurgus  thought it an Employment worthy of his Wisdom and Vertue to restore  and publish the Immortal Works of  Homer  Having the same Opinion of that Prince of Poets that  Horace  afterwards had that his Poems would better instruct Mankind in Vertue than they could be possibly taught by Prose The most Illustrious Writers of Politicks among the  Grecians    Plato  and  Aristotle  one of them had a figurative a lofty and a Poetick Prose and the other who may be call'd the Legislator of  Parnassus  wrote the Laws of Tragedy so exactly and so truly in Reason and Nature that succeeding Criticks have writ justly and reasonably upon that Art no farther than they have adhered to their great Master's Notions  Tacitus  the very Oracle of Modern Statesmen has a Stile that is warm and daring and figurative that is to say Poetick  Machiavel  the Prince of Modern Politicians if we except but one of our own Countrymen wrote more than one Comedy and more than one Poem has been attempted by  our  British  Politician  Harrington  The two Princes of Poets may easily be proved to've been great Statesmen  Homer  particularly made choice of a Moral which in his Time when  Greece  with the Islands of the  Aegaean  was divided into petty Sovereignties was the fundamental Maxim of their Politicks and their true Interest which Moral was as  Sallust  afterwards express'd it  Concordiâ res parvae crescunt Discordiâ maxima dilabuntur  from whose noblest Poem you formerly gave us a Tragedy in which in Imitation of  Homer  you are daring yet just fiery yet regular sublime yet natural and perspicuous chast yet alluring and easie yet strong and powerful  But to come to the more active part of Government the greatest Monarchs and Captains and Ministers of State that ever were known in the World either were or would have been great Poets When  Athens  flourish'd in all her Glory their Poets and their famous Writers  were they who directed their Counsels and led their Armies to Battel  Alexander  read nothing but the Works of  Homer  while he conquer'd the Orient In  Rome  the greatest Captain that flourish'd in the Time of the Commonwealth vouchsafed his Assistance to a Comick Poet And the two first  Caesars  were proud to write Tragedies with those fatal Hands that were victorious over the Universe  Mecaenas  at the Time that he was first Minister to the Emperor of the World was not only the greatest Patron of the Muses that ever was but endeavour'd to be himself a Poet If we descend to Modern Times  Richlieu  who laid the Foundation of the  French  Greatness wrote more than one Dramatick Poem with that very right Hand which dictated to the Cabinets of so many Sovereign Princes and directed the successful Motions of so many conquering Commanders And that Greatness which upon a  French  Poetick Foundation was in the Space of less  than one Century rais'd to an insupportable Height was in less than twenty Years sapp'd and undermin'd and overturn'd by a  British  Poetick Ministry It being undeniable that several of the Persons who made the chief Figures in both the old and the new Ministry were Poets I make no doubt Sir but the Time will come when you will be distinguish'd by the Wisdom and Reach of your Counsels as much as you were formerly by the Spirit and Justness of your Writings For the very Vertues which we once were afraid would hinder your Advancement even in the most vertuous Court are now like to preserve and support your Interest since you have had an Opportunity of publickly practising them so long 'Tis impossible to behold that Ardor that Sincerity and that Alacrity with which you every Day endeavour to do good to your FellowCreatures without loving you and without wishing as well as hoping that you may be the peculiar Care of Providence  which by advancing you to one of the most eminent Stations would provide for Thousands But when we behold that Ardor and that Alacrity attended with such an attractive Sweetness and such a manly Grace and with a Nobility which God and Nature seem to have imprinted both on your Mind and Person we have no longer Power over our selves but give up all our Affections to you and not only wish but firmly believe that since God and Nature have given you those several Excellencies which were the undoubted Original of all Political Nobility they have determin'd you to succeed to the most extensive Fortunes and Titles of your Noble Ancestors which is warmly desir'd and earnestly expected by all who have the Honour to know you but more especially by  SIR  Your most oblig'd most humble and most faithful Servant JOHN DENNIS  LETTER I  On the Genius and Writings of  Shakespear  To Mr  Feb  SIR  I Here send you the Tragedy of  Coriolanus  which I have alter'd from the Original of  Shakespear  and with it a short Account of the Genius and Writings of that Author both which you desired me to send to you the last time I had the good Fortune to see you But I send them both upon this condition that you will with your usual Sincerity tell me your Sentiments both of the Poem and of the Criticism  Shakespear  was one of the greatest Genius's that the World e'er saw for the Tragick Stage Tho'he lay under greater Disadvantages  than any of his Successors yet had he greater and more genuine Beauties than the best and greatest of them And what makes the brightest Glory of his Character those Beauties were entirely his own and owing to the Force of his own Nature whereas his Faults were owing to his Education and to the Age that he liv'd in One may say of him as they did of  Homer  that he had none to imitate and is himself inimitable His Imaginations were often as just as they were bold and strong He had a natural Discretion which never cou'd have been taught him and his Judgment was strong and penetrating He seems to have wanted nothing but Time and Leisure for Thought to have found out those Rules of which he appears so ignorant His Characters are always drawn justly exactly graphically except where he fail'd by not knowing History or the Poetical Art He has for the most part more fairly distinguish'd them than any of his Successors have done who have falsified them or confounded them by making Love the predominant Quality in all He had so fine a Talent for touching the Passions and they are so lively in him and so truly in Nature that they often touch us more without their due Preparations than those of other Tragick Poets who have all the Beauty of Design and all the Advantage of  Incidents His MasterPassion was Terror which he has often mov'd so powerfully and so wonderfully that we may justly conclude that if he had had the Advantage of Art and Learning he wou'd have surpass'd the very best and strongest of the Ancients His Paintings are often so beautiful and so lively so graceful and so powerful especially where he uses them in order to move Terror that there is nothing perhaps more accomplish'd in our  English  Poetry His Sentiments for the most part in his best Tragedies are noble generous easie and natural and adapted to the Persons who use them His Expression is in many Places good and pure after a hundred Years simple tho' elevated graceful tho' bold and easy tho' strong He seems to have been the very Original of our  English  Tragical Harmony that is the Harmony of Blank Verse diversifyed often by Dissyllable and Trissyllable Terminations For that Diversity distinguishes it from Heroick Harmony and bringing it nearer to common Use makes it more proper to gain Attention and more fit for Action and Dialogue Such Verse we make when we are writing Prose we make such Verse in common Conversation  If  Shakespear  had these great Qualities by Nature what would he not have been if he had join'd to so happy a Genius Learning  and the Poetical Art For want of the latter our Author has sometimes made gross Mistakes in the Characters which he has drawn from History against the Equality and Conveniency of Manners of his Dramatical Persons Witness  Menenius  in the following Tragedy whom he has made an errant Buffoon which is a great Absurdity For he might as well have imagin'd a grave majestick  JackPudding  as a Buffoon in a  Roman  Senator  Aufidius  the General of the  Volscians  is shewn a base and a profligate Villain He has offended against the Equality of the Manners even in his Hero himself For  Coriolanus  who in the first part of the Tragedy is shewn so open so frank so violent and so magnanimous is represented in the latter part by  Aufidius  which is contradicted by no one a flattering fawning cringing insinuating Traytor  For want of this Poetical Art  Shakespear  has introduced things into his Tragedies which are against the Dignity of that noble Poem as the Rabble in  Julius Caesar  and that in  Coriolanus  tho' that in  Coriolanus  offends not only against the Dignity of Tragedy but against the Truth of History likewise and the Customs of Ancient  Rome  and the Majesty of the  Roman  People as we shall have occasion to shew anon  For want of this Art he has made his Incidents less moving less surprizing and less wonderful He has been so far from seeking those fine Occasions to move with which an Action furnish'd according to Art would have furnish'd him that he seems rather to have industriously avoided them He makes  Coriolanus  upon his Sentence of Banishment take his leave of his Wife and his Mother out of sight of the Audience and so has purposely as it were avoided a great occasion to move  If we are willing to allow that  Shakespear  by sticking to the bare Events of History has mov'd more than any of his Successors yet his just Admirers must confess that if he had had the Poetical Art he would have mov'd ten times more For 'tis impossible that by a bare Historical Play he could move so much as he would have done by a Fable  We find that a Romance entertains the generality of Mankind with more Satisfaction than History if they read only to be entertertain'd but if they read History thro' Pride or Ambition they bring their Passions along with them and that alters the case Nothing is more plain than that even in an Historical Relation some Parts of it and some Events please more than others And therefore a Man of Judgment who sees why they  do so may in forming a Fable and disposing an Action please more than an Historian can do For the just Fiction of a Fable moves us more than an Historical Relation can do for the two following Reasons First by reason of the Communication and mutual Dependence of its Parts For if Passion springs from Motion then the Obstruction of that Motion or a counter Motion must obstruct and check the Passion And therefore an Historian and a Writer of Historical Plays passing from Events of one nature to Events of another nature without a due Preparation must of necessity stifle and confound one Passion by another The second Reason why the Fiction of a Fable pleases us more than an Historical Relation can do is because in an Historical Relation we seldom are acquainted with the true Causes of Events whereas in a feign'd Action which is duly constituted that is which has a just beginning those Causes always appear For 'tis observable that both in a Poetical Fiction and an Historical Relation those Events are the most entertaining the most surprizing and the most wonderful in which Providence most plainly appears And 'tis for this Reason that the Author of a just Fable must please more than the Writer of an Historical Relation The Good must never fail to prosper and the Bad must be always  punish'd Otherwise the Incidents and particularly the Catastrophe which is the grand Incident are liable to be imputed rather to Chance than to Almighty Conduct and to Sovereign Justice The want of this impartial Distribution of Justice makes the  Coriolanus  of  Shakespear  to be without Moral 'Tis true indeed  Coriolanus  is kill'd by those Foreign Enemies with whom he had openly sided against his Country which seems to be an Event worthy of Providence and would look as if it were contriv'd by infinite Wisdom and executed by supreme Justice to make  Coriolanus  a dreadful Example to all who lead on Foreign Enemies to the Invasion of their native Country if there were not something in the Fate of the other Characters which gives occasion to doubt of it and which suggests to the Sceptical Reader that this might happen by accident For  Aufidius  the principal Murderer of  Coriolanus  who in cold Blood gets him assassinated by Ruffians instead of leaving him to the Law of the Country and the Justice of the  Volscian  Senate and who commits so black a Crime not by any erroneous Zeal or a mistaken Publick Spirit but thro' Jealousy Envy and inveterate Malice this Assassinator not only survives and survives unpunish'd but seems to be rewarded for so detestable an Action by engrossing all those  Honours to himself which  Coriolanus  before had shar'd with him But not only  Aufidius  but the  Roman  Tribunes  Sicinius  and  Brutus  appear to me to cry aloud for Poetick Vengeance For they are guilty of two Faults neither of which ought to go unpunish'd The first in procuring the Banishment of  Coriolanus  If they were really jealous that  Coriolanus  had a Design on their Liberties when he stood for the Consulship it was but just that they should give him a Repulse but to get the Champion and Defender of their Country banish'd upon a pretended Jealousy was a great deal too much and could proceed from nothing but that Hatred and Malice which they had conceiv'd against him for opposing their Institution Their second Fault lay in procuring this Sentence by indirect Methods by exasperating and inflaming the People by Artifices and Insinuations by taking a base Advantage of the Openheartedness and Violence of  Coriolanus  and by oppressing him with a Sophistical Argument that he aim'd at Sovereignty because he had not deliver'd into the Publick Treasury the Spoils which he had taken from the  Antiates  As if a Design of Sovereignty could be reasonably concluded from any one Act or any one could think of bringing to pass such a Design by eternally favouring the Patricians and disobliging  the Populace For we need make no doubt but that it was among the young Patricians that  Coriolanus  distributed the Spoils which were taken from the  Antiates  whereas nothing but caressing the Populace could enslave the  Roman  People as  Caesar  afterwards very well saw and experienc'd So that this Injustice of the Tribunes was the original Cause of the Calamity which afterwards befel their Country by the Invasion of the  Volscians  under the Conduct of  Coriolanus  And yet these Tribunes at the end of the Play like  Aufidius  remain unpunish'd But indeed  Shakespear  has been wanting in the exact Distribution of Poetical Justice not only in his  Coriolanus  but in most of his best Tragedies in which the Guilty and the Innocent perish promiscuously as  Duncan  and  Banquo  in  Mackbeth  as likewise Lady  Macduffe  and her Children  Desdemona  in  Othello    Cordelia    Kent  and King  Lear  in the Tragedy that bears his Name  Brutus  and  Porcia  in  Julius Caesar  and young  Hamlet  in the Tragedy of  Hamlet  For tho' it may be said in Defence of the last that  Hamlet  had a Design to kill his Uncle who then reign'd yet this is justify'd by no less than a Call from Heaven and raising up one from the Dead to urge him to it The Good and the Bad then perishing promiscuously in the best of  Shakespear  's Tragedies there can be either  none or very weak Instruction in them For such promiscuous Events call the Government of Providence into Question and by Scepticks and Libertines are resolv'd into Chance I humbly conceive therefore that this want of Dramatical Justice in the Tragedy of  Coriolanus  gave occasion for a just Alteration and that I was oblig'd to sacrifice to that Justice  Aufidius  and the Tribunes as well as  Coriolanus  Thus have we endeavour'd to shew that for want of the Poetical Art  Shakespear  lay under very great Disadvantages At the same time we must own to his Honour that he has often perform'd Wonders without it in spight of the Judgment of so great a Man as  Horace  Naturâ fieret Laudabile carmen an arte  Quaesitum est ego nec studium sine Divite vena  Nec rude quid profit video Ingenium alterius sic  Altera poscit opem res conjurat amicè  But from this very Judgment of  Horace  we may justly conclude that  Shakespear  would have wonderfully surpass'd himself if Art had been join'd to Nature There never was a greater Genius in the World than  Virgil  He was one who seems to have been born for this glorious End that the  Roman  Muse might exert in him the utmost Force of her  Poetry And his admirable and divine Beauties are manifestly owing to the happy Confederacy of Art and Nature It was Art that contriv'd that incomparable Design of the  Aeneis  and it was Nature that executed it Could the greatest Genius that ever was infus'd into Earthly Mold by Heaven if it had been unguided and unassisted by Art have taught him to make that noble and wonderful Use of the  Pythagorean  Transmigration which he makes in the Sixth Book of his Poem Had  Virgil  been a circular Poet and closely adher'd to History how could the  Romans  have been transported with that inimitable Episode of  Dido  which brought afresh into their Minds the  Carthaginian  War and the dreadful  Hannibal  When 'tis evident that that admirable Episode is so little owing to a faithful observance of History and the exact order of Time that 'tis deriv'd from a very bold but judicious Violation of these it being undeniable that  Dido  liv'd almost Years after  Aeneas  Yet is it that charming Episode that makes the chief Beauties of a third Part of the Poem For the Destruction of  Troy  it self which is so divinely related is still more admirable by the Effect it produces which is the Passion of  Dido  I should now proceed to shew under what Disadvantages  Shakespear  lay for want of  being conversant with the Ancients But I have already writ a long Letter and am desirous to know how you relish what has been already said before I go any farther For I am unwilling to take more Pains before I am sure of giving you some Pleasure I am  SIR  Your most Humble Faithful Servant  LETTER II  On the Genius and Writings of  Shakespear  To Mr  Feb  SIR  UPON the Encouragement I have receiv'd from you I shall proceed to shew under what Disadvantages  Shakespear  lay for want of being conversant with the Ancients But because I have lately been in some Conversation where they would not allow but that he was acquainted with the Ancients I shall endeavour to make it appear that he was not and the shewing that in the Method in which I pretend to convince the Reader of it will sufficiently prove what Inconveniences he lay under and what Errors he committed for want of being conversant with them But here we must distinguish between the several kinds of Acquaintance A Man may be said to be acquainted with another who never was but twice in his Company but that is at the best a superficial Acquaintance from which neither very great Pleasure nor Profit can be deriv'd Our business is here to  shew that  Shakespear  had no familiar Acquaintance with the  Graecian  and  Roman  Authors For if he was familiarly conversant with them how comes it to pass that he wants Art Is it that he studied to know them in other things and neglected that only in them which chiefly tends to the Advancement of the Art of the Stage Or is it that he wanted Discernment to see the Justness and the Greatness and the Harmony of their Designs and the Reasonableness of those Rules upon which those Designs are founded Or how come his Successors to have that Discernment which he wanted when they fall so much below him in other things How comes he to have been guilty of the grossest faults in Chronology and how come we to find out those faults In his Tragedy of  Troylus  and  Cressida  he introduces  Hector  speaking of  Aristotle  who was born a thousand Years after the Death of  Hector  In the same Play mention is made of  Milo  which is another very great fault in Chronology  Alexander  is mention'd in  Coriolanus  tho' that Conqueror of the Orient liv'd above Two hundred Years after him In this last Tragedy he has mistaken the very Names of his Dramatick Persons if we give Credit to  Livy  For the Mother of  Coriolanus  in the  Roman  Historian is  Vetturia  and the Wife is  Volumnia  Whereas in  Shakespear  the Wife is  Virgilia  and the Mother  Volumnia  And the  Volscian  General in  Shakespear  is  Tullus Aufidius  and  Tullus Attius  in  Livy  How comes it that he takes  Plutarch  's Word who was by Birth a  Graecian  for the Affairs of  Rome  rather than that of the  Roman  Historian if so be that he had read the Latter Or what Reason can be given for his not reading him when he wrote upon a  Roman  Story but that in  Shakespear  's Time there was a Translation of  Plutarch  and there was none of  Livy  If  Shakespear  was familiarly conversant with the  Roman  Authors how came he to introduce a Rabble into  Coriolanus  in which he offended not only against the Dignity of Tragedy but the Truth of Fact the Authority of all the  Roman  Writers the Customs of Ancient  Rome  and the Majesty of the  Roman  People By introducing a Rabble into  Julius Caesar  he only offended against the Dignity of Tragedy For that part of the People who ran about the Streets upon great Festivals or publick Calamities or publick Rejoicings or Revolutions in Government are certainly the Scum of the Populace But the Persons who in the Time of  Coriolanus  rose in Vindication of their just Rights and extorted from the Patricians the Institution of the Tribunes of the People and the Persons by whom afterwards  Coriolanus  was  tried were the whole Body of the  Roman  People to the Reserve of the Patricians which Body included the  Roman  Knights and the wealthy substantial Citizens who were as different from the Rabble as the Patricians themselves as qualify'd as the latter to form a right Judgment of Things and to contemn the vain Opinions of the Rabble So at least  Horace  esteems them who very well knew his Countrymen  Offenduntur enim quibus est equus aut pater aut res  Nec siquid fricti ciceris probat aut nucis emptor  Aequis accipiant animis donantve Corona  Where we see the Knights and the substantial Citizens are rank'd in an equal Degree of Capacity with the  Roman  Senators and are equally distinguish'd from the Rabble  If  Shakespear  was so conversant with the Ancients how comes he to have introduc'd some Characters into his Plays so unlike what they are to be found in History In the Character of  Menenius  in the following Tragedy he has doubly offended against that Historical Resemblance For first whereas  Menenius  was an eloquent Person  Shakespear  has made him a downright Buffoon And how is it possible for any Man to conceive a  Ciceronian Jackpudding  Never was  any Buffoon eloquent or wise or witty or vertuous All the good and ill Qualities of a Buffoon are summ'd up in one word and that is a Buffoon And secondly whereas  Shakespear  has made him a Hater and Contemner and Vilifyer of the People we are assur'd by the  Roman  Historian that  Menenius  was extremely popular He was so very far from opposing the Institution of the Tribunes as he is represented in  Shakespear  that he was chiefly instrumental in it After the People had deserted the City and sat down upon the sacred Mountain he was the chief of the Delegates whom the Senate deputed to them as being look'd upon to be the Person who would be most agreable to them In short this very  Menenius  both liv'd and dy'd so very much their Favourite that dying poor he had pompous Funerals at the Expence of the  Roman  People  Had  Shakespear  read either  Salust  or  Cicero  how could he have made so very little of the first and greatest of Men as that  Caesar  should be but a Fourthrate Actor in his own Tragedy How could it have been that seeing  Caesar  we should ask for  Caesar  That we should ask where is his unequall'd Greatness of Mind his unbounded Thirst of Glory and that victorious Eloquence with which he triumph'd over the Souls  of both Friends and Enemies and with which he rivall'd  Cicero  in Genius as he did  Pompey  in Power How fair an Occasion was there to open the Character of  Caesar  in the first Scene between  Brutus  and  Cassius  For when  Cassius  tells  Brutus  that  Caesar  was but a Man like them and had the same natural Imperfections which they had how natural had it been for  Brutus  to reply that  Caesar  indeed had their Imperfections of Nature but neither he nor  Cassius  had by any means the great Qualities of  Caesar  Neither his Military Vertue nor Science nor his matchless Renown nor his unparallell'd Victories his unwearied Bounty to his Friends nor his Godlike Clemency to his Foes his Beneficence his Munificence his Easiness of Access to the meanest  Roman  his indefatigable Labours his incredible Celerity the Plausibleness if not Justness of his Ambition that knowing himself to be the greatest of Men he only sought occasion to make the World confess him such In short if  Brutus  after enumerating all the wonderful Qualities of  Caesar  had resolv'd in spight of them all to sacrifice him to publick Liberty how had such a Proceeding heighten'd the Vertue and the Character of  Brutus  But then indeed it would have been requisite that  Caesar  upon his appearance should have made  all this good And as we know no Principle of human Action but human Sentiment only  Caesar  who did greater Things and had greater Designs than the rest of the  Romans  ought certainly to have outshin'd by many Degrees all the other Characters of his Tragedy  Caesar  ought particularly to have justified his Actions and to have heighten'd his Character by shewing that what he had done he had done by Necessity that the  Romans  had lost their  Agrarian  lost their Rotation of Magistracy and that consequently nothing but an empty Shadow of publick Liberty remain'd That the  Gracchi  had made the last noble but unsuccessful Efforts for the restoring the Commonwealth that they had fail'd for want of arbitrary irresistible Power the Restoration of the  Agrarian  requiring too vast a Retrospect to be done without it that the Government when  Caesar  came to publick Affairs was got into the Hands of a few and that those few were factious and were contending among themselves and if you will pardon so mean an Expression scrambling as it were for Power That  Caesar  was reduc'd to the Necessity of ruling or himself obeying a Master and that apprehending that another would exercise the supreme Command without that Clemency and Moderation which he did he had rather chosen  to rule than to obey So that  Caesar  was faulty not so much in seizing upon the Sovereignty which was become in a manner necessary as in not reestablishing the Commonwealth by restoring the  Agrarian  and the Rotation of Magistracies after he had got absolute and uncontroulable Power And if  Caesar  had seiz'd upon the Sovereignty only with a View of reestablishing Liberty he had surpass'd all Mortals in Godlike Goodness as much as he did in the rest of his astonishing Qualities I must confess I do not remember that we have any Authority from the  Roman  Historians which may induce us to believe that  Caesar  had any such Design Nor if he had had any such View could he who was the most secret the most prudent and the most discerning of Men have discover'd it before his  Parthian  Expedition was over for fear of utterly disobliging his Veterans And  Caesar  believ'd that Expedition necessary for the Honour and Interest of the State and for his own Glory  But of this we may be sure that two of the most discerning of all the  Romans  and who had the deepest Insight into the Soul of  Caesar    Salust  and  Cicero  were not without Hopes that  Caesar  would really reestablish Liberty or else they would not have attack'd him upon it the one in his Oration  for  Marcus Marcellus  the other in the Second Part of that little Treatise  De Republicâ ordinandâ  which is address'd to  Caesar Haec igitur tibi reliqua pars  says  Cicero    Hic restat Actus in hoc elaborandum est ut Rempublicam constituas eâ{que} tu in primis compositâ summa Tranquillitate otio perfruare Cicero  therefore was not without Hope that  Caesar  would reestablish the Commonwealth and any one who attentively peruses that Oration of  Cicero  will find that that Hope was reasonably grounded upon his knowledge of the great Qualities of  Caesar  his Clemency his Beneficence his admirable Discernment and that avoidless Ruine in which the whole Empire would be soon involv'd if  Caesar  did not effect this  Salust  urges it still more home to him and with greater vehemence he has recourse to every Motive that may be thought to be powerful over so great a Soul He exhorts him by the Memory of his matchless Conquests not to suffer the invincible Empire of the  Roman  People to be devour'd by Time or to be torn in pieces by Discord one of which would soon and infallibly happen if Liberty was not restor'd  He introduces his Country and his Progenitors urging him in a noble Prosopopeia by all the mighty Benefits which they had  conferr'd upon him with so little Pains of his own not to deny them that just and easy Request of the Restoration of Liberty He adjures him by those Furies which will eternally haunt his Soul upon his impious Refusal He implores him by the foresight of those dismal Calamities that horrible Slaughter those endless Wars and that unbounded Devastation which will certainly fall upon Mankind if the Restoration of Liberty is prevented by his Death or his incurable Sickness And lastly he entreats him by his Thirst of immortal Glory that Glory in which he now has Rivals if he has not Equals but which if he reestablishes Liberty will be acknowledg'd by consenting Nations to have neither Equal nor Second  I am apt to believe that if  Shakespear  had been acquainted with all this we had had from him quite another Character of  Caesar  than that which we now find in him He might then have given us a Scene something like that which  Corneille  has so happily us'd in his  Cinna  something like that which really happen'd between  Augustus    Mecaenas  and  Agrippa  He might then have introduc'd  Caesar  consulting  Cicero  on the one side and on the other  Anthony  whether he should retain that absolute Sovereignty which he had acquir'd by his Victory or  whether he should reestablish and immortalize Liberty That would have been a Scene which might have employ'd the finest Art and the utmost force of a Writer That had been a Scene in which all the great Qualities of  Caesar  might have been display'd I will not pretend to determine here how that Scene might have been turn'd and what I have already said on this Subject has been spoke with the utmost Caution and Diffidence But this I will venture to say that if that Scene had been manag'd so as by the powerful Motives employ'd in it to have shaken the Soul of  Caesar  and to have left room for the least Hope for the least Doubt that  Caesar  would have reestablish'd Liberty after his  Parthian  Expedition and if this Conversation had been kept secret till the Death of  Caesar  and then had been discover'd by  Anthony  then had  Caesar  fall'n so belov'd and lamented by the  Roman  People so pitied and so bewail'd even by the Conspirators themselves as never Man fell Then there would have been a Catastrophe the most dreadful and the most deplorable that ever was beheld upon the Tragick Stage Then had we seen the noblest of the Conspirators cursing their temerarious Act and the most apprehensive of them in dreadful expectation of those horrible Calamities which fell upon  the  Romans  after the Death of  Caesar  But Sir when I write this to you I write it with the utmost Deference to the extraordinary Judgment of that great Man who some Years ago I hear alter'd the  Julius Caesar  And I make no doubt but that his fine Discernment and the rest of his great Qualities have amply supply'd the Defects which are found in the Character of  Shakespear  's  Caesar  I should here answer an Argument by which some People pretend to prove and especially those with whom I lately convers'd that  Shakespear  was conversant with the Ancients But besides that the Post is about to be gone I am heartily tir'd with what I have already writ and so doubtless are you I shall therefore defer the rest to the next opportunity and remain  Your  c  LETTER III  On the Writings and Genius of  Shakespear  To Mr  Feb  SIR  I Come now to the main Argument which some People urge to prove that  Shakespear  was conversant with the Ancients For there is say they among  Shakespear  's Plays one call'd  The Comedy of Errors  which is undeniably an Imitation of the  Menechmi  of  Plautus  Now  Shakespear  say they being conversant with  Plautus  it undeniably follows that he was acquainted with the Ancients because no  Roman  Author could be hard to him who had conquer'd  Plautus  To which I answer that the Errors which we have mention'd above are to be accounted for no other way but by the want of knowing the Ancients or by downright want of Capacity But nothing can be more absurd or more unjust than to impute it to want of Capacity For the very Sentiments of  Shakespear  alone are sufficient to shew that he had a great Understanding And therefore we must account some other way  for his Imitation of the  Menechmi  I remember to have seen among the Translations of  Ovid  's Epistles printed by Mr  Tonson  an Imitation of that from  Oenone  to  Paris  which Mr  Dryden  tells us in his Preface to those Epistles was imitated by one of the Fair Sex who understood no Latin but that she had done enough to make those blush who understood it the best There are at this day several Translators who as  Hudibrass  has it  Translate from Languages of which  They understand no part of Speech  I will not affirm that of  Shakespear  I believe he was able to do what Pedants call construe but that he was able to read  Plautus  without Pain and Difficulty I can never believe Now I appeal to you Sir what time he had between his Writing and his Acting to read any thing that could not be read with Ease and Pleasure We see that our Adversaries themselves acknowledge that if  Shakespear  was able to read  Plautus  with Ease nothing in Latinity could be hard to him How comes it to pass then that he has given us no Proofs of his familiar Acquaintance with the Ancients but this Imitation of the  Menechmi  and a Version of two Epistles of  Ovid  How comes  it that he had never read  Horace  of a superiour Merit to either and particularly his Epistle to the  Piso's  which so much concern'd his Art Or if he had read that Epistle how comes it that in his  Troylus  and  Cressida  we must observe by the way that when  Shakespear  wrote that Play  Ben Johnson  had not as yet translated that Epistle he runs counter to the Instructions which  Horace  has given for the forming the Character of  Achilles  Scriptor Honoratum si forte reponis Achillem  Impiger Iracundus Inexorablis Acer  Jura neget sibi nata  Where is the  Impiger  the  Iracundus  or the  Acer  in the Character of  Shakespear  's  Achilles  Who is nothing but a drolling lazy conceited overlooking Coxcomb so far from being the honour'd  Achilles  the Epithet that  Homer  and  Horace  after him give him that he is deservedly the Scorn and the Jest of the rest of the Characters even to that Buffoon  Thersites  Tho'  Shakespear  succeeded very well in Comedy yet his principal Talent and his chief Delight was Tragedy If then  Shakespear  was qualify'd to read  Plautus  with Ease he could read with a great deal more Ease the Translations of  Sophocles  and  Euripides  And tho' by these Translations he would not have been able to have seen the charming colouring of those great Masters yet would he have seen all the Harmony and the Beauty of their great and their just Designs He would have seen enough to have stirr'd up a noble Emulation in so exalted a Soul as his How comes it then that we hear nothing from him of the  Oedipus  the  Electra  the  Antigone  of  Sophocles  of the  Iphigenia  's the  Orestes  the  Medea  the  Hecuba  of  Euripides  How comes it that we see nothing in the Conduct of his Pieces that shews us that he had the least Acquaintance with any of these great Masterpieces Did  Shakespear  appear to be so nearly touch'd with the Affliction of  Hecuba  for the Death of  Priam  which was but daub'd and bungled by one of his Countrymen that he could not forbear introducing it as it were by Violence into his own  Hamlet  and would he make no Imitation no Commendation not the least mention of the unparallell'd and inimitable Grief of the  Hecuba  of  Euripides  How comes it that we find no Imitation of any ancient Play in this but the  Menechmi  of  Plautus  How came he to chuse a Comick preferably to the Tragick Poets Or how comes he to chuse  Plautus  preferably to  Terence  who is so much more just more graceful more  regular and more natural Or how comes he to chuse the  Menechmi  of  Plautus  which is by no means his Masterpiece before all his other Comedies I vehemently suspect that this Imitation of the  Menechmi  was either from a printed Translation of that Comedy which is lost or some Version in Manuscript brought him by a Friend or sent him perhaps by a Stranger or from the original Play it self recommended to him and read to him by some learned Friend In short I had rather account for this by what is not absurd than by what is or by a less Absurdity than by a greater For nothing can be more wrong than to conclude from this that  Shakespear  was conversant with the Ancients which contradicts the Testimony of his Contemporary and his familiar Acquaintance  Ben Johnson  and of his Successor  Milton    Lo  Shakespear  Fancy's sweetest Child  Warbles his native Woodnotes wild  And of Mr  Dryden  after them both and which destroys the most glorious Part of  Shakespear  's Merit immediately For how can he be esteem'd equal by Nature or superior to the Ancients when he falls so far short of them in Art tho' he had the Advantage of knowing all that they did before  him Nay it debases him below those of common Capacity by reason of the Errors which we mention'd above Therefore he who allows that  Shakespear  had Learning and a familiar Acquaintance with the Ancients ought to be look'd upon as a Detractor from his extraordinary Merit and from the Glory of  Great Britain  For whether is it more honourable for this Island to have produc'd a Man who without having any Acquaintance with the Ancients or any but a slender and a superficial one appears to be their Equal or their Superior by the Force of Genius and Nature or to have bred one who knowing the Ancients falls infinitely short of them in Art and consequently in Nature it self  Great Britain  has but little Reason to boast of its Natives Education since the same that they had here they might have had in another place But it may justly claim a very great share in their Nature and Genius since these depend in a great measure on the Climate and therefore  Horace  in the Instruction which he gives for the forming the Characters advises the noble  Romans  for whose Instruction he chiefly writes to consider whether the Dramatick Person whom they introduce is  Colchus an Assyrius Thebis nutritus an Argis  Thus Sir I have endeavour'd to shew under what great Disadvantages  Shakespear  lay for want of the Poetical Art and for want of being conversant with the Ancients  But besides this he lay under other very great Inconveniencies For he was neither Master of Time enough to consider correct and polish what he wrote to alter it to add to it and to retrench from it nor had he Friends to consult upon whose Capacity and Integrity he could depend And tho' a Person of very good Judgment may succeed very well without consulting his Friends if he takes time enough to correct what he writes yet even the greatest Man that Nature and Art can conspire to accomplish can never attain to Perfection without either employing a great deal of time or taking the Advice of judicious Friends Nay 'tis the Opinion of  Horace  that he ought to do both  Siquid tamen olim  Scripseris in Metii descendat Judicis aures  Et Patris nostras nonum{que} prematur in Annum  Now we know very well that  Shakespear  was an Actor at a Time when there were  seven or eight Companies of Players in the Town together who each of them did their utmost Endeavours to get the Audiences from the rest and consequently that our Author was perpetually call'd upon by those who had the Direction and Management of the Company to which he belong'd for new Pieces which might be able to support them and give them some Advantage over the rest And 'tis easy to judge what time he was Master of between his laborious Employment of Acting and his continual Hurry of Writing As for Friends they whom in all likelihood  Shakespear  consulted most were two or three of his FellowActors because they had the Care of publishing his Works committed to them Now they as we are told by  Ben Johnson  in his Discoveries were extremely pleas'd with their Friend for scarce ever making a Blot and were very angry with  Ben  for saying he wish'd that he had made a thousand The Misfortune of it is that  Horace  was perfectly of  Ben  's mind  Vos O  Pompilius sanguis carmen reprehendite quod non  Multa dies multa litura coercuit at{que}  Praesectum decies non castigavit ad unguem  And so was my Lord  Roscommon  Poets lose half the Praise they should have got  Could it be known what they discreetly blot  These Friends then of  Shakespear  were not qualify'd to advise him As for  Ben Johnson  besides that  Shakespear  began to know him late and that  Ben  was not the most communicative Person in the World of the Secrets of his Art he seems to me to have had no right Notion of Tragedy Nay so far from it that he who was indeed a very great Man and who has writ Comedies by which he has born away the Prize of Comedy both from Ancients and Moderns and been an Honour to  Great Britain  and who has done this without any Rules to guide him except what his own incomparable Talent dictated to him This extraordinary Man has err'd so grossly in Tragedy of which there were not only stated Rules but Rules which he himself had often read and had even translated that he has chosen two Subjects which according to those very Rules were utterly incapable of exciting either Compassion or Terror for the principal Characters which yet are the chief Passions that a Tragick Poet ought to endeavour to excite So that  Shakespear  having neither had Time to correct nor  Friends to consult must necessarily have frequently left such faults in his Writings for the Correction of which either a great deal of Time or a judicious and a well natur'd Friend is indispensably necessary  Vir bonus prudens versus reprehendet inertes  Culpabit duros incomptis allinet Atrum  Transverso calamo signum ambitiosa recidet  Ornamenta parum claris lucem dare coget  Arguet ambigue dictum metanda notabit  There is more than one Example of every kind of these Faults in the Tragedies of  Shakespear  and even in the  Coriolanus  There are Lines that are utterly void of that celestial Fire of which  Shakespear  is sometimes Master in so great a Degree And consequently there are Lines that are stiff and forc'd and harsh and unmusical tho'  Shakespear  had naturally an admirable Ear for the Numbers But no Man ever was very musical who did not write with Fire and no Man can always write with Fire unless he is so far Master of his Time as to expect those Hours when his Spirits are warm and volatile  Shakespear  must therefore sometimes have Lines which are neither strong nor graceful For who  ever had Force or Grace that had not Spirit There are in his  Coriolanus  among a great many natural and admirable Beauties three or four of those Ornaments which  Horace  would term ambitious and which we in  English  are apt to call Fustian or Bombast There are Lines in some Places which are very obscure and whole Scenes which ought to be alter'd  I have Sir employ'd some Time and Pains and that little Judgment which I have acquir'd in these Matters by a long and a faithful reading both of Ancients and Moderns in adding retrenching and altering several Things in the  Coriolanus  of  Shakespear  but with what Success I must leave to be determin'd by you I know very well that you will be surpriz'd to find that after all that I have said in the former part of this Letter against  Shakespear  's introducing the Rabble into  Coriolanus  I have not only retain'd in the second Act of the following Tragedy the Rabble which is in the Original but deviated more from the  Roman  Customs than  Shakespear  had done before me I desire you to look upon it as a voluntary Fault and a Trespass against Conviction 'Tis one of those Things which are  ad Populum Phalerae  and by no means inserted to please such Men as you  Thus Sir have I laid before you a short but impartial Account of the Beauties and Defects of  Shakespear  with an Intention to make these Letters publick if they are approv'd by you to teach some People to distinguish between his Beauties and his Defects that while they imitate the one they may with Caution avoid the other there being nothing of more dangerous Contagion to Writers and especially to young ones than the Faults of great Masters and while with  Milton  they applaud the great Qualities which  Shakespear  had by Nature they may follow his wise Example and form themselves as he assures us that he himself did upon the Rules and Writings of the Ancients  Sir if so candid and able a Judge as your+self shall happen to approve of this Essay in the main and to excuse and correct my Errors that Indulgence and that Correction will not only encourage me to make these Letters publick but will enable me to bear the Reproach of those who would fix a Brand even upon the justest Criticism as the Effect of Envy and ill Nature as if there could possibly be any ill Nature in the doing Justice or in the endeavouring to advance a very noble and a very useful Art and consequently to prove beneficent to Mankind As for those who may accuse  me of the want of a due Veneration for the Merit of an Author of so establish'd a Reputation as  Shakespear  I shall beg leave to tell them that they chuse the wrongest time that they could possibly take for such an Accusation as that For I appeal to you Sir who shews most Veneration for the Memory of  Shakespear  he who loves and admires his Charms and makes of them one of his chief Delights who sees him and reads him over and over and still remains unsatiated and who mentions his Faults for no other Reason but to make his Excellency the more conspicuous or he who pretending to be his blind Admirer shews in Effect the utmost Contempt for him preferring empty effeminate Sound to his solid Beauties and manly Graces and deserting him every Night for an execrable  Italian  Ballad so vile that a Boy who should write such lamentable Dogrel would be turn'd out of  Westminster  School for a desperate Blockhead too stupid to be corrected and amended by the harshest Discipline of the Place I am  SIR  Yours  c  To the SPECTATOR upon his Paper on the th of  April  YOU know Mr  Spectator  that Esquire  Bickerstaff  attack'd the Sharpers with Success but  Shadwell  is of Opinion that your Bully with his Box and his false Dice is an honester Fellow than the Rhetorical Author who makes use of his Tropes and Figures which are his High and his Lowrunners to cheat us at once of our Money and of our Intellectuals  I would not have you think Mr  Spectator  that this Reflection is directed to you 'Tis only intended against one or two of your Correspondents and particularly the  InnsofCourt  man who as you told us in your Second Paper supplies you with most of your Criticism who seems to me so little to understand the Province that he has undertaken that you would do well to advise him to do by you as he has done by his Father and make a Bargain in the gross with some honest Fellow to answer all your Occasions Which wholesome Advice if he proves too obstinate or too proud to take I am confident  at least that he is too gallant a Person to take it ill if once a Week or once a Fortnight I should shew so much Presumption as to cause a Writ of Error to be issued out to reverse his  Temple  Judgment  I cannot wonder that Criticism should degenerate so vilely at a time when Poetry and Acting are sunk so low For as  Hobbes  has observ'd that as often as Reason is against a Man a Man will be against Reason so as often as the Rules are against an Author an Author will be against the Rules Men first write foolish ridiculous Tragedies which shock all the Rules of Reason and Philosophy and then they make foolish extravagant Rules to fit those foolish Plays 'Tis impossible that your Gentleman of the InnsofCourt could have sent you so much wrong Sense as there is in your Paper of the  th  if he had not formerly writ an absurd Tragedy There are as many Bulls and Blunders and Contradictions in it almost as there are Lines and all deliver'd with that insolent and that blust'ring Air which usually attends upon Error and Delusion while Truth like the Deity that inspires it comes calmly and without noise  To set a few of his Errors in their proper Light he tells us in the beginning of that Paper  That the English Writers of  Tragedy are possess'd with a Notion that when they represent a vertuous or innocent Person in Distress they ought not to leave him 'till they have deliver'd him out of his Trouble and made him triumph over his Enemies  But Mr  Spectator  is this peculiar to the  English  Writers of Tragedy  Have not the  French  Writers of Tragedy the same Notion Does not  Racine  tell us in the Preface to his  Iphigenia  that it would have been horrible to have defil'd the Stage with the Murther of a Princess so virtuous and so lovely as was  Iphigenia  But your Correspondent goes on  This Error  says he with an insolent and dogmatick Air  they have been led into by a ridiculous Doctrine in modern Criticism that they are oblig'd to an equal Distribution of Rewards and Punishments and an impartial Execution of poetical Justice  But who were the first who establish'd this Rule he is not able to tell I take it for granted that a Man who is ingenuous enough to own his Ignorance is willing to be instructed Let me tell him then that the first who establish'd this ridiculous Doctrine of modern Criticism was a certain modern Critick who liv'd above two thousand Years ago and who tells us expresly in the thirteenth Chapter of his critical  Spectator  which Pedants call his Poetick  That since a Tragedy to have all the Beauty of which it is capable ought to be Implex and not Simple  by the way Mr  Spectator  you must bear with this critical Cant as we do with your Speculations and Lucubrations  and ought to move Compassion and Terror for we have already shewn that the exciting these Passions is the proper Effect of a tragical Imitation it follows necessarily that we must not choose a very good Man to plunge him from a prosperous Condition into Adversity for instead of moving Compassion and Terrour that on the contrary would create Horrour and be detested by all the World  And does not the same deluded Philosopher tell us in the very same Chapter that the Fable to which he gives the second Preference is that which has a double Constitution and which ends by a double Catastrophe a Catastrophe favourable to the Good and fatal to the Wicked Is not here Mr  Spectator  a very formal Recommendation of the impartial and exact Execution of poetical Justice Thus  Aristotle  was the first who establish'd this ridiculous Doctrine of modern Criticism but Mr  Rymer  was the first who introduc'd it into our native Language who notwithstanding the Rage of all the Poetasters of the Times whom he has exasperated by opening the Eyes of the Blind that they  may see their Errors will always pass with impartial Posterity for a most learned a most judicious and a most useful Critick Now is not your Correspondent a profound and a learned Person and ought he not to own himself oblig'd to me for this notable piece of Erudition  But he goes on in his dictatorian way  This Rule  says he  whoever establish'd it has I am sure no Foundation in Nature in Reason and in the Practice of the Ancients  But what will this dogmatick Person say now when we shew him that this contemptible Doctrine of poetical Justice is not only founded in Reason and Nature but is it self the Foundation of all the Rules and ev'n of Tragedy itself For what Tragedy can there be without a Fable or what Fable without a Moral or what Moral without poetical Justice What Moral where the Good and the Bad are confounded by Destiny and perish alike promiscuously Thus we see this Doctrine of poetical Justice is more founded in Reason and Nature than all the rest of the poetical Rules together For what can be more natural and more highly reasonable than to employ that Rule in Tragedy without which that Poem cannot exist Well but the Practice of the Ancients is against this poetical Justice What always Mr  Spectator  will your Correspondent have the Assurance to affirm that No but sometimes Why then sometimes the Ancients offended against Reason and Nature And who ever believ'd that the Ancients were without Fault or brought Tragedy to its Perfection But I shall take another Opportunity to shew that the Practice of the Ancients in all their Masterpieces is exactly according to this fundamental Rule I have not time to do that in this short Letter because that would necessarily oblige me to shew that poetical Justice is of a much larger Extent than this profound Critick imagines but yet I shall give the discerning Reader a hint of it in that which follows  Poetical Justice  says your Correspondent  has no Foundation in Nature and Reason because we find that good and evil happen alike to all Men on this side the Grave  In answer to which he must give me leave to tell him that this is not only a very false but a very dangerous Assertion that we neither know what Men really are nor what they really suffer  'Tis not always that we know Men's Crimes but how seldom do we know their Passions and especially their darling Passions And as Passion is the Occasion of infinitely more Disorder in the World than Malice for where one Man falls a Sacrifice to inveterate Malice  a thousand become Victims to Revenge and Ambition and whereas Malice has something that shocks human Nature Passion is pleasingly catching and contagious Can any thing be more just than that that Providence which governs the World should punish Men for indulging their Passions as much as for obeying the Dictates of their most envenom'd Hatred and Malice  Thus you see for ought we know Good and Evil does not happen alike to all Men on this side the Grave Because 'tis for the most part by their Passions that Men offend and 'tis by their Passions for the most part that they are punish'd But this is certain that the more Virtue a Man has the more he commands his Passions but the Virtuous alone command them The Wicked take the utmost Care to dissemble and conceal them for which reason we neither know what our Neighbours are nor what they really suffer Man is too finite too shallow and too empty a Creature to know another Man throughly to know the Creature of an infinite Creator but dramatical Persons are Creatures of which a Poet is himself the Creator And tho' a Mortal is not able to know the Almighty's Creatures he may be allow'd to know his own to know the utmost Extent of their Guilt and what they ought to suffer  nay he must be allow'd not only to know this himself but to make it manifest and unquestionable to all his Readers and Hearers The Creatures of a poetical Creator have no Dissimulation and no Reserve We see their Passions in all their height and in all their Deformity and when they are unfortunate we are never to seek for the Cause  But suppose I should grant that there is not always an equal Distribution of Affliction and Happiness here below Man is a Creature who was created immortal and a Creature consequently that will find a Compensation in Futurity for any seeming Inequality in his Dealing here But the Creatures of a poetical Creator are imaginary and transitory they have no longer Duration than the Representation of their respective Fables and consequently if they offend they must be punish'd during that Representation And therefore we are very far from pretending that poetical Justice is an equal Representation of the Justice of the Almighty  We freely confess that 'tis but a very narrow and a very imperfect Type of it so very narrow and so very imperfect that 'tis forc'd by temporal to represent eternal Punishments and therefore when we shew a Man unfortunate in Tragedy for  not restraining his Passions we mean that every one will for such Neglect unless he timely repents be infallibly punish'd by infinite Justice either here or hereafter  If upon this foot we examine the Tragedies of  Sophocles  and  Euripides  we shall find that in their most beautiful Pieces they are impartial Executors of Poetick Justice And 'tis upon this foot that  Aristotle  requires that we should examine them Your Correspondent I must confess is in the right when he says that that Philosopher declares for Tragedies whose Catastrophes are unhappy with relation to the principal Characters But then what Instructions does he give us for the forming those principal Characters We are neither to make them very vertuous Persons on the one side that is Persons who absolutely command their Passions nor on the other side Villains who are actuated by inveterate Malice but something between these two that is to say Persons who neglecting their Passions suffer them to grow outrageous and to hurry them to Actions which they would otherwise abhor And that Philosopher expressly declares as we have shewn above that to make a vertuous Man unhappy that is a Man who absolutely commands his Passions would create Horror instead of Compassion and would be detested by all  the World And thus we have shewn that  Aristotle  is for Poetical Justice notwithstanding that he is for unhappy Catastrophes And so one would think was your Correspondent For when he enumerates and commends some  English  Tragedies which have unfortunate Catastrophes there are not two of those which he commends whose principal Characters can be said to be innocent and consequently there are not two of them where there is not a due Observance of poetical Justice  Thus Mr  Spectator  I have discussed the Business of poetical Justice and shewn it to be the Foundation of all Tragedy and therefore whatever Persons whether ancient or modern have writ Dialogues which they call Tragedies where this Justice is not observ'd those Persons have entertain'd and amus'd the World with romantick lamentable Tales instead of just Tragedies and of lawful Fables  'Tis not my Business at present to take any farther notice of the Errors of your Correspondent perhaps I no more approve of TragiComedies or Tragedies with double Plots than he does but I hope he will not take it ill if I put him in mind that several of the Plays which he recommended before are TragiComedies and that most of them  have double Plots But he is vilely mistaken if he thinks that TragiComedy is of the Growth of our  English  Theatres  I shall take another Opportunity to shew him that he is as much mistaken in what he has said of Humours as in what he dictates concerning poetical Justice  I am Your very humble  LETTER to the SPECTATOR upon his Paper on the th of  April  SIR  I Have read over your Paper of the  th  with a great deal of Satisfaction and here return you my Acknowledgments for the Honour you have done me in quoting two of my Verses with Applause I think my self oblig'd in Gratitude my worthy Friend to do as much Honour to your Judgment as you have done to my Imagination and as you have the Goodness to allow me to be an humorous Poet I am bound in Justice to celebrate you for a wonderful Critick and to make it appear that contrary to the Observation of the Author of a late Rhapsody one who has shewn himself no great Poet may be a prodigious Judge Indeed the Observation of that Author is so far from being true that most of the Criticks Ancient and Modern have been no Poets and most of the Poets Ancient and Modern have been no Criticks I cannot find out that any but  Homer  and  Virgil  and  Horace  and  Sophocles  and  Euripides  among the Ancients were  great Criticks For who can believe that has read them that  Apollonius Rhodius    Nonnus    Lucan    Statius  and  Silius Italicus  ever so much as heard that Nature and the Philosophers her Interpreters and Commentators had laid down Rules for an Epick Poem And who that has read the Moderns could imagine that most of their Dramatick Poets had ever so much as heard that there were such things as the Rules As  Boileau  has observ'd of the  French  that some Persons among them had distinguish'd themselves by their Rhimes who never knew how to distinguish  Lucan  from  Virgil  so some among our own Rhimers have been renown'd for versifying who never so much as knew that  Horace  and  Milton  were good Poets And I can on the other side name several who never distinguished themselves by Poetry who yet have oblig'd the World with Criticisms which have been Nonpareillo's and the very TopCritick of all those Criticks is my worthy Friend the  Spectator  Tho' who the Devil could have ever expected to have found my worthy Friend a Critick after he had treated Criticks with so much Contempt in two or three of his Immortal  Tatlers  and particularly in the  th  and the  th  where they are pronounc'd to be the silliest of Mortals  Creatures forsooth who profess Judgment tho' by the way Mr  Spectator  he who professes or practises Poetry and does not profess Judgment in it professes himself an Ass It was from those  Tatlers  and one or two more Mr  Spectator  that I guess'd that you had a mortal Aversion to Criticism but now I find plainly that they were none of your own but were sent you by two or three damn'd Poets who are a sort of Offenders that have not half the Charity which other Malefactors are wont to shew but bear eternal Malice to their Executioners  Thus the Invectives against Criticks and Criticism were other Peoples you were too wise to write any such thing as knowing that Tast which declines so fast is only to be restor'd and maintain'd by Criticism And therefore instead of writing Invectives against it you have oblig'd the World with the thing it self with Criticism upon Criticism and such CriticismAs those  Tatlers  were the Offspring of some certain Poets which is manifest by their insipid Satyr like the faint Eagerness of Vinegar decay'd nothing is more clear than that the Criticisms could be none but yours For as you may discover  ex ungue Leonem ex pede Hercules  so in this Case the prodigious Offspring speaks and confesses the Gigantick Father  In your very Folio of the  th  of  April  how have you shewn the Finess of your Discernment and the Profundity of your Penetration by your Encomium of two Verses of my Translation of the Fourth Satyr of  Boileau  Tis now thirty Years since I translated that Satyr and consequently was a very Boy at the Time of that Translation yet from that Time to this the stupid Age has been ignorant of the Beauty of that Couplet How very flegmatick a Wretch have I been and how illegitimate an Offspring of Mr  Bays  not to know any thing of my own Excellence till I heard of it from you  How little did I imagine when I translated that Couplet that the great Critick was then in Embrio who thirty Years afterwards should declare it to be a charming Couplet by giving it a place in his never dying Speculations  I am perfectly convinc'd my most worthy and most ingenious Friend that we Authors are as blind and as partial Judges of our own Works as we are unrighteous ones of other Peoples I was apt to imagine before I submitted my own Opinion to the decisive Authority of your Judgment that you would have done more for the Credit of my Genius and of your own Discernment  by commending the following Verses of the Fourth Book of the Poem upon the Battel of  Ramelies  when you had so fair an occasion of taking notice of them as you had at the writing the  th  Tatler  If I begin the Verses a little higher than the couching of the Cataracts which is the Subject of the  th  Tatler  I am confident you will have the Goodness to pardon me and the rather because you discover'd more than a common Satisfaction when you were present with your Friend Mr  A  at the reading those Verses in Manuscript A celestial Spirit visits the Duke of  Marlborough  in a Vision the Night before the Battel of  Ramelies  and after he has said several other things to him goes on thus  A wondrous Victory attends thy Arms  Great in it self and in its sequel vast  Whose ecchoing Sound thro' all the West shall run  Transporting the glad Nations all around  Who oft shall doubt and oft suspend their Joy  And oft imagine all an empty Dream  The Conqueror himself shall cry amaz'd  'Tis not our Work alas we did it not  The Hand of God the Hand of God is here  For thee so great shall be thy high Renown  That Fame shall think no Musick like thy Name  Around the circling Globe it shall be spread  And to the World's last Ages shall endure  And the most lofty most aspiring Man  Shall want th' Assurance in his secret Pray'rs  To ask such high Felicity and Fame  As Heav'n has freely granted thee yet this  That seems so great so glorious to thee now  Would look how low how vile to thy great Mind  If I could set before thy astonish'd Eyes  Th' Excess of Glory and th' Excess of Bliss  That is prepar'd for thy expiring Soul  When thou arriv'st at everlasting Day  O could embodied Mind but comprehend  The Glories of the Intellectual World  Or I the blissful Secret were allow'd  But Fate forbids to Mortals to reveal  O I could lay a Scene before thy Eyes  Which would distract thee with transporting Joy  Fire the rich Blood in thy illustrious Veins  Make ev'ry Nerve with fierce Convulsions start  Blast all thy Spirits and thy Life destroy  Thou could'st not taste th' Extatick Bliss and live  As one who has liv'd thirty tedious Years  And ever since his wretched Birth been dark  His visual Orbs with cloudy Films o'ercast  And in the Dungeon of the Body dwelt  In utter Ignoranceof Nature's Works  And Wonders of this vast material World  And has no Notion e'er conceiv'd of Light  Or Colours or the verdant flowry Earth  Or the stupendous Prospect of the Sky  If then he finds some Artist whose nice Hand  Couches the Cataracts and clears his Eyes  And all at once a Flood of glorious Light  And this bright Temple of the Universe  The crystal Firmament the blazing Sun  All the amazing Glories of the Heav'ns  All the Great Maker's high Magnificence  Come rushing thro' his Eyes upon his Soul  He cannot bear th'astonishing Delight  But starts exclaims and stamps and raves and dies  So the vast Glories of the upper World  If they were set before embodied Mind  Would oppress Nature and extinguish Life  These are the Verses my most discerning Friend that I thought might have been preferr'd to the foremention'd Couplet especially since they would as it were have introduced themselves whereas the Couplet is dragg'd in by extreme Violence But I submit to your infallible Judgment not in the least suspecting that my worthy Friend can have any Malice in this Affair and insert that Couplet in his immortal Speculations only on purpose to expose me no far be it  from me to entertain any such Jealousy of my dearest Friend who is so good so kind so beneficent and who has so often given himself the glorious Title of the Lover and Benefactor of Mankind Who could imagine that one who hath given himself that glorious Appellation could e'er be prompted by Malice or Passion or Interest thus slily and hypocritically to abuse one whom he had call'd his Friend  I have been apt to believe likewise my worthy Friend that you would have been kinder to your self and to me if instead of commending the foremention'd Couplet you had taken some notice of the following Verses which are in my Paraphrase upon the  Te Deum  especially when you had so fair an occasion to mention them as you had at the writing the  th  Tatler  The Couplet of the translated Satyr was introduced by Violence But how very naturally would the following Verses of the Paraphrase have been mention'd either before or after the last Paragraph of the foremention'd Paper where a Spirit is introduc'd who after he has spoke of that part of the Creation which is too little for human Sight comes afterwards to speak of the immense Objects of Nature after this manner  Tat  I must acknowledge for my own part that altho' it is with much Delight that I see the Traces of Providence in these Instances I still see greater pleasure in considering the Works of the Creation in their Immensity than in their Minuteness For this Reason I rejoice when I strengthen my sight so as to make it pierce into the most remote Spaces and take a view of those Heavenly Bodies which lie out of the reach of Human Eyes tho' assisted by Telescopes what you look upon as one confus'd White in the milky way appears to me a long Tract of Heav'ns distinguish'd by Stars that are ranged in proper Figures and Constellations while you are admiring the Sky in a starry Night I am entertain'd with a variety of Worlds and Suns plac'd one above another and rising up to such an immense Distance that no created Eye can see an end of them  Upon the writing this Paragraph how could you avoid the making mention of Verses which had the very same Ideas and Verses which you had formerly mention'd with Applause in private Conversation I know you will answer that you had entirely forgot them and therefore I take the liberty here to refresh your Memory The Angels are introduc'd in that Paraphrase speaking to  God and saying after other things that which follows  Wheree'er at utmost stretch we cast our Eyes  Thro' the vast frightful Spaces of the Skies  Ev'n there we find thy Glory there we gaze  On thy bright Majesty's unbounded Blaze  Ten thousand Suns prodigious Globes of Light  At once in broad Dimensions strike our sight  Millions behind in the remoter Skies  Appear but Spangles to our wearied Eyes  And when our wearied Eyes want farther strength  To pierce the Void's immeasurable Length  Our vigorous tow'ring Thoughts still farther fly  And still remoter flaming Worlds descry  But ev'n an Angels comprehensive Thought  Cannot extend so far as thou hast wrought  Our vast Conceptions are by swelling brought  Swallow'd and lost in Infinite to nought  How glad am I that the foremention'd Verses were writ before the abovenam'd  Tatlers  Otherwise I should have been thought to have borrow'd from my worthy Friend without making any manner of acknowledgment only adding or endeavouring to add to what I borrow'd a little of that Spirit and Elevation and Magnificence of Expression which the Greatness of the Hints requir'd  'Tis for this Reason that I am glad the Verses were printed some Years before the Prose For you know my dear Friend that a Plagiary in general is but a scandalous Creature a sort of a spiritual Outlaw and ought to be treated as such by all the Members of the Commonwealth of Learning But a Plagiary from living Authors is most profligately impudent and in so slow and splenatick a Nation as ours most unjust and barbarous For among us any thing that is admirably good is twenty or thirty Years before it comes to be understood And how infinitely base is it in the mean while to deprive an Author of any thing that is valuable in him and to intercept his coming Praise As Laws are made for the Security of Property what pity 'tis that there are not some enacted for the Security of a Man's Thoughts and Inventions which alone are properly his For Land is alienable and Treasure is transitory and both must at one time or other pass either by his own voluntary Act or by the Violence and Injustice of others or at least by Fate And therefore nothing is truly and really a Man's own  Puncto quod mobilis Horae  Nunc prece nunc precio nunc vi nunc sorte supremâ  Permutet Dominos cedat in altera Jura  'Tis only a Man's Thoughts and Inventions that are properly his being alone Things that can never be alienated from him neither by Force nor Persuasion nor by Fate it self and tho' another may basely usurp the Honour of them yet they must for ever rightfully belong to their first Inventor Thus even the richest and the happiest of Men have nothing that is truly and really their own but their Thoughts and Inventions But Authors for the most part and especially Poets have nothing that can so much as be call'd their own but their Thoughts 'Tis for those alone and the Glory which they expect from those that they entirely quit their Pretensions to Riches and renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World and therefore to endeavour to deprive them of those is exceedingly inhuman What a Joy 'tis to think that the Precedence of Times sets me free from the Imputation of this Injustice Had I been capable of doing this and doing it to my worthy Friend of wronging my dearest Friend in this manner who knows how far that Barbarity might have extended it self I might have proceeded to have upbraided him with some weak place in his neverdying Folio's and having forcibly depriv'd him of his Silver and his Gold have pelted him with his Brass and his Copper out of counterfeit  Anger or pretended Scorn because they were of no richer Metal  But the Case of my dear Friend is vastly different You have that Reputation and the World has that Opinion of your Merit that they will be so far from believing that you have Obligations to a living Author which you have not that tho' you had really made thus bold with me it would have been impossible to have convinc'd above forty or fifty People of it And here my dear Friend at the same time that I acknowledge your uncommon Merit I cannot but congratulate your incomparable Felicity It being plain that you have got more Reputation in three Years time than  Milton  has done in fifty Years or than  Shakespear  has in an hundred I shall therefore judiciously conclude with the generality of your Readers that you have a Merit paramount to that of all  British  Authors both living and dead and that you have not only more Merit than any one Moralist either Ancient or Modern but that if you continue your Paper Three Years longer you will have as much Merit as they have all together I am  My dear Friend  With great Respect and Fidelity  Your  c  March  the  th    Mr Spectator  YOU tell us in your Fourth Paper that you know Peoples Thoughts by their Eyes How apt we are all to imagine fine Things of our selves especially we Authors Mr  Spectator  There was a certain Friend of mine a Squire lately defunct who made the very same boast that you do and yet he recommended a Pettifogger to me for an honest Fellow who diving into my Secrets betray'd me to those very People with whom he pretended to serve me a Pettifogger thro' whose Eyes even I and several others who pretend to none of my Friend the Squire's Profundity can discern the working of his mischievous Thoughts as plainly as I can see the Operations of Bees thro' a Crystal Hive  As soon Mr  Spectator  as I found my self betray'd I began to enquire into this Fellow's Character tho' if you were to look between his two Eyes you wou'd swear there was no occasion for it For Mr  Spectator  he tells you what he is when he only looks on you and uniting in his pettifogging Person both your noble Attributes is at one  and the same time  Tatler  and  Spectator  In short tho' he is an errant Traytor in his Heart his Face is a plain Dealer and lets you immediately without Ceremony and without Reserve into the inmost Secrets of his Soul  Upon Enquiry I found his Character to be as extraordinary as his Person He is by Politicks a  Jacobite  by Moral Principle a Setter and a Betrayer by Religion a Quaker an utter Foe to all Civil and Religious Ceremony unless it be drinking the Pretender's Health on his Knees to whom alone of the Race of Men he has been true and faithful By this one may guess that his Education has been very extraordinary I find upon the most curious Enquiry that I have been able to make that the only Schools that ever he has been at have been spunging Houses and CountyGaols and that his two Universities have been the  Fleet  and the  Queen'sBench  I hope Mr  Spectator  that this Letter may afford you a Hint for a Lucubration or a Speculation or whatever other learned Term you may be pleas'd to give it which by discovering to your Readers the Error and the Frailty of the Squire lately defunct may convince them how little we know even those with whom we daily converse Alas our Judgments of one another are empty  and superficial and either built upon vain Appearances or the Reports of those who neither truly know us nor speak what they really think of us but often traduce us and misrepresent us in order to comfort or vindicate or to support themselves  But of all Mankind there are none who know the rest of Men so little as the generality of your Authors for this Pettifogger was so foolish a Rogue that any one might see thro' him at first sight And yet my Friend the Squire was stark blind to him By the way you may know that my Friend the Squire was an Author as celebrated an Author as you are Mr  Spectator  a PennyFolio Author He got some Reputation by his Lucubrations but had the Fault of most Authors who have more Imagination than Judgment he could not leave off when he was well not considering Mr  Spectator  that had honest Sir  Martin  left off in time his Mistress had never made the Discovery that  Warner  play'd and sung for him I am  Your  c  To the SPECTATOR  Mr Spectator  I Have a short Case of Conscience to put to you to You who have establish'd your self in the Office of  Ductor Dubitantium  general About  January  last I happen'd to have an Obligation to a certain Author an Obligation that reposed a Trust in me which I have since discharg'd Being pleas'd with the Frankness of this Author's doing this I resolv'd upon reading his celebrated PennyFolio's I mean upon reading them in order For till then I had read but here and there one and none at all of the first two Months The first thing that I observ'd in them was that I was endeavour'd to be expos'd and calumniated clandestinely and perfidiously by one who at the same time caress'd me wheree'er he saw me and call'd himself my Friend and all this only to serve a poor pitiful Turn which was to establish the Opera at the Expence of Dramatick Poetry I say of Dramatick Poetry Mr  Spectator  if it had not been for which that Author had long since been in the Dust The  Quere  is whether the foresaid Obligation ought to debar me of the Right of vindicating the Truth and my self It was not long after this Mr  Spectator  that  the abovesaid Author repented him so far of the Obligation he had laid on me that he insulted and affronted me several times most barbarously by a Wretch so despicable and so impotent that it would have been Cowardice to have beat him a Wretch whose Character will come enclos'd to you in the same Cover with this and not content with that endeavour'd once more to expose me in his Quotidian Folio's The second  Quere  is Mr  Spectator  whether I am not free now I am got quit of the Obligation which was laid upon me tho' it had been far greater than it was to shew my just Resentment which I am about to do by publishing three or four modest Letters which I have pick'd and cull'd from the numerous company of those which are more bitter and which I resolve to suppress in order to shew that I have a Soul that is capable of remembring Obligations as well as of revenging Injuries I impatiently expect your Decision in this matter in the mean time it seems to me that common Sense obliges me to believe that no Man can have an Obligation strong enough laid on him to make him pass by a Box on the Ear or the being expos'd in Print without returning each of th' Affronts in kind I am  Your  c  Oct    FINIS  Books Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT  PRaelectiones Poeticae in Schola naturalis Philosophiae Oxon habitae Authore
