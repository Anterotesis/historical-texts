 THE CASTLE SPECTRE A DRAMA IN FIVE ACTS FIRST PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL DRURYLANE ON THURSDAY DECEMBER  By M G LEWIS Esq M P  AUTHOR OF THE MONK c  Io me n' andro colla barchetta mia  Quanto l'acqua comporta un picciol legno  E ciò ch' io penso colla fantasia  Di piacere ad ognuno è il mio disegno  Ben so che spesso come gia Morgante  Lasciato ho forse troppo andar la mazza  Ma dove sia poi judice bastante  Materia c' è da camera e da piazza  PULCI  LONDON PRINTED FOR J BELL NO OXFORDSTREET MDCCXCVIII  PROLOGUE  SPOKEN BY MR WROUGHTON  FAR from the haunts of men of vice the foe  The moonstruck child of genius and of woe  Versed in each magic spell and dear to fame  A fair enchantress dwells Romance her name  She loathes the sun or blazing taper's light  The moonbeam'd landscape and tempestuous night  Alone she loves and oft with glimmering lamp  Near graves newopen'd or 'midst dungeons damp  Drear forests ruin'd aisles and haunted towers  Forlorn she roves and raves away the hours  Anon when storms howl loud and lash the deep  Desperate she climbs the searock's beetling steep  There wildly strikes her harp's fantastic strings  Tells to the moon how grief her bosom wrings  And while her strange song chaunts fictitious ills  In wounded hearts Oblivion's balm distills  A youth who yet has lived enough to know  That life has thorns and taste the cup of woe  As late near Conway's timebowed towers he stray'd  Invok'd this bright enthusiasts magic aid  His prayer was heard With arms and bosom bare  Eyes flashing fire loose robes and streaming hair  Her heart all anguish and her soul all flame  Swift as her thoughts the lovely maniac came  High heav'd her breasts which struggling passions rent  As prest to give some fearfraught mystery vent  And oft with anxious glance and alter'd face  Trembling with terror she relaxed her pace  And stopt and listenedThen with hurried tread  Onwards again she rush'd yet backwards bent her head  As if from murderous swords or following fiends she fled  Soon as near Conway's walls her footsteps drew  She bade the youth their ancient state renew  Eager he sped the fallen towers to rear  'Twas done and fancy bore the fabric here  Next choosing from great Shakspeare's comic school  The gossip crone gross friar and gibing fool  These with a virgin fair and lover brave  To our young author's care the enchantress gave  But charged him ere he bless'd the brave and fair  To lay th' exulting villain's bosom bare  And by the torments of his conscience show  That prosperous vice is but triumphant woe  The pleasing task congenial to his soul  Oft from his own sad thoughts our author stole  Blest be his labours if with like success  They soothe their sorrows whom I now address  Beneath this dome should some afflicted breast  Mourn slighted talents or desert opprest  False friendship hopeless love or faith betray'd  Our author will esteem each toil o'erpaid  If while his muse exerts her livelier vein  Or tells imagined woes in plaintive strain  Her flights and fancies make one smile appear  On the pale cheek where trickled late a tear  Or if  her  fabled sorrows steal one groan  Which else her hearers would have given their own  EPILOGUE  SPOKEN BY MRS JORDAN  OSMOND by this arrived at Charon's ferry  My honour saved and dad alive and merry  Hither I come the public doom to know  But come not uncompell'dthe more's my woe  E'en now oh pity friends my hard mishap  My shoulder felt a BowStreet runner's tap  Who while I shook with fear in every limb  Thus spoke with accent stern and visage grim  "Mistress" quoth he "to me it given in trust is  "To bring you straight before our larned Justice  "For know 'tis said tonight the whole town o'er  "You've kill'd one Osmond alias Barrymore"  "The fellow's mad" 'twas thus amaz'd I spoke  "Lord Sir I murdered Osmond for a joke  "This dagger free from blood will make it certain  "He died but till the prompter dropped the curtain  "And now well pleased to quit this scene of riot  "The man's gone home to sup in peace and quiet"  Finding that all I said was said in vain  And Townshend still his first design maintain  I thought 'twere best to fly for shelter here  And beg my generous friends to interfere  But though the awkward nature of my case  May spread some slight confusion o'er my face  No terrors awe my bosom I'll assure ye  Just is my cause and English is my jury  Besides it must appear on explanation  How very ticklish was my situation  And all perforce his crimes when I relate  Must own that Osmond well deserved his fate  He heeded not papa's pathetic pleading  He stabbed mamawhich was extreme illbreeding  And at his feet for mercy when  I  sued  The odious wretch I vow was downright rude  Twice his bold hands my person dared to touch  Twice in one day'Twas really once too much  And therefore justly filled with virtuous ire  To save my honour and protect my fire  I drew my knife and in his bosom stuck it  He fell you clappedand then he kicked the bucket  So perish still the wretch whose soul can know  Selfish delight while causing other's woe  Who blasts that joy the sweetest God has given  And makes an hell where love would make an heaven  Forbear thou lawless libertine nor seek  Forc'd favours on that pale averted cheek  If thy warm kisses cost bright eyes one tear  Kisses from loveliest lips are bought too dear  Unless those lips with thine keep playful measure  And that sweet tear should be a tear of pleasure  Now as for Osmondat that villain's name  I feel reviving wrath my soul inflame  And shall one short and sudden pang suffice  To clear so base a fault so gross a vice  No To your bar dear friends for aid I fly  Bid Osmond live again again to die  Nightly with plaudits loud his breath recall  Nightly beneath my dagger see him fall  Give him a thousand livesand let  me  take them all  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  OSMOND  Mr BARRYMORE  REGINALD  Mr WROUGHTON  PERCY  Mr KEMBLE  FATHER

repeat it you are a fellow of a very scandalous course of life  MOTL  And I repeat it I'm a perfect image of the purest virtue compared to whom for sobriety and continence Cato was a drunkard and Lucretia little better than she should be  F PHIL  Oh hardened in impudenceCan you deny being a pilferer a lyar a glutton  MOTL  Can IHeaven be thanked I've courage enough to deny any thing  F PHIL  Doesn't all the world cry out upon you  MOTL  Certainly my transcendant merit has procured me some enemies and in common with many other great men my virtue at present labours under something of a cloud But understand me right Father Though I don't assent to the sumtotal  of your accusations possibly I may acknowledge some of the items the best actions frequently appear culpable merely because their motives are unexplained Therefore produce your charges let me justify my conduct and I doubt not I shall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immaculate and pure as a new sheet of foolscap  F PHIL  To begin then with your pilfering Did you or did you not break open the pantrydoor and steal out the great goosepye  MOTL  Begging your pardon Father that was no fault of mine  F PHIL  Whose then  MOTL  The cook's undoubtedly for if he hadn't locked the pantrydoor 'tis an hundred to one I shouldn't have taken the trouble to break it open  F PHIL  Nonsense NonsenseI tell you you've been guilty of stealing which is a monstrous crime And what did you steal Had you taken any thing else I might have forgiven you but to lay irreverent hands upon the goosepyeAs I'm a Christian the identical goosepye which I intended for my own supperBut this is not my only objection to your conduct  MOTL  No  F PHIL  What principally offends me is that you pervert the minds of the maids and keep kissing and smuggling all the pretty girls you meet Oh fye fye  MOTL  I kiss and smuggle them St Francis forbid Lord love you Father 'tis they who kiss and smuggle me I protest I do what I can to preserve my modesty and I wish that Archbishop Dunstan had heard the lecture upon chastity which I read last night to the dairymaid in the dark  he'd have been quite edified But yet what does talking signify The eloquence of my lips is counteracted by the lustre of my eyes and really the little devils are so tender and so troublesome that I'm half angry with nature for having made me so very bewitching  F PHIL  Nonsense Nonsense  MOTL  Why it was but yesterday that Cicely and Luce went to fiftycuffs quarrelling which looked neatestmy red leg or my yellow one Then they are so fond and so coaxing They hang about one so lovingly And one says "Kind Mr Motley" and t' other "Sweet Mr Motley"Ah Father Philip Father Philip How is a poor little bit of flesh and blood like me to resist such temptationPut yourself in my place Suppose that a sweet smiling rogue just sixteen with rosy cheeks sparkling eyes pouting lips c  F PHIL  Oh fye fye fyeTo hear such licentious discourse brings the tears into my eyes  MOTL  I believe you Father for I see the water is running over at your mouth However this shews you  F PHIL  It shews me that you are a reprobate and that my advice is thrown away upon you In future I shall keep those counsels to myself which I offered you from motives of pure Christian charity  MOTL  Charity my good Father should always begin at home Now instead of giving yourself so much trouble to mend me what if you thought a little of correcting yourself  F PHIL  II have nothing to correct  MOTL  No to be sure  F PHIL  The odour of my sanctity perfumes the whole kingdom  MOTL  It has a powerful smell about it I own not unlike carrion you may wind it a mile off  F PHIL  All malice  MOTL  Not exactly I could mention some little points which might be altered in you still better than in myself such as intemperance gluttony  F PHIL  GluttonyOh abominable falsehood  MOTL  Plain matter of factWhy will any man pretend to say that you came honestly by that enormous belly that tremendous tomb of fish flesh and fowl I protest I'm grateful to Heaven that among the unclean Beasts who accompanied Noah there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks they must infallibly have created a famine and then the world would never have been repeopledNext for incontinence you must allow yourself that you are unequalled  F PHIL  I I  MOTL  You youMay I ask what was your business in the beechgrove the other evening when I caught you with buxom Margery the miller's pretty wife Was it quite necessary to lay your heads together so close  F PHIL  Perfectly necessary I was whispering in her ear wholsome advice  MOTL  Indeed Faith then she took your advice as kindly as it was given and exactly in the same way too you gave it with your lips and she took it with hersWell done Father Philip  F PHIL  Son Son you give your tongue too great a licence  MOTL  Nay Father be not angry Fools you know are privileged persons  F PHIL  I know they are very useless ones and in short Master Motley to be plain with you of  all fools I think you the worst and for fools of all kinds I've an insuperable aversion  MOTL  Really Then you have one good quality at least and I cannot but admire such a total want of selflove  An horn sounds  But hark 'tis the dinnerhorn Away to table FatherDepend upon't the servants will rather eat part of their dinner unblessed than stay till your stomach comes like Jonas's whale and swallows up the whole  F PHIL  Well well fool I am going but first let me explain to you that my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite No son no Little sustenance do I take but St Cuthbert's blessing is upon me and that little prospers with me most marvellously Verily the Saint has given me rather too plentiful an increase and my legs are scarce able to support the weight of his bounties  Exit  MOTL  Alone  He looks like an over grown turtle waddling upon its hind finsYet at bottom 'tis a good fellow enough warmhearted benevolent friendly and sincere but no more intended by nature to be a monk than I to be a maid of honour to the queen of Sheba  Going  Enter  PERCY  PERCY  I cannot be mistaken in spite of his dress his features are too well known to me Hist Gilbert Gilbert  MOTL  Gilbert Oh Lord that's IWho calls  PERCY  Have you forgotten me  MOTL  Truly sir that would be no easy matter I never forgot in my life what I never knew  PERCY  Have ten years altered me so much that you cannot  MOTL  Hey Can it be Pardon my dear master pardonIn truth you may well forgive my having forgotten  your  name for at first I didn't very well remember my own However to prevent further mistakes I must inform you that he who in your father's service was Gilbert the knave is Motley the fool in the service of Earl Osmond  PERCY  Of Earl Osmond This is fortunate Gilbert you may be of use to me and if the attachment which as a boy you professed for me still exists  MOTL  It does with ardour unabated for I'm not so unjust as to attribute to you my expulsion from Alnwic Castle in fact I deserved it for I cannot deny but that at twenty I was as goodfornothing a knave as ever existed consequently old Earl Percy dismissed me from his service but I know that it was sorely against your inclination You were then scarce fourteen and I had been your companion and playfellow from your childhood I remember well your grief at parting with me and that you slipped into my hand the purse which contained the whole of your little treasure That act of kindness struck to my heart I swore at the moment to love you through life and it ever I forget my oath damn me  PERCY  My honest GilbertAnd what made you assume this habit  MOTL  Ah my Lord what could I doIn spite of my knavery and tricks I was constantly upon the point of starving and having once contracted an idle habit of eating I never could bring myself to leave it off After living five years by my wits want drove me almost out of them I knew not what course to take when I heard that  Earl Osmond's jester had fled the country I exerted my knavery for the last time in stealing the fugitive's cast coat was accepted in his place by the Earl and now gain an honest livelihood by persuading my neighbours that I'm a greater fool than themselves  PERCY  And your change is for the better  MOTL  Infinitely indeed your fool is universally preferred to your knaveand for this reason your fool is cheated your knave cheats Now everybody had rather cheat than be cheated  PERCY  Some truth in that  MOTL  And now sir may I ask what brings you to Wales  PERCY  A woman whom I adore  MOTL  Yes I guessed that the business was about a petticoat And this woman is  PERCY  The orphan ward of a villager without friends without family without fortune  MOTL  Great points in her favour I must confess And which of these excellent qualities won your heart  PERCY  I hope I had better reasons for bestowing it on her No Gilbert I loved her for a person beautiful without art and graceful without affectationfor an heart tender without weakness and noble without pride I saw her at once beloved and reverenced by her village companions they looked on her as a being of a superior order and I felt that she who gave such dignity to the cottagemaid must needs add new lustre to the coronet of the Percies  MOTL  From which I am to understand that you mean to marry this rustic  PERCY  Could I mean otherwise I should blush for myself  MOTL  Yet surely the baseness of her origin  PERCY  Can to me be no objection in giving her my hand I raise her to my station not debase myself to hers nor ever while gazing on the beauty of a rose did I think it less fair because planted by a peasant  MOTL  BravoAnd what says your good grumbling father to this  PERCY  Alas he has long slept in the grave  MOTL  Then he's quiet at last Well God grant him that peace in heaven which he suffered nobody to enjoy on earthBut his death having left you master of your actions what obstacle now prevents your marriage  PERCY  You shall hearFearful lest my rank should influence this lovely girl's affections and induce her to bestow her hand on the noble while she refused her heart to the man I assumed a peasant's habit and presented myself as Edwy the lowborn and the poor In this character I gained her heart and resolved to hail as Countess of Northumberland the betrothed of Edwy the lowborn and the poor  MOTL  I warrant the pretty soul wasn't displeased with the discovery  PERCY  That discovery is still unmade Judge how great must have been my disappointment when on entering her guardian's cottage with this design he informed me that the unknown who sixteen years before had confided her to his care had reclaimed her on that very morning and conveyed her no one knew whither  MOTL  That was unlucky  PERCY  Was it notAh had I declared myself one day sooner ere this she would have been my wife  MOTL  True and being your wife if a stranger then had conveyed her no one knew whither you might have thought yourself mightily obliged to him  PERCY  However in spite of his precautions I have traced the stranger's course and find him to be Kenric a dependent upon Earl Osmond  MOTL  Surely 'tis not Lady Angela who  PERCY  The very same Speak my good fellow do you know her  MOTL  Not by your description for here she's understood to be the daughter of Sir Malcolm Mowbray my master's deceased friend And what is your present intention  PERCY  To demand her of the Earl in marriage  MOTL  Ohthat will never dofor in the first place you'll not be able to get a sight of him I've now lived with him five long years and till Angela's arrival never witnessed a guest in the CastleOh 'tis the most melancholy mansion And as to its master he's the very antidote to mirth He always walks with his arms folded his brows bent his eyes louring on you with a gloomy scowl He never smiles and to laugh in his presence would be high treason He looks at no onespeaks to no one None dare approach him except Kenric and his four blacks all others are ordered to avoid him and whenever he quits his room ding dong goes a great bell and away run the servants like so many scared rabbits  PERCY  Strangeand  what  reasons can be have for  MOTL  Oh reasons in plenty You must  know there's an ugly story respecting the last owners of this CastleOsmond's brother his wife and infant child were murdered by banditti as it was said unluckily the only servant who escaped the slaughter deposed that he recognised among the assassins a black still in the service of Earl Osmond The truth of this assertion was never known for the servant was found dead in his bed the next morning  PERCY  Good heavens  MOTL  Since that time no sound of joy has been heard in Conway Castle Osmond instantly became gloomy and ferocious he now never utters a sound except a sigh has broken every tye of society and keeps his gates barred unceasingly against the stranger  PERCY  Yet Angela is admittedBut no doubt affection for her father  MOTL  Why no I rather think that affection for her father's child  PERCY  How  MOTL  If I've any knowledge in love the Earl feels it for his fair ward But the Lady will tell you more of this if I can procure for you an interview  PERCY  The very request which  MOTL  'Tis no easy matter I promise you but I'll do my best In the meanwhile wait for me in yonder fishing hutits owner's name is Edric tell him that I sent you and he will give you a retreat  PERCY  Farewell then and remember that whatever reward  MOTL  Dear master to mention a reward insults me You have already shown me kindness and  when 'tis in my power to be of use to you to need the inducement of a second favour would prove me a scoundrel undeserving of the first  Exit  PERCY  How warm is this good fellow's attachment Yet our Barons complain that the great can have no friends If they have none let their own pride bear the blame Instead of looking with scorn on those whom a smile would attract and a favour bind for ever how many firm friends might our nobles gain if they would but reflect that their vassals are men as they are and have hearts whose feelings can be grateful as their own  Exit  SCENE II  The CastleHall  SAIB  and  HASSAN  meeting  SAIB  Now Hassan what success  HASS  My search has been fruitless In vain have I paced the river's banks and pierced the grove's deepest recesses Nor glen nor thicket have I passed unexplored yet found no stranger to whom Kenric's description could apply  SAIB  Saw you no one  HASS  A troop of horsemen passed me as I left the wood  SAIB  Horsemen say youThen Kenric may be right Earl Percy has discovered Angela's abode and lurks near the Castle in hopes of carrying her off  HASS  His hopes then will be vain Osmond's vigilance will not easily be eludedsharpened by those powerful motives love and fear  SAIB  His love I know but should he lose Angela what has he to fear  HASS  If Percy gains her every thing Supported  by such wealth and power dangerous would be her claim to these domains should her birth be discovered Of this our Lord is aware nor did he sooner hear that Northumberland loved her than he hastened to remove her from Allan's care At first I doubt his purpose was a foul one her resemblance to her mother induced him to change it He now is resolved to make her his bride and restore to her those rights of which himself deprived her  SAIB  Think you the Lady perceives that our Master loves her  HASS  I know she does not Absorbed in her own passion for Percy on Osmond's she bestows no thought and while roving through these pompous halls and chambers sighs for the Cheviot Hills and Allan's humble cottage  SAIB  But as she still believes Percy to be a lowborn swain when Osmond lays his coronet at her feet will she reject his rank and splendour  HASS  If she loves well she will Saib I too have loved I have known how painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung how incapable was all else to supply her loss I have exchanged want for plenty fatigue for rest a wretched hut for a splendid palace But am I happier Oh no Still do I regret my native land and the partners of my poverty Then toil was sweet to me for I laboured for Samba then repose ever blest my bed of leaves for there by my side lay Samba sleeping  SAIB  This from you HassanDid love ever find a place in your flinty bosom  HASS  Did it Oh Saib my heart once was gentle once was good But sorrows have broken  it insults have made it hard I have been dragged from my native land from a wife who was every thing to me to whom I was every thing Twenty years have elapsed since these Christians tore me away they trampled upon my heart mocked my despair and when in frantic terms I raved of Samba laughed and wondered how a negro's soul could feel In that moment when the last point of Africa faded from my view when as I stood on the vessel's deck I felt that all I loved was to me lost for ever in that bitter moment did I banish humanity from my breast I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair I gave to the sea the precious token and while the high waves swift bore it from me vowed aloud endless hatred to mankind I have kept my oath I  will  keep it  SAIB  Illstarred Hassan your wrongs have indeed been great  HASS  To remember them unmans meFarewell I must to Kenric HoldLook where he comes from Osmond's chamber  SAIB  And seemingly in wrath  HASS  His conferences with the Earl of late have had no other end The period of his favour is arrived  SAIB  Not of his favour merely Hassan  HASS  How Mean you that  SAIB  His anxiety for independence his wish to withdraw himself from Walesyet more certain mysterious words and threats for some time past have made our Lord uneasy By him was I this morning commissioned Silence He's here you shall know more anon  Enter  KENRIC  KENR  His promise ever evaded My request still heard with impatience and treated with neglectOsmond I will bear your ingratitude no longerNow Hassan found you the man described  HASS  Nor any that resembled him  KENR  Yet that I saw Percy I am convinced As I crossed him in the wood his eye met mine He started as had he seen a basilisk and fled with rapidity Be on your guard my friends Doubtless he will attempt to gain admission to the Castle  HASS  Can we be otherwise than watchful when we see how well the Earl rewards his followers  SAIB  Of that Kenric you are an example Have you obtained that recompence so long promised Do you enjoy that independence which  KENR  Saib the Earl's ingratitude cuts me to the heart Attached to him from his infancy I have long been his friend long fancied him mine The illusion is now over He sees that I can serve him no furtherknows that I can harm him much therefore he fears and fearing hates me But I will submit no longer to this painful dependence Tomorrow for the last time will I summon him to perform his promise If he refuses I will bid him farewell for ever and by my absence free him from a restraint equally irksome to myself and him  SAIB  Will you so KenricBe speedy then or you will be too late  KENR  Too late And wherefore  SAIB  You will soon receive the reward of your services  KENR  Ha Know you what that reward will be  SAIB  I guess but may not tell  KENR  Is it a secret  SAIB  Can you keep one  KENR  Faithfully  SAIB  As faithfully can I Come Hassan  Exeunt  KENR  alone  What meant the slave Those doubtful expressions Ha should the Earl intend me false Kenric Kenric how is thy nature changed There was a time when fear was a stranger to my bosomwhen guiltless myself I dreaded not art in others Now where'er I turn me danger appears to lurk and I suspect treachery in every breast because my own heart hides it  Exit  Enter Father  PHILIP  followed by  ALICE  F PHIL  NonsenseYou silly woman what you say is not possible  ALICE  I never said it was possible I only said it was true and that if ever I heard music I heard it last night  F PHIL  Perhaps the fool was singing to the servants  ALICE  The fool indeed Oh fye fye How dare you call my Lady's ghost a fool  F PHIL  Your Lady's ghostYou silly old woman  ALICE  Yes Father yes I repeat it I heard the guitar lying upon the Oratory table play the  very air which the Lady Evelina used to sing while rocking her little daughter's cradle She warbled it so sweetly and ever at the close it went  singing  Lullaby Lullaby hush thee my dear  Thy father is coming and soon will be here  F PHIL  Nonsense nonsenseWhy pr'ythee Alice do you think that your Lady's ghost would get up at night only to sing Lullaby for your amusementBesides how should a spirit which is nothing but air play upon an instrument of material wood and catgut  ALICE  How can I tellWhy I know very well that men are made but if you desired me to make a man I vow and protest I shouldn't know how to set about it I can only say that last night I heard the ghost of my murdered Lady  F PHIL  Playing upon the spirit of a cracked guitarAlice Alice these fears are ridiculous The idea of ghosts is a vulgar prejudice and they who are timid and absurd enough to encourage it prove themselves the most contemptible  ALICE  screaming  Oh Lord bless us  F PHIL  WhatHeyOh dear  ALICE  Look lookA figure in white It comes from the haunted room  F PHIL  dropping on

 Truly so am IBut what say you now Father to the fear of spectres  F PHIL  In good faith Alice that my theory was better than my practice However the next time that you are afraid of a ghost remember and make use of the receipt which I shall now give you and instead of calling for a priest to lay the spirits of other people in the red sea call for a bottle of red wine to raise your own Probatum est  Exit  ALICE  alone  Wine indeedI believe he thinks I like drinking as well as himself No no Let the old toping friar take his bottle of wine I shall confine myself to plain cherrybrandy  Enter  ANGELA  ANG  I am weary of wandering from room to room in vain do I change the scene discontent is every where There was a time when music could delight my ear and nature could charm my eyewhen as the dawn unveiled the landscape each object it disclosed to me looked pleasant and fair and while the last sunbeams yet lingered on the western sky I could pour forth a prayer of gratitude and thank my good angels for a day unclouded by sorrowNow all is gone all lost all faded  ALICE  Lady  ANG  Perhaps at this moment he thinks upon me Perhaps he wanders on those mountains where we so oft have strayed reclines on that bank where we so oft have sat or listens sadly to the starling which he taught to repeat my name Perhaps then he sighs and murmurs to himself  The flowers the rivulets the birds every object reminds me of my wellbeloved but what  shall remind her of Edwy  Oh that will my heart Edwy I need no other remembrancer  ALICE  Lady Lady AngelaShe minds me no more than a post

may be frightened  ANG  No noProceed I entreat you  ALICE  Why then they to say that the chamber in which you sleep is haunted You may have observed two foldingdoors which are ever kept locked they lead to the Oratory in which the Lady Evelina passed most of her time while my Lord was engaged in the Scottish wars She would fit there good soul hour after hour playing on the lute and singing airs so sweet so sad that many a time and oft have I wept to hear her Ah when I kissed her hand at the Castlegate little did I suspect that her fate would have been so wretched  ANG  And what was her fate  ALICE  A sad one Lady Impatient to embrace her Lord after a year's absence the Countess set out to meet him on his return from Scotland accompanied by a few domestics and her infantdaughter then scarce a twelvemonth old But as she returned with her husband robbers surprised the party scarce a mile from the Castle and since that time no news has been received of the Earl of the Countess the servants or the child  ANG  Dreadful Were not their corses found  ALICE  Never The only domestic who escaped pointed out the scene of action and as it proved to be on the river's banks doubtless the assassins plunged the bodies into the stream  ANG  Strange And did Earl Osmond then become owner of this CastleAlice was he ever suspected of  ALICE  Speak lower Lady It was said so I own but for my own part I never believed it To my certain knowledge Osmond loved the Lady Evelina too well to hurt her and when he heard of her death he wept and sobbed as if his heart were breaking Nay 'tis certain that he proposed to her before marriage and would have made her his wife only that she liked his brother better Well she might indeed for Earl Reginald was a sweeter gentleman by half  ANG  And in that Oratory you sayGood Alice you have the key of it Let me see that Oratory tonight  ALICE  Tonight Lady Heaven preserve me I wouldn't enter it after dark for the world  ANG  But before dark Alice  ALICE  Before dark Why that indeedWell well we'll see Lady But I hope you're not alarmed by what I mentioned of the Cedarroom  ANG  No truly Alice from good spirits I have nothing to fear and heaven and my innocence will protect me against bad  ALICE  My very sentiments I protest But Heaven forgive me while I stand gossiping here I warrant all goes wrong in the kitchen Your pardon Lady I must

morning to find myself dead in my bed  PERCY  If such are your fears why not lead  me at once to Angela Are we not more exposed in this open hall  MOTL  Be contented and leave all to me I will contrive matters so that Osmond shall have you before his eyes and be no jot the wiserHere  Taking down a suit of armour  Put on this coat of mail you must make up your mind to play a statue for an hour or two  PERCY  How  MOTL  Nay 'tis absolutely necessaryQuick quick ere the servants quit the hall where they are now at dinnerHere's the helmetthe gauntletthe shieldSo now take this truncheon in your hand and there we have you armed capapee  PERCY  And now be good enough to explain what purpose this masquerade is to answer  MOTL  Willingly You are to know that since the late Earl's death the Castle is thought to be haunted the servants are fully persuaded that his ghost wanders every night through the long galleries and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy mansion He is supposed to be drest in compleat armour and that which you wear at present was formerly his Now hear my plan The Earl prepares to hold a conference with Lady Angela even now I heard her summoned to attend him in the Armoury Placed upon this pedestal you may listen to their discourse unobserved and thus form a proper judgment both of your mistress and her guardian As soon as it grows dark I will conduct you to Angela's apartments the obscurity will then shelter you from discovery and even should you be observed you will pass for Earl Reginald's spectre  PERCY  I do not dislike your plan but tell me Gilbert do you believe this tale of the apparition  MOTL  Oh Heaven forbid Not a word of it Had I minded all the strange things related of this Castle I should have died of fright in the first halfhour Why they say that Earl Hubert rides every night round the Castle on a white horse that the ghost of Lady Bertha haunts the west pinnacle of the ChapelTower and that Lord Hildebrand who was condemned for treason some sixty years ago may be seen in the Great Hall regularly at midnight playing at football with his own head Above all they say that the spirit of the late Countess sits nightly in her Oratory and sings her baby to sleep However if it be so  A bell sounds thrice loud and solemn  Hark 'tis the EarlQuick to your post  Percy  ascends the pedestal  Farewell I must get out of his way but as soon as he quits this chamber I'll rejoin you  PERCY  Do so and farewell  Exit  Motley  The foldingdoors are thrown open  Saib Hassan Muley  and  Alaric

motions to his attendants and they withdraw He appears lost in thought then suddenly rises and again traverses the room with disordered steps  OSM  I will not sacrifice my happiness to hers For sixteen long years have I thirsted and now when the cup of joy again stands full before me shall I dash it from my lip No Angela you ask of me too much Since the moment when I pierced her heart deprived of whom life became odious since my soul was stained with his blood who loved me with hers whom I loved no form has been grateful to my eye no voice spoken pleasure  to my soul save Angela's save only Angela's Doting upon one whom death has long clasped in his arms tortured by desires which I never hoped to satisfy many a mournful year has my heart known no throb but of anguish no guest but remorse at committing a fruitless crime Hope that stranger once more revisits my bosom the fiend who led me through passion's mazes to the heights of guilt owns that a crime so great well merits a reward He bids the monument's jaws unclose Evelina revives in her daughter and soon shall the fires which consume me be quenched in Angela's arms What though her heart be Percy's What though she prefer a basilisk's kiss to mine Because my shortlived joy may cause her eternal sorrow shall I reject those pleasures sought so long desired so earnestly That will I not by Heaven Mine she is and mine she shall be though Reginald's bleeding ghost flit before me and thunder in my ear"Hold Hold"Peace stormy heart She comes  Enter  ANGELA  OSM  in a softened voice  Come hither Angela Wherefore so

infancy I still thirst for those simple pleasures which habit has made to me most dear The birds which my own hands reared and the flowers which my own hands planted the banks on which I rested when

breeze whispered among the honeysuckles which bloomed above us and the full moon tinged with her silver light the distant towers of Alnwic It was then that for the first time I gave him my hand and I

his sword  Hell and fiends I'll follow him though lightnings blast me  He rushes distractedly from the chamber  When I wrote the foregoing scene I really believed the invention to be entirely my own But the situations of Angela Osmond and Percy so closely resemble those of Isabella Manfred and the animated portrait in The Castle of Otranto that I am convinced the idea must have been suggested to me by that beautiful RomanceWherever I can trace any plagiarisms whether wilful or involuntary I shall continue to point them out to the reader without reserve    SCENE II  The CastleHall  Enter

justify unworthy means If you were wronged why sought you not your right with your sword's point I then should have esteemed you a noble foe and as such would have treated you But you have stooped to paltry artifice and attacked me like some midnight ruffian privately and in disguise By this am I authorized to forget your station and make your penance as degrading as your offence was base  PERCY  If such are indeed your sentiments prove  them now Restore my sword unsheathe your own and be Angela the conqueror's reward  OSM  No Earl PercyI am not so rash a gamester as to suffer that cast to be

persons I think it necessary to observe to my readers that the foregoing speech is not meant to contain a moral sentiment but to display the false reasoning of a guilty conscience If I were not to make this explanation I should expect to see it asserted that the whole Play was meant to inculcate the doctrine of Fatality  "  Exit followed by  Hassan  and  Alaric  who lock the door after them

Thuringia being condemned to death made his escape by taking so desperate a leap from the window of his prison that he was afterwards known throughout Germany by the name of 'Ludwig the Springer'There

girl who by your own account is neither your chick nor child  ALLAN  Ah She was more to me She was my all Edric my allHow could I bear my home when it no longer was the home of Angela How could I rest in my cottage at night when her sweet lips had not kissed meand murmured "Father sleep well"She is so good so gentleI was sick once sick almost to death Angela was then my nurse and comforter She watched me when I slept and cheered me when I woke She rejoiced when I grew better and when I grew worse no medicine gave me ease like the tears of pity which fell on my burning cheeks from the eyes of my darling  EDRIC  Tears of pity indeed A little rhubarb would have done you more good by halfBut our people stay a long time Perhaps Motley has been discovered and seized if so he will lose his life the Earl his freedom Angela her lover and  what's worst of all I shall lose my boat I wish I hadn't lent it for I doubt that Motley's scheme has failed  ALLAN  I hope notOh I hope notShould Percy

me  PERCY  She is well my old friend and I have spoken to herthough but for a moment Scarce had I time to confess to her my rank when Kenric whose suspicious eye had penetrated my disguise forced me from her presence But be comforted good Allan Should other means fail I will this very night attack the Castle and compel Osmond to resign his prey  ALLAN  Heaven grant that you may succeed Let me but once see Angela your bride Let me but once hear her say the sweet words "Allan I am happy" then I and my old wife will seek our graves lay us down and die with pleasure  MOTL  Die with pleasure you silly old man you shall do nothing so ridiculous You shall live a great many years and instead of lying down in your grave we'll tuck you up warm with your old wife in the best downbed of Alnwic

passed beneath his window the pious porpus contrived to drop this letter into the boat Its contents must needs be of consequence for I assure you it comes from one of the greatest men in England Pray examine it my Lord I never can read when the wind's easterly  PERCY  I believe Gilbert were it northerly you would be no jot the wiser I remember that many a sound stick did our preceptor break upon your back in vain and before you had learned  to spell your schooling had cost my father a forest  MOTL  while  Percy  reads  Nay if learning could have been beaten into me by this time I should be a prodigious scholarTo do him justice Father Benjamin had a most instructive jirk with his arm and frequently used arguments so forcible when pointing out my faults that many a time and oft has he brought tears into my eyes Then I generally felt so penitent and so low that I was obliged to steal his brandybottle in order to recover my spiritsWell Sir what says the letter  PERCY  Listen"I have recognised you in spite of your disguise and seize the opportunity to advise your exerting yourself solely to obtain Earl Percy's liberty Heed not Angela I have sure and easy means for procuring her escape and before the clock strikes two you may expect me with her at the fisherman's hut Farewell and rely upon Father Philip"Now Gilbert what say you May the monk's fidelity be trusted  MOTL  His fidelity may undoubtedly but whether his success will equal his good intentions is a point which time alone can decide Should it not  PERCY  Then with my faithful vassals will I storm the Castle tomorrow  ALLAN  What storm the CastleOh no no My darling never saw a bird die but she wept then how will she bear to look on when men perish  PERCY  Be assured old man that nothing save invincible necessity shall induce me to bathe my hands in the blood of my fellowcreaturesBut where are my followers  ALLAN  Fearing lest their numbers should excite suspicion I left them concealed in yonder wood  PERCY  Guide me to them Edric for this night I must request the shelter of your hut  EDRIC  Willingly my Lord But my cottage is so humble your treatment so wretched  PERCY  Silence my good fellow The

the riverif you'll help to catch it why do so and thank you heartily Can you fish  MOTL  Can I Who in this world cannot I'll assure you friend Edric there is no profession more universal than yours we all spread our nets  to catch something or otherand alas when obtained it seldom proves worth the trouble of taking The Coquette fishes for hearts which are worthless the Courtier for titles which are absurd  On the strength of this single sentence it was boldly asserted on the morning after the first performance that the whole Play was written to support the Cause of Equality and that I said in it all distinctions of rank ought to be abolished and thought it extremely wrong for any persons to accept titles To make the thing complete the assertors should have added that I thought it extremely wrong for any persons to pay compliments or possess hearts  and the Poet for compliments which are emptyOh happy are they in this world of disappointments who throw out no nets save fishing ones

should pop out on me  Blessed St Bridget there would be a têteàtête Yet this is a foolish fear'Tis yet scarce eight o'clock and your ghosts always keep late hours yet I don't like the idea of our being such near neighbours If Alice says true the apparition just now lives next door to me but the Lord forbid that we should ever be visiting acquaintance Would I had something to drive her out of my head A good book now or a bottle of sack St Augustine or a cold venison pasty would be worth its weight in gold but in the chambers of these young girls one finds nothing good either to read drink

Ah little did I think that the man then seated beside me was he whom I envied for his power of doing good whom I loved for exerting that power so largelyJudge then Earl Osmond on my arrival here how strongly I must have felt the contrastWhat peasant names you his benefactor What beggar has been comforted by your bounty what sick man preserved by your careYour breast is unmoved by woe your ear is deaf to complaint your doors are barred against the poor and wretched Not so are the gates of Alnwic Castle they are open as their owner's heart  ALICE  My hair stands on end to hear her  OSM

quitted the Castle never to return  F PHIL  I'm out of all patience  ALICE  And that guitarHow often have I heard her play upon that guitar She would sit in yonder window for hours and still she played airs so sad so sweetTo be sure she had the finest voice that ever  During this speech  Angela  who at first looks round with curiosity throws the veil carelessly over her face and taking the guitar from the table strikes a few wild and melancholy notes  Alice  whose back is towards her turns hastily round screams and rushes from the Oratory  Angela  casts the veil and guitar upon the table and follows her  ANG  What alarms you  ALICE  Is it you Lady Let me die if I didn't take you for the ghostYour air your look your attitude all were so like the deceased Countess thatWell well I'll not enter that room again in an hurry I protest my hand trembles so that I can hardly turn the key  ANG  How contagious is terror This silly woman's apprehensions have spread to my bosom and scarce can I look round without alarm The stillness too of eveningThe wavering and mysterious light which streams through these painted windowsAnd hark 'Twas the shriek of the screechowl which nests in the tower above  ALICE  having locked the folding doors  Ah 'twas a sad day for me when I heard of the dear  Lady's loss Look at that bed LadyThat very bed was hers  F PHIL  Was it so Oh ho  ALICE  How often have I seen her sleeping in that bedand oh how like an angel she looked when sleeping I remember that just after Earl ReginaldOh Lord didn't somebody shake the curtain  ANG  Absurd It was the wind  ALICE  I declare it made me tremble Well as I was saying I remember just after Earl Reginald had set out for the Scottish wars going into her room one morning and hearing her sob most bitterlySo advancing to the bedside as it might be thus"My Lady" says I with a low curtsey "Isn't your Ladyship well"So with that she raised her head slowly above the quilt and giving me a mournful look  Here unseen by  Angela  who is contemplating  Reginald  's portrait  Father Philip  lifts up his head and gives a deep groan  ALICE  Jesu Maria the devil the devil the devil  This incident is borrowed from "The Mysteries of Udolpho" but employed very differently In the Romance it brings forward a terrific scene In the Play it is intended to produce an effect entirely ludicrous    Exit  ANG

 Stay daughter stay If you run I can never overtake you  ANG  Amazement Father Philip  F PHIL  The very same and at present the  best friend that you have in the world Daughter I came to save you  ANG  To save me Speak Proceed  F PHIL  Observe this picture it conceals a spring whose secret is unknown to all in the Castle except myself Upon touching it the pannel slides back and a winding passage opens into the marble hall Thence we must proceed to the vaulted vestibule a door is there concealed similar to this and after threading the mazes of a subterranean labyrinth we shall find ourselves in safety on the outside of the Castlewalls  ANG  Oh worthy worthy Father quick let us hasten Let us not lose one moment  F PHIL  Hold hold Not so fast You forget that between the hall and vestibule

dare you trot about the house at this time of night propagating such abominable falsehoodsOne comfort is that nobody will believe you Lady Angela's virtue is too well known and I'm persuaded she

hear how it happened We were in the Cedarroom together and while we were talking of this and that Lady Angela suddenly gave a great scream I looked round and what should I see but a tall figure all in white extended upon the bed At the same time I heard a voice which I knew to be the Countess Evelina's pronounce in an hollow tone "Alice Alice Alice"three times You may be certain that I was frightened enough I instantly took to my heels and just as I got without side of the door I heard a loud clap of thunder and the whole chamber shook as if tumbling into a thousand pieces  F PHIL  Well done AliceA very good story upon my word It has but one fault'Tis not true  ALICE  Ods my life Father how can you tell any thing about it Sure I should know best for I was there and you were not I

NayCome not near meOffer not to embrace me  ALICE  I embrace youLord Fellow I wouldn't touch you for the universe  F PHIL  Was it for this that you still flattered my person and declared that nothing

squeezed my lefthand tenderly placed a sackposset in the rightHeavens how deeplaid were your plans of seductionBut mark me tempter In vain has the soup been salted the  ragout seasoned and the pepperbox shaken with unsparing hand My virtue is proof against all your culinary spells the fairness of my innocence is still unblemished and in spite of your luscious stews and savoury hashes I

for me be a greater cause to love him Am I not branded with scorn Am I not marked out for dishonour Was I not free and am I not a slave Was I not once beloved and am I not now despised What man did I tender my service would accept the negro's friendship What woman did I talk of affection would not turn from the negro with disgust Yet in my own dear land my friendship was courted my love was returned I had parents children wife Bitter thoughtin one moment all were lost to me Can I remember this and not hate these white men Can I think how cruelly they have wronged me and not rejoice when

pressed my hand and my face was covered with her kissesOh then then how I trembled with disgustAnd now blue dismal flames gleamed along the walls the tombs were rent asunder bands of fierce spectres rushed round me in frantic danceFuriously they gnashed their teeth while they gazed upon me and shrieked in loud yell"Welcome thou fratricideWelcome thou lost for ever" Horror burst the bands of sleep distracted I flew hitherBut my feelingswords are too weak too powerless to express them  SAIB  My Lord my Lord this was no idle dream'Twas a celestial warning'twas your better Angel that whispered"Osmond repent your former crimesCommit not new ones" Remember that this night should Kenric  OSM  KenricOh speak Drank he the poison  SAIB  Obedient to your orders I presented it at supper

What though he quit me and betray my secrets Proofs he cannot bring against me and bare assertions will not be believed At worst should his tale be credited long ere Percy can wrest her from me shall Angela be mine AngelaOh At that name all again is calm in my bosom Hushed by her image my tumultuous passions sink to rest and my terrors subside into that single fear her lossI forget that I have waded to her arms through blood forget all save my affection and her beauty  SAIB  You forget too that her heart is another's Oh my Lord reflect on your conduct while it is yet time restore the poor

distracted from thy armsOh how I hate thee SleepFriend of Virtue oh how I dread thy coming  This scene will doubtless have reminded the Reader of  Clarence's Dream Richard's Dream  c But it bears a much closer resemblance to the  Dream of Francis in Schil  er's Robbers  which in my opinion is surpassed by no vision ever related upon the Stage Were I asked to produce an instance of the terrific

moments which divide us Dost thou too chide the slowness of Time's pinions which moved so swiftly when we strayed together on the Cheviot HillsMethinks I see him now as he paces the Conway's margin If a leaf falls if a bird flutters he flies towards it for he thinks 'tis the footstep of Angela Then with slow steps and bending head disappointed he regains the fisher's cottage Perhaps at this moment his eyes like mine are fixed on yonder planet perhaps this sweet wind which plays on my cheek is freighted with the sighs of my LoverOh sigh no more my PercySoon shall I repose in safety on your bosom soon again see the moon shed her silver light on Cheviot and hea its green hills repeat the carol of your mellow horn  SONG  HOW slow the lingering moments wear  Ye hours in pity speed your flight  Till Cheviot's hills so fresh and fair  Again shall meet my longing sight  Oh then what rapture 'twill afford  Once more those scenes beloved to see  Where Percy's heart first told its Lord  He loved the Lass of low degree  No sounding titles graced my name  No bounteous kinsmen swelled my dower  But Percy sought no highborn Dame  But Percy sought not wealth or power  He sought a fond a faithful

Osmondwas the partner of his pleasures the confident of his cares The latter sprang solely from his elder brother whose birthright he coveted whose superiority he envied Yet his aversion burst not forth till Evelina Neville rejecting his hand bestowed hers with her heart on ReginaldThen did Osmond's passion overleap all bounds He resolved to assassinate his brother  when returning from the Scottish wars carry off the Lady and make himself master of her person by forceThis scheme he imparted to me he flattered threatened promised and I yielded to his seduction  ANG  Wretched man  KENR

world  PERCY  Oh there is no danger Motley My followers are not far off and will join me at a moment's warning then fear not for me  MOTL  With all my heart but permit me to fear for myself We are now within bowshot of the Castle The archers may think proper to amuse us with a proof of their skill and were I to feel an arrow quivering in my gizzard probably I should be much more surprised than  pleased Good my Lord let us back to the fisherman's hut  PERCY  Your advice may be wise Gilbert but I cannot follow it Angela  s escape may be discoveredshe may be pursued and in need of my assistance Then counsel not my retiring my fears of losing Angela are too strong the flame which burns in my bosom too ardent  MOTL  I'm sure no flame burning in your bosom can give you so much pain as an arrow would give me sticking in mine and as to your fears of losing the Lady I'd bet mine of losing my life against any fears in Christendom  PERCY  How Gilbert Have you not promised to stand by me to the last Did you not say you could die in my service with pleasure  MOTL  Very trueBut Lord if a man was always taken at his word the world would soon be turned upside down When a polite gentleman begs you to consider his house as your own and assures you that all he has is at your disposal he'd be in a terrible scrape if you began knocking down his walls or requested the loan of his wife or daughtersNo no SirWhen I said that I should die in your service with pleasure I intended to live in it many long years since to tell you the truth from a child I had always a particular dislike to dying and I think that with every hour the prejudice grows strongerGood my Lord let us be gone Ere long I doubt not  PERCY  Hark Did I not hearNo She comes notHeavens should the Friar's plot have

Sancho makes nearly the same observation upon sleep  But that not being my situation the present object of my desires is a blazing woodfire and Venus would look to me less lovely than a smoking sackpossetOh when I was in love I managed matters much better I always paid my addresses by the fireside and contrived to urge my soft suit just at dinnertime Then how I filled my fairone's ears with fine speeches while she filled my trencher with roastbeefThen what figures and tropes came out of my mouth and what dainties and tidbits went in'Twould have done your heart good to hear me talk and see me eatand you'd have found it no easy matter to decide whether I had most wit or appetite  PERCY  And who was the object of this voracious passion  MOTL  A person well calculated to charm both my heart and my stomach It was a Lady of great merit who did your Father the honour to superintend his culinary concerns I was scarce fifteen when she kindled a flame in my heart while lighting the kitchen fire and from that moment I thought on nothing but her My mornings were passed in composing poems on her beauty my evenings in reciting them in her ear for Nature had equally denied the fair creature and myself the faculty of reading and writing  PERCY  You were successful I hope  MOTL  Why at length my Lord a Pindaric Ode upon her grace in frying pancakes melted her heart She consented to be mine when oh cruel Fortune taking one night a drop too muchpoor dear creature she never got the better of itI wept her loss and composed an Elegy upon it which has been thought by many persons of great judgment not totally destitute of taste and sublimity It began thus  Baked be the pies to coals Burn roastmeat burn  Boil o'er ye potsYe spits forget to turn  Cindrelia's death  PERCY  Peace

Strive thy faith to save  Bend thy fixed glance on bliss beyond the grave  Hush guilty murmurs Banish dark mistrust  Think there's a Power above nor doubt that Power is just  FINIS  TO THE READER  MANY erroneous assertions have been made respecting this Drama some that the language was originally extremely licentious others that the sentiments were violently democratic and others again that if Mr Sheridan had not advised me to content myself with a single Spectre I meant to have exhibited a whole regiment of Ghosts To disprove these reports I have deviated from the usual mode of publishing Plays as performed and have printed mine almost verbatim as originally written Whether it merited the above accusations the reader has now had an opportunity of judging for himself I must just mention that the last line of the Piece is altered and that in the Second Scene of the Fifth Act  The Friar  was made to stick in the doorway whereas he now makes his exit without difficulty  Other charges however have been brought against me on better grounds and I must request the reader's patience while I say a few words respecting them To originality of character I make no pretence Persecuted heroines and consciencestung villains certainly have made their courtesies and bows to a British audience long before the appearance of  "The Castle Spectre"  the  Friar  and  Alice  are copies but very faint ones from  Juliet's Nurse  and Sheridan's  Father Paul  and  Percy  is a mighty prettybehaved young gentleman with nearly no character at all I shall not so readily give up my claim to novelty when I mention my misanthropic  Negro  He has been compared to  Zanga  but Young's Hero differs widely from what I meant in  Hassan Zanga  's hatred is confined to one object to destroy the happiness of that object is  his sole aim and his vengeance is no sooner accomplished than he repents its gratification  Hassan  is a man of violent passions and warm feelings whose bosom is filled with the milk of human kindness but that milk is soured by despair whose nature was susceptible of the tenderest affections but who feels that all the chains of his affections are broken for ever He has lost every thing even hope he has no single object against which he can direct his vengeance and he directs it at large against mankind He hates all the world hates even himself for he feels that in that world there is no one that loves him  Lorsque l'on peut souffrir sure que ses douleurs  D'aucun mortel ne font jamais couler les pleurs  On se desinteresse à la fin de soimême  On cesse de s'aimer si quelqu'un ne nous aime  But though Hassan's heart is changed by disappointment and misfortune that heart once was feeling and kind nor could he hate with such inveteracy if he had not loved with extreme affection In my opinion this character is not  Zanga's  but this I must leave to the public decision I may however boldly and without vanity assert that  Motley  is quite new to the Stage In other plays the Fool has always been a sharp knave quick in repartee and full of whim fancy and entertainment whereas  my  Fool but I own I did not mean to make him so is a dull flat good sort of plain matter of fact fellow as in the course of the performance Mr Bannister discovered to his great sorrow  That  Osmond  is attended by  negroes  is an anachronism I allow but from the great applause which Mr Dowton constantly received in  Hassan  a character which he played extremely well I am inclined to think that the audience was not greatly offended at the impropriety For my own part I by no means repent the introduction of my  Africans  I  thought it would give a pleasing variety to the characters and dresses if I made my servants black and could I have produced the same effect by making my heroine blue blue I should have made her  In the  Friar  's defence when he most ungallantly leaves  Angela  in the cavern to shift for herself I can only plead the necessity of the case Stay where he was he could not go he must at any rate I trundled him off in the best way that I could and for the sake of the public I heartily wish that way had been better With regard to his not meeting  Osmond  in his flight a little imagination will soon conquer that difficulty It may be supposed that as he lost his way in coming he lost it again in going or that he concealed himself till  the Earl  had passed him or that he tumbled down and broke his neck or that hedid any thing else you like better I leave this matter entirely to the reader's fancy  Against my  Spectre  many objections have been urged one of them I think rather curious She ought not to appear because the belief in Ghosts no longer exists In my opinion this is the very reason why she  may  be produced without danger for there is now no fear of increasing the influence of superstition or strengthening the prejudices of the weakminded I confess I cannot see any reason why Apparitions may not be as well permitted to stalk in a tragedy as Fairies be suffered to fly in a pantomime or Heathen Gods and Goddesses to cut capers in a grand ballet and I should rather imagine that  Oberon  and  Bacchus  now find as little credit to the full as the  Cocklane Ghost  or the Spectre of  Mrs Veal  Never was any poor soul so illused as  Evelina  's previous to her presenting herself before the audience The Friends to whom I read my Drama the Managers to whom I presented it the Actors who were to perform in itall combined to persecute my  Spectre  and requested me to confine my Ghost to  the GreenRoom Aware that without her my catastrophe would closely resemble that of the  Grecian Daughter  I persisted in retaining her The event justified my obstinacy  The Spectre  was as well treated before the curtain as she had been illused behind it and as she continues to make her appearance nightly with increased applause I think myself under great obligations both to her and her representative  But though I am conscious that it is very imperfect I shall not so far offend my own feelings or insult the judgment of the public which has given it a very favourable reception as to say that I think my Play very bad Had such been my opinion instead of producing it on the stage or committing it to the press I should have put it behind the fire or throwing it into the  Thames  made a present of it to the British  Scombri  Still its success on the stage great enough to content even an author does not prevent my being very doubtful as to its reception in the closet when divested of its beautiful music splendid scenery and above all of the acting excellent throughout Without detracting from the merits of the other performers to all of whom I think myself much indebted for their respective exertions I must here be permitted to return particular thanks to Mrs Jordan whose manner of sustaining her character exceeded my most sanguine hopes and in whose hands my heroine acquired an importance for which she was entirely indebted to the talents of the actress  M G LEWIS  In a few Days will be published  By JOSEPH BELL No Oxford Street THE FOURTH EDITION  With considerable
