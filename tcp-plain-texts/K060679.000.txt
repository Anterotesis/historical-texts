GOSS'MOUR  and  MILKAH  lying on banks in mournful attitudes  SONG  GOSS'MOUR  _FROM  KENNA'  s groves ah see  How fast the beauties flee  While we our fav'rite moan  No more shall moonlight sport  Revive the Fairycourt  Alas our  ORIEL's  gone  Shall our peerless queen remain  Still oppress'd with doubt and pain  She whose visage pure and bright  Emulates the snowdrop white  She whom trim in regal state  The daisy fails to imitate  She whose dancing on the green  With such wonder has been seen  That her graceful revelry  Peering Morn unwillingly  Hath interrupted Oh shall she  Sunken deep in misery  Never learn what is become  Of her boy of rosy bloom  Her muchlov'd ORIEL lawful heir  To KENNA's grove and regal chair  MILKAH  Soon may OBERON untie  The twisted knot of witchery  Which TITANIA's sense hath bound  So many moon  in sleep profound  Wond'rous means which for her sake  The monarch was compell'd to take  To calm the outrage of her grief  And give her wounded mind relief  So frantic were her cries so wild  When first she miss'd her lovely child  GOSS'MOUR  This night soon as in floods of sleep  Mortals 'gan their senses steep  Our little fav'rite gentle PUCK  Frequent herald of good luck  Wander'd forth in duteous love  To search the mazes of our grove  Ne'er to return but to relate  Some tidings of our ORIEL's fate  MILKAH  Or I mistake or PUCK and you  My GOSS'MOUR if report say true  Have sometime pass'd the summerday  On beds of flow'rs in am'rous play  GOSS'MOUR  Oft beneath the primrose shade  Softlysighing hath he stray'd  Breathing such sweet vows of love  As fill'd with incense KENNA's grove  Hence is ROBIN well inclin'd  To soothe and please his GOSS'MOUR's mind  And sure his errand well hath sped  For here he scuds with nimble tread  Enter  PUCK  SONG  PUCK  Quick and light as the air  In and out here and there  Have I tript till I'm weary to death  Lend lend me your hand  For I hardly can stand  Lackaday I am quite out of breath  GOSS'MOUR  My gentle ROBIN I am griev'd  Here rest thy head till thou'rt reliev'd  Has aught beside the length of way  Which thou tonight hast measur'd say  Alarm'd thee or thy steps misled  Or caus'd thy foot awry to tread  Or pois'nous thing or pest unclear  Tainted KENNA's wholesome air  Trust me I joy to see thee safe  PUCK  Ha haI cannot chuse but laugh  How credulous and blind you are  Mortals in love scarce blinder are  So oft as through the livelong night  Thou'st known me range in airy flight  Or DIAN's stated circle run  Ere forty minutes well were done  By 'hest of royal OBERON  Or for thy sake in blaze of day  The butterfly with amorous play  In many a variouswindingring  Have chac'd to steal his painted wing  Of new device and beauty rare  To form a robe for GOSS'MOUR fair  By loyalty or love inspir'd  When hast thou known thy ROBIN tir'd  Or when did any pois'nous thing  Or noisome pest on vapour's wing  Wafted through these windings clear  Come the fairyessence near  GOSS'MOUR  Mischievous elf no more shalt thou  To GOSS'MOUR breathe thy faithless vow  No more in lilypersum'd vale  Repeat thy soft deceitful tale  Can mortals more perfidious prove  To win then mock a maiden's love  Away  PUCK  I'm goneelsewhere to tell  What I have learn'd of ORIEL  Going  MILKAH  You shall not think to cheat us so  This moment tell us all you know  Running after him  PUCK  List thenSuch wonders shall ye hear  As never enter'd fairyear  Through all this flow'rembroider'd grove  Where elves and fays delight to rove  Through bush through brake through lowly dale  Through dank through dry o'er stream through vale  By ev'ry odourbreathing bed  Where violets nod the purple head  By ev'ry bank of gurgling rill  Embellish'd with the daffodil  Ev'ry mead and every mound  Where cowslips harebells paint the ground  Ev'ry bower where jess'mines fair  Softly scent the ambient air  Or luscious woodbine or flush'd rose  Round a lavish fragrance throws  Nay ev'n each narrow crankling nook  Where playful trills the scantiest brook  And ev'ry shrub where rude mishap  In tender rind hath made a gap  MILKAH  Thou hast explor'd  PUCK  All these throughout  Your ROBIN has not set a foot  SONG  GOSS'MOUR  Faithlessthrough some distant grove  Then thy steps have stray'd  Thou hast breath'd thy vows of love  To some happier maid  Henceforth in my bosom's grace  Never shalt thou find a place  PUCK  Sweetestthrough no distant grove  Have my footsteps stray'd  No nor have my vows of love  Tempted other maid  In thy  ROBIN  's love and grace  Thou alone shalt find a place  Together  GOSS'MOUR  In thy  GOSS'MOUR  's love and grace  c  PUCK  In thy  ROBIN  's love and grace  c  GOSS'MOUR  O forgive if jealous fear  Finds an easy passage here  PUCK  Come a sweet amends I'll make  Our ROYAL MISTRESS is awake  The cause of all your grief and care  Where ORIEL is why fled from here  She knows and all will soon approve  Attentive now in duteous order move  While I with magic sounds awake the grove  SONG  I  Elves elphins fairies sayes  Where'er in sportive maze  Ye haunt the winding stream  And paint the poet's dream  Quick to  OBERON  resort  Speed ye to the fairycourt  CHORUS  Quick to  OBERON c  II  And ye from violet blue  Who steal the silver dew  With which like di'monds sheen  Ye deck your lightrob'd queen  Quick to  OBERON  resort  Speed ye to the

royal lord no more  I murmur at thy will The pleasing dreams  Children of gentle sleep wherewith my mind  Was pregnant and thy reasons since have eas'd  My doubts my terrors O consider sir  They were a mother's feelings and forgive 'em  OBERON  Nor deem so lightly of a father's love  As to suppose a slavish race of men  Or tributary thrones had gain'd my boy  No To our matchless island gorgeous  In victory's rich trappings and a people  Endow'd with birthright freedom is he yielded  And ev'ry bliss attend it  The last  CHORUS  repeated within  CHORUS  Quick to  OBERON  resort  Speed we to the

Attend your monarch's words Your ORIEL  Is not for ever lostAn age or so  Small space in fairylife he spends with man  To glad a glorious nation to procure  Love honour and esteem by virtuous deeds  And blessing others to be blest himself  For this dear purpose ORIEL foregoes  The sweets of KENNA's grove whilom the seat  Of purpled majesty and thence belov'd  Of fairyfoot My trusty PUCK thy looks  Seem big with new enquiry Is there aught  Thou wishest yet to know that may to thee  Give ease and glad my peopleSpeak undaunted  PUCK  High monarch of our happy race  Do us yet the mighty grace  To say in what part of this isle  Deserv'dly honour'd with thy smile  In what rich grove or flow'ry way  Does our muchlov'd ORIEL stray  OBERON  Not westward far of this our KENNA's court  Short trip to fairyfoot a seat appears  Close by whose verdant verge THAMESIS fair  Checking his silver stream with tardy pace  Glides ling'ring on enamour'd of the scene  From flow'renamell'd banks soft Zephyr steals  The fragrant sweets and ev'ry blushing bough  Hangs pendant with POMONA's choicest store  Groves grottos temples lawns promiscuous rise  As art with nature vied to deck the scene  Destin'd to soothe a monarch's patriot cares  When empire's fate and proud parade of courts  Yield to the comforts of domestic ease  And social solace of connubial joy  Amid these scenes by HYMEN ever bless'd  Your ORIEL clad in guise of mortal prince  Crowns the fond wishes of a happy pair  Pleas'd in his insant mind to see the bud  Of ev'ry grace that dignifies a throne  Give early promise of a people's love  PUCK  Thanks gracious OBERONyet deign  Certain means and marks to shew  How in mortal dress and mien  We may our darling ORIEL know  SONG  OBERON  I  By the amberlocks that flow  Down his temples white as snow  By the dimples in his cheek  Temper sweet that sweetly speak  By the lips of rip'ning red  Rivals of the muskrose bed  By the thousand smiles that dance  In his blooming countenance  Where ye see such beauties blow  There shall ye your darling know  II  By truth's ray that even now  Dawns upon his infant brow  By the look erect and clear  Honour's early harbinger  By
