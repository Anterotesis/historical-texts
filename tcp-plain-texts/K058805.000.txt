IT may not be amiss to premise as an introduction to this work that the following pages were not made public with a design of instructing men early bred to husbandry but to give Gentlemen who may think proper to use a certain quantity of land either for amusement or convenience such an insight into the nature of farming as will enable them to check the negligence correct the ignorance or detect the imposition of servants  There is not a more healthful rational or more pleasing amusement in rural life than agriculture nor does any one thing  independent of profit from sale yield a family more conveniencies or in greater plenty than a farm but it must be a satisfaction at the same time not to pay more for those conveniencies than necessary To those gentlemen who seldom examine their accounts or look into the application of their money this treatise will be useless they take servants with good characters and to their honesty they trust the whole Few bailiffs with a stated salary are much in their master's interest they crop the land perhaps and possibly keep it in good condition but the expence with which it is done is no part of their consideration A farmer's chief gains arise from making his land produce as much as possible and doing the business at as little expence as he can For this purpose he takes the advantage of seasons attends to his team that his horses are in health kept so without waste of provender and that they work a certain number of hours he takes care  to employ no hands but what are absolutely necessary gives no more for labour than his neighbours sees that his labourers fill up their time work their stated hours and neither rob him of nor waste his property he gets his harvest properly in whilst the weather is fine buys in his stock at the best hand and gets a market price for all he sells But does every gentleman's bailiff do this No His master's eye is seldom upon him his account is scarce ever looked at and he is found more in the interest of the employed than his employer I have seen twenty men in a hayfield and about a hayrick when half the number would have been sufficient they have stood in one another's way and half their time they have been idle instead of taking advantage of the dry time and working till dark they have quitted at six and left the rick to the mercy of the weather This a farmer  never  suffers and it is by this and other things that gentlemen  lose by farming But would they occasionally look into the business themselves and none but such can ever expect to profit by it they would very soon find their account in it and it would fill up many a listless hour  To gentlemen fond of riding without an object in view even riding becomes irksome but were they when in the country to ride about their farm every fine day each gate opening with a latch were they to examine at such times the improvement of their cattle the condition of their team and implements the state of their fences the cleanness of their grounds the richness of their meadows and the luxuriance of their crops new pleasures would daily rise before them and their morning's saunter would be delightful To such persons experiments occasionally made upon an acre or two of ground under their own immediate direction would throw new  lights upon husbandry be useful to the world and amusing to themselves but to make such experiments of real use minutes should be kept of every circumstance respecting them the nature of the soil the number of ploughings and harrowings the quantity and kind of manure the quantity of seed sown the time of sowing the weather the cultivation till harvest the time of cutting the produce when threshed and every other particular and comparing these at home with former or similar crops would afford no unpleasing amusement in a wet morning But whilst I am studying the interest of others I am forgetting my own I am finding employment for  gentlemen  who may  dread  employ and under a notion of recommending my book I am thus perhaps destroying its success For  any  useful employ to men of fortune in the present age is irksome to think of They  waste  the  important hours and  fritter  away their life in  trifles  Since the following pages were written the price of grain is considerably reduced four years ago wheat was sold at fourteen pounds a load now it will scarce fetch eight The prices however here stated are nearly the average  CONTENTS  CHAP I  OF Soils  Page  CHAP II  Of the Team  Page  CHAP III  Of Wheat  Page  CHAP IV  Of Barley  Page  CHAP

property and among others who take it up under a principle of amusement or gain the Author of this work flatters himself the following pages will be very acceptable to the Public particularly as the many treatises on farming hitherto published are so crowded with  theory new experiments and speculations that instead of being useful to country gentlemen they have ever misled them and after the trial of a number of years have shewn that farming to them instead of producing profit has brought on a considerable loss The fact in short is this such books have induced gentlemen to try new methods and follow them in all the round of idle speculation when they should have pursued that plain method which every farmer follows Thus have they attributed their loss to the dishonesty of servants which in fact arose from their want of knowledge in the business of farming whereas had they never looked into such books of agriculture as are now extant but depended even on the little knowledge and experience of an honest country servant bred to the plough they would have reaped an advantage though not equal perhaps to the farmer who has followed the business his whole life  To correct these mistakes and point out that method of agriculture which every experienced farmer pursues is the design of this Work and the Author persuades himself that if his instructions are observed and attended to there is no land in this kingdom but will while it amuses the cultivator yield him a considerable profit He does not wish to deter gentlemen from trying experiments or following new methods but if they wish to profit by farming such experiments or new methods must be made only occasionally The loss of a few pounds on one acre of land is of no consequence but when that one is extended to some hundreds it discourages the enquirer and leads him to attribute that to the dishonesty of servants the poorness of the soil or bad markets which is wholly owing to experimental enquiry  CHAP I OF SOILS  THE first thing every systematic treatise on agriculture teaches the husbandman to enquire into is the nature of his soil Whether this consists of marle or limestone more or less salts or oil the  pabulum  of plants to the plain practical farmer is immaterial all that is essential for him to know is whether the land be stiff or light and whether it is best adapted to the growth of wheat or barley Of this he may instantly judge by his eye or he may learn it from a sight of the crops the information of the neighbours or the trial of one year and if even reduced to pick up his knowledge from the last an indifferent crop for one year cannot ruin him  Every husbandman knows that rye barley turneps and clover will thrive best in a light soil oats beans and wheat on a stiff or strong one that strong clayey land will require winter fallows to break and pulverize the soil and that light sandy or gravelly land will want summer fallows to destroy the weeds that horsedung is the best manure for all kinds of land but that clayey land will receive benefit from light dressing though it be ashes or even sand and that light lands may be helped even by a dressing of clay  I would however advise every person commencing farmer or taking a farm to make some little enquiry into the nature of his land as he will never jump into a farm hastily without some consideration I would recommend it to him to take a view of the crops just before harvest the season before he is to take possession of it  If the land be poor the crops of wheat or oats will be thin the straw short and the ears small if rich the crops on the contrary will be thick the straw long and the ears large and in many places it will be lodged that is instead of the straw standing upright it will be fallen on the ground a sure sign of the strength and richness of the land If the wheat be full of poppies it denotes a light poor soil if full of thistles a strong good one I mention this last observation from what I have too often seen that of a farm's being generally foul when a tenant quits it Indeed a new occupier has little to expect but to lose money for the first three or four years till he has cleared his land and brought it into good heart so apt are old tenants through a mercenary principle to overcrop it and neglect to clean it towards the expiration of their lease unless he takes it immediately out of the hands of some gentleman who has valued more the  neatness of his grounds than any profit he might derive from them By such a view of the different fields he will be able to form a good judgment of the nature of the soil and what kind of crops it is best suited to If it should so happen that he cannot have this view of the farm the season before he may collect the information from such neighbours as are no way interested in his taking it or let him take a spade and examine the depth and nature of the mould by digging in one or two of the furrows in each field The greater depth of mould there is the better the land and the more capable of improvement If the earth be a black crumbling mould it cannot be bad Foulness and poverty are to be got the better of but it is very difficult and expensive to increase the depth of the upper staple of the land that is the earth in which the corn grows With respect to the strength and richness of the soil thistles among the weeds are no bad proof of it  It should be the new comer's business to enquire what dressing has been laid upon the different fields and when and what course of crops they have borne that is what grain they have been sown with since the last fallow and he should determine his future crops accordingly If he goes this way to work and crops his land agreeable to the courses pointed out in this work he will have no reason to apprehend much loss particularly if he has got a good honest carter with some little experience who can plough and sow the land well and who will not rob his master himself of the grain when threshed nor suffer the threshers to do it Such a man may be easily procured in every part of the kingdom for countrymen in general accustomed to hard and homely fare and unacquainted with the luxuries of life have few temptations to dishonesty and being void of art and cunning if a little attended to by their master will not readily find  the way to injure him Gentlemen who as I have before observed are obliged to entrust more to their servants than farmers do have been apt to attribute their loss in agriculture to them which in fact has arisen only from their trying experiments pursuing every fanciful scheme laid down in books of husbandry and expending more in the  beauty  and  neatness  of their lands than is necessary If gentlemen wish to profit by farming they must content themselves with tolerably clean fields and good saving crops but if they study to decorate their farms by clipped hedges large branching trees that impoverish the headlands c belt walks and the like they must expect to suffer in the product Lands will require a certain number of ploughings and harrowings and a certain quantity of manure and will well pay for such labour and expence but if that certain quantity is exceeded the money is thrown away for land may be made to  produce as good a crop with five or six ploughings as if ten were bestowed upon it and as to dressing every farmer knows it may be over done for rank luxuriant wheat will be lodged with the first rain or wind and the crop then is irrecoverably lost A certain degree therefore of cleaning and manuring is necessary and will be attended with advantage but beyond that degree the crop will not answer the tillage  CHAP II OF THE TEAM  ANOTHER principal matter that has misled many in their calculations of farming is want of attention to the expences of a team Few gentlemen in commencing farmers begin with more than fifty or sixty acres of land what is called a small farm Upon such a quantity of land I defy any but a working farmer to be a gainer he who works upon his farm himself and saves the expence of a servant and who occasionally goes with his horses to jobwork ploughs and harrows for other people who may now and then stand in want of assistance or employs his team on spare days in carrying coals timber manure c for such as will hire him for three or four horses will nearly  consume the whole produce of a farm of fifty acres unless the land be very rich indeed  Light soils may be ploughed with two or three horses but stiff lands will require four a sufficient quantity of land then must be occupied to find full employ for such a team in order to pay the farmer for his toils This team will cultivate about one hundred and twenty acres of arable land and as in most farms there is some meadow some upland grass and some coppice we may reckon a farm of one hundred and fifty acres of land not too much for a team of four horses a man and a boy Other servants need only be hired occasionally We will now consider the expences of such a team But let us first estimate the value of the necessary farming implements that we may be able to rate their annual decline in value as part of the expences I shall not be very nice or exact in these estimates as the difference of a  pound or two in yearly expences is of little moment and as very accurate calculations would unusefully swell the size of this tract but I shall set them down from minutes I have taken and estimates I have made from such minutes for my own curiosity for many years  The price of labour and the first cost of farming implements will be found to vary a little in different counties but not so much as to make the difference of the aggregate sum of any consequence Our enquiries are not about shillings but sums of greater moment  It will be necessary then for the cultivation of a farm of one hundred and fifty acres to have as follows     £  s  d  One waggon value about        Two carts        Two ploughs        A roller        Two large harrows        Four smaller ones of two sizes        A winnow        Two fill harnesses and three leading ones and four halterbridles about        Two load of or forty sacks        Eight dozen of hurdles        A corn screen sieves measures and other sundry articles for even money about                 Four horses about                    £  s  d  The annual decline of value of the implements above upon an average will be found to be about  per cent  that is        That of the horses about  per cent        Farrier and shoeing of four horses        Blacksmith's bill about        Wheeler's        Collarmaker about        Carter  s    d per  week and a lodging in the farmhouse This man will buy and sell and do all the business of the farm        Boy's wages  d per  day        Grease for wheels about        Two acres and a half of clover value  l  an acre will keep four horses seventeen weeks if cut green and carried into the stable to them that is                    £  s  d  Brought over        During the time of eating green meat  Some farmers contend that it is not necessary to give them any oats while at green meat but if they are worked hard they will require oats  one halfpeck of oats a day is sufficient for each horse say seven quarters and a half at  s per  quarter        Seventeen loads of hay will keep them the other thirtyfive weeks at  s per  load        During these thirtyfive weeks they should have one peck of oats each day  per  horse at  s per  quarter that is about thirty quarters and a half        Annual average expence  c        The above expences being as necessary on a farm of sixty acres as upon one of  one hundred and fifty it evidently appears that no profits are to be gained upon so small a farm for after the rent seed and harvest are added to the amount there must remain a considerable loss even supposing the land on an average to bring in four pounds an acre which considering accidents and the necessity of letting it lie idle for a fallow once in five or six years it cannot be supposed to do But let the same team do the work of a farm of one hundred and fifty acres which with management it is capable of doing and it will yield a considerable profit as I shall hereafter shew If gentlemen keep coachhorses which they can occasionally spare to plough or harrow a few acres of ground and cultivate no greater quantity of land than will maintain those horses and yield a product which they can consume in their own families they will certainly find their account in occupying  even thirty or forty acres as I have fully evinced in a Pamphlet I published some years ago called  The Way to be Rich and Respectable  where it will appear a person may live as well and make as good an appearance in the country for four hundred pounds ayear as others do that spend a thousand pounds having no such land but those who keep horses and servants merely on the principle of farming must not expect to profit unless they occupy as much land as will employ those servants and horses fully  Some have recommended the use of oxen instead of horses as eating no corn and of course less expensive indeed oxen do not decline in their value as horses do being after four or five years labour generally fattened and young ones broken in in their stead nor are they liable to so many disorders as horses if an ox falls lame he is only fattened the sooner whereas  a lame horse is of little value Again also there is some little saving in harness and attendance when their work is done but when it is considered that it will require three if not four oxen to supply the place of two horses and of course that a greater quantity of hay is consumed the object saved is not so great especially when some farmers contrive to save the decline in value of their horses by doing their work with colts and selling them at five years old for coach horses By this method their teams have turned out very profitably to them the only necessary care being not to work them too hard To effect this end the team should consist of mares and a stonehorse should be kept on the farm With gentle work a mare may be kept in harness till she drops her foal and worked again a few days after with her foal by her side  Being now on the subject of the team I will take the opportunity of recommending iron axletrees to waggons and carts instead of wooden ones the first expence indeed will be more each iron axletree costing about five pounds whereas the price of a wooden one is not above seven shillings and sixpence but I aver it is cheapest in the end as they are not so liable to break and will last out two or three waggons and add to this the principal motive of my recommending them a waggon with iron axles is of considerably less draught than one with wooden axles I am persuaded it is the difference of one horse in four that is three horses will draw as much with iron axles as four would with wooden ones and the reason is evident To make wooden axles sufficiently strong their diameter must be twice as large as iron ones the friction therefore and of course the draught must be proportionably greater  CHAP III OF WHEAT  WHEAT being the farmer's staple crop to which he looks for his chief profit he will pick out the cleanest fields for this grain and such as are most in heart The land is generally fallowed and manured for a wheat season or the grain is sowed on the breaking up of a clover lay which has lain a year or two in that artificial grass or after a crop of turneps fed off with sheep the land for which has been dressed or manured the spring before  The time for sowing this grain is from the beginning of September to the end of November but the prime season as appears from a number of experiments made  by Mr Young is between the first week in September and the last in October Farmers in general wish to get their seed into the ground by the th of September they seldom think of sowing earlier indeed if they are to break up a clover lay or sow it on a turnep field they cannot well get their land ready sooner as in the first case they lose the clover feed in the month of September and in the other the turneps are of little value much before Michaelmas If therefore they have much wheat to sow and but one team to prepare the ground necessity often obliges them to be sowing wheat in the month of November If the land be wet by postponing it so long they may chance to lose the seedtime from an impossibility of working the ground but if the land be dry the end of November will not be too late to produce a tolerable crop though the nearer it is sowed to Michaelmas the more we may expect to reap  Next as to the quantity of seed  per  acre This is in some measure determined by the cleanness and richness of the land If sown upon a fallow or after turneps two bushels an acre is the general allowance if on a cloverday rather more than two bushels about two bushels and a half In a variety of experiments on clayey and gravelly soils Mr Young asserts that two bushels and a half is the most advantageous quantity for an acre of land but farmers in general seldom sow more than two bushels or two bushels and one peck  To prevent the wheat being black or smutty it is seldom sown without being first steeped some hours in brine made of water in which as much salt has been dissolved as will cause an egg to swim when taken out it is dried with powdered lime and then sown This custom took its rise from an accident near the seaside where a quantity of wheat was sowed that by the  wreck of a vessel had been some time under water It was observed that the year in which this happened was remarkable for smutty corn and the wheat in that neighbourhood particularly so whilst the produce of that grain that had been soaked in salt water was totally free from the least appearance of smut Many farmers lime the seed only by pouring boiling water on lime and when cold soaking the seed in it  The seed once sown it requires little care till harvest all that is necessary is to keep it dry by waterfurrowing to weed it in the spring if foul which should be done if possible before the end of April lest it should be too much grown and if its colour be a very dark green and the crop should be too luxuriant owing to the strength and richness of the land to turn a flock of sheep into it in dry or frosty weather in the month of March and let them eat it down close to the ground If  this precaution be not taken there will be danger of its falling or being lodged by wind or rain before harvest and the crop in a great measure spoiled When eaten down by sheep it will branch out afresh and the stems will be shorter and less liable to fall  Should the wheat in March or April bear a yellow hue it is a sign of its not being healthy its colour should be a dark green In wet land it will look yellow but as the dry weather approaches it will regain its colour In wet soils the narrower and higher the ridges or lands lie the better what ploughmen call two or threebout lands are best in this case there being a greater quantity of furrows the water will of course run off the readier and the lands lie drier In harrowing such lands after the corn is sown the horses should go in the furrows this will leave the ridges round and smooth In sowing  wheat some plough it in and others only harrow it in like other grain the chief advantage of the first way is to preserve it from the birds Wheat may be sown with advantage with or after the second ploughing  If in the month of February or March the crop appears thin weakly or unhealthy top dressings of wood ashes maltdust or soot may be occasionally sown over it at the rate of about thirty or forty bushels an acre which will greatly improve it but this is an additional expence of twenty shillings an acre neither of these articles being the produce of the farm  Change of seed is another material object of attention to which farmers pay a due regard that their wheat may be large and heavy nay some kinds of grain will produce a greater quantity than others The chief point with farmers in general  is not to have seed if they can help it from their own neighbourhood but to procure seed from light land to sow on a stiff soil and seed from stiff or strong ground to sow on light soils and great care should be taken that the seed sown be clean from the seeds of weeds otherwise you contribute to the foulness of your land  In a word though wheat is a grain that will not pay great expences in the culture it should either be sown on land in good heart or not at all It is a crop that should ever succeed ameliorating ones  viz  beans clover tares turneps c or a summer fallow and thrives best on stiff ground  The following is an estimate of a general saving crop upon an acre of ground As I suppose the farm to consist of one  hundred and fifty acres of land and the aggregate expences of a team with wear and tear of implements c to be as before stated  l    s  I shall rate the team at twenty shillings an acre The account then will stand thus  EXPENCES     £  s  d  Rent tythe and taxes suppose        Team c        Two bushels of seed at five shillings        Additional labour in carting and speading manure and waterfurrowing        Brining        Weeding this not always wanted        Reaping this sometimes less or more        Carry over           £  s  d  Brought over        Additional labour in carrying in        Threshing two quarters and a half and cleaning at three shillings        Binding one load and a half of straw                 PRODUCE     £  s  d  Two quarters and a half of wheat at forty shillings        One load and a half of straw at fifteen shillings                 Expences        Neat profit        Land may be brought into such heart as to produce four or five quarters of wheat an acre at least such land as that I am now speaking of which I suppose to be worth fourteen or fifteen shillings an acre In this case every additional sack of grain will produce an additional profit of eighteen shillings and six pence In the above estimate I have also rated the price of wheat very low it is much oftener at a higher price than otherwise  Wheat will receive a greater advantage from dressing if the manure be not laid on immediately for it that is if the wheat crop follows an ameliorating crop of turneps tares c for which the land had been previously dressed for by this method the great strength of the manure which makes the wheat rank is taken off by a prior crop  Besides dressing and fallowing land for tares or turneps will produce a luxuriant crop that will overshadow the land so much as to smother any weeds carried on by the dressing and of course the succeeding wheatcrop will be cleaner as I shall shew in the chapter on Tares  In looking over a field of wheat if it be free from smutty ears the straw pretty thick on the ground and not lodged the ears in general large and the crop tolerably even that is the ears of corn throughout the field rising every where from the ground to a level with each other it may be pronounced a good crop  Wheat is ripe and fit to reap when the straw is every where yellow and the ears hang down If the wheat sheds in reaping it should not be cut in the middle of the day but mornings and evenings when  the dew is on and that part of the field should be first cut that was first sown  There are two or three sorts of wheat but I do not know that one will produce a more profitable crop than another  If after wheat is reaped and bound there should be much wet the grain will be apt to shoot particularly in the bands In this case it should be opened dried and rebound  Between three and four hundred sheaves an acre provided the ears be large and heavy is a very good crop Some acres will yield from seven to eight hundred sheaves where there is so much straw there is generally less corn Some acres again if the land be poor will produce scarce two hundred sheaves  If fifteen sheaves produce a bushel of wheat it is a very good crop In this case an acre that gives three hundred sheaves will yield two quarters and a half or half a load of wheat  CHAP IV OF BARLEY  BARLEY thrives best on a dry light soil and requires three ploughings at least if not four with a good deal of harrowing to bring the land into fine and proper tilth The stiffer the soil the more ploughings are necessary If the spring be fine and dry there is time to make the ground tolerably clean for this crop which is seldom sowed till about the beginning or middle of April Barley is frequently sowed and with success in the last week in April but Mr Young from a variety of experiments which he made assures us that provided the land be dry and can be got into good tilth early enough which may be if barley follows  a summer fallow the most profitable time of sowing it is the end of February or the beginning of March as such early sowing will produce a third more at harvest This may be true and worth the trial but farmers in general sow it late that they may have an opportunity of bestowing much labour on their land and making the soil as fine as possible Besides such late sowing often enables them to crop that land that was sown with turneps the year before for sheepfeed and which cannot be eaten off perhaps before the end of March  The quantity of seed usually sown is four bushels  per  acre and this is universally allowed when clover is sown with it to produce the best crop at harvest Indeed when barley is sown without clover five bushels of seed will produce more grain at harvest than four but not in the proportion of five to four so that four  bushels of seed  per  acre is certainly the proper quantity to sow with or without clover As in the case of wheat the richer the land is the less quantity of seed is requisite but that diminution of quantity is not great perhaps a peck or half a bushel  Change of seed is here as necessary as in wheat crops Care should be taken to sow such as was raised on a different soil to that on which we mean to sow it and that the seed be clean from the seeds of weeds  The general method of cultivating barley is to sow the land with clover after the barley is in the ground as will be shewn when we speak of clover at present I will give the reader an estimate of a tolerable saving crop of an acre of barley alone but of such with which clover is mixed  EXPENCES     £  s  d  Rent tythe and taxes

Four quarters at twentyeight shillings        Straw one load and a half at fifteen shillings                 Expences        Neat profit        Seven quarters of barley is no uncommon crop for rich light land but from stiff land you may not reap more than four or three When this is the case barley should not be sown I have valued the straw at the price it would sell for but this should be eaten by cattle and consumed upon the farm for the sake of the manure But admitting this to be done it is still of equal value to the farmer  From a continuance of dry weather after the seed is up the blade will sometimes look sickly and wear a yellow hue but a little rain will soon recover it  The same indications that declare wheat to be ripe will pronounce barley to be fit to cut  Care should be taken that barley with which clover was sown should be turned  after it is cut sufficiently to dry the clover before it is either housed or stacked otherwise it will heat in the mow and spoil the grain Good barley as good wheat may be known by the grain's being heavy large fair plump and sweetsmelling not dry discoloured small shrivelled or musty  CHAP V OF OATS  THIS grain though not so profitable as wheat or barley from the great number of horses kept in this country is a part of every farmer's crop Indeed though the produce is not of equal value with a crop of barley or wheat there is more certainty in the price it will fetch at market for I never yet observed so great a variation in the value of oats as in that of the other two If a farmer finds his land rich and able to bear crops for years together that will turn out more profitable than oats he would be imprudent to grow any In this case it will be his interest to buy all the oats he wants rather than grow them to a disadvantage  but if his soil be a hungry one and he cannot procure sufficient manure he will do right to have a crop of oats occasionally for oats will grow almost in any land though here as in other crops the richer the earth the greater will be the produce From four to five quarters of oats on an acre of ground is a very good crop where the land has been even dressed but as farmers are apt to take three or four crops from their ground after it has been fallowed and manured before they sow it with oats they seldom get more than three or four quarters an acre whereas were they to sow the seed on ground in good heart the produce of an acre would be from seven to ten quarters  There are several kinds of oats such as are known by the names of Essex Poland Scotch and Black The first two are a largebodied grain the Scotch  are small white oats such as are given to horses and the black are also good horsecorn but of a black colour The Essex and Poland thrive best in light barley land the Scotch and black on strong wheat land The fairer plumper and shorter the body of the grain is the better the quality and to make it marketable it should not be brown or mowburnt or have any musty smell Such as is designed for seed should be well cleaned from the seeds of any weeds  Clover may be and often is sown with a crop of oats but this is chiefly on stiff land where barley is never sown In light barley land farmers prefer the barley crop to sow their clover in because at that time the ground is cleaner and in better heart I shall treat of an oatcrop here as sown by itself without any mixture of clover or other grass  Farmers seldom plough more than once for oats tho' it would be better to turn the last year's stubble in before Christmas and the customary time of sowing them is in the month of March but a dry April is a better seedtime than a wet March Black oats will generally speaking admit of being earlier sowed than white ones  The quantity of seed generally allowed for an acre of ground is five bushels though Mr Young whose authority I have more than once quoted from his experiments asserts that the most advantageous quantity is from seven bushels to seven bushels and a half but it appears from his enquiries that the produce of six bushels does not exceed that of four bushels and a half more than about one bushel and a half which is just the extra quantity of seed so that his experiments prove no  more than that five bushels the customary allotment of all farmers is the most advantageous  The following is an estimate of a tolerable crop on an acre of ground

Expences        Profit        There is an additional expence in carrying the crop of every field to market which I have not mentioned before nor was it perhaps necessary now it being in itself but trifling  Plenty of straw in a crop of oats generally denotes plenty of grain but it is not always so in other crops  There is a critical time in cutting of oats if they are cut too soon before they  are ripe great part of the grain will not be threshed out if they stand till they are full ripe they are very apt to shed in cutting turning and getting in He who would preserve his good crop should as they ripen every day examine it and if he finds them easily rub out as he handles them should order them to be instantly cut It sometimes happens that one part of a field shall be riper than another when this is the case the riper parts should be cut in the mornings and evenings when the dew is on them the greener part not so liable to shed may be cut in the middle of the day The same care should be taken in turning them and raking them together after they are cut If they are stacked or housed before the straw is quite dry they will be apt to heat in the mow get a brown hue and a musty smell which will considerably reduce their value and if they are full ripe when cut and tumbled about in the  middle of the day half the crop will be left shed and scattered in the field  Should the straw of a crop of oats be so luxuriant as to fall or lodge it will receive less damage then a crop of any other grain We need not be apprehensive therefore of its being too rank  CHAP VI OF BUCKWHEAT  BUCK wheat or French wheat is a spring crop and frequently like tares and turneps sown merely as a manure to plow into the ground in order to prepare it for wheat It is a grain not commonly brought to market yet nevertheless of importance to the farmer as it will thrive in lands not in a proper condition for barley and will pay him well for sowing it in rich soils though the general opinion is that it flourishes best on poor lands But what is most worthy of consideration in this crop is that it need not be sown till the middle of May a circumstance very advantageous to such as occupy wet lands So that if the ground be not in very good  heart or it should turn out a bad season for barley sowing it is not an unpleasant thing to be able to reap from it a good crop of buckwheat Where barley is given to cattle buckwheat will answer the end as well and the straw if properly got in will turn out good winter fodder Wet summers are not so favourable for it as dry ones  The time to sow this grain is as I said before about the middle of May and the most advantageous quantity of seed  per  acre one bushel If the land by frequent ploughings and harrowings be made tolerably fine and the season be favourable there is little doubt of having a good crop  An estimate of an acre  EXPENCES     £  s  d  Rent  c        Team  c        Seed one bushel        Mowing        Harvesting  c

heart it is no uncommon thing to reap eight or nine quarters from an acre and at market it will generally fetch the price of middling barley  CHAP VII OF BEANS  BEANS thrive best in a strong stiff soil and few farmers sow them but in such ground There are several sorts of beans though seldom more than two are the objects of the husbandman's attention these are horsebeans for the food of horses and tickbeans for the food of hogs I have seen some fields of longpods which is a garden bean and I have myself sowed an acre or two more than once with broad Windsors and dwarf kidney beans but as these are out of the line of farming I shall not say more about them  Of the two sorts usually cultivated at large horsebeans require a stronger ground  than tickbeans There are two methods of sowing them some sow them broadcast on the ground and plough them in in one earth flat or plough the ground first into ridges then sow them broadcast and harrow them in and others set them bean by bean in a line with dibbers I have tried them both ways and scarce know which to give the preference to If they are sown upon a clover lay they certainly should be set that is pricked in bean by bean for as seldom more than one ploughing is given to a crop of beans the earth of a clover field when broke up is not fine enough that is not sufficiently pulverized to admit of their being sowed broadcast like other grain but if they follow a crop of turneps wheat or oats broadcast fowing will do very well  In sowing beans broadcast the expence of setting them which is done by women  and children is avoided and also a further disadvantage for though the distance from row to row is pointed out to them they are apt to set them too thick in the rows being paid in proportion to the quantity they set sevenpence or eightpence a peck which they get rid of as fast as they can nor watch them and talk to them as you will can you prevent their doing it this not only wastes the seed but too often injures the crop But then again on the other hand when sowed broadcast every part of the field may not be equally covered the land does not look so neat and there being a greater difficulty in hoeing them the men are usually paid sixpence or ninepence an acre extraordinary The quantity of beans sown and set is nearly the same in both ways About two bushels and a peck or two bushels and a half  per  acre The crop at harvest is rather in favour of setting than otherwise  but perhaps not sufficient to pay the extra expence  If drilling of crops be worth the attention of the farmer it is more so in beans and peas than in any other grain but even here setting them is a very good substitute and considering the expence of a drillplough which not one wheeler in twenty knows how to make or repair and not one ploughman in a hundred knows how to use I question whether setting is not equally cheap in the end I am sure it is less troublesome to the farmer Besides on stiff clayey soils where beans best thrive it is impossible to use a drillplough which is adapted only to loose light lands  The end of February or early in March is the customary seedtime for beans though many sow them so late as April  and some I have heard say put them in at or before Christmas From Mr Young's Experiments it appears that early in February is the most advantageous time but accidents will occasionally delay the sowing sometimes a week or a fortnight such as wet weather particularly where they are set by women and there is a want of hands to set them  The great advantage of a crop of beans to the land arises from the hoeing as such a crop must be always handhoed with a sixinch hoe once if not twice during its growth If the land be tolerably clean and the hoeing can be deferred till the beginning of May once may be sufficient but if after the first hoeing the weeds still get ahead and are likely to rise as high as the beans they must be hoed a second time If the land be in good heart and the beans grow away  strong after once hoeing they will get above the weeds and by their luxuriance keep them down and smother them As beans have a tap root and draw their nutriment chiefly from the lower staple of the ground and as they are hoed once or twice during their growth and of course the weeds destroyed farmers consider a bean crop almost as good as a summer fallow and will often sow wheat immediately following though I do not hold this to be good farming unless the land had been manured for the beans A master will be better able to judge whether they be clean hoed provided they are set in rows than in the broadcast method of sowing and in a broadcast crop it is as necessary to cut out beans with the hoe where they rise too thick setting them out at distances in the manner of turneps as it is to cut up the weeds To know whether this be properly done we must walk over every land  To judge whether a field of beans be good or bad we must examine how they are kidded for a good crop depends more on this than on the quantity of haulm If they are kidded all the way up from the bottom to the top and the kids in general contain five or six beans we may expect to reap largely but if otherwise the reverse A dry summer is not so good for beans as a showery one for in very dry weather the stalks are short and slender and the crop often blighted that is covered with a black fly in this case they must take their chance for rain only can recover them  They are seldom ripe enough to cut till September but the proper time may easily be known by examining them When the kids are black and begin to open at the end they ought to be cut and though throughout the field some of the kids be not so black as others this should not prevent  us for they will ripen and harden after they are cut by setting the sheaves upright and leaving them out in the field for a week or ten days If they are cut before they are ripe they will shrivel and if too ripe they will shed considerably in the cutting Should this last be the case they should not be cut in the middle of the day but in the mornings and evenings only when the dew is on them They should not be pulled up by the roots for you would thus carry a quantity of dirt into your threshing floor but cut off with a hook as they reap wheat  An acre of land proper for beans will produce with good culture from two quarters and a half that is half a load to five and six quarters but three quarters and a half or four quarters may be reckoned a very good crop Rather a greater quantity of tickbeans may be got from an acre of ground than horsebeans but horsebeans  bear always a better price so that the value of each crop will be much the same In purchasing beans particularly for seed care should be taken that they are hard and not shrivelled and the smaller the bean the better as there are a greater quantity in the same measure Beans will generally fetch a greater price after they have lain in the stack eight or nine months than if they are threshed out before Christmas as they are then harder and better for feed  The following is an estimate of an acre of horsebeans supposing them to have been set  EXPENCES     £  s  d

Expences        Profit        Where manure is laid on for any crop it will add something to the expence as an additional hand or two must be employed to fill the cart and spread the dung The price of spreading is generally one shilling  per  acre and one shilling or eighteen pence an acre may be reckoned for labour in filling  Mr Young tells us that from the experiments he made he finds that by sowing beans upon the same land year after  year each succeeding year will produce a better crop than the year before even though no dressing be put upon the land that where the first year produced only three quarters and a half the third year produced five quarters This he attributes to hoeing and destroying the weeds which was done three or four times in each year and the tops of the beans being cut off just as they were going to blossom It may be worth the trial on small spots of ground but is a thing never done by farmers  I hold trenchploughing to be good in the culture of beans where the depth of mould will admit of it as it gives the plant room to strike deeper than in the ordinary method of ploughing but I am no advocate for turning up the gravel or clay among the mould  CHAP VIII OF PEAS  PEAS generally flourish most in light dry sound land but tolerably good crops may be procured on cold brick earth loams or clays  There are various sorts of peas but those usually sown by farmers are white peas and hog peas the first is well known but of hog peas there are also two or three sorts grey dun blue  c  There being other crops that pay better than peas farmers generally sow them on poor land such as is grown foul and perhaps out of heart but like every other crop I am persuaded they would pay for a certain degree of cultivation but overdressing  would make the haulm grow large and rank and the crop will suffer by it Wet seasons are always prejudicial to peas for the above reasons peas are not always a part of the farmer's crop  In light land drilling them may be a good method as in that case if necessary they can be better hoed and a future crop also will receive a benefit from such hoeing but in strong stiff lands they must be sown broadcast Indeed sowing broadcast will all things considered produce a greater quantity at harvest than drilling and as it is attended with less trouble and expence upon the whole perhaps it may be as well if not better  The quantity sown on an acre of ground of the white peas is generally three bushels but Mr Young from his experiments finds that four bushels and a half of  white peas and five bushels and a half of hog peas are a more proper quantity for in wet seasons if a quantity of seed sufficient to stock the land be not sown a proportion of weeds will occupy their place and where farmers do not hoe their pease a thick crop is necessary to cover the ground and smother the weeds  The customary time of sowing is about the middle of March and that of cutting in August When they begin to ripen it will be necessary to station a boy in the field to frighten away pigeons and other birds otherwise they will carry away half the crop The same attention must be paid to the time and manner of cutting as was pointed out in the case of beans A good sample of peas is when they are not shrivelled but look large plump and fair  An estimate of an acre of broastcast peas  EXPENCES     £  s  d  Rent tythe

peas the land should undergo three or four ploughings and many harrowings to bring it into as fine a tilth as possible  Drilled peas like beans should be twice hoed which will be an additional expence of five shillings an acre but a future crop will be benefited by it  CHAP IX OF TARES  TARES are cultivated for three or four purposes Some sow them for the seed others to cut green for horses and other cattle some make the haulm into hay for winter feed and others feed it off with sheep and lambs in the spring In whichever way however the crop is consumed though it seldom forms part of a farmer's regular course of crops it is nevertheless far from being an unprofitable one  There are two sorts winter tares and spring tares the first are a hardy kind and generally sown before or about Michaelmas to cut green for horses in the spring or stand for seed  If they are sowed in the month of August and designed for seed they will be fit to cut early in the month of August following after which there will be sufficient time to prepare the land for wheat or when the tares are carried off the ground it may be ploughed up and sown with turneps by which means two crops are produced from the same ground in one year  But the best farming is to sow them at Michaelmas or not later than the second week in October about two bushels or rather better to an acre and that upon land that has been fallowed and dressed from such fallow and dressing may be expected a very luxuriant crop that will rise above and smother every weed that might either be carried upon the ground in the dressing or not be destroyed by the fallow This crop should be cut for hay in the beginning of June when after two ploughings  the land may be sown with turneps and being eaten off by sheep at Michaelmas the ground is in the best order that can be for a crop of wheat as it will then be perfectly clean and in good heart for the dressing the sheep leave will amply compensate for the crop of tares which not being suffered to stand for seed will not draw the ground but leave it in the finest order Thus also two crops will be gained in one year without injuring the land  Whether spring tares are sown for hay or for seed the quantity of seed and time of sowing are the same As one great advantage in cultivating this pulse is bringing the ground into fine order for wheat or barley it would be well if the land were dressed for it and care taken to sow it early that there may be a thick crop sufficient to cover the ground and smother the weeds March is the proper time for sowing and  the quantity two bushels and a half  per  acre Once or twice ploughing will do for tares which should be rolled after they are well harrowed in They require no further trouble till harvest except cutting out the thistles if any should rise for every other weed a thick crop of tares will destroy and such is the advantage of a thick crop that if cut for hay they admirably prepare the ground for a crop of wheat breeding that putrid fermentation in the soil which renders it as fertile and as mellow as after the best fallow  If tares are designed for hay the time of cutting them is when they are in full blossom If they are left longer they draw the land too much and make not such good hay as when they are in the highest state of succulency Though some contend that the hay will prove heartier food if they stand to pod and the pods to fill that in this case horses eating such hay  will require less corn This I believe to be the case but I am a strong advocate for keeping the ground in good condition If the crop be got in without rain tarehay is better than any common hay but rain injures it a great deal  The following are the expences and profits of an acre made into hay  EXPENCES     £

must be very advantageous especially as they leave the land in better state than when they were sown Besides if they are not to be followed by a crop of wheat the land may be immediately ploughed up and sown with turneps which will produce an additional profit of near thirty shillings an acre as may be seen in the chapter of Turneps and leave the soil in fine state the next year for barley oats or any other spring crop  The following estimate supposes the tares to stand for seed  EXPENCES     £  s  d  Rent  c        Team  c        Seed as before        Weeding  c        Mowing        Getting

fairest calculation here is evidently a loss of eighteen shillings and two pence between the two profits which might have been avoided had the tares been cut for hay besides the injury the ground receives by a seedcrop and the loss of so much dung as cattle eating that hay upon the farm would have yielded An acre may possibly produce two quarters and a half which is an additional profit of about seventeen shillings but this is not in my opinion an adequate compensation for drawing and impoverishing the land  CHAP X OF TURNEPS  TURNEPS like tares is one of those ameliorating crops whose culture cleans the land and at the same time enriches it They thrive best in light soils but succeed tolerably well on stiff ones Very strong clays are the only soils in which they will not grow to advantage  Farmers consider a crop of turneps as a summer fallow and as the best preparative for either wheat or barley To obtain a good field of turneps they plow the land four or five times harrow it till it is as fine as they can make it and then dress it All this is done with the same view that I recommended tares viz to procure a  luxuriant crop that will smother the weeds which the dung carries into the field with it in order that the succeeding crop whether of wheat or barley may be clean and plentiful Besides as this crop is fed off by sheep the better it is the longer will it maintain a given number of sheep and of course the greater quantity of dressing such sheep leave behind them It is generally a losing crop for that year but the advantage hereafter reaped amply repays the loss  The most proper time to sow them is about midsummer or soon after so that if the spring be fine there is sufficient time to clean the ground Though we wait a week or two for it a dripping time is best for sowing for without some rain the seed may not grow in very dry seasons as soon as they are out of the ground the fly is apt to destroy them and when this is the case we have no other resource  than to harrow the land and sow it afresh If they escape the fly as soon as they put forth the rough leaf they should be handhoed with a nineinch hoe cutting them up where they are too thick and leaving them at about nine inches distance from each other About a month after they should be hoed a second time to destroy the weeds by this time they will be of sufficient growth to keep the weeds down and smother them They require no other care till they are either drawn for cattle or eaten off by sheep One pound of seed  per  acre is the quantity usually sown and as there are two or three sorts of turneps some prefer the greenround and others the taprooted as growing to a larger size In a tolerable good crop the average weight of an acre of turneps is about thirty or thirtytwo tons They rather improve in weight from December to January but decline in weight from  January to March In my neighbourhood where farmers have not a sufficient stock of sheep of their own they sell their turneps to those who have and the price of an acre varies in proportion to the quantity of feed there is from twentyfive shillings to forty shillings and they never think of disposing of their crop any other way Those who draw them to fatten cattle may possibly turn them to greater advantage Mr Young says double but as every farmer has not money to buy stock to fatten he is obliged to give up that thought and content himself with enriching his land by folding of sheep upon it For ten acres of turneps would require a stock of one hundred and twentyfour pounds in cattle to consume them  For curiosity let us see what is lost on an acre of turneps well sold  EXPENCES     £  s  d  Rent tythe and taxes        Team c        Filling dungcart and spreading suppose        Seed one pound

deducting ten shillings and sixpence the expence of the turneps from one pound fifteen shillings the price they sell for when we consider  that without this crop the land would have lain idle and when we take into the consideration the advantage the next crop or two receive from clean enriched land we shall have no reason to complain     s  d  In fatting lean stock a ton weight of turneps is worth about      In feeding lean stock about      In feeding sheep on the land      Stallfed cattle besides a rack of hay will daily eat in winter between a third and fourth part of their own weight in turneps  CHAP XI OF CLOVER  THE introduction of clover has turned out a great treasure to the farmer it being one of those crops that pays well for the tillage and at the same time enriches and ameliorates the land Its profits are reaped three ways being either fed cut for hay or suffered to stand for seed If the farmer has sufficient stock to eat his clover green or has money to purchase such a stock he will reap a double advantage by so doing for an acre of clover fed off green will maintain a given number of cattle much longer than it would if made into hay Besides as in this case it does not stand to flower it draws the ground less and the dressing left by the cattle is no inconsiderable advantage  If cattle are turned in in the beginning of June three acres of clover supposing these three acres if cut and made into hay to produce four loads and a half cut out of the rick will fatten and maintain nine horses and four cows for four weeks which at four shillings a horse and two shillings and six pence a cow  per  week amounts to nine pounds four shillings Now in this time they would eat six loads of hay worth twelve pounds or were these three acres cut and made into hay reckoning the hay at forty shillings a load and it is always five shillings less in value than a load of meadow hay and deducting ten shillings an acre for mowing making stacking thatching and binding it leaves a profit only of seven pounds ten shillings and should a purchaser require it to be carried ten miles such carriage would be two pounds five shillings and reduce the profit to five pounds five shillings But was such a first crop of clover for I  am now only speaking of the first cutting I say was such a first crop cut day by day carried into the stable or farmyard and given to horses or cows there it would turn out still more advantageous for it would maintain twenty horses for four weeks I speak this from experience which twenty horses in the same time would consume eleven loads of clover hay worth twentytwo pounds Here indeed the dressing is not laid upon the land but the horses would in that month if littered down with about seven loads of straw yield forty loads of dung which would dress four acres of land well a circumstance that would amply pay for cutting and carting home and carrying the dung out again upon the land Besides a team so kept upon green meat would require very little corn half the quantity would do an object of importance to the farmer  Let us take a second view of this  Three acres of clover fed off by cattle on the land  PROFIT

exhausted but exceedingly well dressed I have  reckoned nothing for labour in cutting as the carter and boy will do it nor have I brought straw into the account as the farm will produce sufficient litter that could not be sold beanhaulm fern  c  Nor have I here estimated the saving in the corn given to the horses which is considerable nor either rent or team these being equal in every case  Whilst I am upon the article of clover and mentioning the feed of it for cows I must not omit the danger of turning them in while it is young and high Cows are internally differently formed from horses a cow has not only a stomach but a paunch designed by nature as a receptacle for her food Here she deposits it for a while without mastication and when she has eaten sufficient she at her leisure brings it a second time into her mouth chews it and conveys it into her stomach where it is digested and carried off Clover  is a very loose vegetable full of air particularly when young and in showery weather and as the paunch has not the same digestive power with the stomach checking that fermentation that lets loose the air if she eats heartily of young clover and fills her paunch by drinking soon after when fermentation takes place and the air is let loose she will swell prodigiously and from such swelling the vital system will be impeded the circulation of the blood stopped and the animal will die in fifteen minutes If she has not filled herself too full driving her and hurrying her about will often relieve her but should she have overloaded her paunch and drank upon it there is no remedy but one which though severe is generally safe and effectual having had occasion to try it I speak from experimental knowledge it is that of making an incision with a penknife through the flank into the body of the paunch and introducing the pipe of a  funnel into the orifice thus letting out that air that otherwise would destroy the animal By keeping the hole open till the complaint ceases we remove the danger and by piercing the hide with an awl sowing up the wound and the application of a plaster it will soon heal The place to make the incision is in the fleshy part of the left side or flank at an equal distance from the short ribs the spine of the back and the hipbone it should be pierced till the air issues out freely Sheep are formed like cows of course the same caution should be taken with them But let the bulk of the grass be first eaten down by horses and there is no danger or it is said if they are not turned in while the dew is on the grass it may be done with safety  Clover is a fine thriving food for hogs where there is a pond in the field which they can always have recourse to I do  not know any better way of disposing of the crop But water is so necessary that without it it is in vain to think of it Any part of a field may be hurdled off with gatehurdles and the only trouble is taking good care that they do not break out Some are apt to think hogdung prejudicial but it is an erroneous notion Being very full of salts where the land is richly dressed with it the first crop may be rank but future crops will feel its effects for years I am of opinion that there cannot be more profitable husbandry than by purchasing sows forward with pig turning them into clover suffering them to pig there and continue with their pigs till they are three or four months old and then selling them for store An acquaintance of mine told me that having once five acres of clover a good crop with a pond in the field and well fenced in he purchased in May ten sows of the large breed ready to pig which cost him thirty  pounds that he turned them into this field about the middle of the month kept them there till the middle of September and then sold them that the ten sows brought him ninetyeight pigs which he sold for fifteen shillings each and the sows for two pounds ten shillings each that they folded the land like a flock of sheep and so richly manured it that it wanted no dressing for near twenty years After the clover he sowed it with wheat which was so rank as to fall and turn out of no value but the year following he sowed it with wheat again and had a prodigious crop  Supposing five acres under this management  EXPENCES     £  s  d  Rent tythe and taxes        Team c        Carried over           £  s  d  Brought over

enriching the ground  Clover in general thrives best on light barley land It is usually sown with the second crop after a fallow with either barley or oats but sometimes with wheat and the richer the land the better the crop After the barley or oats are sown and harrowed in they customarily sow the clover sometimes by itself particularly if it be designed for seed and sometimes mixed with artificial grasses for hay When sown it should be rolled If clover is sown with a wheat crop it should be put  into the ground in the month of March before the wheat is too high This is done by harrowing the ground sowing and rolling it The harrows will not damage the wheat But wheat is a crop that does not afford it sufficient shelter of course it is bad husbandry  All things considered it is much more advantageous to sow clover with a first crop after a turnep season or a fallow than with the second as is commonly done for the land being then clean and in good heart the crop will be considerably greater and the clover will stand a second year very well especially if in such second year ashes or a light dressing of dung be bestowed on it Indeed clover is one of those crops which will pay for very ample manuring but is at the same time liable to be injured by unfavourable weather a dry seedtime or a wet harvest In dry summers though the crop  be small it will weigh heavy and cattle will thrive on it better than when the crop is larger it being sweeter and fuller of nutriment  The quantity of seed sown on an acre of ground is generally from nine pounds to fourteen the average quantity ten pounds But Mr Young asserts from a variety of experiments that he made that in poor land twenty pounds and in clean rich land fifteen pounds an acre is the most advantageous quantity as in rich land the roots will spread more and leave less room for weeds or natural grass  There are several sorts of clover  viz  broad clover which bears a red flower the white Dutch which bears a white flower and the trefoil which bears a yellow one The first is what farmers generally sow as growing higher and producing a larger crop The white Dutch  and trefoil are better for laying down lawns and meadows as they will matt and grow thicker at bottom but they are not profitable to cut for hay There is also another species of clover called cowgrass from its being less liable to spring cows that feed on it This last though sown in March makes but little appearance till Midsummer and can be cut but once but yet grows to a great height and produces in general large crops  The profits of a crop of clover as I said before are reaped three ways by feeding it with cattle cutting it for hay or suffering it to stand for feed I have already pointed out the profits arising from feeding let us next see what it will produce when cut for hay and in this estimate I will suppose an equally good crop with that I considered before as fed  viz  to produce two loads and a quarter  per  acre at the two cuttings I mean two loads and a  quarter out of the rick for clover is a grass that will lose considerably in its weight by drying  An estimate of an acre  EXPENCES     £  s  d

but should hay be dear this crop would be more profitable  It should not be cut till it has done flowering and begins to decay at the bottom nor should it be overdried in the making  When designed for seed it should be first cut for hay and eight or ten days  earlier than when the second cut is made for the same purpose A seedcrop is a very precarious one A wet harvest will destroy it and if it does not flower well the quantity will be small The second growth generally determines the farmer in this matter If the herbage be large it should not be left for seed as it will be apt to fall before the seed is ripe and damage the crop When the herbage is short and blossoms full and large there is a good prospect of reaping a profitable harvest In this case it should stand till it is quite ripe

sixty to seventy pounds according to the size of the grain The smaller the seed if good the better and the heavier the bushel weighs  When a crop has stood for seed it will produce but a small crop of clover the next year it should therefore be ploughed up and sown with wheat Farmers in general say the ground is in as good heart for wheat after it has stood for seed as if it was cut for hay but I am of a different opinion When threshed the chaff and haulm if it may be called so will serve to fodder cattle in the winter  CHAP XII OF THE COURSE OF CROPS  THE succession of crops is a principal matter to be attended to Different plants draw different nourishment and from different parts of the land Those with horizontal roots from one part those with taproots from another Some require cleaner ground than others and some land in better heart Again some soils are better adapted to certain crops than others All this obliges the farmer to study a little the nature of his land and the method of cropping it and experience has taught him that it is most profitable after the ground has been well fallowed and cleaned to pursue the following method of cropping  On strong stiff lands either  Wheat  Oats and Clover  Clover  Beans or Wheat  Turneps or a  fallow  or Tares  Wheat  Oats and Clover  Clover  Clover  Beans or Wheat  Turneps or a  fallow  or Beans  Oats and Clover  Clover  Wheat  Peas  Turneps or a  fallow  Where the land is naturally rich or made so by ample and frequent dressings  a summer fallow may not be necessary which is designed only to rest the ground and destroy the weeds Dung naturally fills the land with weeds but a crop of turneps or tares will smother them and render it clean again for this reason I recommend dressing the land for turneps or tares in preference to wheat  Mr Young tells us that he has tried beans upon the same ground for three or four years successively and has every future year had a better and a better crop This he attributes to hoeing the land two or three times in the course of the summer There is no reason to doubt his veracity but it is not the common practice of farmers indeed where the soil is naturally rich where it has been dressed for wheat and the crop has been lodged from its luxuriancy farmers have sowed the same land with wheat again the next year and found their account in it for if land  be too rich for wheat it is apt to lodge with wind or heavy rains and be considerably damaged  On light soils the course of crops is varied such as follows  A  fallow  Wheat  Barley and Clover  Clover  Oats or Rye or Peas  A  fallow  again or Turneps  or A  fallow  Barley and Clover  Clover  Wheat  Oats or Rye  Peas  A  fallow  If the land be naturally poor the more it is rested the better of course the longer  it lies under clover the larger will be the crop that follows it Indeed as poor land is generally low rented laying it down in pasture is the most profitable way of farming it especially if dressing cannot be readily procured By feeding land is annually manured and enriched and at the same time pays no great tythes a circumstance very pleasing to the occupier where tythes are paid in kind Instead of a fallow once in six or seven years it will be found frequently necessary to let poor land lie a year uncropped once in three or four years for if in the farmer's phrase it be overdriven without a much greater quantity of manure than he generally has to bestow upon it it will often produce little more than the seed be the ground ever so clean  CHAP XIII ON THE PROFITS OF A FARM IN GENERAL AND GRASS LAND IN PARTICULAR  LET us now recapitulate the profits on the different crops I have mentioned and it will shew the fair advantage a gentleman may expect to reap from a farm of one hundred and fifty acres of arable land under good management As we shall take a view of seven successive years in the course of which a round of crops takes place it is immaterial whether we suppose the whole farm cropped the same year with the same kind of corn or with different sorts the produce at the seven years end will be the same  We will begin with stiff land on which the course of crops will be after a fallow Tares Wheat Oats and Clover  Clover Clover Beans Turneps     £  s  d     £  s  d  The profit of acres of Tares cut for hay at        is        Ditto of acres of Wheat at                Ditto ditto Oats at                Ditto Clover cut for hay at        In the chapter on clover I have pointed out that such a crop may be made to produce a larger profit than five guineas an acre but I have taken it here at a medium value          Ditto Clover fed at                Ditto Beans at                                     Loss on acres of Turneps sed off by sheep at s

s  by years and it will appear that a farm of acres will yield an annual profit of  l  but if the land be naturally poor and it be  necessary to make the seventh year a fallow instead of  l  loss on the turneps we must reckon the loss of rent and team which will be  l  this will make a difference of loss to the amount of  l  and reduce the  l    s  to  l    s  which divided by leaves the annual

tolerable good farm whether it consists of a light or a stiff soil will pay upon an average with good management forty or fifty shillings an acre provided the occupier holds sufficient land to employ his team fully  The nearer a farm is to a market and to the convenience of getting manure cheap the more valuable it is  Let me recommend it to every occupier of land whether gentleman or farmer to keep a regular account debtor and creditor not only of his farm in general but of every field in particular with a memorandum annexed of the time the seed was sown the harvest reaped the favourableness  or unfavourableness of the season the quantity of ploughings the land received the dressing given it and every other particular By a recourse to this at future times he will be able to ascertain the condition of his land and how far he proceeded on a good plan or fell upon a wrong one and of course whether he should pursue the same method in future or not By so doing his business will become an amusement and his farm not only be profitable but instructive  The following is a ruled paged for that purpose and a copy of such an account kept  REMARKS  EXPENCES  PRODUCE        £  s

the nature of the ploughing the time when and the number of ploughings  I would in the first place recommend it to every occupier of land to employ a very good ploughman one who knows how to plough and sow well and one who will not want watching A team of two horses in light and four in stiff land will plough an acre or more in the course of a day one acre is the customary allotment of a day's work and is generally performed in eight hours The team usually leaves work at two o'clock but it is better for the  horses in summer time to get to work at four or five and quit before the heat of the day  All that is necessary for a master to take care of is that his ploughman does not ride upon the handles of the plough but plough the ground as deep as the plough will effect it or as the upper staple or layer of the land will admit  Plants that have taproots as beans carrots  c  thrive best in deep earth which has induced many to trenchplough their land but for corn the common depth of five inches is preferable to deeper ploughing As I said before I am no advocate for turning up the clay or gravel and mixing it with the mould and for this reason that it will require a long series of tillage to bring such soil as is thus turned up into the same state with the surface and it is contrary to the general practice of husbandry  We are next to take care that the ridges lie handsome round and even In dry soils the ridges may be broad and flat but in wet moist ground the higher and narrower the ridges are the drier it will lie In wet clayey soils I have ever found three or four boutlands the best as in harrowing the horses may walk in the furrows and thus avoid poaching it The furrows between the ridges should when the work is done lie clean so that the water can run freely off and waterfurrows should be made in all depending places to carry it clean away into the ditches This cannot be well done but by the spade and men should be employed for the purpose for unless the crop lies dry it will turn out a poor one It is necessary therefore to drain all wet slanks for where the water stands the crop commonly fails For the same reason at the last ploughing in moist rising land the furrows should be up and down the hill but  in hungry burning soils it may be proper to leave the ridges across the hill in order to hold the water and the dressing which otherwise might in heavy rains be washed away  As to the time of ploughing this must be in some measure regulated by the weather for in wet soils there are times when the plough cannot go upon the land In stiff clays where a winter fallow is necessary to mellow and break the clods the stubbles should be always broken up in autumn but where winter fallows are not necessary autumnal ploughings may for want of time be omitted especially when the ground is designed for beans or turneps the next year Such a crop receiving no very great advantage from ploughing in autumn the stubbles may as well be left for the feed of sheep for autumnal stirrings are designed to destroy the roots of weeds by frosts and to pulverize the land  this is more necessary for barley or oats than for a crop that can be hoed as hoeing the ground will effectually destroy the weeds But in wet soils when such autumnal ploughings are given care should be taken to ridge up the land and waterfurrow it so as to lay it dry otherwise where we mean to do good we shall chill the land and do a great deal of harm  Farmers vary in their opinions respecting the number of ploughings on different soils In strong lands ill adapted to certain crops that thrive best in lighter ones as turneps clover barley peas  c  the more we pulverize the soil the better which cannot be done but by many ploughings rollings and harrowings and where we wish to summer fallow and clean the land from weeds it is only to be done by frequent stirring it but when we mean to sow it with such grain as delights in strong land  as wheat beans oats  c  many ploughings are not only unnecessary but may be injurious The same reasoning will hold good in light land provided it be clean one ploughing is better for wheat beans or oats than three but where it is necessary to clean the land as in fallows or turnepseasons if the farmer has time and can do it with his own team so as not to bestow more expence upon the land than it will pay he cannot well plough it too much  All that is necessary to say with respect to harrowing is that every farmer should have three pair of harrows of different sizes a large heavy pair for three or four horses a smaller pair for two horses and a less pair for one The great harrows follow the plough the next size pulverize the land and the small harrows are chiefly used for harrowing  in the seed The land being ploughed in order to clean it we cannot well make too much use of the harrows for it is our business to bring it into fine tilth and not suffer a weed to grow  If the land be not a strong clay seven or eight acres harrowed twice over in a place with the great harrows is a good day's work Smaller harrows should go three or four times in a place  CHAP XV OF WEEDING  IT having been observed that clean our land ever so well time will naturally foul it and that the carrying on of dung will contribute to such foulness whereever we find obnoxious weeds rise with a crop that cannot be hoed it should be handweeded by going up the furrows reaching across the ridges and pulling up such weeds by the roots for were they suffered to seed instead of one weed without a fresh fallow we should have the next year a thousand Catlock poppy docks thistles all should be clean pulled out and whenever we find the last even in the hedgerows they should constantly be cut down before they seed  we never can have a clean farm without for the seed of the thistle is winged and will fly with the least breath of air from field to field Weeding the crop has saved the necessity of many a fallow which is the loss of a year's rent and the annual expence of the team  Those who study the cleanness of their ground will take care to weed their dunghills from time to time and sow no grain but such as is free from the seeds of weeds  CHAP XVI OF HEDGING AND DITCHING  WHAT they call dead hedges are the customary fences in my neighbourhood and I apprehend this method of inclosing fields is very general throughout the kingdom except in counties where they have plenty of stone of which they make walls Gentlemen and opulent farmers who study more the neatness of their farms than the article of profit will plant their banks with quicks or white thorn Such a fence no doubt is beautiful secure when properly grown and if cut with sheers once or twice in the summer will last a great number of years but it is certainly an expensive one for besides the annual labour of clipping the farmer  loses the advantage he would otherwise receive in the spare wood which will supply his copper and his oven and let a quickset hedge be ever so good it is not impenetrable to hogs  Dead hedges are fences made by cutting the ragged rambling hedge close down to the bank repairing the bank by casting the contents of the ditch upon it driving in stakes between two and three feet long filling the lower part with bushes and weaving it to the top between the stakes with hazles or any pliable sticks of some length A man will complete four or five rods or perches of such a fence in the common way in the course of ten or twelve hours and the customary price with us is from three pence to four pence a rod and two shillings a hundred for the faggots he makes with the spare wood with the liberty of taking home a faggot worth two or three pence more each night on his leaving  work Such a fence with occasional mending will last five or six years till the wood in the hedge is sufficiently grown to remake it Making this fence is in fact attended with no expence as the faggots obtained at every such making are generally worth twice the value of the labour  If the adjoining ditch be sufficiently cleaned out to let the water pass freely the bank be smooth and tight and the hedge even and strong which may be known by putting our hand upon the top and shaking it in different places the fence is well made  CHAP XVII OF THRESHING  SOME farmers choose this business should be done by the day others by the quarter Those who are for the first mode give this as their reason that when men work by the day they generally do their work better being in no hurry to get it done whereas when they thresh by the quarter they seldom beat the corn clean out Those who are for the other mode argue thus if men thresh by the day unless the master's eye is constantly upon them they will waste their time and of course in the end he will pay more for his threshing than if the work was done by the quarter and as to not beating it out clean that is the master's business he must examine it and see that the business  be properly executed In most counties men wish to thresh by the quarter as by working hard and a greater number of hours than is the usual complement of a day's work they can earn more money in the course of the week This principle has made it difficult to find men to thresh by the day and indeed if honest men are employed I think it most pleasant both for master and man that the work be done by the quarter  Where a day's labour is rated at eighteen pence the following prices are generally paid for threshing        s  d     s  d  Threshing a quarter of Wheat  from      to      Barley              Oats              Beans              Peas              according to what the crop yields  After the corn is threshed out the cleaning or winnowing is paid for besides Two men and a boy will clean a load of oats or wheat in a day  Clover seed is from five shillings to six shillings threshing and cleaning  Drawing weighing and binding of wheat straw after threshed one shilling a load  CHAP XVIII OF MANURING  MANURING of land is of such importance to a farmer that he who omits it must never expect a good crop indeed it is the very life of husbandry and the cultivation of land cannot go on without it In the neighbourhood of great towns plenty may be had and at a very reasonable price but what are farmers to do who live too remote to enjoy such an advantage Where manure is not to be met with on the farm itself or in its vicinage a method must be contrived to make it and this can be done only by keeping as large a stock of cattle as the farm will admit of and by other modes which I shall point out  Stable dung is one of the best manures and if purchased where it  can  be purchased is worth upon the farm from five shillings to ten shillings a load ten or twelve of such loads is an ample dressing for an acre of land and will keep it in good heart if kept clean for five or six years To raise then the greatest quantity upon a farm from a given number of horses is the matter in question This is to be done by keeping them all the year round in the stable and littering them well in which case a horse will on an average make twentyseven or twentyeight loads which will manure three acres well but to effect this it will take four loads and a half of straw to each horse which if the farm will not supply should be purchased Suppose these four loads and a half to cost  l    s    d  and to produce twentyeight loads of dung the price  per  load will then be under half a crown Fern where it can be got is a tolerable substitute for  straw but a farm generally yields sufficient litter to make the purchase of it unnecessary The stubble of the fields might be mowed or harrowed up in frosty weather and stacked for the purpose  Farmyard dung is the next in quality and where cattle are foddered the winter through and the yard well spread with litter they will upon an average yield six or seven loads  per  head so that two cows will manure an acre Where cattle are stallfed for fattening two beasts will if well littered yield about twentythree loads of dung in the space of fifteen weeks  It should be a farmer's study to make a compost dunghill at every fieldgate For this purpose he should carry there all the manures he can pick up Cleanings of ponds or ditches chalk earth clay ashes the dung of hogs geese pigeons poultry  brickrubbish or any thing he can get such as the list below points out this if well mixed together with a little lime and turned once or twice in the year will turn out an excellent manure for grass clover or any other purpose But he should take care to keep such dunghills free from weeds  When land is dressed at the rate of ten cartloads  per  acre each cart should contain sufficient to make sixteen heaps as parcelled out in the field and one such heap should be allotted to and sufficient to cover one square rod of ground there being one hundred and sixty square rods in each acre But where the soil is in tolerable good condition eight loads  per  acre will be sufficient for wheat as ten loads of good dung may make the crop too luxuriant and occasion it to fall before harvest With eight loads one such heap  should be appropriated to rather more than a square rod of land  As the hedges shelter birds which often consume the crop and the corn under them from its warm situation is naturally drawn up weaker and taller than in more open parts of the field and of course more apt to be lodged farmers seldom dress the headlands of a field when they crop it with wheat  The following is a list of manures with the uses they are fit for most of which are easily procured in different places  Horse Dung  When fresh for cold stiff clays when rotten for all sorts of land  Cow Dung  Rich and cooling sit for dry sandy ground  Hog Dung  Ditto This is rather too strong of itself but is an excellent mixture for the compost dunghill  Dung of Sheep Rabbits Goats Deers c  Very warm good top dressing Folding a flock of sheep every night upon fallow ground is a good practice Sixty sheep will fold an acre in six weeks equal to ten loads of dung  Pigeons Dung  The hottest of most dungs good for the compost dunghill  Chicken Dung  For top dressing  Goose and Ducks Dung  Ditto Some think it spoils the grass because horses do not like to eat where geese have fed but this is owing to the strong salts in it Where geese take to sitting at nights in a farmyard if the place be daily littered and kept clean they will in the course of the summer make a great deal of dung  Human Dung  is of so hot a nature that it is fit only for the compost dunghill If rochlime be thrown into the necessary in January it will remove the offensive smell and dry it so as to make it spread  Human Urine  and  Urine of Cattle Dogs c  The same quality as their respective dungs and have this advantage that they do not produce weeds if mixed with as much or two thirds water it is a good top dressing to be sprinkled over land with watercarts Human urine should be daily thrown upon the dunghill and the drainings of such dunghills with the urine of cattle should never be suffered to run off from farmyards but if possible collected in reservoirs  Dead Animals  should be buried in compost dunghills  Blood  from the butchers A very strong manure it should be mixed with earth sand or sawdust for the convenience of carriage and then used as a top dressing for any land  Hornshavings bones hoofs of cattle bits of leather hair of animals feathers  and  woollen rags  Good top dressings for any land  Salt  Excellent top dressing for most lands Refuse salt is sold duty free for this purpose It should be sowed upon the land  Lime  A general manure for all lands stiff or light excellent to mix in a compost dunghill as it makes the mass ferment and rot  Chalk  Good for all soils eight or ten loads an acre Put some if possible in all compost dunghills  Marle  A general manure but excellent for dry sandy gravelly or light lands good even for mossy ground and clay if well dissolved Will make white clover come naturally Happy is the farmer who has a marlepit in his grounds  Sea Sand  For cold strong clays  Oyster shells  and  sea shells  ground fine For ditto  Sand  For stiff clays  Clay  For sandy land or when mixed with lime or ashes for most soils  Gravel  For stiff clays and boggy ground If full of large stones screen it  Lime rubbish  and  Brick rubbish  For ditto  Rotten wood  and  Saw dust Tanners bark Rotten leaves  and  Willowtree earth  For stiff clays  Wood soot Coal soot  and  Maltkiln dust  For cold stiff clays to

manure but if lime be mixed with every layer it will make it ferment and rot the sooner It should be made in a shady corner if possible or covered over to prevent the sun's exhaling the virtue of the dung it should as I said before be frequently turned and no weeds be suffered to grow on it  CHAP XIX MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS    MEADOWS  To make meadows or pastures flourish they should be cut for hay only once in two years the second year they should be fed  Soapboilers ashes which may be purchased for about three shillings a hundred weight will effectually destroy thistles in grass lands by mowing the thistles and sprinkling the ashes lightly over them    Cows  A milch cow will require an acre and three quarters of good meadow or two acres of indifferent pasture to keep her well from May to October or one acre and a half of clover green will keep  her twentythree weeks and enough will be left to keep two sheep six weeks She will eat when fed on hay forty pounds weight a day upon an average which for the winter six months is four loads and a half Straw and fifty pounds of turneps  per  day will keep her well before calving  Whether the farmer weans calves to sell them at three years old with calves by their sides suckles calves for the butcher or converts the milk of his cows into butter or cheese each cow will with management pay him about five pounds ten shillings or six pounds a year so that he may proceed the way that is attended with least trouble and most convenient to himself  N B  It will require the cream of between sixty and seventy quarts of good milk suppose sixtyfive to make five pounds and a quarter of butter which at nine  pence  per  pound is worth three shillings and eleven pence farthing whereas the same quantity of milk sold at one penny halfpenny  per  quart would yield eight shillings and three halfpence but in the first case the skimmed milk is left for hogs which may be fattened if they have plenty on that alone and in feeding of hogs skimmed milk will pay about one halfpenny a quart  In dairies where cheese is made butter is generally made of the wheycream and in dairies where butter is made a blue milk cheese is usually made of the wheycurd  In buying young cows with calf make choice of those with a fine long spreading small green horn fine and clear of leather under the chops with a good shoulder deep chested broad and well made behind a straight broad back full hips with short straight legs a walk open and stately a  thick skin broadribbed with a good milk vein and udder and large teats Their age may be known by their horns A cow throws off the tip of her horns which is called shedding them at three years old at four years a ring or wrinkle is seen round each horn near the base and every future year adds a fresh ring Thus two rings denote that she is five years old three rings six years and so on  In buying storeheifers take care they are not bulled before you buy them A sure token to know they are bulled is from their having wax in their teats which may be brought out by drawing them between the fingers Observe also the barren under the tail if there is a drop hanging at it which generally gathers dirt depend upon it she is bulled    Sheep  To such as wish to keep sheep the following estimate will be acceptable     £  s  d  Fine large ewes with lamb may be bought in at Michaelmas at about twentytwo shillings each which in the July following will sell again for        The lamb will then sell for        The wool of the two shorn before sold will sell for about                 Deduct the first cost        Leaves profit        It will take an acre of grass to fatten five sheep but where grass is not plentiful they may be fed on stubble till Christmas then on turneps till Mayday next on rye and then on clover till sold No meadow will do for sheep in the winter that is wet enough to let them sink up to the first joint of their legs it will rot them  An acre of turneps will feed one hundred sheep for ten days or about eight sheep from Christmasday to Mayday  Sheep require a large range of pasture two acres and a half of grass and two and a half of stubble be they ever so bare will keep a sheep all the winter till March  Twelve pounds weight of hay will keep twenty sheep and their lambs a week  An acre of turneps will keep forty sheep three weeks as much as they will eat to fatten them  Dung of sheep when folded upon land for the richness of the manure is equal in value often to the profits arising from the sale of them Threescore sheep folded every night will manure an acre of ground well in the space of six weeks    Calves  A yearling calf will eat about five pounds or six pounds of hay in  the course of the night by way of fodder in winter  i e  half a load in six months To make them grow they ought to have the best hay  Calves may be weaned with very little milk by the following method  The first eight days after they are calved they should suck the cow They should then be taken from the cow and the next eight days fed with new milk the next eight you may give them three parts new milk and one part haytea mixed made by steeping the best hay in hot water and letting it stand till it is cold the eight following days give them half new milk and half haytea the next eight threefourths haytea and onefourth milk and after this nothing but haytea till they will drink water During this time they should have a little fresh hay put daily before them to tempt them to eat and  in the last three weeks they should be turned out into grass that they may learn to feed One cow will thus wean several calves Calves so weaned will thrive well and grow but not equal in size to those that run with the cows all the summer    Feed of Cattle  The greater extent of ground cattle have to range in the better Thus one field of ten acres will fatten or keep more cattle than two fields of five acres each    Stubbles  To make the most of stubbles turn geese into those of oats and pigs into those of beans each must have water to have recourse to or they will not thrive Where there is no pond place a trough or two One month in an oatstubble will fatten geese well    Weight of Wheat c  A bushel of wheat weight sixty pounds standard  eight gallon measure when ground into meal and dressed into flour gives fortyfive pounds one ounce of flour and twelve pounds of bran which when baked will yield fiftyeight pounds and a half of bread  Note  Twelve ounces of yeast and four ounces of salt to half a bushel of flour  A bushel of good wheat nine gallon measure will weigh seventy pounds  CHAP XX ON THE PRICE OF LABOUR  THOUGH the price of labour differs a little in most counties the following prices in the county of Surry may lead gentlemen to judge of its value in

rather out of the line of farming but the work being calculated for the use of country gentlemen such may occasionally have timber to sell and to such the method of measuring it may be acceptable  Timber is paid for by the cubical foot and to get at the exact dimensions they take the girth or measure the circumference in the middle of the body of the tree between the root and the part where it forks or branches off Should there be a swell in the middle the buyer is at liberty to take the girth in any place nearer the root  The girth thus taken four inches are allowed for rind and the remaining number of which the girth consists must be  first multiplied by itself the product in inches must then be multiplied by the number of feet of which the length of the body of the tree consists and this product being divided by the cubical inches in a foot gives the true cubical feet in the tree  EXAMPLE  What are the cubical feet in a tree feet long whose girth is inches Answer as below feet inches  The top of the tree is generally given to the purchaser for cutting it down and carrying it away  All under inches in girth is accounted top and not timber  Where there is a fork above inches in girth one of the prong pieces only is reckoned in the length  Fifty solid or cubical feet is called a load  No part of a tree that is not found is measured into the length  Gunter's sliding rule is that by which timber is measured This rule with a book of explanations may be bought at any mathematical instrumentmaker's     s  d     Crabtree is worth s a foot or      a load  Peartree about d a foot      a load  Elm is worth about      a load  Cherrytree is worth a shilling a foot           Oak ditto but is the more valuable according to the bend of the timber as it will serve for shipwork  Every country carpenter knows the price of timber which varies according to the situation of the place and distance to be carried  Forty yards of bark feet and a half high set up against poles is called a load and is worth about  s  or  s  The price of barking about  s  a load  FINIS
