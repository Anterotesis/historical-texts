 DIBDIN's SELECTED SONGS  A COLLECTION OF  SONGS  SELECTED FROM THE WORKS OF Mr DIBDIN  YET STILL AM I ENABLED TO BRING UP IN LIFE'S REAR  G Pen  LONDON  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY HIM AT HIS WAREHOUSE NO STRAND OPPOSITE THE ADELPHI  DEDICATION TO WILLIAM DAVIS ESQ  Sir  If ever dedication had a legitimate motive this has  The recollection of a friend's having witnessed the first dawnings of my poetical and musical ideashis kind partiality to themhis friendship and liberality in promoting a scheme for my benefithis handsome conduct in forgetting that at the instigation of unprincipled men I believed him to have been unfaithful to his promises In fine the variety of instances in which he has proved himself such a friend as no man but myself could ever boast of  These not only point out the most perfect propriety in my making an acknowledgment of my obligations but would also mark me as very unworthy of them if I neglected to seize so becoming an opportunity of inviting the public to bear testimony to my high sense of such kindness  You Sir are the friend thus described The facts I have spoken of exist And as I slatter myself you will allow that ingratitude makes no part of my disposition it cannot surprize you that I endeavour to do you common justice  So well however do I know you that you will wonder I should conceive it necessary to mention those kindnesses as a favour which you conferred for your own gratification  I beg leave nevertheless to be excused if I put in my claim for a little gratification too for as nothing ever gave me more pleasure than this proper addressthe spirit of which I beg leave to assure you is us pure  as honour and the letter as sincere as truthso I know nothing that could have been a severer mortification to me than to have been prevented from the satisfaction of thus telling you how truly  I am Your highly obliged friend And very grateful humble servant C DIBDIN  Strand  April  PREFACE  So many opinions have been hazarded by cavillers on the subject of the following songs that it would be almost a tacit acquiescence in the folly ignorance and absurdity of such opinions were I to do myself and the public so much injustice as to let this opportunity pass without giving them their merited notice  Were I disposed to pleasantry I might say with my Irishman that  "the proper notice would be no notice at all"  and indeed were it not for the sake of simple truth and common justice such calumniators might as well pass unregarded for envy is as natural to dunces as hunger and what should they seek to satisfy but the cravings of their appetites  As however there is something seriously material in attending to whatever in the slightest degree regards the public I shall go a little into this business  if it be only to shew how tiny and ineffectual are the yelpings of these literary curs who like true mongrels never open but to do mischief  It is remarkable that throughout my whole public career I have been nibbled at the heel by these mongrels of the muses these slinking snarlers who the reverse of the dogs that guarded the fane of Diana fawn upon vice and cherish every thing but virtue  When I composed the music of the Padlock the cry was that I employed some Italian for fifty pounds to do that of which I was incapable I smiled with contempt at the rumour and the public very soon did me justice  After this I had the temerity to write for myself The villany of such an action was unpardonable and it was immediately resolved to brand me with an aspersion as false as it was invidious Here I was obliged to assert my claim to a public hearing and the consequence was the town chose to allow that I  had as much right as any other person to the privileges of a subject and the feelings of a man  This terrible disappointment to the snarlers awed them into a kind of sulky growl which has never since broke out but very partially and as petulance and soreness generally interpret every thing the wrong way and defeat their own ends so the malignity of their sarcasms have not been more remarkable than their folly They have attributed my sea songs to men who knew no more of nautical terms than an English sailor does of art or hypocrisy they have made more blunders in detecting my Irish songs than the songs contain themselves and in the investigation of my hunting songs they have been perpetually at fault  A friend of mine one evening dropt in at a coffeehouse where a number of these literary jurymen were holding an inquest over my murdered reputationHe humoured the jest and before he had finished proved to the satisfaction of every one present that  Poor Jack was a posthumous work of Dr Johnson that the Race Horse was written by the jockey who rode the famous Flying Childers and that Blow high Blow low was the production of Admiral Keppel who dictated the words to his secretary as he lay in his cot after the memorable battle of the twentyseventh of July waiting for the French to try their force with him handsomely the next morning  But the mischief of it is these poor devils cannot discern that all they do to injure me gives me real consequence The public are always sure to take up a man at whom the shafts of rancour are levelledIf his efforts be nothing more than inoffensive he is secure of protection in favour of his intentions if meritorious they know too well their own dignity not to rank him according to his deserts  To that public I would make a solemn declaration that I am the sole author of every thing this book contains but that they too well know the hue of truth  to need an elucidation of it by any light I can place it in  As however I do not wish to crush this verminon the contrary I would have them crawl and nibble for vermin are as necessary in the system of literature as in the system of the creationI am willing to allow that there are plenty of faults in this work  Yet lest such reptiles should extend any fang with pleasure at these delicious tidings I must insist that I could very often have written better had it not been for musical necessity which in some instances precludes nerve and in others requires it when the reverse would probably have made the poetry read better  All these considerations are very safe with the public at large to whom I never can address myself without confessing more incapacity of expression than is attributed to me by the sourness of my heartburnt enemies  To these poor creatures did I wish their deserts I should be more cruel and injurious than they have it in their power to be to me  DIBDIN's SELECTED SONGS  SONG  IN THE WEDDING RING  I SAW what seem'd a harmless child  With wings and bow  And aspect mild  Who sobb'd and sigh'd and pin'd  And begg'd I would some boon bestow  On a poor little boy stone blind  Not aware of the danger I instant comply'd  When he drew from his quiver a dart Cry'd  ' My power you shall know'  Then he levell'd his bow  And wounded me right in the heart  THE MILLER's DAUGHTER  IN THE DESERTER  THERE was a miller's daughter  Liv'd in a certain village  Who made a mighty slaughter  For I'd have you to know  Both friend and foe  The clown and the beau  She always laid low  And her portion as I understand  Was three acres of land  Besides a mill  That never stood still  Some sheep and a cow  A harrow and plough  And other things for tillage  What d'ye think of the miller's daughter  II  This miller's pretty daughter  Was a damsel of such fame sir  That knights and squires sought her  But they soon were told  That some were too bold  And some too cold  And some too old  And she gave them to understand  That though they were grand  She'd never be sold  For says Betty says she  ' Since my virtue to me  ' Is dearer than gold  ' You may go from whence you came sir'  What d'ye think of my miller's daughter  III  But when this miller's daughter  Saw Ned the morrice dancer  His person quickly caught her  For who so clean  Upon the green  As Ned was seen  For her his queen  Then blithe as a king  His bells he'd ring  And dance and sing  Like any thing  Says he 'My life  ' Woot be my wife'  A blush and yes was Betty's answer  What d'ye think of my miller's daughter  SONG  IN THE WATERMAN  Two youths for my love are contending in vain  For do all they can  Their sufferings I rally and laugh at their pain  Which which is the man  That deserves me the most Let me ask of my heart  Is it Robin who smirks and who dresses so smart  Or Tom honest Tom who makes plainness his plan  Which which is the man  II  Indeed to be prudent and do what I ought  I do what I can  Yet surely pappa and mamma are in fault  To a different man  They each have advis'd me to yield up my heart  Mamma praises Robin who dresses so smart  Pappa honest Tom who makes plainness his plan  Which which is the man  III  Be kind then my heart and but point out the youth  I'll do what I can  His love to return and return it with truth  Which which is the man  Be kind to my wishes and point out my heart  Is it Robin who smirks and who dresses so smart  Or Tom honest Tom who makes plainness his plan  Which which is the man  BALLAD  IN THE WATERMAN  AND did you not hear of a jolly young waterman  Who at Blackfriar's bridge used for to ply  And he feather'd his oars with such skill and dexterity  Winning each heart and delighting each eye  He look'd so neat and he row'd so steadily  The maidens all flock'd in his boat so readily  And he eyed the young rogues with so charming an air  That this waterman ne'er was in want of a fare  II  What sights of fine folks he oft row'd in his wherry  'Twas clean'd out so nice and so painted withal  He was always first oars when the fine city ladies  In a party to Ranelagh went or Vauxhall  And oftentimes would they be giggling and leering  But 'twas all one to Tom their gibing and jeering  For loving or liking he little did care  For this waterman ne'er was in want of a fare  III  And yet but to see how strangely things happen  As he row'd along thinking of nothing at all  He was ply'd by a damsel so lovely and charming  That she smil'd and so straightway in love he did fall  And would this young damsel but banish his sorrow  He'd wed her tonight before tomorrow  And how should this waterman ever know care  When he's marry'd and never in want of a fare  BALLAD  IN THE WATERMAN  THEN farewel my trimbuilt wherry  Oars and coat and badge farewel  Never more at Chelsea ferry  Shall your Thomas take a spell  II  But to hope and peace a stranger  In the battle's heat I'll go  Where expos'd to every danger  Some friendly ball shall lay me low  III  Then mayhap when homeward steering  With the news my messmates come  Even you the story hearing  With a sigh may crypoor Tom  BALLAD  IN THE WATERMAN  INDEED Miss such sweethearts as I am  I fancy you'll meet with but few  To love you more true I defy them  I always am thinking of you  There are maidens would have me in plenty  Nell Cicely Priscilla and Sue  But instead of all these were there twenty  I never should think but of you  II  False hearts all your money may squander  And only have pleasure in view  Ne'er from you a moment I'll wander  Unless to get money for you  The tide when 'tis ebbing or flowing  Is not to the moon half so true  Nor my oars to their time when I'm rowing  As my heart my fond heart is to you  BALLAD  IN THE COBLER  'TWAS in a village near Castlebury  A cobler and his wife did dwell  And for a time no two so merry  Their happiness no tongue can tell  But to this couple the neighbours tell us  Something did happen that caus'd much strife  For going to a neighb'ring alehouse  The man got drunk and beat his wife  II  But though he treated her so vilely  What did this wife good creature do  Kept snug and found a method slily  To wring his heart quite through and through  For Dick the tapster and his master  By the report that then was rife  Were both in hopes by this disaster  To gain the cobler's pretty wife  III  While things went on to rack and ruin  And all their furniture was sold  She seem'd t' approve what each was doing  And got from each a purse of gold  So when the cobler's cares were over  He swore to lead an alter'd life  To mind his work ne'er be a rover  And love no other but his wife  BALLAD  IN THE SERAGLIO  THE world's a strange world child it must be confess'  We all of distress have our share  But since I must struggle to live with the rest  By my troth 'tis no great matter where  We all must put up with what fortune has sent  Be therefore ones lot poor or rich  So there is but a portion of ease and content  By my troth 'tis no great matter which  II  A living's a living and so there's an end  If one honestly gets just enow  And something to spare for the wants of a friend  By my troth 'tis no great matter how  In this world about nothing we busy'd appear  And I've said it again and again  Since quit it one must if ones conscience is clear  By my troth 'tis no great matter when  RONDEAU  IN THE SERAGLIO  BLOW high blow low let tempests tear  The mainmast by the board  My heart with thoughts of thee my dear  And love well stor'd  Shall brave all danger scorn all fear  The roaring winds the raging sea  In hopes on shore  To be once more  Safe moor'd with thee  Aloft while mountains high we go  The whistling winds that scud along  And the surge roaring from below  Shall my signal be  To think on thee  And this shall be my song  Blow high blow low c  And on that night when all the crew  The mem'ry of their former lives  O'er flowing cans of flip renew  And drink their sweethearts and their wives  I'll heave a sigh and think on thee  And as the ship rolls through the sea  The burthen of my song shall be  Blow high blow low c  BALLAD  IN THE SERAGLIO  THE little birds as well as you  I've mark'd with anxious care  How free their pleasures they pursue  How void of every care  But birds of various kinds you'll meet  Some constant to their loves  Are chatt'ring sparrows half so sweet  As tender cooing doves  II  Birds have their pride like human kind  Some on their note presume  Some on their form and some you'll find  Fond of a gaudy plume  Some love a hundred some you'll meet  Still constant to their loves  Are chatt'ring sparrows half so sweet  As tender cooing doves  RONDEAU  IN THE SERAGLIO  THE signal to engage shall be  A whistle and a hollow  Be one and all but firm like me  And conquest soon will follow  You Gunnel keep the helm in hand  Thus thus boys steady steady  Till right a head you see the land  Then soon as we are ready  The signal c  Keep boys a good look out d'ye hear  'Tis for old England's honour  Just as you've brought your lower tier  Broadside to bear upon her  The signal c  All hands then lads the ship to clear  Load all your guns and mortars  Silent as death th' attack prepare  And when your all at quarters  The signal c  SONG  IN POOR VULCAN  VENUS now no more behold me  But an humble village dame  Coarse and homely trappings fold me  And Mistress Maudling is my name  Yet here no less is paid that duty  Ever due to Venus' worth  Not more insensible of beauty  Than gods in heaven are men on earth  BALLAD  IN POOR VULCAN  THAT nature's every where the same  Each passing day discovers  For that in me  Some charms they see  Behold me though a country dame  Leading a crowd of lovers  II  My sporting squire to keep at bay  The course I'll double over  While he intent  On a wrong scent  Shall always find me stole away  When he cries 'Hark to cover'  III  With newcoin'd oaths my grenadier  May think to storm and bluster  And swear by Mars  My eyes are stars  That light to lovehe'll soon find here  Such stuff will ne'er pass muster  IV  Thus will I serve those I distrust  First laugh at then refuse 'em  But ah not so  The shepherd Joe  He like Adonis look'd when first  I press'd him to my bosom  BALLAD  IN POOR VULCAN  THE moment Aurora peep'd into my room  I put on my cloaths and I call'd to my groom  And my head heavy still from the fumes of last night  Took a bumper of brandy to set all things right  And now were well saddled Fleet Dapple and Grey  Who seem'd longing to hear the glad sound hark away  II  Will Whistle by this had uncoupl'd his hounds  Whose extacy nothing could keep within bounds  First forward came Jowler then Scentwell then Snare  Three better staunch harriers ne'er started a hare  Then Sweetlips then Driver then S  aunch and then Tray  All ready to open at hark hark away  III  'Twas now by the clock about five in the morn  And we all gallop'd off to the sound of the horn  Jack Gater Bill Babler and Dick at the gun  And by this time the merry Tom fairplay made one  Who while we were jogging on blithesome and gay  Sung a song and the chorus wasHark hark away  IV  And now Jemmy Lurcher had every bush beat  And no signs of madam nor trace of her feet  Nay we just had begun our sad fortunes to curse  When all of a sudden out starts Mrs Puss  Men horses and dogs all the glad call obey  And echo was heard to cryHark hark away  V  The chase was a fine one she took o'er the plain  Which she doubled and doubled and doubled again  Till at last she to cover return'd out of breath  Where I and Will Whistle were in at the death  Then in triumph for you I the hare did display  And cry'd to the horns my boys hark hark away  BALLAD  IN POOR VULCAN  COME all ye gem'men volunteers  Of glory who would share  And leaving with your wives your fears  To the drum head repair  Or to the noble Serjeant Pike  Come come without delay  You'll enter into present pay  My lads the bargain strike  A golden guinea and a crown  Besides the lord knows what renown  His majesty the donor  And if you die  Why then you lie  Stretch'd on the bed of honour  II  Does any prentice work too hard  Fine cloaths would any wear  Would any one his wife discard  To the drum head repair  Or to the c  III  Is your estate put out to nurse  Are you a castoff heir  Have you no money in your purse  To the drum head repair  Or to the c  BALLAD  IN POOR VULCAN  COME every man now give his toast  Fill up the glass I'll tell you mine  Wine is the mistress I love most  This is my toastnow give me thine  II  Well said my lad ne'er let it stand  I give you Chloe nymph divine  May love and wine go hand in hand  This is my toastnow give me thine  III  Fill up your giasses to the brink  Hebe let no one dare decline  'Twas Hebe taught me first to drink  This is my toastnow give me thine  IV  Gemmen I give my wife d'ye see  May all to make her blest combine  So she be far enough from me  This is my toastnow give me thine  V  Let constant lovers at the feet  Of pale fac'd wenches sigh and pine  For me the first kind girl I meet  Shall be my toastnow give me thine  VI  You toast your wife and you your lass  My boys and welcome here's the wine  For my part he who fills my glass  Shall be my toastnow give me thine  VII  Spirit my lads and toast away  I have still one with yours to join  That we may have enough to pay  This is my toastnow give me thine  BALLAD  IN POOR VULCAN  MADAM you know my trade is war  And what should I deny it for  Whene'er the trumpet sounds from far  I long to hack and hew  Yet madam credit what I say  Were I this moment call'd away  And all the troops drawn in array  I'd rather stay with you  II  Did drums and sprightly trumpets sound  Did Death and Carnage stalk around  Did dying horses bite the ground  Had we no hope in view  Were the whole army lost in smoke  Were they the last words that I spoke  I'd say and dam'me if I joke  I'd rather stay with you  III  Did the foe charge us front and rear  Did e'en the bravest face appear  Impress'd with signs of mortal fear  Though never veteran knew  So terrible and hot a fight  Though all my laurels it should blight  Though I should lose so fine a sight  I'd rather stay with you  DUET  INTENDED FOR POOR VULCAN  JOE  WHEN Serjeant Belswagger that masculine brute  One day had been drinking to swear a recruit  He kiss'd you I saw him or else may I die  And you cruel Maudlin ne'er once cry'd O fie  Again when the squire had come home from the chase  You receiv'd him O gods with a smile on your face  Henceforth then my sheep harum skarum may run  For Maudlin is faithless and I am undone  MAUDLIN  Ah Joe you're a good one one day in my place  My husband at homeI was forc'd to send Grace  I know for a truth which you cannot gainsay  You touzled her well on a cock of new hay  Nay swore you'd be hersand what is worse yet  That you only lov'd me just for what you could get  As for charms then I ne'er will believe I have one  For Joey is faithless and I am undone  JOE  Will you know then the truth on't I touz'd her I own  Though I rather by half would have let it alone  But I did it to see if you jealous would prove  For that people say is a sure sign of love  MAUDLIN  And for me if the squire said soft things in my ear  I suffer'd it thinking he'd call for strong beer  And as to the serjeant 'tis always a rule  One had better be kiss'd than be teaz'dby a fool  BALLAD  IN THE QUAKER  I lock'd up all my treasure  I journey'd many a mile  And by my grief did measure  The passing time the while  II  My business done and over  I hasten'd back amain  Like an expecting lover  To view it once again  III  But this delight was stifled  As it began to dawn  I found the casket rifled  And all my treasure gone  SONG  IN THE QUAKER  WOMEN are Will o' the Wisps 'tis plain  The closer they seem still the more they retire  They teaze you and jade you  And round about lead you  Without hopes of shelter  Ding dong helter skelter  Through water and fire  And when you believe every danger and pain  From your heart you may banish  And you're near the possession of what you desire  That instant they vanish  And the devil a bit can you catch them again  By some they're not badly compar'd to the sea  Which is calm and tempestuous within the same hour  Some say they are Sirens but take it from me  They're a sweet race of angels o'er man that have pow'r  His person his heart and his reason to seize  And lead the poor devil wherever they please  BALLAD  IN THE QUAKER  A kernel from an apple's core  One day on either cheek I wore  Lubin was plac'd on my right cheek  That on my left did Hodge bespeak  Hodge in an instant drop'd to ground  Sure token that his love's unfound  But Lubin nothing could remove  Sure token his is constant love  II  Last May I sought to find a snail  That might my lover's name reveal  Which finding home I quickly sped  And on the hearth the embers spread  When if my letters I can tell  I saw it mark a curious L  O may this omen lucky prove  For L's for Lubin and for Love  RONDEAU  IN THE QUAKER  WHILE the lads in the village shall merrily ah  Sound their tabors I'll hand thee along  And I say unto thee that merrily ah  Thou and I will be first in the throng  Just then when the youth who last year won the dow'r  And his ma  e shall the sports have begun  When the gay voice of gladness resounds from each bow'r  And thou long'st in thy heart to make one  While the lads c  Those joys that are harmless what mortal can blame  'Tis my maxim that youth should be free  And to prove that my words and my deeds are the same  Believe thou shall presently see  While the lads c  BALLAD  IN ROSE AND COLIN  I lost my poor mother  When only a child  And I fear'd such another  So gentle and mile  Was not to be found  But I saw my mistake  For scarce was she gone  But I prov'd I had father and mother in one  And though at this minute he makes my heart ach  There's not such another search all the world round  II  I'd reach'd my teens fairly  As blithe as a bee  His care late and early  Being all to please me  No one thing above ground  Was too good for his Rose  At wake or at fair  I was dress'd out so gaily lord people would stare  And I say it again though he's peevish God knows  There's not such another search all the world round  III  But love who they tell us  Does many strange things  Makes all the world jealous  And madeven kings  They say he can wound  This love is the sore  Since Colin came here  This father so kind is a father severe  Yet still will I say though he scolds more and more  There's not such another search all the world round  BALLAD  IN ROSE AND COLIN  HERE's all her geer her wheel her work  These little bobbins to and fro  How oft I've seen her fingers jirk  Her pretty fingers white as snow  Each object to me is so dear  My heart at sight on't throbbing goes  'Twas here she sat her down and here  She told me she was Colin's Rose  II  This posy for her when she's dress'd  I've brought alas how happy I  Could I be like these flowers caress'd  And like them on her bosom die  The violet and pink I took  And every pretty flower that blows  The rose too but how mean 'twill look  When by the side of my sweet Rose  BALLAD  IN ROSE AND COLIN  THERE was a jolly shepherd lad  And Colin was his name  And all unknown to her old dad  He sometimes to see Peggy came  The object of his flame  One day of his absence too secure  Her father thunder'd at the door  When fearing of his frown  Says she dear love the chimney climb  I can't cries he there is not time  Besides I should tumble down  II  What could they do ta'en unawares  They thought and thought again  In closets underneath the stairs  To hide himself 'twere all in vain  He'd soon be found 'twere plain  Get up the chimney love you must  Cried she or else the door he'll burst  I would not for a crown  Young Colin seeing but this shift  E'en mounted up Peg lent a lift  And cry'd don't tumble down  III  With throbbing heart now to the door  Poor Peggy runs in haste  Thinking to trick her father sure  But haste the proverb says makes waste  Which proverb here's wellplac'd  Her father scolded her his best  Call'd names and said among the rest  Pray have you seen that clown  She scarce had time to answer no  When black all over as a crow  Young Colin tumbled down  BALLAD  IN ROSE AND COLIN  EXCUSE me pray ye do dear neighbour  But Rose you know and I  Have oft partook one sport or labour  While you have pleas'd stood by  And since from little children playing  You've kindly call'd me son  I thought to Rose I might be saying  " Goodday" and no harm done  II  When you and father gravely counted  One morning in the barn  To how much in a day it mounted  That both of us could earn  Since then you down the law were laying  And calling me your son  I thought to Rose I might be saying  " Good day" and no harm done  BALLAD  IN ANNETTE AND LUBIN  YOUNG and void of art or guile  From ill intentions free  If love I've cherish'd all this while  It came in spight of me  When you've to me and I've to you  Try'd who could kindest prove  If that was lovewhat then to do  To fly from this same love  II  When absent from you I have mourn'd  And thought each hour a score  When on a sudden you return'd  I've thrill'd with joy all o'er  They say 'twas loveI thought 'twas you  Had made my heart thus move  Alas what can a poor girl do  To fly from this same love  III  To every thing that you can ask  What should I say but yes  It is because I like the task  I freely grant each kiss  You're all to meI'm all to you  This truth our deaths would prove  Were we to partWhat then to do  To fly from this same love  DUET  IN ANNETTE LUBIN  BAILIFF  THEY tell me you listen to all that he says  That each hour of the day you are full of his praise  That you always together your flocks lead to graze  Is this true damsel  ANNETTE  Yes Mister Bailly  BAILIFF  They tell me also you are so void of grace  As to brag that dear form and that sweet pretty face  That young dog shall be welcome to kiss and embrace  Is this true damsel  ANNETTE  Yes Mister Bailly  BAILIFF  The neighbours all say though I credit them not  They have heard you declare that content with your lot  Any king you'd refuse for that lout and a cot  Is this true damsel  ANNETTE  Yes Mister Bailly  BAILIFF  But one thing I vow frights me out of my life  'Tis allow'd on all hands that is barring the strife  That you both liv'd together just like man and wife  Is this true damsel  ANNETTE  Yes Mister Bailly  DUET  IN ANNETTE LUBIN  LUBIN  'Tis true that oft in the same mead  We both have led our flocks to feed  Where by each other's side we've sat  ANNETTE  Alas there was no harm in that  LUBIN  'Tis true for thee this cot I rose  Where thou tak'st pleasure to repose  For which I found the greenest plat  ANNETTE  Alas there was no harm in that  LUBIN  'Tis true when tired thou fain would rest  And thy dear lips to mine I've press'd  Thy breath so sweet I've wondered at  ANNETTE  Alas there was no harm in that  LUBIN  Ah but 'tis true when thou hast slept  Closer and closer have I crept  And while my heart went pitapat  ANNETTE  Alas there was no harm in that  BALLAD  IN ANNETTE LUBIN  A plague take all such grumbling elves  If they will rail so be it  Because we're happier than themselves  They can't endure to see it  For me I never shall repine  Let whate'er fate o'ertake us  For love and Annette shall be mine  Though all the world forsake us  II  Then dear Annette regard them not  The hours shall pass on gayly  In spight of every snare and plot  Of that old doating Bailly  No never Annette thou'lt repine  Let whate'er fate o'ertake us  For love and Lubin shall be thine  Though all the world forsake us  BALLAD  IN ANNETTE LUBIN  MY Lord and please you him and I  Morn noon and night in every weather  From little children not this high  In the same cottage liv'd together  Our parents left me to his care  Saying let no one put upon her  No that I won't says he I swear  And he ne'er lies and like your honour  II  As I was saying we grew up  For all the world sister and brother  One never had nor bit nor sup  Unless it was partook by t'other  And I am sure instead of me  Were it a duchess he had won her  He is so good and I've d'ye see  A tender heart and like your honour  III  But woe is ours now comes the worst  Today our sorrows are beginning  What I thought loveoh I shall burst  That nasty Bailly says was sinning  With Lubin who of all the bliss  I ever tasted is the donor  I took delight to toy and kiss  'Till I'm with child and like your honour  BALLAD  IN THE CHELSEA PENSIONER  BROTHER soldiers why cast down  Never boys be melancholy  You say our lives are not our own  But therefore should we not be jo'ly  This poor tenement at best  Depends on fickle chance Mean while  Drink laugh and sing and for the rest  We'll boldly brave each rude campaign  Secure if we return again  Our pretty landlady shall

door  Where poor Lysander drank and eat  His dinner finish'd up he rose  Stalk'd sighing silently and slow  To where were hung his Sunday's clothes  Then took a walk to chase his woe  III  The sun to Thetis made his way  When underneath a friendly shade  A shepherd sung in accents gay  His passion for a gentle maid  O lovers what are all your cares  Your sighs your sufferings tell me what  To Daphne 'tis Lysander swears  And lovely Phillis is forgot  SONG  IN THE TOUCHSTONE  MY tearsalas I cannot speak  Must thank this goodness sure divine  For had I wordswords are too weak  Too poor to

her value higher  " For that she loves me every hour  " Each moment some new instance proves  " Thus do we see the tender flower  " Shrink from the sun whose warmth it loves  III  " How to resolve then what resource  " By fair means she will ne'er come to  " What of a little gentle force  " Suppose I try what that will do  " I know she'il tears in torrents pour  " I know her cries will pierce

SHEPERDESS OF THE ALPS  HERE sleeps in peace beneath this rustic vase  The tenderest lover a husband could prove  Of all this distress alas I am the cause  So much I adored him heaven envied my love  The sighs I respire ev'ry morn I arise  The misery I cherish the grief and the pain  The thousand of tears that fall from my eyes  Are all the sad comforts for me that remain  II  When his colours display'd honour call'd him to arms  By tender persuasions I kept him away  His glory forgetting for those fatal charms  And to punish me he is depriv'd of the day  Since when to his memory I've

FREEMASON  AT a jovial meeting of gods once on high  Ere Bacchus was hatch'd from old Jupiter's thigh  This one told his story and that sung his song  And did what he could lest the time should seem long  Apollo read verses the Graces wreath'd flowers  The Muses of harmony sung forth the powers  Bully Mars crack'd his joke and sly Momus his jest  Yet their mirth wanted something to give it a zest  II  Said Jove our assembly today's pretty full  Yet I don't know how 'tis we are horridly dull  We have all the ingredients that mirth should inspire  But some clayborn alloy damps our heav'nly fire  I have itin this I'll a mixture inclose  Of all the delights whence good fellowship flows  And we'll taste of its produce for mirth's bad at best  When there's any thing wanting to give it a zest  III  So saying so doing he buried the shrine  Which quickly sprung up in the form of a vine  The leaves broad and verdant the fruit deepest blue  Whence a juice flow'd that health love or youth might renew  Its influence to feel they came round it in swarms  Mars took draughts of courage and Venus drank charms  Momus swallow'd bon mots Cupid loveso the rest  While Jove spurning nectar cry'dThis is

Westminster Hall I oft tip the long trot  III  My coach receives all like the gallows and sea  So I touch but my fare you know all's one to me  The men of the gown and the men of the sword  A ma'am or

humours  And on complexions oft we gaze  Brought home from the perfumers  For hid as it were beneath a cloak  The beauty's false that wins you  Then pardon me by way of joke  If I prefer my Dingy  II  A handkerchief can rub away  Your roses and your lilies  The more you rub the more you may  My Dingy dingy still is  Besides her hair is black as jet  Her eyes are gems from India  Rail as you list then I shall yet  For joke's sake love poor Dingy  BALLAD  IN THE ISLANDERS  DID fortune bid me chuse a state  From all that's rich and all that's great  From all that ostentation brings  The splendor pride and pomp of kings  These gifts and more did she display  With health that felt not life's decay  I'd spurn with scorn the useless lot  Were my Camilla's name forgot  II  But did she for my fate

ev'ry height  A turbulent unruly flood  Which with the ocean would unite  Reason's a fountain clam serene  Which near gay fields and laughing bow'rs  While it reflects th' enchanting scene  Is borne among a bed of flowers  BALLAD  IN THE ISLANDERS  A bed of moss we'll straight prepare  Where near him gently creeping  We'll pat his cheeks and stroke his hair  And watch him while he's sleeping  II  Sweet flowers of every scent and hue  Pinks violets and roses  And blooming Hyacynths we'll strew  As sweetly he reposes  III  And we'll with fond emotion start  And while with admiration  We softly

fine Melton oysters as ever were eat  Now see what a change all the muscles for me  May be trod under foot or thrown into the sea  My Joey is false and the once sprightly tone  With which I cry'd oysters is sunk to a drone  II  When the last kit of salmon we sat down to broach  And you told me your heart was as sound as a roach  How sweet was my temper what joys did I feel  Little thinking you'd slip through my hands like an eel  But my temper's now chang'dI that once was so mild  And was thought to be gentle and meek as a child  So crusty am grown I ne'er speak a word civil  And my

what we see will we believe  Though ill on ill we're heaping  Though to this day from mother Eve  We've always paid for peeping  II  Thus curious girls urg'd by their youth  Thoughtless what they were doing  Have falsehood found disguis'd like truth  And mask'd like pleasure ruin  Instead of smiling who must grieve  Whose joys are turn'd to weeping  And who too late like mother Eve  Find they have

III  Now a wolf from their dams  I steal plenty of lambs  Pamper'd high and well fedan insatiable glutton  In much the same sphere  When a man I move here  Hake and break laws at pleasure and kill my

homage pay  To him who gave another morn  And well with strength his nerves to brace  Urges the sportsman to the chase  II  Do we pursue the timid hare  As trembling o'er the lawn she bounds  Still of her safety have we care  While seeming death her steps surrounds  We the defenceless creature spare  And instant stop the welltaught hounds  For cruelty should ne'er disgrace  The wellearn'd pleasure of the chase  III  Do we pursue the subtle fox  Still let him breaks and rivers try  Through marshes wade or climb the rocks  The deepmouth'd hounds shall following fly  And while he every danger moeks  Unpitied shall the culprit die  To quell his cruel artful race  Is labour worthy of the chase  IV  Return'd with shaggy spoils well stored  To our convivial joys at night  We toast and first our country's lord  Anxious who most shall do him right  The fair next crowns the social board  Britons should love as well as fight  For he who slights the tender race  Is held unworthy of the chase  SONG  IN LIBERTYHALL  WHO to my wounds a balm advises  But little knows what I endure  The patient's pain to torture rises  When medicine's try'd and fails to cure  What can the wisest council teach

steer  No dangerous toil but he'd encounter  With skill and in contempt of fear  In fight a lion the battle ended  Meek as the bleating lamb he'd prove  Thus Jack had manners courage merit  Yet did he sigh and all for love  II  The song the jest the flowing liquor  For none of these had Jack regard  He while his messmates were carousing  High sitting on the pendant yard  Would think upon his fairone's beauties  Swear never from such charms to rove  That truly he'd adore them living  And dying sighto end his love  The same express the crew commanded  Once more to view their native land  Among the rest brought Jack some tidings  Would it had been his love's fair hand  Oh fateher death defac'd the letter  Instant his pulse forgot to move  With quiv'ring lips and eyes uplifted  He heav'd a sighand dy'd for love  GLEE  IN LIBERTYHALL  WHAT if my pleasures fools condemn  Because I am not dull like them  Because no minute I let pass  Unmark'd by a convivial glass  Or else return'd

spirit live let him not mourn  But see emboss'd upon my urn  Bacchus and Venus in a wreath  With this inscription underneath  " This mortal had a soul divine  " Alternate crown'd with love and wine"  BALLAD  IN LIBERTYHALL  WHEN fairies are lighted by night's silver queen  And feast in the meadow or dance on the green  My Lumkin aside lays his plough and his flail  By yon oak to sit near me and tell his fond tale  And though I'm assur'd the same vows were believ'd  By Patty and Ruth he forsook and deceiv'd  Yet so sweet are his words and like truth so appear  I pardon the treason the traitor's so dear  II  I saw the straw bonnet he bought at the fair  The rosecolour'd ribbon to deck Jenny's hair  The shoeties of Bridget and still worse than this  The gloves he gave Peggy for stealing a kiss  All these did I see and with heartrending pain  Swore to part yet I know when I see him again  His words and his looks will like truth so appear  I shall pardon the treason the traitor's so dear  BALLAD  IN LIBERTYHALL  SEE the course throng'd with gazers the sports are begun  The confusion but hearI'll bet you firdone done  Ten thousand strange murmurs resound far and near  Lords hawkers and jockies assail the tir'd ear  While with neck like a rainbow erecting his crest  Pamper'd prancing and pleas'd his head touching his breast  Scarcely snuffing the air he's so proud and elate  The highmettled racer first starts for the plate  II  Now reynard's turn'd out and o'er hedge and ditch rush  Hounds horses and huntsmen all hard at his brush  They run him at length and they have him at bay  And by scent and by view cheat a long tedious way  While alike born for sports of the field or the course  Always sure to come thorough a staunch and fleet horse  When fairly run down the fox yields up his breath  The highmettled racer is in at the death  III  Grown aged used up and turn'd out of the stud  Lame spavin'd and windgall'd but yet with some blood  While knowing postilions his pedigree trace  Tell his dam won this sweepstakes his sire gain'd that race  And what matches he won to the ostlers count o'er  As they loiter their time at some hedge alehouse door  While the harness sore galls and the spurs his sides goad  The highmettled racer's a hack on the road  IV  Till at last having labour'd drudg'd early and late  Eow'd down by degrees he bends on to his fate  Blind old lean and feeble he tugs round a mill  Or draws sand till the sand of his hourglass stands still  And now cold and lifeless exposed to the view  In the very same cart which he yesterday drew  While a pitying crowd his sad relicks surrounds  The highmettled racer is sold for the hounds  BALLAD  IN LIBERTYHALL  Do salmons love a lucid stream  Do thirsty sheep love fountains  Do Druids

fearless will I go with thee  Resign'd to cruel fate's decree  And bravely this I tell you  When on the spot my soldier fell  I'd shed a tear  The world should hear  Mingling with his my passing bell  When the drum beats reveillez  BOTH  To the world's end I'd go with thee  Where thou art danger ne'er can be  My joy no tongue can tell you  And sure such love may perils scorn  Brave all alarms  While in my arms  I hold thee ev'ry op'ning morn  When the drum beats reveillez  BALLAD  NOSEGAYS I cry and though little you pay  They're such as you cannot get every day  Who'll buy who'll buy'tis nosegays I cry  Who'll buy who'll buy'tis nosegays I cry  Each mincing ambling lisping blade  Who smi  es and talks of blisses  He never felt is here portray'd  In form of a narcifsus  Nosegays I cry c  Statesmen like Indians who adore  The sun by courting power  Cannot be shewn their likeness more  Than in th' humble sunflower  Nosegays I cry c  Poets I've here in sprigs of bays  Devils in the bush are friars  Nettles are critics who damn plays  And satirists are briars  Nosegays I cry c  BALLAD  IN TOM THUMB  THE younker who his first essay  Makes in the front of battle  Stands all aghast while cohorts play  And bullets round him rattle  But pride steps in and now no more  Fell fear his javlin lances  Like dulcet flutes the cannons roar  And groans turn country dances  II  So frights and flurries and what not  Upon my fancy rushes  I fear I know not why or what  I'm cover'd o'er with blushes  But let the honey season fly  To second well my clapper  The kitchen's whole artillery  Shall grace my husband's knapper  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  'Tis said we venturous diehards when we leave the shore  Our friends should mourn  Left we return  To bless their sight no more  But this is all a notion  Bold Jack can't understand  Some die upon the ocean  And some on the land  Then since 'tis clear  Howe'er we steer  No man's life's under his command  Let tempests howl  And billows roll  And danger press  Of those in spight there are some joys  Us jolly tars to bless  For Saturday night still comes my boys  To drink to Poll and Bess  II  One seaman hands the sails another heaves the log  The purser swops  Our pay for slops  The landlord sells us grog  Thus each man to his station  To keep life's ship in trim  What argufies noration  The rest is all a whim  Cheerly my hearts  Then play your parts  Boldly resolv'd to sink or swim  The mighty surge  May ruin urge  And danger press  Of those in spight c  III  For all the world's just like the ropes aboard a ship  Each man's rigg'd out  A vessel stout  To take for life a trip  The shrouds and stays and braces  Are joys and hopes and fears  The halliards sheets and traces  Still as each passion veers  And whim prevails  Direct the sails  As on the sea of life he steers  Then let the storm  Heaven's face deform  And danger press  Of those in spight c  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  THE greyey'd Aurora in saffron array  'Twixt my curtains in vain took a peep  And though broader and broader still brightened the day  Nought could rouse me so sound did I sleep  At length rosy Phoebus look'd full in my face  Full and fervent but nothing would do  Till the dogs yelp'd impatient and long'd for the chase  And shouting appear'd the whole crew  Come on yoics honies hark forward my boys  There ne'er was so charming a morn  Follow follow wake Echo to share in our joys  Now the music now echomark mark  Hark hark  The silvermouth'd hounds and the mellowton'd hom  II  Fresh as that smiling morning from which they dr  health  My companions are rang'd on the plain  Blest with rosy contentment that nature's best wealth  Which monarchs aspire to in vain  Now spirits like fire every bosom invade  And now we in order set out  While each neighbouring valley rock woodland and glade  Revollies the airrending shout  Come on yoics honey c  III  Now reynard's unearth'd and runs fairly in view  Now we've lost him so subtly he turns  But the scent lies so strong still we fearless pursue  While each object impatiently burns  Hark Babler gives tongue and Fleet Driver and Sly  The fox now the covert forsakes  Again he's in view let us after him fly  Now now to the river he takes  Come on yoics honies c  IV  From the river poor reynard can make but one push  No longer so proudly he flies  Tir'd jaded worn out we are close to his brush  And conquer'd like Caesar he dies  And now in high glee to the board we repair  Where sat as we jovially quaff  His portion of merit let every man share  And promote the convivial laugh  Come on yoics honey c  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  FROM prudence let my joys take birth  Let me not be passion's slave  Approv'd by reason sweet's the mirth  Vice of pleasure is the grave  Then still to reason's dictates true  Select the sweets of life like bees  Thus your enjoyments will be few  But such as on reflection please  III  Wine exhilarates the soul  Inspires the mirth of every feast  But gluttons so may drain the bowl  Till man degenerates to beast  Then mirth and wisdom keep in view  And freely on the bottle seize  What though your pleasures are but few  They're such as on reflection please  III  Love the source of human joys  The mind with bliss that sweetly fills  Too often its own end destroys  And proves the source of human ills  Here reason's dictates keep in view  Or farewel freedom farewel ease  The real joys of life are few  But such as on reflection please  IV  Then while we meet let's only own  Joys that do honour to the heart  And ceasing to prize these alone  Deplore our frailty sigh and part  Meanwhile to reason's dictates true  Select the sweets of life like bees  Thus your enjoyments will be few  But such as on reflection please  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  THE spangled green confess'd the morn  The rosebud dropt a tear  And liquid prisms bedeck'd the thorn  When Sandy sought his dear  Sure never loon was e'er so cross'd  Ye shepherds swains impart  Where did she gang ah me I've lost  The lassy of my heart  II  Her charms are felt as soon as kenn'd  Eyne bright as brilliant gem  But of her beauties there's no end  Why need I talk of them  Each shepherd swain finds to his cost  What power they can impart  But most poor Sandy who has lost  The lassy of his heart  III  But mine's the fault and mine's the grief  How could I rashly dare  Oh I have sin'd beyond relief  'Gainst all that's sweet and rare  But see she comes cease heart to bound  Some comfort ah impart  She smiles ah shepherds I have found  The lassy of my heart  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  OF all sensations pity brings  To proudly swell the ample heart  From which the willing sorrow springs  In others grief that bears a part  Of all sad sympathy's delights  The manly dignity of grief  A joy in mourning that excites  And gives the anxious mind relief  Of these would you the feeling know  Most gen'rous noble greatly brave  That ever taught a heart to glow  'Tis the tear that bedews a soldier's grave  II  For hard and painful is his lot  Let dangers come he braves them all  Valiant perhaps to be forgot  Or undistinguish'd doom'd to fall  Yet wrapt in conscious worth secure  The world that now forgets his toils  He views from a retreat obscure  And quits it with a willing smile  Then trav'ler one kind drop bestow  'Twere graceful pity nobly brave  Nought ever taught the heart to glow  Like the tear that bedews a soldier's grave  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  Go patter to lubbers and swabs d'ye see  'Bout danger and fear and the like  A tight water boat and good sea room give me  And t'ent to a little I strike  Though the tempest top gallant masts smack smooth should smite  And shiver each splinter of wood  Clear the wreck stow the yards and bouze every thing tight  And under reef'd foresail we'll scud  Avast nor don't think me a milksop so soft  To be taken for trifles aback  For they says there's a providence sits up aloft  To keep watch for the life of poor Jack  II  Why I heard the good chaplain palaver one day  About souls heaven mercy and such  And my timbers what lingo he'd coil and belay  Why 'twas just all as one as high Dutch  But he said how a sparrow can't founder d'ye see  Without orders that comes down below  And many fine things that prov'd clearly to me  That providence takes us in tow  For says he do you mind me let storms e'er so oft  Take the topsails of sailors aback  There's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft  To keep watch for the life of poor Jack  III  I said to our Poll for you see she would cry  When last we weighed anchor for sea  What argufies sniv'ling and piping your eye  Why what a damn'd fool you must be  Can't you see the world's wide and there's room for us all  Both for seamen and lubbers ashore  And if to old Davy I should go friend Poll  Why you never will hear of me more  What then all's a hazard come don't be so soft  Perhaps I may laughing come back  For d'ye see there's a cherub sits smiling aloft  To keep watch for the life of poor Jack  IV  D'ye mind me a sailor should be every inch  All as one as a piece of a ship  And with her brave the world without offering to flinch  From the moment the anchor's a trip  As for me in all weathers all times sides and ends  Nought's a trouble from duty that springs  For my heart is my Poll's and my rhino my friend's  And as for my life 'tis the king's  Even when my time comes ne'er believe me so soft  As with grief to be taken aback  That same little cherub that sits up aloft  Will look out a good birth for poor Jack  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  WHAT though from Venus Cupid sprung  No attribute divine  Whate'er the bawling bards have sung  Had he his bow till Bacchus strung  And dipp'd his darts in wine  Till old Silenus plung'd the boy  In nectar from the vine  Then love that was before a toy  Became the source of mortal joy  The urchin shook his dewy wings  And careless levelled clowns and kings  Such power has mighty wine  II  When Theseus on the naked shore  Fair Ariadne left  D'ye think she did her fate deplore  Or her fine locks or bosom tore  Like one of hope bereft  Not she indeed her fleeting love  From mortal turns divine  And as gay Bacchus' tigers move  His car ascends amidst a grove  Of vines surrounded by a throng  Who lead the jolly pair along  Almost half gone with wine  III  Ma'am Helen lov'd the Phrygian boy  He thought her all his own  But hotest love will soonest cloy  He ne'er had brought her safe to Troy  But for the wife of Thone  She merry gossip mixed a cup  Of tipple right divine  To keep love's flagging spirits up  And Helen drank it every sup  This liquor is 'mongst learned elves  Nepenthe call'd but 'twixt ourselves  'Twas nothing more than wine  IV  Of Lethe and its flowery brink  Let musty poets prate  Where thirsty souls are said to drink  That never they again may think  Upon their former state  What is there in this soulless lot  I pray you so divine  Grief finds the palace and the cot  Which for a time were well forgot  Come here then in our lethe share  The true oblivion of your care  Is only found in wine  RONDEAU  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  SMILING grog is the sailor's best hope his sheet anchor  His compass his cable his log  That gives him a heart which life's cares cannot canker  Though dangers around him  Unite to confound him  He braves them and tips off his grog  'Tis grog only grog  Is his rudder his compass his cable his log  The sailor's sheet anchor is grog  What though he to a friend in trust  His prize money convey  Who to his bond of faith unjust  Cheats him and runs away  What's to be done he vents a curse  'Gainst all false hearts ashore  Of the remainder clears his purse  And then to sea for more  There smiling grog c  What though his girl who often swore  To know no other charms  He finds when he returns ashore  Clasp'd in a rivals arms  What's to be done he vents a curse  And seeks a kinder she  Dances gets groggy clears his purse  And goes again to sea  To crosses born still trusting there  The waves less faithless than the fair  There into toils to rush again  And stormy perils bravewhat then  Smiling grog c  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  YANKO he tell and he no lie  We near one pretty brook  Him floming hair him lovely

in mine  The sun one dale as well one hill  Make warm where'er him shine  II  You broder him him broder you  So all de world should call  For nature say and she say true  That men be broder all  If cruel man like tiger grim  Come bold in thirst of blood  Poor manbe noblepity him  That he no honest good  Virtue in foe be virtue still  Fine stone be found in mine  The sun one dale as well one hill  Make warm where'er him shine  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  I am a jolly fisherman  I catch what I can get  Still going on my betters plan  All's fish that comes to net  Fish just like men I've often caught  Crabs gudgeons poor John codfish  And many a time to market brought  A dev'lish sight of odd fish  Thus all are fishermen through life  With wary pains and labour  This baits with gold and that a wife  And all to catch his neighbour  Then praise the jolly fisherman  Who takes what he can get  Still going on his betters' plan  All's fish that comes to net  II  The pike to catch the little fry  Extends his greedy jaw  For all the world as you and I  Have seen your man of law  He who to laziness devotes  His time is sure a numb fish  And members who give silent votes  May fairly be called dumb fish  False friends to eels we may compare  The roach resembles true ones  Like goldfish we find old ones rare  Plenty as herrings new ones  Then praise c  III  Like fish then mortals are a trade  And trapp'd and sold and bought  The old wife and the tender maid  Are both with tickling caught  Indeed the fair are caught 'tis said  If you but throw the line in  With maggots flies or something red  Or any thing that's shining  With small fish you must lie in wait  For those of high condition  But 'tis alone a golden bait  Can catch a learn'd physician  Then praise c  SONG  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  ARM'D with javelin arm'd with dart  With mighty arm and steady heart  We to the battle go  Yet ere we part  We join with all our friends so dear  And fervent adoration pay  To the bright orb that gave us day  Then void of fear  We rush to meet the foe  Stationed on impervious ground  We watch their numbers scatter'd round  The subtle ambush then prepare  And see they fall into the snare  Hid as in the woods we lay  They tread the unsuspected way  Sudden and fierce from every bush  Upon the astonish'd foe we rush  Bold and resolvedand now around  Hark the dreadful warwhoop sound  Confusion terror and dismay  It scatters as it wings its way  They fly confusion in their train  And sanguine slaughter treads the plain  Hark of our friends the welcome cry  Proclaims for us the victory  Then fervent adoration pay  To the bright orb that gave us day  See the festive train advance  Breath the music lead the dance  Sound the cymbals  Beat the tymbals  Haste in glad procession come  To our anxious friends at home  For our reception who prepare  While acclamations rend the air  And loudly a whole nation cry  Honour glory victory  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  BE it known to all those whosoe'er it regards  That we singers of ballads were always call'd bards  And from Ida to Grubstreet the muses who follow  Are each mother's son the true spawn of Apollo  Thus recording great men or a flea or a star  Or the spheres or a jew'sharp we're all on a par  Nor in this do I tell you a word of a lie  For Homer sung ballads and so do I  II  Don't you know what the ancients weregreat things they talk'd  How they rode upon Pegasusthat's to say walk'd  That near kindred gods they drove Phoebus's chariot  The English of which isthey liv'd in a garret  And thus they went forward Diogenes quaff'd  Heraclitus cried and Democritus laugh'd  Menander made multitudes both laugh and cry  But Homer sung ballads and so do I  III  Thus did they strange whimsical notions pursue  Some argued on one leg and some upon two  To which last my pretensions are not hypothetic  For 'tis certainly clear I'm a parapatetic  Lycurgus and Solon 'bout laws made a pother  Which went in at one ear and then out at t'other  Old songs such as mine are will nobody buy  Come Homer sung ballads and so do I  IV  Historic was Pliny and Plato divine  Ovid wrote about love and Anacreon wine  Great Cicero argued to every man's palate  And when he was out'twas a hole in the ballad  Thus to great men of old who have made such a rout  My claim to call cousin I've fairly made out  And if any hereafter my right should deny  Tell 'em Homer sung ballads and so do I  BALLAD  IN THE BYSTANDER  LOOK fairly all the world around  And as you truth deliver  Tell me what character is found  A real savoir vivre  Who truly merits sober fame  To find you need not wander  None can detect life's fraudful game  So well as they Bystander  II  The lover cogs and palms and slips  The easy fair to buffle  And still to win that stake her lips  Will deal and cut and shuffle  Still will he ply each subtle art  Till he has quite trapann'd her  And then is sure to trump her heart  If absent the Bystander  III  Preferment is a bowling green  Where placed in each position  Bowls jostling in and out are seen  To reach the Jack ambition  The bias int'rest still they try  Twist turn and well meander  Yet their manoeuvres rub or fly  Are known to the Bystander  IV  The law's a game at whist wherein  The parties nine are both in  Where tricks alone the game can win  And honours go for nothing  And while they a sure game to nick  Their clients money squander  Full many more than one odd trick  Discovers the Bystander  V  The coxcomb plays at shuttlecock  The wit commands and questions  The carping cits to commerce flock  Each follows his suggestions  Yet he alone who merits fame  Who blunts the shafts of slander  And on the square life's motley game  Best plays is the Bystander  BALLAD  IN THE GRACES  AT first like an infant appearing  With neither his bow nor his dart  To his wiles we attend without fearing  Till he creeps by degrees to our hearts  When soon for our folly requited  This guest the sole master we find  For scarce to the bosom invited  He lords it at will o'er the mind  BALLAD  IN THE GRACES  SAY flutt'ring heart  Why after days of sweet delight  Where conscious innocence bore part  Serene as smiling morn peaceful as silver night  Or gay as noon when Phoebus' beams shone bright  Say how one hour  One little instant could remove  That vacant careless joy what power  Inflict the torments we now prove  Cynthia forbid it ever should be love  Dear goddess for fair honour's sake  Relieve the torments we partake  Teach us to cure our am'rous fires  Or else permit us our desires  And this with zealous care perform  Swift as the wind that rules the storm  Swift as the glowing god of day  Darts from afar a downward ray  And so shall vot'ries to thy praise  A thousand thousand altars raise  BALLAD  IN THE HONEST IMPOSTOR  THAT girl who fain would chuse a mate  Should ne'er in fondness fail her  May thank her lucky stars if fate  Should splice her to a sailor  He braves the storm the battle's heat  The yellow boys to nail her  Diamonds if diamonds she could eat  Would seek her honest sailor  II  If she'd be constant still his heart  She sure will never fail her  For though a thousand leagues apart  Still faithful is her sailor  If she be false still he is kind  And absent does bewail her  Her trusting as he trusts the wind  Still faithless to the sailor  III  A butcher can procure her prog  Threethreads to drink a tailor  What's that to biscuit and to grog  Procured her by her sailor  She who would such a mate refuse  The devil sure must ail her  Search round and if your wise you'll chuse  To wed an honest sailor  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  'Twas in the good ship Rover  I sailed the world around  And for three years and over  I ne'er touch'd British ground  At length in England landed  I left the roaring main  Found all relations stranded  And went to sea again  II  That time bound straight to Portugal  Right fore and aft we bore  But when we'd made Cape Ortugal  A gale blew off the shore  She lay so did it shock her  A log upon the main  Till sav'd from Davy's locker  We put to sea again  III  Next in a frigate sailing  Upon a squally night  Thunder and lightening hailing  The horrors of the fight  My precious limb was lopped off  I when they'd eas'd my pain  Thank'd God I was not popped off  And went to sea again  IV  Yet still am I enabled  Do bring up in life's rear  Although I'm quite disabled  And lie in Greenwich tier  The king God bless his royalty  Who saved me from the main  I'll praise with love and loyalty  But ne'er to sea again  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  THE morning breaks  Those ruddy streaks  Proclaims the opening day  With glowing health  The sportsman's wealth  Away boys come away  The mellow horn  On the still morn  Pours sounds which echo mocks  While following bound  Man horse and hound  T' unearth the wily fox  Hark echo mocks  The winding horn  That on the expanded wing of morn  Though sweet the sound in dreadful yell  Tolls out a knell  To the devoted fox  II  Now off he's thrown  The day's our own  See yonder where he takes  To cheat our eyes  In vain he tries  The rivers and the brakes  The mellow horn  Breaks on the morn  And leads o'er hills and rocks  While following bound  Man horse and hound  T' entrap the wily fox  Hark echo mocks c  III  Now now he's seized  The dogs well pleased  Behold his eyeballs roll  He yields his breath  And from his death  Is born the flowing bowl  The mellow horn  That through the morn  Led over hills and rocks  Now sounds a call  To see the fall  Of the expiring fox  Hark echo mocks c  GLEE  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  Come round me and weep to your hearts take despair  'Tis a cause that all nature must mourn  Poor Hylas of love who from all had a share  From our wishes for ever is torn  That Hylas to whom we look'd up for a smile  As we blessings from heaven would obtain  Whose form was so faultless whose tongue knew no guile  Is gone and our wishes are vain  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  'TIS true the marks of many years  Upon my wrinkled front appears  Yet have I no such idle fears  This will my fortune spoil  Gold still some happiness bestows  E'en where no youthful ardour glows  For proof dear girl take these rouleaus  And give me a sweet smile  II  'Tis true upon my haggard face  No marks of beauty can you trace  Nor wears my figure ought of grace  To ensure the lover's bliss  Yet am I no such horrid fright  But that bank notes may set things right  Take then these bills all drawn at sight  And give me a sweet kiss  III  'Tis true I know not to be kind  And that within my hardened mind  No more a jewel can you find  Than beauty in my face  But one within this casket here  May make amends its lustre's clear  Nor shall I think I've sold it dear  Paid by a sweet embrace  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  COME painter with thy happiest slight  Portray me every grace  In that blest region of delight  My charming Sylvia's face  And hear me painter to enhance  The value of thine art  Steal from her eyes that very glance  That stole away my heart  II  Her forehead paint in sway and rule  Where sits with pleasure grac'd  A form like Venus beautiful  And like Diana chaste  Then paint her cheeks come paint and gaze  Guard well thy heart the while  And then her mouth where Cupid plays  In an eternal smile  III  Next drawpresumptuous painter hold  Ah think'st to thee twas given  To paint her bosomwould'st so bold  Presume to copy heaven  Nay leave

Now up and down now to and fro  What then he takes it cheerly  Blest with a smiling can of grog  If duty call  Stand rise or fall  To fate's last verge he'll jog  The cadge to weigh  The sheets belay  He does it with a wish  To heave the lead  Or to cathead  The pond'rous anchor fish  For while the grog goes round  All sense of danger drown'd  We despise it to a man  We sing a little and laugh a little  And work a little and swear a little  And fiddle a little and foot it a little  And swig the flowing can  II  If howling winds and roaring seas  Give proof of coming danger  We view the storm our hearts at ease  For Jack's to fear a stranger  Bless'd with the smiling grog we fly  Where now below  We headlong go  Now rise on mountains high  Spight of the gale  We hand the sail  Or take the needful reef  Or man the deck  To clear some wreck  To give the ship relief  Though perils threat around  All sense of danger's drown'd  We despise it to a man  We sing a little c  III  But yet think not our fate is hard  Though storms at sea thus treat us  For coming home a sweet reward  With smiles our sweethearts greet us  Now too the friendly grog we quaff  Our am'rous toast  Her we love most  And gayly sing and laugh  The sails we furl  Then for each girl  The petticoat display  The deck we clear  Then three times cheer  As we their charms survey  And then the grog goes round  All sense of danger drown'd  We despise it to a man  We sing a little c  CATCH  IN THE BYSTANDER  HERE lies a philosopher knowing and brave  From whom Madam Nature ne'er hid the least wonder  Who looking to heaven tumbled into his grave  And disdain'd that same earth where he rotting lies under  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  AWAY and join the rendezvous  Good fellowship reigns here  Joys standard flying in your view

THE ODDITIES  To Bachelor's Hall we good fellows invite  To partake of the chase that makes up our delight  We have spirits like fire and of health such a stock  That our pulse strikes the seconds as true as a clock  Did you see us you'd swear as we mount with a grace  That Diana had dubb'd some new gods of the chase  Hark away hark away all nature looks gay  And Aurora with smiles ushers in the bright day  II  Dick Thickset came mounted upon a fine black  A better fleet gelding ne'er hunter did back  Tom Trig rode a bay full of mettle and bone  And gayly Bob Buxom rode proud on a roan  But the horse of all horses that rivall'd the day  Was the squire's NeckorNothing and that was a grey  Hark away c  III  Then for hounds there was Nimble so well that climbs rocks  And Cocknose a good one at scenting a fox  Little Plunge like a mole who will ferret and search  And beetlebrow'd Hawk'seye so dead at a lurch  Young Slylooks who scents the strong breeze from the south  And musical Echowell with his deep mouth  Hark away c  IV  Our horses thus all of the very best blood  'Tis not likely you'll easily find such a stud  And for hounds our opinions with thousands we'd back  That all England

by strong chords  Hymen's chains tho' they gall yet with ecstasy strike  Exactly like discords and concords  Like hooting of owls and of bats on the wing  Strife all wedding happiness garbles  But when hearts born for pleasure in unison sing  'Tis the mellowton'd nightingale warbles  II  When the wife or the husband a note sounds too sharp  In alt both immediately soar  On family discords they mutually harp  Nor will either come down a note lower  They like c  III  All harmony's powers in wedlock we trace  Dutch harmony not Italiano  She thunders the counter he grumbles the bass  And the

 So tender artless and so young  I listened to his flatt'ring tongue  Nor did I e'er  Suspect a snare  From one who went to sea  For sailors kind and honest are  They injured virtue make their care  One only one did e'er depart  From that prov'd rule and he  Ah me  Was born to break my simple heart  Alas c  When absent from my longing arms  Each hour was fraught with new alarms  Each rising morn beheld my tears  The softest breeze in my fond fears  Did the horizon straight deform  And Zephyr grew into a storm  Yet to be cheated of my bliss  And was I then so kind for this  Alas c  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  How much I love thee girl would'st know  Better than rosin loves the bow  Than treble shrill the growling bass  Or spruce guitars a tawdry case  No more then let us solo play  To Hymen's temple jig away  There when we get  In a duet  Of pleasure will we take our swing  Joy's fiddles shall play  Love's bells shall ring  And while we celebrate the day  We'll frisk away  And laugh and play  And dance and sing  And frisk away like any thing  II  I love thee more I really think  Than dancers jigs or fiddlers drink  Than dancingmasters love a kit  Or jolly sailors fal dral tit  No

THE wind was hush'd the fleecy wave  Scarcely the vessel's sides could lave  When in the mizen top his stand  Tom Clueline taking spied the land  Oh what reward for all his toil  Once more he views his native soil  Once more he thanks indulgent fate  That brings him to his bonny Kate  II  Soft as the sighs of Zephyr flow  Tender and plaintive as her woe  Serene was the attentive eve  That heard Tom's bonny Kitty grieve  ' Oh what avails' cried she 'my pain  ' He's swallow'd in the greedy main  ' Ah never shall I welcome home  ' With tender joy my honest Tom'  III  Now high upon the faithful shroud  The land awhile that seemed a cloud  While objects from the mist arise  A feast presents Tom's longing eyes  A ribband near his heart which lay  Now see him on his hat display  The given sign to shew that fate  Had brought him safe to bonny Kate  IV  Near to a cliff whose heights command  A prospect of the shelly strand  While Kitty fate and fortune blamed  Sudden with rapture she exclaimed  ' But see oh heaven a ship in view  ' My Tom appears among the crew  ' The pledge he swore to bring safe home  ' Streams on his hat'tis honest Tom  V  What now remains were easy told  Tom comes his pockets lined with gold  Now rich enough no more to roam  To serve his king he stays at home  Recounts each toil and shews each scar  While Kitty and her constant tar  With rev'rence teach

Should call me a fox much rather  I be silent and sly  And cunning and dry  And with a hawk's eye  To watch what's said and done am ready  So they that goes to hope  To hang me for a fool  Will find in the rope  A knave that he wool  So you never must  To faces trust  For I be sly  And queer and dry  And they that thinks to make a fool of I  Are all deceived in little Neddy  II  When the comely captain on his knees I find  Who to mother has vowed and has kiss'd her  Why 'tis nothing more than kind after kind  For the dancingmaster kisses sister  So they thinks me to chouse  While I goes about the house  As tame as a mouse  By the nick name of simple Teddy  But 'tis all one to me  If in day time d'ye see  They meets their spark  I kiss maids in the dark  So you never must  To faces

morning saw them parting  While each the other's sorrow dried  They by the tear that then was starting  Vow'd to be constant till they died  II  At distance from his Anna's beauty  While howling winds the sky deform  Ben sighs and well performs his duty  And braves for love the frightful storm  Alas in vain the vessel batter'd  On a rock splitting opens wide  While lacerated torn and shatter'd  Ben thought of Anna sighed and died  III  The semblance of each charming feature  That Ben had worn around his neck  Where art stood substitute for nature  A tar his friend saved from the wreck  In fervent hope while Anna burning  Blushed as she wished to be a bride  The portrait came joy turn'd to mourning  She saw grew pale sunk down and died  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  Abergavney is fine

now luff me as your life  And Taffy and Griddy shall soon be man and wife  II  The mountains are high and the fallies are low  And from Radnor to Glamorgan's a long fay to co  But I'd co and I'd run

 The bell proclaim'd night's awful noon  And scarce a ripple shook the sea  When thus for sailors nature's care  What education has denied  Are of strong sense a bounteous share  By observation well supplied  While thus in bold and honest guise  For wisdom mov'd his tongue  Drawing from wisdom comfort's drop  In truth and fair reflection wise  Right cheerfully sung  Little Ben that keeps his watch in the main top  II  Why should the hardy tar complain  'Tis certain true he weathers more  From dangers on the roaring main  Than lazy lubbers do ashore  Ne'er let the noble mind despair  Though roaring seas run mountains high  All things are built with equal care  First rate or wherry man or fly  If there's a power that never errs  And certainly 'tis so  For honest hearts what comforts drop  As well as kings and emperors  Why not take in tow  Little Ben that keeps his watch in the main top  III  What though to distant climes I roam  Far from my darling Nancy's charms  The sweeter is my welcome home  To blissful moorings in her arms  Perhaps she on that sober moon  A lover's observation takes  And longs that little Ben may soon  Relieve that heart which sorely achs  Ne'er fear that power that never errs  That guards all things below  For honest hearts what comforts drop  As well as kings and emperors  Will surely take in tow  Little Ben that keeps his watch in

ass  Love cannot vie with those sweet joys  That crown the sparkling glass  II  To plunge in care let lovers whine  Such fools who will be may  Good fellows glass in hand combine  To drive pale care away  With grief of heart how many a boy  Goes mad to please some lass  We too go mad but 'tis with joy  Fired by the sparkling glass  III  How many dangle on a tree  Who buckle to love's tether  True to our honest purpose we  Hang too but 'tis together  The lover numbers by his sighs  The moments as they pass  We count them in a way more wise  By putting round the glass  IV  See in his cage the

 Seeks Bacchus and his glass  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  OF the ancients is't speaking my soul you be after  Dat they never got how come you so  Would you sariously make the good folks die with laughter  To be sure their dog's tricks we don't know  Wid your smalliliow nonsense and all your queer bodderns  Since whisky's a liquor divine  Do be sure the old ancients as well as the moderns  Did not love

So adieu to the white cliffs of Briton  Our girls and our dear native shore  For if some hard rock we should split on  We shall never see them any more  But sailor's were born for all weathers  Great guns let it blow high blow low  Our duty keeps us to our tethers  And where the gale drives we must go  II  When we entered the gut of Gibralter  I verily thought she'd have sunk  For the wind so

hundred that sailed never landed  But I and I think twentytwo  But sailors c  V  After thus we at sea had miscarried  Another guess way sat the wind  For to England I came and got married  To a lass

the flats and sharps now a tedious journey travel  Then lose yourself in knots of chords  And then those knots unravel  Then sigh and die  And faint in bliss extatic  And then the half tones try  For a touch of the chromatic  Then where you set out come again  And nowyou're welcome home again  Then once more the melody  To take in all the flats  Then change your drift  And suddenly  Prepare to

 Still changing wrong and right  The application's prompt and ripe  I of all nature am the type  So turn me round  I shall be found  From right to left and left to right  Look how you will  To vary

I'm resolved and who'd wager 'gainst that  Were it even a guinea he'd lose  I told the young baggage says I to her face  Toy as much as you will but no priest shall say grace  II  Cry'd young Thyrsis pray Colin this blustering hold  What you've utter'd is only through fear  In the absence of danger all cowards feel bold  But you'd soon change your tone were she near  She has honour and truth and I say't to your face  With her you'll ne'er toy till the priest shall say grace  III  Away then cried Colin a soldier I'll go  In each quarter to find out a wife  I'll roar and I'll rant rake a little or so  But no one shall snap me for life  For in spight of their fancies I'll say't to their face  Toy as much as you will but no priest shall say grace  IV  As he utter'd those words charming Chloe came by  Unaffected and lovely as May  Adieu then poor Colin cried she with a sigh  While the sun shines begone and make hay  Cried Thyrsis d'ye hear you may well hide your face  With such beauty would'st toy till the priest should say grace  V  Odd rot it cried Colin woot let me alone  With vexation my heart how it boils  Why for her peace of mind I would forfeit my own  Woot forgive me sweet ChloeShe smiles  See see glad consent lightens up in her face  Then let us to church where the priest shall say grace  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  WHAT thof I be a country clown  For all the fuss that you make  One need not to be born in town  To know what two and two make  'Squire Fop there thinks his empty pate  Worth all ours put together  But how can that have any weight  That's only made of feather  Then duont ye be so proud d'ye see  It 'ent a thing that's suiting  Can one than t' other better be  When both are on a footing  II  Now here's a man who seas and land  Has dreamt that he can cross over  That all the world's at his command  For he's a great philosopher  That to each secret he no bars  E'er finds but can unlock it  And conjure down the moon and stars  And put them in his pocket  But when you've caught him where's the prize  So mighty to the getter  For sartin he can make us wise  But can he make us better  III  My lady there because she's dress'd  In lappets frils and flounces  See how with pride her flutt'ring breast  Throbs heaves and jumps and bounces  And then 'tis said they makes a face  New spick and span each feature  As if they thought that a disgrace  That's ready made by nature  The money for a head so high  Such scollops and such carving  Would keep an honest family  A month or more from starving  IV  As for the doctors and their pill  Odds waunds I can't endure them  For sartin they their patients kill  More oftner than they cure them  And as for master poet here  Who writes for fame and glory  I thinks as he's a little queer  Poor soul in the upper story  I've yet another wipe to spare  For waunds I'll give no quarter  Next time you'd find a fool take care  You do not catch a tarter  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  To look upon dress upon shew upon birth  As the noblest distinctions of life  On riches as all that give pleasure on earth  And that only cure sorrow and strife  And though to the maxims one might say  quoi bon  Yet this is the life of a lady of ton  Stale virtue and vice to erase from their list  Those of life make a pitiful part  Things certainly in people's mouths that exist  But have nothing to do with the heart  To maxims like these one may well say  quoi bon  Yet this is the life of a lady of ton  III  Upon prudence as vulgar and honesty low  On each man of merit a brute  As an angel an ape or 'tis all one a beau  Dressed out in an elegant suit  To maxims like these one may well say  quoi bon  Yet this is the life of a lady of ton  IV  To be shortin a church as the best place to make  Appointments or charms to display  And the time most commode of all others to take  On Sunday for cheating at play  These maxims 'tis certain  ne sont pas trop bon  Yet this is the life of a lady of

More than could lucky I  My cot was snug well fill'd my cag  My grunter in the sty  With wherry tight  And bosom light  I cheerfully did row  And to complete this princely life  Sure never man had friend and wife  Like my Poll and my partner Joe  II  I roll'd in joys like these awhile  Folks far and near caress'd me  Till woe is me  So lubberly  The pressgang came and press'd me  How could I all these pleasures leave  How with my wherry part  I never so took on to grieve  It wrung my very heart  But when on board  They gave the word  To foreign parts to go  I rued the moment I was born  That ever I should thus be torn  From my Poll and my partner Joe  III  I did my duty manfully  While on the billows rolling  And night or day  Could find my way  Blindfold to the maintop bowling  Thus all the dangers of the main  Quicksands and gales of wind  I brav'd in hopes to taste again  The joys I left behind  In climes afar  The hottest war  Pour'd broadsides on the foe  In hopes these perils to relate  As by my side attentive sate  My Poll and my partner Joe  At last it pleas'd his majesty  To give peace to the nation  And honest hearts  From foreign parts  Came home for consolation  Like lightningfor I felt new life  Now safe from all alarms  I rush'd and found my friend and wife  Lock'd in each others arms  Yet fancy not  I bore my lot  Tame like a lubderNo  For seeing I was finely trick'd  Plump to the devil I fairly kick'd  My Poll and my partner Joe  BALLAD  COTCHELIN sat all alone  Devil a soul beside her  While from Taddy who was gone  Oceans did divide her  His pipes which she'd been used to hear  Careless left behind him  She thought she'd try her woes to cheer  Till once again she'd fine him  'Twill not do you loodle loo  Arrah now be aesy  Tad was born with grief to make  Cotchelin run crazy  II  She takes them up and lays them down  And now her bosom's panting  And now she'd sigh and now she'd frown  Caze why dere's something wanting  And now she plays the pipes again  The pipes of her dear Taddy  And makes them tune his favourite strain  Arrah be aesy Paddy  Ah 'twill not do you loodle loo  Arrah now be aesy  Tad was born with grief to make  Cotchelin run crazy  III  Taddy from behind a bush  Where he'd long been listening  Now like light'ning forth did rush  His eyes with pleasure glistening  Snatching up the pipes he play'd  Pouring out his pleasure  While half delighted half afraid  Pat the time did measure  Ah well will do this loodle loo  Arrah now be aesy  Tad was born with joy to make  Cotchelin run crazy  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  HERE a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling  The carling of our crew  No more he'll hear the tempest howling  For death has broach'd him to  His form was of the manliest beauty  His heart was kind and soft  Faithful below he did his duty  And now he's gone aloft  II  Tom never from his word departed  His virtues were so rare  His friends were many and true hearted  His Poll was kind and fair  And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly  Ah many's the time and oft  But mirth is turn'd to melancholy  For Tom is gone aloft  III  Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather  When he who all commands  Shall give to call life's crew together  The word to pipe all hands  Thus death who kings and tars despatches  In vain Tom's life has doff'd  For though his body's under hatches  His soul is
