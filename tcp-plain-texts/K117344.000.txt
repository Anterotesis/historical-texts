 THE JOURNEY FROM CHESTER TO LONDON  EAST GATE CHESTER  LONDON Printed for B WHITE Fleet Street MDCCLXXXII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE ground which is described in the following Sheets has been for some

very commodious building has been erected in the  Yatchfield  near the  Watergate  street for the sale of the  Irish  linen at the two fairs It surrounds a large square area on each side of which are piazzas with numbers of shops well adapted for the purpose  IN digging the foundation for certain houses near the street were discovered some  Roman  buildings and a large  Hypocaust  with its several conveniences and some other antiquities par∣ticularly a beautiful altar  Engraven in  Moses Griffith  's Supplemental Plates to the Tours in  Wales  tab X  dedicated  Fortunae Reduci  et  Aesculapio  Much of its inscription is defaced but the rudder cornucopia rod serpent and various sacrificial instruments are in good pre∣servation  ON leaving the city I passed under the fine arch of the East Gate a work owing to the munificence of Lord  Grosvenor  Boughton  BOUGHTON  a suburb in the parish of St  Oswald  a little dis∣joined from this part of the city had before the dissolution an hospital  Tanner    for poor lepers as early as the beginning of  Edward  II From an eminence the retreat of the unfortunate brave is a view of very uncommon beauty of two fine reaches of the  Dee  bounded on one part by meadows and hanging woods on the other terminated by part of the city the antient bridge and over it a distant view of the  Cambrian hills  ADJOINING to that part of  Boughton  which is within the liber∣ties of the city is the township of  Boughton  in the county of  Chester  the inhabitants of which appear at the court of the dean and chapter of  Chester  and pay there a chief rent but usually clame and dispose of the wastes  NEAR the two miles stone I crossed the canal to  Christleton  a pretty village seated as usual with those of  Cheshire  on the free∣stone rock  Cristetone  as it is called in the  Doomsday  book was held before the Conquest by Earl  Edwin  At that event pro∣bably it had a chapel or very soon after This manor had been bestowed by  Hugh Lupus  on  Robert Fitz Hugh  one of his follow∣ers who gave the chapel of  Cristentune  with the land belonging to it and the land of a certain peasant with the peasant himself to the abbey of  Chester  Dugdale  Mon i  His great great granddaughter  Isabel  wife of Sir  Philip Burnet  joined with her husband in suing the abbey for this and some other contiguous manors It is pro∣bable that the monks might have taken an advantage of a fit of  remorse for some crime or the weakness of an illness to obtain this gift from her ancestor They thought fit to compromise the matter with her and on payment of two hundred pounds re∣ceived in the ninth of  Edward  I a confirmation of the grant and at the same time full liberty was given to the abbot to make a reservoir of water and to convey it to the abbey  IN the year  FREE WARREN  William de Birmingham  had  free warren  given him of all his demesne lands in this village but it is appre∣hended he was only an inferior lord to the paramount privileges of the abbey In the  Saxon  times every man was allowed to kill game on his own estate but on the Conquest the king vested the property of all the game in himself so that no one could sport even on his own land under most cruel penalties without permission from the king by grant of a chase or  free warren  By this the grantee had an exclusive power of killing game on his own estate but it was on condition that he prevented every one else so that as our learned commentator  Judge BLACKSTONE  observes this seeming favor was intended for the preservation of the beasts and fowls of  warren  which were roes hares and rabbits partridge rails and quails woodcocks and pheasants mallards and herons for the sport of our savage monarchs This liberty which they allowed to a few individuals being designed merely to prevent a general destruction  Christleton  passed from the  Birminghams  in  Richard  II's time to Sir  Hugh Brower  Sir  Hugh  lost it by his attachment to the house of  York  and  Henry  the IVth in the fourth year of his reign be∣stowed it on  John Manwaring  of  Over Peover  an attendant on his  son afterwards  Henry  V  Leicester      Manwaring  having no lawful issue bestowed this place on Sir  Thomas le Grosvenor  lord of  Hulme  but it passed immediately from him to  John de Macclesfield  in the th of  Henry  V One of his descendants alienated it in or the st of  Henry  VI to  Humphrey  afterward Duke of  Buck∣ingham Henry  Lord  Stafford  son to  Edward  Duke of  Bucking∣ham  sold it to Sir  William Sneyde  of  Keel  and Sir  Ralph Sneyde  to Sir  John Harpur  of  Swerston  in  Derbyshire  one of whose de∣scendants sold it to  Thomas Brock  Esquire the present lord of the manor The living is a rectory in the disposal of Sir  Roger Mostyn  the church dedicated to St  James  FROM hence I took the horseroad across  Brownheath  by  Hoc∣kenball  formerly the seat of a family of the same name The rising country to the left of this road appears to great advantage opposing to the traveller a fair front beautifully clumped with selfplanted groves  PASSED over a brook and reached the small town of  Tarvin  which still retains nearly its  British  name  Terfŷn  or the  Boundary  and is so to the forest of  Delamere  In Doomsday book it is stiled  Terve  the bishop at that time held it It then contained six taxable hides of land The bishop kept on it six cowmen three radmen seven villeyns seven boors and six ploughlands The first were to keep his cattle the second to attend his person in his travels or to go wheresoever he pleased to send them the third by their tenure to cultivate his lands and the fourth to supply his table with poultry eggs and other small matters The  ploughland  or  caruca  was as much as one plough could  work in the year This shews the establishment of a manor in those early times which I mention now to prevent repetition  IN  Henry  VI's time the village and manor were estimated at £ a year and were held by  Reginald  bishop of  Lichfield  in the same manner as they were held by his predecessors under the  Prince of Wales  as earl of  Chester  They continued possessed by them till the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  when they were alienated to Sir  John Savage  who procured for the town the privilege of a market The church is a rectory and still continues part of the see of  Lichfield  being a prebendary originally founded about the year by  Alexander de Stavenby  bishop of that diocese It is valued at £  s    d  the highest endowment of any prebend in that cathedral It is called the prebend of  Tarvin  which presents to the living  THE same prelate also bestowed this church on the vicepre∣bendal church of  Burton  in  Wiral  Anglia Sacra i  and formed out of its reve∣nues an hospital for shipwrecked persons This hospital was pro∣bably at  Burton Tarvin  being too remote from the sea for so hu∣mane a design  AGAINST the churchwall is a monument in memory of Mr  John Thomasine  thirtysix years master of the grammarschool The epitaph deservedly celebrates the performances of this ex∣quisite penman as  highly excelling in all the varieties of writ∣ing and wonderfully so in the  Greek  characters Specimens of his ingenuity are treasured up not only in the cabinets of the curious but in public libraries throughout the kingdom He had the honour to transcribe for her Majesty Queen  Anne  the  Icon Basilike  of her royal grandfather Invaluable copies also of  Pindar Anacreon Theocritus Epictetus Hippocrates  's  Aphorisms  and that finished piece the  Shield of Achilles  as de∣scribed by  Homer  are among the productions of his celebrated pen  As his incomparable performances acquired him the esteem and patronage of the great and learned so his affability and humanity gained him the goodwill of all his acquaintance and the decease of so much private worth is regretted as a pub∣lic loss  FROM  Tarvin  I travel on the great road and at about two miles distance leave on the right  Stapleford  which retains the name it had at the Conquest when it was held by  Radulpus Venator  from  Hugh Lupus  After a long interval it fell to the  Breretons  In or the second of  Richard  II it was held by Sir  William Brereton  of the king as earl of  Chester  From that family it passed to the  Bruyns  and was purchased by the late  Randle Wil∣braham  Esquire  Two miles farther on the left stood  Utkinton Hall  the ma∣nor with  Kingsley  and the baileywick of the forest of  Delamere  was given by  Randle Meschines  earl of  Chester  to  Randle de Kingsley  whose great granddaughter  Joan  about the year conveyed it to the  Dones Richard Done  was possessed of it in the sixth of  Edward  II He held it by a quarter part of a knight's fee and the master forestership of  Mere Delamere  and  Mottram  by himself and a horseman and eight footmen under him to keep that forest then valued at £  s    d  UPON the failure of issue male of Sir  John Done  in the begin∣ning of the last century the manor of  Utkinton  came to his  daughters and has been since held by them or persons claming under them  Mary  the second daughter married in  John  second son of Sir  Randle Crew  of  Crew  and  Elinor  the younger to  Ralph Arderne  Esquire  THE  Dones  of  Flaxyard  in this neighbourhood were another considerable family at constant feud with the former till the houses were united by the nuptials of the heir of  Flaxyard  with the heiress of  Utkinton  But at this time both those antient seats are demolished or turned into farmhouses  FROM hence I soon reached  Torporley  a small town seated on a gentle descent It had once been a borough town of which  Richard Francis  was mayor in the twentieth of  Edward  I In the tenth of the same reign  Hugh de Tarpoley  had licence to hold a market here every  Tuesday  and a fair on the vigil the feastday and the day after the exaltation of the  Holy Cross  but he alienated this privilege with his property to  Reginald de Grey  chief justice of  Chester  IN the eighth of  Richard  II this manor was divided into two moieties one of which was held by  John Done  the other by  Reginald Grey  of the family of Lord  Grey  of  Ruthin  THE manor and rectory of  Torporley  are now divided into six shares four belong to the  Arderns  one to the dean and chap∣ter of  Chester  and another to  Philip Egerton  Esquire of  Oulton  THE living is a rectory in the gift of  John Ardern  Esquire The church is dedicated to St  Helen  the Empress of  Constantius  the daughter of  Coel  a  British  prince a popular saint among us if we may judge from the number of churches under her protec∣tion That in question is of no great antiquity in respect to the  building nor yet of beauty Within is much waste of good marble in monumental vanity  THE best are two monuments in the chancel seemingly copied from halflength portraits included in carved borders of marble in imitation of frames The figures are included in them in  mezzorelievo  the one of Sir  John Done  Knight hereditary fo∣rester and keeper of the forest of  Delamere  who died in His figure is picturesque in a laced jacket and a horn in his hand the badge of his office which horn descended to the different owners of the estate and is now in the possession of  John Ardern  Esquire  WHEN that  Nimrod James  I made a progress in he was entertained by this gentleman at  Utkinton  who ordered so  wisely  and  contentfully  says  King  Vale Royal ii  his Highness's sports that  James  conferred on him the honor of knighthood  He married  Dorothy  daughter of  Thomas Wilbraham  Esquire of  Woodhey  who left behind her so admirable a character that to this day when a  Cheshire  man would express some excellency in one of the fair sex he would say  There is Lady Done for you  The other is of  John Crew  Esquire second son of Sir  Randle Crew  of  Crew  Knight married to  Mary  daughter of Sir  John Done  His face is represented in profile with long hair He died  His lady and her elder sister  Jane Done  an antient virgin lie at full length in the  Utkinton  chapel with long and excellent cha∣racters One lies recumbent the other reclined and strait laced  which give little grace in statuary  Jane  died in Mrs  Crew  in aged  SIR  John Crew  Knight son of Mr  John Crew  lies reclined on an altartomb with a vast perriwig and a  Roman  dress with a whimpering genius at head and feet Sir  John  married first  Mary  daughter of  Thomas Wagstaff  of  Tachbrook  in  Warwick∣shire  Esquire and for his second  Mary  daughter of Sir  Wil∣lughby Aston  of  Aston  Baronet He died in aged  I MUST not quit this place without letting fall a few tears as a tribute to the memory of its honest rector  John Allen  whose an∣tiquarian knowlege and hospitality I have often experienced on this great thoroughfare to the capital From the antient recto∣rial house at the bottom of the town is an aweful view of the great rock of  Beeston  backed by the  Peckfreton  hills tempting me to take a nearer survey  THE distance is about two miles In my way I crossed the canal at  Beeston Bridge  and called at the poor remains of  Beeston Hall  the manorhouse inhabited by the agent for the estate This place was burnt by prince  Rupert  during the civil wars There is a tradition that he had dined that day with the lady of the house After dinner he told her that he was sorry that he was obliged to make so bad return to her hospitality advised her to secure any valuable effects she had for he must order the house to be burnt that night least it should be garrisoned by the enemy  THIS manor had been part of the barony of  Malpas  and was held under the lords by the family of  De Bunbury  who changed their  Norman  name  St Pierre  and assumed that of the place where they first settled  IN or the fiftysixth of  Henry  III  Henry de Bunbury  and  Margery  his wife gave it to their nephew  Richard  who made the place his residence and assumed its name It continued in his family for many generations Sir  George Beeston  possessed it in the fortyfourth of Queen  Elizabeth  At length by the marriage of  Margaret  daughter of Sir  Hugh Beeston  with  William White∣more  of  Leighton  it was conveyed into that house and as sud∣denly transferred by  Bridget  heiress of Mr  Whitemore  to  Darcie Savage  second son to  Thomas  Viscount  Savage  of  Rock Savage  whose granddaughter another  Bridget  brought it by marriage to Sir  Thomas Mostyn  Baronet with the lordships of  Peckfreton Leighton  and  Thornton  in whose house they still remain This lady was a  Roman Catholic  Tradition is warm in her praise and full of her domestic virtues and the particular attention that she shewed in obliging her domestics of each religion to attend their respective churches Her husband and she were lovely and plea∣sant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they died within a day or two of each other at  Gloddaeth  in  Caernar∣vonshire  and were interred in the neighboring church of  Eglwys Rbôs  AT a small distance from the hall is the great insulated rock of  Beeston  composed of sandstone very lofty and precipitous at one end and sloped down into the flat country at the other Its height from  Beeston Bridge  to the summit is three hundred and sixtysix feet From the summit is a most extensive view on every part except where interrupted by the  Peckfreton  hills The land appears deeply indented by the estuary of the  Dee  and  Mer∣sey  and the canal from  Chester  appears a continued slender line of water from that city to almost the base of this eminence To this  BEESTON CASTLE  place its utility has been proved to all the marketwomen of the neighboring farmers who have the benefit of  Treckschuyts  to con∣vey their merchandize to their capital a few coals also come up and a little timber and these form the sum of their present commerce  THIS rock is crowned with the ruins of a strong fortress  BEESTON CASTLE  which rose in the year founded by  Randle Blondeville  earl of  Chester  on his return out of the  Holy Land  for which purpose and for the building of  Chartley Castle  he raised a tax upon all his estates  Polychronicon cccvi  At that time it belonged to the lords of the manor of  Beeston  from whom he obtained leave to erect his castle It de∣volved afterwards to the crown for according to  Erdeswick  Polychronicon  cccvi  r  Hugh Beeston  purchased it from Queen  Elizabeth  and restored it to his lordship  It had been a place of very great strength The access about midway of the slope was defended by a great gateway and a strong wall fortified with round towers which ran from one edge of the precipice to the other across the slope but never sur∣rounded the hill as is most erroneously represented in the old prince Some of the walls and about six or seven rounders still  ist A square tower part of the gateway is also standing  th  n this cincture is a large  area  perhaps four or five acres in  xtent Near the top is the castle defended on this side by an amazing ditch cut out of the live rock on the other by the  upt precipice that hangs over the vale of  Cheshire  THE entrance is through a noble gateway guarded on each  e by a great rounder whose walls are of a prodigious thick∣ness  Within the yard is a rectangular building the chapel of the place The drawwell was of a most surprizing depth being sunk through the higher part of the rock to the level of  Beeston  brook that runs beneath In the area just mentioned was an∣other well both at this time are filled up but  King  remem∣bered the first to have been eighty the other ninetyone yards deep although the last is said to have been half filled with stones and rubbish  WE are quite unacquainted with the events that befel this strong hold for several centuries after its foundation  Slow  A  ais    says that  Richard  II lodged here his great treasures during his expe∣dition into  Ireland  and garrisoned it with an hundred men of arms chosen and able who on the approach of  Henry  duke of  Lancester  yielded it to the usurper But other historians assert his treasures were placed in the castle of  Holt  THE fortress certainly fell in ruins soon after this reign for  Ireland  in his poem on the birth of  Edward  VI speaks of it as such when he makes  Fome  to alight on its summit and foretell its restoration  E  plicuit dehine FANA suas perniciter alas  Altaque fulmia  Jovis atria victrix  Circuiens liquidi spatiosa volumina coeli  Tum quoque duspexit terram sublimis ocellcs  Sidereos sigens  Bisduni  in moenia casiri  c  Thence to  Jove  's palace  she  prepared to fly  With outstretch'd pi  ons thro' the yielding sky  Wide o'er the  of the ample space  Survey'd the subject earth and human race  Ta'e Ro  al  iii  Sublime in air she cast her radiant eyes  Where farfam'd  Beeston  's airy turrets rise  High on a rock it stood whence all around  Each fruitful valley and each rising ground  In beauteous prospect lay these scenes to view  Descending swift the wondering goddess flew  Perched on the topmost pinnacle she shook  Her sounding plumes and thus in rapture spoke  From  Syrian  climes the conquering  Randolph  came  "Whose wellfought fields bear record of his name  "To guard his country and to check his foes  "By  Randolph  's hands this glorious fabric rose  "Tho' now in ruin'd heaps thy bulwarks lie  "Revolving time shall raise those bulwarks high  "If faith to antient prophecies be due  "Then  Edward  shall thy pristine state renew"  R W  The castle was restored to its former strength between the days of  Leland  and the sad contentions betwixt the king and parle∣ment in the times of  Charles  I It was first possessed by the par∣lement  SI  G    but on the th of  September  was taken by the royalists under the famous partizan Captain  Sandford  who scaled the steep sides of the rock and took it by surprize  Genethliacon Eaduardi  Pr  Walliae  L    Steel  the governor was suspected of treachery tried and shot to death  THE parlement made a vigorous attempt to recover a place of such importance and besieged it for seventeen weeks during which time it was gallantly defended by Captain  Valet  At length on the approach of prince  Rupert  the enemy abandoned the attack on the th of  March    MS account Mr  Grose  article  Beeston    IN the following year it was taken after a most vigorous de∣fence of eighteen weeks The defendants were reduced to the necessity of eating cats c when the brave Colonel  Ballard  out of mere compassion to the poor remains of his garrison consented to beat a parley and obtained the most honorable conditions far beyond what would be expected in such extremity  viz  to march out the governor and officers with their horses and arms and their own proper goods which loaded two waggons the com∣mon soldiers with colors flying drums beating matches alight aproportion of cannon and ball and a convoy to guard them to  Flint Castle  On  Sunday  the th of  March  he surrendered the castle to Sir  William Brereton  and according to articles marched out with his men now reduced to about sixty  Rushworth  vol i part p  The fortress soon after underwent the fate of the other seats of loyalty  FROM  Beeston Castle  I continued my journey about two miles to  Bunbury  a village  BUNBURY  and the seat of the parish church This was the  Boliberie  of  Doomsday Book  which with several neigh∣boring places in the antient hundred of  Riseton  now compre∣hended in that of  Ledesbury  were possessed by  Robert Fitzhugh  The family who assumed the name of the place held it under him and his successors till  Humphrey  dying without issue his sis∣ters  Ameria  and  Joan  became coheiresses  Ameria  's share came to the  Patricks  and from them to the  St Piers  At length  Isa∣bel  daughter and heiress of  Uriam St Pier  brought it by mar∣riage to Sir  Walter  who sold his share of the ad∣vowson of the church to the famous Sir  Hugh de Calvely Joan  's moiety came to her son  Alexander  who still continued the name  De Bunbury  Sir  Hugh de Calvely  obtaining likewise  the other share of the church erected here a college for a master and six chaplains for which purpose he obtained li∣cence dated  March  th from  Richard  II on paying to the king the sum of forty pounds It was instituted for the good state of the  King  and of Sir  Hugh  as long as they lived and on their death for the souls of them and their progenitors and those of all the faithful  Dugdale Monast  iii part p  Its revenue was an hundred marks but at the dissolution was £  s    d  when the foundation consisted of a dean five vicars and two choristers  IN the fourteenth of Queen  Elizabeth  it was purchased of the crown by  Thomas Aldersey  of  London  merchanttaylor a second son of the house of  Spurstow  in this parish Here he founded a preacher's place of marks a year with a good house and glebe an assistant or curate with £ a year the other for an usher  A schoolmaster with £ a year  with £ ten pounds a year to the poor and se∣veral other charitable gifts The disposal of the places here are in the haberdashers company  London  King's Vale Royal  ii  IN respect to the succession of the manor Sir  Thomas Cokesey  in the latter end of the reign of  Henry  VII having no issue alienated his share to the  Bunburies  In the thirtysecond of  Henry  VIII  Richard Bunbury  was lord of the manor from whom the family of the  Bunburies  of  Stanny  in  Wirral  and the present Sir  Charles  is lineally descended  THE church is a handsome building embattled  CHURCH  and the tower ornamented with pinnacles The architecture seems of the time of  Henry  VII It is dedicated to St  Boniface  from whom the  place takes its name Whether the patron was  Boniface  an  Englishman  first archbishop of  Mentz  who died in or Pope  Boniface  the First who died in I cannot determine for both received their  apotheosis  THE church is distinguished by the magnificent tomb of Sir  Hugh de Calvely  TOMB  whose effigies in white marble lies on it recum∣bent He is armed in the fashion of the times and to give an idea of his vast prowess his figure is represented seven feet and a half long He was the  Arthur  of  Cheshire  the glory of the county accordingly the most prodigious seats are recorded of him Whe∣ther like  Milo  he could kill a bull with a blow of his fist is not said but our ballads give Sir  Hugh  no more than the honor of devouring a calf at a meal His head rests on a helmet with a calf's head for the crest allusive to his name yet probably gave rise to the fable  Sir  Hugh  sprung from a neighboring hamlet of which I shall have occasion to speak from whence he took his surname Ac∣cording to the cast of the times he fought adventures in the mi∣litary line and like a soldier of fortune first appeared a princi∣pal commander of the  Grandes Compagnies Tard venus  or  Malan∣drins  a species of  banditti  formed out of the disbanded soldiery of different nations On the captivity of king  John  at the battle of  Poitiers  they amounted at lest to above forty thousand veteran troops They lived upon plunder yet were ready to join the side most adverse to  France  At the battle of  Auray  in Sir  Hugh  Froissart  i ch ccxxvi  served with a considerable body of them under the  English  general Lord  Chandos  and had the honor of turning the fortune of the day in which was taken the great  De Gueselin  IN Sir  Hugh  was won over by that illustrious general again at the head of the armies of  France  to join him in an expe∣dition into  Spain  to dethrone  Peter  the Cruel king of  Castile  The enterprize was successful but on the express command of  Edward  III to Lord  Chandos  Sir  Hugh de Calvely  and others of his subjects leaders of the companies to forbear hostilities  Rymer  vi  against  Peter  they deserted the quarrel they had espoused and on the appearance of the  Black Prince  in  Spain  who to his dis∣grace took part with the tyrant Sir  Hugh  and a great body of the companies joined him The prince reinstated  Peter  on the throne after the great victory of  Najara  over his rival  Henry  of  Trastamare  to which the bravery of Sir  Hugh  and his troops was highly contributory On the recall of the  Black Prince  by his father in Sir  Hugh  was left commander of the com∣panies History gives him a royal consort in reward of his va∣lour and marries him to the queen of  Arragon  If at this pe∣riod he took a most antiquated piece of royalty for I can find no other dowager of that kingdom unless  Leonora  relict of  Alonso  IV who became a widow in was then alive There was no issue by this match  Salusbury Pedigrees    but by his second wife heiress to  Mottram  Lord of  Mottram  his line was continued  IN the last year of  Edward  III he was appointed to the important government of  Calais  Hist Calais  ii  In he plundered and burnt  La Bas Bentagne  with several vessels which lay in har∣bour he also retook the castle of  Mark  lost before by neglect In he resigned the place to the earl of  Salusbury  and was appointed by  Richard  II admiral of his fleet  Rymer  vii    In we find him governor of  Guernsey  and the adjacent isles The last mention we find of him is in a cause that was to be determined in  Ryneer  vii  after which history is silent in respect to this hero  Fuller  remarks  It was as impossible for such a spirit not to  be  as not to be active  probably oldage might subdue his enterprizing soul for I find that he lived to the reign of  Henry  IV  Two visitations of  Cheshire  c MSS in my possession one in the other in  but mention is made of the weak state of his body in  Rymer  's record of the cause  This satisfies me that his royal consort was not  Syhilla Fortia  relict of  Perdo  fourth king of  Arragon  who lost her spouse in as was suggested to me by a most ingenious friend    THIS tomb is kept always very neat which is owing to the piety of Dame  Mary Calveley  of  Lea  who in left the in∣terest of an hundred pounds to be distributed annually among certain poor of this parish on condition they attended divine ser∣vice while they were able and swept the chancel and cleaned the monument  THE  Ridley  chapel founded in belonging to the  Egertons  of  Ridley  is separated from the church by a woodwork skreen painted This had been their place of interment but nothing monumental remains unless the impression of a plate of a kneel∣ing man against one of the walls  IN the chancel is a recumbent figure of Sir  George Beeston  who died in This monument was erected by his son Sir  Hugh  the last male of this antient line who for some time survived his only son  George  He died in  AT a small distance from  Bunbury  I fell into the great road opposite to  Alpram  a hamlet whose name is corrupted from the  Saxon Alburgham  in the  Doomsday  book In aftertimes it was the seat of the  Pages  now extinct  A LITTLE farther lies  Calvely  long the property of that il∣lustrious family now likewise lost The place was bestowed on a  Hugh  by  Richard Vernon  Baron of  Shipbrook  about the time of  Richard  I In  Edward  the IlI's time it came to the  Davenports  by the marriage of  Arthur  to  Catharine  daughter and heiress of  Robert de Calvely  in which family it has continued till the pre∣sent time  MY road lay along the low unpleasant lane that led towards  Nantwich  the prospect frequently deformed by the great fosses of the unfortunate canal falling in on each side of the road for it crosses at  Barbridge  and is finished from thence to  Nantwich  This was only a secondary consideration executed on the hopes of considerable profit in the carriage of salt and cheese The ori∣ginal and principal object was to continue the main trunk by  Church Minshul  to the great  Staffordshire  canal near  Middlewich  and by that means share in the freight of the goods of the oppo∣site side of the kingdom but various causes have frustrated all hopes of that benefit and this part of the plan remains un∣attempted  AT  Acton  the prospect mends a little That village  ACTON  with its handsome new church stand on a small rising and command an∣other great extent of flat beyond  Nantwich  This place  EARL MORKAR'S  before the Conquest was possessed by  Morkar  the gallant brother of the gallant earl  Edwin  last earl of  Mercia  At that time the hun∣dred it lay in was called  Warmundestreu  at present  Namptwich  Actune  as it is stiled in the  Doomsday  book was a very con∣siderable place There were eight hides of land taxable there were thirty ploughlands in the lord's demesn three two ser∣vants thirteen villeyns and fifteen boors with seven plough∣lands a mill for the use of the court  curiae  and ten acres of meadow a wood six leagues long and one broad an aery of hawks two presbyters who had a ploughland two aliens having a ploughland and a half a servant six villeyns seven boors with four ploughlands  THIS not only shews the greatness of this  Saxon  manor but that it was the seat of  Morkar  by the provision made for his sup∣port The tenants had likewise the right of pleas in the hall of their lord and one house in  Wich Nantwich  where they might make salt without interruption In the time of the Confessor the manor was valued at ten pounds a year at the Conquest at only six It may be observed once for all that the troubles oc∣casioned at that event and the ravages committed instantly sunk the value of the land  AT the Conquest this place was a member of the barony of  Wich Malhang  or  Nantwich Hugh  second lord of  Nantwich  bestowed the advowson of the living with the lands belonging on the abbey of  Cumbermere  which he had founded in  Dugdale Monast  ii    THE third or last baron had only daughters among whom the estates were divided and  Acton  sell to the share of  Alinora  the eldest whose daughter  Joan  marrying Lord  Lovel  it re∣mained in that line as late as the thirteenth of  Richard  II when it was possessed by Sir  John Lovel  It was afterwards the  property of the  Arderns  Sir  Leonard Ardorn  was lord of it in the ninth of  Henry  IV  IN the fourteenth  Henry  VII and in the thirtythird of  Henry  VIII it was in the heirs of  Ralph Ardens  In the reign of Queen  Mary  it was the property of the  Wilbrahams  of  Woodhey  in this parish and at present belongs to  Wilbraham Tollemache  Esquire by virtue of the marriage of  Grace  eldest daughter of Sir  Richard Wilbraham  Baronet with his ancestor  Lionel  earl of  Dysart  ABOUT twenty years ago  CHURCH  the steeple and roof of the church were destroyed but the whole has since been restored in a very handsome manner One monument is in good preservation not∣withstanding this church was a temporary prison after the battle of  Nantwich  in the civil wars of  Charles  I but the prisoners were of the party which respected these memorials of the dead  THE most ancient is one in St  Mary  's chapel in memory of Sir  William Manwaring  of  Over Pever  and of  Badely  in this neighborhood This knight before his departure on an expe∣dition to  Guienne  in settled his estate and next year made his will by which he bequeaths his body to this church and orders a  picture  in  alabaster  to cover his tomb He also left to the same church part of  Christ's cross  which the wife of his halfbrother had shut up in wax and a competent salary for a chap∣lain to say a competent number of masses in St  Mary  's chapel for the sake of his son for seven years when it might be sup∣posed to have been redeemed from  Purgatory  and  "The foul crimes done in his days of nature  "Were burnt and purg'd away"  After his death which happened in a magnificent tomb was erected beneath a Gothic arch with a large embattled super∣structure Under the arch lies Sir  William  in full armour with suppliant hands His head is cased in a conic helm bound with a fillet entwined with foliage From his helmet is a guard of mail which covers his neck and rises to his lips over which flow two great whiskers His head rests on a casque with an ass's head for a crest Above within the arch is a row of halflengths with a book opposite to each probably religious chaunt∣ing his  requiem  The whole is painted On the edge of the tomb was this inscription now much defaced by time  Hic jacet William Manwaring quondam dominum de Badeleye qui obiit die Veneris xx  o  ante festum Pentecostae anno Dni m  o  ccc  o  nonogessimo nono  THE tomb of Sir  Thomas Wilbraham  Baronet and his lady  Elizabeth  daughter of Sir  Roger Wilbraham  Knight and one of the Masters of Request to  James  I is very handsome Their figures are placed on an altartomb in white marble recumbent he in armour long curled hair and a turnover with one hand in his breast the other by his side Beneath him is spread a large cloak The lady has a book in one hand the other like his reclines on her breast He died in  THIS tomb is a specimen of the first deviation of the old form a greater ease of attitude began to prevail The hands which used to be erect close and suppliant here vary in the attitude and shew a dawning of the grace that reigned on the revival of sculpture In  England  monumental beauty was soon ruined by the servile copying the dress of the times by having nightgowns  TOMB in ACTON CHURCH  and flowing perriwigs cut out of the  Parian  blocks or adding the great wig to the absurdity of the  Roman  habit  THE church had been long the place of sepulture of the houses of  Woodhey  and  Badeley  The vain attention of our forefathers to posthumous honors and superstitious rites is well exemplified from the probate of the will of  William Wilbraham  of  Woodhey  who died in by which  he bequeaths his body to be bu∣ried before the image of our Lady in the chancel of the church of  Acton  and bestows x    to be laid out on a tenor bell if the parish will provide the rest but if not then the money to be laid out on a  pax  and two  cruytts  of silver to serve at the high altar on good days He further wills that white gowns be given to a poor men as also that torches be made to hold about his body the day of his burial and that a light be over him with viii tapers in the middle whereof a bigger taper should spring out also that pennydole should be given at his burial to every person that would take it  HE moreover requires his executors to buy a stone of mar∣ble to lie on him in the said chancel of  Acton  with pictures of himself and his wife and their arms also that they put out xi £ under sure keeping to pay xi  s  yearly to a welldisposed priest to sing during twenty years for him and his wife chil∣dren father and mother and all that God would be prayed for and the said service to be performed in his chapel of  Woodhey  which priest should likewise have iv £ more yearly for his sa∣lary if so be his heir is not pleased to give him his board and chamberroom  Collins's Baronets  ed vol ii    THE monument alluded to either never was executed or was destroyed by the fall of the steeple  FROM  Acton  I went down a gentle descent to  Nantwich  about a mile distant Antiently this place was known only by the name of  Wich  See  Skinner's Etymologicon  Notwithstanding the word does not appear to have any thing to do with salt yet  wich  or  wych  is always applied with us to places where salt is found as  Droitwich Nantwich  c and the houses in which it is made are called  wych  houses  an  AngloSaxon  word for district or habitation and a very common termination of a multitude of places Here the  British Nant  is added to shew its low situation  IMMEDIATELY before the Conquest its revenues were divided between the  king  and earl  Edwin  After that event it was be∣stowed by the great proprietor of  Cheshire Hugh Lupus  on  Wil∣liam de Malhedeng  or  de Malhang  a  Norman  chieftain from whom it was called  Wich Malhang Hugh  erected it into a barony in favor of  Malhedeng  and honored him with a seat in his par∣lement  THIS dignity continued only in him and his two sons  Hugh  and  William  The last died without issue male Of his three daughters  Alionora  the eldest by marriage of her daughter  Joan  conveyed her share to the Lord  Lovels Philippa  the second to the  Audleys  Doctor  Gower  and  Alda  the third to the  Vernons  barons of  Shipbroke  BY these marriages the barony became divided into four reckoning the part which had been given by  Hugh Malhang  to the abbey of  Cumbermere  and soon after by different alliances became split into multitudes of other shares  WHEN entire it was under the government of the lord or his steward who were vested with the usual baronial powers This town had been governed by a bailiff but the election of that officer being dropt it is at present under the government of the constables It has likewise several other officers such as the  rulers of walling  who were guardians of the saltsprings and re∣gulated all matters respecting their important staple of the place  History of Nantwich      AFTER them came the  aletasters  whose office related to the assize of bread and drink  THE next were the  healthkeepers  who attended to the right of the beamheath antiently called the  creach  and took care to pre∣serve it from all incroachments or trespassers  THE  leavelookers  superintended the markets inspected the weights and destroyed unwholesome meat of every kind These corresponded a good deal with the  Aediles cereales  of the  Romans  as the next officers the  firelookers  did to the  triumviri nocturni  They had the care of the chimnies and were to guard against all accidents that might arise from fire  THE town is large but consists chiefly of old houses The  Weever  which divides it in unequal parts is here a small stream and not navigable higher than  Winsford Bridge  The inhabitants of  Nantwich  had many years ago an act for making this river navigable from that place to their town but they never carried the power into execution The  Chester  canal is now completed from that city and finishes in a handsome broad bason near the road between  Acton  and the town but at this time it remains  an almost useless ornament to the country nor has it as might have been expected given the lest increase to the salttrade for which this antient town was once so distinguished Unfortunately for it the other salttowns lie more conveniently for commerce and abound almost to excess with that useful article  THE chief trade of the place is in shoes which are sent to  London  Here is a small manufacture of gloves but those of bonelace and stockings once considerable are now lost In the reigns of Queen  Elizabeth  and  James  I the tanning business brought much wealth into the town  THE salt made from the adjacent brinesprings formed once a very important business In the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  here were two hundred and sixteen saltworks of six  leadswalling  each in only two works of five large pans of wrought iron The duty produced from them amounts annually to near five thousand pounds from the whole district including the works at  Lawton  and a small one at  Droitwich  from eighteen to twenty thousand pounds The tax on this useful article is very considerable which it bears as being of most cheap fabrick and most universal use It seems for that reason to have been one of the earliest taxes of the  Romans  for  Ancus Martius  near years before  Christ salinarum vectigal instituit  Aurelius Victor  c v  This tribute was continued on the  Britons  when the  Romans  possessed our isle  THE latter also made salt part of the pay of their soldiers which was called  salarium  and from which is derived our word  salary  THE art of making salt was known in very early times to the  Gauls  and  Germans  it is not therefore likely that the  Britons  who had in several places plenty of saltsprings should be ig∣norant of it The way of making it was very simple but very dirty for they did no more than fling the water on burning wood the water evaporated by the heat and left the salt adher∣ing to the ashes or charcoal  Plinii Hist Nat  lib xxxi c  Galliae Germaniaeque  ardentibus lignis aquam salsam infundunt    IT is very probable that the  Britons  used the spring of  Nant∣wich  for this purpose numbers of pieces of halfburnt wood being frequently dug up in this neighborhood  Salinis  was a place not far from hence one of the wiches but I am uncertain which The  Romans  made use of the springs and made salt by much the same process as we do at present The salt produced was white It struck the natives who stiled this place perhaps the first place where they saw salt of this kind  HeleddWen  or the white brinepits to distinguish them from the springs which they used in so slovenly a fashion  THE  Romans  were acquainted with rocksalt but had not dis∣covered it within the limits of  Italy  There were mountains of salt in  India Spain  afforded the transparent colorless rocksalt and  Cappadocia  the deep yellow  Piiny  libxxxi c  Strabe  lib xx But the rocksalt of our island remained undiscovered till past the middle of the last century  The  Romans  were conversant in the methods of producing this useful article from the brine  Fit et e putcis in salinas ingestis  Plin  xxxi  which they practised in our island and communicated their in∣structions to the natives Salt was an early import into  Britain  but it was only to the  Cassiterides  Strabo    and the neighboring parts which were remote from the saltsprings  THESE advantages are but sparingly scattered over  Great Bri∣tain Scotland  and  Ireland  are totally destitute of them In  Eng∣land  there are several but few that contain salt sufficient to be worked Thus there are some which rise out of the middle of the  Were  in the bishoprick of  Durham  others in  Yorkshire Cumberland Lancashire  and  Oxfordshire  See  Campbel's Politic Survey  i  all those are neglected either on account of their weakness or in some places by reason of the dearness of fuel These in  Cheshire  and those at  Droit∣wich  in  Worcestershire  with the small works at  Weston  in  Staf∣fordshire  are the only places where any business is done  Droit∣wich  and those in  Cheshire  were worked by the  Romans  and had the common name of  Salinae  FROM that period to the present they have been successively in use The  Saxons  according to their idea of liberty divided them between the king the great people and the freemen Thus at  Nantwich  was one brinepit which gave employ to numbers of  salinae  or works Eight of them were between the king and earl  Edwin  of which the king had two shares of the profits the earl one  Edwin  had likewise a work near his manor of  Aghton  out of which was made salt sufficient for the annual consumption of his houshold but if any was sold the king had a tax of two pence and the earl of one penny  IN this place were likewise numbers of works belonging to the people of the neighborhood which had this usage From  Ascensionday  to the feast of  St Martin  they might carry home  what salt they pleased but if they sold any on the spot or any∣where in the county they were to pay a tax to the king and the earl but after the feast of  St Martin  whosoever took the salt home whether his own or purchased from other works was to pay toll except the beforementioned work of the earl which enjoyed exemption according to antient usage  IT appears that the king and earl farmed out their eight works for they were obliged to give on the  Friday  of the weeks in which they were worked xvi boilings of which xv made one  sum  of salt This is a measure which according to  Spelman  amounts to a horseload oreight bushels The pans of other people from  Ascensionday  to that of  St Martin  were not subject to this farm on the  Friday  but from  St Martin's day  to  Ascension  they were liable to those customs in the same manner as those of the king and the earl  THE  Welsh  used to supply themselves from these pits before the union of our country with  England Henry  III in order to distress them during the wars he had with them took care to put a stop to the works and deprive them of this necessary article  ALL these saltworks were confined between the river and a certain ditch If any person was guilty of a crime within these limits he was at liberty of making atonement by a mulct of two shillings or xxx boilings of salt except in the case of mur∣der or theft for which he was to suffer death If crimes of that nature were committed without the precinct the common usage of the county was to be observed  IN the time of the  Confessor  this place yielded a rent of xx  pounds with all the pleas of the hundred but when earl  Hugh  received it it was a waste  THE  Germans  had an idea of a peculiar sanctity attendant on saltsprings that they were nearer to heaven than other places that the prayers of mortals were nowhere sooner heard and that by the peculiar favor of the gods the rivers and the woods were productive of salt not as in other places by the virtue of the sea but by the water being poured on a burning pile of wood  Taciti Annal  xiii c    WHETHER this notion might not have been delivered from the  Germans  to their  Saxon  progeny and whether they might not in aftertimes deliver their grateful thanks for these advantages I will not determine but certain it is that on  Ascensionday  the old inhabitants of  Nantwich  piously sang a hymn of thanksgiving for the  blessing of the brine  A very antient pit called the  Old Brine  was also held in great veneration and till within these few years was annually on that festival bedecked with boughs flowers and garlands and was encircled by a jovial band of young people celebrating the day with song and dance  Hist Nantwich      THIS festival was probably one of the  reliques  of  Saxon  pagan∣ism which  Mellitus  might permit his proselytes to retain ac∣cording to the political instructions he received from  Gregory  the Great  Bede  lib i c  on his mission least by too rigid an adherence to the purity of the Christian religion he should deter the  English  from accepting his doctrine In fact salt was from the earliest times in the highest esteem and admitted into religious ceremonies it  was considered as a mark of league and friendship  Neither shalt thou  says the  Jewish Legislator  Levit  ch ii v  suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meatoffering With all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt  Homer  gives to salt the epithet of  divine  Both  Greeks  and  Romans  mixed salt with their sacrificial cakes In their lustrations they made use of salt and water which gave rise in aftertimes to the superstition of holy water only the  Greeks  made use of an olive branch in∣stead of a brush to sprinkle it on the objects of purification  Next with pure sulphur purge the house and bring  "The purest water from the freshest spring  "This mix'd with salt and with green olive crown'd  "Will cleanse the late contaminated ground"  Theocritus Idyl    Stuckius  tells us that the  Muscovites  thought that a prince could not shew a guest a greater mark of affection than by sending to him salt from his own table  Pane ipso princeps suam erga aliquem gratiam  Sale  veto amorem ostendit  Antiq Conviviales    The dread of spilling of salt is a known superstition among us and the  Germans  being reckoned a presage of some future calamity and particularly that it fore∣boded domestic feuds to avert which it is customary to fling some salt over the shoulder into the fire in a manner truly classical  Horace  lib iii ode    Molibit et aversos penates  Farre pio saliente mica  IN this town was an antient hospital dedicated to  St Nicholas  endowed with a portion of tythes which were granted to  W Grys  by Queen  Elizabeth  Tanner    The historian of this place also men∣tions a priory dependent on  Cumbermere  and a  domus leprosorum  or  lazarhouse  called  St Laurence's Hospital  both which stood in the  Welsh Row  the street next to  Acton  but at present even their scite is hardly known Here was besides a chapel called  St Anne's  near to the bridge

Biron  who after the signal defeat he here experienced from the army commanded by Sir  Thomas Fairfax  Rushworth  II part iii  on the th of that month retired with his shattered forces to  Chester  The place was defended only by mudwalls and ditches formed in a hasty manner by the inhabitants and country people who were highly incensed at some cruel and impolitic treatment they had met with from the royalists The garrison defended themselves with great obstinacy The most remarkable attack was on the th of  January  when the besiegers were repulsed with great loss Among the slain on their side

the great family of the  Praers  Sir  Ro∣bert de Praer  gave it to his son  Richard  about the reign of King  John  upon condition of rendering to the heirs of his elder bro∣ther two barbed arrows yearly on the feast of St  Peter  and St  Paul  in lieu of all other services But the  Praers  remitted all their right in this manor and the patronage of the church to the bishop of  Litchfield  and  Coventry  in the fifth of  Edward  I and the bishops continued to be lords of the manor  till the second of Queen  Elizabeth  about which time it was alienated but the bishops still continue patrons of the church  THERE had been in much earlier times a family in this place which took their name from it for  Richard de Wibbunbury  was sheriff of  Cheshire  in Whether the  Praers  ever assumed that name is uncertain It is probable that the  Richard  above∣mentioned was the same with the sheriff and took the addition on receiving the place from his father  THIS village was formerly surrounded with gentlemen's seats Among those was  Lee  the residence of a family of the same name from which were descended the  Lees  earls of  Litchfield  derived from  Benedict  a son of this house who made

indi∣viduals and the public from this internal navigation But when it happens that the kingdom is engaged in a foreign war with what security is the trade between those three great ports carried on and with how much less expence has the trader his goods conveyed to any part of the kingdom than he had for∣merly been subject to when the goods were obliged to be car∣ried coastways and to pay insurance  I BELIEVE it may be asserted that no undertaking equally ex∣pensive and arduous was ever attempted by private people in any kingdom and in justice to the adventurers it must be allowed that considering the difficulties they met with owing to the na∣ture of the works or the caprice of persons whose lands were taken to make the canal that ten years and a half was but a short time to perform it in and that satisfaction has been made to every individual who suffered any injury by the execution of the undertaking The profits arising from tonnage is already very considerable and there is no doubt but they will increase annually and notwithstanding the enormous sum of money it has cost in the execution the proprietors will be amply repaid and have the comfort to reflect that by the conclusion of this project they have contributed to the good of their country and acquired wealth for themselves and posterity  IMMEDIATELY after leaving  Stonefield  STONE  reached the little town of  Stone  a place remarkable for religious antiquity  Legend  tells  us that the beforementioned  Wulferus  then a Pagan put to death his two sons  Wulfad  and  Rufin  on suspicion of favoring the Christian faith  Wulfad  at this place  Rufin  at  Burston  about three miles distant Over each stones were erected as usual in memory of the dead from whence the names of those places are derived  Wulfere  after this unnatural deed was struck with the utmost remorse and by the influence of his queen and St  Cedda  or  Chad  who lived in a neighboring hermitage was converted to the religion he had so lately persecuted and by way of expiat∣ing his guilt among other works of piety founded at  Stone  a college of canons regular  COLLEGE  about the year His queen  Er∣menilda  is said to have also founded a nunnery here On the in∣vasion of the  Danes  the religious were dispersed but on the abatement of the cruelty of those barbarians it is probable they returned or at left a new establishment was formed This is certain that religious were found here after the Conquest for there is an idle tale of two nuns and a priest being slain there by  Enysan  a  Norman  This  Enysan  of  Walton  was the true refounder Caution must be used in reading the his∣tories of these times which are filled with pious romance Little credit should also be given to the murder of the sons of  Wulfere  The  Saxon Chronicle  is silent about the deed That prince was a convert to Christianity and seems to have founded the house through the common motives of zeal  Enysan  on his reestablishment of this house filled it with canons from  Kenelworth  PRIORY  and made it a cell to that place The  Staffords  who were his superiors assumed the honor of this new foundation and a second  Robert de Stafford  about the year rendered it free from  Kenelworth  excepting the right of patron∣age  and a yearly pension The church of this priory was the place of interment of several of this great family and numbers of magnificent tombs with their figures in alabaster lay there till the dissolution when they were removed to the  Augustines  on  Stafford Green  I see on the roadside a fragment of a thick wall perhaps a remnant of the priory The church is quite new and is a very elegant building dedicated to St  Wulfad  one of the supposed martyrs At the time of the suppression a tablet giving the whole history of the house was hung up in the priory it is related in old  English  metre but is so tedious that I must refer the readers who desire to peruse it to the cited author  Dugdale Mon  ii  As soon as I left  Stone  ASTON  I saw on the right a large house called  Aston  originally the property of a branch of the  Heveninghams  of  Suffolk Walter  the last of the line left two daughters the se∣cond who only had children conveyed by marriage the estate to Sir  James Simeon  who rebuilt the hall He also built in the garden a  mausoleum  in which I think he is interred The place is at present the property of  Edward Weld  Esquire of  Lulworth  castle in  Dorsetshire  and descended to him of late years by virtue of a marriage of an ancestor with a daughter of this house in the reign of  Charles  II  THE road from this place  BURSTON  for several miles passes along a pretty vale watered by the  Trent  bounded by two hills and much enlivened by the course of the canal About the third mile from  Stone  I went by  Burston  a small hamlet noted for∣merly for a chapel erected over the spot where  Rufin  second son of  Wulfere  was supposed to have been martyred and on that account in old times greatly frequented by the devout  ABOUT a quarter of a mile from hence on the top of a hill  stands the church of  Sandon  SANDON  This manor in the twentieth of  William  the Conqueror was in the hands of the king who be∣stowed it on  Hugh Lupus  and he again gave it to  William de Malbanc  or  Nantwich  It passed from this family by the gift of  Adena  eldest daughter of  William  grandson to the former to  Warren de Verdon  and by his daughter  Alditha  to Sir  William Stafford  and by the marriage of  Margaret  daughter of one of his descendants in the twelfth of  Edward  III to  Thomas  of  Erdes∣wik  It continued in possession of that family till the reign of  James  I In his time it was sold to  George Digby  groom of the stole to that monarch by his halfbrother  Richard Erdeswik Charles  Lord  Gerard  of  Bromley  became master of it by mar∣riage with a daughter of Mr  Digby  whose granddaughter by matching with  William  Duke of  Hamilton  conveyed it to Lord  Archibald Hamilton  who in disposed of it to Lord  Har∣rowby  A lawsuit concerning this place gave rise to the fatal duel in  November  between  James  Duke of  Hamilton  and Lord  Mohun  in which both combatants lost their lives  THE antient mansion stood near the church within a moat but is now demolished and a beautiful house commanding a fine view was built by Lord  Archibald Hamilton  on an eminence im∣pending over the  Chester  road The steep slope is beautiful cloathed with plantations of recent date but extremely flou∣rishing  THE church is in the gift of Lord  Harrowby  Before the dis∣solution it belonged to the abbey of  Cumbermere  being bestowed on it by the founder  Hugh de Malbanc  THE monuments are curious The finest is in memory of the celebrated  Sampson Erdeswik  the learned antiquary of the county  a faithful guide of all that concerned the families till his death which happened in He might have spared himself the ex∣pence of a monument his work would have perpetuated his name He erected one in his lifetime and is represented recumbent a colossal figure in a jacket with short skirts and spurs on his legs Above in two niches are his two wives kneeling the one was  Elizabeth Dikeswel  the other  Maria Neale  widow to Sir  Everard Digby  and mother to the unfortunate victim to the gunpowder plot Besides inscriptions to these ladies is a pedigree of the house for which as well as several other epitaphs of the  Erdeswiks  the reader is referred to the Appendix I shall only mention that the tombs are of the altarform and have the figures of the per∣sons commemorated engraved on the stone  THE inscription on a plain marble tomb in memory of Mr  Digby  OF GRORGE DIGBY  once owner of the place is very worthy of preservation as it records a remarkable piece of history I shall give it here at length and add notes to the obscure parts  Si quis hic jaceat roges viator  Georgius Digbaeus  Armiger  Vir si quis

and in his book stiled  Ecclesiasticus  he attacked  James  I in a very indecent manner  dicterici soedatam  Obtrectatoris sanguine  The affront offered to our monarch induced Mr  Digby  and some other followers of the Earl of  Bristol  then ambassador to  Spain  to attack  Scioppius  in the streets of  Ma  rid  in  where they left him for dead As soon as he re∣covered he removed to  Padua  dreading another attack He lived afterwards in continual apprehensions and shut himself up in his room for the last fourteen years of his life He died in at enmity with all mankind  Retinxit  Nec

unica  FROM  Sandon  the hills recede to the north I directed my course to  Chartley  CHARTLEY  about four miles and a half distant and about three north from the great road This venerable pile is built round a court and great part of it curiously made of wood em∣battled at top and the sides carved In many places are the arms of the  Devereux  the devices of the  Ferrars  and  Garnishes  and in  Saxon  characters the initials of the founder W D  Walter Devereux  with the motto  Loial suis je  Over the door of the gateway is carved a head in profile with a crown above In the middle of the court stands a fountain and the whole building is surrounded with a moat The view within the court is faithfully shewn in  Plot  tab v  IN several of the windows are painted glass In the great bowwindow of the hall are the horseshoes the antient device of the  Ferrars  in others the arms of that family the  Devereux Garnishes  and  Shirlies  A bed is still preserved here the work of  Mary Stuart  who was for some time imprisoned in this house besides this at present there are no vestiges of its former gran∣deur  Within and without is a mortifying appearance of neglect and approaching decay  A fire in  July  completed its destruction    AT a small distance from the house on a knowl are the poor remains of the castle  CASTLE  consisting of the fragments of two round∣ers and a bit of a wall almost hid in wood This fortress was very soon permitted to fall in decay  Leland  speaks of it as a ruin in his days When the power of the nobility was broken by the policy of  Henry  VII numbers of the barons finding their castle no longer a protection to their insolence were glad to quit so in∣commodious a kind of habitation We often see as in the pre∣sent instance an antient mansion near the remains or on the scite of a more antient castle the times were so much bettered and monarchy had recovered so much rightful strength that the for∣mer became useless against their prince or their rival  reguli  who then began to acknowlege the power of law Yet still some spe∣cies of castellated mansion against popular commotions or the attacks of bands of robbers was requisite Conveniency and a sort of elegance was affected in their houses but a necessary suspicion still remained and safety provided for by the deep sur∣rounding moat by the gateway and the strong door  Chartley  castle was built by  Randle Blundeville  Earl of  Chester  in on his return from the  Holy Land  and to defray the expences of this as also of  Beeston  which he also founded a tax was levied on all his vassals By his death this part of his estate devolved on  William Ferrars  Earl of  Derby  in right of his wife  Agnes  third sister of  Randle  His son  Robert  entering into the factious views of the  barons  received a defeat at  Chesterfield  in His estates were con∣fiscated and the castle and manor bestowed by  Henry  III on  Ha∣mon  Le Strange  but notwithstanding this he possessed himself of it by force and the king was obliged to order his brother  Edmund  Earl of  Lancaster  to besiege the place which he took but not till after much loss on both sides  Edmund  and the nobility who assisted in the siege thought proper to obtain his majesty's par∣don for the lives lost on the occasion  Ferrars  himself received his pardon was divested of the earldom of  Derby  but was suf∣fered to retain this castle possibly being reduced so low as to be incapable of giving farther disturbance It continued in his line till the reign of  Henry  VI when in by the marriage of  Anne  or  Agnes  sole heiress to  William  Lord  Ferrars  to  Walter Devereux  sheriff of  Herefordshire  it passed into another great race of peers The lady was at that time only eleven years and eight months old but by the king's special favor in she had livery of her lands without further proof of her age This estate continued in his posterity the Lords  Ferrars  Viscounts  Hereford  and Earls of  Essex  till the year when it fell to Sir  Robert Shirley  by his marriage with  Dorothy  youngest sister to  Robert  Earl of  Essex  the noted parlementgeneral and is at present pos∣sessed by their descendant Earl  Ferrers  IN hopes of finding  STOW CHURCH  in the neighboring parishchurch of  Stow  the monumental honors usually attendant on great families I vi∣sited it at the small trouble of a mile's ride I was disappointed for I found only one of this great line deposited in the place This is very frequent with a race of heroes whose active spirits carry them into scenes remote from their natal soil or bring themselves to fates that prevent possession of their parental se∣pulchres  Walter Devereux  the first Lord  Ferrars  fell in the field of  Bosworth  fighting valiantly in behalf of  Richard  and was  buried among the undistinguished slain  Walter  his descendant first Earl of  Essex  died Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland September  d as supposed by poison and was interred at  Caermarthen  His son the favorite of  Elizabeth  fell a victim to his indiscretion and ambition perished by the ax and was flung among the at∣tainted herd His son for a series of victories in the cause of liberty received from his grateful party the magnificent honors of a public funeral in the capital which his arms had defended  I FOUND here only the tomb of  Walter  first Viscount  Hereford  grandson of the first Lord  Ferrers  and founder of the house of  Chartley  He served with honor in the  French  wars under  Henry  VIII and in the naval attack of  Conquet  in he was honored with the garter by his royal master and with the title of  Hereford  by his successor His death happened in He lies here under a fine monument erected in his lifetime his figure is represented in robes with the collar of the garter round his neck his head reposed on a plume of feathers wreathed round a helmet On one side of him is placed his first lady  Mary  daughter of  Thomas  Marquis of  Dorset  on the other his second  Margaret  daughter of  Robert Garnyche  Esquire of  Kyngeton  in  Suffolk  Around the side is represented I suppose as mourners six female and six male figures the last begirt with swords  NEAR this is another tomb of alabaster with the figures of two persons engrav  n on it but so cankered with age that neither inscription nor distinction of sex can be made out  ON the chancel floor a brass plate preserves the memory of  Thomas Newport  steward of the houshold to  Walter  first Earl of Essex and delivers his character in these terms  Qui charus charis fuerat qui firmus amicis  En  Thomas Newport  conditur hoc tumulo  Qui felix ortu suit et morta beatus  Quem  Deus  et coelum quem pia vota habent  FROM  Stow  I hastened to the  Chester  road  WYCH WESTON  which I reached at the hamlet of  Wych  in the parish of  Weston on the Trent  whose spire steeple appears at a small distance on the other side of the road This place is productive of salt and has been long noted for its brinepits the property of Earl  Ferrers  AFTER going about two miles farther  HEYWOOD  I passed through  Great Heywood  a village bestowed by  Roger de Melend  alias  Long Epee  a worthless prelate in the reign of  Henry  III on his valet  Roger de Aston  whose family made it their residence till the marriage of a descendant with the heiress of  Tixal  occasioned it to remove to the new acquisition In my memory the old seat was in pos∣session of the  Whitbies  It has since been reunited to the house of  Tixal  by purchase The barn belonging to the manorhouse of  Heywood  was of a most magnificent size but of late has been greatly reduced  THE horsebridge over the  Trent  ITS LONG BRIDGE  adjoining to  Heywood  was not less remarkable for I remember it to have consisted of twoandforty arches but the number at present is much lessened There is a tradition that it was built by the county in a compli∣ment to the last  Devereux  Earl of  Essex  who resided much at  Chartley  and being a keen sportsman was oftendeprived of his diversion for want of one I am not clear about the truth of this report There certainly had been a bridge here long before so that if there was any foundation for such a mark of respect it could only have been rebuilt after falling to decay  SHUGBOROUGH  FROM the middle is a view of very uncommon beauty  VALE OF SHUGBOROUGH  of a small vale varied with almost every thing that nature or art could give to render it delicious rich meadows watered by the  Trent  and  Sow  The first animated with milkwhite cattle emulating those of  Tinian  the last with numerous swans The boundary on one side is a cultivated slope on the other the lofty front of  Cannock Wood  clothed with heath or shaded with old oaks scattered over its glowing bloom by the free hand of nature  IT is more difficult to enumerate the works of art dispersed over this  Elysium  they epitomize those of so many places The old church of  Colwich  the mansion of the antient  English  baron at  Welsely Hall  the greatwindowed mode of building in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  in the house of  Ingestre  the modern seat in  Oakedge  and the lively improved front of  Shugborough  are embellishments proper to our own country Amidst these arise the genuine architecture of  China  in all its extravagance the dawning of the  Grecian  in the mixed gothic gateway at  Tixal  and the chaste buildings of  Athens  exemplified by Mr  Stuart  in the counterparts of the  Choragic  monument of  Lysicrates  Antiquities of Athens  ch iv tab  and the octagon tower of  Andronicus Cyrrhestes  The same ch iii tab  From the same hand arose by command of a grateful brother the arch of  Adrian  of  Athens  embellished with naval trophies in honor of Lord  Anson  a glory to the  British  fleet and who still survives in the gallant train of officers who remember and emulate his actions My much respected friend the late  Thomas Anson  Esquire preferred  the still paths of private life and was the best qualified for its enjoyment of any man I ever knew for with a most humane and the most sedate disposition he possessed a mind most uncommonly cultivated He was the example of true taste in this country and at the time that he made his own place a paradise made every neighbor partaker of its elegancies He was happy in his life and happy in his end I saw him about thirty hours before his death listening calmly to the melody of the harp preparing for the momentary transit from an earthly concert to an union with the angelic harmonies The unfinished improvements are carried on with great judgment by his worthy nephew and suc∣cessor  George Anson  Esquire  AMONG the great number of statues which embellish the place an  Adonis  and  Thalia  are the most capital There is also a very fine figure of  Trajan  in the attitude of haranguing his army The number of rude  Etruscan  figures in the garden shew the ex∣travagance of the earliest ages and the great antiquity of the art of sculpture in  Italy  long before the  Romans  became a people The beautiful monument in the lower end of the garden does honor to the present age It was the work of Mr  Schemecher  under the direction of the late Mr  Anson  The scene is laid in  Arcadia  Two lovers expressed in elegant pastoral figures ap∣pear attentive to an antient shepherd who reads to them an in∣scription on a tomb  Et in AZCABIA ego  The moral resulting from this seems to be that there are no situations of life so delicious but which death must at length snatch us from It was placed here by the amiable owner as a  TEMPLE of the WINDS at SHUGBOROUGH  memento of the certainty of that event Perhaps also as a secret memorial of some loss of a tender nature in his early days for he was wont often to hang over it in affectionate and firm medi∣tation The  Chinese  house a little farther on is a true pattern of the architecture of that nation taken in the country by the skil∣ful pencil of Sir  Percy Brett  not a mongrel invention of  British  carpenters  OPPOSITE to the backfront of the house on the banks of the  Sow  stand the small remains of the antient mansion which according to  Leland  originally belonged to  Suckborrow with a long heard  and who as some say gave it to the mitre of  Lichfield  It must have been in very early times for the manor of  Haywood  in which this is included belonged to the see in the twentieth of  William  the Conqueror and so continued till the reign of  Edward  VI who bestowed it on Lord  Paget  The house was till that time one of the palaces of the bishops The reliques at present serve to give the appearance of reality of ruin to some beautiful  Grecian  columns and other fragments of an∣tient architecture which were tacked to the front by the late Mr  Anson  Shugborough  was frequently the house I had the happiness of making my headquarters from whence I made many an excur∣sion to the neighboring places I beg the reader's pardon for in∣dulging myself with a recollection of what formerly gave me so much pleasure in the survey and for detaining him with the ac∣count of a short circuit rich in objects  I SHALL cross the  Sow  and begin with  Tixal  TIXAL  distinguished at present only by the magnificent gateway a motley pile of  Gothic  and  Grecian  architecture embellished in front with three series of  AT a very little distance from this heath lies  Ingestre  INGESTRE  or  Inges∣trent  a respectable old house seated on the easy slope of a hill and backed by a large wood filled with antient oaks of vast size this makes part of the pleasureground The walks are partly bounded by enormous hedges of foresttrees and partly wander into the antient wood beneath the shade of the venerable trees  THIS manor about the time of  Henry  II was the property of  Eudo de Mutton  in the reign of  Edward  III it was transferred to the family of the  Chetwynds  by the marriage of  Isabel  daugh∣ter of  Philip de Mutton  with Sir  John de Chetwynd  in which line it continues being at present owned by  John Chetwynd Talbot  Esquire grandson of  John  Lord  Chetwynd  THE house is built in the stile of the reign of  Elizabeth  with great windows in the center and a bow on each side the last are of stone the rest of the house brick In the great hall over the fireplace is a very good picture of  Walter Chetwynd  Esquire in a great wig and crossed by a rich sash This gentleman was dis∣tinguished by his vast knowlege in the antiquities of his country  CHURCH  and more so by his piety The present church of  Ingestre  was rebuilt by him and was consecrated in  August  A sermon was preached prayers read a child baptized a woman churched a couple married a corpse buried the sacraments administred and to crown all Mr  Chetwynd  made an offering on the altar of the tythes of  Hopton  worth fifty pounds a year to be added to the rectory for ever The church is very neat and is prettily stuccoed In it is a mural monument in memory of its great benefactor who died in  Hopton Heath  lies on the side of  Ingestre Park  HOPTON HEATH SKIRMISH  and is noted for  a skirmish between a party of the King's forces under the Earl  Northampton  and another of the parlement's commanded by  William Brereton  and Sir  John Gell  Victory notwithstanding  great inequality of numbers declared itself on the side of the  yalists but it was purchased at so dear a rate that as Lord  arendon  expresses a great victory had been an unequal recom∣  ence for the loss sustained in the General The earl fell in the  tion neglected by his troops busied in the pursuit and left en∣  oned by enemies He flew his first assailants and died valiantly  fusing the offered quarter  AFTER riding from  Ingestre  three miles through very bad roads  eached  Stafford  a good town  STAFFORD  containing about five thousand  habitants seated on a plain bounded by rising grounds at a  ry small distance The streets in general are well built the  arketplace large ornamented with a handsome townhall with  e windows in front it is built upon pillars and presents a  cade with six arches intercolumniated with Ionic pilasters  is is the countytown and here the assizes are appointed to  held by a statute of the first of  Elizabeth  THE county infirmary lies at a small distance from the town  INFIRMARY  a good plain building was finished in and is supported  an annual subscription of between eight and nine hundred  ear  Stafford  consists of but a single parish  CHURCHES  with two churches That  St  Mary  is a rectory in the gift of the king a large building  th an octagon tower and formerly with a lofty spire rising from Here is to be seen the tomb of Sir  Edward Aston  the builder  Tixal  who died in and  Joan  his wife Their figures are presented in alabaster under a large canopy  THE font is a singular piece of antiquity very clumsy but the sides and base most singularly carved into rude  Gothic  figures  THIS church had been collegiate and was given a little before the year by King  Stephen  to the bishop and chapter of  Lich∣field  and  Coventry  The patronage was granted in by  Henry  VI to  Humphrey  Duke of  Buckingham  It was of exempt jurisdiction and consisted in the twentysixth of  Henry  VIII of a  ean and thirteen prebendaries  Tanver    The dean's house stood at the vese end of the church and serves at present for the school  THE religious houses were the  Grey Friars  RELIGIOUS HOUSES  or  Franciscans  at the north end of the walls founded according to  Erdeswik  by Sir  James Stafford  of  Sandon  It was valued at £  s    d per annum  and granted in the thirtyfirst of  Henry  VIII to  James Leveson  THE FRIERS AUSTINS had a piece of ground given them on the green at the south end of the town by  Ralph  Lord  Stafford  Dagdale's Baron  i  in order to found a house about the year for his own soul's sake those of his wives  Katharine  and  Margaret  Sir  Humphrey Hastings  Knight and that of  Edward  III The tomb of his great line were removed to this church from  Stone  at the dissolution but soon suffered to perish It was granted in the  of Queen  Mary  to  Thomas Neve  and  Giles Isam  A PRIORY of black canons founded by  Richard Peche  bishop of  Lichfield  and  Covenery  about the year as others say by  Ge∣vard Stafford  on land which he held from the bishop whom  complimented with the title of founder  Tanner    The prelate had  a great affection for this house for on resigning his see he be∣came a canon of it and here ended his days  Sacra  i This house was dedicated to St  Thomas Becker  ten years after his death  It maintained only seven religious whose revenues were £ a year On the  tion it was granted to  Rowland Lee  bishop of  Lichfield  BESIDES these were two hospitals and the free chapel of Saint  Nu  as  in the castle  THE town was defended partly by the river  Sow  FORTIFICATIONS  which bounds one half of it the rest was guarded by a wall and by a ditch supplied by the river with water It had formerly four gates of these two are yet standing The place never was defencible at last ever stood a siege Sir  William Brereton  the parlement general took it by surprize in  May  with the loss only of a single man  THE origin of  Stafford  is very uncertain the first name of it is led to be  Betheney  ORIGIN OF STAFFORD  and that it had been the seat of an hermit called  Bertelin  in high fame for his sanctity The earliest au∣  hentic mention of the place is in the year when  Ethelfleda  Saxon C    Countess of  Mercia  and sister of  Edward  the Elder built a castle her  This lady had one child by her lord  Ethelred  when ba∣  ing the pangs of parturition with the joys of connubial rites  azon  like she determined to forbear for the future all commerce with him From thenceforth her delight was in arms in con∣quests and in securing her dominions Such was her prowess that laying aside all feminine titles she received that of  King  as if Countess and Queen were inadequate to her heroism  Tour in Wales  THE scite of this fortress is not precisely known Doctor  Plot  is of opinion that it lay within the entrenchments at  Billington  at some distance from  Stafford  and seems to found his conjecture from the lands wherein they are being still a remaining part of the demesne land of the barony of  Stafford  Hist Staff    Cambden  attributes a tower to  Edward  the Elder founded in the year after that which was built by his sister and places it on the north side of the river A mount still remains near the new bridge called by  Speed Castlehill  at present named  Bullyhill  on which it probably stood  THE poor remains of the castle  CASTLE  which was garrisoned in the civil wars stand on a little insulated hill a mile south from the town The keep was on an artificial mount the whole is sur∣rounded with a deep foss which on the south side has besides the additional strength of a high rampart This was founded by  William  the Conqueror and was soon after demolished It is supposed that during the time it stood the custody of it was committed to  Robert de Tonei  younger son of  Roger  standardbearer of  Normandy  Dugdale's Baron  i  a follower of the Conqueror who took from this circumstance the name of  Stafford  It is conjectured that the king at that time reserved this manor to himself and that it was not included in the vast grant made by him to  Robert  of eightyone manors in this county twentysix in that of  Warwick  twenty in  Lincolnshire  two in  Suffolk  and one in each of those of  Worcester  and  Northampton  It appears that it continued in the crown till the second of  Edward  II when  Edmund  Lord  Stafford  received the grant and held it  in capite  by barony together with that of  Bradeley  and  Madeley  by service of finding for forty days at his  own charge three armed men with three  equis coopertis  horses harnessed for war as often as there should be war with  Wales  or  Scotland  Blunt's Tenures    I do not affirm for certain the restorer of this castle Mr  Erdeswic  says it was  Ralph de Stafford  a distinguished war∣rior cotemporary with  Edward  III It was garrisoned by the king in the last civil wars was taken by the parlement forces and demolished in  ABOUT a quarter of a mile south of the castle in a low situa∣tion  MANORHOUSE  stood the manorhouse of the family fortified by the same  Ralph  for I find from  Dugdale  Baron  i  that he had permission in to make castles of his manorhouses at  Stafford  and  Madeley  This great family had in it barons earls and dukes and in the year became extinct at that time humiliated into barens again The moat of their antient residence is still to be seen surrounding a rectangular piece of ground the scite of the house  My curiosity led me about two miles further to  Billington  BILLINGTON BURY  to examine the supposed scite of the antient  Stafford  castle Near the extremity of a high hill steeply sloping on three sides and commanding a most extensive and beautiful view I found a large sea surrounded in some parts with one in others with two deep fosses This had been a  British  post as it agrees with those we find in many parts of the kingdom but as it retains the name of  Billington Bury  it probably might have been occupied by the  Saxons  whose posts are distinguished by the addition of  Borough Bury  and  Berry  THE town of  Stafford  is governed by a mayor recorder ten al∣dermen and twenty commoncouncilmen and was incorporated  in the third of  Edward  VI It first sent burgesses to parlement in the twentythird of  Edward  I They are elected by in∣habitants paying scot and lot and are returned by the mayor  Willis  iii    THE borough still retains one antient custom  BOROUGH  the privilege of  borough English  or the descent of lands within its liberty to the youngest sons of those who die intestate an usage which is sup∣posed to have been originally founded on the presumption that the younger child was the most incapable of providing for itself  THE barony was  BARONY  even at the Conquest one of the greatest in  England  and afterwards like other great seigniories stiled the  Honor of Stafford  None were such originally but which were royal but were afterwards bestowed in see on some nobleman as proved the case with this as mentioned in page when it was given to  Edmund  Lord  Stafford  with eightyone dependent manors with sixty knights sees  viz  nine in his demesne and fiftyone in service  AFTER leading the town I crossed the  Wolverhampton Naviga∣tion  Distances  Heywood  to its junction with the  Birminghaus  canal near  ∣verlampton  rise feet  Stainport on the Severn  c  feet  at  Redford Bridge  This may be called a port to  Stafford  A little further is  Weeping Cross  so stiled from its vicinity to the antient place of execution A little farther on opens the rich view of the vale of  Shugborough  varied with rivers and canals and bor∣dered with the several seats before described  CANK WOOD  ON approaching  Cank Wood  HEYWOOD PARK  I find on its confines  Heywood Park  a small house the property of Lord  Paget  remarkable for  the beautiful woody dingles that wind into the sides of the forest When I was wandering through them I imagined myself engaged in those of my native country Here I suppose to have been the park of red deer which  Leland  says the bishop of  Lichfield  had in his manor of  Shugborow  I skirted part of the wood which here ends boldly almost driving the traveller into the  Sow  This front has received from Mr  Anson  a wonderful change  Miraturque novas frondes  Pines instead of oaks which waving over the head of the passenger would recall to his memory had he been abroad the idea of many an alpine scene  RETURNING over  Heywood  bridge I passed through the two hamlets of that name and within two miles of the first reached the church and village of  Colwich  I must imagine the traveller  COLWICH  as well as myself blinded if we rode this space insensible of the most elegant view of the vale It is perfectly prodigal in its beau∣ties and spreads at once every charm that can captivate the eye It shews here at once all that I before mentioned  en detail  THE parsonage and church of  Colwich  contribute to the variety of the view from another station both are antient This place had been the property of a family of the same name  Erdeswic  at le  t from  Henry  III's reign to about the beginning of  Elizabeth  when it passed into that of  Leicester  of  Tabley  in  Cheshire  by the marriage of the daughter of  Edward Colwich  Leicester's Cheshire    to  Peter Leicester  Esquire  The church is dedicated to St  Michael  CHURCH  and is a prebend in  the cathedral of  Lichfield  Within is a tomb with the recum∣bent figure dressed in a gown of Sir  William Wolsely  Here is also the burialplace of the  Ansons  made a  l'antique  in form of a catacomb I must not forget an inscription in memory of an∣other Sir  William Wolsely  which does not commemorate his un∣lucky and singular end being drowned in his chariot on the th of  July  by the accidental breaking of a milldam in the village of  Longdon  by a thundershower His four horses perished The coachman was saved being carried by the tor∣rent into an orchard where he stuck till the water abated  BISHTON  AT a little distance from  Colwich  is  Bishton  WOLSLEY BRIDGE  near which I cross the navigation again and instantly after the  Trent  at  Wolsley Bridge  placed at the foot of the hangingwoods of  Wolsley  park an inclosure of much native wild beauty The antient mansion of the family of the same name lies low and near the river This manor is a member of  Heywood  In the twentieth year of the Conqueror  Nigellus  the paternal ancestor of  Greslei  held it of the bishop About the reign of  Henry  II it was a divided manor between  Richard Hints  and  Richard Wolsley  Bedeswic  Soon after this they seem to have become sole proprietors  AFTER riding a little way along the  Lichfield  road I turned to the left and crossing the vale which now expands and grows less  rionte  repass the  Trent  at  Colton  on a bridge of a fine single arch  THE BURBOT  Near this place is sometimes taken the  Burbot  Plot  tab xxii  Br Zool  N  o  a fish of disgust∣ing appearance but of a delicate flavor and very firm It is not common in these parts but abounds in the  Witham  and in the fens of  Lincolnshire  and is very common in the lake of  Geneva  where it is called  Lota  According to the new arrange∣ment of fish it is ranked among the  gadi  or  codfish  by Mr  Ray  among the eelshaped fish The form is long the head depressed the mouth large armed with small teeth the nose furnished with two beards the chin with one on the back are two fins the skin smooth and slippery of a disagreeable green color spotted with yellow It is very voracious and very pro∣lific The noted old fisherman of the  Rhine Leonard Baltner  took out of a single fish not fewer than eggs  MR  Erdeswik  informs us that at the time of the Conqueror one  Galfridus  was lord of  Colton  Soon after  COLTON  Sir  Hardulph de Gastenoys  had either all or shared it with another for in the year Sir  William Gastenoys  and  Anselm le Marshal  were joint lords of it After many generations a female  Thomasine  sole heiress and daughter of Sir  Thomas Gastenoys  last male heir of the fa∣mily by marriage with Sir  Nicholas Greislei  about trans∣ferred it to the house of  Drakelow  The old hall which was large enough to contain fourscore lodgingrooms was burnt down in the time of  Charles  I by the carelessness of a servant It at that time belonged to Lord  Aston  Mr  Allen  's MSS  THE country now alters for the worse and the soil becomes wet and miry About two miles distance from  Colton  stands  Blithefield  BLITHEFIELD  the respectable old seat of the respectable family of the  Bagots  a most antient and virtuous race At the time of the Conquest they were found possessed of  Bagot's Bromley  In or the fifth of  Richard  I a younger branch became ennobled by the marriage of  Millisent  heiress of  Robert  Lord  Stafford  Dugdale  i  with  Hervey Bagot  from which match sprung a long line of peers of every rank The elder branch acquired this place by the mar∣riage of Sir  Ralph Bagot  before the reign of  Henry  IV with  Elizabeth  sole heiress of  Richard Blithefield  lineally descended from a  Saxon  of the name of  Hereman  or the warrior  THE house is built round a court and still retains on the out∣side the simplicity of appearance of that of an antient baron and within the old hospitality The best rooms are the hall the library and a large drawingroom lately added The first is a noble apartment unadorned excepting over the chimneypiece where is a representation in bold and good sculpture in free∣stone of an event dear as life to every true  Englishman  that of King  John  granting to his subjects the great charter of liberty  AMONG the portraits I observed on a board in a flat manner

received and sent back with the promises of better usage Grief or as others say poison administered by the instigation of  Leicester  who loved his wife cut him off at the age of thirtyfive at  Dublin  in Perhaps the infamy of  Dudley  's character and the speedy and indecent marriage of the countess with that favorite might give rise to the scandal for an inquisition was made on his death and the report in consequence was that he died of the flux a disorder very frequent in  Ireland  in those days  HERE are several portraits of different persons  COLONEL RICHARD BAGOT  of this worthy house Among them is Colonel  Richard Bagot  governor of  Lichfield  who fell in the cause of loyalty in the fatal battle of  Naseby  He is dressed in a buff coat and represented with long hair  I MUST not omit a curiouspicture of a countrywoman of mine  MRS SALUSBURY  Mrs  Salusbury  of  Bachymbed  in  Denhighshire  in a vast high sugarloafed hat and kerchief bordered with ermine Near her are two of her grandchildren Sir  Edward Bagot  and  Elizabeth  after∣wards Countess of  Uxbridge  by her daughter  Jane  who married Sir  Walter Bagot  and conveyed the  Welch  estate into the family A head of her son  Charles Salusbury  in long hair and flowered nightgown is also preserved here  MARY Countess of  Ailsford  LADY AILSFORD  painted in her oldage by  Hudson  sitting is a most beautiful portrait She is dressed  simplex mun∣ditiis  in pale brown sattin white hood handkerchief apron and short ruffles a reproach to the unsuitable fantastic dress of these times which attempts to disguise respectful years and renders that inevitable period the object of ridicule  Mary  daughter to  Hervey Bagot  Esquire of  Pipehall  first mar∣ried to Sir  Charley Berkeley  Earl of  Falmouth  According to Lord  Clarendon  's account he was a very worthless young fa∣vorite of  Charles  II He was killed in the great seafight with the  Dutch  in  Charles  wept bitterly at his death The loss of better men never went so near his heart  Clarendon's Continuation    and afterwards to  Charles  Earl of  Dorset  a brown beauty of the gay court of  Charles  II and as  Grammont  says the only one that had

eccentric statesman  Henry  Earl of  Bolingbroke  when young dressed in his robes  A HEAD of that great actor and dramatic poet  Moliere  MOLIERE  He lived the adoration of his countrymen but dying in his pro∣fession was according to a custom of the church of his na∣tion refused Christian burial by  Harlai de Chanvalon  a de∣bauched archbishop of  Paris  The king  Lewis  XIV at length prevailed to have him buried in a church but the curate would not undertake the office The populace with difficulty could be persuaded to suffer his remains to be carried to their grave  Bouhours  marks the injustice done this great man in the follow∣ing lines  Tu reformas la ville la cour  Mais quella en fut la recompense  Les  François  rougiront un jour  De leur peu de reconnaissance  II leur falut an comedien  Qui mit à les polir sa gloire son etude  Mais  Moliere  a tu gloire il ne manquera rien  Si parmi les defauts que to peignis si bien  Tu les avais repris de leur ingratitude  I QUIT the subject of paintings notwithstanding there are mul∣titudes of pictures by the best masters in this house They were all undergoing a removal therefore I avoid further men∣tion of them until they are fixed in their permanent situations But I must not be silent about the collection of coins one of the most valuable and instructive in  England  the bequest of his be∣loved neighbor and friend  Thomas Anson  Esquire  THE park is at some distance from the house  PARK  The oaks are of a very great size a twintree was lately sold for £ and some single ones for half that sum and I am told that there are seve∣ral now standing equally large  THE church is very near the house  CHURCH  in the gift of Sir  William Bagot  dedicated to St  Leonard  Within are several sculptured tombs of the time of the fifteenth century some with imaged figures others engraven mostly in memorial of the  Bagots  one of an  Aston  of  Broughton  and another expressed by a little skele∣ton of a  Broughton  a child of three months old The monument of Sir  Edward Bagot  who died in is mural and supersedes the ten commandments being placed over the altar The in∣scription tells us that he was a true assertor of episcopacy in the church and hereditary monarchy in the state which probably  entitled him in those days to this sacred place On the outside of the church two modest heaps of turf parallel to each other mark the spot where the remains of the last amiable owners of the place repose whole merit survives in their successor  I FOUND myself here not very distant from  Whichenoure Hall  and could not resist the desire of visiting the seat of the celebrated  Flitch  the desperate reward of conjugal affection  IN my road not far from  Blithefield  I again met with the  Trent  HERMITAGE  and the  Canal  the last a most fortunate embellishment to the neat seat of Mr  Lister  of  Hermitage  The proprietors with the re∣spect they usually pay to gentlemen have before this house given it an elegant form and to add to the scenery luckily the awe∣ful mouth of a considerable subterraneous course of the naviga∣tion opens to view and affords the amazing sight of barges losing themselves in the cavern or suddenly emerging to day from the other side  THE church of  Hermitage  seated on a small eminence  CHURCH  forms another beautiful object This belongs to the cathedral of  Lich∣field  and is stiled the prebendary of  Hansacre  a hamlet in this parish founded by Bishop  Clinton  ON the opposite side of the  Trent  is  Maveston Ridware  a rec∣tory  MAVESTON RIDWARE  whose church is dedicated to St  Andrew  This had been the property of the  Mavestons  at left from the time of  Edward  I to that of  Henry  IV The tomb of Sir  Robert Maveston  or  Mau∣vesine  in the parishchurch recals to memory a melancholy story In the beginning of the reign of the usurping  Henry  when the kingdom was divided against itself two neighboring knights Sir  Robert Maveston  and Sir  William Handsacre  of  Handsacre  took arms in support of different parties the first to assert the cause of  Bo∣lingbroke  the last that of the deposed  Richard  They assembled their vassals and began their march to join the armies then about to join battle near  Shrewsbury  The two neighbors with their re∣spective followers unfortunately met not far from their seats Ac∣tuated by party rage a skirmish ensued Sir  William  was slain on the spot Sir  Robert  proceeded to the field and met his fate with the gallant  Percy  What a picture is this accident of the miseries of civil dissension What a tale is the following of the sudden vi∣cissitude of hatred to love between contending families  Mar∣garet  one of the daughters and coheiress of Sir  Robert Maveston  gave her hand to Sir  William  son of the knight slain by her father and with her person and fortune compensated the injury done by her house to that of  Handsacre  Erdeswik  THE other daughter  Elizabeth  married Sir  John Cawardine  whose posterity was extinct here in the male line by the death of  Thomas Cawardine  Esquire in  THE tomb of Sir  Robert  is altarshaped his figure armed and helmed with a great sword on one side and a dagger on the other is engraven on the incumbent alabaster slab with the fol∣lowing inscription  Hic jacet Dns  Robertus de Mauvesine  miles Dns de  Mauvesine Rid∣ware  qui occubuit juxta  Salopiam  stans cum rege dimi∣cans ex parte sua usque ad mortem cujus animae propitietur  Deus  HERE is a tomb of two other  Mauvesins  one crosslegged with each hand on his sword both under arches in the wall  NEAR the church is the gateway part of the antient mansion of the family of  Mauvesin  and on the other side of the  Trent  be∣yond  High Bridge  is a moated fragment of the rival house of  Handsacre  AT the distance of about two miles from  Maveston  KING'S BROMLEY  I passed by  King's Bromley  Before the Conquest this manor had been the re∣sidence of the Earl of  Mercia  Here in died the pious  Leosric  Dugdale's Baron  i  husband to the famous  Godiva  At that time it was called  Bromlegge  After the Conqueror took it into his own hands the name was changed to that of  King's Bromley  It con∣tinued in the crown till the year or the fortythird of  Henry  III when  Roger Corbet  died holding it of the king  in capite  Erdeswik  It continued in that family till the year or the thirtieth of  Henry  VI when it came by descent to  Praiers  of  Bad∣deleigh  in  Cheshire  from him to one  Partridge  who sold it to  Francis Agard  of  Ireland  whose descendants possessed it for some generations when it was sold to  John Newton  Esquire of  Bar∣badoes  in whose line it remains  FROM hence I passed by  Orgrave  one of the seats of  George Anson  ORGRAVE  Esquire lately the property of the  Turtons  Afterwards through the village of  Alrewas  The manor was in possession of  Algar  Earl of  Mercia  but on the forfeiture of his son the brave  Edwin  was bestowed by the Conqueror with the following on  Walter de Somervil  one of his  Norman  followers  FROM hence I visited  Whichenoure  or  Wichnor  WHICHENOURE MANOR  where I crossed a bridge of the same name over the  Trent  not far from the place where it receives the  Tame  The  Roman  road passes this way and on this marshy spot was formed upon piles of wood It runs from the east side of  Lichfield  and points to the northeast  Much brass money has been found and as I am informed there are vestiges of a  Roman  camp in  Whichenoure  park  THE church stands on an eminence  CHURCH  on the north side of the river The house is at a small distance and enjoys a most beau∣tiful view I believe this to have been on the site of a very an∣tient mansion which  Leland  observes to have been quite down in his days and that the seat was then below  SINGULAR TENURE  much subject to the n  ngs of the  Trent  The present house is a modern building remarkable for the painted wooden bacon flitch still hung up over the hall chimney in memory of the singular tenure by which Sir  Philip de Somervile  in the time of  Edward  III held the manors of  Whichenoure Sirescote Ridware Netherton  and  Cowlee  of the Earl of

the state matrimonial that it was in my power to con∣tinue the register of successful clamants from that preserved in the th  Spectator  but from the strictest enquiry the flitch has remained untouched from the first century of its institution to the present and we are credibly informed that the late and pre∣sent  worthy owners of the manor were deterred from entering into the holy state through the dread of not obtaining a single rasher from their own bacon  THE first pessessor of this manor was Sir  Walter de Somervile  a  Norman  on whom it was bestowed by the Conqueror It rested in his family till the death of the abovementioned Sir  Philip de So∣mervile  who left two daughters  Joan  wife of Sir  Rhys ap Griffith  Knight and  Maud  married to  Edmund Vernon  This estate fell to the former and remained in the family till the last century when it was sold by  Mary  daughter or widow to  Henry Griffith  to  Offley  Esquire ancestor to the late owner who within these few years alienated it to the present  John Levet  Es∣quire  I CANNOT tell the precise year in which it was sold to Mr  Offley  but it appears that  Henry Griffith  was living in  IN compliance with my original plan I took the same way in order to return into the great road Soon after  RUDGLEY  repassing the  Trent  at  Colton  bridge I reached  Rudgley  a small town cele∣brated for its great annual fairs for horses of the coach breed  THE church is a little north of the town  CHURCH  is dedicated to Saint  Augustin  and is a vicarage belonging to the chapter of  Lichfield  Opposite is a very antient timberhouse belonging once to the  Chetwynds  at present to Mr  Anson  On an eminence above the town is beautifully situated a large house formerly belonging to the  Westons  greatly enlarged and improved by the present owner  Ashton Curzon  Esquire  THE antient owners of  Rudgley  were of the same name with the town some of the family had the honor of being sheriffs of the  county in the reign of  Edward  III another was knight of the shire in the same period The name continued here till after the time of  Henry  VI  Erdeswik  mentions this to have been a ma∣nor belonging to the bishop of  Lichfield  which I find was alien∣ated to the king by bishop  Sampson  in  THE parish and village of  Longdon  succeeds that of  Rudgley  LONGDON  The church lies out of the road on the left is a vicarage dedi∣cated to St  James  and belongs to a prebendship of  Lichfield  The village consists of scattered houses extending for a vast way on each side of the lane from whence the name This gave rise to a common saying in these parts  The stoutest beggar that goes by the way  Cannot beg thro'  Long'  in a summer's day  THIS village antiently was full of gentlemen's seats a most use∣ful species of population to the poor whose distresses seldom fail reaching the ears of mediocrity but whose cries rarely attain the height of greatness Sir  Edward Littleton  had a house called  Chestal Simon Rudgley  sheriff of the county in the time of  Edward  III had another the younger brother of the  Astons  had a seat here from the reign of  Edward  I the  Broughtons  had  Broughton Hall  from the days of King  John  and  Adam Arblaster  possessed  Liswys  now  Longball  in or the twentyfifth of  Edward  III in whose name it continued till of late when it was purchased by  Francis Cob  Esquire  THIS manor is of vast extent Above thirty other manors lordships and villages owe suit and service besides  Cank Hey∣wood  and  Rudgley  to the courtleet which is held here every  three weeks It once belonged to the bishop of  Lichfield  but was alienated by Bishop  Sampson  AFTER winding up the steep of a high hill an advanced part of the forest of  Cank  I turned out of the road to  Beaudesert  BEAUDESERT  the princely seat of Lord  Paget  placed on the side of a lofty sloping eminence sheltered above and on each side by beautiful rising grounds and embosomed with trees commanding in front over the tops of far subjacent woods a most extensive and agreeable view so that it well vindicates the propriety of its name  THIS had been a place belonging to the bishops of  Lichfield  which with the manors of  Longdon Heywood Berkswick Cank Rudgley  and  Shugborrow  were part of the spoils of that see wrested from it in the time of  Edward  VI with the connivance of  Richard Sampson  then bishop who accepted in their stead certain impro∣priations of the value of an hundred and eightythree pounds a year These livings at that time were good rectories now poor vicarages or mercenary curacies annexed to the bishoprick  THE leviathan who swallowed these manors was Sir  William Paget  created by  Edward  VI Baron  Beaudesert  He first appeared in the reign of  Henry  VIII and from a low beginning merito∣riously rose to the dignity of secretary and ambassador to  Charles  V and  Francis  I In the next reign he was made chancellor of the dutchy of  Lancaster  and comptroller of the houshold and obtained a peerage In that of  Mary  became lord privyseal and was re∣stored to the order of the Garter from which he had been de∣graded in the time of her predecessor At the accession of  Eli∣zabeth  at his own request he was permitted to retire from the service of the state being zealously attached to the religion of his  former mistress  Fuller's Worthies    Yet his zeal for the old religion produced in him no scruples about sharing in the plunder of the church The reforming  Somerset  and the papal  Paget  agreed in that single point His posterity derive from him an uncommon extent of in∣terest and command  Beaudesert  was rebuilt by  Thomas  Lord  Paget  in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  It is a very handsome stone edifice in form of an half H of late most admirably improved and fitted up by the noble owner It is totally disengaged from the gateway walls and other obstructions that encumbered it in the days of  Plott  See his plate viii p  and the grounds that environ it are layed with the sim∣plicity that forms true grandeur  HERE is a gothic hall of eighty feet by twentyone a dining∣room of fortytwo by twentyseven and a magnificent gallery of ninetyseven by seventeen The other apartments are small  IN the drawingroom is a fine portrait of the founder of the family  PORTRAIT OF LORD PAGET  the first Lord  Paget  a threequarters length in a bon∣net black gown furred with a great forked beard the George a stick and dagger A fine performance of  Holbein's  FROM the house I ascended to the summit of the hill  CASTLEHILL  on the verge of  Cank  heath to an antient  British  post called the  Castle∣hill  It is encompassed with a vast rampart and two ditches The two entrances are opposite to each other and before the eastern are several advanced works It commands a vast view and was well situated for the purposes of a temporary retreat I refer the reader for an account of the uses of these entrench∣ments to my  Welsh Tour  Vol i  for they are common to most parts  of  Britain  Doctor  Plott  ascribes this work to King  Canute  but I suspect it to be of earlier origin  FROM hence is an extensive view of the chace  CANK FOREST  or forest of  Cank  or  Cannock  which  Plott  derives from the name of the  Danish  prince  Canuti Sylva  This vast tract was once covered with oaks but for some centuries past has been spoiled of its honors even old  Drayton  Polyolbion  song  deplores its losses owing as he says to the avarice of the times  O woeful  Cank  the while  As brave a woodnymph once as any of this isle  Great  Arden  's eldest child  Now by vile gain devour'd  BUT this change is much more beautifully described by Mr  Masters  in his  Itinerary  Published under the title of  Iter Boreale  of in which he describes his journey in most elegant  Latin  His passage over  Cank  wood and the translation by my ingenious friend  The Rev  Richard Williams  of  Vron Flintshire  cannot but be ac∣ceptable to every reader of taste  Hinc mihi mox ingens ericetum complet ocellos  Sylva olim passim nymphis habitata ferisque  Condensae quercus domibus res nata struendis  Ornandoque foco et validae spes unica classis  Nunc umbris immissa dies namque aequore vasto  Ante retro dextrâ laevâ quo lumina cunque  Verteris una humili consurgit vertice planta  Purpuresque erice tellurem vestit amictu  Dum floret suaves et naribus adflat odores  Haec ferimus saltem amissae solatia sylvae  A vast and naked plain confines the view  Where trees unnumber'd in past ages grew  The green retreat of woodnymphs once the boast  The pride the guardians of their native coast  Alas how chang'd each venerable oak  Long since has yielded to the woodman's stroke  Where'er the chearless prospect meets the eye  No shrub no plant except the Heath is nigh  The solitary Heath alone is there  And wafts its sweetness in the desert air  So sweet its scent so rich its purple hue  We half forget that here a forest grew  R W  FROM  Castlehill  I descended towards the great road and passed by  Fairwell  church  Called  Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae  DUGDALE  once conventual  FAIRWELL CHURCH  belonging to a priory of  Benedictine  nuns It originally was the property of canons regu∣lar or hermits but at the request of  Roger Jeffry  and  Robert  brothers of  Farewell  Dugdale Mon  i  and with the consent of the chapter of  Lichfield  was bestowed on the priory about by  Roger de Clinton  bishop of  Litchfield  who endowed it with the mill and all the lands between the brooks then called  Chistals  and  Blache Siche  with other emoluments mentioned in his two grants  Henry  II was also a great benefactor to these nuns bestowing on them three ploughlands at  Fagereswell  one at  Pipe  and one at  Hamerwich  and forty acres of land cleared from wood in the forest of  Cank  The same  in On the suppression of the lesser religious houses it was given to  Lichfield  to increase and main∣tain  the choristers in recompente of a pension which should have been given by Cardinal  Wolsey  out of his college at  Oxford  Leland Itix  iv  Rymer  xiv This place is called in different places  Fairweld Faurwell Fagrewell  and  Fagereswell  AFTER a short ride I reached the summit of a long but gentle descent from which is a fine view of the city of  Lichfield  lying at the foot of it The situation is delightful in a fertile and dry soil with small risings on almost every side The cathedral with its three spires is a most striking object  Lichfield  is a place of  Saxon  origin  LICHFIELD  and owes its rise to  Ceadda  or  Chad  the great saint of  Mercia  I omit the legend of the thousand Christians disciples of St  Amphibolus  that were mar∣tyred here under  Dioclesian  or the three kings slain at this place in battle as sculptured over thetownhall I take up its history about the year when  Oswy  king of the country established a bishoprick here and made  Dwina  or  Dinma  the first prelate To him succeeded  Cellach  and  Trumberct  and on his demise  ST CHAD  the fa∣mous  Ceadda  This pious man at first led an eremitical life in a cell at the place on which now stands the church of his name and supported himself by the milk of a white hind In this place he was discovered by  Rufine  the son of  Wolphere  who was pri∣vately instructed by him till the time of his martyrdom beforerecited Remorse and consequential conversion seized the Pagan prince As some species of expiation he preferred the apostle to the vacant see He built himself a small house near the church and with seven or eight of his brethren during the interval of preaching read and prayed in private On the approach of his death flights of angels sang hymns over his cell Miracles at  his tomb confirmed the holiness of his life A lunatic that by accident escaped from his keepers lay a night on it and in the morning was found restored to his senses The very earth taken out of it was an infallible remedy for all disorders incident to man or beast  Bede Hist  lib iv c  Ceadda  was of course canonized a shrine was erected in honor of him great was the concourse of devotees the place increased and flourished  THE history of our cathedrals is in its beginning but the his∣tory of superstition mixed with some truth and abundance of le∣gend humiliating proof of the weakness of the human mind yet all the fine arts of past times and all the magnificent works we now so justly admire are owing to a species of piety that every lover of the elegance of architecture must rejoice to have existed  WE are told that in the days of  Jaruman  about the year  CATHEDRAL WHEN FOUNDED  the cathedral was founded  I SHALL not trouble the reader with a dry list of prelates but only mention those distinguished by some remarkable event that befel the see during their days  IN those of  Winfrid  successor to St  Chad  in  Theodore  archbishop of  Canterbury  thought fit to divide the bishoprick into two and to establish the other at  Sidnacester  in  Lincoln∣shire  the present  Stow  Winfrid  disapproving this defalcation was deprived for contumacy The diocese might well bear di∣viding for at that time it contained the whole kingdom of  Mercia  At present it comprehends all  Staffordshire  except  which belong to  Worcester  the larger part of  and about half  Shropshire  IN the time of Bishop  Adulf Ossa  king of the  Mercians  pro∣cured liberty from the pope of erecting the fee into an arch∣bishop  ick in and to assign him for suffragans  Winchester Hereford L  g  ster Leicester Helmham  and  Dunwick  This honor died with  Adulf  A BISHOP  Peter  in the year succeeding the Conquest re∣moved the see to St  John  's in  Chester  where he died and was interred in  HIS successor  Robert de Limesey  smitten with the love of the gold and silver  Wharton's Augl Sacr  i  with which the pious Earl  Leofric  had covered the walls of his new convent at  Coventry  in removed the see to that city and at once scraped from a single beam that sup∣ported a shrine marks worth of silver  William of Malmsbury  as quoted by  Dugdale Hist Warwick  i    I NOW speak of a prelate of a different temper  C  I  TON  to whose muni∣ficence both the church and city were highly indebted  Roger de Clinton  consecrated in took down the antient  Mercian  cathedral We are not informed of the dimensions or nature of the building any more than we are of that built by this bishop It must have been according to the reigning mode of the times of the species of architecture usually called  Saxon  with massy pil∣lars and round arches There is not at present the left relique of this stile But I am unacquainted with the accident or calamity which destroyed the labors of this pious prelate who took up the cross and died at  Antioch  on a pilgrimage to the holy se∣pulchre  AFTER a succession of twelve prelates  Walter de Langton  BISHOP LANGTON  trea∣surer of  England  was consecrated bishop of this see in He was highly favored by  Edward  I His prosperity was interrupted by the resentment of the prince who meanly revenged on the bishop a short imprisonment he had suffered in the time of his father for riotously destroying his deer After a persecution and confinement of above two years he emerged from all his difficul∣ties and resumed his pastoral charge in a manner that did him great honor He may be considered as the third architect of this cathedral to him we are indebted for the present elegant pile He laid the foundation for our Lady's chapel an edifice of un∣common beauty finished after his death with money left for that purpose He built the cloysters and expended £ upon a shrine for St  Chad  He bestowed on the choir several rich vest∣ments a chalice and two cups of beaten gold to the value of £ To the vicars choral he gave a standing cup and an annual pension of £ and procured for them and the canons great immunities in particular there was an order from the king to the justices of  Staffordshire  that without trial they should hang upon the next gallows divers persons that by force kept their lands from them This prelate also surrounded the close with a wall and ditch made the great gate at the west end and the postern at the south He gave his own palace at the west end of the close to the vicars choral and built a new one for himself at the east end He partly built or enlarged the castle at  Eccleshal  and the manors of  Heywood  and  Shugborow  and the palace in the  Strand  He finished his useful life in  November  and was buried in the chapel of his own founding  THE cathedral continued in the state it was left by Bishop  Langton  till the time of the dissolution when the rich shrine of St  Chad  and other objects of similar devotion fell a prey to the rapacity of the prince The building continued in its pristine beauty till the unhappy wars of the last century  CATHEDRAL FORTIFIED  when it suffered greatly by three sieges The situation of the place on an emi∣nence surrounded by water and by deep ditches and fortified with walls and bastions rendered it unhappily a proper place for a garrison  IN it was possessed by the royalists of the county under the Earl of  Chesterfield  when it underwent the attack rendered memorable by the death of Lord  Brook  commander of the parle∣mentary forces His lordship in reconnoitring the cathedral in a wooden porch in  Dams street  was shot into the eye by a mus∣ketball on  March  d This happened to be the festival of St  Chad  the patron of the church The cavaliers attributed the direction of the fatal bullet to the influence of the Saint in resentment of the sacrileges this nobleman was committing on his cathedral What share the Saint had in this affair I will not pre∣tend to say but the musket was aimed and the trigger drawn by a neighboring gentleman posted in the leads known by the name of dumb  Dyot  The loss of Lord  Brook  gave very short respite to the garrison which was taken almost immediately after by Sir  John Gell  IN  April  in the same year it was attacked by Prince  Rupert  At that time it was commanded by Colonel  Rouswel  a steady governor over an enthusiastic garrison He defended the plac  with vast resolution A breach was made by the blowing up o  a mine The attack was made with great bravery but great loss  At length the garrison gave up on the most honorable con∣ditions  Clarendon  ii  The colonel took care to plunder the church of the communionplate during the time the fanatics were in possession They used every species of profanation hunted a cat in it with hounds to enjoy the fine echo from the roof and brought a calf dressed in linen to the font and sprinkled it with water in deri∣sion of baptism  Mr  Greene  's MSS    THE prince appointed Colonel  Hervey Bagot  During the time this gentleman commanded at  Lichfield  he received the following extraordinary challenge from a Captain  Hunt  a parlementary com∣mander in  Tamworth Mercurius Aulicus  p  Bagot  thou sonne of an  Egiption  hore meete mee half the way to morrow morning the half way betwixt  Tamworth  and  Litchfeald  if

narrowly missed taking him  the governor who kept possession till the ruin of the king's affairs in when the colonel and other commanders being satisfied that the king had not an hundred men in any one place in the field nor any garrison unbesieged surrendered on very honorable terms on the th of  July  to Adjutant  Louthian  Articles of Surrender    THE state of this church after so many sieges may easily be conceived The honor of restoring it to its former splendor  RESTORED BY BISHOP HACKET  was reserved for  John Hacket  presented to this see in On the very next day after his arrival he set his coachhorses with teams to remove the rubbish and in eight years time restored the ca∣thedral  to its present beautiful state at the expence of twenty thousand pounds  Br Biogr  iv A MS with which Mr  Greene  favored me makes the sum much less See  Appendix  one thousand of which was the gift of the dean and chapter the rest was done either at his own charge or by benefactions resulting from his own solicitations He died in A very handsome tomb was erected in the choir to his memory with his effigies laid recumbent on it with a mitre on his head and in his episcopal dress  THE west front is of great elegance adorned with the richest sculpture and till of late with rows of statues of prophets kings of  Judah  c and above all a very bad one of  Charles  II who had contributed to the repair of the church by a liberal gift of timber This statue was the work of a Sir  William Wilson  ori∣ginally a mason from  Sutton Coldfield  who after marrying a rich wife arrived at the dignity of knighthood  THE sculptures round the doors were very elegant but time or violence hath greatly impaired their beauty  James  II when Duke of  York  bestowed on this church the magnificent west window The fine painted glass was given of late years by Dean  Addenbrook  THE northern door is extremely rich in sculptured moldings  RICH NORTH DOOR  three of soliage and three of small figures in ovals In one of the lowest is represented a monk baptizing a person kneeling be∣fore him Probably the former is intended for St  Chad  the lat∣ter for  Wulferus  It is a misfortune that the ornaments of this cathedral are made of such friable stone that what fanaticism has spared the weather has impaired  IN the front are two fine spires and a third in the centre  FRONT  of a vast height and fine proportion  THE roof was till of late covered with lead but grew so greatly out of repair that the dean and chapter were obliged to substitute slates instead of metal on account of the narrow revenues left to maintain this venerable pile and after the strictest oeconomy they will be under the necessity of contributing from their own income in order to complete their plan The excellent order that all the cathedrals I have visited are in does great credit to their members who spare nothing from their own incomes to render them not only decent but elegant  THE body is lofty  BODY  supported by pillars formed of numbers of slender columns with neat foliated capitals Along the walls of the ailes are rows of false arches in the gothic stile with a seat beneath  THE upper rows of windows in the body are of an uncommon form being triangular including three circles in each  IN each transept are two places formerly chapels at present consistory courts and the vicar's vestryroom  THE choir merits attention  CHOIR  on account of the elegant sculp∣ture about the windows and the embattled gallery that runs be∣neath them On each side are six statues now much mutilated placed in beautiful gothic niches and richly painted The first on the left is St  Peter  the next is the Virgin the third is  Mary Magdalene  with one leg bare to denote her legendary wanton∣ness The other three are St  Philip  St  James  and St  Christo∣pher  with CHRIST on his shoulders  THE beauty of this choir is much impaired by the impropriety  of a rich altarpiece of  Grecian  architecture terminating this ele∣gant gothic building  BEHIND this is St  Mary  's chapel  ST MARY'S CHAPEL  with a stone skreen the most elegant which can be imagined embattled at top and adorned with several rows of gothic niches of most exquisite workman∣ship each formerly containing a small statue Beneath them are thirteen stalls with gothic work over each In this chapel are nine windows more narrow lofty and of more elegant work than any of the others three on each side and three at the end  In this chapel stood the shrine of St  Chad  SHRINE OF ST CHAD  Here was interred  Ceolred  Saxon Chr    king of the  Mercians  and in later times here was placed the magnificent tomb on the site of the shrine of the first Lord  Paget  adorned with columns  MONUMENTS  with two kneeling figures of a man and woman between the front and back pillars These were destroyed in the blind fury of civil war as was another fine tomb of a Lord  Basset  of  Drayton  who died in Few indeed escaped Of those are

There are twentyseven other prebends of which that of  Eccleshal  is an∣nexed to the bishoprick Out of these thirtyone the dean and four more are stiled canons residentiary which four are chosen out of the prebendaries and dignitaries Here are twelve minor canons five of whom are called priestvicars the other seven layvicars or singingmen Both these were formerly collegiated and had their hall and houses That of the priestvicars is a handsome room rebuilt and usually is lent for the purposes of assemblies and other amusements A new house also stands on the ground once occupied by the house of the choristers before it stood within memory a very pretty gate which formed the entrance on which was inscribed  Domus Choristes  BESIDES these members are an organist two vergers a sacrist and subsacrist It is remarkable that the four archdeacons have here no stalls as is usual in all other cathedrals  THE other churches are that of St  Mary  ST MARY'S  rebuilt since the year when the body being ruinous its fine spire steeple was unnecessarily pulled down In the time of  Edward  III a reli∣gious guild was instituted and after that much promoted by Dean  Heywood  Five priests belonged to

extensive churchyard This and that of  Stow  or St  Chad  's are curacies dependent on St  Mary  's St  Chad  's is reckoned the oldest of the churches of this city In its north end formerly stood the shrine of St  Catherine  whose chauntrypriest had his stipend from the vicarschoral of the ca∣thedral Near it is the well of the faint where he had his first oratory which in antient times was much frequented by de∣votees  THE grey friars had a house here  GREY FRIARS  founded about by Bishop  Alexander  who gave certain free burgages on which it was erected It was destroyed by fire in but rebuilt in the thirtysixth of  Henry  VIII It was granted to  Richard Crum∣blethorn  At present both house and land support an hospital at  Seal  in  Leicestershire  The water which now supplies the city was granted on St  James  's day in by  Henry Campanarius  son of  Michael de Lichfield  bellfounder  Henry  gave his foun∣tains  at  Foulwel  near  Alreschaw  in pure and perpetual alms to the friars of this house with power to cover them with a head of stones and of carrying the pipes through his land on condition that whenever they wanted repair the friars were to indemnify him and his heirs for the damage done to the ground Several parts of the house are yet standing and form a pleasant and com∣fortable habitation In digging near it was found a large tomb∣stone with a cross fleury surrounded by a singular inscription to the following purpose  Ricardus  mercator victus morte noverca  Qui cessat mercari pausat in hâc ierarca  Exculit ephebus paucis vivento diebus  Ecclesiam rebus

Michael  's merchant in the realms above"  The stone is still to be seen there A figure of it was sent to the  Gentleman's Magazine  by Mr  Greene  in this city The inscription and translation are copied from the same magazine for they ap∣pear to me to be equally faithful and ingenious  A LITTLE beyond stands the hospital of St  John  's  HOSPITAL OF ST JOHN  consisting of a master and twelve poor brethren The master is a clergy∣man who has a good house and stipend for superintending the  charity and reading daily prayers in the chapel belonging to it The founder is uncertain We only know that  William Smith  while bishop of  Lichfield  in the time of  Henry  VII formed here a new foundation for a master two priests and ten poor men  Henry  patronized the charity and endowed it with the old hospi∣tal of  Denhal  and the lands and impropriation of  Burton  church both in  Wiral  in  Cheshire Smith  also founded the grammarschool in this city  Leland Itin  iv    AMONG other things worthy of attention in this city is the ca∣binet of curiosities antient natural and artificial in the posses∣sion of Mr  Greene  surgeon It contains numbers of most valu∣able and instructive pieces in

large piece of water  CITY  originally three at present remain only this and another called  Stowpool  a little to the east Bishop  Langton  made the causeway bridges and dams at each end of the pool Before that the great road went round  Stowpool  near  Stow  church The city is neat and well built contains little more than three thousand souls is a place of great passage has a considerable manufacture of sailcloth and a small manufacture of saddlecloths and tammies  IT was originally governed by a guild and guildmaster  HOW GOVERNED  which were the origin of corporations and took rise before the time of the Conquest the name being  Saxon  signifying a fraternity which unites and flings its effects into a common stock and is derived  from  Gildan to pay  Spelman    Kennet's Gloss to Paroch Antiq  A guild was a public feast to commemo∣rate the time of the institution and the guildhall the place in which the fraternity assembled These at lest after the Conquest paid fines to the crown and formed part of its revenue  Richard  I enabled it to purchase lands to the value of ten pounds but it was not chartered till the reign of  Edward  VI who formed it into a regular corporation by its first charter This was confirmed by Queen  Mary  and  Elizabeth  and  Charles  II granted a new one confirming all the others  IT is governed by a recorder high steward sheriff two bailiffs a townclerk and coroner One of the bailiffs is elected by the bishop the others to be elected annually by and out of the bre∣thren which form the corporation The city has power of life and death within their jurisdiction a court of record and a piepowder  So called from  pier poudreux  or dusty feet because country people usually come with dusty shoes to fairs See Doctor  Pettingal  's able dissertation on the word  Archaeol  i  court which regulated the disputes arising in fairs  THE district of the city and county of  Lichfield  is called the sheriff's ride  DISTRICT  and lies at

said to have bestowed such great expence  Goodwin    The name only of  Castle Ditch  in the east part of the town preserves its memory Probably in this fortress  Richard  II kept his sump∣tuous  Christmas  in when he consumed two hundred tuns of wine and two thousand oxen  Stow's Chr    but with more certainty we know that it was his place of confinement in his road to the tower of  London  in a captive prince The unhappy  Richard  here attempted his escape by slipping from the window of the high tower into a garden but being seen was carried back to his imprisonment  The same    Wall  WALL OR ETOCETUM  the antient  Etocetum  lies about a mile and a half from  Lichfield  on the  Watlingstreet  road on a rising ground There are still some remains of the walls to be seen mixed with roots of some very old ashtrees Coins and tiles evince it to have been the  Roman Etocetum  as well as its distance from  Pennocrucium  a place somewhere on the river  Penk  not far from  Penkridge  but the site not well ascertained The  Watlingstreet  road enters the county near  Tamworth  and is continued into  Shropshire  as far as  Wroxeter  Near  Wall  another  Roman  road crosses it and at the intersection is an exploratory mount about forty feet in dia∣meter called  Offlo  in sight of  Borough Cop  near  Lichfield  on which  the martyrdom of the thousand Christians in the tenth persecu∣tion is said to have happened This is asserted by  John Ross  a  Warwickshire  antiquary who died in near twelve hundred years after the event which he alone relates  THESE  lows  which have the same signification as  laws  in  Scot∣land  LOWS  and mean a mount and placed here in sight of one another were usually designed as exploratory and for the repetition of signals and sometimes were sepulchral  I MADE one day an excursion in search of the seven  Tumuli  TUMULI  which are said in the first volume of the  Archaeologia  p to be near this town As I could discover only  Borough Cop  and  Offlo  which fall within the description I was obliged to extend my ride I passed through  Whittington  a village with a church and spiresteeple about two miles N E of  Lichfield  Passed through  Fisherwick  park a fine seat of the Earl of  Donnegal  built from a design of Mr  Brown  's the grounds bounded by the  Tame  a beautiful river  Elford  church village and house the seat of the late Earl of  Suffolk  form a pretty groupe of objects on the op∣posite bank I forded the river and went by  Elford Low  a verdant mount which Doctor  Plott  proved from examination to have been sepulchral but from its situation and elevation I suspect it might have had on it a  specula  or watchtower and that all the others might have been for the same use and to repeat sig∣nals in time of danger  See  Vegelius  Not ad lib iii    Elford  before the Conquest was possessed by Earl  Algar  ELFORD  after which the Conqueror himself seized it for his own use About  Henry  the Third's reign  William  of  Arderne  was lord of it and  his posterity was seised of it till the marriage of  Maud  sole heir∣ess of Sir  John Arderne  with  Thomas  second son of Sir  John Stanley  of  Latham  Knight he dying in the th of  Ed∣ward  IV  Margaret  his daughter conveyed it by marriage to the  Stantons  by the same means it passed from the  Stantons  to the  Smiths  from the  Smiths  to the  Huddlestons  and from the  Huddle∣stons  to the  Bowes  So very rapid was the change of family in this place It continued with the  Bowes  four or five genera∣tions but about the latter end of the last century became the property of the Honorable  Craven Howard  by marriage with  Mary  daughter of  George Bowes  Esquire and continued in his posterity the Earls of  Suffolk  till the death of the late able and honest peer when it devolved to his sister the Honorable  Frances Howard  IN the church are several fine monuments  CHURCH  in the antient stile  IN the north wall is a painted figure with curled hair

of his death on which was inscribed  Ubi dolor ibi digitus  ABOUT two miles further in a place called  Elford Park Farm  I discovered the site of the seven  Tumuli  or  Barrows  only one exists the rest having been destroyed within a few years that which remains is small and evidently sepulchral There had probably been a battle on this spot during the  heptarchy  whe∣ther between  Saxons  and  Danes  or two  Saxon  princes is un∣certain  Croxal  church stands on an eminence Within are two tombs  CROXAL CHURCH  with the figures of an armed man and his wife curiously engra∣ven on each One commemorates  John Horton  of  Caton  and his spouse  Anne  daughter of  John Curzon  of this place He died in the year His name is expressed in form of a  rebus  the word  Hor  cut upon a tun  THE other tomb is of  George Curzon  Esquire and his wife  Catharine  who died in By the marriage of their only daughter  Mary  to the famous Sir  Edward Sackville  Earl of  Dor∣set  it was conveyed to

two small towers  Tamworth  was totally ruined by the incursions of the  Danes  RUINED BY THE DANES  at length was restored by the celebrated  Ethelfleda  who  RESTORED BY ETHELFLEDA  in the spring of erected a tower  Saxon Chr    on the artificial mount on which the present castle stands Here in she finished her glorious life and in she received I may say posthumous honors by the assemblage of the  Mercian  tribes she had conquered who with the princes of  North Wales  here acknowleged the sovereign power of her brother  Edward  The same  probably obtained by her valour and prudence  THE town

Robert Marmion  one of the followers of the Conqueror on whom it was bestowed His posterity remained masters of it for some generations holding of the crown  in capite  by the service of finding three knights at their own costs for forty days in the wars of  Wales  ON the death of  Philip Marmion  in the twentieth of  Edward  I this fortress descended to his eldest daughter  Joan  wife of  William Mortein  who dying without issue it fell three years after by agreement among the coheirs to  Joan  FREVILES  a relation of  Philip Marmion  and wife of  Alexander Frevile  The  Freviles  by this means owned it till the year or seventh of  Henry  V when Sir  Baldwyn Frevile  dying childless  Thomas Ferrers  second son of  William  Lord  Ferrers  of  Groby  became master of it in right of  Elizabeth  his wife eldest of the three sisters of Sir  Baldwyn  FERRERS  The  Ferrers  held it till the beginning of the present  century when it passed into the family of the  Comptons  by the marriage of  James  Earl of  Northampton  with  Elizabeth  sister to  Robert  Lord  Tamworth  grandson and heir apparent to  Robert  Earl  Ferrers  who had obtained it by his marriage in with  Anne  daughter of Sir  Humphrey Ferrers  of this place Lady  Charlotte Compton  sole surviving daughter of the match Baroness  de Ferrers  in right of her mother married the present Lord  Townshend  whose son now Lord  De Ferrers  enjoys the place I must not forget to add that Sir  John Baldwyn  Knight on the coronation of  Richard  II claimed the honor of being the king's champion by virtue of tenure of this castle a service performed by his predecessors the  Marmions  but it being found that the  Marmions  held their right only from the tenure of  Scrivelsby  ma∣nor it was challenged by Sir  John

great round arches with  zigzag  moldings which were prior to the reign of  Henry  III when this species of arch fell into disuse Here are numbers of monuments some antient of the  Freviles  and  Ferrers  with their figures and those of their wives  Here is also a handsome monument of  John Ferrers  Esquire who died in aged and of his son Sir  Humphry Ferrers  knight who died in aged Their figures are repre∣sented in marble as big as life in a  Roman  dress long flowing hair and halfkneeling Sir  Humphry  was the last male heir of his line  THE church is dedicated to St  Editha  daughter to king  Edgar  who preferring the cloistered life to the troubles of a throne re∣ceived after death the honor of saintship It has been said that she founded here a nunnery and that  Robert Marmion  lord of this place received from her very sensible marks of resentment for daring to remove the holy sisters St  Editha  descended from heaven and while  Marmion  was lying down after a costly feast in  Tamworth  castle she admonished him to restore them to their rights and by way of memorandum gave him such a blow with her crosier on his side that he rose in extreme torments which instantly ceased on repentance and restitution  Dugdale Baron  i  It is probable that this very  Marmion  made the church collegiate and placed here a dean and six prebendaries each of whom had his substi∣tute or vicar for it is the opinion of  Leland  this foundation arose from the piety of one of the name  Itin  iv  The idle legend might have been formed from some real offence  As it is very doubtful whether there had been any nunnery here the offence might be the expulsion of the nuns from  Polesworth  convent dedicated to Saint  Editha  but were restored by  Robert Marmion  and his wife  Stevens    Tanner    which might have been expiated in the manner usual in old times  SAINT  Editha  had also an image here After the dissolution  the seven incumbents had pensions as late as  Willis  ii  Queen  Elizabeth  granted the college and all its prebends to  Edward Downing  and  Peter Ashton  At present this great church is only a curacy  In  HOSPITAL  the fifteenth of  Edward  I  Philip Marmion  dedicated here an hospital to St  James  intending to found a house of  Premonstrensians  but till he could execute his design granted it to  William  of  Comberyhall  with all its appurtenances and pas∣ture in  Ashfield  for four oxen and two horses on condition it should celebrate mass for his soul  Tanner    There is now an hospital founded for more useful purposes by Mr  Guy  FROM  Tamworth  I returned to  Lichfield  and resumed my jour∣ney along the  London  road  ABOUT two miles from the city  SWINFEN  see on the left  Swinfen  the seat of a gentleman of the same name happy in its beautiful de∣mesne ornamented with an extent of water meads and hangingwoods This place was once the property of the  Spermores  but in the time of  Henry  VI by marriage of  Joyce  daughter and heir∣ess of the family with  Willam Swinfen  it came into that name The executors of the last of that line a Doctor  Swinfen  sold it in the present century to Mr  Swinfen  of  London  in whose family it continues  A LITTLE farther the great  Watlingstreet  crosses the road near  Weford  or the ford on the way This is seated on  Blackbrook  a small stream now furnished with a bridge The stream runs through a beautiful tract of narrow but rich meadows prettily bounded by low and fertile risings This spot had been the scene of much civil rage A  Purefoy  was here slain by Sir  Henry Wil∣loughby  in the cause of  Edward  IV and Sir  Henry  in the same place fought and was desperately wounded by Lord  L'Isle  Leland Itin  iv Probably one of the neighboring  L'Isles  of  Moxhull  Weford Common  a black heath succeeds and a little beyond on the left stood  Canwell  priory founded about the year by  Geva  CANWELL  wi∣dow of  Jeffry Riddel  and daughter of  Hugh  Earl of

suppressed and granted by  Henry  VIII to Cardinal  Wolsey  towards the endowment of his two colleges  Tanner      NEAR this place I entered WARWICKSHIRE in the parish of  Middleton  from which the  Willoughbies  take their title The road is over part of the common of  Sutton Cofield  which is finely bounded on the left by a longcontinued range of woods  A FEW miles farther I passed  Moxhull  hall  MOXHULL  the neatdressed seat of Mr  Hacket  a descendant of the worthy bishop of that name whose son by marriage with  Mary  eldest daughter of  John L'Isle  became owner of it after it had been in the  L'Isles  or  de Insula  for some hundreds of years  Dugdale Warwicksh  ii  On the right is the parishchurch  Wishaw  and a little farther that of  Curdworth  CURDWORTH  That manor was possessed in the time of the Conqueror by  Turchil de Warwik  son of  Alwine  a potent  Saxon  in the time of  Edward  the Confessor  Turchil  is recorded to have been the first in  England  who in imitation of the  Normans  took a surname stiling himself  Turchil de Eardine  Dugdale Warwiksh  ii  or  Arden  from his residence in that part of the country then called  Arden  or the forest a word according to  Cambden  i  by which both  Britons  and  Gauls  expressed a wood∣land tract He was ancestor to the antient and respectable fa∣mily which flourished under the same name till the year when it was lost in the male line by the death of  Robert Arden  ABOUT half a mile from  Curdworth  I crossed the  Tame  at  Curd∣worth Bridge  and a mile further the  Cole  The view from hence of the stream watering a range of rich meadows bounded on one side by hangingwoods is extremely agreeable as is a little far∣ther the town of  Coleshill  COLESHILL  covering the steep ascent of a lofty brow on whose top appears the handsome church and elegant spire  THE place had been long a royal demesne was possessed by  Edward  the Confessor and afterwards by the Conqueror It fell either in his reign or that of  William Rufus  into the hands of the  Clintons  in whom it continued till the year the twentyseventh of  Edward  III when it passed to Sir  John de Mountfort  by virtue of his marriage with  Joan  daughter of Sir  John Clinton  Dugdale Warwicksh  ii  The  Mountforts  held it till the reign of  Henry  VII when by the cruel attainder and execution of Sir  Simon Mountfort  for send∣ing thirty pounds by his younger son  Henry  to  Perkin Warbeck  on supposition that  Perkin  was the real son of his former master  Edward  IV This brought ruin on himself and family He was  tried at  Guildhall  in and condemned to be drawn through the city and hanged and quartered at  Tyburn  Dugdale Warwicksh  ii  Digby Pedigree  viii  His manor of  Coleshill  was immediately bestowed on  Simon

inhabitants  purchased from the crown the lands charged with this money part maintains a school the rest is distributed to such children who repair to the church every morning at ten o'clock and say the Lord's prayer and the clerk has an allowance for seeing the performance and for the ringing the bell to summon them  Dungale Warwicksh  ii    THE figure of  Simon Digby  is in armor with lank hair

that the piety of the Catholics has given the same attitude to several of the  Sherborns  in the church of  Mitton  in  Yorkshire  who were interred in the last century so that I suspect it to have sometimes been considered merely as a reverential sign of our SAVIOUR'S suffering  THE deserted seat of the  Digbies  lies about a mile or two from the town  COLESHILL HALL  in a fine park The house consists but of one story besides garrets yet the apartments are numerous approachable by strange and unintelligible access to all that are unacquainted with them according to the stile of old buildings  FROM  Coleshill  I descended to pay a respectful pilgrimage to  Blithe Hall  the seat of the great antiquary Sir  William Dugdale  BLITHE HALL  from whose indefatigable labors his successors in the science draw such endless helps In respect to this county he has fairly baffled every effort towards the discovery of any thing that could escape his penetrating eye  THE house lies

 in the background  FROM hence I visited  Maxstoke  castle  MAXSTOKE CASTLE  three miles southeast most of the way through fields The castle is very entire and stands on a plain in a most sequestered spot surrounded with trees and guarded by a moat It is of a square form at each cor∣ner is an hexagonal tower and at the entrance a fine gateway with a tower of the same form with the rest on each side The gates are in their original state covered with plates of iron Above are the holes for pouring of hot sand or melted lead on assailants and the cavity which once held the portcullis These gates were made in the time of  Humphry Stafford  earl afterwards duke of  Buckingham  He fixed on them his arms still remain∣ing impaled with those of his wife  Anne Nevil  supported by two antelopes derived from his mother as one of the daughters of  Thomas Woodstock  Duke of  Gloucester  and added the burning nave or knot the cognizance of his own ancestors Within the court the walls are pierced with divers cells the antient casernes of the garrison  MUCH of the habitable part is still standing but part was burnt by accident what remains is the dwellinghouse of Mr  Dilkes  in whose family it has been for several generations The great vault ribbed with stone the old chapel and kitchen still remain and the noble old hall and a great diningroom with a most cu∣rious carved door and chimney are still in use  AFTER the Conquest  OWNERS  it was given to  Turchil de Warwick  from one of his posterity it was granted to the  Limesies  lords of  Long Icbinton  and  Solibull  from them to the  Odingfells  and from the  Odingfells  by  Ida  eldest daughter of the last of the name to the  great family of the  Clintons  before mentioned who made it their chief seat In the sixteenth of  Henry  VI Sir  William de Clinton  exchanged it with  Humphry  earl of  Buckingham  with whom it became a favorite residence On the execution of his son  Henry  Duke of  Buckingham  in the first of  Richard  III it was seized by the king  Richard  on his march towards  Notting∣ham  ordered all the inner buildings of  Kenelworth  castle to be re∣moved here  Dugdale  ii  After his defeat and death in  Bosworth  field this place reverted to  Edward  son of the last duke who fell a victim in to  Henry  VIII a tyrant greater and more inexcusable than him who destroyed the father The estates again forfeited were granted to Sir  William Compton  a favorite and gallant tilter in the reign of the former and ancestor of the Earl of  Northampton  In his great grandson  William  Lord  Compton  conveyed it to Lord Keeper  Egerton  who in two years after sold it to  Thomas Dilke  Esquire in whose family it remains  I DID not visit the neighboring priory of  Maxstoke  so shall say no more of it than that it was founded in by Sir  William de Clinton  afterwards Earl of  Huntingdon  and peopled with canons regular of St  Augustin  Tanner    RETURNED through  Coleshill  and at a small distance on the left of the road digressed to  Packington  the seat of the Earl of  Ails∣ford  PACKINGTON  The manor antiently belonged to the priory of  Kenelworth  being granted to it by  Geoffry de Clinton  lord chamberlain to  Herny  II At the dissolution it was sold for the sum of six hun∣dred and twentyone pounds and one penny to  John Fisher  Esquire gentlemanpensioner to  Henry  VIII and four succeeding  monarchs By the marriage of  Mary  daughter and heiress of Sir  Clement Fisher  Baronet with  Heneage  second Earl of  Ailsford  the place was transferred to that noble family The situation has of late years been highly improved by the change of the road The grounds are prettily sloped by nature are well wooded and the bottom filled with two pleasing pieces of water The house has also undergone many alterations is a plain convenient building except on one side where opens a  loggio  in our climate most admi∣rably adapted for the encouragement of rheums and rheumatisms  WITHIN is a good portrait of its founder  John Fisher  a half∣length with a square white beard close black cap upright ruff and black jacket  A BEAUTIFUL picture of  Henrietta Maria  consort to  Charles  I She is represented sitting in blue with roses in her hand and her thorny crown by her  HERE is also a portrait of  Charles  Duke of  Somerset  in his robes father to the Countess Dowager of  Ailsford  THE country here begins to lose the comforts of a gravelly soil and changes to the wetretaining clay At the pleasant village of  Mireden  it is uncommonly deep  MIREDEN  but by the assistance of turn∣pikes become an excellent road The pretty houses on each side of the way and the magnificent inn famed for time immemorial for its excellent maltliquor with the various embellishments made by the old innkeeper  Reynolds  of gateway little ponds statues and other whims enliven the spot greatly  THE church is seated a little higher up  CHURCH  on an eminence Within is a handsome alabaster tomb of  John Wyard  in armour and mail with sword and dagger by his side his arms a cinquefoil on his breast This gentleman had been 'squire as the inscription re∣lates  to  Thomas de Beauchamp  Earl of  Warwick  and founder of a chauntry in this church near which he had his residence He was also knight of the shire for this county in the second year of  Richard  II  HERE is another tomb with a figure in stone supposed to have been that of one of the  Walshes  the antient lords of this manor His figure as well as the former is recumbent with their hands in the action of supplication but this gentleman has a short skirt over the lower part of his armour  THE antient name of this place was  Alspath  or  Ailespede  even till the beginning of the reign of  Henry  VI about which time becoming a great thoroughfare it got the name of  Myreden den  signifying a bottom and  myre  dirt and I can well vouch for the propriety of the appellation before the institution of turn∣pikes  IN  March  I changed my  Welsh  school for one nearer to the capital  OLD FASHION OF TRAVELLING  and travelled in the  Chester  stage then no despi∣cable vehicle for country gentlemen The first day with much labor we got from  Chester  to  Whichurch  twenty miles the second day to the  Welsh Harp  the third to  Coventry  the fourth to  Nor∣thampton  the fifth to  Dunstable  and as a wonderous effort on the last to  London  before the commencement of night The strain and labor of six good horses sometimes eight drew us through the sloughs of  Mireden  and many other places We were con∣stantly out two hours before day and as late at night and in the depth of winter proportionably later  Families which travelled in their own carriages contracted with  Benson  and Co and were dragged up in the same number of days by three sets of able horses  THE single gentlemen then a hardy race equipped in jack∣boots and trowsers up to their middle rode post through thick and thin and guarded against the mire defied the frequent stumble and fall arose and pursued their journey with alacrity while in these days their enervated posterity sleep away their rapid journies in easy chaises fitted for the conveyance of the soft inhabitants of  Sybaris  I CONTINUED my way to  Coventry  through  Allesey  ALLESEY  a village with a church and spiresteeple The place was originally a member of that city Bishop  Clinton  having permitted a chapel to be built here for the use of the poor reserving the right of burial to the mother church  Dugdale  i  In a place called  The Parks  stood a castle doubly moated probably the residence of the  Hastings  who possessed this place in the time of  Edward  I The present hand∣some seat is owned by  Neale  Esquire  AFTER a ride of two miles from hence  COVENTRY  I entered  Coventry  a great and antient city The time of its foundation is unknown By the addition of  tre  a town it should seem as if it had been inhabited by the  Britons  before the  Saxons  added the word  coven  to it as is conjectured from a nunnery very antiently established here The site of the old town is supposed to have been on the north side of the present not only because great foundations are discovered about the spot called St  Nicholas Churchyard  but I may add from the  tumulus  near it on the  Atherston  road called  Barrs Hill  on which might have been a castelet  THE certainty of there having been a convent here in the early times  SAXON NUNNERY  depends on the authority of  John Rous  Leland  iv says it was founded by king  Canute  who says that  when the traitor  Edric  ravaged this country in he burnt the nunnery in this city of which a holy virgin St  Osburg  had been abbess  ON its ruins  Leofric  fifth earl of  Mercia  and his countess  Godeva  founded a monastery At that period  Coventry  must have been a considerable place and its number of inhabitants great otherwise the fair  Godeva  could never have made so great a merit of riding naked through the town  STORY OF GODEVA  to redeem it from the intole∣rable taxes and grievances it at that time labored under The cause must have been equal to the deed Her husband long resisted her importunity in its behalf on account of the profits that accrued to him at length thought to silence her by the strange propo∣sal she accepted it and being happy in fine flowing locks rode decently covered to her very feet with her lovely tresses The history was preserved in a picture about the time of  Richard  II in which were portrayed the earl and countess He holds a charter of freedom in his hand and thus addresses his lady  I  Luriche Leofric  for love of thee  Doe make  Coventre  tollfree  Legend says that previous to her ride all the inhabitants were ordered on pain of death to shut themselves up during the time but that the curiosity of a certain taylor overcoming fear took a single peep which is commemorated even at present by a figure looking out of a wall in the great street To this day the love of  Godeva  to the city is annually remembered by a proces∣sion and a valiant  fair  still rides not literally like the good countess but in silk closely fitted to her limbs and of color emulating their complexion  AFTER the Conquest  NORMAN OWNERS  the lordship of this city fell by the mar∣riage of  Lucia  daughter to  Algar  successor and son of  Edwin  and grandson of  Leofric  with her third husband  Randle Meschine  to the earls of  Chester  Leicester    Cambden  i    Randle  bestowed on it the same privileges that  Linsda  enjoyed and bestowed great part of the city on the monks When  Henry  III took the earldom of  Chester  into his hands the remainder of  Coventry  fell to  William de Albany  earl of  Arundel  in right of his wife  Mabil  daughter of  Hugh Cevelio    On the death of  Hugh  earl of  Arundel  in it fell to  Roger de Montalto  who had married  Cecilia  his youngest sister After that it was granted by his grandson  Robert  in default of issue to  Isabel  queen mother of  Edward  III with remainder to  John  of  Eltham  afterwards earl of  Cornwall  and then to  Edward  king of  England  It thus became annexed to the earldom of  Cornwall  INCORPORATED  and became more immediately the object of royal favor  Ed∣ward  III in the eighteenth of his reign by letters dated the th of  January  made it a corporation consisting of a mayor and two bailiffs whom the inhabitants were to chuse out of themselves The first mayor was  John Ward  who was chosen in the year  Henry  VI in bestowed on this city a very particular mark of his affection by erecting it with a considerable district around  MADE A COUNTY  into a county  Accurately laid down in Mr  Beighton  's map of  Warwickshire  by the name of the city and county of  Coventry  and ordered that the bailiffs from that time should be sheriffs so that at present it is governed by a mayor recorder two sheriffs ten aldermen thirtyone superior and twentyfive inferior commoncouncilmen  Henry  came expressly to  Coventry  heard mass in St  Michael  's church presented the church with a gown of cloth of gold and then created the first sheriffs  THE representatives are chosen by the citizens paying scot and lot and are returned by the sheriffs The city sent members the four first parlements of  Edward  I That privilege was interrupt∣ed except the eighth of  Edward  II and twentieth and twentyfifth of  Edward  III till the thirtyfirst of  Henry  VI when it was resumed  AMONG all its privileges unfortunately for the magistrates it has that of life and death  Two parlements have been held in this city  PARLEMENTS HELD HERE  in the great cham∣ber of the priory The first in by  Henry  IV which was stiled  Parliamentum indoctorum  not that it consisted of a greater number of blockheads than parlements ordinarily do but from its inveteracy against the clergy whose revenues it was determined not to spare whence it was also called the  Laymen's Parle∣ment  THE other was held in the chapterhouse of the priory in by  Henry  VI and was called  Parliamentum diabolicum  by reason of the multitude of attainders passed against  Richard  Duke of  York  and his adherents  THE trade of this city was originally the manufacture of cloth  TRADE CLOTH  and caps or bonnets  Anderson's Dict  i  which arose to a great degree of conse∣quence as early as and continued till the last century when it was changed for the worsted business and for a long time the making and sale of shags camblets lastings tammies  c  c  proved a very extensive and profitable trade but this gra∣dually migrated into  Leicestershire  and  Northamptonshire  and at present only a few articles such as camblets and lastings con∣stitute the woollen trade  I MUST remark that in the beginning or middle  BLUE THREAD  of the six∣teenth century  Coventry  had a vast manufacture of blue thread which was lost before the year  Anderson's Dict  i  So famous was it for its dye that  true as Coventry blue  became proverbial  ABOUT eighty years ago  RIBANDS  the silk manufacture of ribands was introduced here and for the first thirty years remained in the hands of a few people who acquired vast fortunes since which it has extended to a great degree and is supposed to employ at left ten thousand people and has likewise spread into the neighboring towns such as  Nuneaton  and other places Such real good results from our little vanities  THERE are about a dozen traders in  Coventry  who have houses in  London  to which they send up weekly great quantities of ri∣bands and before our unhappy breach with  America  a very ex∣tensive trade was carried on with the colonies but the homeconsumption has been always reckoned most material A few ribands are exported to  Spain Portugal  and  Russia  but the  French  undersell us at those markets  WITHIN these few years four or five houses have begun to in∣troduce the making of gauzes and for that purpose chiefly em∣ploy hands from  Scotland  This branch is at present in its in∣fancy Another of broad silks was likewise set up which I am sorry to find does not go on with the expected success  THE military transactions of this city are very few It was an open town for many centuries and of course incapable of sus∣taining a siege The walls were not begun till the year  WALLS  and then by virtue of a licence granted by  Edward  III twentyseven years before nor were they finished in less than forty They were built by money raised by taxes and by customs on the wine malt oxen hogs calves and sheep consumed in  Co∣ventry  These walls were of great strength and grandeur fur∣nished with thirtytwo towers and twelve gates These continued till the d of  July  when great part of the wall and most of the towers and many of the gates were pulled down with certain circumstances of disgrace as a punishment for the disloy∣alty of the inhabitants in shutting their gates against their mo∣narch  Charles  I on the th of  August  His majesty after setting up his standard at  Nottingham  had sent to this city to acquaint them that he meant to reside there for some time and desired quarters for his forces in and about the place The mayor and aldermen with many expressions of affection offered to receive the king but refused admittance to any of the soldiery Incensed at this his majesty attacked the city  CITY ATTACKED BY CHARLES I  and with his ord∣nance forced open one of the gates but was repulsed by the valour of the citizens and obliged to retire with loss  Vicar's Parliament Chron    In the following month  Coventry  was regularly garrisoned by the parle∣ment  Whitelock    and remained in its possession during the whole war  I SHOULD have mentioned before that in the fifteenth century another monarch had been denied the possession of this city The great Earl of  Warwick  armed it against  Edward  IV in  when he attempted entering on the side of  Gosford Green  The king amply repaid the insult on the citizens who perhaps acted by constraint He deprived them of their privileges and made them pay five hundred marks for the recovering of them by having the sword restored to them  BEFORE the building of the walls  CASTLE  there had been from very early times a castle on the south side of the town near  Chyles∣more  with a park belonging to it This had been the residence of the kings and earls of  Mercia  it afterwards fell to the earls of  Chester  and at length was vested in the royal line No vestige of it is now to be seen in its place is a very antient wooden building the remains of the manorhouse of  Chylesmore  probably built after the demolition of the castle  KING  Stephen  forcibly took this fortress from  Randle de Gernons  earl of  Chester  The earl in attempted to reduce it not by siege but by erecting a fort near it in order to distress the gar∣rison by cutting off supplies The king twice attempted its re∣lief the first time without success but in the second action he defeated the earl forced him to fly covered with wounds  DEMOLISHED  and then demolished the castle  Leicester's Cheshire ex gestis Stephani      I SHALL take notice of the ecclesiastical history churches re∣mains of religious houses and the public buildings in the course of my walk about the city in which I was accompanied by the Reverend Doctor  Edwards  whose hospitality and politeness I have more than once had occasion to experience  Coventry  is seated on ground gently sloping on most sides  CITY DESCRIBED  its length from  Hillstreetgate  to  Gosfordgate  is about three quarters  of a mile exclusive of the suburbs The streets in general are narrow and composed of very antient buildings the stories of which in some impend one over the other in such a manner as nearly to meet at top and exclude the sight of the sky By the appearance of the whole it is very evident that it never under∣  ent the calamity of fire which deprecated as it ought to be is usually the cause of future improvement  THE number of inhabitants taken at different periods  NUMBERS  in the last two hundred years is very different Before they were found to have been but on that violent convulsion the Dissolution trade grew so low and occasioned such a dispersion of people from this city as to reduce them to To re∣medy this evil  Edward  VI granted the city a charter for an ad∣ditional fair To this cause perhaps was owing the increase by the year to In when the inhabitants were  umbered from the apprehension of a siege they were found to amount to  Dagdale  i  By  Bradford  's  Published by  in  Survey of Coventry  made in and there appears to have been houses and people The accounts at present vary from to  but from my enquiries the middle sum between both may come nearest the truth  THE city is watered by the  Radford  and the  Sherborn  brooks which from N and S meet within the walls and after a short  bound the northeastern parts without the walls  WE began our progress from the  Chester  road  SPONNE HOSPI∣TAL FOR LEPERS  on the western side of the city at the reliques of  Sponne  hospital consisting of the chapel and gateway It was founded for the lepers which  happened to be in  Coventry  by  Hugh Ceveilioc  earl of  Chester  out of affection to  William de Auney  a knight of his houshold afflicted with the leprosy Here was also a priest to pray both for the living and the dead also certain brethren and sisters to pray with the lepers for the good estate of all their benefactors This hospital is said once to have belonged to the abbey of  Basing∣werk  in  Flintshire  but at length was appropriated to the monk  of  Coventry  from whom it passed to the crown in the time of  Edward  IV who gave it to the canons of  Studley  in order to obtain their prayers for him and all his connections  THAT loathsome disorder which gave rise to this  APPEARANCE IN ENGLAND  and number  of other similar foundations was introduced into  England  in the reign of  Henry  I and was supposed to have been brought out of  Egypt  or perhaps the east by means of the crusades To add to the horror it was contagious which enhanced the charity of a provision for such miserables who were not only naturally shunned but even chaced by royal edict from the society of their fellowcreatures  Edward  III drove from  London  all the lepers except fourteen who  dmittance into St  Giles  's hospital  All the lesser  Lazar  houses in  England  were subject to the rich house at  Burton  in  Leicestershire  which again was subject to that in  Jerusalem  anner    They were usually de∣dicated to St  Lazarus  from whom they derived their name  A LITTLE farther is the entrance into the city  SPONNE GATE  in my me  under a venerable and magnificent gate called  Sponne Gate  late years demolished in order to give admittance to the e  ∣mous  SPONNE GATE  waggons loaden beyond the height of arches erected when war was our chief trade  IMMEDIATELY within the walls on the left stands the church of St  John  CHURCH OF ST JOHN  a very handsome building with a neat but not lofty tower placed in the centre the inside is in form of a cross in∣tersected by a short transept the windows high and form a long range with very narrow divisions This church was originally a chapel to the merchants gild the most antient in  Coventry  licensed by  Edward  III in for a fraternity of brethren and sisters with a warden or master to be elected out of the body who might make chauntries bestow alms and do other works of piety constitute ordinances and purchase lands to the value of £ a year within the liberty of the city for the founding of a chauntry of six priests to sing mass every day in the churches of the holy  Trinity  and St  Michael  for the soul of king  Edward  queen  Philippa  their children and for the souls of the gild and others Soon after  Isabel  queenmother assigned the land on this spot then called  Bablake  for the building a chapel in which masses were to be sung daily for the same purposes which was finished and dedicated in At length in licence was given for celebrating divine service here provided it might be done without injury to the motherchurch  Dugd W  i    ON the dissolution its revenues were found to be £  s    d  and that they supported a warden and eight priests who had chambers in the precinct a master of a grammarschool two singingclerks and two singingboys and several poor men who had been brethren of the gild The church has of late years  been rebuilt made a rectory by act of parlement in and settled on the master of the freeschool of  Coventry  Ecton      BEHIND this church is  Bablake  hospital  BABLAKE HOSPITAL  an old building with a court in the middle one part is occupied by  Bond  's almshouses founded in by  Thomas Bond  mayor of  Coventry  in for ten poor men and one poor woman with a priest to pray for the soul of the founder his grandfather father and all Christian souls At that time the revenues were £  s    d  In the first of  Edward  VIth's time they were vested in the city and the revenues being improved at present they maintain eighteen old men and a nurse each of whom have three shillings a week a black gown and other emoluments  Dugd W  i  About the year an infernal ambition of becoming chief of the house seized one of the almsmen who to attain his end poisoned eight of his bre∣thren five of whom instantly died On detection the wretch effected his own destruction by the same method and was buried with the usual marks of infamy Had his fortune flung him into a higher station his deeds would have paralleled him with  Cesar Borgia  or his more monstrous father Pope  Alexander  VI  THE other part of the building is allotted for the blue boys a foundation owing to a very singular accident Mr  Thomas Wheatly  mayor of  Coventry  in and ironmonger and card∣maker by trade sent his servant  Oughton  to  Spain  to buy some barrels of steel gads which he thought he did in open fair When they were brought home and examined they were found to contain cochineal and ingots of silver Mr  Wheatly  kept them for a considerable time in hopes of discovering the owner  for his servant did not know from whom he bought them At length he applied the profits as well as much of his own estate for the support of poor children  FROM thence my walk was continued along the west side of the city  CANAL  to  Bishopgatestreet  A little without is the head of the great canal which passing by the neighboring collieries at  Hawkesbury  is to

of the commerce of  Thames  the  Severn  and the  Trent  had  Britain  flourished in the manner it did when these vast designs were undertaken in the full intoxi∣cation of its prosperity At present it is only finished as far as  Atherston  AT the lower end of this street is the freeschool it sprung out of an hospital  FREE SCHOOL  founded in the beginning of the reign of  Henry  II by  Laurence  prior of  Coventry  and his convent at the request of  Edmund  archdeacon of  Coventry  for the reception of the sick and needy At the dissolution  John Hales  a gentleman  who had large share in the plunder of the church and having neither wife or child converted this foundation which he had purchased at a very cheap rate into a free school and endowed it with CC marks a year in land At first the boys were in∣structed in the church of the  White Friers  but the magistrates finding that Mr  Hales  had bought the lands but not the church took advantage of the flaw and removed the scholars to the pre∣sent place and pulled down the church  Dugd W  i  The chapel now re∣duced to one aile is the present school and the master resides in the house belonging to the antient master of the hospital The school has also a library belonging to it  PASS by  Cookstreet Gate  on the outside of the city and a little further by the  Three Virgins  or  Priory Gate  between which there is a complete part of the wall On the outside was a paved road in imitation of the military way from turret to turret on the famed wall of  Severus  Tour Scotl  vol iii  and besides here were four others which went a mile each way from the city  AT a small distance without the  Priory Gate  is  Swanswell Pool  which supplies the city with water This did belong to the priory but was at the dissolution purchased by the corporation from the crown  Dugd W  i    FROM hence I returned to the priory  PRIORY  seated on the south side of the brook  Sherburn  What bears that name is an uninhabited house of much later date than that monastery but built on some part of the site of this great foundation  ABOUT the year earl  Leofric  and his fair countess more than repaired the loss in in the destruction of the famous  Saxon  nunnery by founding in its stead a magnificent monastery They placed here an abbot and twentyfour monks of the  Bene∣dictine  order enriched the very walls and the church with massy gold and silver and endowed it with half the town and twentyfour manors All this they did with the advice of king  Edward  the Confessor and the reigning pope and dedicated the church to the honor of God and his blessed mother St  Peter  St  Osburg  and all saints The pious founders were buried according to the custom of the times in the porches for the distasteful custom of church interment did not prevale till long after  THE first abbot was  Leofrin  but that dignity was of short du∣ration for on the removal of the see of  Lichfield  to this place in by  Robert de Limisie  the office was suppressed the bishop being in such cases always esteemed supreme of the house  Willis's Abbeys  i  in his stead a prior was appointed but without derogating from the honor of the house for the priors were barons in parlement as well as the preceding abbots and the place a mitred abbey This first prelate was more attracted by the wealth of the house than by any spiritual call for he at once scraped from a single beam five hundred marks worth of silver in order to carry on the intrigue at  Rome  against the poor monks He reduced them to such short commons that he depressed their spirits discouraged all sorts of knowlege among them and in short rendered them too dejected to think of obtaining any redress  THIS was a prelude to greater misfortunes In the latter end of the following century  Hugh Novani  a  Norman  became bishop He soon fell at variance with the monks who in a synod held  before the high altar doubtless on some high provocation broke his head with the holy cross  Tantaene animis caelestibus irae  This enraged the proud prelate as he was called by those meek monks to lay his complaint against them at  Rome  The pope attended to it expelled the antient inhabitants and placed in their room a set of secular canons The monks now driven into the wild world had only the satisfaction of seeing their per∣secutor struck with deep remorse for in lying on his deathbed in the abbey of  Bec  in  Normandy  he was seized with fierce horrors at his conduct towards those holy men implored forgiveness and desired their intercession with the Almighty in his behalf He requested to be buried in the habit of the order that he might receive the benefit of its protection in the other world and finally consigned himself to purgatory  ibi in diem ju∣dicii cruciandus  LUCKILY at the time of this event  Thomas  a monk of  Coven∣try  happened to be at  Rome  soliciting the cause of his brethren he so enraged  Innocent  III then pope by his importunities as to order him to withdraw The poor monk with tears replied  Another pope will come to whom I shall not sue in vain I therefore will patiently wait your death as I have that of your two predecessors  "Here is a devil of a fellow" says his Ho∣liness in high wrath to his attendants  by St  Peter  He shall not wait for my death so I will not put him off any longer but make out the purpose of his petition before I put a morsel more into my mouth  Dugdale W  i    THIS troublesome affair ended they were replaced with double advantage their privileges as if by way of atonement for their short sufferings increased beyond all reason for in the time of  Edward  III they obtained that they and their tenants except those who held by knight service more than half a knight's see should be quit of murder robbery suit to the county or hundred courts aid to the sheriffs view of frankpledge and repair of the king's castles or pools  Dugdale  i  Reign after reign they received fresh emoluments so that in the end it became possessed of re∣venues to the amount of £  s    d  or after reprises £  s    d  Tanner      AMONG the sacred furniture was an image of the Virgin  Mary  adorned with a chain of gold enriched with gems bestowed by the Countess  Godeva  on her deathbed to which the devotees were to say as many prayers as there were in it precious stones  AND besides this an arm of St  Augustine  of  Hippo  which  Agelnethus  archbishop of  Canterbury  in bought at  Rome  from the pope for the small sum of C talents of silver and one of gold  Dugdale W  i  Goodwin      BUT even this arm had not power to ward off the blow given by the more irresistible one of  Henry  VIII who not content with the expulsion of its inhabitants and seizure of the revenues di∣rected this noble pile to be levelled with the ground which he did notwithstanding the earnest prayers of its bishop  Rowland Lee  one of his most servile tools A deed equally wanton and impious  THE loss is the more to be regretted as this cathedral is sup∣posed to have been built on the model of that of  Lichfield  and equally beautiful Nothing remains except a fragment consti∣tuting part of a private house to be seen with difficulty and after some search The palace stood between the priory and Saint  Michael  's and was sold in for its materials to  Nathaniel Lacy  and  Obadiah Chambers  for the sum of an hundred guineas The last prior  Thomas Camsel  in was prevaled on to make a surrender of the house either through fear of death for with∣standing the tyrant's pleasure or through lucre of pension for he had not less than £  s    d  annuity besides other al∣lowances to the monks  Stevens  i  Willis's Abbeys  i  The site was then granted to  John Combes  and  Richard Stansfield  after flourishing under monastic government above five hundred years  WHEN the cathedral was standing  Coventry  possessed a match∣less group of churches all standing within one coemetery  ST MICHAEL'S CHURCH  Saint  Michael  's at present is a specimen of the most beautiful steeple in  Europe  a tower enriched with faintly figures on the sides an octagon rising out of it and that lengthened into a most elegant spire Every part is so finely proportionable that it is no wonder that Sir  Christopher Wren  spoke of it as a master∣piece of architecture The outside is extremely handsome the inside light and lofty consisting of a body and two ailes divided by four rows of high and airy pillars and arches The height of the steeple and length of the church are the same three hundred and three feet the width of the latter an hundred and four  IN king  Stephen  's time this church was a chapel to the monks became afterwards a vicarage and on the dissolution fell to the gift of the crown This  Trinity  and St  John  's form the pa∣rishes of this great city so numerous are the dissenters  ITS beautiful steeple was begun in the reign of  Edward  III in by two brothers  Adam  and  William Bota  at their own charges which amounted annually to one hundred pounds nor was it finished in less than twenty years By the stile of architecture I agree with Sir  William Dugdale  that the present body was built in the reign of  Henry  VI Some ornament was also added to the steeple at the same time  Coventry  seems to have been particu∣larly favored by  Henry  or to speak more properly of that meek prince by the heroine  Margaret  for this city used to be stiled the secret harbour of that queen  TRINITY church and its spire would be spoken of as a most beautiful building was it not eclipsed by its unfortunate vicinity to St  Michael  's Within are two epitaphs which I give for their singularity One is on  Philemon Holland  the famous translator He was schoolmaster and physician in the city A wag made this

but none greater than by his translation of  Cambden  in that great antiquarian's lifetime and by his consent to whose work he made considerable additions  HE wrote a great folio with one pen and as he tells us did not wear it out  With one sole pen I writ this book  Made of a grey goose quill  A pen it was when it I took  A pen I leave it still  Fuller's Worthies      AT length if I may be

I surveyed with indignation such as antiquaries experience the site of the elegant and antient cross till of late years such an ornament to the city  CROSS  I am not furnished with an apology for the corporation who destroyed this beautiful building so must leave it doubtful whether the gothic resolution was the result of want of money or want of taste In the city paid it such respect as to expend £  s    d  in its repair  Dugdale W  i    IT was built or rather begun in to replace another  cross taken down some years before The founder was Sir  Wil∣liam Hollies  lord mayor of  London  and son of  Thomas Hollies  of  Stoke  near this city who left by his will two hundred pounds towards the design The base was hexangular finely ornamented with gothic sculpture above rose three stories of most light and elegant tabernaclework lessening to the summit In the niches were saints and  English  monarchs from  Henry  II to  Henry  V and around each story variety of pretty figures with flags with the arms of  England  or the rose of  Lancaster  expressed on them and on the summit of the uppermost plate Justice and other gracious attributes  A LITTLE south of St  Michael  's  ST MARY HALL  stands St  Mary Hall  at pre∣sent used for corporationassemblies This place was built in the beginning of the reign of  Henry  VI a venerable pile whose en∣trance is beneath a large gateway over which are the figures of a king and queen sitting probably  Henry  and his consort  Mar∣garet  Within this building is a fine old room in the upper end is a noble semicircular window divided into nine parts ele∣gantly painted with figures of several of our monarchs with coats of arms and ornaments but now very imperfect those in the win∣dows on the one side are lost several of those on the other are entire and were designed to represent some of our great nobility who had honored this hall with their presence as brothers and sisters of the gild for whose use this hall was founded This had been the gild of St  Katherine  established by certain citi∣zens of  Coventry  in by licence of  Edward  III after which it was united to those of the  Holy Trinity Our Lady  and Saint  John the Baptist  THE

former had  sely betrayed a private conversation in which he said that  M  bray  had dropt several expressions of a treasonable nature The accusation was denied and according to the barbarous  sage of the times  Mowbray  demanded the privilege of acquit∣  ng himself by single combat Each of the dukes agreeable to the laws of chivalry flung down his glove which was taken up before the king and sealed  Polychronico  xxi    I suppose to prevent any future den  al of the challenge The king appointed  Coventry  for the place of combat and caused for that purpose a vast and magnifi∣cent theatre to be erected on this green  Ricar  II  The rival dukes  de all requisite preparation and particularly about the essen∣tial article armour  Froissar  relates the steps they took which  hews the preference which was given to foreign armourers  I shall deliver in the words of his noble translator  Sir  John Bourchier  Lord      These two lordes made provision for that was necessarye  for them for their battayle The Earl of  Derby  The  of  Hereford  sent his  ssangers in to  Lombardy  to the Duke of  Myllayn  Sir  Gal    for to have armure at his pleasure The duke agreed  the erles desyre and caused the knight that the erle had sent  whose name was  Fraunces  to se all the dukes armorye  wh  n the knight had chosen such as he lyked than the duke  rthermore for love of the erle of  Derby  he sent four of the best armourers that were in  Lombardy  to y  e  erle into  Englande  with the knight to  henten  y  t  thei shuld arme make armure accordyng to the cries entent The  Erle Marshal  on his part  and in to other places to provyde him for the journey The charge of these two lords was greate But the Erle of  Derby  was at mooste charge  THE armour of the great men was uncommonly splendid and expensive usually inlaid with gold and silver with most elegant devices and patterns That of  Francis  I in possession of Mr  W  p  e  and that of  George  Earl of  Cumberland  at  Appleby  castle exist as specimens of the great attention given to that circum∣stance Besides beauty the utmost regard was paid to the essen∣tial requisite of its being proof This was to be the result of the  of the a  m  ourer not of artmagic for the combatants  ere to clear themselves by oath from having any commerce with  any or of rendering their armour or bodies invul∣nerable by any charm Let their cause be ever so bad they de∣termined to die like good Christians disavowed all dependence on the power of  Satan  and supplicated the prayers of the pious    Ad  roof unto my armour with thy prayers  And with thy blessings steel my lance's point  II in a speech of  Hereford  on this occasion    I SHALL give the consequence of this important affair in the very graphical words of honest  Holinshed  who minutely describes the pomp and ceremony preceding the resolution taken by the unfortunate monarch which in the end cost him his crown and life  At the time appointed the king came to  Coventrie  where the two dukes were readie according to the order prescribed therein comming thither in great arraie accompanied with the lords and gentlemen of their linages The king caused a sumptuous scaffold or theater and roial listes there to be erected and prepared The  Sundaie  before they should fight after dinner the duke of  Hereford  came to the king being lodged about a quarter of a mile without the town in a tower that belonged to Sir  William Bagot  to take his leave of him The morrow after being the daie appointed for the combat about the spring of the daie came the duke of  Norfolke  to the court to take leave likewise of the king The duke of  Here∣ford  armed him in his tent that was set up neere to the lists and the duke of  Norfolke  put on his armor betwixt the gate and the barrier of the town in a beautiful house having a fair perclois of wood towards the gate that none might see what was done within the house  The duke of  Aumarle  that daie being high constable of  England  and the duke of  Surrie  marshal placed themselves betwixt them well armed and appointed And when they saw their time they first entered into the lists with a great company of men apparelled in silke sendal imbrodered with silver both richlie and curiouslie everie man having a tipped staff to keep the field in order About the houre of prime came to the barriers of the lists the duke of  Hereford  mounted on a white courser barded with green and blew velvet imbroi∣dered sumptuously with swans and antelopes of goldsmiths worke armed at all points The constable and marshal came to the barriers demanding of him what he was he answered  'I am  Henrie  of  Lancaster  duke of  Hereford  which am come hither to do mine indevor against  Thomas Mowbraie  duke of  Norfolke  as a traitor untrue to God the king his realme and me'Then incontinentlie he sware upon the holie Evangelists that his quarrel was true just and upon that point he re∣quired to enter the lists Then he puts up his sword which before he held up naked in his hand and putting down his visor made a cross on his horsse and with speare in hand entered into the lists and descended from his horsse and set him down in a chaire of green velvet at the one end of the lists and there reposed himself abiding the comming of his adversarie  Soone after him entered into the field with great triumph King  Richard  accompanied with all the peerses of the realme and in his companie was the earle of  Saint Paule  which was come out of  France  in post to see this challenge performed The king had there above ten thousand men in armour least some fraie or tumult might rise amongst his nobles by quar∣relling or partaking When the king was set in his seat which was richly hanged and adorned a king at arms made open proclamation prohibiting all men in the name of the king and of the high constable and marshal to enterprise or attempt to approach or touch any part of the lists upon pain of death except such as were appointed to order or marshal the field The proclamation ended another herald cried 'Behold here  Henrie  of  Lancaster  duke of  Hereford  appelant which is entered into the lists roiall to do his devoir against  Thomas Mowbraie  duke of  Norfolke  defendant upon paine to be found false recreant  The duke of  Norfolke  hovered on horsseback at the entrie of the lists his horsse being barded with crimson velvet imbro∣dered richlie with lions of silver and mulberie trees and when he had made his oth before the constable and marshal that his quarrel was just true he entered the field manfullie saieng aloud 'God and him that hath the right' and then he departed from his horsse sate him downe in his chaire which was of crimson velvet courtined about with white and red damaske The lord marshall viewed their spears to see that they were of equall length and delivered the one speare himself to the Duke of  Hereford  and sent the other unto the Duke of  Norfolke  by a knight then the herald proclamed that the traverses chaires of the champions should be removed commanding them on the king's behalf to mount on horssebacke and address themselves to the battel and combat  Holinshed's Chr      The duke of  Hereford  was quicklie horssed and closed his bauier and cast his speare into the rest and when the trum∣pet founded set forward couragiouslie towards his enemie six or seven pases The duke of  Norfolke  was not fullie set for∣ward when the king cast downe his warder and the heralds cried 'Ho ho' Then the king caused their speares to be taken from them and commanded them to repaire againe to their chaires where they remained two long houres while the king and his councell deliberatlie consulted what order was best to be had in so weightie a cause Finallie after they had devised and fullie determined what should be done therein  the heralds cried 'Silence' and Sir  John Bushie  the king's secretarie read the sentence and determination of the king and his councell in a long roll the effect whereof was that  Henrie  duke of  Hereford  should within fifteene daies depart out of the realme and not to returne before the terme of ten yeares were expired except by the king he should be repealed againe and this upon paine of death and that  Thomas Mow∣braie  duke of  Norfolke  bicause he had sowen sedition in the relme by his words should likewise avoid the realme and ne∣ver returne againe into  England  nor approch the borders or confines thereof upon pain of death and that the king would sta  e the profits of his lands till he had levied thereof such summes of monie as the duke had taken up of the king's trea∣suror for the wages of the garrison of  Calis  which were still unpaid  When these judgements were once read the king called be∣fore him both parties and made them to sweare that the one should never come in place where the other was willinglie nor keepe any companie togither in any forren region which oth they both received humblie and so went their waies The duke of  Norfolke  departed sorrowfullie out of the realme into  Almanie  and at the last came into  Venice  where he for thought and melancholie deceassed for he was in hope as writers record that he should have beene borne out in the matter by the king which when it fell out otherwise it greeved him not a little The duke of  Hereford  tooke his leave of the king at  Eltham  who there released foure yeares of his banishment so he tooke his jornie over into  Calis  and from thence went into  France  where he remained  A woonder it was to see what number of people ran after him in everie towne and street where he came before he tooke the sea lamenting and bewailing his departure as who should saie that when he departed the onlie shield defense and comfort of the commonwealth was vaded and gone  ABOUT two miles from  Coventry  I crossed the little river  Sow  at  Binly  bridge a little beyond which stands the beautiful small church of the name dedicated to St  Bartholomew  BINLY CHURCH  formerly be∣longing to the monks of  Coventry  now a curacy in the gift of Lord  Craven  who rebuilt the church with uncommon elegance The roof is coved and ornamented with scriptural histories in form of medallions and with pious ornaments of crosses crowns and thorns and other decorations adapted to the place The altar is in a tribune with marble pillars and its window consists of glass painted with a fine holy family by Mr  William Pecket  Combe Abbey  or to spell it with propriety  Cwm  from its low situation  COMBE ABBEY  lies about two miles farther Notwithstanding its con∣version to the seat of a nobleman it retains in part the form of its conventual state The cloisters are preserved on three sides of the antient court glazed as when occupied by the antient owners and their walls enriched with the spoils of the chace Methinks the jovial abbot is now before me formed out of the monk so admirably described by old  Chaucer  A monk ther was a fayre for the maistrie  An out rider that loved venerie  A manly man to ben an abbot able  Full many a deinte hors hadde he in stable  And when he rode men mighte his bridel here  Gingeling in a whistling wind as clere  And eke as loude as doth the chapell belle  Ther as this lord was keper of the celle  The rule of Seint  Maure  and of Seint  Beneit  Because that it was olde somedele streit  This ilke monk lette olde thinges pace  And held after the newe world the trace  He yave not of the text a pulled hen  That saith that hunters ben not holy men  Ne that a monk when he is rekkeles  Is like a fish that is waterles  This is to say a monk out of his cloistre  This ilke text held he not worth an oistre  And I say his opinion was good  What shulde he studie make himselven wood  Upon a book in cloistre alway to pore  Or swinken with his hondes laboure  As  Austin  bit How shall the world be served  Let  Austin  have his swink to him reserved  Therefore he was a prickasoure a right  Greihounds he hadde as swift as soul of flight  Of pricking of hunting for the hare  Was all his lust for no cost wolde he spare  THE abbot is now represented by a jovial  English  baron not less a lover of the generous exercise He derives his right to the place from his ancestor Sir  William Craven  Knight great grand∣son of  Henry Craven  elder brother to Sir  William  lord mayor of  London  in one of the richest men of his time It was purchased from that squanderer  Lucy  countess of  Bedford  who in∣herited it from her brother Lord  Harrington  who derived it from his mother  Anne  daughter of  Robert Kelway  who received  it in lease after the forfeiture of  John Dudley  duke of  Northumber∣land  to whom it had been granted by  Edward  VI It had been founded by  Richard de Camville  in and peopled with  Cis∣tercian  monks  FOUNDER  who were at the dissolution found to be endowed with upwards of three hundred pounds a year  Tanner    Robert Bates

the deed rested in the former  THAT accomplished nobleman Lord  Harrington  was the re∣founder of this house which  Cambden  says arose from the ashes of the antient abbey His taste is evident in his preservation of the venerable cloisters It is indebted to the owners of the pre∣sent name for its instructive furniture of portraits probably en∣tirely to the hero  William Craven  a most

friend  Gustavus Adolphus  in  NEAR him is his queen dressed in black and with a melan∣choly look She was the daughter of our peaceful monarch  James  I who either through hatred of war or disapprobation of his soninlaw's ambition reluctantly undertook his defence and made under  Mansfield  an unfortunate essay His daughter  Eli∣zabeth  supported her unhappy situation with uncommon dignity and shewed amidst the most distressful poverty an illustrious example of magnanimity She visited the army of  Gustavus  which had in view her husband's restoration as well as the giving liberty to the  German  Protestants The  English  volunteers seem to have fought her battles inspired by love She was the admi∣ration of the camp and had votaries among every nation The young  Craven  was among her warmest devotees and continued his attachment to the last moment of her life possessed her de∣served confidence directed all her affairs and gave a most distin∣guishing proof of his esteem by building for her use at his estate in  Berkshire  a magnificent palace The difference of rank alone  prevented the publication of their union which is generally sup∣posed to have taken place Her spotless fame was never aspersed with improper connection  I MUST step to another room the picturegallery for the por∣trait of her admirer a fine head with the body armed and crossed with a sash Let me finish his history with saying that after the death of  Gustavus  he retired from the  Swedish  army into the service of the  Dutch  and notwithstanding he never interfered in the civil wars of his own country yet in his estates were confiscated by the parlement as is said through false accu∣sations of favors done the exiled king On the restoration he came over and in on the death of the Duke of  Albemarle  he was appointed colonel of the  Coldstream  regiment of guards His gallant spirit never forsook him he braved the pestilence in its greatest fury and with a few other worthies undertook the care of  London  in during the desolation of the plague and in every fire was so active in preventing the devastation of that other scourge that it was said  his very horse smelt it out

 His picture is a head with short grey hair his body in rich  rmour with a sash From this the print by  Simon Pass  was    A REMARKABLE legend of  Otto  or  Otho  I earl of  Oldenberg  re∣presented as wearied with the chace and separated from his com∣passions on a wild mountain When he was almost fainting with  a beautiful virgin in white with long flowing hair and a  land on her head bursts out of the side of the hill and offers him drink out of a rich horn which she put into his hand assur∣  him that if he drank prosperity would attend him and his house He disliked the proposal suspecting deceit According∣ly pouring some of the liquor on the hind part of his horse found it so noxious as to take off the hair He instantly rode off  the horn full speed terrified at the adventure and the

the city on the left side of the road stood the  Chartreux  now inhabited by  Inge  Esquire Little of the antient building remains The wall of the precinct is still stand∣ing and in a wall in the garden are the marks of many small doors the entrance into the cells of the austere inhabitants  THIS religious house arose from the pious intentions of  William  Lord  Zouch  of  Harringworth  in  Northamptonshire  who obtain∣ing in fourteen acres of land in this place from Sir  Baldwyn Frevile  the elder determined on that to erect a monas∣tery of  Carthusians  and endow it with ample revenues Death prevented the execution but in his last illness he left sixty pounds towards a future establishment  THE design was speedily completed by various pious persons  Richard Luff  a mayor of  Coventry  and  Richard Botoner  a fellowcitizen bestowed four hundred marks on the churchchoir clois∣ters  and three cells others followed their example  Richard  II on his return from  Scotland  in assumed the honor of being the founder and at the instance of his queen  Anne  laid the first stone of the church with his own hands declaring in the pre∣sence of his nobility and of the mayor and citizens of  Coventry  that he would bring it to perfection After this it received con∣siderable endowments and at the dissolution was found accor∣ding to  Dugdale  to be possessed of £  s    d  above all re∣prizes The prior seemed to want the resolution of this severe and conscientious order for more of this than any other resisted the will of their cruel monarch and underwent martyrdom in support of the trusts committed to them It is probable that  John Bochard  the last who presided over the house was prevaled on to surrender for the consideration of the great pension of forty pounds a year after which it was granted to  Richard Andrews  and  Leonard Chamberlain  A LITTLE farther I crossed the  Sherbourn  leaving on the right  Whitley  WHITLEY  a large old house in which  Charles  I resided during the attempt upon  Coventry  I was told that the history of many of his actions had been painted on the wainscot About a mile and a half from hence I passed the  Avon  at  Finford  bridge This is the river that runs by  Warwick  and  Stratford  and discharges itself into the  Severn  near  Tewkesbury  still retaining the  British  name  Afon  or river as is the case with several others watering  English  ground  ASCEND an extensive brow commanding a rich and vast view toward the north and west On the summit is a  tumulus  from which the spot which gives name to the hundred is called  Knightlow  KNIGHTLOW  or mount It seems to have been sepulchral and to  have covered the ashes of some  Roman eques  or knight from which it was denominated It lies very near a great  Roman  road as customary with similar memorials On it in aftertimes stood a cross on whose base the inhabitants of several towns in this hundred still attend and pay the dues to the lord on  Martinmass  day the sums are from  d  to  s    d  each These rents are called  Wrothmoney  and  Warth  or  Swarff penny  and are sup∣posed by  Dugdale  to be the same as wardpenny  Vicecomiti aut aliis castellanis persoluti ob castrorum praesidium vel excubias agendas  They must be paid at this cross before sunrise and the party paying must go thrice round the cross say  wrothmoney  and put it into the hole in

 High Cross  on the verge of  Leicestershire  where it is intersected by the great  Watlingstreet  and traverses direct to  Stafford upon Foss  near the edge of  Glocestershire  Go over  Dunsmore  heath now inclosed and after riding in a tedious avenue of elms and firs for five miles reach  Dunchurch  or the church on the hill a small village whose church once be∣longed to the monks of  Pipwell  in  Northamptonshire  DESCEND the hill and about three miles further go near  Willoughby  or the  place of willows  a little village  WILLOUGHBY  with a church dedicated to St  Nicholas  formerly appropriated to the hospital of St  John  without  Eastgate Oxford  now in the patronage of  Magdalen College  This bottom at present enlivened with the windings of the canal assumes a commercial appearance by the number of new buildings rising on its banks and the magazines  of coal and limestone laid up for sale The former gives a most comfortable prospect to the halfstarved inhabitants of  Northamp∣tonshire  by flattering them with the speedy approximation of the means of warmth and giving to their poor good fuel instead of the wretched substitute of horsedung which they collect in scanty portions for that purpose  IT would be ungrateful to leave  Warwickshire  without paying a tribute to the memory of Mr  Henry Beighton  author of the map of this county surveyed by him in and As it was the earliest so it was the best performance of the kind He had an estate of about a hundred a year in the parish of  Coton  in this county He assisted his income by surveying in which for elegance accuracy and expedition he had few equals He left behind him in his neighborhood numbers of excellent surveyors who own him for their master His account of  London  bridge in the  Philosophical Transactions  shews his skill in mechanics He was interred at  Chilvers Coton  where a small monument barely tells that he lived and died without men∣tioning his merit neglected by his countrymen during life for he never met with encouragement to publish his admirable map which was done about the year  He begun his survey in and finished it in  by subscription for the support of his widow  FROM  Willoughby  I instantly entered NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  BRAUNSTON  in the parish of  Braunston  The village church with spire steeple and the number of narrow inclosures appear on the side  of a slope on the left of the road This is among the few places I neglected to visit I must therefore speak from Mr  Bridges  Twentysix  of its cross twentyfour feet high of the effigy of the Knight Templar in the church and of the instance of the longevity of  William Bren  of this village who attained the age of an hundred and twentyone  AFTER the Conquest the  D' Aiencourts  and the  Peverels  held land here From the last it fell by marriage to  Albricius de Harcourt  by his daughter to  William de Trussebot  a man raised from a low situation by his desperate valour to great estates In the reign of king  Stephen  being attacked in  Bonville  of which he was governor he set fire to his own house in four places which so terrified the enemy that they instantly evacuated the town  BY his daughter  Roese  it fell to  Everard de Roos  a family who flourished here for several centuries a distinguished race One of them  William  was clamant to the crown of  Scotland  under the arbitration of  Edward  I  Sir  David Dalrymple's Annals Scotl  i  They became extinct in the male line in the reign of  Henry  VII when  Elinor  eldest sister of the last Lord  Roos  conveyed it by marriage to Sir  Robert Manners  and it was sold by his descendant  Henry  earl of  Rutland  who died in to  Gregory Isham  of  London  merchant a younger son of the respectable and antient family of that name  THE present lord of the manor is  Web  Esquire who keeps in the small manorhouse a courtleet and baron  SINGULAR TENURE  The te∣nure of a considerable portion of land in the parish is very singular If a widow appears at the next court after her hus∣band's death and presents a leathern purse with a groat in it she  can keep her husband's copyhold lands for life but she must at∣tend every court after she has done this service  FROM  Dunchurch  the country grows hilly and till of late un∣inclosed pleasant during the verdure of the young and the rich yellow of the ripened corn About three miles from  Braunston  appears  Daventry  DAVENTRY  on the side and top of a hill The place is populous and carries on a considerable manufacture of whips is an incorporated town governed by a bailiff twelve burgesses and a recorder has two serjeants at mace and one townclerk The bailiff for the time is justice of the peace and also the year following and is likewise coroner of the inquest The ser∣jeants may arrest any within their jurisdiction for a sum under one hundred pounds and the cause is to be decided here No county justice hath power in this place the justices of the bo∣rough having power of commitment to the countyjail in crimi∣nal causes The inhabitants also enjoy the privilege of exemp∣tion from serving on juries at the county assizes  ITS charter is said to have been first granted by king  John  and was renewed by queen  Elizabeth  The place is of considerable antiquity especially if we give into the derivation of its name  Dwy Avon tre  the town of the two  Avons  or rivers from its situation between them Certainly it was a place of note at the Conquest had in it sixteen ploughlands in the manor three with three slaves twenty villeyns a presbyter and ten boors and twelve acres of meadow It had been worth three pounds after that event improved to eight  THIS was part of the great possessions of the countess  Judith  niece to the Conqueror whom he had married to the brave  Waltheof  earl of  Northumberland  and farther to engage his fide∣lity  he gave with her this county and that of  Huntingdon Wal∣theof  unfortunately engaged in a conspiracy and notwithstanding he repented and flung himself at the king's mercy was beheaded in at the instigation of his wife  Order Vital  It seems she had cast a favorable eye on another person but was disappointed for the king offered to her  Simon de Liz  a noble  Norman  lame of one leg him she rejected which so enraged her uncle that he de∣prived her of the two earldoms and gave them to  De Liz  with her eldest daughter which obliged  Judith  to a state of peniten∣tial widowhood during life  HERE are some remains of the priory  PRIORY  inhabited by poor fami∣lies The place is easily discovered by several gothic windows and a door accessible by a great flight of steps Four  Cluniac  monks were originally placed at  Preston Capes  in this county by  Hugh de Leycester  sheriff of the county and steward to  Maud  sister to the first  S Liz  earl of  Huntingdon  but finding the situa∣tion inconvenient for want of water he built a priory here to which place he removed them about the year It was dedicated to St  Augustine  and was subordinate to St  Mary de Caritate  Tanner    Its spiritualities were valued at £  s    d per annum  its temporalities £  s    d  Cardinal  Wolsey  made five of his emissaries to pick a quarrel with the poor monks about certain lands of theirs and causing the dispute to be referred to himself took occasion to dissolve the house and as  Stow  says to be given to his own college  But of this irreligious robbery done of no conscience but to patch up pride which private wealth could not furnish what punish∣ment  hath since ensued by God's hand sayeth mine author partly

well known and valued worth two hundred pounds became in three years so poore that he begged till his dyingday and the fift called Doctor  Allane  being cheefe executor of these doings was cruelly maimed in  Ireland  even at such time as he was bishop  Annals    The pious his∣torian then traces the judgment to the cardinal who died under the king's displeasure to the colleges which occasioned the sacri∣lege that of  Ipswich  being pulled down that of  Christchurch  never finished under  Wolsey  's patronage and lastly to the pope who permitted these violences on religious houses for he was besieged in his holy see and suffered a long imprisonment  THE parishchurch had been the conventual  CHURCH  of late years it was handsomely rebuilt but is no more than a curacy in the gift of  Christchurch  college The arms of the college and of the earl of  Winchelsea  lord of the manor grace the east window  FROM  Daventry  I visited the noted camps on  Boroughhill  BOROUGHHILL  or  Daneshill  about a mile southeast of the town It is lofty and insulated The area is of an oblong or oval form about a mea∣sured mile in length and near two in circumference The whole is surrounded by two three or four deep trenches and the same number of great ramparts or banks according as the strength or weakness of the ground required These  run on the margin of the hill and on the slope and hav∣ing the entrance on the eastern and western sides opposite to each other  WITHIN the area near the middle is a bank which passes strait from the western side towards the eastern the remainder is destroyed Farther on is the vestige of another running paral∣lel These when entire would have formed a rectangular camp by the assistance of part of the ditches on the sides of the hill  NEAR this camp are several  tumuli  of the sepulchral kind but since Mr  Morton  's time their number is evidently lessened for in his days he informs us there were eighteen  THE northern end of the hill is formed into a third camp of a circular shape and of vast strength Two ditches of prodigious depth with suitable ramparts and a deep entrance cross the area and fall into the general surrounding ditches which have been deepened to add to the strength of the third part There is like∣wise the imperfect remains of another ditch and bank on the out∣side a little south designed to add to the security  ON the northwest part of the great rampart of this round camp is a great mount either exploratory or the spot where the chieftain pitched his tent  I MUST differ with Mr  Morton  about the makers of the first of these camps or posts which were the  Britons  themselves It has every agreement with the multitudes of others scattered over the kingdom and suits exactly with the description left by  Tacitus  of the method of defence used by our ancestors  Tunc montibus arduis et si qua clementer accedi poterunt in modum valli saxa praestruit  I  shall not here repeat what I have fully dwelt on in my Tours in  Wales  and  Scotland  Tour Scotl  part ii  Tour Wales      THIS post was in all probability made use of when the victo∣rious  Ostorius  was traversing this island to quell the commotions he found on his arrival in  Britain  It is evident that the  Britons  at this period made use of the same species of defence which is proved to have been common to the whole country The  Iceni  lodged themselves within a post of this kind against this very general  Locum pugnae delegere septum agresti aggere et aditu angus∣to ne pervius equis foret  Taciti Annal  lib xii c  but it did not avale The  Coritani  of these parts had recourse to the strong hold of what I dare say they called  Ben Avon  or the head over the river one of the streams which form the  Nen  the river of this country passing be∣neath  THIS post proved no obstacle to the Conqueror he found it sit for a station he contracted its limits east into the shape of the camps of his people and made this a summer station as he did the warm bottom near the fort a winter station Numbers of  Roman  coins found on the spots evince the conjecture The  Romans  as is frequently the case latinized the  British  name and formed from it their  Benvenna  which I beg leave to place here rather than at  Wedon  a place destitute of all classical traces  I MUST add that on the southeast side of  Boroughhill  about two or three hundred yards below the ditches is a lesser camp surrounded by a foss and bank Mr  Morton  guesses it to have  been the receptacle of the carriages of the greater camp I ima∣gine it to have been a  procestria  a sort of free post attendant often on camps where provisions and other necessaries were brought  As to the third division of the area of this hill it is probably  Saxon  the words  borough burgh berry  and  bury  being the constant appellation left by the  Saxons  to similar places It is my belief that every post of this nature occupied by that nation in our island had been originally  British  which they altered to their conceptions of strength and defence which was usually done by deepening the ditches raising the ramparts and clearing the area and often exalting one part into what was called the  dunjeon  or keep These places were stationary not properly camps for the antient  Germans  from whom these invaders were derived and whose cus∣toms they retained made use of no other defence to their camps than a barrier of waggons with which they formed the precinct  Omnes Barbari  says  Vegetius carris suis in orbem connexis ad simili∣tudinem castrorum securas a supervenientibus exigunt noctes  Lib iii c  Caesar  twice  Bell Gal  lib lib iv  mentions this custom among the  German  nations and I am told that even in later days this mode of defence has been used and called  Waggenburg  or the camp of  waggons  EVERY thing on this hill must not be attributed to remote an∣tiquity for  Charles  I a few days before the fatal battle of  Naseby  occupied this post and fortified it so possibly some of the entrenchments might be the work of the unfortunate mo∣narch  Whitelock      I MUST not quit this place without mentioning a spot which I overlooked  BURNT WALLS  This is what Mr  Morton  calls the  Burnt Walls  where many loads of walls and foundations have been dug up The precinct is about six acres and was moated round The water that filled the moat was conveyed from pools in  Daventry Park  a place not remote Tradition says that within the area stood a seat of  John  of  Gaunt  which is probable as this manor was once possessed by the earls and dukes of  Lancaster  in  Ed∣ward  III's time annexed to that dutchy and assigned to that great duke  Hist Northampt      CONTINUE my journey turn a little out of my road on the left  DODFORD CHURCH  to  Dodford  church and found there a tomb of a crosslegged knight armed in mail with both hands upon his sword as if in the attitude of drawing it On his shield are illblazoned  vaire argent  and  azure  two bars  gules  which denote the person here deposited to have been a  Keynes  one of the antient lords of the place and from the attitude of his legs to have lived during the fashionable madness of crusades  Two ladies in hoods recumbent said to have been two sisters coheiresses of the manor and probably  Margaret  and  Maud de Ayote  who were possessed of this manor I think in the time of  Richard  II which descended to their father  Laurence  from his mother  Lettice  sister to  William de Keynes  A BRASS plate of  William Wyde  who died owner of this place in and another of his wife  AN alabaster figure armed of  John Cressy  a successor of the former who distinguished himself in the  French  wars under the  duke of  Bedford  was captain of  Lycieux Orbef and Pontesque

the edge of  Leicestershire  passes close by  Boroughhill  and proceeds from  Wedon  to  Toucester  and  Stoney Stratford  where it enters the county of  Bucks  NEAR the sixtyeighth milestone is the entrance to the new turnpikeroad to  Northampton  which is above seven miles dis∣tant and on an eminence a little to the left is pleasantly seated the church and village of  Flore  or  Flower  A LITTLE beyond on the right lies the village of  Wedon on the Street  WEDON  or  Weedon Bec  from which I chuse to transfer the old  Bennevenna  to  Boroughhill  on account of deficiency of classical evidence at this place and the little difference of distance from the other stations  SUFFICIENT honor will remain to  Wedon  in allowing it to have been the site of the royal palace of  Wulfere  Bridges    the  Mercian  mo∣narch afterwards converted into a nunnery at the instance of his daughter St  Werburg  who presided for a time over it Here she performed the miracle of the wild geese who at her word forgot their nature were driven by her steward from their ravages among the corn into the grange and after receiving from her a severe check for their depredations were commanded to take wing and never appear in her demesns They obeyed in part but kept hovering about till one of their companions which had  been stolen and some say eaten by a servant was restored on which they bid an eternal adieu to the fields of  Wedon  Cressy's Cb Hist      THIS nunnery was destroyed by the  Danes  but the memory of the foundress was preserved in  Leland  's day by a fair chapel dedicated to that saint  Leland Itin  i    AFTER the Conquest  Roger de Thebovil  gave a moiety of lands in this monastery to the abbey of  Bec  in  Normandy  which was with many other grants to the same house confirmed by  Henry  II That abbey afterwards became possessed of the whole when it was made dependent on their great cell or priory at  Okeburn  in  Wilt∣shire  Vast privileges were bestowed in favor of the monks of this abbey such as exemption from suit and service to the county and hundred courts from toll passage and pontage and exemption from forest laws They had also free warren and right of determining in murder manslaughter  c c  all which perished at the dissolution of the priories and this manor as part of the possessions of  Okeburn  was vested in the provost and fellows of  Eton  college by  Henry  VI in which it still con∣tinues  Hist Northampt  in which Mr  Bridges  denies that there ever was a priory here as Sir  W Dugdale  and Bishop  Tanner  imagine    FROM hence I was led by my curiosity about two miles west∣ward  CASTLE DIKES  to  Castle Dikes  in the parish of  Farthingstone  remarkable for some antient works attributed to the  Saxons  They are placed on the brow of a steep hill commanding a vast view but at pre∣sent so overgrown with thick woods that I had but a very in∣distinct sight of them They appeared to comprehend near thir∣teen  acres of ground and to consist of strong holds divided from each other by a ditch of stupendous breadth and depth A plat called the  Castleyard  stands to the southwest of these entrenched on all sides but the southwest comprehending about seven acres on which tradition says a town was situated  MR  Morton  informs us that a vaulted room formed of squared stones was discovered in his time and beneath that another which falling in accidentally a smell resembling that of putrid carcases issued from it Two or three rude sculptures were also discovered among the rubbish  IT is conjectured that this place was burnt by the  Danes  for vast masses of cinders mixed with pebbles and clay have been found in different parts and many of the stones had on them the marks of fire  Mr  Morton    There is no account left of the particulars of their ravages so this rests upon conjecture as well as the notion of  Ethelfleda  having been founder of this place among her other great works performed in  ON my return to the great road about two miles from the place I visited the church of  StownineChurches  STOWNINECHURCHES  to see the most elegant tomb which this or any other kingdom can boast of that of  Elizabeth  fourth daughter of  John  lord  Latimer  wife first to Sir  John Danvers  of  Dantrey Wiltshire  and afterwards to Sir  Edmund Cary  third son of  Henry  lord  Hunsdon  Her figure is of white marble lying recumbent on a slab of black The attitude is the most easy possible that of one asleep her head covered with a loose hood reclines on a rich cushion One hand is placed on her breast the other lies on one side Round her neck is a  quilled ruff The fashionable stiffness of her embroidered stays is a disadvantage to this elegant sculpture Her gown flows to her feet in easy folds and covers them She lies on a long cloak lined with ermine fastened at her neck with rich jewels At her feet is a  griffin  holding a shield of the familyarms The whole rests on a white marble altartomb with inscriptions and arms on the sides After informing us of her parentage marriages and children are these lines  Sic familia praeclara  Praeclarior prole  Virtute praeclarissima  Aetatis  Anno  Dni

Gilbert de Gants  the  antient owners There were five of them The first was great nephew to the Conqueror the last died in  FROM hence I descended to the great road the country hilly and clayey The quarries are of a coarse grit stone often filled with shells but of too shattery a nature to be used except in or∣dinary buildings A few miles farther is an eminence called  Forster's Booth  so named from a booth erected here by one  Forster  a poor countryman It grew at length into a scattered street of several houses and carriers inns through which runs the  Wat∣lingstreet  road in a direct line to  Toucester  four miles distant  THIS is a pretty considerable town seated on a plain  TOUCESTER  on a small stream called the  Tove  from which the name is derived  Tou∣cester  or the castle on the  Tove  The great  tumulus  on the east side of the town points out of the site of the  speculum  or watch∣tower The  Roman  coins found in digging about prove it to have been an appendage to a  Roman  station whose name has ne∣ver reached us The  Saxons  profited of this little fortress and added the foss which surrounded it From them it received its present title of the  Bury  or  Borough  to which has been since added the double tautology of  Berry Mounthill  THE  Saxons  called the town  Tofeceastre  In the time of  Edward  the Elder it was almost ruined by the ravages of the  Danes  but in the king determined to restore it and for that purpose detached part of his forces who soon after their arrival were at∣tacked by the  Danes  resident in  Northampton  and  Leicester  Sax Chr    but assisted by the townsmen they repelled the barbarians and  Ed∣ward  in order to prevent future insults fortified the whole place  with a stone wall  Sax Chr    But time hath destroyed every vestige of it  THIS manor after various changes became the property of the famous Sir  Richard Empson  one of the instruments of the avarice and oppression of  Henry  VII who in lost his head with  Edmund Dudley  on  Towerhill  perhaps more deservedly than le∣gally  Empson  had been the son of a sievemaker in this town by his great abilities in the profession of the law he was promoted to the chancellorship of the duchy of  Lancaster  but by his un∣bounded submission to the will of his rapacious master fell a vic∣tim in the next reign to the demands of an enraged nation At present the manor belongs to the Earl of  Pomfret  who derives it from his ancestor  Richard Fermor  a merchant of  Calais  and a younger brother of the antient house of  Fermors  of  Oxford∣shire  THERE was a church here at the Conquest  CHURCH  which was given by the Conqueror to the abbey of St  Wandragasile  in  Normandy  In the present is nothing remarkable excepting the tomb of  William Sponne  archdeacon of  Norfolk  and rector of this parish in the reign of  Henry  VI who founded here a college and chantry for two priests to say mass for his soul and the souls of his friends At the dissolution it was worth £  s    d  a year  Tanner    He was also a great benefactor to the town and his charities are still felt here governed by feoffees consisting of fifteen of the principal inha∣bitants  HIS figure is represented recumbent dressed in a red gown which reaches round his feet with ermine hood and sleeves Be∣neath is another representation of him after death with a sunk  nose and emaciated body and all the changes wrought by that fell monster on the human frame  THE town is supported by the great concourse of passengers and by a manufacture of lace and a small one of silk stockings The first was imported from  Flanders  and carried on with much success in this place and still more in the neighboring county of  Buckingham  I TOOK a walk about a mile east of the town to see  EastonNeston  EASTONNESTON  the seat of the Earl  Pomfret  The wings were built by Sir  Christopher Wren  in the center by  Hawkesmore  about twenty years after who is said to have

from  Thomas  son of Sir  Richard Empson  The antient house stood below the church in a park inclosed by Sir  Richard  by licence from  Henry  VII at the time it came into the possession of Mr  Fermor  He lived here with boundless hospitality till the year when for sending  d  and a couple of shirts to one  Nicholas Thane  his confessor then in prison at  Buckingham  for denying the king's supremacy he incurred the tyrant's displea∣sure He fell under a praemunire and in his oldage being stripped of all he had was forced to live with the parson of  Wapenham  whom he had presented which he did for seve∣ral years with consummate piety and resignation  Bridges      THE recovery of part of his fortune was owing to a singular accident During his prosperous days he kept as usual in those

Collins's Peerage  v  but died before it could be effected His pious successor  Edward  VI restored to him this manor that of  Touces∣ter  and some others of his estates and added many grants by way of compensation for the injury done him but all fell short of the great losses he had sustained from the cruel father He returned to his house which he enjoyed only two years dying in  January  He seemed to have a presage of his end for on the day of his death he had invited a number of his friends and neighbors took his leave of them retired to his closet and was found dead in an attitude of devotion  Ibid  His tomb with his figure in brass and that of his wife are still to be seen in the ad∣jacent church  THERE are  CHURCH  besides several other familymonuments Sir  John Fermor  son of  Richard  and  Maud  his wife are represented kneel∣ing at a desk beneath an arch she is dressed in a great ruff and lappets He perhaps out of respect to his father's sufferings in  the cause of the

also improved himself by foreign travel lived at home with vast splendor and hospitality and on  June  his house had the honor of being the place of meeting between  James  I and his queen on her journey from  Scotland  to receive her new crown Here they dined and were entertained with all their trains in a princely manner  Collins  He quitted this life in  SIR  Hatton Fermor  who with nine other gentlemen were knighted at the above interview is also buried here He died of the consequences of a broken leg in He and his lady are very elegant figures placed standing he armed in great boots flapping down vast whiskers peaked beard and what was not in use at the time of his death a cravat It seems the monument was not erected till when his widow  Anna  daughter of Sir  William Cockain  lord mayor of  London  gave this proof of her affec∣tion  She is dressed in a loose gown and with long flowing tresses her hand is on an hourglass his on a scroll between is a bust of a man in long hair above are three most aukward figures of kneeling women I must not quit the lady without saying she suffered with exemplary patience a long imprisonment and great confiscations on account of the loyalty of her family which were rewarded with a peerage in the person of her son Sir  William Fermor  FROM hence I continued my journey southward and much of the way near the borders of  Whittlewood  or  Whittlebury Forest  WHITTLEBURY FOREST  which still continues wooded for several miles in length and of different extents in breadth in a most deep and clayey country Much of the timber is cut in rotation but in parts towards the edge of  Buckinghamshire  are considerable quantities of good oak This forest remained in the crown till the year when  Henry Fitzroy  first duke of  Grafton  was appointed hereditary ranger The present duke hath an elegant house called  Wakefield Lodge  Designed by  W Kent  originally built by Mr  Claypole  soninlaw to  Oliver Cromwell  and ranger of the forest This was one of the five tracts called walks  viz Wakefield Shelbrook Hazelbury Shrob  and  Hanger  Fourteen townships are allowed the right of common in the open coppices and ridings from the principle of justice that some re∣paration might be made to them for the damages sustained by the deer In this great tract here are two lawns  i e  spots in∣closed with pales for pasture for the deer one is  Wakefield Lawn  the other  Sholbrook Lawn  which are secluded from the forest cattle  THAT fierce animal the wild cat is still met with in this forest In the reign of  Richard  I the abbot and convent of  Peterborough  had a charter for hunting in this place the hare the fox and the wild cat which was confirmed to them in by  Henry  III  Morton    By these charters the wild cat should be added to the beasts of forest or of venerie which the book of St  Albans  and old Sir  Tristram  in his  worthie Treatise of Hunting  confined to the hart the hynde the hare the boare and the wolfe the hart and hind being separated because the season of hunting them was diffe∣rent yet they remain in species still the same Beasts of the chace which was an inferior sort of forest were the buck the doe the fox the martion and the roe  Manwood's Forest Laws      THE fondness that seized the regular clergy for the pleasures of the chace did not appear till after the Conquest The  Saxon  clergy were expressly forbidden the amusement King  Edgar  directs the priest  to be neither a hunter nor hawker nor yet a tippler but to keep close to his books as becomes a man of his order  Leges Saxon      THE canon law still preserved its severity and forbad to spi∣ritual persons the amusement of the chace This probably was rather designed to check what might by the excess estrange them from their sacred function The common law from a principle of good sense and humanity permitted the recreation from these ar∣guments that nothing could contribute more effectually to the performance of their duty than good health resulting from fit ex∣ercise as nothing could disqualify them so greatly as the disor∣ders arising from a sedentary life This indulgence probably  soon ended in abuse In the twelfth century we find  Abelard  un∣happy in presiding over a monastery of huntsmen  Chaucer  as I have before quoted flings a fine ridicule on the sporting monk Finally the chace became so necessary an appendage to the ec∣clesiastical state that every see had a number of parks that of  Norwich  thirteen and the sixth mortuary which the king clamed on the death of a prelate was his kennel of hounds  PASS by  Potters Pery  POTTERS PERY  a village which takes its name from the manufacture of coarse ware such as flowerpots  c  which has been long carried on here The clay is yellowish pure

Potters Pery  I quitted it  PASSENHAM  through curiosity of visiting  Passenham  about a mile or two distant on the banks of the  Ouze  near this village  Edward  the Elder encamped here to cover his workmen who were employed in building the walls of  Toucester  Saxon Chr    from being interrupted by the  Danes  A square en∣trenchment is supposed to have been cast up by him and garri∣soned for that purpose  THE church is small  CHURCH  and without ailes dedicated to  Guth∣laius  the saint of the fens It was rebuilt in at the sole ex∣pence of Sir  Robert Banastre  This gentleman was lord of the manor he died in aged about eighty His figure is a half∣length with a book in his hand placed against the wall His epitaph informs us that he was born at  Wem  in  Shropshire  that he was bred at court and served three princes that he had three  wives and by the last an only daughter who conveyed the estate by marriage with  William  lord  Maynard  into that family a younger branch of which possesses it as I apprehend at pre∣sent  I REGAINED the great road and passed through the hamlet of  Old Stratford  seated on rich meadows  OLD STRATFORD  watered by the  Ouze'  which rises in this county not remote from  Brackly  This place is reasonably supposed to have been the  Lactodorum  or  Lactoro∣dum  of the  Itinerary  as the distance suits extremely well and  Roman  coins have been found in the neighboring fields Anti∣quaries derive it from  Llech dwr  and  Llech rhyd  one signifying the stone on the water the other the stone on the ford  See  Gale  and  Burton    a name bestowed on it by the  Britons  probably because the bank of the river was marked by a military stone on this great military way I here cross the river into BUCKINGHAMSHIRE which with  Bedfordshire  and  Hertfordshire  formed the country of the  Catticuchlani  The present name is according to Mr  Camb∣den  taken from the quantity of beeches found in parts of it a word derived from the  Saxon bucken  Two arguments serve to confirm the assertion of  Caesar  that this tree was not found in  Britain  at the time of his invasion one is that the woods of it are merely local and confined to a very few of our southern counties the other is that the  Britons  had no name for it but  what they derived from the  Latin fagus  for they stiled it as we do still  Ffawydden  and  Pren ffawydd  ON crossing the  Ouze  I entered  Stoney Stratford  STONEY STRATFORD  a town built on each side of the  Watlingstreet  It suffered greatly by fire on  May  the th which almost destroyed the whole place but it was soon restored by the vigour of  English  charity One church that of St  Giles  has never been rebuilt the body of the other St  Magdalene  's is restored in a very handsome manner by Mr  Irons  architect in  Warwick  and I suppose enlarged sufficiently to supply the want of the other St  Giles  's had been a chantry valued at £  s    d  a year and was at the time of its ruin a curacy St  Magdalene  's was a chapel belonging to  Wolverton  but now in the presentation of the parishioners  MY journey was continued along the  Street  road to the th stone  BLECHELEY CHURCH  where tempted by the same of certain monuments in  Blecheley  church I digressed about a mile and a quarter to the right I found there a very fine alabaster tomb of  Richard  lord  Grey  of  Wilton  TOMB OF LORD GREY  restored by the celebrated antiquarian  Brown Willis  Esquire who added an inscription and in the front the arms From the former we find that besides  Richard  his son  Reginald  who died

complains that all this was done at the ex∣pence of the convent of St  Albans  and even without its con∣sent  The same  to the great injury of the church In the time of  Henry  VIII  Humphry Boucher  Leland Itin  i    base sunne to the late  Berners  did much coste in translating of the priory into a maner place  i e  converting it into a mansion for himself but left it un∣finished It probably was granted to him but it afterwards was bestowed by  Edward  VI on  George Ferrers  Tanner    At the dissolution it was valued by  Dugdale  at £  s    d  a year by  Speed  at £  s    d  IT appears that these religious were grievously oppressed by a neighboring knight of whom they complained in certain lines too ludicrous to be inserted  See  Weever    Whether they got any redress does not appear  AFTER passing through the village of the same name built on each side of the  Watlingstreet  road I entered the county of HERTFORD and near the twentyeighth milestone leave on the right  Flam∣sted  FLAMSTED  where stood a small priory of  Benedictine  nuns founded in the time of king  Stephen  by  Roger de Tonei  The manor had been granted by the Conqueror to  Ralph de Tonei  His predecessor was a  Saxon  knight called  Thurnoth  who with the true spirit of the times engaged with thirteen soldiers  Waldef  and  Thurman  to protect all passengers from the thieves and wild beasts which then infested the road and in time of war to protect the church of St  Albans  with all their might  Leofftan  abbot of that convent in the time of the Confessor facilitated the undertaking by cut∣ting down the great woods on the side of the  Watlingstreet  which gave shelter to robbers He bestowed on  Thurnoth  this manor who in return presented  Leofftan  with five ounces of gold and a fair palfrey  Thurnoth  at the Conquest resisted the power of the  Norman  invader who bestowed it on  de Tonei  who directed that the same services should be strictly performed to the abbey  Chauncy  who by mistake calls this  De Tonei Roger  but in page gives him his right name    ABOUT three miles further go through  Redburn  a small town  REDBURN  built like the former on each side of the antient road At this place was discovered the bones of St  Amphibalus  the noble  Bri∣ton  who lodging at the house of St  Alban  at  Verulam  proved the means of his conversion In the  Dioclesian  persecution he was diligently sought after but St  Alban  generously determined not to give up his guest promoted his escape by putting on his pre∣ceptor's cloak and suffering himself to be seized by the soldiers in his stead  Bede de Br Eccl      Amphibalus  for a time evaded their fury but was at length seized and underwent a most cruel death  Weever's Fun Mon    on the spot on which his pious convert was martyred The Christians stole the body and gave it a private interment at this place In the reliques were removed to St  Albans  enshrined near those of his fellowsufferer and a prior and three monks with  s  a year were appointed guardians of the sacred deposit I am sorry to find that after all the very existence of this Saint is doubted for there are some who believe that the Saint was no more than an  amphibalus  a long cloak which St  Alban  be∣fore he went to execution threw about him which being at length personified was canonized and received into the Ka∣lendar  Usher de Br Eccl      A CELL consisting of a prior and a few  Benedictines  from St  Albans  was placed here It was dedicated to St  Amphibalus  and his companions and was inhabited before After the dissolution it was with the manor granted to  John Cork  Tanner      THE present great road a little beyond this place quits the  Watlingstreet  which runs direct on the right to  Verulanium  The former can boast of no great extent of view but is bounded by  beautiful risings varied with woods and inclosures dressed with a gardenlike elegance The common soil is almost covered with flints the stratum beneath is chalk which is used for a manure  CHALK  Pliny  describes this  British  earth under the title of  Creta argenta∣ria  and adds  petitur ex alto in centenos pedes actis puteis ore angusta∣tis intus ut in metallis spatiante vena hac maxime  Britannia  uti∣tur  Lib xvii c  This very method is used in the county at present The farmer sinks a pit and in the terms of a miner drives out on all sides leaving a sufficient roof and draws up the chalk in buckets through a narrow mouth  Pliny  informs us in his remarks on the  British  marls then that they will last eighty years and that there is not an example of any person being obliged to marl his land twice in his life  The same  An experienced farmer whom I met with in  Hertfordshire  assured me that he had about thirty years before made use of this manure on a field of his and that should he live to the period mentioned by the  Roman  naturalist he thought he should not have occasion of a repetition  THIS bottom is watered by the small stream of the  Verlume Ver  or  Mure  which rises at  Rowbeach  beyond  Marketstreet  flows by  Flamsted Redburn  and St  Albans  and loses itself and name in the  Coln  a little N E of  Colneystreet

Filled with familypride he was sent to the Tower for a contempt shewn in the house to a nobleman less highly born than himself yet on the breaking out of the troubles of his royal master  Charles  I he shewed a great want of true spirit consulting his own safety and ease rather than to risque them by siding with either party He quitted  England  for which as lord  Clarendon  says he had little other affection than as he had a great share in it in which like a great leviathan he might sport himself He was a man of a noble presence and affected a plain garb He accordingly is here dressed in a

dressed in black a turn∣over and with short hair He was born at  Kipplin  in  Yorkshire  was educated at  Oxford  and received his first preferment which was in the law line in  Ireland  His political abilities occasioned his being taken notice of by Sir  Robert Cecil  Mr  Calvert  was first his clerk and after knighthood promoted to be one of the secretaries of state and was in great confidence with his master  GEORGE CALVERT  the First Lord Baltimore  James  I He thought fit to change his religion which he inge∣nuously avowed The king pleased with his sincerity continued him of his privy council and even created him lord  Baltimore  of the kingdom of  Ireland  and made him large grants in that king∣dom a proof that the perversion of his subjects was far from exciting his displeasure He also obtained a grant of a part of  Newfoundland  which he called  Avalon  after  Old Avalon  the site of  Glastonbury  abbey where as is said Christianity was first planted in  Britain  He was constituted absolute lord and pro∣prietor with the royalties of a county palatine except the sove∣reign dominion and allegiance with a fifth part of the gold and silver reserved to the crown After the king's death he twice visited the place built a fair house there and when his settle∣ment was molested by the  French  he fitted out two ships at his own expence and drove them away At length on a repetition of their insults was obliged to abandon the island  Charles  I to make him amends gave him a new grant of the country on the north side of  Chesapeak Bay  to hold in common socage as of the

cloaks above cassocks lay above clergymen  Worthies of Surrey      He was upright and firm in his princi∣ples probably too favorable to the tenets which under him acquired strength in the following reign to subvert both church and state with the assistance of the contrary conduct of the indis∣creet and furious  Land  How difficult is the virtue of modera∣tion  Abbot  gloriously resisted the licensing of a slavish sermon preached by doctor  Sibthorp  and fell into disgrace his office was suspended nor was it taken off till the rising strength of the puritanical party made the compliance with the times pru∣dent His manners had in them an uncourtly stiffness and mo∣roseness  Clarendon  He found he was restored more through policy than affection As he attained to the age of seventyone I can scarcely think that grief either on account of his suspension or unconquerable sorrow for the sad accident of killing a game∣keeper with a crossbow in shooting at a deer  Illustr Heads  i  brought

presumption to make his addresses to the queen  Anne  of  Austria  Clarendon  i  On receiving the treatment which his vanity merited he not only in revenge involved his country in war but endeavoured to alienate the affection of his master  Charles  from his spouse her lovely sisterinlaw  Henrietta Maria  I ought to have mentioned the common report that his ill success with the wife of  Olivarez  the  Spanish  minister and a cruel deception in consequence  Granger  i note  was the primary cause of the breach of the  Spanish  match and the hazard his young prince ran in escaping from an incensed court He fell at length by the hands of the melan∣choly  Felton  who taught by the murmurs of the people thought he did an acceptable service by freeing his country from so dis∣tasteful a minister  SIR  Richard Weston  earl of  Portland  appears drest in black  SIR RICHARD WESTON EARL OF PORTLAND  with a ruff blue riband and white rod his hair and beard grey This nobleman is a proof how honors change manners He set out with a great character for prudence spirit and abilities and discharged his duty as ambassador and on his return as chancel∣lor of the exchequer with much credit Under the ministry of the duke of  Buckingham  he was appointed lord treasurer on which he suddenly became so elated that he lost all dispo∣sition to please and soon after the duke's death became his suc∣cessor in the public hatred without succeeding him in his credit at court  Clarendon  i  His lust after power and his rapacity to raise a great  fortune were unmeasurable yet the jealousy of his temper frus∣trated the one and the greatness of his expences the other His imperious nature led him to give frequent offence yet his timi∣dity obliged him to make humiliating concessions to the very people he had offended He had a strange curiosity to learn what the persons injured said of him the knowlege of which always brought on fresh troubles as he would expostulate with them for their severe sayings as if he had never given cause for them by which he would often discover the mean informant of his fruitless intelligence He died in  March  in universal dis∣esteem and the family and fortune for which he labored so greatly were extinct early in the next reign  Thomas Wentworth  earl of  Strafford  THOMAS EARL OF STRAFFORD  in armour Like  Bucking∣ham  a victim also to the popular

king alleging that they having been coun∣sellors to his majesty and concurring in the advice of the several measures now imputed as crimes they alone were guilty in  the eye of the law and ought to expiate the supposed offences of majesty He survived to see the restoration of the royal family was rewarded with the treasurer's rod and died a friend to his country as well as prince on  May  th His death and the fall of chancellor  Hyde  removed from the abandoned court every check upon its profligate designs It was so impatient to remove him as to wish to wrest the rod from his dying hands had

was attained by a ten years service in the  Low Countries  On the breaking out of the civil wars his principles led him to embrace the royal party after serving for some time against the rebels in  Ireland  In his first  campaign he was taken prisoner at  Namptwich  and imprisoned for some years with such severity that he was at last induced for the sake of obtaining liberty to engage with the parlement Per∣haps by stipulation he never served the remainder of the war in  England  Clarendon  Ireland  was the scene of his exploits and afterwards  Scotland  which he entirely reduced He was justly loaden with honors by his restored prince under whom by indulg∣ing his spirit of frugality he amassed a vast fortune His great military abilities fitted him equally for sea or land He commanded jointly with prince  Rupert  the fleet against the  Dutch  in the dreadful engagement of His success was equal to his valour He became the darling of the sailors who called him by the familiar

merited  LORD keeper  Coventry  in his robes  LORD KEEPER COVENTRY  and a ruff with his hands on the seals his look remarkably pleasing a mark of the inter∣nal comfort he felt in a life passed in the

concludes the list of portraits in the noble gallery of  Gorhambury  scattered over the house are a few others which merit mention as persons eminent in their generation Among them is one which ought properly to have led the van the head of  Sir Nicholas Bacon  his dress a furred robe  SIR NICHOLAS BACON  He was a per∣son of a very corpulent habit for which reason queen  Elizabeth  used to say "that her lord keeper's soul lodged well" To what I have given of him before I shall only add that he caught his death by sleeping in his chair with a window open He awoke disordered and reproving his servant for his negligence was told that he feared to wake him "Then" replies the keeper "your complaisance will cost me my life" He died in  ANOTHER head of his second wife in a close cap and white gown  HIS SECOND WIFE  worked with oakleaves and acorns This distinguished lady was  Anne  daughter of Sir  Anthony Cook  of  Giddyhall  in  Essex  She had great abilities natural and acquired and was  eminently skilled in  Greek Latin  and  Italian  She had the ho∣nor of being appointed governess to  Edward  VI  Chauncy  i  Hertfordsh    To her in¦structions was probably owing the surprizing knowlege of the excellent young prince She shared his education with her fa∣ther doctor  Cox  and Sir  John Cheek  Complete Hist Engl  ii  Her sons  Anthony  and  Francis  were not a little indebted for the reputation they ac∣quired to the pains taken with them by this excellent woman in their tender years  Br Biegr  i  When they grew up they found in her a severe but admirable monitor She translated from the  Italian  the sermons of  Barnardine Ochine  and from the  Latin Jewel's Apology for the Church of England  both which met with the highest applause She died in the beginning of the reign of  James  I and was buried in the neighboring church of Saint  Michael  Ballard's Br Ladies      A BEAUTIFUL picture of lady  Margaret Russel  COUNTESS OF CUMBERLAND  daughter to  Francis  earl of  Bedford  and wife to  George  earl of  Cumberland  and mother to the celebrated  Anne Clifford  a lady happier in the filial affections of her daughter than the conjugal tenderness of her husband who taken up with military glory and the pomps of tilts and tournaments paid little attention to domestic duties In her diary which is preserved in manuscript I find she suffered even to poverty and complains of her ill usage in a most suppliant and pathetic manner Her lord felt heavy com∣punction on his deathbed I cannot help relating two of the  minutiae  of her journal She relates that  Anne Clifford  was begot on her the first of  May  in  Channelrow House  hard by the  MARGARET COUNTESS OF CUMBERLAND  river  Thames  and in  Skipton Castle  on  Bardon  tower she felt a child

time of  Charles  I in his robes distinguished for his knowlege of the laws He was one of the judges who had the honor of deciding against the illegality of shipmoney yet still on account of his eminent qualities preserved the favor of the court When sunk in years and petitioning for a retreat the king granted his request and rewarded his services with the sees and honor of chief justice during life  Lloyd  ii    Mundum vicit et de∣seruit  says his epitaph  aet    Anno  R C  Anno Domini    HIS lady is in black with a lawn ruff her portrait is dated  HIS LADY  Lady  Croke  should by no means be passed unnoticed especially as  Whitelock  Memorials    gives her the chief merit in her hus∣band's decision in the case of shipmoney He had it seems re∣solved on the contrary side but appearing wavering was told by his wife  that she hoped he would do nothing against his con∣science for fear of any danger or prejudice to him or his fa∣mily and that she would be contented to suffer want or any misery with him rather than be an occasion for him to do or say any thing against his judgment or conscience  I SHALL conclude with a very singular portrait on wood  PHILIP LE BON DUKE OF BURGUNDY  called  Sylvester de Grimston  a noble  Norman  standardbearer to the Con∣queror at the battle of  Hastings  and afterwards his chamberlain He held lands in  Yorkshire  of the lord  Roos  among others that of  Grimston  in  Holderness  from whence he took the name The picture is antient and curious but wants four centuries of the great period in which  Sylvester  lived neither did that age afford any artists that could give even a tolerable representation of the human figure much less convey down a likeness of the fierce heroes of their times I premise this to shew the impossibility of this portrait having been a copy of some original of this great ancestor The dress is singular a large bonnet with a very long silken appendage a green jacket hanging sleeves a collar of SS held in one hand his face beardless On the back of the picture is  Petrus  xoi  me fecit anno  The artist is unknown to me but the habit of the person is that of the date for I find in  Monfaucon's Monarchie Francoise  several persons of rank in the dress particularly  Philip Le Bon  duke of  Burgundy  between whom and this portrait there is so strong a resemblance of fea∣ture  See the book cited vol iii p tab xlix fig  that I do not hesitate to imagine that the  Gorhambury  portrait is no other than one of this illustrious prince He was born in died in so that he was a youth when the picture was taken  I NOW resume my journey and in my way to St  Albans  about a mile and a half distant pass by the site of St  Mary de la Pre de Pratis  or the Meadows an hospital for leprous women founded  about by  Warine  abbot of  St Alban's  It afterwards rose to a priory of  Benedictine  nuns but fell in when  Wolsey  commendatory abbot obtained from  Clement  VIII a bull for its suppression and for annexing it to the abbey after which he got a grant of it for himself from the king who on the ruin of the cardinal gave it to Sir  Ralph Rowlet  Tanner      IMMEDIATELY after quitting this place  VERULAMIUM  I entered the celebrated  Verulamium  at a spot distinguished by a great fragment of the antient wall known by the name of  Gorhamburyblock  which pro∣bably bounded one side of one of the  portae  or entrances being exactly opposite to that on the eastern part The precinct de∣parts from the rectangular form of the  Romans  this being among those which were laid out  Prout loci qualitas aut necessitas postula∣verit  Vegetius  lib i c  It inclines to an oval shape is placed on a slope and the lower side bounded by the river  Ver  which in former times might have spread into a lake and given greater security to the town According to  Humphry Lloyd  Commentariol    it gave also the name to the place  Gwerllan  or the temple on the  Ver  rightly bestowing on the  Britons  a preoccupancy of it to the  Romans  I shall not dispute the notions of the particular ford over which  Cesar  crossed the  Thames  when he penetrated into our island It probably was at or near  Coway Stakes Cesar  leaves us no room to depart from that opinion as he expressly tells us that he led his army to the river  Thames  towards the borders of the territories of  Cassive∣launus  Caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen  Tama  in  in finos  Cassivelauni  exe  ∣citum duxit  Bel Gal  lib v  Preceding this he speaks of the  fines Cassivelauni  as being a  mari circiter  ∣lia passaum  lxxx    the goldenlocked leader of the country of the  Cassi  and these  Cassi  are reasonably supposed to have been a clan of the  Cattieuchlani  and to have inhabited the hundred of this county now called  Cashio  in which  Verulamium  stood But I must con∣tend that the distance of that city is far too remote from the fordable parts of the  Thames  to admit it to have been the town of the  British  leader destroyed by the invader It lies in the nearest line thirtyseven miles from those parts of the river a distance too great for the time given to  Cesar  for his second cam∣paign in  Britain  The town or rather post which was forced by him was not remote from the camp occupied by him on the side of the river and most likely was that which is still very entire in the park of her Grace the dutchess dowager of  Portland  at  Bulstrode  about fifteen miles distance from the  Roman  camp whose vestiges are still to be seen not far from the famous ford  Sylves Paludibusque munitum  Partly by length of time partly by constant cultivation this post has lost some of the characters ascribed by  Cesar  to the town of  Cassivelaunus  for it wants at present the marshy defence it had in his days  THE town alluded to was within the territories of the  British  chieftain and one of the strong holds into which the  Britons  were used to drive their cattle in time of danger This by  Cesar  's ac∣count was certainly not the most capital for his first relation in∣forms  us it only contained  saits numerus pecorum  a pretty consi∣derable number of cattle Notwithstanding his vanity a few lines lower swells his booty into  magnus numerus  a vast number  Le  vis Hist Br    Near  Shepperton  also near that place in a field called  War Close  are found spurs swords bones and other marks of a battle See  Cambden  i but in all likelihood the first is the nearest to the truth  erulamium  was the capital of this country and the residence of its princes I do not reckon  Cassivelaunus  among them he was a chieftain of the  Cassi  and for his great abilities elected general on the  Roman  invasion if our  British  history is to be trusted He was a guardian to his nephews  Anarwy  and  Tenafan  Stukely Itin  i  the last father to  Cunoboline  whose coins are so frequent Here was one of the  British  mints for we find the word  Ver  on the coins but no prince's name to distinguish the reign  After the  Romans  had effected their conquest they added walls to the ordinary  British  defence of ramparts and ditches Many great fragments of the former still remain proofs of the strength and manner of the  Roman  masonry On the one side is a vast foss on another two The walls are twelve feet thick where entire  WALLS  formed of flints bedded in mortar now grown into amazing hardness By intervals of about three feet distance are three and in some places four rows of broad and thin bricks or tiles which were continued the whole length of the walls which seem designed as foundations to sustain the layers of flints and lime while the last was in a moist state There were besides round  holes which penetrated quite through  See Doctor  Stukely  's admirable plan of this place  but these are either filled up or escaped my notice According to Doctor  Stukely  's measurement the area is five thousand two hundred feet in length and the greatest breadth about three thousand It is at present inclosed into fields but under the hedges in many places are vestiges of buildings and as I am told when it is under tillage the sites of the streets appear by the different color of the corn above them The  Watlingstreet  comes to the  Porta Decumana  the gate on the western side and passes quite through the city There is another road goes on the outside of the south side a small military way like that which passed from turret to turret on  Severus  's wall  Tour Scotl  part ii p  for the conveni∣ency of external passengers  THIS place by its attachment to the conquerors acquired the privileges of a free borough  A MUNICIPIUM  a  municipium  or municipal city whose inhabitants enjoyed all the rights of the  Roman  citizens for which reason such towns derive their name  a muneribus capiendis  their power to bear public offices They had their senators knights and commons magistrates and priests censors ediles questors and flamens  THE attachment of this town to its new masters proved the cause of a heavy misfortune which befel it under the reign of  Nero Boadicea  SACKED BY BOADICEA  widow of  Prasutagus  king of the  Iceni  enraged at the cruel

Londinium  and  Verolamium  suffered from the fury of the  Britons  and seventy thousand citizens and allies fell by the edge of the sword This city was remarkable for its wealth  Taciti Annal  lib xiv c  c  which was another incentive for the  Britons  to attack it added to a particular animosity against a people who had forsaken the cus∣toms and religion of their ancestors  THE place in a short time emerged from its misfortune and had the honor of producing  Albanus  OF ST ALBANUS  the protomartyr of  Britain  a wealthy citizen of  Verulamium  and by privilege of  Rome  also He had been a  Pagan  but was converted by means of a guest whom he had sheltered during the great persecution of  Dioclesian  as I have before related St  Alban  suffered in the year Let not legend destroy the credibility of the martyrdom by assigning attendant miracles long after their cessation We are told that after he had refused to sacrifice to the heathen gods the usual test of the alleged crime of Christianity he was as customary whipped with rods and then led to execution and beheaded on  Holmhurst  where the town of  St Alban's  at present stands In his passage the torrent which then divided the place from  Ve∣rulamium  like the Redsea divided its waters and gave dry passage to the Saint and his followers a fountain sprung up where the martyr kneeled one of the executioners relenting was con∣verted and suffered with  Albanus  another who performed the deed lost his eyes as a penalty for his cruelty for they dropped out of his head in the moment in which he gave the blow  Bede Hist Eccl  lib i c Father  Cressy  in his  Church History  lib vi has given a much longer detail  ▪  St  Alban  was interred on the spot and his remains were mira∣culously discovered several centuries after their interment  IN  SYNOD HOLD HERE  this place was honored with a synod in which St  Germanus  and  Lupus  two  French  prelates assisted A chapel was erected about the year by abbot  Ulsin  in honor of the former on the spot in which he preached whose ruins were to be seen the beginning of this century  AFTER the  Saxon  invasion the name of the town was changed for that of  Verlamcester  and  Watlincester  The  British  hero  Uther Pendragon  after a long siege wrested it out of the hands of the  Saxons  and held it during his life after which they soon reco∣vered it but by reason of the cruel wars that raged during the contest between them and the  Britons  the place became totally desolated  LIKE the antient  Deva  Tour in Wales  p  Verulamium  had its great vaults  GREAT VAULTS  or subterraneous retreats strongly and artfully arched These are supposed by Sir  Henry Chauncy  to have been designed as places of retreat in time of war for the women and children and for the concealing of the most valuable effects In they were found to give shelter to thieves and prostitutes which caused  Eldred  the eighth abbot to search after these sousterrains and found se∣veral ways and passages all which he caused to be destroyed but preserved the tiles and stones for the rebuilding the church then in ruins  Chauncy      THE present  St Alban's  arose from the

residence of the  Saxon  princes who by their frequent visits to the abbey of  St Alban's  became an insupportable burden to its revenues At length abbot  Alfric  by his interest with king  Ethelred  II prevaled on him to dispose of it the king only reserving a small fortress in the neighbor∣hood of the monastery  Chauncy    This also continuing to give offence to its pious neighbors was destroyed

grateful monks to conceal the infamy of their benefactor call down a vision from heaven as a motive to his piety But  Offa  did not trust to this solely he made a penitential pilgrimage to  Rome  and by the merit of his monastic institution at  St Alban's  readily obtained absolution  ITS GREAT PRIVILEGE  and not only procured for the house exemption from the tax of  Peterpence  but power to collect the same for its own use through the whole province of  Hertford  a privilege which no per∣son in the realm the king himself not excepted ever enjoyed By the same bull his holiness granted that the abbot or monk whom he appointed archdeacon should have pontifical jurisdiction over the priests and laymen of the possessions of this church and that no person whatsoever save the Pope himself should offer to inter∣fere It was by the charter of the king to be free from all taxes repair of bridges and castles and free from making entrenchments against an enemy to be exempt from episcopal jurisdiction and that the fines for crimes which belonged to the king should be given for ever to this monastery  Offa  not content with this inclosed the body of the Saint in a shrine of

even as small as five pounds a year  Willis  i  The house and the greatest part of the lands were granted to  Richard Lee  captain of the band of pensioners as scandal reports in re∣ward for his prudence in winking at the king's affection for his handsome wife  Stevens  i  The town or as  Willis  says the abbot pur∣chased the church from the king for £ and by that means preserved it from destruction which gave him so much merit with queen  Mary  that when she determined to restore the abbey she appointed him to preside over it  Willis  i  It is said that he died of a broken heart within a few days after he received the news of her death  THE revenues at the dissolution were valued by  Dugdale  at £  s    d per annum  REVENUES  by  Speed  at £  s    d  Tanner    Notwithstanding the purchase made by  Boreman  GRANTED TO THE TOWN  Edward  VI granted the monastery to the corporation of  St Alban's  which he had lately instituted and ordered that the church should  be reputed the parish church of the place and be served by a rector to be nominated by the mayor and burgesses of the town  THE abbots lived in splendor suitable to their rank and reve∣nues They dined in the great hall at a table to which there was a flight of fifteen steps The monks served up the dinner in plate and in their way made a halt at every fifth step where there was a landing and sung on each a short hymn The abbot usually sat alone in the middle of the table and when any per∣sons of rank came he sat towards the end of the table After the monks had waited some time on the abbot they sat down at two other tables placed on the sides of the hall and had their ser∣vices brought in by the novices who when the monks had dined sat down to their own dinners  Antiquarian Repertory  iii    THE

eighty The height of the tower one hundred and fortyfour feet that of the body sixtyfive of the ailes thirty the breadth of the body two hundred and seventeen  BY neglect  RUINED  or by the ravages of war the original church fell to decay Abbot  Ealdred  who lived in designed to pull down and rebuild it and for that purpose collected from the ruins of  Verulamium  all the stone tiles and timber he could find Death put a stop to his intention His successor  Eadmer  re∣sumed the task of getting together the materials and in his  search found great quantities of curious antiquities such as altars urns  c  which the pious man broke to pieces as hea∣then abominations He also as is said discovered several books some in  British  others in  Latin  and a great one in a language and character unknown to any but an old priest This was found to be the authentic life of St  Alban  which was carefully trea∣sured up being a confirmation of what  Bede  had wrote on the same subject The other books being only accounts of heathen mythology inventions of the devil were instantly condemned to the flames  Stevens  i    A FAMINE stopped the design of the new church under the abbot  Leofric  The troubles that ensued under the remaining  Saxon  monarchs and the unsettled state of the kingdom at the Conquest occasioned the plan to lie dormant till the year when it was executed by abbot  Paul  a  Norman  monk He ap∣plied to that purpose the timber  AND REBUILT  the stones and tiles collected by his predecessors  Ex lapidibus et tegulis veleris civitatis  Verolamii  et materie lignea quam

other parts afterwards were pulled down  ALTERATIONS  and rebuilt in the stile of the times and I suspect that in general the pre∣sent windows are long posterior to those coeval with the walls being painted and of a taste of another age The windows in the great tower and perhaps the range along the nave are of time intervening for they differ from the mode of each of the  others I find this confirmed in the lives of the abbots  John  first of the name who died in pulled down the front∣wall which was built of old tiles so strongly cemented with mor∣tar that it proved a work of great labor Master  Hugh Goldcliff  a most excellent workman was employed who consulting more the ornaments of sculpture of images and flowers neglected the security of his building so that it fell down and was left un∣finished during the life of this good abbot  Mat Paris    His successor  Wil∣liam  of  Trampington  had the honor of completing his design He not only rebuilt that front but made new windows and put glass into them so as to give more light to the church He also raised the steeple much higher covered it with lead and died full of good works in  The same    IN the abbacy of  John  of  Whethamstead  this church received the most considerable alterations To avoid prolixity I omit the nu∣merous works of that most munificent abbot I shall only note the change he made in the exterior part by enlarging and glazing the windows on the north side of the church which was before dark and by causing a large window to be made at the west end of the north a  e which was as destitute of light as the other part  Stevens  i    John  died in before which time the narrow win∣dows had been changed for those more expanded lightsome and less painted  IT is in the inside only that any part

effected the ruin of his dutchess by a ridiculous charge of witchcraft and after that brought as groundless a charge of treason against him∣self He was conveyed to St  Edmund's Bury  where a parlement was convened in before which the accusation was to be made His enemies fearing the public execution of so great and so beloved a character caused him to be stifled in his bed and then pretended that

About the year it was so increased that king  Ethelred  at the intercession of abbot  Ulfin  gave it a grant of a market and the rank of a borough In the  Doomsday Book  it appears at the Conquest to have been rated for ten hides The  arable was sixteen ploughlands In demesne three hides two ploughlands and another may be made There were four aliens sixteen villeyns and thirteen boors having thirteen ploughlands fortysix burgesses the toll and other rents of the town eleven pounds fourteen shillings a year three mills forty shillings a year meadow two ploughlands in quantity wood to feed a thousand hogs in pannagetime and seven shillings rent The total twenty pounds at that time in that of  Edward  the Confessor twentyfour There are now twelve cottagers a park of deer and a fishpond  THE town was always considered as part of the demesne of the abbey and at the Conquest it was part of its possessions  Richard  I by charter confirmed it to them with a market and all the liberty attending a borough the abbot holding as he al∣leged of the king  in capite  and holding the burgesses as de∣mesned men of the abbey This tenure the burgesses wished to force from him which they attempted by the following stratagem In the thirtyfifth of  Edward  I they had sent representatives to parlement and also in the first and second of  Edward  II but in the fifth of the same reign the sheriff of  Hertfordshire  by the con∣trivance of the abbot to save the expence had omitted the usual summons This the burgesses complained of asserting that they held of the king hoping thereby to get released of the services they owed their lord abbot or if they succeeded in sending members to be freed of those which they owed the king Both of which expectations in the opinion of Mr  Madox  were ill∣founded  Antiquities of the Exchequer  i  Burgesses were returned to parlement the fifth of  Edward  II and in the second fourth and fifth of  Edward  III after which the load or the privilege as it was respectively thought by the disputants ceased At the time of the dissolu∣tion the town with the other possessions of the abbey fell to the king  Henry  VIII and from him to his heir  Edward  VI who by letters patent dated  May  th  INCORPARATED  made the town of  St Alban's  a body corporate by the name of the mayor and bur∣gesses and granted to the said mayor and burgesses and their successors the said profits and other franchises they to hold the premises in free burgage and to render yearly to the crown XL as a feefarm at the feast of St  Michael  Madox  i    THESE were changed by  Charles  II into a mayor recorder twelve aldermen and twentyfour assistants The members are returned by the inhabitants and freemen about a thousand in number and the returningofficer is the mayor  Willis Notit Parl  iii    THE remarkable events which befel this town in earlier times were as usual of the sanguinary kind During the rage of the barons wars in the reign of  Henry  III the burgesses fortified the place and defended it with strong gates well secured They were particularly jealous of horsemen therefore refused passage to all cavaliers The constable of  Hertford  displeased at this prohibition in a bravado boasted that he would enter the town with three youths knights and four of his best villeins He did so and walking up and down with great insolence asked his companions which way the wind was The townsmen alarmed at the question thought he designed to fire their houses In a sum∣mary way they executed justice by knocking down and beheading him his youths and villeins placing their heads on poles at the corners of their streets The king resented this invasion of his prerogative and fined the town in a hundred marks which was immediately paid  Chauney      IN the reign of  Richard  II they underwent a mortification of a far heavier nature In after the bloody insurrection of  Wat Tyler  a court of justice was held here by the famous Sir  Robert Tresilian John Ball  a priest of  Coventry  was tried and executed Several of the inhabitants had favored the rebels or taking advantage of the turbulence of the  mes had de∣manded  from the abbot a release from all their services Several of them were condemned and put to death and orders given that their bodies should remain on the gallows  in terrorem  The bur∣gesses in contempt of the king took them down but when a discovery was made  Richard  in a rage commanded the towns∣men to make chains and hang the putrid carcases on the same places they took them from which disgusting and horrible as the task was they were obliged to perform  Holinshed      IN the civil wars between the houses of  York  and  Lancaster  FIRST BATTLE AT ST ALBAN'S  this town was the scene of dreadful carnage Here was shed the first blood in that fatal quarrel As soon as ever the weak  Henry  or rather his queen and ministers found themselves free from the power of his rival the duke of  York  they armed their forces and marched from  London  to  St Alban  's to meet their enemy who was advancing towards them with a mighty host They met on the d of  May  The peaceful prince sent out a herald to  York  strictly commanding him to keep the peace as became a dutiful subject and to avoid effusion of blood  York  's answer was humble yet resolute demanding the duke of  Somerset  and other delinquents to be delivered into his hands that justice might be executed on them for the miseries they had brought on the realm  Somerset  who had been regent of  France  was charged in particular with the loss of  Normandy  The king determined to stand the event of the day rather than give up his friends His banner was placed in St  Peter's street  Orders were issued by  Henry  but most probably by the bloody  Margaret  that no quar∣ter  Stow    should be given to his opponents The  Yorkists  began the attack in three places The famous  John  lord  Clifford  defended the barriers with his accustomed valour The kingmaking  Warwick  who at this time espoused the cause of  York  collected his force and broke in through the gardens into  Holywellstreet  Stow    his soldiers shouted his tremendous name The duke of  York  entered at the same time and a dreadful fight ensued Victory declared in his favor Numbers of the nobility and gentry with about eight hundred common men fell on the side of  Henry  the valiant  Clifford  usually called  The Old  though only forty years of age the earl of  Northumberland  son to the noted  Hotspur  and the great duke of  Somerset  were slain The last lost his life be∣neath the sign of the  Castle  to fulfil the prophecy thus delivered by  Shakespeare  Let him shun castles  Safer shall he be on the sandy plains  Than where castles mounted stand  Henry  VI part ii act  Hulle's Chronicle  lxxxvi    Numbers of the nobility were wounded and numbers fled till the fury of the battle was over None were executed by the vic∣tor the barbarity of civil feuds had not yet taken place pro∣voked by the reciprocal cruelties which speedily followed  Henry  wounded in the neck by an arrow which hurtled in showers on him retreated to a poor cottage where he was found by the conquerors They asked forgiveness on their knees which the humane prince readily gave on condition they would stop  the carnage He became their prisoner and they of course be∣came governors of the kingdom The abbey escaped plunder for fortunately the king did not make it his headquarters  THE king from this time to the year remained a mere shadow of royalty entirely under the directions of the  Yorkists  His queen was driven from him under the terror of a proscription That spirited woman did not employ her time in prayers or counting her beads like her weak husband but by the assistance of her northern friends raised a potent army fought and slew the duke of  York  at the battle of  Wakefield  on  December  th and marching towards  London  gave occasion to a second battle at  St Alban's  THE earl of  Warwick  SECOND BATTLE AT ST ALBAN'S  now in possession of the king hastened from  London  with the captive monarch and took post in  St Alban's Margaret  attempting to pass through the town was re∣pulsed by a storm of arrows directed from the marketplace but she quickly forced her way through a lane into St  Peter's street  The conflict became then very bloody and after great slaughter both parties quitted the town and continued the battle with the animosity usual in civil feuds on  Bernard Heath  north of  St Alban's  as far as the village of  Sauntbridge  and even beyond it at a place called  No Man's Land  Stow    There a  corps de reserve  of  Warwick  's army to the number of four or five thousand made so vigorous an onset on the  Lancastrians  as to render the victory for some time doubtful At length the treachery or cowardice of a captain  Lovelace  who commanded the  Kentishmen  determined the  day he quitted the field and left a complete victory to the queen The confederated lords fled and left the king in com∣pany of Lord  Bonvil  and Sir  Thomas Kiriel  a gallant knight of  Kent  both  Yorkists  These gentlemen  Henry  had prevaled on to stay with him assuring them of pardon and security but his barbarous queen in contempt of the royal word and in defiance of all good faith caused them to be beheaded in presence of her son  Edward  Halle  p c  as it were to familiarize the young prince with blood and train him to cruelty  THREEANDTWENTY hundred men perished in this battle Only one man of rank was slain Sir  John Grey  of  Groby  who had that morning with twelve others been knighted by the king at  Colney  His widow became queen to  Edward  IV and occasioned fresh calamities to the kingdom and proved the in∣nocent cause of the destruction of her kindred  ON quitting  St Alban's  I passed by the long wall which in∣closed the nunnery of  Sopewell  SOPEWELL  made of stone mixed

field of  Barnet  marked by a column that shews the spot where the decisive battle was fought between the houses of  York  and  Lancaster  which fixed the crown on the head of  Edward  IV  THE great earl of  Warwick  resentful of the injuries he had re∣ceived of that prince deposed him from the throne he had enabled him to mount So popular was the character of this po∣tent baron that a numerous army flew to his standard every one was proud of bearing his cognisance the bear and ragged staff in his cap some of gold enamelled others of silver and those who could not afford the precious metals cut them out of white silk or cloth When he visited  London  in peaceful times he came attended by six hundred men in red jackets embroidered  with ragged staves before and behind He kept house at his pa∣lace in  WarwickLane  Six oxen were consumed at every break∣fast and every tavern was full of his meat and every guest was allowed to carry off as much roasted or boiled as he could bear upon his long dagger  Stow's Hist London  edit p    Edward  on his return to  England  was joyfully received in  London  Hearing that  Warwick  was on his march towards the capital he hastened to meet him and posted himself at  Barnet  So bad was the intelligence in those days that  Edward  advanced in the night so near to  Warwick  's camp that the earl unapprized of his vicinity kept firing his ordnance over that of the king the greatest part of the night without the lest execution On the morning being that of  Easterday April  th both the lead∣ers placed their armies in order  Warwick  wore as his

a thick mist with that deadly hate which the long series of civil wars had created The battle raged with various success as might be expected from the undaunted courage and animosity of the leaders and from the reflection on the certain destruction consequential of defeat They fought obscured in fog till ten o'clock victory seemed to incline to  Warwick  when his people mistaking the stars in the helms of  Oxford  's soldiers for the suns of  Edward  's party charged their own friends who crying Treason Treason fled with eight hundred men The mar∣quis of  Montacute  with the fickleness usual in those times had privily agreed with  Edward  to desert his brother  War∣wick  and had changed his livery This was discovered by some of the earl's men who instantly put him to death a fit reward of fraternal perfidy  Warwick  seeing his brother slain  Oxford  fled and the fortune of the day turned against him leaped on a horse in hopes of escaping but coming to an im∣passable wood was there killed and stripped naked and after being exposed with the body of  Montacute  for three or four days in the church of St  Paul  's was interred in the abbey of  Bisham  in  Berkshire  founded by the  Montacutes  his maternal ancestors About four thousand were slain on both sides who were interred for the most part on the spot  Edward  built here a chapel and according to the custom of the times appointed a priest to say mass for the souls of the deceased This place in the days of  Stow  Annals    was converted into a dwellinghouse The following conversation relative to this battle

of the place Here had been in early times a hermitage which  Geffry de Magnaville  about the year bestowed on his new∣founded abbey of  Walden  in  Essex  Newcourt's Repertorium  i  The church was probaby a chapel to the hermitage and from its being annexed to  Walden  was called  Hadley Monachorum  It is at present a donative in the gift of the lords of the manor The present church is built

belonging to the  Benedictine  nunnery of  Haliwell  Sir  Thomas Lovel  who lived at the period in which this church was built was a great benefactor to the nunnery and had his residence at  En∣field  Whether he contributed to the building of  Hadley  does not appear otherwise it would seem to have been a badge of his but others have conjectured it to have been a rebus expres∣sive of the name of an

great mount  CASTLE  once the foundation of some more antient fortress perhaps one of the line of forts which crossed this and the neighboring counties One exists at  Toucester  and another I shall have occasion to speak of lying about three miles to the east I cannot speak with certainty of the period in which it was occupied by the  Saxons  who gave it the name of  Hamtune  Mr  Bridges  supposes it to have risen from the ruins of  Eltavon  a  Roman  station on the side of the town It appears that the  Danes  were possessed of  Northampton  in and from thence long made their barbarous excursions  Sax Chr    Before the year they had quitted the place but in their inroads in that year they burnt the town and desolated the country  IN it found in the  Northumbrians  under  Morcar  who had advanced as far as  Northampton  a cruel set of banditti who committed most unprovoked outrages They murdered the in∣habitants burnt the houses and carried off thousands of cattle and multitudes of prisoners But in the reign of  Edward  the Confessor here were LX burgesses in the king's lordship and LX houses At the time of the Conquest fourteen were waste but at the time of the survey there were forty burgesses in the new borough  Doomsdaybook  in  Mortor's Northampt    Simon de Sancto Licio  or  Senliz  a noble  Norman  founded here the castle He had married  Maude  daughter of

for his horses  Blunt's Antient Tenures    From that period it became considerable and frequently was the seat of parlements and was on several other occasions honored with the royal presence  I MUST particularize the great council held there in in which the contumacy of  Thomas Becket  was punished by a heavy fine At this time  the whole people came as one man  and yet all were unequal to the pride and obstinacy of the single prelate  Lord Lyttelton's Henry  II to  The other great council or parlement was summoned in to confirm the statutes of  Clarendon  in which the rights of the crown and customs of the realm especially as to judicial pro∣ceedings had been established  The same V octavo d edit    DURING the civil contests which  England  was so unhappily afflicted with it came in for its share of the calamities incident to war In that between king  John  and the barons it was stoutly defended on the part of the king against  Robert Fitzwalter  fana∣tically stiled marshal of  the army of God and the holy church  Cambden  i  who for want of military engines was obliged to raise the siege  Dugdale Baron  i  This post was of such importance that after the charter of liber∣ties was extorted from  John  the constable for the time being was sworn by the twentyfive barons appointed as a committee to  enforce its execution to govern the castle according to their pleasure This was done in the fullness of their power but as soon as the perjured prince got the upper hand he appointed  Fulk de Breans  a valiant but baseborn  Norman  to the com∣mand as one in whom he could entirely confide  Dugdale Baron  i    IN the year the younger  Mounfort  and his barons held it against their sovereign  Henry  III The king marched against them with a great force and having with his batteringrams made a great breach in that part of the townwalls nearest to the monastery of St  Andrew  entered the place and after a short but vigorous resistance made the whole garrison prisoners  Carte  ii    IN  Henry  VI made  Northampton  the place of rendezvous of his forces The strength of his army encouraged his spirited queen to offer battle to his young antagonist the earl of  Marche  then at the head of a potent army A conference was demanded by the earl and rejected by the royal party who marched out of the town and encamped in the meadows between it and  Har∣dinston  The battle was fierce and bloody but by the treachery of  Edmund  lord  Grey  of  Ruthen  who deserted his unhappy master victory declared in favor of the house of  York  Thousands were slain or drowned in the  Nen  among them the duke of  Bucking∣hum  earl of  Shrewsbury John  viscount  Beaumont  and lord  Egre∣mont  The duke was interred in the church of the  Grey Friars  others of the men of rank in the adjacent abbey of  De la Prè  and others in the hospital of St  John  in the town  THE town had been inclosed with a strong wall probably be∣fore  the reign of king  John  for mention is made in the second year of his reign of the eastgate one of the four The walls were of breadth sufficient for six men to walk abreast Both walls and castle were early neglected for they appear to have been in in a ruinous state  Norden  as quoted by  Bridges    yet part of it was used as a prison before the year and within had been a royal freechapel dedicated to St  George  to which a chaplain was pre∣sented by the crown with a salary of L  s  a year  IN the civil wars of the last century  Northampton  was seized by lord  Brook  for the use of the parlement In he forti∣fied it with a foss and ramparts converted the bridges into drawbridges and brought several pieces of cannon here to de∣fend it in case of attack Whether it distinguished itself by any particular acts of disloyalty beyond other places I cannot say but in pursuant to an order of council the walls gates and part of the castle were demolished  Bridges    RELIGIOUS HOUSES  THE most antient of the religious houses in this town was the priory of St  Andrew  ST ANDREW'S  founded about the year by  Simon de St Liz  first earl of  Northampton  of his name and  Maude  his wife He peopled it with cluniacs and in made it subject to the abbey of St  Mary de Caritate  a monastery upon the  Loire  This occasioned it to undergo the common fate of all alien priories that of being seized into the king's hands It was sur∣rendered to  Henry  at the dissolution by  Francis Abràe  then  prior who in reward for his ready compliance was appointed the first dean of  Peterborough  Willis  ii The

building  HOSPITAL OF ST JOHN  standing in  Bridgestreet  It consists of a chapel a large hall with apart∣ments for the brethren and two rooms above for the cobrothers It was founded for the reception of infirm poor probably by  William St Clere  archdeacon of  Northampton  who died possessed of that dignity in He is supposed to have been brother to one of the  Simon St Clere  but  Leland  justly

brethren founded before The mayor and burgesses were patrons  Dugdale  valued it at ten pounds a year  Tanner      I MUST not omit mention of the shortlived university which existed in this town  UNIVERSITY  and which arose from the following occa∣sion In  Otho  the pope's legate happened to visit the university of  Oxford  and took his residence at the neighboring  convent of  Osney  He was one day respectfully waited on by the students who were insolently refused admittance by the  Italian  por∣ter At length after intolerable provocation from the clerk of the kitchen a  Welsh  student drew his bow and shot him dead  Wood's Hist Ox  i  The resentment of government and the fear of punishment caused the first secession of the students to  Northampton  and other places In succeeding years fresh riots arose and occasioned farther migra∣tions At length these migrations were made under sanction of the king who imagined that the disturbances arose from the too great concourse of scholars to one place It is said that not fewer than fifteen thousand students settled in this town Whe∣ther from resentment of former proceedings against them or from the usual dislike youth has to governing powers they took the part of the barons They formed themselves into companies had their distinguishing banner and when  Henry  III made his attack on  Northampton  proved by far his most vigorous oppo∣nents After the king had made himself master of the place he determined to hang every student but being at length appeased he permitted them to return to  Oxford  under the conduct of  Simon Mountfort  and abolished the university of  Northamp∣ton  Bridges      THE town is extremely finely situated on an eminence  TOWS DESCRIBED  gently sloping to the river which bounds it on the south as it also does on the west The streets are in general strait and very handsomely built The great marketplace is an ornament to the town few can boast the like Much of the beauty of  Northampton  is owing to the calamity it sustained by fire on  Sep∣tember  th when the greatest part was laid in ashes The houses were at that time chiefly wooden Twentyfive thousand pounds were collected by briefs and private charity towards its relief and the king gave a thousand tons of timber out of  Whit∣tlewood  forest and remitted the duty of chimneymoney in this town for seven years so that it was soon rebuilt and changed its wooden edifices for more secure and ornamental houses of stone  THE church of  All Saints  fell a victim to the flames The old church was a large pile  CHURCHES  with a tower in the center It was re∣built with great magnificence and is a considerable ornament to this pretty town The portico is very elegant supported in front by eight columns of the Ionic order The body stands on four lofty columns and has a neat dome in the middle The roof beautifully stuccoed This church and that of St  Peter  were be∣stowed on the priory of St  Andrew  by  Simon de St Liz  the founder  All Saints  is at present in the gift of the members of the corporation who are inhabitants of the parish  THE church of the  Holy Sepulchre  was supposed to have been built by the Knights Templars on the model of that at  Jerusa∣lem  The imitative part is round  HOLY SEPULCHRE  with a nave issuing from it In the round part is a peristyle of eight round pillars thirteen feet eight inches high and twelve feet three in circumference The capitals consist of two round fillets the arches sharp and plain The space from the wall to the pillars is eleven feet the diameter from the inside of one pillar to that of the opposite is twentynine feet two inches In the center of the area stands in  the church at  Jerusalem  the supposed sepulchre  See  Sandys's Travels  and it is pro∣bable a model might be placed in those which we find of the same kind in our island for besides this the  Temple  church in  Lon∣don  and St  Sepulchre  's in  Cambridge  are built on the same plan The steeple and some other parts of that in question have been added after the building of the circular church  ST  Peter  's church is a singular building  ST PETER'S  Two corners of the tower are ornamented with three round pillars above these are two and above them one all gradually lesser than the others The middle of the tower is ornamented with small round arches which are continued along the outside of the body of the church and have a good effect Within are two rows of round arches carved with zigzag work the pillars which support these are al∣ternately single and quadruple A

hospital of St  Catherine  near the Tower in  London  and still re∣mains under its patronage  WHOSOEVER intended to clear himself of any criminal accusa∣tion in this town was obliged to do it in this church only having here first performed his vigil and prayers in the preceding evening  Bridges    St  Giles  's church stands in the east skirts of the town but contains nothing worthy notice  IN old times  Northampton  was possessed of three other  churches which are now destroyed St  Bartholomew  's stood on the east side of the road going to  Kingsthorp  and was bestowed by  St Liz  on his convent of St  Andrew  St  Edmund  's stood without the east gate and was also under the patronage of St  Andrew  's and the church of St  Gregory  was the third also the property of that muchfavored house  AMONG the public buildings I first speak of the county infir∣mary  INFIRMARY  not on account of the beauty or magnificence of the house for it is laudably destitute of both but because the subscription which supports it does honor to the province by proving the be∣nevolence of its inhabitants That of amounted to near eight hundred pounds and the number of patients perfectly cured from its foundation in to the former year is not fewer than thirteen thousand one hundred and fifty  THE county hall is a very handsome building  COUNTY HALL  and ornamented in the manner which gives dignity to courts of justice The vulgar are affected with external shew and never pay half the respect to a judge scampering in boots and bobwig up the stairs of a barnlike court as they would to the same person who adds solemnity to his merit and assumes the garb suited to his cha∣racter  THE jail is at a small distance from the sessions house  JAIL  and was originally a house built by a Sir  Thomas Haselwood  and sold by him to the justices of peace  THE town or guild hall is an antient building in which the corporation transacts its business  Northampton  was incorporated by  Henry  II  Henry  III gave it power of chusing annually a mayor and two bailiffs to be elected by all the freemen but  Henry  VII ordered by charter  CHARTER  that the mayor and his brethren  late mayors should name fortyeight persons of the inhabitants with liberty of changing them as often as was found necessary which fortyeight with the mayor and his brethren and such as had been mayors and bailiffs were annually to elect all future mayors and bailiffs There are besides a recorder chamberlain and townclerk The mayor late mayor and one other mem∣ber of the corporation nominated by the mayor aldermen

offenders but wisely leave all but petty larcenies to the judges of the great sessions  Bridges      Northampton  is among the most antient boroughs In the par∣lement held at  Acton Burnel  in the

about six miles southeast of the town in a wet country and without any advantage of situation It is a large structure surrounding a handsome square court with a beautiful skreen the work of  Inigo Jones  bounding one side More is attributed to that great architect Some is more antient than his time yet he probably had the restoring of the old house as the finishing appears by a date on the

was so extensive that in his youth he at once kept four different tutors in employ who daily had their respective hours for instructing him in the different arts they professed In the civil wars he was the great rival of lord  Brooks  whom he drove out of his own county of  Warwick  and was a most suc∣cessful opponent to the earl of  Essex  He brought two thousand of the bestdisciplined men in

little girl  THE other monument is of his son Sir  Henry  His figure is placed in his robes and on one side his lady  Anne  daughter of Sir  William Twisden  of  Rawdonhall  in  Kent  lies by him wrapped in a black cloak from head to feet Round her neck is a ruff in one hand an open book Above them is a vast canopy with various statues on the top This is supported on each side by two fulllength figures of almsmen in black gowns and hoods with great white beards the arch resting on their heads This probably alludes to some charitable foundation with which I am unacquainted In front beneath Sir  Henry  is an altar at which kneel two men in armour and two in cloaks and five women It does not appear that either Sir  Christopher  or Sir  Henry  left a number of children equal to those expressed on their respective tombs  IN my return I saw at  Little Billings  the poor remains of the mansion of the great family of the  Longvilles  LITTLE BILLINGS  John de Lungville  was declared lord of the place in This was he who founded the  Augustines  in  Northampton  It continued in the name till the time of queen  Elizabeth  or  James  I when that succession expired in the person of Sir  Edward Longeville  NOT far from hence I visited  Clifford's Hill  in the parish of  Houghton Parva  a vast artificial mount having once on it a  specula  or watchtower The coins found in and near it prove it to have been the work of the  Romans  Before the river  Nen  was diverted by the building of  Billings Bridge  the channel ran under this mount which it is supposed to have guarded  Morton      REACH  Northampton  and after a short stay pass over the river into the suburbs called the  South Quarters  and into the parish of  Hardingstone  On each side is a fine range of meadows those on the left are greatly enlivened by the beautiful plantations and im∣provements of the Honorable  Edward Bouverie  whose house stands on the site of the  Abbey de Pratis  or  de la Prè  a house of  Cluniac  nuns  DE LA PRÈ ABBEY  founded by  Simon de St Liz  the younger earl of  Northampton  Dugdale  i in which is the recital of the old charters  It had in it ten nuns at the time of the dissolu∣tion The last abbess  Clementina Stokes  governed it thirty years obtained the king's charter for the continuance of her convent but fearing to incur the displeasure of the tyrant resigned it into the hands of Doctor  London  the king's commissioner and got from him the character of  a gudde agyd woman  of her  howse being in a gudde state  and what was more substantial a pension of forty pounds a year  BETWEEN this place and the town in encamped  Henry  VI and his insolent nobility immediately before the bloody battle of  Northampton  The king or rather queen de∣pending on the strength of their entrenchments and warlike en∣gines returned a haughty answer to the humble proposals sent by the earls of  March  and  Warwick  BATTLE OF NORTHAMPTON  These spirited commanders led  their troops instantly to the attack and forced the camp favored by the treachery of  Edmund  lord  Grey  of  Ruthen  who on some disgust changed sides and assisted the enemy in forcing their way into the works "Ten thousand talle  Englishmen  and their "king" says  Halle  xxiv xxv The battle was fought  July  th  "were taken and numbers slain or drowned "in the river" for the fight was carried on with the obsti∣nacy usual in civil dissension  Humphrey  duke of  Buckingham John  earl of  Shrewsbury John  viscount  Beaumont Thomas  lord  Egremont  and Sir  Thomas Lucy  were among those who fell Multitudes of my countrymen also perished on that day  xxiv xxv The battle was fought  July  th  The slain were buried either in the church of this convent or in the hospital of St  John  ON the roadside  QUEEN'S CROSS  on an ascent near this place stands one of the pledges of affection borne by  Edward  I to his beloved  Eleanor  who caused a cross to be erected on the spot whereso∣ever her body rested in its way from  Hareby  in  Lincolnshire  where she died in to  Westminster  the place of her inter∣ment It is kept in excellent repair is of an octagonal form and stands on a base of seven steps Coats of arms and an open book adorn the lower compartments Above in six gothic niches are as many female figures crowned Above them are four modern dials facing the four cardinal points and above those is the cross  AROUND this spot are frequently found  Roman  coins and me∣dals from which it is conjectured that this might have been the site of  Eltavon  ELTAVON  or  Eltabon  from the  British Ael  a brow and  Avon  a river and is supposed to have been the  Eltanori  or  Eltavori  of the geographer of  Ravenna  Morton Northampton    Gale's Iter Br Com    The dry and elevated situation and its vicinity to a river makes it very probable that this was a  Roman  station at left a summer camp  NEAR this place on the summit of the hill called  Hunsborough  HUNSBOROUGH  are some antient works of a circular form  i e  conforming to the shape of it consisting of a foss and double rampart with a single entrance Mr  Morton  Morton    attributes this to the  Danes  and imagines it to have been a summercamp of one of the plunder∣ing parties which infested the kingdom of  Mercia  about the year Another was raised about the same time at  Temsford  in the county of  Bedford  for the same purpose This has very much the appearance of a  British  post but as there is great simi∣litude between the early fortifications of the northern nations I will not controvert the opinion of that ingenious author yet I have probability on my side as he admits that the  Danes  had possession of  Hamtune  i e  Northampton  in I think they would scarcely trouble themselves with raising these works so near their former quarters which for any thing that appears was as open to them in as in the former year  ABOUT five miles from  Queen's Cross  I turned a little out of my road to see  Horton

appointed her chamberlain and during the queen's regency on the king's expedition to  France  in had the re∣spect shewn him to be named as a council to her majesty occa∣sionally to be called in  Herbert's Henry VIII    He died in left four daughters the eldest of whom conveyed by marriage with Sir  Ralph Lane  the estate into his family  ON the floor are the figures of  Roger Salusbury  between his two wives in brass He died in first owner of his name of this estate whose grandaughter became mistress of it on the death of her father  William  THE  Lanes  kept it for some generations On the death of Sir  William  it was found to be held of Sir  Richard Chetwood  as of his manor of  Woodhall  by the service of one knight's see suit of court and the annual payment of  s  towards the guard of  Rockingham  castle The estate passed from the  Lanes  I believe by purchase to Sir  Henry Mountague  first earl of  Manchester  and by descent fell to the earl of  Halifax  and is now

of a hundred and twentyeight  acres and on the sides are others of great extent The woods are vast and cut into walks extensive and pleasing Several pretty pieces of water the view of the  Ouze  and its verdant mea∣dows and the old respectable house of  Tyringham  with its church on the opposite side are no small embellishments to the place  THIS manor at the time of the compilation of the  Doomsdaybook  was held by  Robert de Nodavirs  or  de Nouers  under  Odo  bishop of  Baieux  earl of  Kent  and halfbrother to the Conqueror  THE DE NOUERS  The  De Nouers  became possessed of it in their own right in the time of  Henry  II perhaps earlier  Mr  Cole  but the first I meet with is  Radulphus  and his son  Almaric  who lived in the thirtyseventh of  Henry  III It continued in that family till  Digby Pedigree  to  the tenth of  Henry  IV when it became the property of  Robert Nevyll  descended from  Hugo de Nevyll  who had lands in  Essex  in or the thirtyfifth of  Edward  III  Robert Nevyll  possessed him∣self of  Gothurst  by marrying  Joanna  sister and sole heir to the last  Almaric de Nouers  his two other sisters  Agnes  and  Gracia  having preferred a monastic life  The same      THE  Nevylls  remained owners of it till the reign of  Henry  VIII when  Maria  NEVYLLS  only daughter of  Michael Nevyll  on the death of her two brothers became possessed of it and she bestowed it with her person  MULSHOS  on  Thomas Mulsho  of  Thingdon  in the county of  Northamp∣ton  The same  a respectable family I find sheriffs of the name as early as the time of  Richard  II and one of that house governor of  Calais  in the reign of  Henry  VI But the first mention of the name is in when lived  John Mulsho  of  Goddington  Gothurst  continued with the  Mulshos  till the

by an ignominious and merited death for his deep concern in the plot which thanks to the charity of the times is execrated by each religion It is very probable that a mind so tinctured with bigotry as his was soon devoted itself to the most desperate resolutions for the restoration of the antient church He foresaw the certain consequences of ill success and preparing against the event took every method to preserve his infant son from suffering from the fault of the father Before he committed any acts of treason he secured to his heirs his estates in such a man∣ner as to put it out of the

The origin is  Saxon  The first of whom notice is taken is  Aelmar  who had lands at  Tilton  in  Leicestershire  in the twentieth of  William  the Conqueror They afterwards took the name of  Digby  from a place in  Lincolnshire  and became owners of  Stokedry  in  Rutland∣shire  which till the acquisition of  Gothurst  was their usual resi∣dence by the marriage of  Everard Digby  Esquire in the reign of king  Henry  VI with  Agnes  daughter of  Francis Clare  of  Wyssenden  and  Stokedry  Esquire This gentleman with three of his sons fell in the bloody field at  Towton  fighting in the cause of the house of  Lancaster  Collin's Peerage  vii    MOST of the particulars relative to this great family  DIGBY PEDIGREE  I owe to the friendship of my worthy neighbor  Watkin Williams  Esquire who favored me with the use of the famous genealogy of the  Digbys  of  Tilton  a book compiled by the direction of Sir  Kenelm  in at the expence of twelve hundred pounds This tradi∣tion is very credible to any who have seen the book a large folio consisting of five hundred and eightynine vellum leaves the first hundred and sixtyfive ornamented with the coats of arms of the family and its allies and of all the tombs of the  Digbys  then extant illuminated in the richest and most exquisite manner The rest of the book is composed of grants wills and variety of other pieces serving to illustrate the

Katharine  a nun at  Sempringham  Darnegold  I NOW return to the period when the family emerged from its misfortune and in the person of Sir  Kenelm  the son of the last Sir  Evarard  was restored to its former honor by the uncommon merits of the successor He married  Venetia  daughter of Sir  Edward Stanley  of  Tongue Castle Shropshire  Knight of the Bath His eldest son  Kenelm  was slain in in the civil wars at  St Neots  his second son  John  succeeded to the estate and sur∣vived  his father many years He left by his wife  Margaret  daughter of Sir  Edward Longueville  of  Wolverton  in this county Baronet two daughters the eldest  Margaret Maria  married Sir  John Conway  of  Boddruddan  in  Flintshire  the younger  Char∣lotta  married  Richard Mostyn  of  Penbedw  in the same county Esquire These two gentlemen in sold this manor with  Stoke Goldington  and the advowson of both the churches to  George Wright  Esquire son of the lord keeper Sir  Nathan Wright  in whose posterity it still remains By the preceding owners the reliques of Sir  Kenelm  's collection came into my country but the leaving behind the two beautiful busts of lady  Venetia  impress no favorable idea of their taste  SOME portraits  PORTRAITS  belonging to the former possessors still keep a place in the house In the parlour is a fulllength of old Mr  Digby  OLD MR DIGBY  father to the unhappy Sir  Everard  He is represented in a close black dress a laced turnover ruff and with lace at his wrist his hair black his beard round with one hand on his sword the other  HIS lady  HIS LADY  Mary  daughter of  Francis Neile  Esquire of  Prest∣wold  and  Keythorp  in  Leicestershire  and widow to the  Staffordshire  antiquary  Sampson Erdeswik  Her dress is black pinked with red has a high foretop adorned with jewels a thin upright ruff round kerchief a farthingale with gloves in her hand  THEIR son  SIR EVERARD  the victim to bigotry is here at fulllength in a black mantle and vest the sleeves slashed and pinked with white large turnover and turnups at his wrists one hand holds his gloves the other is gracefully folded in his mantle  A REMARKABLE portrait  SIR KENELM  of a young man of large size in a quilled ruff white jacket black cloak purple hose flowered  belt a bonnet with a white feather in it flowered belt with one hand on his sword Above him in a tablet is represented a lady in a most supplicatory attitude with a lute in one hand and a purse in the other offering it to him He stands by her with averted look one hand on his breast and with an air which shews his rejection of her addresses and horror at the infamy of merce∣nary love and as if uttering to her the words inscribed near to him  his majora  This portrait is inscribed on the back  John Digby  but from the romantic circumstance attending it the dress and the likeness to other pictures of Sir  Kenelm  I cannot help supposing it to be his    THIS is a portrait of the famous Sir  Kenelm  in his youthful days that prodigy of learning credulity valour and romance whose merits although mixed with many foibles entirely oblite∣rated every attention to the memory of his father's infamy The circumstance of the lady painted along with him is a strong con∣firmation of the truth of the story related by  Lloyd  that an  Italian  prince who was childless earnestly wished that his princess might become a mother by Sir  Kenelm  whom he esteemed as a just mo∣del of perfection It is probable that the princess would not have disobeyed the commands of her lord but whether the painting alludes to our knight's cruelty on this occasion or whether it might not describe the adventure of the  Spanish  lady recorded in an elegant old ballad  Antient Songs and Ballads  ii  I will not pretend to determine  IN the long room above stairs  LADY VENETIA  is the picture of his beloved wife  Venetia Anastatia Stanley  in a  Roman  habit with curled locks In one hand is a serpent the other is on a pair of white doves  She is painted at  Windsor  in the same emblematic manner but in a different dress and with accompaniments explanatory of the emblems The doves shew her innocency the serpent which she handles with impunity shews her triumph over the enve∣nomed tongues of the times We know not the particulars of the story Lord  Clarendon  must allude to her exculpation of the charge whatsoever it was when he mentions her as  a lady of an extraordinary beauty of as extraordinary same  Lord Clarendon's Life      In the same picture is a genius about to place a wreath on her head Beneath her is a Cupid prostrate and behind him is Calumny with two faces flung down and bound a beautiful compliment on her victory over Malevolence Her hair in this picture is light and differs in color from that in the other I have heard from a descendant of her's that she affected different hairdresses and differentcolored eyebrows to see which best became her  SIR  Kenelm  was so enamoured with her beauty that he was said to have attempted to exalt her charms and preserve her health by a variety of whimsical experiments Among others that of feed∣ing her with capons fed with the flesh of vipers  I am told that the great snail or  Pomatia Br Zool  iv N  o  is found in the neighboring woods which is its most southern residence in this island It is of exotic origin Tradition says it was introduced by Sir  Kenelm  as a medicine for the use of his lady  and that to improve her complexion he was perpetually inventing new cos∣metics Probably she fell a victim to these arts for she was found dead in bed  May  st in the thirtythird year of her age She was buried in  Christchurch London  under a large insu∣lated  BUST of LADY VENETIA DIGBY  tomb of black marble with her bust on the top This pe∣rished in the great fire but the form is represented in the  Pedigreebook  and from that engraven in the  Antiquaries Reper∣tory  BOTH the pictures are the performances of  Vandyck  In this at  Gothurst  are two of her sons of a boyish age and in the dress of the times  HERE are besides two most beautiful busts of the same lady  BUSTS OF LADY VENETIA  in brass whether by  Le Soeur  or  Fanelli  I am not certain One is in the dress of the times an elegant laced handkerchief falls over her shoulders leaving her neck bare Her hair is curled braided twisted and formed on the hind part of her head into a circle beneath which fall elegant locks On this bust is in∣scribed  Uxorem vivam amare voluptas defunctam religio  THE other is  a l'antique  The head is dressed in the same man∣ner only bound in a fillet the drapery covers her breast but so artificially as not to destroy the elegancy of the form  I KNOW of no persons who are painted in greater variety of forms and places than this illustrious pair possibly because they were the finest subjects of the times Mr  Walpole  is in possession of several most exquisite miniatures of the lady by  Oliver  bought from the heirs of  Boddrudan  and  Pembedw  at a very high price The most valuable is one in a gold case where she is painted in company with her husband There is another said to be painted after she was dead and four others in watercolors  THE same gentleman is in possession of a beautiful miniature  of her mother lady  Lucy Percy  purchased at the same time She is dressed like a citizen's wife and with dark hair  AMONG other portraits  LORD KEEPER WRIGHT  is a fulllength of the lord keeper Sir  Nathan Wright  in his robes and a head of Sir  Joseph Jekyll  with a long wig and robes The first received his appointment in the year unfortunately for him as successor to lord  Somers  whose precipitate dismission in favor of a Tory hardly allowed time for reflection on the impropriety of the choice Sir  Nathan  kept his place till the year when he was dismissed not without disgrace more through defect of ability than want of integrity but contemned by both parties  SIR  Joseph  was a very different character a staunch Whig and a man of great abilities and worth He died Master of the Rolls in His wig was probably none of the best if we are to trust these complimentary lines of  Pope  Epilogue to the Satires    A horselaugh if you please on honesty  A joke on  Jekyll  or some odd old Whig  Who never chang'd his principle or wig  THE church is at a little distance from the house  CHURCH  is new and very neat having been rebuilt in pursuance of the will of  George Wright  Esquire son of the keeper The figures of father and son face you as you enter the church the first in his robes the other in a plain gown both furnished with enormous  Parian  perri∣wigs  In the old church was a gravestone lying in the chancel sup∣posed  to have been laid over  John de Nouers  who lived

 iii  A Sir  John Tyring∣ham  had the honor of losing his head in the cause of  Henry  VI being with several others put to death unheard in for the murder of the duke of  York  that is for being present at the battle of  Wakefield  where that prince fell by some unknown hand It continued in this antient family till when on the death of Sir  William Tyringham  it devolved to  John  son of  Edward Backwell  alderman of  London  who had married his only daughter  THE house has been neglected for some time but not wholly unfurnished Several familyportraits still continue there such as a head of lady  Tyringham  PORTRAITS  in a yellow laced cap and ruff of  the same kind with that in which the famous Mrs  Turner  went to be hanged for her concern in  Overbury  's murder  A VERY curious picture fulllength of an aged lady in a great quilled ruff and gauze cap distended behind with an enor∣mous gauze veil falling to the ground a black gown spotted with white jewels in form of a cross on her breast another on her arm and great strings of pearl round her wrists She stands beneath a canopy on which is a crown and coat of arms  ANOTHER of a young lady leaning on a chair in a gauze cap falling back yellow petticoat flowered with red and a feathersan  A HALFLENGTH of Colonel  Backwell  in blue gold sleeves and frogs a sash and a battle in view  A SMALL portrait of  Edward Backwell  EDW BACKWELL  Esquire He is repre∣sented in long hair and a flowered gown with a table by him I have a fine print of him given me by the late Mr  Backwell  one of his descendants He was says Mr  Granger  an alderman of  London  and a banker of great ability industry and integrity and of most extensive credit but ruined in the reign of  Charles  II by the infamous project of shutting up the Exchequer He retired to  Holland  where he died and was brought over to be interred in the church of  Tyringham  where he lies embalmed A glass is placed over his face so his visage may possibly be seen to this time  I COULD not but admire a spirited picture of a Falcon stooping at Bitterns  IN the hall is a curious table of an ashcolored marble I should call it a polynesious marble being veined like a chart filled with little islands nicely shaded at their edges  As my curiosity led me to explore the kitchen I found on the walls the rude portraits of me following fish recorded to be taken in the adjacent river in the years belowmentioned  A carp in feet inches long  A pike in  A bream  A salmon  A perch  A shad in  These are the records of rural life important to those who were perhaps happily disengaged from the bustle and cares attendant on politics and dissipation  THE adjacent church is dedicated to St  Peter  and united with  Filgrave  it is in the gift of Mr  Backwell  The village of  Tyring∣ham  is quite depopulated and the church of  Filgrave  dilapi∣dated but the inhabitants of that parish make use of the church of  Tyringham  ABOUT a mile farther go through the village of  Lathbury  LATHBURY  near which is the church and a large old house  A LITTLE farther is  Newport Pagnel  in former times of dan∣gerous approach  NEWPORT PAGNEL  by reason of the overflowing of the  Ouze  This small town stands between that river and the  Lovet  near their junction Soon after the Conquest it was the property of  William FitzAusculph  Dugdale Baron  i  from him it passed to the  Paganels  or  Painels  in the reign of  William Rufus  who continued possessed of it above a century  Leland  mentions them as lords of the  castle of  Newport Pagnel  Ireland Itin  i  On the death of  Gervase Pagnel  in the reign of  Richard  I this manor became the property of  John de Somerie  by marriage with  Hawise  daughter of  Gervase  Dugdale Baron  i  His son  Ralph  gave king  John  a hundred pounds and two palfreys for livery of this lordship and did homage for it In the reign of  Henry  III  Roger de Somerie  forfeited his lands for neglecting on summons to receive the honor of knighthood  The same p  The king then granted the farm of this place to  Walter de Kirkham  for life quit∣ting him of suits to county and hundred and of aid to sheriffs and his bailiffs and that when the king or his heirs should tal∣lage their manors and demesnes the said  Walter  might by him∣self and to his own use tallage the said manor in like form as it might be tallaged if it were in the king's hand  Madox Antiq Exch  i  But I find that it afterwards reverted to the  Someries  In the reign of  Edward  II it was conveyed to  Thomas de Botetourt  by his marriage with  Joan  one of the sisters of  John de Somerie  last male heir  Dugdale Baron  ii  I now lose sight of the succession and can only say that it continued a place of strength till the civil wars of the last century when its strength was demolished or according to the phrase of the time slighted by order of parlement in  Whitelock      IT flourishes greatly  LACE MANUFACTURE  by means of the lace manufacture which we stole from the  Flemings  and introduced with great success into this county There is scarcely a door to be seen during summer in most of the towns but what is occupied by some industrious  palefaced lass their sedentary trade forbidding the rose to bloom in their sickly cheeks  THE church is dedicated to St  Peter  and St  Paul  CHURCH  was an im∣propriation belonging to the neighboring abbey of  Tickford  and is in the gift of the crown  Here were three hospitals founded in early times That by  John de Somerie  HOSPITALS  about the year still survives for three poor men and the same number of poor women having been re∣founded by  Anne  of  Denmark  and from her is called  Queen Anne's Hospital  The vicar of  Newport  for the time being is appointed

traverse the east end of the former county  WOBURN SANDS  and contain the parishes of the three  Brickhills  Near the road side are the noted pits of fullers earth that invaluable substance  FULLERS EARTH  which is supposed to give that great superiority to the  British  cloth honestly worked over that of other nations  THE beds over this important marl are firstly several layers of reddish sand to the thickness of six yards then succeeds a stra∣tum of sandstone of the same color beneath which for seven or eight yards more the sand is again continued to the fullers earth the upper part of which being impure or mixed with sand is  flung aside the rest taken up for use The earth lies in layers under which is a bed of rough white freestone about two feet thick and under that sand beyond that the laborers never have penetrated  THE great use of this earth is cleansing the cloth or imbibing the tar grease and tallow which are so frequently employed by the shepherds in healing the external diseases which sheep are liable to neither can the wool be worked spun or woven unless it be well greased All this grease must be gotten out before the cloths are fit to wear Other countries either want this species of earth or have it in less perfection The  British  legislature there∣fore have from the days of  Charles  I guarded against the expor∣tation under severe penalties The  Romans  attended to the full∣ing business by their  lex Metella  which was made expressly to re∣gulate the manufacture  Keque enim pigebit hanc quoque partem attingere cum lex  Metella  extet

small distance from hence lies the little town of  Woburn  WOBURN TOWN  in which is a freeschool founded by  Francis  I earl of  Bedford  and a charityschool for thirty boys by  Wriothesly  duke of  Bed∣ford  The church was built by the last abbot of  Woburn  Willis  ii  and  CHURCH  belonged to that religious house having been a chapel to  Birch∣more  a church long since demolished This place is of exempt jurisdiction under the patronage of the adjacent great family  Ecton    The steeple is oddly disjoined from the church The chancel has been very elegantly fitted up with stucco by the late duke The pulpit is a pretty piece of  gothic  carving probably coeval with the abbey  A NEAT monument of Sir  Francis Stanton  is preserved here  TOMBS  who with his lady is kneeling at an altar  IN the south aile stood a grey marble robbed of the figure of a priest under a large canopy and four coats of arms with the in∣scription entire  Hic jacet  Joh  s  Morton  filius quonda  Johes Morton  de

 IN the east window were the arms of  Robert Vere  earl of  Oxford  impaling  Samford  the last in right of his wife  Alice  daughter and heiress to  Gilbert  lord  Samford  chamberlain to  Elinor  consort to  Edward  I  These two particulars I collect from Mr  Cole  's papers  AT a little distance from the town was situated the abbey  ABBEY  founded in by  Hugh de Bolebec  a nobleman of great property in this neighborhood who inspired by God made a visit to the abbot of  Fountains  to advise with him about his pious design  Dugale Monast  i  The abbot encouraged him to proceed and  Hugh  erected the buildings endowed them and peopled them with monks of the  Cistercian  order and placed over them as first abbot  Alan  brought from the monastery of  St Mary  at  York  Willis  ii  The place prospered by several benefac∣tions and at the dissolution was found according to  Dugdale  to be possessed of revenues to the amount of £  s    d  a year or to £  s    d  according to  Speed  Tanner      THE last abbot  Robert Hobbs  was hanged at  Woburn  in  March  for not acknowleging the king's supremacy The monas∣tery and its revenues in were granted by  Edward  VI to lord  Russel  soon after created earl of  Bedford  by the same prince No one profited so greatly by the plunder of the church as this family the fortune even to the present time doth principally originate from gifts of this nature To the grant of  Woburn  it owes much of its property in this county and in  Bucks  to that of the rich abbey of  Tavistoke  vast fortunes and interest in  Devon∣shire  and to render them more extensive that of  Dunkeswell  was added The donation of  Thorney  abbey gave him an amazing tract of fens in  Cambridgeshire  together with a great revenue  Melchburn  abbey I should have before said increased his property in  Bedfordshire  the priory of  Castle Hymel  gave him footing in  Northamptonshire  and he came in for parcels of the appurtenance of  St Alban's  and  Mountgrace  in  Yorkshire  not to mention the house of the friars preachers in  Exeter  with the revenues belong∣ing to the foundation and finally the estate about  Covent Gar∣den  with a field adjoining called  The Seven Acres  on which  Long Acre  is built appertenances to the convent of  Westminster  the first a garden belonging to the abbot  THE superstitious will stand amazed that no signal judgment has overtaken the children of sacrilege yet no house in  Britain  has thriven more than the house of  Russel  THE house is situated in a very pleasant park well wooded  HOUSE  but defective in water the several pieces being too much di∣vided and the dams too conspicuous The present house was built by the late duke excepting a paltry grotto by  Inigo Jones  which shews that his taste was superior to such childish perfor∣mances and the great stables which were part of the antient cloisters and still preserve their pillars and vaulted roof The offices are also the work of the late duke and form two magni∣ficent but plain buildings at a small distance from the mansion  THIS house is a treasure of paintings of portraits of the great  PORTRAITS  now illustrious by their figure they make in the eyes of posterity undazzled with their wealth rank power or qualifica∣tions mental or corporeal which concealed their failings and made them pass at lest unnoticed openly by their cotemporaries They now undergo a posthumous trial and like the  Egyptians  of old receive censure or praise according to their respective merits  THE first which struck me was a lady who defied the strictest  scrutiny a small fulllength in widow's weeds with her head reclined on one hand and a book by her  RACHEL LADY RUSSEL  with a countenance full of deep and silent sorrow the sad relict of the virtuous lord RUSSEL and daughter to the good and great  Wriothesly  earl of  Southampton  I imagine her in the third month of her affliction filled with the following meditation  LORD let me understand the reason of these dark and wounding providences that I sink not under the discourage∣ment of my own thoughts I know I have deserved my pu∣nishment and will be silent under it but yet secretly my heart mourns because I have not the dear companion and sharer of my joys and sorrows I want him to talk with to eat and sleep with All these things are irksome to me now the day unwelcome and the night so too All company and meals I would avoid if it might be yet all this is that I enjoy not the world in my own way and this sure hinders my comfort When I see my children before me I remember the pleasure he took in them This makes my heart to shrink Can I regret his quitting a lesser good for a bigger O if I did stedfastly believe I could not be dejected But I will not injure myself to say I offer my mind any inferior consolation to supply this loss no I most willingly forsake this world this vexatious troublesome world in which I have no other business but to rid my soul from sin secure by faith and a good conscience my eternal interest with patience and courage bear my eminent misfortunes and ever hereafter be above the smiles and frowns of it and when I have done the remnant of the work ap∣pointed me on earth then joyfully wait for the heavenly per∣fection in GOD'S good time when by his infinite mercy I  may be accounted worthy to enter in the same place of rest and repose where he is gone for whom only I grieve  Lady Russel's Letters  Letter vi    I NOW turn my eyes to a lady whose felicity consisted in a dif∣ferent fate in being early cut off from the embraces of a capri∣cious tyrant  LADY JANE SEYMOUR  whose inconstancy and whose lusts would probably have involved her in misery had not heaven in its mercy taken her to itself Lady  Jane Seymour  the lady in question became queen to  Henry  VIII in and was released from him by death The portrait expresses the elegance of her person She is dressed in red with great gold network sleeves and rich in jewels Her print among the illustrious heads does her little justice  THAT gloomy insipid pair  Philip  II and his consort  Mary  PHILIP AND MARY  are painted in small fulllengths by Sir  Antonio More  The first of these ungracious figures is dressed in a black jacket with gold sleeves and hose the queen sitting in a blackandgold petticoat and furred sleeves Her black conic cap is faced with gold and jewels A rich chain of great pearls and small vases red and gold are other ornaments to our bigotted sovereign The date is Sir  Antonio  was sent from  Spain  to draw her picture so has placed them in a scene of aukward courtship for they were not married till the following year  ANOTHER remarkable portrait by the same painter  ED COURTENEY EARL OF DEVONSHIRE  is that of  Edward Courteney  last earl of  Devonshire  of his name who for his nearness in blood to the crown was imprisoned by the jealous  Henry  from the age of ten till about that of twentyeight His daughter  Mary  set him at liberty and wooed him to share the king∣dom with her He rejected her offer in preference to her sister  Elizabeth  for which and some false suspicion of disaffection he suffered another imprisonment with  Elizabeth  He was soon re∣leased He quitted the kingdom as prudence directed and died at the age of thirty at  Padua  HE is represented as a handsome man with short brown hair and a yellow beard a dark jacket with white sleeves and breeches behind him is a ruined tower beneath him this in∣scription expressive of his misfortunes  En puer et insons et adhuc juvenilibus annis  Annos

white slashed jacket a threequarter length He was a deserved favorite of queen  Elizabeth  who well might think the court deficient without him for to uncommon knowlege valour and virtuous gallantry was joined a romantic spirit congenial with that of his royal mistress His romance of  Arcadia  is not relished at present it may be te∣dious but the morality I fear renders it disgusting to our age It is too replete with innocence to be relished Sir  Philip  was to the  English  what the Chevalier  Bayard  was to the  French Un Chevalier sans peur et sans reproches  Both were strongly tinctured with enthusiastic virtue both died in the field with the highest sentiments of piety  I LAMENT that the portraits are not placed in chronological order I must give them as I found them  Isabella

directed his intentions Posterity must applaud his unavailing engagements with due censure of the  Machiavelian  necessity of taking off so dangerous an opposer of the machina∣tions of his enemies The law of politics gives sanction to the removal of every obstacle to the designs of statesmen At the same time we never should lessen our admiration and pity of the generous characters who fell sacrifices to their hopes of delivering purified to their descendants the corrupted government of their own days To attempt to clear lord RUSSEL from the share in so glorious a design would be to deprive him of a most brilliant part of his character His integrity and ingenuity would not suffer even himself to deny that part of the charge Let that re∣main unimpeached since he continues so perfectly acquitted of the most distant design of making assassination a means or of in∣triguing with a foreign monarch the most repugnant to our re∣ligion and freedom to bring about so desired an end

tournaments in which she had opportunity to compare her feeble bridegroom with the dexterity the grace and strength of her valiant knight who at single combat overthrew man and horse The  French  envious of his prowess introduced into the lists a gigantic  German  in hopes of bringing the  English  hero into disgrace He treated the  Almain  so roughly that the  French  interfered but in a

exalted kind Hospitality charity and piety were in her preeminent I speak not of her great maternal cares nature dictates that more or less in all the sex but her abilities in the management of the vast affairs of her family perplexed with numberless litigations gave her a distinguished character She at left equalled her lord in loyalty and was indefatigable in inciting the nobility who had quitted the cause of majesty to expiate their error After the battle of  Worcester  she lived three years in privacy at her brother's house at  Ampthill  and had cor∣respondence with several great personages on the subject of re∣storing the exiled king The reserved  Monk  had such an opinion of her prudence as to communicate to her the signal by which she might know his intentions on that subject She lived in high esteem to a very advanced age died in and was interred by her beloved lord at  Derby  IT is no wonder that so illustrious a character should attract the powers of the poets She had the honor of being celebrated by one equal in rank to her own That accomplished nobleman  William  earl of  Pembroke  wrote several poems to her and dedicated a col∣lection of them to her  There is wit and ease in several but a great want of correction and often of harmony The follow∣ing is the lest faulty  Communicated to me by Mr WALPOLE who is in possession of this very scarce book a

cowards prove  And ships return'd do rot upon the shore  Then tho' thou frown I'll say thou art most fair  And still I'll love tho' still I must despair  As heat to life so is desire to love  For these once quench'd both life and love are done  Let not my sighs nor tears thy virtue move  Like basest metals do not melt too soon  Laugh at my woes although I ever mourn  Love surfeits with rewards

the field and in the lists of arms At  York  he fought and vanquished in the presence of  Henry  IV two valiant knights one a  Frenchman  the other an  Italian  In reward for his prow∣ess  Henry  created him knight of the Garter He signalized him∣self at the battle of  Azincourt  where he took prisoner  Louis de Bourbon  count of  Vendome  and had his ransom confirmed to him  Sandford's Genealog Hist    with which he might have built the house for it seems to be the  spoiles  alluded to by  Leland  In reward for his services he was created by  Henry  VI baron of  Fanhope  and  Millbrook  and died in He had no lawful issue neither were the large grants made to him by the crown for more than term of life so that they reverted on his decease  THE place was afterwards bestowed by  Edward  IV on  Edmund  lord  Grey  The gift was not as  Leland  supposes founded on the ruin of lord  Fanhope  after the battle of  Northampton  for that event did not take place till seventeen years after  Fanhope  died peaceably in his bed It continued in the family of the  Greys  till the death of  Richard  earl of  Kent  who made it over to  Henry  VIII That prince added it to the crown and erected it with the great estate belonging to it into the  honour of Ampthill  Cambden  i  Here was the residence of the injured princess  Catherine  of  Arra∣gon  during the period that her

year  John  earl of  Ossory  on the site of the castle erected a gothic column designed by Mr  Essex  to perpetuate the memory of this illfated queen with the following elegant inscription  In days of old here  Ampthill  's towers were seen  The mournful refuge of an injur'd queen  Here flow'd her pure but unavailing tears  Here blinded zeal sustain'd her sinking years  Yet Freedom hence her

was daughter to  Mark Cornaro  the most il∣lustrious of the  Venetian  families  James Lusignan  or  James  the Bastard king of  Cyprus  in order to strengthen himself in his throne demanded by his ambassador a wife out of the republic of  Venice  The senate fixed on this lady adopted her as their own and stiled her from its tutelar saint the  daughter of St Mark  She reigned long in that island and governed fifteen  years after the death of her husband He had left the senate of  Venice  protectors of her and the child with which she was preg∣nant at the time of that event The infant son lived only ten months and the  Venetian  state considered itself as heir to the kingdom in right of its daughter  Catherine  Apprehensions arose that the  Turkish  emperor  Bajazet  and the  Christian  mo∣narch  Ferdinand  had designs on it they determined to frustrate both and sent  George Cornaro  brother to the queen to assist her in the government By his eloquence he succeeded in the ardu∣ous task of persuading a lady out of her love of power He pro∣mised her regal state in her native county She accepted the terms and erected the  Venetian  standard in her capital and on her arrival at  Venice  was met by the whole senate and the ladies of rank and received during life every mark of esteem which her patriotism merited with a magnificent establishment equal to the dignity she had so generously quitted This event happened about the year  Gratiani's Wars of Cyprus      Albert  archduke of  Austria  commonly called the  Cardinal In∣fant  CARDINAL INFANT  in black a great ruff and

reign of  Philip  II who had invested him with their government In the  year  Philip  bestowed on him his daughter the  infanta Isa∣bella  and with her the sovereignty of the  Netherlands  Under him was undertaken the famous siege of  Ostend  which cost the  Spaniards  a hundred thousand men He lived till the year and died universally lamented by his subjects He was a patron of the arts He was so

duke of  York  lord  Ossory  lord  Palmerston Topham Beauclerk  colonel  H St John  and Sir  William Boothby  done when they were at  Florence  by  Brompton  Ampthill Park  and that of  Houghton  contiguous to it were granted by  James  I to Sir  Edward Bruce  of  Kinloss  a favorite brought by his majesty out of  Scotland  or to his son  Thomas  earl of  Elgin  It continued for some time in his posterity earls of  Elgin  and of  Aylesbury  It became about the year by purchase the property of lord  Ashburnham  who built the house which still retains nearly the original form It was alienated by  John  the first earl of that title between the years and to lord viscount  FitzWilliam  His lordship sold it in the year to lady  Gowran  grandmother to the present lord  Ossory  FROM hence is a very short ride to  Houghton Park  HOUGHTON PARK  formerly part of the estate of  Ampthill  As soon as that honor was alien∣ated from the crown the earl of  Elgin  pulled down the old castle  HOUGHTON  and built what is now called  Houghton House  and inclosed the park which goes by that name and then  Old Ampthill Park  be∣came only the second park to the seat The house is seated on a bold eminence and commands a fine view Two of the fronts are very beautiful each has an elegant portico and loggio above On the intervening space are variety of cyphers devices and crests such as bears and ragged staves staves and palms crowned lions and crowns and beards of arrows or hedgehogs and porcupines  In an old edition of the  Arcadia  date is a hedgehog or porcupine as a crest to the top of a frontispiece A proof perhaps of a  Sydney  being con∣cerned in the plan  Some of these certainly relate to the  Sydnies  This gave rise to the assertion of the editor of  Cambden  that it was built by the countess of  Pembroke  Sydney  's sister  Pembroke  's mother  and that the model was contrived by her brother the incompa∣rable Sir  Philip Sydney  in his  Arcadia  From the letters on the south front I R with a crown over them it is evident that the house was built in the time of  James  I and as there is great rea∣son to suppose that  Inigo Jones  was the architect it is possible that he might have been recommended by that lady wife to  William  earl of  Pembroke  one of  Inigo  's great patrons from whose designs the earl built the noble front of his seat at  Wilton  Let this be admitted we are not to wonder at seeing the devices of her beloved brother ornamenting a place with which she might have no connections but those of friendship  THE portico and loggio are of stone and ornamented with  columns of the Doric and Ionic orders the rest of the house is of brick The fronts are unequal one being a hundred and twentytwo feet in extent the other only seventythree feet six inches  THE house and manor were purchased by the late duke of  Bed∣ford  from  Charles  earl of  Aylesbury  and with it the stewardship of the honor of  Ampthill  hold under the crown  THIS place

one declined acting a third  struck with his own imprudence resigned  Crew  continued ob∣stinately servile and suspended thirty of his clergy for refusing to come into the views of the court Conscious of his conduct he fled out of the kingdom at the Revolution but at length made his peace and died in aged eightyeight after having been bishop and of  Durham  fortyseven His charity it is to be hoped

master a thousand and thirtythree pounds six shillings and eight pence for which he received an assignment of the fifteenth and tenth granted by parlement in and soon after he was re∣warded with being made knight of the Garter He valiantly supported the royal cause at the first battle of  St Alban's  and was carried out of it dreadfully wounded yet with the fickleness of the times he joined the duke of  York  in and was of course attainted by the  Lancastrian  parlement He fought va∣liantly in  Towton  field and received as recompence for his for∣mer loss the office of chief butler of  England  and the stewardship of the castle and manor of  Berkhamstead  and was created a baron  Dugdale's Baron  ii  He was employed by the  Yorkists  in several important embassies and advanced to the great post of lieutenant of  Calais  Notwithstanding all these favors he again revolted and joined the earl of  Warwick  to restore the deposed  Henry  He raised forces and joined  Margaret  of  Anjou  before the battle of  Tewkes∣bury  He was appointed by the general  John  earl of  Somerset  to the command of what was called the middle ward of the army When  Somerset  who led the van found himself unsupported in  the fierce attack he had made on the enemy he returned enraged to see the cause He found lord  Wenlock  with his troops standing in the marketplace Whether a panic had seized him or whe∣ther through a mutability of mind he was meditating a new re∣volt does not appear but the earl unable to curb his fury rode up and with one blow of his battleax clove the skull of the supposed traitor  Halle's Chr  xxxii  He was interred at  Tewkesbury  and his tomb is still to be seen in that noble church  IN this chapel are several tombs one very magnificent in the altarform with

died in and was buried here in pursuance of his will By the garter in which one of the coats of arms is included it is evident that the tomb was erected by the founder of the chapel This also directs us to the origin of lord  Wenlock  It is most likely that his father was related to this prebend and that he left his possessions to him and that lord  Wenlock  in the height of his prosperity paid this ostentatious compliment to the memory of his kinsman  IN the middle is an altartomb of shellmarble with the brass plate of a woman  IN the wall beneath two arches are the tombs I think of the

marks and kept in their own hands till they were compelled to appoint a vicar The purchase was in the time of abbot  Robert  Chauncy    It appears that this place  Houghton  and  Potesgrave  had been bestowed on the monastery for the support of the kitchen for the guests This is seen in the charter of con∣firmation made by king  John  in the first year of his reign  Dugdale Man  i  Henry  I had confirmed the same In his charter the names are misspelt See  Chauncy      The church is dedicated to St  Mary  and is a vicarage in the gift of the earl of  Bute  Luton Ho  the seat of that nobleman

unfortunately denied to me I must therefore relate the antient story of the favored spot In the twentieth of  Edward  I it was possessed by  Robert  Chauncy    who took the addition of  de Hoo  from the place which signifies a high situ∣ation His grandson  Thomas  was created lord  Hoo  and  Hastings  by  Henry  VI in He if no mistake is made in the ac∣count settled two parts of the tithes on the abbey of  St Alban's  for the use of strangers Lord  Hoo  left only daughters From one who married Sir  Geofry Bullen  was descended queen  Eliza∣beth  I do not discover the time in which the tower in  Luton Park  was built It is an antient structure of flint and  Tottenhoe  stone intermixed  ABOUT two miles to the northeast of  Luton Hoo  SOMMERIS  is the village of  Sommeris  where as  Leland  informs us lord  Wenlock  had begun sumptuously a house but never finished it that the gatehouse of brick was very fair and large The gateway and part of a tower are yet to be seen In the last are fourteen or fifteen brick steps and there was originally a hole or rather pipe which conveyed the lowest whisper from bottom to top Part of this and of the other building was pulled down by Sir  John Napier  about forty years ago  Leland  also acquaints us that these estates of lord  Wenlock  passed by marriage of an heir general  Leland  vi  of his to a relation of  Thomas Scot  alias  Rotherham  archbishop of  York  from to a prelate remarkable for nepotism and the prefer∣ment of his kindred by marriage and other ways  Goodwin Pros Angl    This family assumed the name of  Rotherham  and

 and  Hastings  about the latter end of the reign of  Henry  VI when it devolved to his three daughters  Chauncy    The manor was sold soon after their marriages to  Matthew Cressy  in the time of  Edward  IV It continued in his line till the reign of queen  Elizabeth  when by the marriage of a female descendant it fell to the  Bardolfs Richard Bardolf  sold it to Sir  John Witherong  created

by  Edgar  on the monastery of  Ely  At the time of the Conquest it was found to be in the possession of that great house in which it continued till that abbey was converted into a bishopric in the reign of  Henry  I It then became one of the resi∣dences of the prelates for they had not fewer than ten palaces be∣longing to the see  Bentham's Ely    and from that was called  Bishop's Halfield  to distinguish it from other places of the same name It probably fell into decay during the long wars between the houses of  York  and  Lancaster  for I find it was rebuilt and ornamented by bishop  Morton  in the reign of  Henry  VII  Ib  Among the shameful alienations made from the bishopric of  Ely  by queen  Elizabeth  by virtue of the imprudent statute which gave her power of ex∣changes over all must be included the manor of  Hatfield  The palace had at times been an occasional royal residence notwith∣standing it was the property of the church  William  second son of  Edward  III was born here in and was called from that circumstance  William  of  Hatfield  Queen  Elizabeth  resided here many years before she came to the crown  See the curious account of the practices of the lord

do the same She died in the convent of the  Cordeliers  in  Avignon April  th he in in  Italy  his native country to which he had retired after the loss of  Laura  Her age was probably about forty his

inhabitant of  Vaucluse  but it ap∣pears in a less amiable form attended with high rank and great austerity Her virtues were of a nature fitted for the praise of bishop  Fisher  not for the sweet pen of the elegant  Petrarch Margaret  countess of  Richmond  did not pique herself to far virtuous as she was as to carry her passion for a single object to the grave The pious prelate gravely tells you that she accepted her first husband  Edmund  duke of  Richmond  at the  instance of St  Nicholas  patron of virgins who appeared to her in a dream We are not told at whose recommendation she took Sir  Henry Stafford  and  Thomas  earl of  Derby  for she liked the state matrimonial so well as afterwards to accept both their hands She signalized herself during life by her piety charity hu∣mility and chastity The first appeared in her rigorous attendance on the duties of the church and her admittance into the fraternity of five religious houses the second in her noble foundations of  Christ College  and that of  St John  in  Cambridge  besides a number of other great deeds of charity the third in her declaration that  if the princes of  Christendom  would undertake a crusade she would chearfully be the laundress of the army  and then for her chastity in her last husband's days she obtained a licence from him to live chaste and took the vow of celibacy from bishop  Fisher  's hands

antient lords as early as the time of king  Stephen  Salmon's Herts    The  Mores  afterwards possessed it for some generations Sir  John  the father of the celebrated Sir  Tho∣mas More  owned it in the reign of  Henry  VII and it became the residence of that illustrious character till the time of his cruel sacrifice when the son was stripped of every part of his fortune by the most arbitrary attainders It reverted again to the fa∣mily but the grandson of Sir  Thomas  being ruined by the civil wars sold it to Sir  Edward Desbovery  It afterwards passed by sale to Mr  Pitchford  and to Sir  Jeremiah Sambroke  From his sisters it devolved to Mr  Freeman  of  Hammels  and was after∣wards sold to the present owner Mr  Hunter  NOT far from a place called  Potters Bar  probably from some pottery such as is still carried on at  Woodside  about two  miles to the north on the same road I entered the coun∣ty of MIDDLESEX kept along the edge of  Enfield Chace  This chace was inclosed by act of parliament and of the acres whereof it consisted were appropriated to the use of the Crown and the re∣sidue divided between the four adjoining parishes of  Enfield Edmonton Hadley  and  South Mims  to  Hadley  passed through  Cheping Barnet  and in less than a mile beyond quitted the great road at  Pricklers Hill  again skirted the  Chace  descended  Winch∣more Hill  and concluded the

account of it in my  Welsh Tour  vol ii p  which on the north edge of this parish for some yards as till lately at  Islington  is conveyed in a trough of wood lined with lead called  The Boarded River  over a brick arch fifteen feet high was the first object of my attention  I NEXT visited the antient brick house called  Enfield Palace  built by Sir  Thomas Lovel  knight of the Garter and privy coun∣sellor to  Henry  VII where he died in  Camden  i  It is conjec∣tured that  Henry  VIII bought it for a nursery for his children  See the  Antiquarian Repertory  ii where a print of this palace is given It is now divided into several dwellings  Here  Edward  VI received the first news of his father's death and his own accession On the chimneypiece of the great parlour are the arms of  England  in a Garter supported by a Lion and a  Griffin on the sides the Rose and Portcullis crowned with E R beneath These initials are also on the stucco in front of the house  QUEEN  Elizabeth  used sometimes to make this place a visit  Robert Cary  earl of  Monmouth  informs us he once waited on her Highness at this place where she went to take a dinner and had toiles set up in the park to shoot at bucks after she had dined  His  Memoirs  d edit p    IN the time of the great plague in a very flourishing school was kept here by Mr  Uvedale  That gentleman was very fond of gardening and

his title descended to him from his father Sir  John Tiptoft  The house was rebuilt on higher ground  by Sir  Nicholas Raynton  knight lord mayor of  London  in  who died in and has a splendid monument in  Enfield  church The place is now owned by  Eliab Breton  Esquire who married a coheiress of the  Raynton  and  Wolstenholme  families  UNDER the conduct of my friend before mentioned I made a visit to  Waltham Abbey  seated in ESSEX about three miles from  Enfield  on the west side of the river  Lea  I past by  Waltham Cross  WALTHAM CROSS  one of the affectionate memorials of  Edward  I towards his beloved queen  Eleanor  The cross is in excellent preservation and richly adorned with gothic sculpture This tract is a rich flat of verdant meadows watered by the  Lea  and bounded on each side by gentle risings The meads belonging to the abbey are distinguished by the name of  Halifield  or  The holy field  THE present church of  Waltham  is only the nave of the antient structure  CHURCH  which was in form of a cross with a central tower which fell down after the dissolution and the new tower was built at one end Within are six massy pillars some carved with spiral others with zigzag furrows like those of the nave of  Durham  cathedral The arches are round above them two rows of galleries in what is called the  Saxon  stile At the east end remains one vast round arch of the tower  THE only monuments of any note are those of the  Dennies  That of Sir  Edward Denny  and  Joan  his wife has on it their figures in a reclined posture he in armour and in front are the figures of six of their sons and four of their daughters kneel∣ing Sir  Edward  was of the privy chamber to queen  Elizabeth  governor of  Kerry  and  Desmonde  and colonel of some  Irish  forces He died in aged about fiftytwo and I hope merited this eulogy inscribed on the tomb  Learn carious reader how you pass  Your once Sir  Edward Denny  was  A courtier of the chamber  A soldier of the field  Whose tongue could never flatter  Whose heart could never yealde  THE tombs of earl  Harold  founder of the abbey of the famous  Hugo Nevill  who slew a lion in the Holy Land and of several others are now lost having perished with the fall of the tower on the eastern part of the church in which they were placed  Weever      THE abbey stood near the church Its only remains are a gate and postern with the arms of  England  in the time of  Henry  III part of a cloister and an elliptic bridge over the moat The edifice was pulled down after the dissolution and the materials applied to building a mansion by Sir  Anthony Denny  father of Sir  Edward  to whom the place had been granted by  Edward  VI His lady afterwards purchased the re∣version in see of  Waltham  manor from the same prince for be∣tween three and four thousand pounds with several large pri∣vileges in the adjoining forest  Fuller's Hist Waltham Abbey    This and the great estate of the family passed afterwards to the luxurious  Hay  earl of  Carlisle  by his marriage with the heiress of  Edward Denny  earl of  Norwich  grandson of Sir  Anthony  The fortune was soon dis∣sipated and the estate sold by their heirs to Sir  Samuel Jones  of  Northamptonshire  who gave it to the  Wakes  and it is at present owned by Sir  William Wake  baronet  THE abbey was founded in  ABBEY  by earl  Harold  afterwards king  of  England  It might more properly be stiled a college being supplied by a dean and eleven secular black canons who were excellently provided for the dean having six manors and each canon one A copy of the charter of confirmation by  Edward  the Confessor is preserved by Sir  William Dugdale  Monast  ii    AFTER the battle of  Hastings Githa  the mother of  Harold  and  Osegod  and  Ailric  by their prayers and tears moved the Con∣queror to deliver to them the corpse of the  Saxon  monarch and of his brethren  Girth  and  Leofwin  to be interred here  Harold  's tomb was of rich grey marble

abbots  Richard  I be∣stowed the lands on  Richard FitzAuchor  to hold them in see and hereditarily of the abbey He fixed himself at this seat At  length the abbot became possessed of it and retained it till the dissolution Queen  Elizabeth  granted it to Sir  Thomas Heneage  His daughter afterwards countess of  Winchelsea  sold it to the earl of  Middlesex  in the reign of  James  I  Charles  earl of  Dorset  sold it in to  Thomas Webster  Esquire created Baronet in and he sold it to  Edward Conyers  Esquire of  Waltham∣stow  whose grandson  John  is the present possessor  The late Mr  Conyers  took down the old house of which a print may be seen in  Farmer's History of Waltham Abbey  and built the present on a higher site about thirty years ago The beautiful east window in St  Margaret  's church at  Westminster  came originally from the chapel of this old mansion    RETURNING the same way over the  Lea  I could not but re∣flect on the different appearance this tract made

love with the place obtained it from  Cecil  in exchange for  Hatfield  enlarged the park and inclosed it with a brick wall ten miles in circuit The place was resigned to the king and queen on the d of  May  A poetical entertainment was made on the occasion by  Ben Jonson  and suitable scenery invented in all probability by  Inigo Jones  Tour in Wales  ii  The Genius of the place is at first very

and finished his days here in In the greatest part of this magnificent place so particularly described by  Heutzner  was pulled down and the plunder given to the soldiers The small remains such as the room in which the king died and a portico with the painting of the genealogical tree of the house of  Cecil  were demolished in by the present owner  George Prescot  Esquire who leased out the site to a builder and built himself a handsome house a mile south of it so that the memory of it is only preserved by the picture in possession of earl  Poulet  at  Hinton St George  and the description from

SOMERSET See p  HER death was infamous and though she died as it were in a corner in so private a condition the loathsomeness of her death made it as conspicuous as on a housetop for that part of her body which had been the re∣ceptacle of most of her sin grown rotten though she never had but one child the ligaments failing it fell down and was cut away in flakes with a most nauseous and putrid savour which to augment she would roll herself in her own ordure in her bed took delight in it Thus her affections varied for nothing could be found sweet enough to augment her beauties at first and nothing stinking enough to decypher her loath∣someness at last Pardon the sharpness of these expressions for they are for the glory of God who often makes his pu∣nishments in the balance of his
