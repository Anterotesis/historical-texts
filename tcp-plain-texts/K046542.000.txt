 Village Courtship  YOUNG Roger came tapping at Dolly's window  Thumpaty thumpaty thump  He begg'd for admittance she answer'd him No  Glumpaty glumpaty glump  My DOLLY my dear your true Love is here  Dumpaty dumpaty dump  No no ROGER noas you came you may go  Slumpaty slumpaty slump  Oh then she recall'd and recall'd him again  Humpaty humpaty hump  Whilst he like a madman ran over the plain  Slumpaty slumpaty slump  Oh what is the reason dear DOLLY he cry'd  Humpaty humpaty hump  That thus I'm cast off and unkindly deny'd  Trumpaty trumpaty trump  Some rival more dear I guess has been here  Crumpaty crumpaty crump  Suppose there's been two Sir what's that to you Sir  Numpaty Numpaty nump  Oh then with a sigh his sad farewell he took  Humpaty humpaty hump  And quite in despair he leap'd into the brook  Plumpaty plumpaty plump  His courage he cool'd he found himself fool'd  Mumpaty mumpaty mump  He swam to the shore and saw DOLLY no more  Rumpaty rumpaty rump  Determin'd to find a damsel more kind  Plumpaty plumpaty plump  While DOLLY's afraid she must die an old maid  Mumpaty mumpaty mump  FOWLER PRINTER SALISBURY
