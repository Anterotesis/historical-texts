 THE DRUMMER OR THE HAUNTED HOUSE A COMEDY As it is Acted at the  TheatreRoyal  in  DruryLane  BY His MAJESTY's Servants  Falsis terroribus implet  Ut Magus  Hor  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  at  Shakespear  's  Head  overagainst  KatharineStreet  in the  Strand  MDCCXV  THE PREFACE  HAving recommended this Play to the Town and delivered the Copy of it to the Bookseller I think my self oblig'd to give some Account of it  It had been some Years in the Hands of the Author and falling under my Perusal I thought so well of it that I persuaded him to make a few Additions and Alterations to it and let it appear upon the Stage I own I was very highly pleased with it and lik'd it the better for the want of those studyed Similes and Repartees which we who have writ before him have thrown into our Plays to indulge and gain upon a false Taste that has prevailed for many Years in the  British  Theatre I believe the Author would have fallen into this Way a little more than he has had he before the writing of it been often present at Theatrical Representations and observ'd the Effect that such Ornaments generally have upon the Town I was confirmed in my Thoughts of the Play by the Opinion of better Judges to whom it was Communicated who observed that the Scenes were written very much after  Moliere  's Manner and that an easie and natural Vein of Humour ran through the whole  I do not question but the Reader will discover this and see many Beauties that escape the Audience the Touches  being too delicate for every Taste in a Popular Assembly My BrotherSharers were of Opinion at the first reading of it that it was like a Picture in which the Strokes were not strong enough to appear with Advantage at a Distance As it is not in the common way of Writing the Approbation was at first Doubtful but has risen every time it has been Acted and has given an Opportunity in several of its Parts for as just and good Action as I ever saw on the Stage  The Reader will consider that I speak here as the Patentee for which Reason I forbear being more particular in the Character of this Play least I should appear like one who cries up the Wares of his own Shop to draw in Customers  Richard Steele  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr  Wilks    IN this Grave Age when Comedies are few  We crave your Patronage for one that's New  Tho' 'twere poor Stuff yet bid the Author fair  And let the Scarceness recommend the Ware  Long have your Ears been fill'd with Tragick Parts  Blood and BlankVerse have harden'd all your Hearts  If e'er you smile 'tis at some PartyStroaks  Roundheads  and  Woodenshooes  are standing Jokes  The same Conceit gives Claps and Hisses Birth  You're grown such Politicians in your Mirth  For once we try tho' 'tis I own unsafe  To please you All and make both Parties laugh  Our Author anxious for his Fame to Night  And bashful in his First Attempt to write  Lies cautiously obscure and unreveal'd  Like Ancient Actors in a Masque conceal'd  Cen  re when no Man knows who writes the Play  Were much good Malice merely thrown away  The mighty Criticks will not blast for Shame  A raw young Thing who dares not tell his Name  Goodnatur'd Judges will th' unknown defend  And fear to blame least they shou'd hurt a Friend  Each Wit may praise it for his own dear Sake  And hint He writ it if the Thing shou'd take  But if you're rough and use him like a Dog  Depend upon itHe'll remain Incog  If you shou'd hiss he swears He'll hiss as high  And like a Culprit joyn the HueandCry  If Cruel Men are still averse to spare  These Scenes they fly for Refuge to the Fair  Tho' with a Ghost our Comedy be heighten'd  Ladies upon my Word you shan't be frighten'd  O 'tis a Ghost that scorns to be uncivil  A wellspread lusty Jointurehunting Devil  An Am'rous Ghost that's faithful fond and true  Made up of Flesh and Bloodas much as you  Then every Evening come in Flocks undaunted  We never think this House is too much Haunted  Dramatis Personae  Sir

Coach to Town last Night that brought a Gentleman to enquire about this strange Noise we hear in the House This Spirit will bring a power of Custom to the  George  If so be he continues his Pranks I design to sell a Pot of Ale and set up the Sign of the Drum  Coach  I'll give Madam warning that's flatI've always liv'd in Sober Families I'll not disparage my self to be a Servant in a House that is haunted  Gard  I'll e'en marry  Nell  and rent a bit of Ground of my own if both of you leave Madam not but that Madam's a very good Womanif Mrs  Abigal  did not spoil hercome here's her Health  But  It's a very hard thing to be a Butler in a House that is disturb'd He made such a Racket in the Cellar last Night that I'm afraid he'll sower all the Beer in my Barrels  Coach  Why then  John  we ought to take it off as fast as we can Here's to youHe rattled so loud under the Tiles last Night that I verily thought the House wou'd have fallen over our Heads I durst not go up into the CockLoft this Morning if I had not got one of the Maids to go along with me  Gard  I thought I heard him in one of my BedPostsI marvel  John  how he gets into the House when all the Gates are shut  But  Why look ye  Peter  your Spirit will creep you into an AugreHolehe'll whisk ye through a KeyHole without so much as justling against one of the Wards  Coach  Poor Madam is mainly frighted that's certain and verily believes 'tis my Master that was kill'd in the last Campaign  But  Out of all manner of Question  Robin  'tis Sir  George  Mrs  Abigal  is of Opinion it can be none but his Honour he always lov'd the Wars and you know was mightily pleas'd from a Child with the Musick of a Drum  Gard  I wonder his Body was never found after the Battle  But  Found Why ye Fool is not his Body here about the House Dost thou think he can beat his Drum without Hands and Arms  Coach  'Tis Master as sure as I stand here alive and I verily believe I saw him last Night in the TownClose  Gard  Ay how did he appear  Coach  Like a WhiteHorse  But  Pho  Robin  I tell ye he has never appear'd yet but in the Shape of the Sound of a Drum  Coach  This makes one almost afraid of one's own Shadow As I was walking from the Stable t'other Night without my Lanthorn I fell across a Beam that lay in my way and Faith my Heart was in my MouthI thought I had stumbled over a Spirit  But  Thou might'st as well have stumbled over a Straw why a Spirit is such a little little Thing that I have heard a Man who was a great Scholar say that he'll dance ye a  Lancashire  HornPipe upon the point of a NeedleAs I sat in the Pantry last Night counting my Spoons the Candle methought burnt blue and the spay'd Bitch look'd as if she saw something  Coach  Ay poor Cur she's almost frighten'd out of her Wits  Gard  Ay I warrant ye she hears him many a time and often when we don't  But  My Lady must have him Laid that's certain whatever it cost her  Gard  I fancy when one goes to Market one might hear of some body that can make a Spell  Coach  Why may not the Parson of our Parish lay him  But  No no no our Parson cannot lay him  Coach  Why not he as well as another Man  But  Why ye Fool he is not qualifiedHe has not taken the Oaths  Gard  Why d'ye think  John  that the Spirit wou'd take the Law of himfaith I cou'd tell you one way to drive him off  Coach  How's that  Gard  I'll tell you immediately  drinks  I fancy Mrs  Abigal  might Scold him out of the House  Coach  Ay she has a Tongue that would drown his Drum if any thing cou'd  But  Pugh this is all froth you understand nothing of the Matterthe next time it makes a Noise I tell you what ought to be doneI wou'd have the Steward speak Latin to it  Coach  Ay that wou'd do if the Steward had but Courage  Gard  There you have itHe's a fearful Man If I had as much Learning as he and I met the Ghost I'd tell him his own but alack what can one of us poor Men do with a Spirit that can neither Write nor Read  But  Thou art always cracking and boasting  Peter  thou dost not know what Mischief it might do thee if such a silly Dog as thee should offer to speak to it For ought I know he might flea thee alive and make Parchment of thy Skin to cover his Drum with  Gard  A Fidlestick tell not meI fear nothing not I I never did harm in my Life I never committed Murder  But  I verily believe thee keep thy Temper  Peter  after Supper we'll drink each of us a double Mug and then let come what will  Gard  Why that's well said  John  an honest Man that is not quite sober has nothing to fearHere's to yewhy how if he shou'd come this Minute here wou'd I stand Ha what Noise is that  But Coach  Ha where  Gard  The Devil the Devil Oh no 'tis Mrs  Abigal    But  Ay faith 'tis she 'tis Mrs  Abigal  a good Mistake 'tis Mrs  Abigal    Enter  Abigal  Ab  Here are your drunken Sots for you Is this a time to be guzling when Gentry are come to the House why don't You lay your Cloth How come You out of the Stables Why are not You at work in your Garden  Gard  Why yonder's the fine  Londoner  and Madam fetching a walk together and methought they look'd as if they should say they had rather have my Room than my Company  But  And so forsooth being all three mettogether we are doing our Endeavours to drink this same Drummer out of our Heads  Gard  For you must know Mrs  Abigal  we are all of Opinion that one can't be a Match for him unless one be as Drunk as a Drum  Coach  I am resolved to give Madam Warning to hire herself another Coachman for I came to serve my Master d'ye see while he was alive but do suppose that he has no further occasion for a Coach now he Walks  But  Truly Mrs  Abigal  I must needs say that this same Spirit is a very odd sort of a Body after all to fright Madam and his old Servants at this rate  Gard  And truly Mrs  Abigal  I must needs say I serv'd my my Master contentedly while he was living but I will serve no Man living that is no Man that is not living without double Wages  Ab  Ay 'tis such Cowards as you that go about with Idle Stories to disgrace the House and bring so many Strangers about it you first frighten your selves and then your Neighbours  Gard  Frighten'd I scorn your Words Frighten'd quotha  Ab  What you Sot are you grown Potvaliant  Gard  Frighten'd with a Drum that's a good one it will do us no harm I'll answer for it It will bring no Bloodshed along with it take my Word It sounds as like a TrainBand Drum as ever I heard in my Life  But  Prithee  Peter  don't be so presumptuous  Ab  Well these drunken Rogues take it as I cou'd wish  Aside  Gard  I scorn to be frightned now I am in for't if old  Dubadub  shou'd come into the Room I wou'd take him  But  Prithee hold thy Tongue  Gard  I would take him  The Drum beats the  Gard  endeavours to get off and falls  But Coach  Speak to it Mrs  Abigal    Gard  Spare my Life and take all I have  Coach  Make off make off good Butler and let us go hide our selves in the Cellar  They all run off  Abigal  Sola  Ab  So now the Coast is clear I may venture to call out my DrummerBut first let me shut the Door lest we be surpriz'd Mr  Fantome  Mr  Fantome    He beats  Nay nay pray come out the Enemy's fledI must speak with you immediatelydon't stay to beat a Parley  The back Scene opens and discovers  Fantome  with a Drum  Fan  Dear Mrs  Nabby  I have overheard all that has been said and find thou hast manag'd this thing so well that I cou'd take thee in my Arms and kiss theeif my Drum did not stand in my way  Ab  Well O' my Conscience you are the merriest Ghost and the very Picture of Sir  George Truman    Fan  There you flatter me Mrs  Abigal  Sir  George  had that freshness in his Looks that we Men of the Town cannot come up to  Ab  Oh Death may have alter'd you you knowbesides you must consider you lost a great deal of Blood in the Battle  Fan  Ay that's right let me look never so pale this Cut cross my Forehead will keep me in Countenance  Ab  'Tis just such a one as my Master receiv'd from a cursed  French  Trooper as my Lady's Letter inform'd her  Fan  It happens luckily that this Suit of Cloaths of Sir  George  's fits me so wellI think I can't fail hitting the Air of a Man with whom I was so long acquainted  Ab  You are the very ManI vow I almost start when I look upon you  Fan  But what good will this do me if I must remain invisible  Ab  Pray what good did your being visible do you the fair Mr  Fantome  thought no Woman cou'd withstand himBut when you were seen by my Lady in your proper Person after she had taken a full survey of you and heard all the pretty things you cou'd say she very civilly dismiss'd you for the sake of this empty noisy Creature  Tinsel  She fancies you have been gone from hence this Fortnight  Fan  Why really I love thy Lady so well that tho' I had no hopes of gaining her for my self I cou'd not bear to see her given to another especially to such a Wretch as  Tinsel    Ab  Well tell me truly Mr  Fantome  have not you a great Opinion of my Fidelity to my dear Lady that I wou'd not suffer her to be deluded in this manner for less than a Thousand Pound  Fan  Thou art always reminding me of my Promisethou shalt have it if thou canst bring our Project to bear do'st not know that Stories of Ghosts and Apparitions generally end in a Pot of Money  Ab  Why truly now Mr  Fantome  I shou'd think my self a very bad Woman if I had done what I do for a Farthing less  Fan  Dear  Abigal  how I admire thy Virtue  Ab  No no Mr  Fantome  I defy the worst of my Enemies to say I love Mischief for Mischief sake  Fan  But is thy Lady perswaded that I am the Ghost of her deceased Husband  Ab  I endeavour to make her believe so and tell her every time your Drum rattles that her Husband is chiding her for entertaining this new Lover  Fan  Prithee make use of all thy Art for I am tir'd to Death with strowling round this wide Old House like a Rat behind a Wainscot  Ab  Did not I tell you 'twas the purest place in the World for you to play your Tricks in there's none of the Family that knows every Hole and Corner in it besides my self  Fan  Ah Mrs  Abigal  You have had your Intrigues  Ab  For you must know when I was a romping young Girl I was a mighty lover of  Hide and Seek    Fan  I believe by this Time I am as well acquainted with the House as your self  Ab  You are very much mistaken Mr  Fantome  but no matter for that here is to be your Station to Night This is the Place unknown to any one living besides my self since the Death of the Joyner who you must understand being a Lover of mine contriv'd the Wainscot to move to and fro in the manner that you find it I design'd it for a Wardrobe for my Lady's cast  Cloaths Oh the Stomachers Stays Pettycoats Commodes lac'd Shooes and good things that I have had in itpray take care you don't break the CherryBrandy Bottle that stands up in the Corner  Fan  Well Mrs  Abigal  I hire your Closet of you but for this one Nighta thousand Pound you know is a very good Rent  Ab  Well get you gone you have such a way with you there's no denying you any thing  Fan  I'm a thinking how  Tinsel  will stare when he sees me come out of the Wall for I am resolved to make my Appearance to Night  Ab  Get you in get you in my Lady's at the Door  Fan  Pray take care she does not keep me up so late as she did last Night or depend upon it I'll beat the Tattoo  Ab  I'm undone I'm undone  As he is going in  Mr  Fantome  Mr  Fantome  you have put the thousand Pound Bond into my Brother's Hands  Fan  Thou shalt have it I tell thee thou shalt have it    Fantome  goes in  Ab  No more WordsVanish Vanish  Enter  Lady  Ab  opening the Door  Oh dear Madam was it you that made such a knocking my Heart does so beatI vow you have frighted me to DeathI thought verily it had been the Drummer  Lady  I have been showing the Garden to Mr  Tinsel  he's most insufferably witty upon us about this Story of the Drum  Ab  Indeed Madam he's a very loose Man I'm afraid 'tis he that hinders my poor Master from resting in his Grave  Lady  Well an  Infidel  is such a Novelty in the Country that I am resolv'd to divert my self a Day or two at least with the Oddness of his Conversation  Ab  Ah Madam the Drum begun to beat in the House as soon as ever this Creature was admitted to visit you All the while Mr  Fantome  made his Addresses to you there was not a Mouse stirring in the Family more than us'd to be  Lady  This Baggage has some Design upon me more than I can yet discover  aside  Mr  Fantome  was always thy Favourite  Ab  Ay and shou'd have been yours too by my Consent Mr  Fantome  was not such a slight fantastick thing as this isMr  Fantome  was the bestbuilt Man one shou'd see in a Summer's Day Mr  Fantome  was a Man of Honour and lov'd you Poor Soul how has he sigh'd when he has talk'd to me of my hardhearted LadyWell I had as lief as a thousand Pound you wou'd marry Mr  Fantome  Lady  To tell theetruly I lov'd him well enough till I found he lov'd me so much But Mr  Tinsel  makes his Court to me with so much Neglect and Indifference and with such an agreeable SaucinessNot that I say I'll marry him  Ab  Marry him quotha no if you should you'll be awaken'd sooner than married Couples generally areYou'll quickly have a Drum at your Window  Lady  I'll hide my Contempt of  Tinsel  for once if it be but to see what this Wench drives at  Aside  Ab  Why suppose your Husband after this fair Warning he has given you shou'd sound you an Alarm at Midnight then open your Curtains with a Face as pale as my Apron and cry out with a hollow Voice What dost thou do in Bed with this Spindleshank'd Fellow  Lady  Why wilt thou needs have it to be my Husband he never had any reason to be offended at me I always lov'd him while he was living and shou'd prefer him to any Man were he so still Mr  Tinsel  is indeed very idle in his Talk but I fancy  Abigal  a discreet Woman might reform him  Ab  That's a likely matter indeed did you ever hear of a Woman who had Power over a Man when she was his Wife that had none while she was his Mistress Oh there's nothing in the World improves a Man in his Complaisance like Marriage  Lady  He is indeed at present too familiar in his Conversation  Ab  Familiar Madam in Troth he's downright rude  Lady  But that you know  Abigal  shows he has no Dissimulation in himThen he is apt to jest a little too much upon grave Subjects  Ab  Grave Subjects he jests upon the Church  Lady  But that you know  Abigal  may be only to show his WitThen it must be own'd he is extreamly Talkative  Ab  Talkative d'ye call it he's downright Impertinent  Lady  But that you know  Abigal  is a Sign he has been us'd to good CompanyThen indeed he is very positive  Ab  Positive Why he contradicts you in every thing you say  Lady  But then you know  Abigal  he has been educated at the Inns of Court  Ab  A blessed Education indeed it has made him forget his Catechism  Lady  You talk as if you hated him  Ab  You talk as if you lov'd him  Lady  Hold your Tongue here he comes  Enter  Tinsel  Tin  My dear Widow  Ab  My dear Widow marry come up  Aside  Lady  Let him alone  Abigal  so long as he does not call me My dear Wife there's no Harm done  Tin  I have been most ridiculously diverted since I left youYour Servants have made a Convert of my Booby His Head is so filled with this foolish Story of a Drummer that I expect the Rogue will be afraid hereafter to go upon a Message by Moonlight  Lady  Ah Mr  Tinsel  what a Loss of Billetdoux would that be to many a fine Lady  Ab  Then you still believe this to be a foolish Story I thought my Lady had told you that she had heard it her self  Tin  Ha ha ha  Ab  Why you would not perswade us out of our Senses  Tin  Ha ha ha  Ab  There's Manners for you Madam  Aside  Lady  Admirably rally'd that Laugh is unanswerable Now I'll be hang'd if you could forbear being witty upon me if I should tell you I heard it no longer ago than last Night  Tin  Fancy  Lady  But what if I should tell you my Maid was with me  Tin  Vapours Vapours Pray my dear Widow will you answer me one QuestionHad you ever this Noise of a Drum in your Head all the while your Husband was living  Lady  And pray Mr  Tinsel  will you let me ask you another Question Do you think we can Hear in the Country as well as you do in Town  Tin  Believe me Madam I could prescribe you a Cure for these Imaginations  Ab  Don't tell my Lady of Imaginations Sir I have heard it my self  Tin  Hark thee Childart thou not an old Maid  Ab  Sir if I am it is my own Fault  Tin  Whims Freaks Megrims indeed Mrs  Abigal    Ab  Marry Sir by your Talk one would believe you thought every thing that was good is a Megrim  Lady  Why truly I don't very well understand what you meant by your Doctrine to me in the Garden just now that every thing we saw was made by Chance  Ab  A very pretty Subject indeed for a Lover to divert his Mistress with  Lady  But I suppose that was only a Taste of the Conversation you would entertain me with after Marriage  Tin  Oh I shall then have time to read you such Lectures of Motions Atoms and Naturethat you shall learn to think as Freely as the best of us and be convinced in less than a Month that all about us is Chancework  Lady  You are a very complaisant Person indeed and so you would make your Court to me by perswading me that I was made by Chance  Tin  Ha ha ha well said my Dear why faith thou wert a very lucky Hit that's certain  Lady  Pray Mr  Tinsel  where did you learn this odd way of talking  Tin  Ah Widow 'tis your Country Innocence makes you think it an odd way of talking  Lady  Tho' you give no Credit to Stories of Apparitions I hope you believe there are such things as Spirits  Tin  Simplicity  Ab  I fancy you don't believe Women have Souls d'ye Sir  Tin  Foolish enough  Lady  I vow Mr  Tinsel  I'm afraid malicious People will say I'm in Love with an Atheist  Tin  Oh my Dear that's an oldfashion'd WordI'm a Freethinker Child  Ab  I am sure you are a Freespeaker  Lady  Really Mr  Tinsel  considering that you are so fine a Gentleman I'm amaz'd where you got all this Learning I wonder it has not spoil'd your Breeding  Tin  To tell you the Truth I have not time to look into these dry Matters my self but I am convinc'd by four or five learned Men whom I sometimes overhear at a Coffeehouse I frequent that our Forefathers were a Pack of Asses that the World has been in an Error for some Thousands of Years and that all the People upon Earth excepting those two or three worthy Gentlemen are impos'd upon cheated bubbled abus'd bamboozl'd  Ab  Madam how can you hear such a Profligate he talks like the  London  Prodigal  Lady  Why really I'm a thinking if there be no such things as Spirits a Woman has no Occasion for marryingShe need not be afraid to lye by her self  Tin  Ah my Dear are Husbands good for nothing but to frighten away Spirits Dost thou think I could not instruct thee in several other Comforts of Matrimony  Lady  Ah but you are a Man of so much Knowledge that you would always be laughing at my IgnoranceYou learned Men are so apt to despise one  Tin  No Child I'd teach thee my Principles thou should'st be as wise as I amin a Week's time  Lady  Do you think your Principles would make a Woman the better Wife  Tin  Prithee Widow don't be queer  Lady  I love a gay Temper but I would not have you rally things that are serious  Tin  Well enough faith where's the Jest of rallying any thing else  Ab  Ah Madam did you ever hear Mr  Fantome  talk at this Rate  Aside  Tin  But where's this Ghost this Son of a Whore of a Drummer I'd fain hear him methinks  Ab  Pray Madam don't suffer him to give the Ghost such ill Language especially when you have Reason to believe it is my Master  Tin  That's well enough faith  Nab  dost thou think thy Master is so unreasonable as to continue his Claim to his Relict  after his Bones are laid Pray Widow remember the Words of your Contract you have fulfill'd them to a TittleDid not you marry Sir  George  to the Tune of  'till Death us do part  Lady  I must not hear Sir  George  's Memory treated in so slight a MannerThis Fellow must have been at some Pains make himself such a finish'd Coxcomb  Aside  Tin  Give me but Possession of your Person and I'll whirle you up to Town for a Winter and cure you at once Oh I have known many a Country Lady come to  London  with frightful Stories of the HallHouse being haunted of Fairies Spirits and Witches that by the time she had seen a Comedy play'd at an Assembly and ambled in a Ball or two has been so little afraid of Bugbears that she has ventur'd home in a Chair at all Hours of the Night  Ab  HumSaucebox  Aside  Tin  'Tis the Solitude of the Country that creates these Whimsies there was never such a thing as a Ghost heard of at  London  except in the PlayhouseOh we'd pass all our time in  London  'Tis the Scene of Pleasure and Diversions where there's something to amuse you every Hour of the Day Life's not Life in the Country  Lady  Well then you have an Opportunity of showing the Sincerity of that Love to me which you profess You may give a Proof that you have an Affection to my Person not my Jointure  Tin  Your Jointure How can you think me such a Dog But Child won't your Jointure be the same thing in  London  as in the Country  Lady  No you're deceiv'd You must know it is settled on me by MarriageArticles on Condition that I live in this old MansionHouse and keep it up in Repair  Tin  How  Ab  That's well put Madam  Tin  Why faith I have been looking upon this House and think it is the prettiest Habitation I ever saw in my Life  Lady  Ay but then this cruel Drum  Tin  Something so venerable in it  Lady  Ay but the Drum  Tin  For my part I like this  Gothick  Way of Building better than any of your new Ordersit wou'd be a thousand pities it shou'd fall to Ruin  Lady  Ay but the Drum  Tin  How pleasantly we two could pass our Time in this delicious Situation Our Lives wou'd be a continued Dream of Happiness Come faith Widow let's go upon the Leads and take a View of the Country  Lady  Ay but the Drum the Drum  Tin  My Dear take my Word for't 'tis all Fancy Besides shou'd he drum in thy very BedChamber I shou'd only hug thee the closer  Clasp'd in the Folds of Love I'd meet my Doom  And act my Joys tho' Thunder shook the Room

Your Faithful Friend  G Truman  PS  Let this be a Secret and you shall find your Account in it  This amazeth me and yet the Reasons why I should believe he is still living are manifoldFirst Because this has often been the Case of other Military Adventurers  Secondly Because the News of his Death was first publish'd in  Dier  's  Letter    Thirdly Because this Letter can be written by none but himselfI know his Hand and manner of Spelling  Fourthly  Enter  Butler  But  Sir here's a strange old Gentleman that asks for you he says he's a Conjurer but he looks very suspicious I wish he ben't a

that she must never expect to find a second Sir  G Truman  meaning your Honour  Sir G  I think she lov'd me but I must search into this Story of the  Drummer  before I discover my self to her I have put on this Habit of a Conjurer in order to introduce my self It must be your Business to recommend me as a most profound Person that by my great Knowledge in the curious Arts can silence the  Drummer  and dispossess the House  Vel  I am going to lay my Accounts before my Lady and I will endeavour to prevail upon her Honour to admit the Tryal of your Art  Sir G  I have scarce heard of any of these Stories that did not arise from a Love IntrigueAmours raise as many Ghosts as Murders  Vel  Mrs  Abigal  endeavours to perswade us that 'tis your Honour who troubles the House  Sir G  That convinces me 'tis a Cheat for I think  Vellum  I may be pretty well assur'd it is not me  Vel  I am apt to think so truly Hahaha  Sir G  Abigal  had always an Ascendant over her Lady and if there is a Trick in this Matter depend upon it she is at the Bottom of it I'll be hang'd if this Ghost be not one of  Abigal  's Familiars  Vel  Mrs  Abigal  has of late been very mysterious  Sir G  I fancy  Vellum  thou

Abigal  was never deaf to me when I talked upon that Subject I will take an Opportunity of addressing my self to her in the most pathetick Manner  Sir G  In the mean time lock me up in your Office and bring me word what Success you haveWell sure I am the first that ever was employ'd to lay himself  Vel  You act indeed a threefold Part in this House you are a Ghost a Conjurer and my Honoured Master

Business  Mimicking him  You will remember  Vellum  your Commission is twofold first to gain Admission for me to your Lady and secondly to get the Secret out of  Abigal    Vel  It sufficeth  The Scene shuts  Enter Lady  sola  Lady  Women who have been happy in a first Marriage are the most apt to venture upon a second But for my part I had a Husband so every way suited to my Inclinations that I must entirely forget him before I can like another Man I have now been a Widow but fourteen Months and have had twice as many Lovers all of 'em profest Admirers of my Person but passionately in love with my Jointure I think it is a Revenge I owe my Sex to make an Example of this worthless Tribe of Fellows who grow impudent dress themselves fine and fancy we are oblig'd to provide for 'em But of all my Captives Mr  Tinsel  is the most extraordinary in his kind I hope the Diversion I give my self with him is unblameable I'm sure 'tis necessary to turn my Thoughts off from the Memory of that dear Man who has been the greatest Happiness and Affliction of my Life My Heart would be a Prey to Melancholy if I did not find these innocent Methods of relieving it But here comes  Abigal  I must teaze the Baggage for I find she has taken it into her Head that I am entirely at her Disposal  Enter  Abigal  Ab  Madam Madam yonder's Mr  Tinsel  has as good as taken Possession of your House Marry he says he must have Sir  George  's Apartment enlarg'd for truly says he I hate to be straiten'd Nay he was so impudent as to shew me the Chamber where he intends to consummate as he calls it  Lady  Well he's a wild Fellow  Ab  Indeed he's a very sad Man Madam  Lady  He's young  Abigal  'tis a thousand Pities he should be lost I should be mighty glad to reform him  Ab  Reform him marry hang him  Lady  Has not he a great deal of Life  Ab  Ay enough to make your Heart ake  Lady  I dare say thou think'st him a very agreeable Fellow  Ab  He thinks himself so I'll answer for him  Lady  He's very goodnatur'd  Ab  He ought to be so for he's very silly  Lady  Dost thou think he loves me  Ab  Mr  Fantome  did I am sure  Lady  With what Raptures he talk'd  Ab  Yes but 'twas in Praise of your JointureHouse  Lady  He has kept bad Company  Ab  They must be very bad indeed if they were worse than himself  Lady  I have a strong Fancy a good Woman might reform him  Ab  It wou'd be a fine Experiment if it shou'd not succeed  Lady  Well  Abigal  we'll talk of that another time here comes the Steward I have no further Occasion for you at present  Exit  Abigal  Enter  Vellum  Vel  Madam is your Honour at Leisure to look into the Accounts of the last Week They rise very highHousekeeping is chargeable in a House that is haunted  Lady  How comes that to pass I hope the Drum neither eats nor drinks But read your Account  Vellum    Vel  putting on and off his Spectacles in this Scene  A Hogshead and a Half of Aleit is not for the Ghost's DrinkingBut your Honour's Servants say they must have something to keep up their Courage against this strange Noise They tell me they expect a double Quantity of Malt in their SmallBeer so long as the House continues in this Condition  Lady  At this rate they'll take care to be frighten'd all the Year round I'll answer for 'em But go on  Vel  Item  Two Sheep and aWhere is the OxOh here I have himand an OxYour Honour must always have a Piece of

BeerThey must have Drink with their Meat  Lady  Sure no Woman in  England  has a Steward that makes such ingenious Comments on his Works  Aside  Vel  Item  to Mr  Tinsel  's Servants five Bottles of Port WineIt was by your Honour's Order  Item  three Bottles of Sack for the use of Mrs  Abigal    Lady  I suppose that was by Your own Order  Vel  We have been long Friends we are your Honour's Ancient Servants Sack is an Innocent Cordial and gives her Spirit to chide the Servants when they are tardy in their Bus'ness he he he pardon me for being Jocular  Lady  Well I see you'll come together at last  Vel  Item  a dozen Pound of WatchLights for the Use of the Servants  Lady  For the Use of the Servants What are the Rogues afraid of sleeping in the Dark What an unfortunate Woman am I This is such a particular Distress it puts me to my Wits End  Vellum  what wou'd you advise me to do  Vel  Madam your Honour has two Points to consider  Imprimis  To retrench these Extravagant Expences which so many Strangers bring upon you  Secondly  To clear the House of this Invisible Drummer  Lady  This learned Division leaves me just as wise as I was But how must we bring these two Points to bear  Vel  I beseech your Honour to give me the hearing  Lady  I do But prithee take pity on me and be not tedious  Vel  I will be concise There is a certain Person arrived this Morning an aged Man of a venerable Aspect and of a long hoary Beard that reacheth down to his Girdle The common People call him a Wizard a WhiteWitch a Conjurer a CunningMan a Necromancer a  Lady  No matter for his Titles But what of all this  Vel  Give me the hearing good my Lady he pretends to great Skill in the Occult Sciences and is come hither upon the rumor of this  Drum  If one may believe him he knows the Secret of laying Ghosts or of quieting Houses that are haunted  Lady  Pho these are Idle Stories to amuse the Country People this can do us no good  Vel  It can do us no harm my Lady  Lady  I dare say thou do'st not believe there is any thing in it thy self  Vel  I cannot say I do there is no danger however in the Experiment Let him try his Skill if it shou'd succeed we are rid of the Drum if it shou'd not we may tell the World that it has and by that means at least get out of this Expensive way of living so that it must turn to your Advantage one way or another  Lady  I think you argue very rightly But where is the Man I would fain see him He must be a Curiosity  Vel  I have already discours'd him and he is to be with me in my Office half an Hour hence He asks nothing for his Pains till he has done his Workno Cure no Mony  Lady  That Circumstance I must confess wou'd make one believe there is more in his Art than one wou'd imagine Pray  Vellum  go and fetch him hither immediately  Vel  I am gone He shall be forthcoming forthwith  Exeunt  Enter  Butler Coachman  and  Gardiner  But  Rare News my Lads rare News  Gard  What's the Matter hast thou got any more Vales for us  But  No 'tis better than that  Coach  Is there another Stranger come to the House  But  Ay such a Stranger as will make all our Lives easy  Gard  What is he a Lord  But  A Lord No nothing like itHe's a Conjurer  Coach  A Conjurer what is he come a wooing to my Lady  But  No no you Fool he's come a purpose to lay the Spirit  Coach  Ay marry that's good News indeed But where is he  But  He's lock'd up with the Steward in his Office they are laying their Heads together very close I fancy they are casting a Figure  Gard  Prithee  John  what sort of a Creature is a Conjurer  But  Why he's made much as other Men are if it was not for his long grey Beard  Coach  Look ye  Peter  it stands with reason that a Conjurer shou'd have a long grey Beardfor did ye ever know a Witch that was not an Old Woman  Gard  Why I remember a Conjurer once at a Fayr that to my thinking was a very Smockfac'd Man and yet he spew'd out fifty Yards of green Ferret I fancy  John  if thou'dst get him into the Pantry and give him a Cup of Ale he'd shew us a few Tricks Do'st think we cou'd not persuade him to swallow one of thy CaseKnives for his Diversion He'll certainly bring it up again  But  Peter  thou art such a Wiseacre Thou do'st not know the Difference between a Conjurer and a Jugler This Man must be a very great Master of his Trade His Beard is at least half a Yard long he's dress'd in a strange dark Cloak as black as a Cole your Conjurer always goes in Mourning  Gard  Is he a Gentleman had he a Sword by his Side  But  No no he's too grave a Man for that a Conjurer is as grave as a Judgebut he had a long white Wand in his Hand  Coach  You may be sure there's a good deal of Vertue in that WandI fancy 'tis made out of Witch Elm  Gard  I warrant you if the Ghost appears he'll whisk ye that Wand before his Eyes and strike you the Drumstick out of his Hand  But  No the Wand look ye is to make a Circle and if he once gets the Ghost in a Circle then he has himlet him get out again if he can A Circle you must know is a Conjurer's Trap  Coach  But what will he do with him when he has him there  But  Why then he'll overpower him with his Learning  Gard  If he can once compass him and get him in LobsPound he'll make nothing of him but speak a few hard Words to him and perhaps bind him over to his good Behaviour for a Thousand Years  Coach  Ay ay hell send him packing to his Grave again with a Flea in his Ear I warrant him  But  No no I wou'd advise Madam to spare no Cost If the Conjurer be but well paid he'll take pains upon the Ghost and lay him look ye in the RedSeaand then he's laid for ever  Coach  Ay marry that wou'd spoil his Drum for him  Gard  Why  John  there must be a power of Spirits in that same RedSeaI warrant ye they are as plenty as Fish  Coach  Well I wish after all that he may not be too hard for the Conjurer I'm afraid he'll find a tough bit of work on't  Gard  I wish the Spirit may not carry a Corner of the House off with him  But  As for that  Peter  you may be sure that the Steward has made his Bargain with the CunningMan beforehand that he shall stand to all Costs and DamagesBut hark yonder's Mrs  Abigal  we shall have her with us immediately if we do not get off  Gard  Ay Lads if we could get Mrs  Abigal  well laid toowe should lead merry Lives  For to a Man like me that's Stout and Bold  A Ghost is not so dreadful as a Scold

Tinsel  When a Lady's in the Case I'm more afraid of one Fop than twenty Conjurers  Ab  To tell you truly he presses his Attacks with so much Impudence that he has made more Progress with my Lady in two Days than you did in two Months  Fan  I shall attack her in another manner if thou canst but procure me another Interview There's nothing makes a Lover so keen as being kept up in the Dark  Ab

queer old Dog as ever I saw in my Life We must turn him off Widow He cheats thee confoundedly I see that  Lady  Indeed you're mistaken he has always had the Reputation of being a very honest Man  Tin  What I suppose he goes to Church  Lady  Goes to Church so do you too I hope  Tin  I wou'd for once Widow to make sure of you  Lady  Ah Mr  Tinsel  a Husband who would not continue to go thither wou'd

I take Notice thou hast a great deal of old Plate here in the House Widow  Lady  Mr  Tinsel  you are a very observing Man  Tin  Thy large Silver Cistern would make a very good Coach and half a Dozen Salvers that I saw on the Sideboard might be turn'd into six as pretty Horses as any that appear in the Ring  Lady  You have a very good Fancy Mr  Tinsel  What pretty Transformations you could make in my HouseBut I'll see where 'twill end  Aside  Tin  Then I observe Child you have two or three Services of gilt Plate we'd eat always in China my Dear  Lady  I perceive you are an excellent ManagerHow quickly you have taken an Inventory of my Goods  Tin  Now hark ye Widow to show you the Love that I have for you  Lady  Very well let me hear  Tin  You have an oldfashion'd Gold CaudleCup with the Figure of a Saint upon the Lid on't  Lady  I have what then  Tin  Why look ye I'd sell the CaudleCup with the old Saint for as much Money as they'd fetch which I wou'd convert into a Diamond Buckle and make you a Present of it  Lady  Oh you are generous to an Extravagance But pray Mr  Tinsel  don't dispose of my Goods before you are sure of my Person I find you have taken a great Affection to my Moveables  Tin  My Dear I love every thing that belongs to you  Lady  I see you do Sir you need not make any Protestations upon that Subject  Tin  Pho pho my Dear we are growing Serious and let me tell you that's the very next Step to being Dull Come that pretty Face was never made to look grave with  Lady  Believe me Sir whatever you may think Marriage is a serious Subject  Tin  For that very Reason my Dear let us get over it as fast as we can  Lady  I should be very much in haste for a Husband if I married within fourteen Months after Sir  George  's Decease  Tin  Pray my Dear let me ask you a Question Do'st not thou think that Sir  George  is as dead at present to all Intents and Purposes as he will be a Twelvemonth hence  Lady  Yes but Decency Mr  Tinsel    Tin  Or do'st thou think thou'lt be more a Widow then than thou art now  Lady  The World would say I never lov'd my First Husband  Tin  Ah my Dear they wou'd say you lov'd your Second and they wou'd own I deserv'd it for I shall love thee most inordinately  Lady  But what wou'd People think  Tin  Think why they wou'd think thee the Mirrour of WidowhoodThat a Woman shou'd live fourteen whole Months after the Decease of her Spouse without having engaged herself Why about Town we know many a Woman of Quality's Second Husband several Years before the Death of the First  Lady  Ay I know you Wits have your commonplace Jests upon us poor Widows  Tin  I'll tell you a Story Widow I know a certain Lady who considering the Craziness of her Husband had in case of Mortality engaged her self to two young Fellows of my Acquaintance They grew such desperate Rivals for her while her Husband was alive that one of them pink'd the t'other in a Duel But the good Lady was no sooner a Widow but what did my Dowager do Why faith being a Woman of Honour she married a Third to whom it seems she had given her first Promise  Lady  And this is a true Story upon your own Knowledge  Tin  Every Tittle as I hope to be marry'd or never believe  Tom Tinsel    Lady  Pray Mr  Tinsel  do you call this talking like a Wit or like a Rake  Tin  Innocent enough he he he Why where's the Difference my Dear  Lady  Yes Mr  Tinsel  the only Man I ever lov'd in my Life had a great deal of the one and nothing of the other in him  Tin  Nay now you grow vapourish thou'lt begin to fancy thou hear'st the Drum by and by  Lady  If you had been here last Night about this time you would not have been so merry  Tin  About this time say'st thou Come faith for the Humour's sake we'll sit down and listen  Lady  I will if you'll promise to be serious  Tin  Serious never fear me Child Ha ha ha Do'st not hear him  Lady  You break your World already Pray Mr  Tinsel  do you laugh to show your Wit or your Teeth  Tin  Why both my DearI'm glad however that she has taken notice of my Teeth  Aside  But you look serious Child I fancy thou hear'st the Drum do'st not  Lady  Don't talk so rashly  Tin  Why my Dear you cou'd not look more frighted if you had  Lucifer  's DrumMajor in your House  Lady  Mr  Tinsel  I must desire to see you no more in it if you do not leave this idle way of Talking  Tin  Child I thought I had told you what is my Opinion of Spirits as we were drinking a dish of Tea but just nowThere is no such thing I give thee my Word  Lady  Oh Mr  Tinsel  your Authority must be of great weight to those that know you  Tin  For my part Child I have made my self easy in those Points  Lady  Sure nothing was ever like this Fellow's Vanity but his Ignorance  Aside  Tin  I'll tell thee what now WidowI wou'd engage by the help of a white Sheet and a pennyworth of Link in a dark Night to frighten you a whole Country Village out of their Sences and the Vicar into the bargain  Drum beats  Hark hark what Noise is that Heaven defend us this is more than Fancy  Lady  It beats more terrible than ever  Tin  'Tis very dreadful What a Dog have I been to speak against my Conscience only to show my Parts  Lady  It comes nearer and nearer I wish you have not anger'd it by your foolish Discourse  Tin  Indeed Madam I did not speak from my Heart I hope it will do me no hurt for a little harmless Raillery  Lady  Harmless d'ye call it it beats hard by us as if it wou'd break through the Wall  Tin  What a Devil had I to do with a white Sheet  Scene opens and discovers  Fantome  Tin  Mercy on us it appears  Lady  Oh 'tis he 'tis he himself 'tis Sir  George  'tis my Husband  She faints  Tin  Now wou'd I give Ten Thousand Pound that I were in Town    Fantome  advances to him Drumming  Tin  I beg Ten Thousand Pardons I'll never talk at this rate any more    Fantome  still advances Drumming  Tin  By my Soul Sir  George  I was not in earnest  falls on his knees  have Compassion on my Youth and consider I am but a Coxcomb    Fantome  points to the Door  But see he  waves me offay with all my HeartWhat a Devil had I to do with a white Sheet  He steals off the Stage mending his Pace as the Drum beats  Fan  The Scoundrel is gone and has left his Mistress behind him I'm mistaken if he makes Love in this House any more I have now only the Conjurer to deal with I don't question but I shall make his Reverence scamper as fast as the Lover And then the Day's my own But the Servants are coming I must get into my Cupboard  He goes in  Enter  Abigal  and Servants  Ab  Oh my poor Lady This wicked Drum has frighted Mr  Tinsel  out of his Wits and my Lady into a Swoon Let me bend her a little forward She revives Here carry her into the fresh Air and she'll recover  They carry her off  This is a little barbarous to my Lady but 'tis all for her Good and I know her so well that she wou'd not be angry with me if she knew what I was to get by it And if any of her Friends shou'd blame me for it hereafter  I'll clap my Hand upon my Purse and tell 'em  'Twas for a thousand Pound and Mr Vellum  ACT V SCENE I  Enter Sir  George  in his Conjurer's Habit the  Butler  marching before him with two large Candles and the two
