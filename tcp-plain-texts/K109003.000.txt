 THREE DIALOGUES ON THE AMUSEMENTS OF CLERGYMEN  THREE DIALOGUES ON THE AMUSEMENTS OF CLERGYMEN  Renounce the world  the preacher cries  We do  a multitude replies  But one as innocent regards  A snug and friendly game at cards  Another can whate'er you say  Perceive no mischief in a play  Some love a concert or a race  And others shooting and the chase  Reviled yet loved renounced yet followed  Thus bit by bit the world is swallowed  Each thinks his neighbour makes too free  Yet likes a slice as well as he  COWPER  LONDON PRINTED FOR B AND J WHITE FLEETSTREET  ON THE AMUSEMENTS OF CLERGYMEN  WHEN Dr Josiah Frampton's library was sold in London in the year    or    his divinity books were classed in seven lots one of which was pur∣chased by Dr Edwards The catalogue of this lot mentioned a parcel of MSS Among these the Doctor found one in Dr Frampton's own handwriting of which the following is a copy  September  I ALWAYS thought it one of the most fortunate circumstances of my life or rather the most providen∣tial as I ought to call it that soon after my leaving college I was led by various and singular accidents to the curacy of Wroxal in Warwickshire Here I met with many civilities from the gentlemen of the country parti∣cularly from Sir Roger Burgoin who was equally distinguished for his piety and learning At his house I fre∣quently saw that truly venerable man Dr Edward Stillingfleet afterwards Bishop of Worcester but at that time Dean of Paul's He had been  early connected with the Burgoin fa∣mily and ever preserved a great inti∣macy with them which he commonly renewed every year by a visit of two or three weeks  What Dr Stillingfleet saw in me I know not but I thought myself very unworthy of the civilities he shewed me I was certainly at that time a very incorrect young man I had entered into the ministry with little attention to the duties I had taken on me to discharge I loved society and was fond of country di∣versions and though I was fond also of my book I would at any time have  left it for a day's diversion with the houndsa ramble in the woods with my gunor a game of cards and a dance in the evening Such as I was however Dr Stillingfleet was particu∣larly obliging to me and friendly enough to give me a hint now and then with regard to my conduct which I hope I may with truth say was not lost upon meAn opportu∣nity however occurred which ena∣bled me to receive more than  casual  advantage from his conversation  During one of his annual visits to the Burgoin family he was seized with a violent fit of the gout to which  his latter years were very subject It happened at this critical time that Sir Roger Burgoin and his lady were called into Worcestershire to attend their mother who lay at the point of death and as the Dean expressed a desire for my company in their ab∣sence I gave him as much of it as I could following not more his desire than my own inclination He was at that time engaged in correcting his  Origines Sacrae  This very learned work was written when Stillingfleet was under thirty years of age A story is told of his having been put to the blush by Bishop Saunderson his diocesan who seeing a young man at his visitation of the name of Stillingfleet and not knowing his person asked him whether he were related to the great Stillingfleet who wrote the  Origines Sacrae  for a new edition and had  brought down with him several Latin books to consult As I could read that language with accuracy enough I was of some little use to him While I read he noted with his pen the passages he wanted The inter∣vals were filled with conversation  We were sitting together one day after dinner and the Dean lay∣ing up his feet on a cushion and being tolerably free from pain began  to rally me a little on my attachment to country diversionsa subject he had often before casually introduced and on which he knew I had a weak side I had brought him two young partridges that day for his dinner and he began by expressing his obli∣gations to me for my attention to him and then asked me some ques∣tion which led me to give him an account of my day's exploits I did not see his drift and in the spirit of a sportsman told him that the late rainy season had made game very scarcethat the two covies from which I had shot the brace I had brought to him were the only birds  I had seen the whole day though I had been out from five in the morn∣ing till twelve at noon and had walked upwards of fifteen miles  Well said the Dean with an affected gravity of countenance I only wished to know the extent of my obligation to you and I find your philanthropy has done more for me in giving me seven hours of your time to procure me a dinner than I could have done even were I as able to walk as you are for any man in Christen∣dom  From being a little jocular he  became by degrees serious I have often thought said he Mr Frampton and I know your candor will excuse me that the clergy have rather in∣jured the respectability of their cha∣racters by mixing too much with the amusements of laymen They not only get into a trifling way of spend∣ing their time but by making them∣selves cheap they diminish the weight of their instructions and often give a sort of sanction by their presence to gaieties which were better checked It is a common speech in the mouths of licentious people that they must be right because they have gotten the par∣son along with themIndeed a cler∣gyman cannot be too cautious with re∣gard  to his character It is a matter of the greatest delicacy and easily sullied If he act contrary to it he always has a consciousness about him which makes him jealous of every eye and when he becomes hardened he is among the most contemptible of mankindYou will easily however understand that when I restrict the clergyman from joining too freely with the amusements of the laity I am equally hurt with every appear∣ance of haughtiness and moroseness If the character of the clergyman is not marked with modesty and humility it is bereft of its most distinguished graces  But said I Sir may not exam∣ple work the other way and the pre∣sence of a grave clergyman be a check upon licentiousness  Sometimes said he it may and when a clergyman mixes in improper company  with this view  and is con∣scious of his own powers of control he imitates that bright example which sorted with  publicans and sin∣ners  A very respectable clergyman a friend of mine having heard that a favourite youth had been decoyed by bad company into a disreputable house went thither himself and pre∣tending business with the young man  sat down on a slight invitation among a set of debauchees trusting his cha∣racter to its credit He was a man of severe aspect strong sense and ready expression and therefore well fitted for the office he undertook For awhile he overawed by the sud∣denness of his appearance the vice and folly he was mixed with But well knowing that in a little time the impression he made would go off and he might be liable to affronts he re∣tired before the company could rally their impudence and carried off with him his young friend who would frequently declare afterwards that he believed this very circumstance  brought him more to recollection than any event of his life and per∣haps saved him from ruinBut now my dear Sir though I have accommo∣dated your argument with an exam∣ple I must add that I think the ac∣commodation gives it little support I fear the  motive exemplified here  has little weight in the common inter∣course between the clergy and laity  But may not this intercourse said I Sir though without any  direct view  of leading out of  immediate mischief  still have its use Even the presence of a respectable clergyman I should think might often be a happy restraint  Why yes answered the Dean but then my good friend you will consi∣der that a  young  clergyman can rarely act this part Years are necessary to give respectability to  this mode  of in∣structive intercourse Natural talents too which few people possess are ne∣cessary A man of morose character may perhaps be of service with his pen in his closet but however pious and wellmeaning he will hardly be of much use in any of the scenes of common life If again we avoid moroseness by assuming the colour of our company which must in a degree always be done when we wish to re∣form in this way I fear instead of doing good we shall do harm  But it is a difficult matter said I Sir especially for a young man to preserve those exact bounds of inter∣course which his character may re∣quire When he enters first into the world and is taken notice of by those who are in a station above him it is hardly possible for him to resist the importunities he meets with to enter into various amusements to drink his glass freely or make one in par∣ties which in fact perhaps he may not approve  No doubt said the Dean it may be difficult But do you believe that when God placed you in a state of  trial he meant that you should live without difficulties The whole of life is a conflict and if we do not begin early to brace on our moral armour and accustom ourselves to it when are we to enter the fieldI should hope it is for want of conside∣ration more than any thing else that so many young clergymen err in this matter I could wish them to fix in their own minds certain bounds to their amusements and remember the poet's caution  Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum  Aye Sir said I these  certi fines    this narrow path between the  citra  and the  ultra  I have often in vain en∣deavoured to pursue And if you can give me any instruction to guide my footsteps better through the amuse∣ments of life than they have hitherto been conducted I shall kindly receive them and lay them up in a grateful memory  It is very probable my dear Sir said the Dean that my rules may be stricter than you would wish to comply with I have thought often on the su  ject lately for the sake of a young clergyman in whose welldoing I was  much interested but I had not all the success I hoped for  I assured the Dean I should endea∣vour to be a more observant disciple I did indeed spend a considerable part of my time in amusements of various kinds but I was hopeful that my errors proceeded more from inatten∣tion the apology he was pleased to furnish than from any bad disposi∣tion  The good Dean was pleased to say he believed me and added some other friendly expressions which not  being to our present purpose I omit He then asked me what was my idea of an amusement or how I should define it  This was a puzzling question to one who had trespassed so much on this head and who having never thought much on the subject seldom had any end but barely to please him∣self I  could  have given him a defini∣tion of amusement but I was afraid of bringing my own practice too much within its censure To gain therefore a little time for reflection I asked Whether he meant  amusement  in general  or confined the question to the  amusements of clergymen  Why truly said the Dean the amusements of all people require re∣gulation enough But my question at present relates only to the  amuse∣ments of the clergy  I answered that I thought  bodily exercise  was one end and as to the  amusement  of the mind I thought its only end was to relax and fit it the better for study  Your definition said the Dean is  so far good but it does not go far enough It considers only the  pur∣pose  of amusement whereas it should also take in the  quality  You will allow I suppose that the clerical amusement should be suited to the clerical profession  I allowed it certainly  Well then said the Dean we have now I think obtained a full definition of  clerical amusement  It should intend the  exercise of the body and the recrea∣tion of the mind  but it should also be  suited to the genius of the profession  As the first member however of this de∣finition  relates to amusement in gene∣ral and applies as well  ad populum  as  ad clerum  we will if you please pass it over at present If we can esta∣blish the second part I hope there will be no great danger of mistaking the first I shall only therefore en∣deavour to shew you that all  clerical amusements  should be suited to the  clerical profession  Now in order to throw the best light on this subject I should wish to consider amusements under the three heads of  riotous and cruel  of  trifling and seducing  and lastly of  innocent and instructive  for I think it very possible that an amuse∣ment may be characterized with both  these epithets though either may be sufficient Are these heads added he comprehensive enough to include all kinds of amusement Or do you recollect any other  I thought them sufficiently com∣prehensive  Well then said the Dean we will begin with such amusements as are  riotous  and  cruel  and among these I should be inclined to assign the first rank to  hunting  It is an unseeling exercise derived from our savage an∣cestors who hunted at first for  food  and consigned the barbarous practice  to their posterity for  pastime  Its giving birth to forest laws and game lawsits injuring cornlands and destroying fencesits setting squires and their tenants gentlemen and their neighbours at varianceits con∣suming the forage of a country in breeding destructive or useless animals in the room of such as are really use∣fulthe riotous uproar of the chase so opposite to the mild serenity which should characterize the clergyman and the noisy intemperate evening to which it often leads add such an accumulation of mischief to hunting that I should be sorry any clergyman should give his countenance to itTo  this we may add the cruelty exercised both on the animals that pursue and the animals that are pursuedthe horse pushed to the last extremity the hound trained to the chase with savage barbarity  At his foot  The spaniel dying for some venial fault  Under dissection of the knotted scourge  COWPER  and the wretched fugitive agonizing in the extremity of distress  But there is still a greater mischief which often attends these riotous amusements When the squire hunts  with his neighbours he introduces no more corruption into the parish than he found But I have sometimes known annual hunts established in sporting countries which draw toge∣ther hundreds of profligate people from different parts who call them∣selves  gentlemen  but are really  pests  of the neighbourhood to which they re∣sort introducing new vices into the villages and every kind of debauch∣ery Their servants who are com∣monly of the same stamp spread the corruption among the peasants and servantgirls which their masters spread among the farmers' sons and daughtersThe clergyman who  mixes in such scenes is far out of sight of the bare decency of his pro∣fession  But pray Sir said I may not some little plea be offered in favour of hunting Is it not a manly exercise Does it not furnish our tables with food and rid the country of noxious animals  I beseech you said the Dean do not call in argument to defend a pas∣time which has no alliance with rea∣son Call it a wild passiona brutal propensityor anything that indicates its nature But to give it any con∣nection  with reason is making a union between black and whiteBut it is  manly  forsooth to hunt  Manli∣less  I should suppose implies some mode of action that  becomes a man  Hunting might formerly for aught I know have been a manly exercise when the country was overrun with boars and wolves and it was a  public service  to extirpate them But to ho∣nour with the name of  manliness  the cruel practice of pursuing timid animals to put them to death merely for  amusement  is in my opinion perverting the mean∣ing of words There are many ways surely of using manly exercise at least as healthfuland far more innocent  and less expensive and dangerous than galloping over hedges gates and ditches If the  manliness  of the action lie in the risk you run of break∣ing your neck for no end it would still be greater manliness to jump down a precipiceThe foxhunter I doubt not would ridicule the man who runs about with a handnet hunting a butterfly but I protest I see not for what reason The exercise of the butterflyhunter is as good and the pleasure of the chase is to him at least equalBut you alledge that hunting supplies the table with food I dare say Sir Roger's gamekeeper will tell you he could supply it better  in many other ways I have certainly no objection to take the lives of ani∣mals for food and grant that if they were suffered to multiply they would become noxious What I mean is that I cannot allow turning the  destruction  of them into an  amusement  and least of all into a  clerical amusement  I knew a gentleman who took great delight in knocking down an ox which he per∣formed with much dexterity and it was his common amusement to go among the butchers on a slaughteringday and give two or three of them a shilling apiece to let him be their substitute in that operation You call such a man a brute and he surely  was one But you would find it diffi∣cult to shew that the circumstance of riding on a horse and bawling after a pack of dogs makes the amuse∣ment less brutal  Surely said I Sir there is a differ∣ence between the pleasure of a pur∣suit and a pleasure which consists merely in the act of inflicting death  Why yes answered the Dean there is a difference but I know not on which side of it the advantage lies If hunting be a more  genteel  species of butchery it is certainly a more  cruel  one The ox receives its death  by an instant stroke whereas the hare is first thrown into convulsions of terror for four or five hours toge∣ther and then seized in the midst of its agony and torn piecemeal by a pack of ravenous bloodhounds  Detested sport  That owes its pleasure to another's pain  That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks  Of harmless nature  COWPER  As to your last argument that hunt∣ing rids the country of noxious ani∣mals I apprehend you are mistaken in the fact I rather think it tends to replenish the country with them As one instance at least I can testify that I  offended a whole club of sporting neighbours in a manner that was hardly ever to be gotten over by giving a man halfacrown for killing a fox which had thinned my poultryyard And I dare say there is not a hunting squire in the country who would not at any time give up a do∣zen of his tenant's lambs to save half the number of foxes' cubs Nay I have often known covers of considerable extent left purposely in fields or per∣haps planted merely to decoy foxes into a neighbourhood by providing a proper shelter for themBut you have provoked me to say all this by aiming to establish an alliance between  hunting and rationality I intended not to disturb the squire either in his riotous day or his roaring night I consider  his  malady as a surgeon does a mortification which has seized the vitalsbeyond all hope of recovery What I mean is only to admonish the clergyman not to follow his ex∣ample  It is but just however to say that examples to warn him might also be found in our own profession I re∣member a clergyman in a neighbour∣hood where I once lived who had two benefices but he spent little time at either of them because neither  happened to be in a sporting country The huntingseason he always spent near a squire in the parish next to mine whose disciplined pack was famous With this gentleman and his hounds he lived on terms of the greatest inti∣macy Indeed both the squire and his dogs looked up to him as their ablest leader Though he was a mi∣serable preacher he was uncommonly musical in the field and could cheer and animate his sonorous friends with an eloquence beyond the huntsman himself whose associate he always was and whose place on any emergency he could amply supply He was much readier at finding a hare than  a text of scripture and though he was scarce acquainted with the face of one of his parishioners he knew ex∣actly the character of every hound in the squire's pack and could run over their names with much more readi∣ness than those of the twelve apo∣stles  Oh laugh or mourn with me the rueful jest  A cassock'd huntsman  He takes the field the master of the pack  Cries Well done Saintand claps him on the back  Is this the path of sanctity Is this  To stand a waymark in the road to bliss  COWPER  He had at length the misfor∣tune to break his neck at the end of a  foxchase but not till he had first broken the heart of a very amiable woman who had unhappily connect∣ed herself with him  Such a clergyman said I is hardly to be paralleled in a century But in an inferior degree I fear there are many of our brethren who allow themselves great indulgence I re∣member a huntingclergyman who received a very proper rebuke from one of his brethren and which I have reason to believe was of service to him as long as he lived He had been lamenting his unfortunate lot in being stationed in a country where  there was no hunting The other looking him full in the face said with great gravity of countenance and in a deliberate tone of voice "At the great day of accounts the question will not be  where  have you lived but  how  have you lived"All this however is carrying amusement to ex∣cess But suppose Sir when you are riding out you happen to hear the hounds is there any harm merely in taking a little exercise with them if you do not join in the riot of the chase  I hate said the Dean to see a man do any thing by halves Is it right  or is it wrong If it be right do it boldly If it be wrong turn your horse another way and take your ex∣ercise in a contrary direction Never go to the edge of a precipice You can hardly help going a little farther than you intended I remember hearing a story of a clergyman who was not remarkable for neglecting at least the outward part of his duty but once unhappily forgot it through his love for hunting He was eager∣ly engaged in a foxchase when the fox  took to earth  as they call it on which he cried out  Gentlemen I must leave you This puts me in mind that I have a corpse to bury  at four o'clock this evening and I fear I shall be an hour too late  Besides continued the Dean you cannot well avoid in this field of riot at least if you are often seen in it making an acquaintance with several to whom for your character's sake you would not wish to be known But indeed as I observed to mix in any degree in these scenes of cruelty and riotous exultation is un∣becoming the clerical profession Farther still to close my argument with scripture I should wish you to consider that as many good people as well as I disapprove a clergyman's mixing in these riotous amusements  so of course it will give offence to all these good people No man there∣fore who has the honour of his pro∣fession at heart would give offence where the matter in question is of so little consequence as a mere amuse∣ment Let him consider how strict St Paul was in matters of this kind St Paul's example is certainly not very fashionable but with a clergy∣man I should hope it might have some weight He gives us many hints which come home to the point we are now discussing Hunting was out of the question He would not certainly have permitted Timothy or Titus to hunt if they had been so  disposed But he forbids us to give offence in matters that are of much more concern than mere amusement  If meat  says he  make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest I make my brother to offend  I told the good Dean he had si∣lenced me I was afraid my love for the diversion had been founded rather on inclination than argument But no∣body again I hoped should ever  take offence  at my following a pack of houndsBut pray said I Sir do you allow shooting It is a much less riotous amusement nay it may even be a solitary one  To speak plainly replied the Dean I cordially allow no  amusement  to a clergyman that has any thing to do with  shedding blood  Besides I think a peculiar cruelty attends this diver∣sion You may wound and maim as well as kill My  heart  I am sure would be strongly affectedindeed even my  conscience  if I should make a poor animal miserable all the days of its life for the sake of giving my∣self a momentary amusementIt was but the last autumn when riding down a lane I saw two poor miserable partridgesboth bleeding and one trailing a shattered leg after itflut∣tering and running before me Poor  wretches said I I wish the person who put you into this miserable situa∣tion may never feel the distress he has occasioned I then ordered my servant to dismount and run after them The lame one he caught the other crawled into a hedge where it probably lingered out its miserable life a few days longer  But the expert marksman I told the Dean never shoots among a co∣vey but takes his aim at a single bird  And are all shooters said he  ex∣pert marksmen  And does the expert  marksman himself never maim the bird he aims at or the bird that is near it Often I have no doubt he maims bothTo repel the attack of a bird or beast of prey I have cer∣tainly no objection nor to take the life of an animal for food though I should not wish to make a clergyman the butcher whether an ox or a par∣tridge is to be slaughtered But to take the life of an animal except in one or the other of these cases I hold to be absolutely immoral And I think it is no better to run the risk of maiming it and making it miserable for life The most humane way therefore is to take birds with a net  which allows you to discharge such as you wish and put to a speedy death those you take for food  But to take birds in a net said I Sir is not at all in the spirit of sports∣menBesides there are some species of game as pheasants particularly which cannot be taken in nets  Do not tell me replied the Dean of the  spirit of sportsmen  Though the ties of humanity no doubt equally bind them yet to such hopeless hearers I should no more attempt to preach than I should to their spa∣nielsNor do I pretend to know  what kind of game may be taken in one way and what in another though I have no doubt but my friend Robert  Sir Roger's game keeper  could inform me how pheasants might be taken without shooting them But what I labour at chiefly is to convince such soberminded clergymen as I conceive you to be that every species of bloody and cruel amusement is unsuitable to the genius and temper of a Christian divine and enters more by habit into a character than is commonly supposed It is under the idea of tainting a character with professional  habits that the butcher is prohibited from serving on a jury  For myself Sir I replied I am only ashamed that from the dictates of my own reason I have not sooner acknowledged the truths you set be∣fore me I always had my doubts but not supposing amusements of this kind to be  sinful  and not conceiving them to be  improper  from the eager∣ness with which numbers of my elder brethren pursue them I stifled my own suggestions But in my present sentiments I believe I shall never fire a gun again for my diversion at any kind of game  To assist your good resolutions said the Dean I can suggest two or three other considerations which are worth the attention of a clergyman He can scarce be settled in any place in which he will not find the squire of his parish attached violently to his game and jealous of every man who interferes with him in this great point He is especially jealous of the clergyman whom he considers as an interloper I have known many clergymen get into silly squabbles on this score and by making themselves obnoxious to the squire render them∣selves much less able to be of service in their parishes On many occa∣sions  the squire's countenance may be of great use to the clergyman in ma∣naging his parochial affairs and it is highly imprudent to lose his assist∣ance for a trifle  I once said I experienced this in∣convenience myself But I had the discretion when I found I had raised a jealousy immediately to desist At present I have free permission from Sir Roger and two or three other gentlemen of the country to range their domains when I please So that I lay down my arms in the pleni∣tude of my power  I should wish still farther to suggest  to you continued the Dean that if any mischance in these violent exer∣cises should happen to a clergyman it tells much worse than when it happens to another person How oddly would it sound if the parish were told on a Sunday there could be no service because the parson had put out his shoulder the day before by a fall at a foxchase If a clergy∣man lose a hand or an eye in shooting as is sometimes the case I have ge∣nerally found the commiseration of people mixed with a certain degree of contempt If he had been about his business they would say it would not have happenedThe commission also  of an accidental mischief in these un∣clerical amusements will always be more distressing at least it ought to a clergyman than to a laymanPoor Archbishop Abbot was a melancholy instance He was exemplary in many points but unhappily indulged himself in the amusement of shooting and as he was taking this exercise in a park belonging to Lord Zouch in Hamp∣shire he had the misfortune to shoot one of the keepers After this event he never recovered his cheerfulness and party running high it gave his enemies a great handle against him It was brought as a question whether he could ever again officiate as an  archbishop After a long inquiry it was determined that he must be de∣graded but that the king might again restore him which was accordingly doneI could point out a prelate of these days  About the beginning of James II  who does his character no service by being a sportsman For∣merly he kept a pack of hounds but has had the decency since he ob∣tained a mitre to dismiss them He is still however his own gamekeeper and is so expert that he wants no assistance in furnishing his table with every article of game Archbishop Abbot's misfortune reminds me of a  similar accident of which this prelate had nearly been the occasion A young lady who lived near him was riding quietly along a close lane when a gun went off on the other side of the hedge close to her horse's ear The beast took frightstarted vio∣lently asideand threw her though providentially she was not hurt While her servant was following her horse she walked gently up the lane and coming to an opening in the hedge the bishop in all his shooting accoutrements presented himself He made his apology and hoped she was not hurt She thanked him for his kind enquiry but said she should  have been better pleased if it had been needless  I told the Dean I remembered something of the story about two years ago in the public prints  Yes said the Dean she was an arch girl and inserted it in a very ludi∣crous manner making a laughable contrast between the bishop's sporting attire and his lawn sleeves and other episcopal habiliments  Dr Johnson's profound reverence for the hierarchy made him expect from bishops the highest degree of decorum There are gradations he said in conduct there is mo∣ralitydecencypropriety None of these should be violated by a bishop When a bishop places himself in a situation where he has no distinct character and is of no consequence he degrades the dignity of his order Nor was it only in the dignitaries of the church that Dr Johnson required a particular decorum and delicacy of behaviour he justly considered that the clergy as persons set apart for the sacred office of serving at the altar and impress∣ing the minds of men with the awful concerns of a future state should be somewhat more se∣rious than the generality of mankind and have a suitable composure of manners A due sense of the dignity of their profession inde∣pendent of higher motives will ever prevent them from losing their distinction in an indis∣criminate sociality and did such as affect this know how much it lessens them in the eyes of those whom they think to please by it they would feel themselves much mortified  Boswells Life of Johnson  vol iii p    Well Sir said I I hope these ex∣amples will prove sufficient cautions to me though I am sorry to receive them from such exalted characters I should wish you however to believe that I am an enemy to cruelty in all  shapes and do not remember that I ever wantonly took the life of the meanest reptile  We certainly said the Dean have no right When a spider takes possession  of my house or a snail of my garden I make no scruple to destroy them They are invaders But if I meet with either of them in the fields I should think myself the invader if I disturbed them If a wolf attempt to seize a lamb which is my property and under my protection I think his life should pay the forfeit But if he can seize an antelope or any other wild animal with which I have no concern I have no authority to inter∣fere He has the same deed of gift to alledge for seizing his prey which I have for the beef or mutton I buy in the market And yet I know not whether I should not put him to  death wherever I found him as a proscribed villain as always acting under at least a tacit declaration of war against me If I were not well assured he would attack me when he could I am persuaded I should never molest himMan regulates his ac∣tions towards his  fellowmen  by  laws and customs  But certainly there are laws also to be observed between man and beast which are equally coercive though the injured party has no power of appeal  I fully accede said I Sir to your code of criminal law between man and beast It is certainly power not  right that we appeal to in wantonly disposing of the lives of animals And what surprises me the more is we often see this wanton breach of natural law in men of humanity An acquaintance of mine who is as rea∣dy as any man to do a goodnatured action will stand whole mornings by the side of a bridge shooting swal∣lows as they thread the arch and flit past him He is however no clergy∣man  Let him be what he will said the Dean his profession has been mistaken and he ought to have been bred a butcher I can have no conception  of the humanity of a man who can find his amusement in destroying the happiness of a number of little inno∣cent creatures sporting themselves during their short summer in skim∣ming about the air and without doing injury of any kind pursuing only their own little happy excursions and catching the food which Providence has allotted themBut I have seen instances enough of this kind of cru∣elty to remove all surprise More offence from such despotism I never remember to have taken than about five or six years ago in a little voyage I made into the Irish sea A nephew of mine the captain of a cruizer  whom you saw here last summer was then lying at Milfordhaven and being about to take the voyage I have mentioned was desirous to carry me with him as I had expressed an incli∣nation to see the wonderful rocky barrier which nature had formed against the ocean along many of the coasts of Wales As we drew near a promontory where the rocks were lofty we found them inhabited by thousands of seafowl of different kinds which at that season frequent them I was greatly amused with seeing the variety of their busy ac∣tions and different modes of flight and with hearing the harsh notes of  each when single and their varied tones changed into a sort of wild harmony by the clangor of all toge∣ther One should have thought a co∣lony like this might have been safe from all annoy They are useless when deadand harmless when alive We saw however as we proceeded two or three boats anchoring at differ∣ent distances in which were certain  savages  I can call them by no other namediverting themselves with shooting at these poor birds as they flew from their nests or returned to them with food from the sea de∣stroying not only the parentbirds but leaving the helpless progeny to  clamour in vain for food and die of hunger This mode of taking life for no end is a species of cruelty which I should wish to brand with the severest name and should almost detest a clergyman who should find his amusement in it  I must allow said I Sir that what you have said against hunting and shooting hath entirely convinced me of the impropriety of both as clerical amusementsYou have said nothing however against fishing Do you al∣low me to suppose this amusement to be a clerical one It is silent quiet and may be contemplative  I am afraid replied the Dean I shall be thought too rigid if I abridge a clergyman of this amusement Only I absolutely enjoin him not to impale worms on his hook but to fish either with an artificial fly or a dead bait If he like fishing with a net I approve it more but still I cannot bring myself to  recommend  any  amusement  to him which arises from  destroying life  But said I Sir fishing seems to have scriptural authority Many of the apostles were fishermen and our Saviour himself bids Peter  cast his hook into the sea  Why yes answered the Dean but I doubt whether we get much from these authorities Fishing you know was the occupation of several of the apostles they fished with nets for a livelihood and St Peter you will remember did not  cast his hook into the sea  for his  amusement  However you find I am not very rigid on this headIndeed all I have said about taking the lives of animals amounts only to thisthat we have no right to do it except for food or to get rid of a nuisanceand that when we are obliged to take life we should always take it in the easiest manner All this appears to me so much the dic∣tate  of nature and truth that no man can controvert it  in reason  whatever he may do  in practice  But the cler∣gyman is under the still stricter ties of decency and respect to his character  But have not you Sir said I con∣fined within too strict a limit the power of man over the lives of ani∣mals Are there not other reasons besides obtaining food and the re∣moval of a nuisance which may make the exercise of that power lawful May we not take the whale for his oil and the beaver for his fur  I allow it said the Dean Where  the uses of man preponderate his right over the animal seems just But perhaps greater liberty may be com∣monly taken in this matter than my code will allow If the use be trivial I reject the claim I permit you to take the whale for his oil but I should not readily grant you leave to destroy the elephant for his tooth  I told the Dean I saw the difference very plainly But said I Sir do you allow the philosopher to take life in making his researches into nature in examining the wonders of the micro∣scope in tracing the circulation of the blood in discovering the proper∣ties  of air and in other things which tend to advance human knowledge and often serve some great end of utility  This question said the Dean is rather more difficult What pro∣motes human knowledge or serves any essential purpose of utility is cer∣tainly of more consequence than the life of an animal and I give you li∣berty to take it when you are sure your motive is good But I should interdict this privilege to mere  curio∣sity  We may believe on the credit of others that the blood circulates  or that an animal will die in an ex∣hausted receiver  I then asked the Dean if he did not think on the other hand that we might carry our tenderness in taking life too far I have frequently said I deserted a path I wished to walk in because I have found it preoccupied by a train of ants which it hurt me to crush And yet I have sometimes thought my caution unnecessary  No doubt replied the Dean every virtue has its extremesits  ultra  as we just observed as well as its  citra  I have often seen this tenderness in taking life carried to a ridiculous length if we can call any thing ridi∣culous that is founded on an amiable principle I knew a humane man who would not suffer a mouse to be taken in a snaptrap He allowed it to be taken alive but he took care to have it carried to a distance into the fields and there set at liberty He would not destroy a spider though he made no scruple to sweep away its web My dear Sir I once said to him  your tender mercies are cruel  It would certainly be more merciful to dispatch these poor animals at once than to make them misera∣ble  by turning them adrift or leav∣ing them to a languishing death by taking from them their means of subsistence All this therefore seems to me absurd It is making the lives of animals of more con∣sequence than they should be It is making a man miserable for the sake of a mite For if we carry this ten∣derness as far as it will fairly go we ought neither to eat a plum nor taste a drop of vinegar It is not size which gives value to life The insect that forms the blue of a plum or that frisks in a drop of vinegar has certainly the same claim to exist as a spider or a mouse And how far life  extends we know not so that our tenderness in this respect if indulged to excess might be endless Like Indian Bramins we should not dare to lie down or set a foot to the ground without examining every footstep with microscopical exactness But as these little swarms of nature interfere thus with all the concerns of men it is plain that Providence does not lay much stress on their lives All there∣fore that seems required in these cases is to abstain from wanton in∣juryI would not however have you always take the measure of a man's virtue by the extraordinary tenderness of his feelings I knew a gentleman  so extremely tender towards the lives of animals that when an earwig crept out of a log of wood which had been laid on his fire he forbade any more logs to be taken from that pile and left it to rot Yet this very man with all these nice feelings about him lived avowedly in a state of adultery Such tenderness therefore may or may not be allied to virtuecertainly not necessarily so allied It is founded merely in nature But when  any one  affection of the mind is regulated by a  religious principle  there is in that mind a  controlling power  which regulates  other  affections Thus if we abstain from cruelty on a  religious principle  we may depend on that  principle  on other occasions As to these  delicate feelings  they seldom reach beyond their  immediate object  Here the Dean made a pause and after a little recollection said he thought we had now run over all the  riotous  and  cruel  amusements which he could recollect As for  cockfighting  and  horseracing  he added they are such gambling di∣versions that I conceive no clergy∣man would even be present at the former nor enter into the spirit of the latter The raceground is a wide field and if he ever enter it for curiosity he will not only avoid the deep concerns and commerce of the  place if I may so phrase it but will also keep entirely aloof from the noise and bustle and clamour of the scene A friend of mine lived on the confines of a celebrated raceground He was fond of horses merely as beautiful objects which he liked to see in their various motions and as people are generally well mounted at a race and much agitated he used to gratify his curiosity by walking out in an evening about the time the race was over and would get behind some hedge where unseen he had a good view of the company returning from their sport over a fair plain This was to him the only  amusement of a race and he would say he believed he had more pleasure from the sober enjoyment of this moving picture than any one could feel who entered into the wild joy and jollity of the scene  Here our conversation ended at that time The good Dean com∣plaining that his feet grew a little troublesome rang for his servant to change his posture and I thinking myself in the way wished him a good night  END OF THE FIRST DIALOGUE  I thought they deserved to be as∣saulted  I know not said I Sir whether I thought quite so ill of them I have always been accustomed to think that moderately used they were an inno∣cent amusement even for a clergy∣man  But pray said the Dean in exa∣mining the propriety or impropriety the innocence or guilt of an action are you to consider how it affects yourself alone or how it affects the public in general  No doubt I replied a publicspirited man will consider his actions in refer∣ence to the public  He certainly ought said the Dean and this being allowed do not you consider the present rage for cardplaying through all ranks of people as a public evil  I replied it was no doubt an amuse∣ment much abused but the abuse I thought lay only at the door of the abuser Meat and drink were abuseddress was abusedthe Bible itself was abused but we must have these things notwithstanding  Aye there returned the Dean you point out the true distinction You answer yourself We  must  have the one but  need not  have the other Does it follow because we  must  have meat and drink though they are abused that we must necessarily have cards alsoIf then cards be al∣lowed to be a public evil and we are at the same time under  no necessity  to have them every conscientious man would give up a thing so trifling as an amusement at best is to avert that evil and by refraining he cer∣tainly does avert it as far as his own i  fluence and example reach  You do not mean said I Sir that cards are in themselves essentially bad  Why no said he Cards  in them∣selves  may afford as innocent amuse∣ment as any thing else And yet I know not whether this concession is not too much I have been used myself to consider amusements under the head of such as are strictly social and of such as contain in them a principle adverse to society Many amusements are of the former kind but cards and some other games in which one party must be victorious and the other subdued encourage a  kind of principle somewhat opposite to the social temper and the many little squabbles even among friends at such games prove the truth of my remark However if they could be played at with such moderation as occasioned no heartburning I should be inclined to wave  this objection  and consider chiefly the  excess  It is this indeed which creates the great mischief and the  example  spreads it If cards are played in the parlour they descend to the kitchen and from your parlour and kitchen to those of your neighbour and so on The lust of cardplaying is now become so flagitious that every serious man I  affirm ought to withdraw his own ex∣ample from so general and pernicious a practice The clergyman in par∣ticular should dread to sanction what has certainly so bad an effect on the manners of the people  But said I Sir my example is of so little weight that it cannot make things either better or worse  There is not replied the Dean with some warmth in the whole ma∣gazine of false reasoning a more de∣structive mode of it than this I will not set a good example because I know another will not follow it So  nobody will set a good example We have betterrules surely to direct us than the practice of other people When a man thus puts his own prac∣tice and example into the hands of others and depends upon his neigh∣bour's conduct to regulate his own what reformation can we expect If we are right under such circum∣stances it is by chance Every man's example has its influence more or less which he should endeavour for the sake of good order to make as instructive as he can without trou∣bling himself with the example of others In families where cards are never played at in the parlour I dare  take upon me to say they are rarely played at in the kitchen except per∣haps where servants who have already learned their lesson in cardplaying families are introducedAnd if the obligation to avoid setting a bad ex∣ample in this instance be general it binds the ecclesiastic with double force He should certainly be the  salt of the earth  and endeavour to keep every thing as far as he can from corruption Consider what a change even that might effect There are perhaps twenty or thirty thousand ecclesiastics of different denomina∣tions scattered about the various parts of England If each of these  influence a dozen which including their own families is no extraordi∣nary calculation consider what a party would be gained over Each of these again we may suppose might have some influence and if we may adopt our Saviour's allusion we might hope to see it work like leaven through the whole mass At least we might hope to see cards confined within the gloomy walls of gaminghouses and nightcellars  But I should think said I Sir we should  begin  our reformation at these places If we could get rid of gaminghouses and nightcellars  which the high and low vulgar fre∣quent cards might perhaps be left to us sober people as an innocent amuse∣ment  Not so entirely my good friend answered the Dean It is not only when cards are carried to this per∣nicious height that I except against them Indeed when a man has taken his degrees at a gamingtable I have done with him He is beyond re∣ceiving instruction from me I must therefore inform you that I do not confine the gamingtable to what is called so as they say  I rank under that head all those scenes  of profligacy scattered not only through the metropolis but through every part of the country where high stakes are pledged and welldressed people meet not so much with a view of amusement as with a purpose to pillage one anotherThese however are only the  excesses  of cardplaying but for various other reasons it should be discouraged In the best light I think cards afford only a frivolous and seducing amusement especially to a clergyman They often lead him into more expence still short of what may be called  gaming  than may be prudent for him to incur Once engaged in the habit of playing or  listed if I may so phrase it into the corps of cardplayers he cannot sometimes avoid venturing higher stakes than he could wishBut sup∣pose he keep the scales of loss and gain pretty even as I have sometimes heard the moderate cardplayer boast what shall we say for the expence of time Here comes in a very se∣ducing part Evening after evening is lost The afternoon is often added Habits are formed Play and com∣fort are connected and the day ends in joyless vacancy that does not con∣clude with cardsBesides you give yourself into the hands of others It is unsocial to break up a party You  are not therefore master of yourselfThen again consider you cannot choose your company You are a known cardplayer you cannot stand out when a hand is wanted and must often consort with those you disesteemAbove all young people should consider how easily where amusements are concerned the mind glides into habits of indulgence In these journeys of pleasure step follows step mechanically I knew a young lady thus debauched into a cardplayer though she was once among the most amiable of her sexdomes∣ticingeniousfond of booksfull of resources and never at a loss for  the employment of her time Family amusements were all the pleasures she sought Her father and mother were excellent people and brought her up an only daughter in what I may justly call the cheerful restraints of religion But during a short visit at a relation's to which her father re∣luctantly consented she unhappily got a taste for cardplaying and when she returned home did not much en∣joy those innocent domestic circles in which before she had given and received so much pleasure In short she had lost her heart to this vile amusement Soon afterwards she married a young gentleman of for∣tune  a sober virtuous and modest young man but of talents very infe∣rior to those of his wife With dis∣cretion she might have modelled her family as she had pleased and had an excellent model before her in her father's but she chose rather to cor∣rupt her husband and turn his man∣sion into a gaming houseI mention this example as one among a hundred I have seen in my life to shew the rapid progress of pleasurable habits and those of cards perhaps beyond all others to which I think particularly belongs that excellent adage  Princi∣piis obsta  But since said I Sir we are often obliged to consort with those whom we disesteem or with those whose minds are too unfurnished to bear a part in conversation is it not useful and often necessary to introduce something that removes for the time at least all disgustssomething that may level those who have not sense with those who have and en∣able them to pass their time together in mutual civility without labouring to support a conversation which most probably more than half of them are utterly unable to support  This is the first time said the Dean  smiling I ever heard cards mentioned as a bond of benevolence as the cause of illhumour and dissension I have often heard them taxed But I sup∣pose you do not hold the argument seriously You cannot imagine cards to be more effectual to this end than even those modes of general civility which commonly reign among polite people and check during the inter∣course all appearance of such little hostilities as may rankle within At least you must allow that cardplaying is not quite a clerical mode of incul∣cating benevolenceAnd as to your solicitude to lower the man of wit and sense to a level with his neigh∣bours  and bring conversation to an equilibrium I think it illjudged If the man of sense have any goodna∣ture in his composition he will not be much hurt at bestowing on his weaker neighbour a pittance of his own in∣formation and wisdom At least it is not well done in you to furnish him with an apology to withhold it How is the poor man to improve if on his coming into company an immediate stop is put to all conversation by calling for cardsHowever I consi∣der this argument only as a shuffle Any conversation is surely better than the dull monotony of a cardtable He who can bear the conversation of  a card player may bear any thing For myself I protest I should make better company of a parrot  I cannot said I truly say much for the conversation of a cardtable ex∣cept that it is innocent and may keep conversation from taking a worse turn  Why yes said the Dean and so it would if you should clap a gag into every body's mouth when he went into company At the same time I should lay but little stress either on one expedient or the other A short  restraint  affords no  amendment  Bring  the axe to the root of the treecor∣rect the heartand you do something But till that be done the propensity to scandal may be  checked  but will find its opportunity to  break out  whether you play at cards or not Perhaps like fermenting liquor it may burst out with more violence from having been confined  But perhaps said I Sir it may be worth consideration that if people do not employ their vacant time on cards they may do worse  I know not what they can do worse  answered the Dean if you respect their amusements only And if you think cards will keep a young fellow from the stews or a debauch when he is inclined to either I fear you attri∣bute much more to them than they deserve If a man be fond of two games both are amusements and so far as there is a similitude between them the love of one may perhaps overpower an attachment to the other But when a man is fond of a  game  and addicted to a  vice  as there is no similitude between the objects you have no more ground for expecting the former will drive out the latter  than for supposing a man's dancing a minuet should prevent his admiring a picture  You drive me said I Sir out of all my strong holds but you must give me leave to make one observation more I have heard sickly people speak of cards as a great relief in pain when the mind is incapable of any other attention And if exciting this frivolous attention will draw it from attending to its malady cards I think are an opium and may often be called a blessing  I have certainly no objection re∣plied  the Dean to their being used medicinally But then I should wish to have them sold only at the apothe∣cary's shop and the doctor to pre∣scribe the use of them I should fear if the patient prescribed for himself he may be apt to take too large a dose as he often does of laudanum and other anodyne drugs I once knew an old lady who had lost the use of her speech and of both her hands by two or three paralytic strokes and every evening took the remedy you have been prescribing She was a lady of large fortunegave good suppersand had genera  ly a number of humble friends about her  one of whom always after supper dealt sorted and held her cards and pointing to this or that the old lady nodded at the card she wished to have her friend play But it sometimes happened that the paralytic shake of the head was mistaken for the nod of approbation and unfortunately a wrong card was played which threw the old lady whose whole heart was in the remedy she was taking into such violent fits of passion that people thought she received more injury from these irritations than benefit from the prescription  I fear said I Sir from all this ridi∣cule  that you thought what I ad∣vanced rather impertinent  My ridicule replied the Dean was not surely directed at you but at those poor pitiable objects who can∣not even at the close of life be hap∣py without their cards I have heard of many such and have known some At a time when serious thoughts and meditation are the most becom∣ing it is pitiable in the last degree to see the dregs of life running off in so wretched a manner If there is any thing in human nature which unites contempt and commiseration said a friend of mine coming from a sight  of this kind it is the spectacle of a man going down to the grave with a pack of cards in his hand  Indeed said I Sir these fright∣ful examples are of themselves suffi∣cient warningsBut I have done I give up my cause I was willing to say what I could for an amusement in which I fear I have had too great an interest But I hope Sir I shall not be the worse either for your ridi∣cule or your instructionAfter all however it must be confessed that we young clergymen have a difficult part to act The prevalence of custom is  a vehement tide which we find it very hard to stem  I should therefore said the Dean wish you to keep out of it which every man may if he please Be re∣solute at first in resisting importunity and importunity will presently cease You will soon be considered as one who has a will of his ownThe clergy I think may be divided into two great bodies One class are such as enter into the ministry only to make their fortunes These are a kind of amphibious ani∣mals I cannot call them clergymen They are traders in ecclesiastical  goods With them my arguments have nothing to do They have no scruples and will comply of course with every thing that will recommend them to the worldIn the other class are many no doubt who have the end and honour of their profession at heart and wish only to be con∣vinced of the propriety or impro∣priety of a thing to do it or leave it undone But there are numbers I fear in this class wellmeaning on the whole and serious men who are yet ready to make the customs of the world an apology for a variety of im∣proper practices and slide into a number of corrupt habits without  considering that to oppose the se∣ducing customs of the world is the very essence of a state of trial and that it is the very business of a good pastor to set up his own example as a way mark against them  To all this I fully assented  Aye Mr Frampton continued the Dean with much earnestness in his manner these are serious truths The customs of the world put a gloss upon many improper thingsamong which I reckon cards and mislead numbers who are glad perhaps to misinterpret the apostle and tell you that if they  do them not  they must altogether go out of the world  But whatever liber∣ties the layman takes and yet I know not what gives him any exclusive li∣berty the clergyman ought to be particularly guarded against the in∣dulgence of any amusement which is fraught with so much mischief both public and private which so easily gains ground by the force of habit and in the defence of which you see so little can be said Many bad ha∣bits subside in age Nature cannot hold out But here is a mischievous propensity which cleaves often to our very last sand It is possible I may yet live to see people so barefaced as  to make no distinction of days and play at cards on Sundays It is prac∣tised I am informed in France from which we derive too many of our fashions  I told the Dean that as I believed I was better acquainted with the hi∣story of cardplaying than he was I was afraid that vile practice though not frequent had gotten at least some footing among  us  One instance I knew I had not long ago the ho∣nour to be admitted in a dearth of better company to the cardtable of a lady of fashion Soon after I found she played at cards on Sundays when  fearing lest I should be involved in the imputation of that practice I ne∣ver would touch another card at her house On her calling me to account for deserting my post I plainly told her the reason This led to a short debate She said after the duties of the day were over for she was a con∣stant churchwoman she thought a little recreation in the evening was very allowable I talked of the great impropriety at least of  breaking down fences  and laying the practice open to the common people even though she would not allow any profanation of the day She thought the fault  lay in the cattle that  went through the breach  At length however she al∣lowed that playing at  cards on a Sun∣day  was a very improper practice to get  among the lower people  and far∣ther that when  carried to the height of gaming  it was a very improper Sun∣dayamusement to  any one  I beg∣ged she would suffer me to shew her merely on  these two concessions of her own  the mischief of playing at cards  at all  on a Sunday And that she might see it in the stronger light I offered to put my arguments on pa∣per But I could never obtain leave She always stopped my mouth with  saying she had made up her mind and wished to hear no more on the subject  I honour you said the Dean as I should every young clergyman who could make so proper a stand against a vicious fashionAnd now in re∣turn for your story in which you have given me an instance of some  duplicity  I will contrast it with one of genuine  simplicity  A friend of mine had a cu∣rate recommended from Cambridge an excellent young man who had never been in a scrape during the whole time he had been at the uni∣versity He was addicted to no im∣proper  amusement and cards in particular he disliked It happened however on some singular occasion I believe on that of a young lady's coming of age he was invited among several other young folks to spend an evening where cards made a part of the entertainment He stood out stre∣nuously as wholly ignorant of every game At last some  general game  We have among us at present a kind of game which is called a  round game  from the company's sitting  round  a table The Dean probably alludes to some such game as this which might be in use in his time  I know not what they call it being proposed and some of the company  as corruptors are always at hand instructing him in what he could not but feel he had powers of mind to comprehend he was drawn in and sat down though little attentive to the business in which he was engaged At the end of the game when the accounts of profit and loss were settled his companions gave him four shillings to his great surprise for certain little ivory fish which he had received in the course of the game The next morning when he told the story he said it was a fortunate thing that he had been successful for if he had lost four shillings instead of win∣ning them he should certainly have  gone off without paying his debt as he had not the least conception that the ivory fish he had received repre∣sented any thing but themselves  The good Dean having thus dis∣patched the cardtable led me next to the playhouse What a noble institution said he have we here if it were properly regulated I know of nothing that is better calculated for moral instructionnothing that holds the glass more forcibly to the follies and vices of mankind I would have it go hand in hand with the pulpit It has nothing indeed to do with scrip∣ture and Christian doctrines The  pa∣geants  as I think they were called of the last century used to represent scripturestories which were very im∣properly introduced and much bet∣ter handled in the pulpit But it is impossible for the pulpit to represent vice and folly in so strong a light as the stage One addresses our reason the other our imagination and we know which receives commonly the more forcible impression There should always however be a little dash of the  caricature  to give a zest to  character  But nature and proba∣bility should be strictly observed I rememberI believe it is now thirty years agoseeing a play acted I for∣get  its title in which an old fellow is represented dallying with a coquettish girl It was an admirable picture from nature The sprightly actions of youth imitated by the ridiculous gesticulations of age struck my me∣mory so forcibly that the picture is yet as fresh as if it had been painted yesterdayAs  moral representations  I cannot say I think Shakespear's plays are models There is a fund of nature in themvast invention and a variety of passions admi∣rably coloured I wish I could for∣get the loose fancy which wantons through most of them and is ex∣tremely disagreeable to a chaste ear  But what I chiefly remark is that I do not  commonly  find in them what I should wish to find in  every  play some virtue or good quality set in an amiable light or some vice or folly set in a detestable one and made as it were the burden of the whole I call the scenes of Falstaff admirable copies from nature but I know not what instruction they give Now I should wish to turn the playhouse into a mode of amusing instruction and to suffer no theatrical perform∣ance which did not eminently con∣duce to this end Young men for instance are apt to be led away by vicious pleasures and to supply their  profligacy are often carried from one degree of wickedness to another A play on such a subject  There was afterwards a play formed on this very plan intitled George Barnwell the moral of which is good though the execution is far from being faultless  might per∣haps deter many a young man in the beginning of his career Or a good effect might be produced by placing some virtue in opposition to its contrary vice as  contrasts  generally have more force than  simple exhibi∣tions  I asked the Dean if he meant to exclude comedy from his theatre  By no means said he I should rather encourage it more than tra∣gedy inasmuch as I should have more hope of curing such vices and follies as require the lash than such as require the gibbet My stageau∣thors should deal much in ridicule which when well conducted and not thrown on individuals but cast broad∣ly on vice and folly I conceive to be an admirable engine But I should not ridicule a squinting eyea stam∣mering voicea provincial dialect the peculiarities of a professionor indeed any oddity or deformity that was not strictly immoral  I am afraid said I Sir you will cut off much of our modern wit by this severity for these oddities are in general a great source of it The broken English of a Frenchman the blunders of an Irishmanor the broad dialect of a Scotsman are what our modern theatres are taught to believe very witty I shall however to speak for one think myself much obliged to you for ridding the stage of all this trumpery of false wit and hu∣mour and bringing only such ridicu∣lous characters forward as can  support themselves  if I may so speak by their real follies and vicesBut there is one thing which I fear will incapaci∣tate  the stage from being of much use in the reformation of manners The scenery the dresses the musick and other appendages of the theatre make the expence so great that it can never be brought to a level with the pockets of the multitude  That is well urged said the Dean I thank you for the hint and will im∣mediately model my dramatic repre∣sentations in conformity to itWe have one church for rich and poor All pay equal homage to one God all are equally his creaturesand it is fit we should all worship him in  one placeBut though we have only one church there is no necessity to have only one theatre In my Utopia there∣fore I mean to establish twoone for the higherthe other for the lower orders of the community In the first of course there will be more elegance and more expence and the drama must be suited to the audience by the representation of such vices and follies as are found chiefly among the great The other theatre shall be equally suited to the lower orders And to enable them the better to partake of the moral amusement pro∣vided for them I mean to abolish all  tumblingdancingbearbaiting and every thing else that tends only to encourage  merriment without instruction  You have now said I Sir perfectly satisfied me I shall heartily rejoice in the erection of your two theatres And it gives me great delight to hear you speak so favourably of the drama I own if there is any one amusement which appears to me superior to all others it is to see a good play well acted  But hold said the Dean you un∣derstand I hope that I give this commendation only to theatres of my  own regulating not to such as at present exist With a few excep∣tions I think I may describe the drama of the present age  It must be observed that the drama of that age was exceedingly corrupt Charles the Second had introduced great licence into the theatre Bad as the stage still is in this respect it is much chaster than it was then  as having no∣thing less in its view than good mo∣rals Amorous scenesvicious prin∣ciplesthe most indelicate language debauched characters set off in agreeable coloursscoffs thrown out against religion and moralswith light music tending to soften the mind  and make it still more susceptible of those vile incentives that had already been excited are too much I fear the ingredients of our theatrical amuse∣ments And even if the play were good and tended to give the thoughts any virtuous impression the light farce coming after would throw the whole at once out of the mind All farces I should recommend to my lower theatre The style of all its com∣positions should be somewhat in this way But they should all certainly have a moral tendency The sarce as at present used is a most absurd excrescence and I suppose intended merely to please the vulgar As there  is an upper gallery the people there must be pleased as well as those in the boxes But my two theatres will render this double mode of represen∣tation unnecessaryIn short if the stage were regulated as I could wish it even clergymen almost might be actors upon it As it is now ma∣naged they cannot well I think be innocent spectators Tacitus I re∣member somewhere speaking of the modesty of the German ladies attri∣butes it in a great measure to their not being suffered to attend public diversions  The words of the original are  Nullis spectaculorum illecebris nullis conviviorum irrita∣tionibus corruptae  I should wish only to  make one improvement on this Ger∣man fashion which is neither to per∣mit gentlemen nor ladies to attend them till they are better regulated The historian might have reference to the public amusements of  his own  country with which he thought it happy the German ladies had no opportunities of being corrupted Whatever his precise meaning was it shews his general opinion of such amusements and I suppose you will allow Tacitus though not an apostle to be a very good judge of men and mannersBesides added the Dean  the very profession of a player is ren∣dered so disreputable that nobody ought to encourage it Take the matter home with you Would you wish either your son or daughter to seek a livelihood on the stage If not do you think it shews much moral rectitude to encourage in other people's children what on virtuous principles you would shudder at in your own  I told the Dean I durst not take upon me to answer his invective either against the stage or its professors I feared there was more truth in what he had said than I wished to find  A clergyman I observed must often be in the way of hearing and seeing improprieties which he cannot avoid But I allowed it certainly to be a dif∣ferent case when he went  voluntarily  into the way of these thingsI then asked the Dean what he thought of dancingassemblies and cheerful meet∣ings of other kinds  As they are at present managed said the Dean so far as I am ac∣quainted with them I should hardly allow a clergyman to attend any of them Put them under my regula∣tion and he may attend them all  For the sake of truth I replied I must say that I have attended the assemblies at our countytown not constantly indeed but very fre∣quently and I do not remember ever seeing except perhaps once or twice what the most exact person would call the least breach of decorum or good manners  I know not said the Dean what you precisely mean by the least breach of decorum but before I should give my sanction to the assemblies at your countytown I should wish to ask a few question Is all company that are well dressed promiscuously ad∣mitted  or admitted on the introduction of nobody can tell whoIs there no vying in dress and ornament and fashionAre no cardtables intro∣ducedAre suppers and drinking and late hours excludedWhile you are dancing or carding or drink∣ing above stairs is any care taken of your poor servants belowAre they left to saunter about innyards and taphouses to get into bad companyor not knowing what to do with them∣selves to debauch one another Unless you can answer me rationally on all these heads I shall never suffer any cler∣gyman over whom I have influence to attend any of these meetings It may  difficult perhaps to prevent the layman from filling the heads of his sons and daughters with dress and vanity and folly and intrigue and all the imper∣tinence that attends such promiscu∣ous illregulated assemblieswe must leave him if he please to set them an example himself and go before them in all these scenes of dissipationwe must leave him also to take no more care of the morals of his servants than if they were his cattle and to pay no attention to the difficulties into which he leads them If he will run into these  excesses  I have no better word in my dictionary to explain my meaning I cannot prevent it but certainly I  should wish the clergyman to be very cautious how he gives any encourage∣ment to such assemblies by his exam∣ple The world may laugh at him but he must learn to bear the ridicule of the world and I hope in return he will meet approbation elsewhere  But said I Sir I have often heard that prudent fathers and mothers con∣sider these meetings as places where their daughters are seen to most ad∣vantage  Aye replied the Dean I have late∣ly heard that subject discussed in all its folly by one of these prudent mo∣thers  to whom I was weak enough to give my advice on this head for the sake of an amiable goddaughter of mine I hate the idea of carrying young women like colts to a fair It is indelicate it is below their dig∣nity They should not seek but be sought after Few happy marriages I believe are founded on these hasty impressionsI shall not however say more on this point as I am not instructing the world at large but only giving advice to my brethren of the clergy Let the beau suit him∣self with a belle and choose a wife from the madeup young ladies who are taught to say smart things and  shine at assemblies and whose heads are fuller of fashions than of such knowledge as most becomes them But when the clergyman thinks it prudent to change his condition let him look for a wife in some domestic family and endeavour to choose one whom he hears sober people com∣mend for her private virtues And if she happen to be known in any polite circle and dignified by the name of a  lifeless inanimate thing  he has still the better chance for happiness  As I was always fond of dancing I did not care to let the argument wholly drop and told the Dean I  hoped he had no dislike to dancing in  itself  but only when it was impro∣perly circumstanced It appeared to me a very innocent winterevening amusement  It appears so to me said the Dean I have already told you that if you will suffer me to regulate your dan∣cings and other eveningmeetings I will freely indulge you in them Summon an assembly when you please at some  private  house  Public  houses always lead to promiscuous company and intemperance Let the meeting consist of welleducated and welldisposed young people of  both sexes and when the music strikes up and the dance begins send for me and I will hobble away as fast as my gouty feet will allow and if I may be permitted quietly to occu∣py a corner of the room in an elbowchair I shall enjoy the scene as much as any of you To see youth and innocence made happy amidst such amusements as are suitable to them always gives a new joy to my philan∣thropy which is as suddenly injured when I see them entangled in plea∣sures which I cannot but look upon as secret snares for their innocence And yet I cannot say I should wish to see a clergyman except perhaps a  very young one more than a specta∣tor of these amusements To see him today sailing about in a minuet step and tomorrow preaching in a pulpit might make a contrast perhaps too strong for some of his hearers I do not however wish to determine precisely The amusement is cer∣tainly innocentWith regard to the other meetings you mention if you put them under the same rational re∣straint I have no objection to any of them I should be pleased to meet a set of virtuous wellbred young men or a mixed company either at dinner or supper and if their chief end were either conversation or innocent amusement  I should do the best in my power to amuse and enliven them Nor should I expect them all to be men of agreea∣ble manners ingenuity and informa∣tion I should only indulge the hope of their having the same dislike that I had to transgress the rules of de∣cency and proprietyBut as for clubs met together on set purpose to be joyousto drink and to rattleto sing songs and catchesto roar and stagger as the evening gets late I hold them in abhorrence No clergy∣man  Johnson and his friend Beauclerk were in company with several clergymen who thought they should appear to advantage by assuming the lax jollity of men of the world Johnson who they expected would be entertained sat grave and silent for some time At last turning to Beauclerk he said by no means in a whisper "The merriment of these parsons is mighty offensive"  Bos Life  vol iii p  should ever join in such orgies  and I should think very meanly of him if he should frequent a com∣pany that had the least tendency to that riotous mirth which produces these improprieties of behaviour  You seemed to mention said I Sir with a mark of disapprobation songs and catches Do you see any  thing particularly mischievous in them  By no means replied the Dean when they are not found in bad com∣pany and when the words are such as neither countenance vice nor violate decorum If the select as∣sembly we just left dancing choose to amuse themselves after their dance or after supper with singing I should not only approve it but beg leave to listen to them Even the clergyman I will allow to sing in such an assem∣bly though I should warmly reprove him if he should sing for the enter∣tainment of a mixed company or at  a public meetingIf I should not be thought precise or puritanical I should now and then recommend a psalmtune especially on a Sunday evening We have several psalmtunes which are very fine and when sung in parts by sweet female voices are in my ear more harmonious than any other species of music and in the language of our great but unfashionable poet  At that day Milton on the account of his political principles was not in general esteem    Divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven  At the same time I cannot say I am a friend to instrumental music on a Sundayevening from no objection to the thing itself though indeed I think harmonious voices sweeter when unaccompanied but I should fear its being misconstrued by un∣distinguishing people to whom we should always be careful not to give offence Psalms are sung in churches and can lead into no mistake but fiddles and flutes and harpsichords are merry instruments and in some peo∣ple's opinion can never be accommo∣dated to purposes of devotion  Occiduus is a pastor of renown  When he has prayed and preached the sabbath down  With wire and catgut he concludes the day  Quav'ring and semiquav'ring thought away  The full concerto swells upon your ear  All elbows shake  Will not the sickliest sheep of every flock  Resort to this example  If apostolic gravity be free  To play the fool on Sund  ys why not we  If he the tinkling harpsichord regards  As inoffensive what offence in cards  Strike up the fiddles let us all be gay  Laymen have leave to dance if parsons play  COWPER    As to  catches  I know little of them but from what I do know they make no attempt either at sense or senti∣ment The harmony may be good and if the words though senseless have no illmeaning I shall not re∣probate  though I cannot commend them  Having dispatched said the Dean all our  riotous  and  cruel  amusements and likewise such as are  trifling  and  seducing  though they often as in some instances just observed intermingle with each other I should now intro∣duce you to such amusements as I think proper for a clergyman but as the evening grows late we will take an earlier hour if you please tomorrow to discuss them  END OF THE SECOND DIALOGUE  THIRD DIALOGUE  THE next day was Sunday when I happened to be wholly engaged But on Monday I waited on the good Dean soon after dinner  I am impatient said I Sir to have another conversation with you You have taken from me my gun and my dog You have prohibited my playing at cards and have refused me leave to  go to an assembly or to meet my friend at a tavern and I cannot but be solicitous to know what amusement you will at length allow me  But are not you replied the Dean rather unreasonable I have indeed taken your gun But as to your dog you may keep him if you please for a companion I have no objection Have I not at least  connived  also at your fishing Have I not intro∣duced you to many agreeable socie∣ties Have I not given you leave to sing and to dance And does not all this satisfy you However I  mean still to do more I wish only to make your amusementsyour habits your companyyour dressand your profession all agreeBy the way I am not a little solicitous about the dress of a clergyman which I think a matter of more consequence than the generality of people will perhaps allow I think it an argu∣ment of great lightness in a clergy∣man to endeavour as far as he can to adopt the layhabit He shews he has embraced his own profession only for reasons of convenience and in his heart dislikes its restraints I should wish to have every clergyman especially when in full orders obliged  to appear always in a short cassock under his coat He could not then so easily adopt improprieties in his dress and might be more upon his guard also against improprieties in his behaviour His clerical habit would be a continual call upon him for de∣corum as he durst not in that garb do many things which dressed like a layman he might be tempted to do Besides it might tend to keep such young men out of the church as when in it are a disgrace both to it and to themselves Cloathing was originally intended for the sake of de∣cency and warmth In civilized so∣cieties it became afterwards of use to  distinguish ranks and if in this in∣stance the distinction were a little more enforced it would I am per∣suaded have a good effect  I hope Sir said I that my wardrobe if it were all produced before you would give you no offence Nothing would be found there but what is strictly clerical Indeed I myself have been often highly offended at the improper dress of many of my younger brethren I wonder not therefore at  your  being offended  So far then answered the Dean I may presu  e upon you a  a hopeful  disciple and that as you are clerical in your dress you will be clerical also in your amusementsNow as  exer∣cise  on which health so much depends is one great end of amusement and as the clerical life may in general be called a sedentary one he who pro∣vides amusements for a clergyman should have an especial view to exer∣cise But though I forbade the cler∣gyman to gallop after hounds I have no objection to his mounting his horse and riding a dozen miles in a morning for exercise  But without some end in view I  observed few people were fond of a solitary ride  Solitary ride exclaimed the Dean Have you forgotten the philosopher's noble adage  Nunquam minus solus quam cum solus  I should allow a man brought up in business to urge such a pretence but in a scholar I can∣not admit it The very trot of a horse is friendly to thought It beats time as it were to a mind engaged in deep speculation An old acquaintance of mine used to find its effect so strong that he valued his horse for being a little given to stumbling I know  not how far he would say I might carry my contemplation and to∣tally forget myself if my honest beast did not now and then by a false step jog me out of my reverie and let me know that I had not yet gotten above a mile or two out of my road  This story was afterwards told of Dr Youngnot the author of the Nightthoughts but another clergyman of that name remarka∣ble for simplicity of character and absence of mind    But every scholar said I Sir has not the art of keeping his thoughts so collected The trotting of a horse even without stumbling  may be enough to dissipate his best meditations  If he cannot think answered the Dean in one way let him think in another If he cannot lay premises and conclusions together and make a sermon let him consider some letter he has to writeor some con∣ference with a neighbour to manage He must be a very thoughtless fellow if he have not some useful topic to en∣gage his thoughts Or perhaps he may have some friend to call upon At worst he may amuse himself with looking at the country around him It is a pleasure to see how differently  the corn or the grass grows in differ∣ent parishes and to mark its pro∣gress Every season furnishes some new and agreeable scene He sees the woods assume one appearance in the springanother in summer a third in autumnand a fourth in winter And as nature is never at a stand he sees a continual variation in her scenes So that if he have no resources in himself he may still find them in the beauties of nature  But perhaps I objected he is not fond of riding or he may not be able to keep a horse  Let him walk then said the Dean I should recommend walking to him as every way a preferable exercise Over the horseman he will enjoy many advantages He is instantly equipped He has only to take his hat and stick and call his dog Be∣sides he need not keep the highway like the horseman He goes over the stilehe gets into the devious path he wanders by the side of the river or through the meadand if these sequestered scenes do not make him think I know not what can do it Besides he may use as  much  exercise in half the time which is of conse∣quence to a scholarand I should  suppose as  wholesome  exerciseBut above all things I should wish him to get a habit of thinking methodically as he walks It will soon become as easy to think in the fields as at his desk and he will enjoy at once the double advantage of study and exer∣cise Here again he has an advan∣tage over the horseman He has his hands at liberty to manage his memorandumbook and his blacklead pencil which with the incum∣brances of a whip and a bridle is more difficult To think methodi∣cally  on horseback  is the work rather of a strong head which can con∣tinue  and carry on an argument digest it in the mindand remember the several parts and dependences of it  On foot  the memorandumbook eases the head of all this trouble by fixing the argument as it proceeds For myself the exercise of walking with a memorandumbook in my hand hath ever been among the first pleasures of my life When I was a young man and could go among my poor neighbours I had three em∣ployments at the same time visiting my parishstudyingand using ex∣ercise I have made in these excur∣sions many a sermon The greatest  part of this book  The  Origines Sacrae  which the Dean had just been correcting  was first rudely composed in the fields and when I came home I always digested what had occurred in my walkconsulted my authorities and wrote all fair over And even since I grew old when it pleases God to allow me the use of my feet I still continue the same exercise only instead of being able as I was then to take a fatiguing excursion without paying much at∣tention to roads or weather I am obliged now to shorten my walk to rest a little and divide it into por∣tions  to creep along easy pathsin gardenwalks or under sheltering hedges  Much do I wish said I Sir that you could continue with more ease your useful walks in which the world hath so much partaken and will long partakeFor myself I shall certainly endeavour to imitate an example which I am convinced is so profitable I will immediately get a memoran∣dumbook and hope in time to find more pleasure in bringing home the head of a sermon than I have often done in bringing home a pheasant or a partridgeBut still Sir there  are many pious and good clergymen who may be great blessings to their parishes and yet were never able to compose a sermon themselves and cannot perhaps by any means induce a habit of thinking methodi∣callyWhat are they to do  Why they must endeavour said the Dean as I advised the horseman in the same circumstances to find em∣ployment for their thoughts as they are able If they are visiting a poor neighbour in sickness or distress they may think what to say on the occasion The duties of his parish will always be a call to exercise and engage a  worthy clergyman to be frequently abroad in one shape or other espe∣cially if his parish be extensive He may also take a book and read at intervals which will always furnish some employment for his thoughtsI have heard Sir Roger speak of the mode of exercise used by his late friend Dr Bret He would generally during two hours every day sally out into the fields with his spud in his hand and cut up all the weeds he could meet with A field of thistles was to him a sporting country and he used to say good man when he was inclined to boast a little of his benevolent exercise that he believed  he did not save his parishioners less than a dozen pounds every year in weedingBut if walking after all except when some end or parishduty is in view cannot be made plea∣sant to a clergyman let him seek other exercise Does he love a garden There cannot be a more clerical amusement than the cultivation of it The flowergardenthe fruitgarden or the kitchengarden may all afford him great amusement and are perfectly consistent with his character I should think it no discredit to a cler∣gyman to have his vines and his fruittrees better trained by his own hands than those of any professed gardener  in the country and even his pease and beans and cabbages to be in a more flourishing conditionIf he wish for still stronger exercise let him roll his walks or dig his ground  usque ad suderem  This will be of great use to him for besides the advantage of it it will enable him to take as much exercise in a couple of hours as will serve him for the dayIt is a wise provision in the statutes of some monastic houses to ob  ige their mem∣bers to employ themselves in manual labour during so many hours in the fourandtwenty Nothing can con∣tribute more to give them spirits and rid them of the spleen I have heard  that the founder of the famous abbey of La Trappe in prescribing this kind of discipline to his convent used to say that as labour was origi∣nally laid on man as a punishment for sin we may be assured it is one of the best means of keeping us out of it  I admire his wisdom said I in making the rules of his convent an antidote to the natural indolence of a cloister And I think our church in giving the clergyman a glebe hath had something of this kind in its eye I suppose you have no objection to  his making the culture of it his amuse∣ment  None replied the Dean if the sell∣ing of his corn and hay do not lead him to bargain among low people at markets I have no objection to  any  innocent rural employment For myself when I lived in the country I had great pleasure in all these things I used to see my horses and cows foddered used to visit them in their pastures and fed my poultry myself But there are few circumstances in which I should advise a clergyman to gather his own tithe It is an odious business  I asked the Dean if he had any objection to  botany  as an inducement to draw us abroad  Not the least said he if it  be  an inducementto me it would be none though it is certainly very innocent and if I should judge from the num∣bers who study it very interesting also To examine the beauty and construction of plantstheir infinite varietyand their several uses I can easily conceive might furnish much rational amusement But merely to give them hard names when they already have easy ones and to  class them botanically  which is in fact to  class them so that nobody but a botanist can find them out appears to me something like writing an English grammar in Hebrew You explain a thing by making it unintelligible I must speak however with caution on a subject of which I know so little  This censure of botany seems to respect Mr Ray who was contemporary with Dr Stillingfleet and the only botanist of note I believe at that time    I then asked the Dean what he thought of bowls tennis and cricket as clerical amusements  With regard to bowls said he I am a party concerned and therefore improperly called upon either as an advocate or an evidence I always liked a game at bowls and thought it good exercise in a summerevening It is just exercise enough to give the body a gentle breathing without being too violent With regard to tennis and cricket I must be silent for ano∣ther reason I know nothing of either of them To none of these exercises however I have any objection if the party which joins you in them be well chosen It is this which makes them innocent or seducing  The Dean did not perhaps know that there are few tenniscourts which are not places of public resort Every amusement so circum∣stanced he would certainly have interdicted    I think said I Sir we have now exhausted all such amusements as go under the name of  exercise  and I cannot but acknowledge you have been more liberal on this subject than I expected If you will be as indul∣gent to us in our  domestic amusements  we shall have no reason to complain What gratification Sir on this head are you disposed to allow us  All that is necessary replied the Dean For my own part I know not what mental amusement men of  science and information want after a studious day except that of con∣versing with each other Nothing gives the mind a more pleasing relax∣ation You need not talk much if you are indisposed and listening to good sense is no fatigueNor does any thing excite genius so much as this collision among learned men We are equally pleased with feeling our own sentiments corrected as it is done in a manner by ourselves and with correcting the sentiments of others These meetings among learned men may be called the  Fair of learning  They purchase commo∣dities of each other One man ex∣changes  changes his wit for another's know∣ledge and each probably gains what he wants at the expence of some∣thing in which he aboundsFrom this kind of communication too we get a variety of hints which we may afterwards turn to use and that with∣out the fatigue of thinking as other people think for us I knew an in∣genious man who read little himself but kept much good company and had the art of picking up and turn∣ing to account every thing he heard By expanding these hints and throw∣ing beautiful lights and images upon them by the help of a good imagina∣tion he would write a sermon or an  essay which might be called entirely his own though his friends who lived much in the same company with him could now and then dis∣cover how he came by his leading ideasI should not however advise any young man to seek his knowledge in this vague way It is a hundred to one he is not qualified for it Be∣sides it is an indolent way when you rest solely upon it In his books he will always meet with instruction  If the pleasure said I Sir arising from the company of learned men could be enjoyed in its full purity it would indeed be a relaxation beyond  all others Where tempers are well harmonized I can conceive nothing more delightful But as in chemical mixtures one single heterogeneous in∣gredient often puts the whole mass into a ferment so in these learned societies one man who talks inces∣santly or disputes eagerly destroys all the pleasure of the meeting and makes us think we might have em∣ployed our time more happily with our own solitary meditations For myself indeed I have seldom mixed freely with any one set of people among whom some or other has not been of this troublesome description At college I remember several such  intruders on the social pleasures of an evening  It is very true answered the Dean noisy talking and eager disputing are two great evils in conversation and are often found more or less in the meetings even of learned and inge∣nious men And it is a miserable thing when a man's self is the only person pleased with hearing his own conversation Nay I will go farther and allow that this is not the only evil which infests these societies There are other things which often render them disagreeable A friend of mine told me lately that  in a capital town in England he was a member of a very reputable society consisting of several men of taste and science He was delighted with their conversation and thought his time very profitably spent He soon how∣ever found that one or two of the members of this society had a deisti∣cal turn This might have been en∣dured if they would have kept their sentiments to themselves and dis∣cussed only points of literature But they were forward on all occasions to move questions on religious sub∣jects and would discuss them with very offensive licence My friend therefore seeing no remedy left his  company and consorted no more with a society where he could not receive pleasure without a great mix∣ture of pain And indeed I must al∣low with you there are so many things which make these general meetings of literati disagreeable that I know not whether as far as mere relaxation is concerned one has not a better chance for it in the mixed com∣pany of wellbred people of both sexes I should at least wish for no more than three or four in a society of select friends to make it agree∣able  But said I Sir there are many of  us poor curates who have few oppor∣tunities of getting into company of any kind who live in lonely places and see few besides the peasants of our own parishes What resources have you for us  Why in the first place answered the Dean the peasants of your parish are in many respects the properest company you can keep You will not mingle with their pleasures and diversions But the good pastor will often find leisure to enter their houses and cottages and see and hear what they are about and in this duty he will find his amusement On this  head however I need not instruct  you  Besides added he we are rather going from the question We are not considering amusement as united  with  duty but as a relaxation  from  itAre you musical I know no amusement so adapted to the clerical life as musick And indeed not only as an amusement but as a mean often as Saul used it to drive away the evil spirit Sedentary men are subject to nervous complaints and I have known many a man who could at any time fiddle away a fit of the spleen  I am myself said I musical enough  to have sometimes felt the relief you mention though I can on no instru∣ment charm any ears but my own  And what other ears replied the Dean do you wish to charm To tell you the truth I should think ex∣cellence rather a disadvantage I have known several clergymen who were masters of musick get into dis∣agreeable connections by being called on frequently to assist in concerts with people whom it would have been more prudent to avoidWe are willing indeed to suppose that mu∣sick makes a part of our heavenly enjoyments but on earth I am per∣suaded  it is sometimes found among very unharmonized souls It may drive away a fit of the spleen or mo∣derate some momentary passion but I fear it has not often much effect in meliorating the heart by subduing inordinate affectionsIf therefore continued the Dean you can fiddle so as to amuse yourself I should desire no more  I hope then said I Sir my acquire∣ments in this art will not displease you for they are very far from the point of excellenceBut I am chiefly solicitous to have your opinion on a still more favourite amusement which  is  drawing  It has given agreeable employment to many a solitary hour in my life and I should be sorry to be debarred the exercise of it  I have no intention said the Dean to debar you from it But I must give you one piece of advice As you are fond both of musick and drawing I should not wish you to practise both One of these  do∣mestic amusements  I should think might find sufficient employment for your leisureThis piece of advice is from myself But I am not un∣qualified to give you other instruction I have no knowledge of the art my∣self  but I remember hearing an ex∣cellent judge give instruction to a young man who had a profession as you have and wished to follow draw∣ing only as an amusement In the first place I remember he advised his young friend against colouring which all dabblers are fond of To understand the harmony of colours he said required great experience and without it colouring was daubing He advised him also I recollect a∣gainst attempting history or portrait or animal life or any other branch in which  accurate delineation  was re∣quired Landscape he recommended as the easiest and most pleasing branch  which might have the farther advan∣tage of decoying him into the forest or the field to examine or copy na∣ture  I gave the Dean my best thanks for his advice Of the utility of that part which came from himself I was already convinced by experience and had determined to drop one of my amusements as I found I could not without too great an expence of time follow both With regard to the other part of his advice I lamented that it had never been given me be∣fore I owned I was a dabbler and had daubed over many a sheet of  paper But if I continue said I to practise drawing I shall entirely lay aside my colours and practise my art such as it is in a way that may give me more satisfaction though perhaps Sir I shall please you better by not aiming at any excellence at all  If you allude replied the Dean to what I said about musick you mistake my meaning My great objection to your obtaining excel∣lence in musick is lest it should mislead you into improper company Its sister art is of a more solitary na∣ture and is not liable to that incon∣venience Except for this reason  and the fear of too much expence of time I have no objection to your ob∣taining excellence in both artsBut though you should not be able to please yourself with your own profi∣ciency in drawing yet if you have a taste for the art you may be greatly amused with the works of others A clergyman near me who is now dead had a small collection of prints and drawings and when he was fatigued with study as he was a very studious man could at any time amuse him∣self with a few of his prints  But all this said I Sir requires taste and if a clergyman have no  taste for these amusements I hope you have no objection to indulge him in some amusement which does not require itin a game at chess for instance with a neighbouring vi∣car or at backgammon with the squire  In my opinion said the Dean chess is so far from being a relaxation as all amusements should be that if you are fairly matched it is a severe study It is a game in which a great variety of different movements create double the variety of different circumstances on each of which circumstances so numerous a train of consequences again depend that to provide for all  the contingences that arise from your own moves and may arise from the probable moves of your antagonist requires a mind intensely occupied in the pursuit before it and vacant from every other In short a skill in this game like mathematical knowledge may be continually advancing to per∣fection When I was Fellow of St John's I played much at chess and being fond of it I attained as I thought some degree of excellence till at length from beating all the young men at Cambridge who played with me I began to think myself the best chessplayer in England It happened on a visit to a friend in London that an old German officer  made one of the party After din∣ner we went to different amusements and it was proposed that he and I should play a game at chess as we were both known to be chessplayers I modestly threw my glove but my heart beat with a full assurance of triumph I soon however perceived that my antagonist opened his game in a manner to which I had not been accustomed This roused all my attention But while I was defending myself in one quarter for I quickly found I had to act only on the defen∣sive I received a severe blow on ano∣ther which threw me into great con∣fusion And while I was endeavour∣ing  to recover my disordered affairs the enemy broke in upon me and shamefully defeated me without giv∣ing me an opportunity of displaying one instance of my prowess I was convinced however that all this mis∣chief had befallen me from too great confidence and an incautious manner of opening my game I begged therefore another trial but it ended in the same disgrace My antagonist by this time was fully apprized what a hero he had to deal with and ex∣ulting in his success desired me to fix upon any chamber on the board I pleased and use all my strength merely to defend that single post he en∣gaged  to attack no other But in spite of all my endeavours he gave me checkmate upon that very spot Nay he did it repeatedly for my shame was now turned into admira∣tion I sat down therefore contented and endeavoured to console myself by forming the disgrace I had suffered into a lesson against presumption  I cannot in return said I Sir tell you a story of my prowess at chess but if you will give me leave I will tell you one of my perseverance I played a game with a gentleman at my own lodgings and was victorious You have taken me said he rather  inopportunely today but if you will be vacant on Thursday I shall be this way and will demand satisfac∣tion Accordingly on Thursday he came about eleven o'clock and by the time we had played three games two of which I had won his horses came to the door I cannot leave the mat∣ter thus said he if you can set any little matter before me we will go on Two games more were played when in the midst of the third a bit of roasted mutton appeared and by the time it was cold I had defeated him again I was now four or five games before him Our intercourse there∣fore with the mutton was short and  we went to work again I was still victorious when the horses returned at six This is provoking said he I cannot leave the matter thus Can I have a bed at the inn His orders to his servant now were not to bring the horses till they were sent for This was a melancholy note to me fatigued as I was already beyond measure However as I was under some obligations to the gentleman and in my own lodgings I had no choice The night ended late and the morning began early Breakfast camethe barber camedinner came all was negligently treated except the main point I sighed inwardly  and hoped this visitation would now soon have an end It lasted how∣ever all that day and I was still two games before my antagonist though I had played as carelessly as I could without discovering my indifference As the evening drew on I ex∣pected every moment to hear a message sent for the horses I was shocked with his telling me we could not part on these unequal terms As the next day was Saturday and he must of necessity he said then finish he would try his fortune once more So we continued nailed to our board till a late hour on Friday night and began again before breakfast on Sa∣turday  morning Towards the close of the day our accounts differed in one game But I was too complai∣nant to dispute the matter so the horses were sent for and I was deli∣vered from such a trial of my patience as I never before experienced  Scarce any mischief happens to us said the Dean but we have the com∣fort of thinking it might have been worse and you were happy that your friend did not come to you on Monday instead of ThursdayAs it appears however from  my  story how much time and pains are neces∣sary to obtain excellence in this game  and from  your  story how fascinating a game it isit is worth while to con∣sider how far it may be a proper amusement for a clergymanand whether it really answers the end of an amusement by unbending the mind If it only substitute one severe study for another it cannot certainly take the name of an amusement  Cowper with his usual descriptive talents  admirably portrays the ardour of a chessplayer  Who then  Would waste attention at the chequer'd board  His host of wooden warriors to and fro  Marching and countermarching with an eye  As fixed as marble with a forehead ridg'd  And furrowed into storms and with a hand  Trembling as if eternity were hung  In balance on his conduct of a pin  Let every one however judge for himself I found it too interesting to be amus∣ing to me and therefore in early life  I left it offIt is certainly however a noble game It gives us an idea of war without its guilt It gives us a just idea too of common lifeof the happy effects of prudent and cautious steps on one hand and of the fatal mischief which often attends even one false step on the other  I know not said I Sir whether such games as are made up of  skill  and  chance  together are not closer imitations of life Our most prudent plans are often defeated by events which do not depend on ourselves but arise from what we call  chance  while an illdigested plan sometimes succeeds without any aid from our own prudence Games therefore consisting partly of  skill  and partly of  chance  seem more to resemble the course of events in human life than games of  mere skill  like  chess  Certainly replied the Dean such games afford a juster picture of the  circumstances  of life but I am speak∣ing of the  conduct  of it Sometimes  it is true we are ruined by unavoid∣able calamity but more often by our own misconduct and it is this latter view of life which chess so justly resembles  Well said I Sir as you repudiate chess from the list of your clerical amusements because of its  intricacy  I hope you will take backgammon into favour because of its  simplicity  Not into my favour truly answered the Dean I know too little of it to make it a favourite I have no ob∣jection however to it but its stupi∣dity Let those play at it who like  it It seems to me a noisy rattling game fit rather to conclude an even∣ing after a foxchase than suited to the taste of men of letters and refine∣mentBut indeed I have a sort of prejudice against backgammon as it contributed to ruin the fortunes of an excellent young man with whom in early life I was intimate at college He was related to a rich old admiral and was supposed to be his intended heir which he probably might have been had not this stupid game inter∣vened Backgammon was the ad∣miral's delight He had no resources in himself As to books he hardly knew the top of a page from the bot∣tom  Backgammon was level to his genius All his powers were cen∣tered in this game Three or four hours after dinner and half that time after supper he never failed to play and all day long if the weather did not permit him to go abroad As the admiral was not a very pleasing man and besides rather penurious in his housekeeping his company was not much sought after and it fell to the unhappy lot of my friend to be his almost constant antagonist Day after dayit was weary work I re∣member well his coming to me one evening much out of humour "I have been playing with him said he  at this stupid game from four this afternoon till eight and he had the conscience towards the close of this heavy business to look me full in the face and cry Cousin you play as if you were tired"In short my friend could not bear this miserable trespass upon his time and began to make conditions The admiral was not used to controul took the huff blot∣ted him out of his will and chose a puppy for his heir who was fit for nothing but to play at backgam∣mon  A liberal minded man said I Sir is much to be pitied when his inte∣rest  rest and his sentiment are thus at va∣riance Young as I am in life I have seen several instances of it but I have seldom known as on this occasion sentiment prevailUpon the whole however Sir I think you are too harsh in your censure of backgam∣mon It is not surely a game of deep contrivance yet I think it possesses variety enough to be amusing even to an enlightened mind which wishes during a short interval to suspend its faculties and enjoy the refreshment of a little privation of sentiment What has hurt this poor harmless game I believe more than any thing else is its connection with those  wicked little cubes called  dice  which are employed in so many villainous purposes that every communication with them is suspected One of our good bishops I have heard is fond of a game at backgammon when he can get snug to it with his chaplain But he stands much in awe of his own servants lest in passing to and fro they should hear their master rattling  dice  So he plays always on a table lined with green baize and throws his dice from lined boxes  This story is told of Bishop Gibson of London but as he lived after Dr Stilling∣fleet's time I suppose the same device has been practised by other bishops    If it had been my case said the Dean I should have played openly These concealments never are con∣cealed They only shew that we have not resolution to forbear doing what on some account we do not think perfectly right For myself I see no reason why the bishop may not indulge himself in a game at backgammon without scruple if he like it As for the illrepute it lies under on the account of its connec∣tion with  dice  I see no more reason for it than that knives and forks should be objected to because they may become the instruments of gluttony It is another connection which occa∣sions  the mischief If these  little wicked cubes  as you call them were not connected with certain little  wick  d circles  called  money  they would be perfectly harmless These little  circles  are in fact the wicked companions which debauch the  cubes  and are in∣deed such mischievous companions as seldom fail to turn all amusements into vice In my Utopia therefore money shall in no degree be connect∣ed with amusement Its proper place is the market and there only it has concern  Gaming said I Sir no doubt is a very strange perversion of amusement  but is there any objection to a trifling stake which is never felt whether we win or lose and is in fact no  object  What end then said the Dean does it answer  Merely I replied to keep the at∣tention a little awake  But you must allow then answered the Dean that as far as it does keep the  attention awake  so far it is an  ob∣ject  The amusement itself it seems cannot keep the  attention awake  but wants a stimulative the love of money which makes you play with that care  and caution which the amusement it∣self could not do And is this any thing else my good friend twist and analyse it as you please but the spirit of avarice One man's  atten∣tion  cannot be  kept awake  as you phrase it without playing for a shil∣ling Another man must keep his  attention awake  with a pound A third must be enlivened by a stake of ten times as much and so on till the attention of some people must be  kept awake  by staking a patrimony You see then plainly that if the stake be so trifling as to be no  object  it can be no  incentive  and if it be an object it can only be so by your attachment to  a sum of money and what will you call that attachment unless you re∣solve it with me into the spirit of avarice  But though in theory said I Sir you may be able to lead it up to this source it seems in fact to be so tri∣fling as not to come within any moral calculation  I know the mathematician replied the Dean divides matter with such nicety as to bring it to an invisible point But I do not like to see mo∣rals so treated Is the  excess  wrong If it be the  approach  cannot be right  If the mind be  at all  infected with the spirit of  avarice  and the desire of pro∣fiting by your neighbour's loss it is so far an  approach  There are differ∣ent degrees of vice no doubt but we are cautioned against breaking one of the  least commandments  as well as the greatest The good Christian en∣deavours to preserve his mind from the smallest taint and the Christian minister thinks himself particularly bound to abstain from every  appear∣ance of evil  In fine I will not cavil with you whether playing for money arises from avarice but certainly the  amusement  ceases when it cannot itself produce its end and  what does pro∣duce  the end  becomes the leading principle So that the point issues here if you choose such feeble amusements as are really no amuse∣ments without the aid of vicious sti∣mulativesit becomes you to lay them aside and seek for such amuse∣ments as are simply such  To be candid I replied I have nothing farther Sir to oppose Vi∣cious custom I fear hath modified all our amusements as well as every thing else and hath driven them from their natural simplicity connecting things with them that have no rela∣tion to them I cannot but allow  with you that amusements should be simply such and that if they connect themselves with money they should assume another nameI then put the Dean in mind that he had yet fur∣nished us with no  domestic amusement  that came under the name of  exercise  Rainy weather I observed might continue so long as to make a little motion necessary to a sedentary man Do you object to billiards  Why no said the Dean not much My own method when I could not take exercise abroad was to throw two or three doors open and walk from one chamber to another with a  book or scrap of paper in my hand as I used to do in the fields But I do not prescribe my own example to others As to billiards they are so unhappily connected with gaming and bad company that I have no great respect for the amusementat least as a clerical one However as the influence of this game from its expensive apparatus cannot be so ex∣tended as cards I should not object to a clergyman's playing at it in a pri∣vate family and under the usual re∣striction of playing only with good company and for no stake  I am obliged to you said I Sir  for the liberty you have given me of indulging an amusement which is a favourite one with me and in which I am supposed to have some skill  Nay then replied the Dean I know not whether I shall not revoke the liberty I have given you I am not fond of a clergyman's  possessing skill  in any game Skill always implies a consumption of time and an eager∣ness after an amusement which I can∣not approve  But you have now said I Sir given me so much good instruction that  whatever I may have done I hope never again either to employ my time in improving my skill or to use my skill in mispending my timeI then asked the Dean if he had ever heard of the game of shuttlecock or if he would laugh at me for mentioning it to him as good  domestic exercise  Laugh at you said the Dean I know no game that I value more It has all the characters of the amuse∣ment we want It gives us good exerciseit makes us cheerfuland has no connection with our pockets and if I may whisper another truth in your ear it does not require  much skill  to learn When my legs were in better order I have spent many a rainy halfhour with Sir Roger at shuttlecock in his hall The worst of it is few parsonage houses have a room large enough for it though perhaps the tithebarn if it be not better employed may furnish one I could say more in favour of shuttle∣cock You may play at it alone It is also an exercise too violent to last long We need not fear as at bil∣liards to mispend a morning at it Laugh at you so far from it that I respect the man who invented shuttlecoek  I asked the Dean next if he had any objection to some little handi∣craft business as  domestic exercise  for a clergyman And I particularised that of a carpenter or a turner both which I said were very well fitted to put the blood in motion  Aye aye replied the Dean I like them both I have known very worthy clergymen good carpenters and turners I knew one who had a shop in his house and made his own tables and chairs They were sub∣stantial and not illmade though he did not think them neat enough for his parlour they did very well for his  chambers and study I knew another clergyman added the Dean and an exemplary man he was who was an excellent turner He used to work in box ebony and ivory and made a number of little pretty conveniences both for himself and his friends In the coldest weather I have heard him say he could put his whole frame in a glow by working his latheDid not you see in the prints that Mons Pascal who died the other day had retired a few years ago to the learned seminary of PortRoyal where he and other eminent men made it a rule to intermix their studies with manual labour  I told the Dean I had seen it and that I rather wondered at the choice which Pascal had made of his own em∣ployment which was that of making wooden shoes  Aye good man said the Dean he made them for the poor peasants in his neighbourhood and I should be glad to give more than double their value for a pair of them to keep for his sake  I then mentioned bookbinding to the Dean as a clerical art  Why yes said he I think it is  but we should have introduced it ear∣lier in our conversation under the head of  domestic amusement  it will hardly come under that of  domestic exercise  Well have you any thing more to offer You see I am disposed to allow my brethren every mode of amusement and exercise that is con∣sistent with innocence and propriety of manners and I hope the range which may be taken within these bounds will be thought fully suffi∣cient If I have omitted any thing or if you have any thing farther to propose let me know  I recollect nothing said I Sir at  present and have only left to ex∣press my grateful obligations to you for what is past If any thing farther should occur I shall take the liberty on some future occasion to propose it In the mean time I am perfectly satisfied myself with the indulgence you have given me and should think any of my brethren unreasonable who should desire more  END OF THE DIALOGUES  THIS is the substance of what passed between the Dean of Paul's and me on the subject of  clerical amusements  As  our conversation lasted three evenings I had the more leisure to commit it to writing The force of many of the Dean's expressions I fear is injured in an account which depended so much on memory but I dare take upon me to say the sentiments are invariably his  As this conversation gave a new turn to all my own amusements it enabled me also to be of some service in giving occasional advice to several of my younger brethren and if my executors should find these papers and think them worth communicating to the public I should hope they might be of use also to others after I am gone  JOS FRAMPTON  THE END
