 BISHOP BONNER's GHOST  STRAWBERRYHILL PRINTED BY THOMAS KIRGATE MDCCLXXXIX  THE ARGUMENT  IN the gardens of the palace at Fulham is a dark recess at the end of this stands a chair which once belonged to bishop BonnerA certain bishop of London more than years after the death of the aforesaid Bonner just as the clock of the gothic chapel had struck six undertook to cut with his own hand a narrow walk thro' this thicket which is since called the  monk's walk  He had no sooner begun to clear the way than lo suddenly upstarted from the chair the ghost of bishop Bonner who in a tone of just and bitter indignation uttered the following verses  BONNER's GHOST  REFORMER hold ah spare my shade  Respect the hallow'd dead  Vain pray'r I see the op'ning glade  See utter darkness fled  Just so your innovating hand  Let in the moral light  So chas'd from this bewilder'd land  Fled intellectual night  Where now that holy gloom which hid  Fair truth from vulgar ken  Where now that wisdom which forbid  To think that monks were men  The tangled mazes of the schools  Which spread so thick before  Which knaves intwin'd to puzzle fools  Shall catch mankind no more  Those charming intricacies where  Those venerable lies  Those legends once the church's care  Those sweet perplexities  Ah fatal age whose sons combin'd  Of credit to exhaust us  Ah fatal age which gave mankind  A Luther and a Faustus  The same age which brought heresy into the church unhappily introduced printing among the arts by which means the scriptures were unluckily disseminated among the vulgar  Had only Jack and Martin  How bishop Bonner came to have read Swist's Tale of a Tub it may now be in vain to inquire  liv'd  Our pow'r had slowly fled  Our influence longer had surviv'd  Had laymen never read  For knowledge flew like magic spell  By typographic art  Oh shame a peasant now can tell  If priests the truth impart  Ye councils pilgrimages creeds  Synods decrees and rules  Ye warrants of unholy deeds  Indulgencies and bulls  Where are ye now and where alas  The pardons we dispense  And penances the sponge of sins  And Peter's holy pence  Where now the beads which us'd to swell  Lean virtue's spare amount  Here only faith and goodness fill  A heretic's account  But softwhat gracious form appears  Is this a convent's life  Atrocious sight by all my fears  A prelate with a wife  Ah sainted Mary  An orthodox queen of the th century who laboured with might and main conjointly with these two venerable bishops to extinguish a dangerous heresy ycleped the reformation  not for this  Our pious labours join'd  The witcheries of domestic bliss  Had shook ev'n Gardiner's mind  Hence all the sinful human ties  Which mar the cloyster's plan  Hence all the weak fond charities  Which make man feel for man  But tortur'd memory vainly speaks  The projects we design'd  While this apostate bishop seeks  The freedom of mankind  Oh born in ev'ry thing to shake  The systems plann'd by me  So heterodox that he wou'd make  Both soul and body free  Nor clime nor colour stays his hand  With charity deprav'd  He wou'd from Thames' to Gambia's strand  Have all be free and sav'd  And who shall change his wayward heart  His wilful spirit turn  For those his labours can't convert  His weakness will not burn  Ann Dom    A GOOD OLD PAPIST  By the lapse of time the three last stanzas are become unintelligible Old chronicles say that towards the latter end of the th century a bill was brought into the British parliament by an active young reformer for the abolition of a pretended traffic of the human species But this only shews how little faith is to be given to the exaggerations of history for as no vestige of this incredible trade now remains we look upon the whole story to have been one of those fictions not uncommon among authors to blacken the memory of former ages
