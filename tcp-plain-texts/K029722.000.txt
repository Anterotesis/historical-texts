at this rate we'll tell his worship Mr Gage of you He's an exciseman and a great friend to us poor solks  Nell  What's that you say master Grinder  Come forward you sneaking sniveling sot you I think your tricks are pretty well known Was n't you caught soaking eggs in lime and water to make them pass for new ones and did not you sit in the stocks for robbing the 'Squire's rookery to make your pigeon pies  nd Woman  Well well we'll tell Mr Gage and then what will he say to you  Nell  Tell Mr Gage will you he's a pretty protector indeed he's a disgrace to his Majesty's inkhornwhile he seizes with one hand he smuggles with the otherWhy no longer ago than last summer he was a broken attorney at Rochester and came down here and bought this place with his vote and now he is both a smuggler and contractor O my conscience if I had the management of affairs I would severely punish all such fellows who would be so base as to cheat a poor soldier  nd Woman  If his worship was here you dare not say so Here he comes here he comes Now you'll change your note  Nell  Will I you shall see if I do No no I'll tell him my mind that's always my way  Enter  GAGE  All  Ah Mr Gage  Gage  Hey dey

it  Gage  Encourage you to be sure I do in the way of trade  All  Aye in the way of trade  st Woman  Yes and she has been rating the poor girl and says I dress her up thus only to make the better bargains  Gage  And e'cod you're in the right of it your  mother is a sensible old woman Well said dame put plenty in your baskets and sell your wares at the sign of your daughters face  st Woman  Aye aye so I say  Gage  RightSoldiers are testy customers and this is the market where the prettiest will always make the best bargains  All  Very true very true  Gage  To besure I hate to see an awkward gawkey come sneaking into the market with her damned halfprice countenance and is never able to get scarce double the value of her best goods  Nell  I can hold no longer are you not ashamed you who are a contractor and has the honour to carry his Majesty's inkhorn at your buttonhole to teach these poor wretches all your court tricks I'll tell you what If I was to sit on a court martial against such a fellow as you you should have had your deserts from the pilfering suttler to the head contractor you should have the cat o' nine tails and be forced to run the gauntlet from Coxheath to Warley common that you should  st Man  How durst you talk so saucily to his worship  Nell  Hold your tongue or I'll throttle you you sheep biter    collaring him    st Man  O lord your worship if you don't

coaxing caressing  Now wheedling distressing  As fortune delights to exalt or confound  Her smile or her frown  Sets them up knocks them down  Turning turning turning as the wheel goes round  II  O fie Mr Gage  Quit the tricks of the age  Scorn the slaves that to fortune false fortune are bound  Their cringes and bows  Protections and vows  Turning turning c  Exit Nell  Gage  Foolish girl not to accept a bribe and follow the example of her bettersBut who have we here  Enter  O DAUB  O Daub  Ah my little Gage to be sure I am not in luck I will not want an interpreter to shew me the views about here and by my shoul I'll force you to accept my offer  Gage  Why what's your errand  O Daub  Why upon my conscience a very dangerous one Jack the Painter's job was a fool to it I am come to take the Camp  Gage  The devil you are  O Daub  Aye and must bring it away with me in my pocket too  Gage  Indeed  O Daub  Aye here's my military chest these are my colours you know  Gage  O I guess your errand  O Daub  Then faith it's a very foolish one  You must know I got so much credit at the Fete Champetre there that little Roscius recommended me to the Managers of Drury Lane and so now I am a sort of deputy superintendant under Mr Lanturnburg the great painter that as soon as he executes a thing I always design it after him my jewel so I'm going to take a side front view of it  Gage  What then they are going to introduce the camp on the stage I suppose  O Daub  To be sure you have hit itCoxheath by candle light my jewel  Gage  And will that answer  O Daub  O to be sure it will answer when a jontlemen can have a warm seat and see the whole tote of it for two thirteens and be comfortable into the bargain Why it has cost me above three guineas already and I came the cheapest way too for three of us went halves in the Maidstone Dilly my dear  Gage  Well and how do you like the prospect  O Daub  Upon my shoul my jewel I dont know what to make o'nt so I am come to be a little farther off that I may have a nearer view of it I think it looks like my cousin O Doiley's great bleach yard in the County of Antrim    Boulard fings without    Tunder and wounds what outlandish creature is this coming here  Gage  O that is Monsieur Boulard the suttler  O Daub  Then perhaps he can help me to a bit of something to eat for I feel a sort of craving in my stomach after my journey  Gage  Why he's a very honest fellow and will be happy in obliging you Oh here he comes  Enter  BOULARD  Boul  Ah begar Monsieur Gage I am glad I have found you begar I have been through Berkshire Suffolk and Yorkshire and could not find you  O Daub  Through Berkshire Suffolk and YorkshireWhat the devil does he mean  Gage  O he means through the regiments  Boulard  By gar mounsieur Gage I must depend on you for supply I have got one two tree brigade dinners bespoke besides the fat alderman and his lady from London  Gage  Then you must send out a party of cooks to forage at Maidstone  Boulard  Parblue monsieur Gage I must look to you for by gar I have got nothing in de house to eat  O Daub  Then the devil burn me if I come to dine with you honey  Boulard  O Sire I have got every ting for you and Monsieur Gage You shall have any ting you ike in von moment  O Daub  Ah ha I tank you honey But pray now Mr Blaud if your own countrymen were to come over here would not you be a little puzzled to know which side to be on  Boulard  Puzzledparblue Monsieur I do assure you I love de English ver well and vill never leave dem vile dey are victorious and I do love mine own countrymen very well but depend on it Monsieur Gage I vill always stay with do strongest  Gage  You see Mr O Daub my friend Monsieur Boulard is divested of all national prejudice I assure you  Boulard  Prejudiceby gar I have too much honour ever to leave de English while dey do vin de battle But Monsieur Gage vill you bring your friend and taste my vine I have got every ting for you and your friend I assure you M Gage I vill never forsake de English so long as dey are victorious but if mine own countrymen were to come and make de English run I would run a little way with dem and if mine own country+men were likely to overtake dem I would stop short bow to dem and say how you do my ver good countrymen By gar I shall be ver glad to see you both so come alongbut depend  on mine honour Monsieur Gage I vill never leave de English vile dey do vin de battleNo never never    Exit    Singing  Gage  Well said Monsieur Boulard  O Daub  Your sarvant Mr Blaud though faith to do him justice he has forgot the fashion of his country for when he is determined to be a rogue he is honest enough to own it But pray what connection have you with the suttlers You are no victualler here are you  Gage  Not absolutely a victualler but I deal in various articles  O Daub  Indeed  Gage  Yes but no business is done here only by contract  O Daub  A contractor Why what the devil you are not risen to such preferment as that sure I never knew you was able to furnish any contract  Gage  Nothing more easy the circumstance depends upon the quantity not the quality I got on very well lately but at first it brought me in several confounded scrapes  O Daub  As how  Gage  Why I undertook to serve a regiment with hair powder  O Daub  Hair powder What and you sent them flower I suppose  Gage  Flower no noI should have saved nothing by that I went to the fountain headthe pit and gave 'em a plentiful stock of lime  O Daub  Lime brick and mortar lime  Gage  Yes brick and mortar lime  O Daub  And what the plague was not the cheat found out  Gage  Why at first it answered the purpose very well while the weather was fine it did charmingly but one fieldday they was all caught in a fine soaking shower the smoke ran along the lines ecod their heads were all slack'd in an instant and by the time they returned to the camp damme if  all their heads were not as smooth as an old half crown  O Daub  A very cross accident indeed  Gage  Yes I stood a near chanceof being tied up to the halberts but I excused myself by saying they looked only like raw recruits before but now they appeared like old veterans of service  O Daub  But you lost your contract I suppose  Gage  Yes but I soon got another a shaving Contract to a company of grenadiers  O Daub  'Faith I never knew you practised that business  Gage  Never handled a razor in all my life I shave by deputy hired Sam Sickle down from Londonan excellent hand handles a razor like a scythehe'll mow you down a regiment of beards in the beating a revally  O Daub  Upon my conscience a pretty way this of working at secondhand I wish myself could do a little by proxy  Gage  But come what say you for something to eat and a glass of my friend Boulard's wine and drink his Majesty's health  O Daub  With all my heart my dear and to the two camps if you will  Gage  Twowhat two do you mean  O Daub  Why the one at Coxheath and the other at Drury Lane    Exeunt  SCENE  A Grove near the Camp  Enter  TWO COUNTRYMEN  First Countryman  I TELL you I will certainly list I ha' made up my mind on't  nd C  Well well I'll say no more  st C  Besides the camp lies so convenient I mayn't have such another opportunity  nd C  Why its main jolly to be sure and all that  so fair Now if I were to list I should like hugely to belong to a regiment of horse and here is one of the grandest troop com'd lately I see'd two of the officers mighty delicate looking gentlemen they were drest quite different from the others their jackets indeed are pretty much the same but then they wear a sort of petticoat as 'twere with a large hat and feather and a mortal sight of hair I suppose now they are some of your outlandish troops your foreign Hessians or such like  st C  Aye like enough Here comes the sarjeant Ecod he can sing louder than his own drum Zooks see how brave they march Well walking is a mighty dull way of going after all  Enter  SERJEANT DRUMMER RECRUITS  c  SONG  SERJEANT  Great Caesar once renownd in fame  For a mighty arm and a laurel brow  With his  VENI VIDI VICI  came  And he conquerd the world with his row dow

and sow for the hungry Frenchmen to come and reap Come my lads let your fields lie fallow this year and I'll insure you double crops ever after Why now here's a fellow made for a soldier there's a leg for a spatterdash with an eye like the King of Prussia  st C  Aye but serjeant I hanna' the air  Serjeant  The air O we'll soon learn you that why now here's little Ralph there's a fellow for you he has not been listed afortnight and see what a presencethere's dignity O there is nothing like the drill for grace  st C  Serjeant I'm your man  nd C  And so am I  Serj  That's right my lads this is much better than to be dragg'd away like a slave or be scratch'd off the church door for the militia Now you have present pay and the bounty money into the bargain But come my lads let me ask you a few questions and then the business is done  TRIO  Ser  Yet ere you're permitted to list with me  Answer me strait twice questions three  st C  No lies master Serjeant well tell unto you  For tho' we

Nell  Well said my lads I am glad to see so many good hearts in the countryO but was not you saying one of your recruits knows me  Ser  O yes Nell a lad from suffolk Hark'ye where's the Suffolk boy as we call him O here he comes  Enter  NANCY  Nancy  Ah serjeant did you not begin to think you had lost me But come will you leave me a few minutes with Nelly  Ser  With all my heart Come my lads let's to the heart of oak where we'll drink his Majesty's health    Exit singing The answer c and two huzzas  Nancy  Why Nelly don't you know me  Nell  Know you Egad I don't know whether I do or notsure it can't beand yet sure it is Nancy Granger  Nancy  It is her my dear Nelly who kisses you now with the truest sense of gratitude for your former kindness and friendship  Nell  My dear girlOdso I must take care of my reputationBut what in the name of fancy brings you here and in this dress child  Nancy  How can you ask me that question Nelly You are no stranger to the love William and I have for each other a few days would have united us  for ever had not cruel fate separated us the regiment being ordered to march immediately no resource was then left but my flying from my father's house I procured a dress from one of our neighbours sons and that love which induced me to forsake my sex still supports me under every affliction Fortunately on my way I met the serjeant and after some entreaty was inlisted and equipped as you see What think you Nell does not my dress become me  Nell  Yes indeed I think you make a smart little soldier  Nancy  Why indeed I am rather under size but I fancy in action I could do more real execution than those who look bigger and talk louder But tell me my dear Nelly where is William I long to see him Does he ever speak of his poor Nancy sure he cannot be faithless  Nell  Why really Nancy I have some doubts  Nancy  Heavens is it possible  Nell  Ah my poor little soldier I only did it to try your affection Your William is true and worthy of your love  Nancy  You have made a greater shock on my spirits than even an army of Frenchmen could have done  AIR  When War's Alarms enticed my Willy from me  My fond heart with grief did figh  Each fresh remembrance brought fresh sorrow on me  I waked ere yet the morn was nigh  No other could delight him  Ah why did I ere slight him  Cooly answering his fond tale  Which drove him far  Amid the rage of war  And left silly me thus to bewail  But I no longer thus a maid forsaken  Nor will I mourn like yonder dove  For ere the dawn tomorrow shall awaken  I'll go seek my absent love  The distant hills all over  I'll fly to seek my lover  Scorning every threat'ning fear  Nor distant shore  Nor cannon's loud roar  Shall longer keep me from my dear  Nell  But my dear girl consider do you think you can cheerfully go through the toil and fatigue and not repine after your own happy situation you left behind you  Nancy  O no I still must love though I should regret the occassion of our difficulties  Nell  DifficultyWhy then marry him at the drum head and that will end all your difficulties  AIR  What can our wisest heads provide  For the child we doat on dearly  But a merry soul and an honest heart  In a lad who loves her dearly  Who with kisses and chat  And all all that  Will sooth him late and early  If the truth she tell  When she knows him well  She'll swear she loves him dearly  Let the prude at the name or sight of man  Pretend to rail severely  But alack a day unseen she'll play  With the lad who loves her dearly  Say old men whate'r they will  'Tis a lover still  Makes day and night roll cheerly  What makes our may  All holiday  But the lad we doat on dearly  Nell  Well my dear Nancy you must endeavour to throw off that dress as soon as possible I'll tell you what here are some ladies in the camp who condescend to notice me I'll endeavour to introduce you to them and they may be of great service to you in the mean time should you by chance meet with William besure you dont discover yourselfHush here is the serjeant  Enter  SERJEANT  Ser  Why Nelly how's this You have had a long conversation together I began to think you had run away with my new recruit  Nell  O there's no great danger serjeant he's no soldier for me pray is he perfect in his exercise  Ser  O as handy a lad as ever was Come youngster convince her    Nancy goes through the exercise    Nell  Very well indeed But serjeant I must beg of you to befriend him as much as you can for my sake  Ser  Any service in my power you may command but a soldier's life is not the easiest in the world so they ought to befriend each other  TRIO  O the joy when the trumpets sound  And the march beats around  When the steed tears the ground  And shouts to the skies resound  On glittering arms the sunbeams playing  Heighten the soldier's charms  The sife and the roll of the distant drum  Cry hark the enemy come  To arms the attack's begun  End of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  A Grove near the Camp  Enter  NELL  speaking without  WILLIAM come speak to him another time sure nothing could be more lucky however I must obey their ladyship's instructions and keep him in ignorance that they may be present at the discovery Poor fellow its almost a pity too when one has it in ones power to make him so happy  Enter  WILLIAM  Will  I am sorry Nell to make you wait but it was an old friend  Nell  Aye aye some one from Suffolk I suppose who has brought you news of your dear Nancy  Will  I wish it had it's unaccountable that I don't hear from her  Nell  Unaccountable not at all I suppose she has changed her mind  Will  No Nelly that's impossible and you would think so had you heard how she plighted her faith to me and vowed notwithstanding her parents were my enemies nothing but death should prevent our union  Nell  O I beg your pardon if her father and mother indeed are against you you need not doubt her constancy But come dont be melancholy I tell you I want to have you stay somewhere near the Inn and perhaps I may bring you some intelligence of her  Will  How dear Nell  Nell  Tho' Indeed I think you are very foolish to plague yourself so for even had Nancy loved you well enough to have carried your knapsack you would have been very imprudent to have suffered her  Will  Aye but prudence you know is not a soldiers virtue Its our business to hold life itself cheap much more the comforts of it Shew me a young fellow in our regiment who if he gains the heart of a worthy girl and afraid to marry her for want of a little wealth I would have him drummed out of the regiment for discretion  Nell  Very fine but must not the poor girl share in all your fatigues and mishaps  Will  There Nell I own is the objection but tenderness and affection may soften even these yet if my Nancy ever makes the trial though I may not be able to prevent her from undergoing hardships I am sure my affection will make her wonder at their being called so I wish I could once boast that the experiment was made  AIR  My Nancy quits the rural train  A camp's distress to prove  All other ills she can sustain  But living from her love  Yet dearest tho' your Soldier's there  Would not your spirits fail  To mark the hardships you must share  Dear Nancy of the dale  Or should you love each danger share  Ah how shall I secure  Your health 'mid toils which you are born  To soothe but not endure  A thousand perils I must view  A thousand ills assail  Nor must I tremble e'en for you  Dear Nancy of the dale  SCENE II  An open View near the Camp  Enter  O DAUB  O Daub  Well to be sure this same Camp is a pretty place with their drums and their fifes and  their gigs and their marches and their Ladies in their regimentals upon my conscience I believe they'd form a troop of sidesaddle cavalry if there was any hopes of an invasion But now I am alone by myself tis time I should be after taking my plan and here I see are some of my directions for it    pulls out a pocket book and pencil    I cant think what it is makes my hand shake so unless it is Mr Blaud's wine that is got into my head so so Let me study my orders a little for I am not used to this business O P and P S Who the devil is to understand that O here is the explanation P S the prompter's side and O P opposite the prompter So I'm to mark down the view as it is to be taken on one side and the other Very well P S and O P Let me see Somewhere hereabout is certainly the best point to take it from    retires  Enter  SERJEANT  and the  TWO COUNTRYMEN  st Countryman  There you rogues there he is  nd C  Aye aye that's him sure enough I have seen him skulking about these two days if he ben't a spy I'll suffer hanging  Ser  He certainly must be a spy by his drawing figures  nd C  Do seize on him or the whole camp may be blown up before we are aware  O Daub  Prompter's side  Ser  Hush we shall convict him out of his own mouth  O Daub  O yes the star and garter must certainly be P S  Ser  P S What the devil does he say  nd C  Treason you may be sure by your not understanding him  O Daub  And then O P will have the advantage  Ser  O P That's the old Pretender A damn'd Jacobite spy my life on't  st C  And P S is Prince Charles I suppose  Ser  No you fool P S is the Pretender's Son  nd C  Aye aye like enough  O Daub  Memorandumthe officers tents are in the rear of the line  nd C  Mark that  O Daub  N B  the Generals tents are all houses  st C  Remember that  O Daub  Then the park of Artillery I shall never make any thing of that Oh the devil burn the park of artillery  Ser  There's a villain He'll burn the park of artillery will he  O Daub  Well faith this camp is easier taken than I thought it was  Ser  Is it so you rogue but you shall find the difference on't O what a providential discovery  O Daub  To besure the people will like it much and in the course of the winter it may surprise his majesty  Ser  O the villain seize him directlyFellow you are a dead man if you stirWe seize you Sir as a spy  O Daub  A spyphoo phoo get about your business  Ser  Bind him and blinfold him if he resists  nd C  Aye blindfold him for certain and search him too I dare say his pockets are crouded with powder matches and tinderboxes at every corner  O Daub  Tunder and owns what do you mean  st C  Hold him fast  O Daub  Why here's some ladies coming who know me Here's Lady Sarah Sash and Lady Plume who were at the FeteChampetre and will give me a good character  Ser  Why villain your papers have proved you a spy and sent by the old Pretender  O Daub  O Lord O Lord I never saw the old gentleman in all my life  Ser  Why you dog did'n't you say the camp  was easier taken than you thought it was  nd C  Aye deny that  Ser  And that you would burn the artillery and surprise his majestyso come you had better confess before you are hanged  O Daub  Hanged for a spy O to besure myself is got into a pretty scrape  Ser  Bring him away but blindfold him the dog shall see no more  O Daub  I'll tell you what Mr soldier or Mr Sarjeant or what the devil's your name upon my conscience and soul I'm nothing at all but an Irish painter employed by Monsieur Lanternburg  Ser  There he has confessed himself a foreigner and employed by Marshal Leatherbag  nd C  Oh he'll be convicted by his tongue You may swear he is a foreigner by his lingo  st C  Bring him away I long to see him hanging  O Daub  Tunder and wounds If I am hanged what will become of the theatre and the managers and the devil fly away with you all together for a parcel of red blackguards    They hurry him off    SCENE  Part of the Camp  Enter  LADY GORGET LADY SASH  and  LADY PLUME  L Plume  O my dear lady Sash indeed you are too severe and I'm sure if Lady Gorget had been here she would have been of my opinion  L Sash  Not in the least  Lady Plume  You must know she has been rallying my poor brother Sir Harry Bouquet for not being in the militia and so illnaturedly  L Sash  So he should indeed but all I said was he looked so french and so finical that I thought he ran a risque of being mistaken for another female chevalier  L Plume  Yet you must confess that our situation is open to a little raillery A few elegancies of accomodation are considerably wanting though one's toilet as Sir Harry says is not absolutely spread on a drumhead  L Sash  He vows there is an eternal confusion between stores military and millinery such a description he givesOn one shelf cartriges and and cosmetics pouches and patches here a stand of arms there a file of black pins in one drawer bulletmoulds and essencebottles pistols and tweezer cases with battlepowder mixed with marechelle  L Gorget  O the malicious creature  L Plume  But pray Lady Sash don't renew it for see here comes Sir Harry to join us  Enter  SIR HARRY BOUQUET  Sir Harry  Now Lady Sash I beg a truce Lady Gorget I am rejoiced to see you at this delectable spot where Lady Plume you may be amused with such a dismal variety  L Gorget  You see Lady Plume he perseveres  L Sash  I assure you Sir Harry I should have been against you in your raillery  Sir Harry  Now as Gad's my judge I admire the place here's all the pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war Mars in a visavis and Bellona giving a FeteChampetre  L Plume  But now seriously brother what can make you judge so indifferently of the camp from any body else  Sir Harry  Why seriously then I think it the worst planned thing I ever beheld for instance now the tents are all ranged in a strait line now Lady Gorget can any thing be worse than a strait line and is not there a horrid uniformity in their infinite vista of canvas no curve no break and the avenue of marquees abominable  L Sash  O to be sure a circus or a crescent would have been vastly better  L Gorget  What a pity Sir Harry was not consulted  Sir Harry  As Gad's my judge I think so for there is great capability in the ground  Lady Sash  A camp cognoscenti possitively Sir Harry we will have you publish a treatise on military virtue  Sir Harry  Very well but how will you excuse this the officer's tents are close to the common soldiers what an arrangment is that now If I might have advised there certainly should have been one part for the canaille and the west end of the camp for the noblesse and persons of a certain rank  L Gorget  Very right I dare say you would have thought of proper marquees for hazard and quinze  L Plume  To be sure with festino tents and opera pavilions  Sir Harry  Gad the only plan that could make it supportable for a week Well certainly the greatest defect in a general is want of taste  L Sash  Undoubtedly and conduct discipline and want of humanity are no atonements for it  Sir Harry  None in nature  L Plume  But Sir Harry it is rather unlucky that the military spirit is so universal for you will hardly find one to side with you  Sir Harry  Universal indeed and the ridicule of it is to see how this madness had infected the whole road from Maidstone to London the camp jargon is as current all the way as bad silver the very postillions that drive you talk of their cavalry and refuse to charge on a trot up the hill the turnpikes seem converted into redoubts and the dogs demanded the countersign of my servants insteed of the tickets then when I got to Maidstone I found the very waiters had got a smattering of tactics for enquiring what I could have for dinner a cursed drilled waiter after reviewing his bill of fare with the air of a field marshal  proposed an advanced party of soup and bouille to be followed by the main body of ham and
