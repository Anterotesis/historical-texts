 A SEQUEL TO COMMON SENSE OR THE AMERICAN CONTROVERSY CONSIDERED IN TWO POINTS OF VIEW HITHERTO UNNOTICED  FIRSTThat Parliaments cannot be supreme in all cases whatsoever without being infallible also  SECONDThat Colonies when they find themselves com∣petent that is  come of age  may in consequence of an unanimity nay a majority of voices throw off all subjec∣tion to the originating parent state a power derived from God and authorized by the necessity of things  BY THEOPHILUS PHILADELPHUS  Inutiles amputans feliciores inserit  The SECOND EDITION corrected and enlarged  DUBLIN Printed by ALEX STUART in St  Audeon'sArch  MDCCLXXVII  PREFACE  Were Despotism's life not short as vile  Biography's chaste pages to defile  Existence were a curse from God's righthand  And everlasting Justice at a stand  THE Freedom of the Press is our glory and palladium It is indeed our national breath of existence as a free independent State It is the Heart of the Bodypolitic through which constitutional Life circulates freely and vi∣gorously giving strength exertion and activity to every member When it is obstructed partial∣ly or totally destroyed disease or death inevita∣ble ensues All nations in proportion as they en∣joy a FREEPRESS enjoy the inestimable bless∣ings of personal Liberty and proprietary possession Some have it perfect and unlimited for instance BRITAIN and BRITISH AMERICA Britain and America are therefore perfectly and without limitation a free people Some in a qualified and discretionary degree like France whose subjects accordingly taste the exquisite delights of Free∣dom just as the ruling Powers are disposed from a wellconditioned though evervarying sense of right and justice to fix the precise point of discre∣tion  and qualification Others again in the most absolute terms of despotic prohibition of which the Pontifical States are an example Rome and Italy of course are at this present time in the most deplorable state of stupified ignorance and browfallen subjection a state infinitely worse than if they had not existed as a people at all  From this short representation it is plain that no people now upon earth are possessed of Freedom in any sense worthy of Men and Christians but BRITONS in which term I would comprehend GreatBritain and Ireland America and all their widely spread dependancies now alas in a vio∣lent convulsive state of being torn and rent asunder by the councils and machinations of wicked and abandoned menWonderful and dishonourable tale that nine parts of ten of our habitable globe should have passively and patiently worn away the progressive series of more than  fifty centuries  only to become the very reverse of what God the Crea∣tor intended Man to be The contemplation of this subject plunges the human mind into a fa∣thomless reverie from which it never emerges without that irresistible influx of strong sensibilities the effect of which is always pain and debasement beyond the picturation of words Especially is the reflective philosophical soul wounded in its feel∣ings when it is considered that so enormous a disproportion of our species all along suffered them∣selves to be sunk into so wretched and brutal a state for the sake of a  few individuals  I mean kings who in the grasp of the people had the people retained any portion of the Divinity among them would have been no more than the crush of a midge under an elephant's footA sort of twofold consideration tends to deepen and invete∣rate this wound  Kings for being such far less to become ty∣rants had no original natural right whatever no right in short exclusive of the free election of the People but what the barbarian the ruffian the robber and the murderer may assume This matter is set in a clear uncontrovertible light in consequence of knowing the will and appointment of Heaven The will and appointment of Heaven we that are Christians and what is more Pro∣testants with the New Testament in our hands know perfectly Let it be premised that what latterly has been found the moral intentions of God respecting the grand line of conduct among nations and individuals was always the moral in∣tentions of God tho' not promulgated Neither is the justice of God impeachable here for not promulgating them sooner by express Revelation because the universal or endemic disease did not sooner arrive at its crisis to be cured and because in reality such a promulgation actually took place at the creation of Man under the vigorous effect of which it is well known that for many succes∣sive ages after our race had been created the Pa∣triarchal state of equality or the shepherd erratic state subsisted and flourished without any subor∣dination but what spontaneously and in the course of things resulted from parental seniority vener∣able gravity piety wisdom and experience  True matters altered for the worse very soon bad dispositions discovered themselves bad habits were contracted envy avarice jealousy and ambition seized on the human mind as a sort of prey virtuous unsuspicious equality ceased and Government with its appending evils and prone∣ness to degenerate began The first promulgated moral intentions of Heaven were consequently superceded declining gradually till at length  they became totally forgotten and absorpt in the abandoned vices and idolatry of the Heathen worldBut this brings not the Moral Law first imprinted on the heart of man into dispute for the same objection lies against Revelation itself which in its spirit and legislative government of the Christian world has been as much abused corrupted neglected and set aside as the Primary Law of Nature the creational standard of conduct ever was by the Heathen worldHaving I hope pretty clearly evinced this point the will and ap∣pointment of Heaven with regard to the present circumstances of nations remains to be ascertained  In times posterior to the Great Christian Law∣giver our test and proof must be taken from the Scriptures undoubtedly CHRIST'S little kingdom at first consisted of himself and his twelve Apostles Dictating in this kingdom which will one day be supreme over all this is his explicit command as conveying the will and appointment of Heaven throughout all generations  The princes of the Gentiles  Heathens Pagans  exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority up∣on them but it shall not be so among you but who∣soever will be great among you let him be your Mi∣nister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant  Now the point of discussion here is whether this remarkable precept so clear∣ly expressed be a general or a partial one that is comprehensive of Kings Rulers and Gover∣nors or barely restricted to individuals in obscure social life or to give it another face still whe∣ther Emperors and Kings are not as strictly and minutely bound down to the performance of all the Christian virtues of which mercy placability for∣bearance justice equity truth selfdenial and universal benevolence are the principal as the  meanest of those that are styled their subjects Who dare affirm they are not I dare affirm however novel and unpopular the affirmation they are To admit the contrary involves conclusions ruinous to the peace welfare and happiness of so∣ciety If Kings and Magistrates are not included in the Christian code of moral precepts or have an indemnification peculiar to their order for transgressing them then are tyranny and oppression the ravages of countries and devastations of king∣doms carried forward and needs must be carried forward through all future ages under the auspices and protection of Heaven An Alexander a Nero a Charles XII a Lewis XIV not to mention any more of the butchers and plunderers of the world would have felt themselves perfectly beatified in the thought  But the argument need not be extended God knows no artificial complex bodies such bodies can have no identity or responsibility in the ag∣gregate in another world A king will be judg∣ed not as a king but as a man his kingly acts were not appointed by God but his acts as a man are on the contrary the express appointment of God and are indispensable State necessity the  arcana imperii  or the accommodable municipal law of nations will not bring Kings off any more than a critical urgent train of circumstances into the embarrassment of which he has voluntarily brought himself will excuse an individual guilty of violence robbery or blood The law of nati∣ons and the secrets and policy of states are the institutions of mere men acting as their own law∣givers without precept or injunction from Heaven therefore can avail nothing as a justification in instances where a superior law has been broken and trodden under foot  This is clearly the state of things on the great Christian scale of required duty so that modern kings have but one alternative in the midst of their astonishing artificial greatness either to deny they are Christians throw off the appellative altogether or confess that the same simple pure unaffected disinterested morality in all cases whatsoever is as much required from them and those they depute in authority under them as from the very lowest of the people those they proudly call their sub∣jects and vassals Nor can a king with any pros∣pect of being heard retire to his closet to ask God forgiveness for his sins if he has by the medium of his fleets and armies shed the blood of one man or taken his property from him wrongfully not to mention the blood of thousands perhaps lying at his door whose ghosts are now soliciting resti∣tution from and vengeance upon him in the in∣visible world  Very true he cannot be called to account in this life except by another king haply as flagiti∣ous bloodyminded and inexorable as himself while in the mean time he is surrounded and kept in countenance by his generals and soldiers his courtiers and clergy What then These with himself shall in the natural course of things be reduced to that dust they now tread upon as in∣significant in memory as the monarchs and mini∣sters of state before the flood  A higher authority than any king's has said  Requite not evil but rather return evil for good  This is addressed to sovereigns as well as to beg∣gars nor have I the smallest doubt that should a king's duty as a Man and a Christian essentially interfere with his duty as a king or an elected head of a community that he should unquestion∣ly prefer the first to the last And should it even  come to that grand decisive declaratory point by which he must either cease to be king or wound his own conscience by disobeying God however importunate the fastidious and selfcreated exigen∣cies of a court might be that should impel him to act contrarily he ought undoubtedly to resign his sceptre and his crown for the same reason that a minister under him should give up his commission and emoluments annexed when any thing has been officially injoined him inconsistent with his ho∣nour virtue and integrityI believe not one in∣stance of the former has occurred in the annals of our world and of the latter comparatively very few But the paucity in either case establishes no precedent The superior exertions of disinter∣ested greatness and heroic excellence though sel∣dom very seldom occurring to ennoble our na∣ture are notwithstanding still within the requisiti∣ons of Christianity  The destruction of freedom in so many Chris∣tian kingdoms I may say in all except GreatBritain the natural birthright of men and in the defence of which taking the life of another is no crime by princes and kings is an accumulation of guilt upon  their head  which they may support for a few years by means of adventitious aids but which must assuredly overwhelm them when they stand common naked spirits in another world The extinction of Freedom is the extinction of e∣very noble manly generous virtue as well as Christian grace All tyrants therefore have this additional guilt lying heavy on their souls however insensible they are of it To deface the image of God in millions and from day to day prevent them from recovering it is an enormity of the first mag∣nitude but it wants a name Multitudes of ne∣farious execrable deeds in the primary move∣ments of every state according as it is more or  less tyrannical have no appropriate terms in our dictionaries They are too black and horrid and too industriously hid behind Tartarian veils from the inspection of the people to be admitted into the language of humanity But of all the deeds of darkness and insolent outrage on the privileges of mankind to destroy  the Liberty of the Press  is surely the most diabolical It is laying an embargo on the human mind saying to its di∣vine faculties  hitherto shall ye come and no farther  The same spirit were it competent to the act would lay an embargo on the sun and say to the heavenly brightener of our habitations hitherto shalt thou come proud luminary and here shall thy proud beams be staid Nay the very air we breathe in sweet and pure diffusion could the same spirit stop or confine its circulation it malig∣nantly would  The fact however is this What is just right and fit in England is just right and fit in France Germany Turky and in all the kingdoms of the earth Nations may be called great individuals under the eye of Nature's sovereign Lord subject to eternal laws superior to themselves which they may not on any pretence whatsoever relax ac∣commodate or explain away to serve their own partial local circumstances Were such a preeminent immutable law supposed not to exist let the intelligent reader mark the consequences E∣very nation must be considered as absolutely supreme and infallible in itself not with reference to man only but with reference to God the Creator of man This absurdity is too mighty to be swallow∣ed Another preposterous conclusion likewise fol∣lows The customs fashions peculiarities ca∣prices prejudices soil and climate of different countries would be ever varying the religion and virtue of each place so that men should have as  many standards independent on each other of virtue and religion as there are independent states whereby truth and moral rectitude should become a mere political engine a mere ministerial ma∣noeuvre of the state Such unavoidable conclusi∣ons need only be barely mentioned with the keenest effect of ridicule to flash men in the face  This blessed deduction however which ought to afford such comfort and not ignoble triumph to every British bosom would amply soothe the writer's trouble had he taken more to expose them Need he mention it Every grateful freeborn Briton will at the instant anticipate it in his thoughts It is this that wherever despotism dark sullen despotism slavery and oppression subsist now in Europe THERE  the liberty of the press  is destroyed absolutely annihilated A stigma of inef∣fable infamy on all tyrants had they time to be struck with it from the indulgence of their vices and sensualities they can only make men slaves by keeping them in impenetrable darkness and ig∣norance no remove from instinctive tameness and bestial stupidity As soon as ever men ascend a de∣gree above beasts of burden and brutes that feed on grass in happy light and knowledge they be∣gin to be conscious of selfdignity feel the long smothered fire of heaven the incitements of im∣mortality stir in their bosoms look upon their ty∣rant oppressors and taxmasters with indignant and disdainful eye dragging them to instant account as delinquents of the most capital atrociousness though pavilioned in all the terror and awfulness of majesty and empire  Prescient of what monsters kings would eventu∣ally turn out as free agents in the progress of time is it any wonder that God repeatedly refused a king to  his own people  the Jews and that when  he was importuned by Samuel to grant them one the gift was tacked with his  hot displeasure  and with the denunciation of endless woes and mise∣ries that unavoidably must accompany it The lan∣guage of Heaven is so strong declaratory point∣ed and irresistible that the writer in selfvindi∣cation cannot but transcribe it here  Now there∣fore  says God to Samuel  hearken unto their voice  the voice of the people  howbeit protest solemnly unto them the manner of the king that shall rule over them  THIS SHALL BE THE MANNER OF THE KING THAT SHALL RULE OVER THEM  He will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots and he will appoint him cap∣tains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to till his ground and to reap his har∣vests and to make his instruments of war and in∣struments of his chariots and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers and he will take your fields and your olive yards even the best of them and give them to his servants and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give them to his officers and to his servants and he will take the tenth of your men servants and your maid servants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work and he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants  AND YE SHALL CRY OUT IN THAT DAY BECAUSE OF THE KING WHICH YE SHALL HAVE CHOSEN AND THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN THAT DAY  Modern monarchy and tyranny wherever they are associated are here depicted to the life in∣deed so perfectly exact and literal that no mortal can mistake the prophetic description and fulfil∣ment Perhaps not one in a thousand has at∣tended  to this  assage significant and striking as it is and coming even from Almighty God himself for it cannot but be remarked  on account  of the multitudes of Cl  rgymen among us that take up∣on them the utterance of Inspiration to save man∣kind the trouble hat a thousand remarkable and important portions of the Word of God are as lit∣tle known among  s as little attended to as if they were really pas  ages of the Turkish Alcoran or the Empress of  ussia's new code of laws for her subjectsThis reproachful ignorance it is that renders us such willing submissive slaves to corrup∣tion and vice to arbitra  y kings and insolent states∣men  Britons upon the whole cannot but see the in∣dissoluble connection fa  beyond that of kings and subjects or even the ties of flesh and blood between  light knowledge  and the preservation of  freedom  and that the only means short of a mi∣racle of perpetuating ligh  and knowledge and diffusing them equally around is most religiously to preserve  the liberty of the press  from the rude impious check of kings and the contaminating breath of the servants of king    The liberty of the press  brought about the Re∣formation  the same Liberty of the Press  effected the thrice glorious Revolution and the transcend∣ent unspeakable blessings of both can alone be preserved and transmitted to a grateful posterity by  the liberty of the press  With respect to every advocate and stickler for restrictions on a  free press  he need only be asked in plain honest language would you be a  papist  Would you be a  slave  A wretch degraded from your rank in Creation to kiss the Pope's toe Or a wretch no less de∣graded from the same rank to drink without trial the tyrant's poisoned draught or stoop with∣out  asking a question to the bowstring of a Mute  There is no medium here  the p  ess  must be to∣tally free or not at all Whenever its freedom comes to be defined or circumscribed we must forthwith apply to my lord Chamberlain to know if God has permitted us to  feel  or not to  think  or not and to  express  our tho  ghts and feelings Britons will never condescend to this till they be∣come Italian monks or d  spicable Musselmen The noted Ovidian saying  n medio tutissimus ibis  is here a mean prosaical falsehood and holds a fal∣chion at the throat of Britih Liberty and British Independence  The halfconditioned friends of our constitution and those sagacious politic  ans that would  take in  our Liberties and Properties with half an eye will be ready to exclaim here What is not the Press be∣come the noted vehic  e of scandal slander and defamation is any thing sacred from its attempts even Kings Lords o  CommonsAll this is ac∣knowledged and that scandal slander and defa∣mation are evils that require speedy discounte∣nance and suppresson What then these and other evils inseparable from a  free press  if injuri∣ous to private character or property are all acti∣onable at common law and cognizable by a jury of peers Here then is an instant remedy for the disease but would you destroy the human body that is take away a man's life because that body is liable to infection and malady The sun has been and will be the  wicked  cause direct of many formidable natural evils would you deprive us of the sun The earth is often  guilty  of volcanos and earthquakes would you dispossess us of the earth to stand upon Even the air around us times without number has been highly  culpable  in af∣fording  a menstruum and vehicle to plague and pestilence by which millions of our species have been cut off would you rob us of the air the pure salubrious lifesustaining air And to have done with particulars many kings of Eng∣land have been tyrants persecutors and ruffians not behind the most savage in oppression and cru∣elty would you disinherit England of kings  the anointed of the Lord the breath of our nostrils  and thus leave the Lords and Commons to fight it out like the dogs in the fable pellmell harumscarum rantumscantum higgledypiggledy topsyturvy This last is addressed to primeministers an  ar∣gumentum ad hominem  Perhaps no degree of levity becomes the wri∣ter on so solemn and momentous an occasion he asks the reader's pardon therefore for the inde∣corumIndeed our times and the present critical situation of public affairs would seem objects that cannot be too seriously contemplated by the true lover of his country the good Protestant and the virtuous good man The whole force of the Em∣pire exerted and  more  than its own force to sub∣due  three millions  of people placed by Providence on an immense Continent three thousand miles off who only originally offended respecting the  mode  not the  matter  of taxation is an unparalleled aw∣ful period in English history and especially affect∣ing as the event is absolutely contingent and pre∣carious hid deep in the bosom of futurity though the probability of success would seem much against the  mother  country rising against her children the  old  and  infirm  against the  young  and  vigorous  The reflecting brow and pensive countenance should be characteristic of Britons at present however un∣accompanied by the example of our rulers who mean time are hyeing to farces pantomimes and  masquerades Only a tyrant a glutton and a savage played on his fiddle when Rome was in flames Papists have ceased to persecute and massacre Pro∣testants stung at last with compunction and re∣morse Protestants in the full possession of this longwished cardinal blessing fall out among them∣selves snatch up the weapons which papists had laid down and destroy and murder one another Let us hear no more of Popish cruelty and Popish de∣vastationsAdd to this A whole bench of  Pro∣testant bishops  in the senate either promoted or abetted this horrid this ruinous this accursed so∣cial war except one or two illustrious and divine spirits illustrious and divine in spite of their mitres while the whole  representative body  of the clergy pe∣titioned the King suspecting him to be naturally prone to justice and mercy to unsheath the sword of slaughter and plunge it in the bosoms of bre∣thren citizens and countrymen The scene is of a piece criminally aggravated portentous unpre∣cedented black and deformed throughout It is a national call upon GOD to behold a spectacle he hates and abhors one set of human beings butch∣ering and destroying another For what That the vanquished may adorn the triumphal entrance of Victory dragged at her chariot wheels or led through the streets in chains before her saturated eyeFor what To satiate the longings of re∣venge the cravings of corrupt avarice the unsuf∣ferable pride of power and the unextinguishable thirst of Empire and of human blood  In the foregoing strictures on Kings and any that may afterwards occur the writer would not be understood to involve the Monarch on the throne Whether the eventful and yet unknown operation of those vast armaments now fitted and gone out from Great Britain shall discover that  his servants have acted wisely and faithfully to∣wards  him  or grossly deceived and abused  his  con∣fidence God only knows and a messenger from God can only tell The world thinks differently on this vast and interesting subject The writer's sentiments may be collected from this Preface and what follows Whatever they may be termed he cannot suppress them without wounding his in∣ward convictions and laying an embargo on his mind for doing which as a Freeman and a Pro∣testant Kings or ministers of state might reward him were he of consequence enough but could not recompense him  The diseases of a state like many of those that attack the human constitution are almost always chronical that is run through an indeterminate period not within the political physician's calcula∣tion before they end fatally nevertheless are as sure in their progress as they are slow While such numbers are daily permitted in the newspapers even by  patent royal  to deliver their thoughts of all disorders incident to our species on which im∣mediately depend the lives of his majesty's liege subjects and to prescribe their nostrums according∣ly surely individuals may with the utmost license step forward on the theatre of public notice to re∣mark on the consumptive habit and decline of the  body politic  on which depend the liberty and pro∣perty of his majesty's liege subjects and propose without fee or reward that regimen and those palliatives which have been found most useful to such a constitution the chief of which are these A perfect conquest of the  royal  passionsa total re∣linquishment of extraordinary  royal  cares and world∣ly acquisitionspeace and tranquillity of the  royal  mindtemperance patience resignation and con∣tentment with regard to the grand vicissitudes of  the world under the direction of Providence and superior to the councils of KingsAuthors writing on such a subject have a plea in their favour be∣yond medical speculatists and all patenteedoctors a plea really amounting to  selfpreservation  since writing on the diseases of the body politic they un∣doubtedly write on their  own diseases  being mem∣bers of the body politic which every man has an indisputable right to do even independent of  royal patent  as a denizen of a popular state The mat∣ter rests here and here would rest the writer's apo∣logy for the boldness and unreservedness of his re∣marks seeing the same sacred voluntary right that placed GEORGE III and continues him on the throne of England in preference of an arbitrary Romancatholic discarded prince privileges the  present  writer and  every  writer of the British Em∣pire to deliver his opinions freely of public measures and public exigencies Nor can this Preface be concluded in a more suitable manner than by most fervently wishing GEORGE III the appointed and recognized first magistrate of these realms far more than the tumultuous crowded re∣flections of fluctuating empirewishing him the present and the future consolations of a just and ho∣nest man the only character GOD attends to connected with his being the tenderhearted and af∣fectionate father of his people independent of all selfishness and jealousy about the defence or exten∣sion of  mere personal prerogative  hitherto unde∣fined and to all eternity undefinable except by the peopleTo have done  The  Sequel to Common Sense  is an adventurous and unceremonious production like its forerunner but I hope is calculated to give Britons and Irish∣men an  idea  and  feeling  of liberty which as to the writer it appears very few of them have had  before at least if they really have it they  act  especially our representatives in Parliament the delegates of the people as if they had it not which is infinitely worse than brutish insensibility Li∣berty civil and religious is the sum of human good and the ever present object of every man's ambition who has not been previously acted upon and stupified deprived of all principle manhood virtue dignity and spirit by the deadening squeeze of  Corruption's  torpedinous handWe seem to have lost all duty to God our  Maker Governour  and  Judge  all consideration of his Most Excellent Majesty in our preposterous shameful senseless impious  idolatry  of Kings and the vicegerents of Kings expending on the dust and rags of morta∣lity called  royal  and  imperial  those high epithets those superlatively august titles Most Dread Sove∣reign Most Sacred Majesty Most Excellent Ma∣jesty c c which alone belong to the God of Heaven and the Lord of universal nature On this account though little attended to  God is a jea∣lous God  added to our vicious morals and the uni∣versal profligacy of our manners while we are mocking God in Cathedrals Churches and Cha∣pels with the conceit mummery and flippery of worship some awful revolutional punishment if not speedily deprecated and warded off certainly awaits our nation  A SEQUEL TO COMMON SENSE c  NOTWITHSTANDING what has been writ∣ten by the inquisitive the ingenious the learned and the industrious on American affairs and that most people think the subject exhausted to me it appears I have no vanity on the occasion there are  two considerations  hitherto untouched that tend to throw a decisive air on the whole that is if we take our rule of judgment from first principles original rights and general rectitude confirmed and illustrated by that excellent mora∣lity delivered to us in Revelation and not from the narrowed corporational maxims of a particular state or kingdom even with admired and idolized  patriotism  on ourside which must always give place to humanity and reverence for Heaven Nor do I think it would reflect any discredit on the great∣est monarch or greatest statesman to be instructed in his duty from Heaven less than the meanest private individual but surely it realizes a disgrace on modern times not to be gilded over or conceal∣ed that the grand movements of government are now conducted on the same confined partial mer∣cenary despotic unjust cruel scale that was the standard of Pagan times and Heathenish manners nay I will be bold to affirm on a worse scale in many particulars Our European kings are now called Christian and many of them have pompous Christian epithets appended to their armorial titles Is there any idea annexed to the term Christian  Or is it a mere convenient designation of popular honour to flourish at a marketcross in the mouth of an herald or king at arms Our MOST CHRIS∣TIAN KINGS are as little Christian except in the rareeshow of public worship bordering upon ido∣latry and romance imposed upon them by fellow mortals as any that reigned a thousand years be∣fore Christ From such premises we must not draw our conclusions from such models we must not finish our copies There is a standard beyond the etiquette of a court the records of Parliament or the secreted schedules of a Cabinet Council that will always determine the true philosophical politi∣cian or political philosopher By this standard the standard of humanity inforced by Christian ethics the following pages must be judged as indeed it is confessed they cannot abide any other I have no object but the establishment and elucidation of truth as leaning on general primary axioms not on mere territorial authority and Machiavelian usage I have no lucrative expecta∣tions from any person in power nor would I ac∣cept of remuneration from any government upon earth in the light of a hireling pensioned writer I am in a professionary situation to  live  What can a monarch or his prime minister say more Let my judges be the species at large let me have an appeal to Heaven and let Lord North try me when he pleases  While something more tremendously definitive than speculation is now carrying on between the principals in the grand contest the sons of leisure and literature may be indulged in the exercise of the pen unsupported and unsanctified by which the sword even supposing a Caesar or an Alexan∣der to wield it had better have reposed in its scab∣bard covered with rust and edgeless from disuse  The longest and strongest sword may precipitate all things before it in this world But what is this world in comparison with existence to come No more than a hillock of ants in the front of a sul∣tan's palace or in the midst of his gardens de∣stroying one another did ants destroy one another like men The sword forms no defence in a fu∣ture world nor is it admitted as evidence Even upon earth a man with a sword in his hand would not be suffered to approach a bar of justice or as∣size No he must there appear disarmed if any person can be said to be disarmed who trusts his cause to judicial trial on the manly principles of right reason and convincing argument But not to lose sight of the two considerations we set out with let them be mentionedThey are these  First Parliaments cannot be supreme in all cases whatsoever without being infallible also Se∣condly Colonies when they find themselves able that is  come of age  may in consequence of an una∣nimity nay a majority of voices throw off all sub∣jection to the originating parent Sate a power de∣rived from God and authorized by the necessity of things To suppose the negative of either of these would be to suppose contradictions admissi∣bleOf these in their order  Till it is impossible for Parliaments to err to be tyrannical to be cruel and unjust the absolute su∣premacy of Parliament is  vox et preterea nihil  A word indeed of infinite sonorous energy in the mouth of him whose highest ambition looks but upward to a place or who wishes to preserve the place he has already got But witnesses of this kind are to be accounted partial and subornedSince then it is possible for Parliaments to err all histo∣rical evidence proves it it follows of course that a power to detect that error exists somewhere in  the aggregate body Otherwise one error how fatal soever esteemed would beget another and yet another until the constitution should actually fall by the hands of its own guardians and protec∣tors But who is to judge of the emergency The party aggrieved doubtless Supposing how∣ever  that  party inconsiderable What is to be done Why it must submit merely from necessity and the duty of selfpreservation but with an abiding consciousness of having been deeply in∣jured connected with the consolation of a future appeal where arbitrary inforcement and superior numbers avail nothing unless it be to give aggra∣vation to offence and crimson to guilt Farther admitting the party aggrieved nearly on a par with the highhanded insolent aggressors in such a case all the laws of God and man authorize a spirit of defence resistance repulse and reprisal If un∣successful in the attempt the want of success by no means tends to infer delinquency rather indeed the contrary in most cases as people unworthily disposed always wish to carry by numbers and dra∣gooning violence what they are well aware the jus∣tice and integrity of their cause could never effec∣tuate  This latent unrepressible spirit pervading the se∣veral parts of a mighty empire is in truth its ba∣sis and security For did not the governing pow∣ers decree and act under the intimidation and eventual interference of a  greater  power  in diffuso  every state would become despotic and every Prince a tyrant The very freedom of a state is a standing recognition a tacit acknowledgment of a mightier power than the governing and the legi∣slative existing in the body of the people In this sense the common adage  vox populi vox Dei  has both significance and propriety  According to this representation it is plain that only despotic governments can in any appro∣priate sense be called supreme or infallible that is to say irreprehensible and uncontroulable by any cotemporary power upon earth for could their legislation be reprehended and controuled they should not any longer be despotic but freeTo draw matters to a point  Great Britain is a free popular state This is acknowledged on all hands and remains an in∣stance of her consummate wisdom persevering virtue and heroism truly respectable and venera∣ble Her freedom and popularity then amidst surrounding arbitrary nations serve as an illustri∣ous and irrefragable proof that her legislation may be disputed and her executive powers resisted in many possible cases When they happen every member of the empire not to mention great pro∣vincial divisions of it has an undoubted right to judge for himself If inadequate to the momen∣tous risque of resistance to do himself justice af∣ter every intermediate moderate step has been ta∣ken in vain he has a clear right to annihilate his connections with such a state and commence a freeman in any latitude or upon any shore more kindly to his prospects and more congenial with his sentiments God the supreme king and go∣vernor of all nations to whom monarchs are as subject as slaves invests him with this paramount privilege from the same principle of benignity and fitness he has planted the strong sense of selfpreservation in his breast to avoid the tyger and the lion when he finds himself unable to subdue eitherTo throw one's self in the way of a lion or a tyger when a method of escape presents it∣self would not be gallantry or spirit but foolhar∣diness and  bedlamiteism  It is granted people may often imagine them∣selves aggrieved with little or no reason and that it is an heinous offence to disturb the peace and tranquility of a state but then the possibility of the reverse becoming a necessitous duty lays a foundation of contingent resistance even in the most correct and guarded theory I shall beg leave to give an exemplification in point Suppose Par∣liament should conceive the idea and put it into operation of depriving a particular county of its two representatives yet nevertheless continue to levy taxes and all public burdens upon its inhabi∣tants would not such a county have sufficient cause to think itself most injuriously treated and conse∣quentially authorized to run thro' all the mediums petitional of retributory redress even undismayed by the last resort insurgency against its oppressors though no less high in official department than high in the flagitiousness of offence And if una∣ble with any probable views of success to carry matters in this way would not the inhabitants of such a county merit the highest elogiums due to spirit and magnanimity should they nobly take the resolution of removing their effects and emi∣grating beyond seas to a more hospitable and righ∣teous clime the seat of common right and inde∣pendenceGod in the first instance is the giver of property and the great protector of property to whom there lies an appeal from all mankind how great soever when it is unjustly and violently invaded and to whom we must be circumstantially accountable for its use and abuse its embezzlement and preservation as property aptly secured and judiciously laid out is effective of excellent ends and purposes in this world Persons that have an im∣portant trust or deposit in their hands if from in∣dolence carelessness want of spirit or want of  fortitude they suffer it to fall a prey to wicked men private pilferers or open robbers however at first these wicked men varnished over their in∣tentions with plausibility such persons are betray∣ers of their trust unworthy of generous confidence and chargeable with the worst of crimes at the bar of justice and equity All our possessions we hold from God in trust it cannot be ours absolutely and indefinitively because that same power whose gift or transfer the possession is disposes likewise of the possessor's life either sooner or later there∣fore to suffer property to be lessened or taken away without our assent and concurrence is dis∣loyalty and unfaithfulness to God Duty to kings magistrates or agents of  our own  selection and re∣cognition cannot supercede or set  these  aside  Something of the same nature with the foregoing was actually seen to happen not long ago in Ire∣land respecting not a county alone but a whole province the province of Ulster The Dissenters making by far the most considerable body in that province without being either represented or having personal votes in vestries were made sub∣ject to be taxed by act of parliament for the re∣pairs and ornaments of churches places of worship against their consciences at the discretion of peo∣ple too much disposed to hold them in durance and contempt It is true an act so arbitrary un∣generous and unmanly was no proof of the spi∣rit of the times It originated with a single per∣son a great ecclesiastic ecclesiastics have always been at the bottom of slavery and oppression and was suffered to pass somewhat unaccountably through the negligence of some and the supine inattention of others in which circumstances most dark and wicked schemes are pushed into form  The Dissenters to a man were irritated and alarmed being conscious of no defaulture They had several meetings and consultations touching the necessity of declaring their united sentiments on so critical an occasion and at length unani∣mously agreed to petition Parliament They did so from their respective parish districts in a de∣cent dispassionate but able manner The prayer of their petitions was heard by a sensible libe∣ralminded majority in the House of Commons the obnoxious act repealed and peace and security restored to a vast body of opulent wellaffected people who otherwise might have been preci∣pitated into that species of illhumour and discon∣tent which every wise government will always ap∣pease and soothe in the first instance where a use∣ful and numerous set of men are concerned  Indeed it cannot but be observed here that the procedure of the governing powers with reference to the VestryAct contradicted their general line of conduct in American affairs The VestryAct and the right of internally taxing the Colonies proceeded on the same principle The ostensible cause of the one was the delinquency of a riotous mob in the town of Boston of the other a refrac∣tory disposition shewn by a few dissenting congrega∣tions with regard to the repair of churches In both cases how inadequate the  cause  to the  effect  how disproportionate the  punishment  to the  offence  When the  Hearts of Steel  committed such disturb∣ances in two or three Northern counties had Go∣vernment sent fleets and armies to punish Ireland by the demolition of her towns and the destructi∣on of her inhabitants what brasscomplexioned courtier would have held up his face to justify the deed The instances are exactly parallel I cannot possibly look upon them in any other light For the  same reason that America is  now  surrounded with predatory fleets and invasive armies and the taxa∣tion law against the Dissenters was enacted the trade of Ireland should now be destroyed her ma∣ritime towns thrown into conflagration and her children slaughtered by an unpitying soldiery on account of the acts of insurgency and violence com∣mitted by the  SteelBoys  Politicians may refine away the similarity as politicians have before now refined away private judgment and the liberty of the subject into inde∣feasible right nonresistance and church authori∣ty but all such refinements are only those of Sa∣tan to establish his kingdom upon earth On the ground of general humanity the law of nations jurisprudential rectitude and political integrity subject to a test paramount to them all the Divine Law for sure we call ourselves Christians I in∣vite any one to prove that the above cited cases are not perfectly in point and his arguments shall have fair play Should such a person object to the invitation being anonymous let him make his best efforts on the subject and the writer hereof promises to step forward in reply with his name at full length to his book not begrudging him the full advantage of all that the learned doctors Johnson and Shebbeare have declaimed on the same side with himself  It is true the Americans stand itemed  Rebels  in the Parliament records and in the K's speech∣es but with the most dutiful respect for the S and veneration for the Council of the nation I do aver it that no K or Parliament upon earth has authority to fix the meaning of language for me or alter the nature of things by a particular arbitrary use of terms Many great and good men about the K and in parlia∣ment  reprobated the term and protested against the application of it Are no men honest but such as are paid for being dishonest I mean those in lucrative places and on the pension list not to mention the unmarshalled tribe standing on the tip∣toe of court expectationI may take  my  license of speech and nickname  those  rebels and traitors to the then crowned and sceptred monarch that brought WILLIAM into England and afterwards set him upon the throne in consequence of which GEORGE now inhabits a royal palace and reigns over a mighty would to God they were a united people Will their lordships B N M S G H  c c  give me credit for  my  term if not why should I a free member of the British empire though not in any place at court give them credit for  theirs  Language is common to the species and cannot be monopolized or unalterably fixt till our legs and necks shall be first fitted to the yoke and the fetters In such a case language would be of no use to us more than to the ox or the ass for were we to upbraid our tyrants it would only be to have our tongues cut out of our heads lest in the aggrievement and indignation of our spirits we should spit upon them nextThis matter may require a farther discussion the discussion of Common Sense and common honesty  What government led at the discretion of lords North Mansfield and company now calls rebel∣lion should be styled by the same legislative au∣thority directed by a Chatham or a Camden a necessary laudable spirit of resistance that identical spirit which seated GEORGE III on the throne of the British empire and excluded for ever the lineal heir of these realms Are the former noble lords endued with infallibility in their interpretation  of words beyond the latter Who that thinks or reads beyond a Primmer other than a pensioner or the hungry expectant of a pension will take up∣on him to assert this Oh will it be replied by our legal vociferators of rebellion that the latter noble lords are  out  of place and would stretch eve∣ry nerve to get  in  hence their abhorrence of what they affect to call our present court idioms and  juntonian  phraseology Even allowing this its ut∣most validity which I would never allow but for argument's sake still it amounts to a presumption only a bare begging of the question The now vernacular usage of speech crying out rebellion rebellion within the environs of St James's rests upon the proof of the same arbitrary disin∣genuous timeserving kind  actually positive  The ministerial exclaimers of rebellion have all in sub∣stantial possession places pensions douceurs gra∣tuities almost beyond arithmetic the above therefore is one of these unfortunate proofs that have two edges the one obtuse and harmless the other keen and cutting Those assailants that use it fondly imagining they are doing wondrous ex∣ecution and dealing wounds and death around them never advert to the circumstance of their having mistaken the side deeply wounding and mangling themselves without once piercing even the scarfskin of those they assailMy lords Chat∣ham and Camden positively will not call the Ame∣ricans rebels because they  want  places at court my lords North and Mansfield reiterate the odious appellation and paste it in capitals on the back of the Americans because they  have  places  ergo  a negative must take place of an affirmative or else the former Right Hon Peers have  indeed  adhered to the chasteness purity dignity and manliness of language The court and its dependants using  the abominable hueandcry terms  rebels traitors  in doubtful cases and by no means universally ac∣knowledged is the same thing as two persons met on the ground in single combat and the one call∣ing the other a rascal and a scoundrel What lord in Administration so critically stationed would call his antagonist a rascal or a scoundrel Should any lord act so unlike himself before he discharged his pistol or made his lounge he would deserve to be treated with silent but manly contempt or to be horsewhipt by his adversary's coachman ra∣ther than indulged with the honourable event of a duelIt may be argued that the constitution must be preserved at any rate and whatever the expence of blood and treasure its preservation may require if we would exist as a nation or people at all Agreed but the true way of preserving the con∣stitution is to know precisely the diseases it is lia∣ble to and when they happen to apply the pro∣per remedies otherwise political death must ensue of course as natural death when the human body labours under a disorder for which there is no cure Moreover the Americans are the people at present that are preserving the constitution by defending  the principle  on which it is founded the right of assent and consent in taxation either per∣sonal or substitutional without which no state can subsist free but soon sink into abject slavery even through the medium of its own taxational largesses  Supremacy of Parliament  on the one hand and  un∣conditional submission  on the other are the dogmas and language of Turks not of Britons God himself requires not unconditional submission from his creatures but submission on the clearest moral evidence and internal conviction GIII and his highpriests Nh Msd Gmne we suppose are Beings of superior order to their MAKER  In short it would not be our Country or the general interests of the species we should assist by taking our construction of words from the noble lords North and Mansfield even with the erudite lexicographical critic Dr  Johnson  at their elbow in preference of the still nobler lords Chatham and Camden but the prime minister for the time being and his satellitary circle Had lord Chatham or lord Camden directed the helm of affairs for some time past the inglorious and destructive emergency which now serves as an apology for offi∣cial despotism and ministerial depredation to the honour of our species and the glory of Britain would not have marked the historical page of the times with civil blood nor sent abroad through the land among kinsmen citizens and neighbours the horrid the infernal cry of  murder  The plain English therefore of the whole is this A senatorial majority let them tell from what en∣nobled disinterested selfdenied principle  feel  themselves pertinaciously disposed to support the lords Mansfield and North in preference of the lords Chatham and Camden Is this the amount of Parliamentary integrity Parliamentary public spirit Parliamentary affection for GEORGE III and the Protestant succession Or shall a Murray or a North in point of preeminent rectitude of intention solidity of honest talents and celebrity of fame stand unblushing competitors with a PITT or a PRATTThe  latter  last war reduced the haughty Spaniard and the Gaul to the humility of soliciting peace at the footstool of GEORGE III and spread the conquering names of BRITONS to the farthest parts of the earth Let us be told what the  former  have done to excite admiration and gratitude if we except their superlative merit in plunging us into all the complicated horrors and  miseries of civil war a war among kinsmen bre∣thren and friendsCompare them together Nay rather let every freeborn Briton lay his hand on his untutored heart and generously exculpate the Americans who have as true a right to pro∣perty from God as the Premier or his master in their CONGRESSIONAL resistance to a tyran∣nical rapacious vindictive Minister who is now convulsing a mighty and hitherto a glorious em∣pire in order to glut a herd of needy dependants with rapine and plunder the rapine of virtuous citizens and the plunder of genuine Protest∣ants  A private writer taking so much upon him with such freedom and boldness will no doubt be severely censured by those who are accustomed to think differently on the subject perhaps find their account in so doing It may be sufficient in reply to this to observe that many writers on the con∣trary side have written at least with equal bold∣ness and freedom with a strain of acrimonious dogmatism and abusive inflation of language su∣peradded not to be imitated by writers that have no partial views or private inducementsnot to be imitated by the present writer To speak in the first person of allowable egotism though a private and an anonymous writer I am a denizen of the British empire not to mention a higher title still a denizen of GOD's universal empire the world I support in my place and variously circumstanced the exigencies of the state help to pay the army and navy those brave fellows that hitherto have been prodigal of their blood in the defence of Liberty pure and uncorrupted from court pollu∣tion Nay to ascend in my importance I help to maintain GEORGE III to feed him to clothe him and incircle his person with majesty by con∣tributing  to pay the public taxes What were GEORGE III king of England without his thousands and his ten thousands  like me  to pay their quotas into the national treasuryTrue what I pay is but a mite compared with the pro∣portions of others but a levied  mite  had once an high compliment paid it and by a good judge I also gratefully acknowledge that I have full va∣lue received in present protection and freedom for every tax I pay even to the light that shines through my window and the fire that burns on my hearth What thenthis very circumstance creates an anxiety not to be repressed looking for∣ward to the preservation and continuance of this protection and freedom without which the  present  possession would be little beyond a purse of gold in our pockets on Hounslowheath This gives me also and sanctifies my right to speak freely of pub∣lic measures in which I am as truly concerned as any Prime Minister of the land If the British empire be lost leaning on its first principle virtu∣ous equal liberty I lose my all In the imme∣diate or even the remote prospect of this shall I hold my tongue because I have not a paltry pen∣sion or ministerial bribe for speakingMy right to speak and write so far as I refrain from injuring private characters and private property which I shall ever do is beyond that of a member of Par∣liament or privy counsellor By that original and divine authority which makes all kings members of Parliament and privy counsellors I write and were it not for this transcendant and unalienable right lodged with Man by the great Creator of heaven and earth kings members of Parliament and privy counsellors instead of applying annual∣ly to the People for the very breath of their nos∣trils the very meat they eat and the cloaths they  wear would in the persons of bailiffs and consta∣bles enter ourmore than royal palacesour vir∣tuous habitations empty our coffers into their pockets the fruit of our honest industry and perhaps in an act of uniform familiarity ravish our wives and debauch our daughtersThere is a time for national rest and constitutional slumbers but there is likewise a time would to God it were not what  now  throws shadows on our dials for the thunderclothed vehemence of the mouth and the lightningkindled enthusiasm of the pen The cannon even under the match of a Briton can∣not silence the one nor the sword even wielded by a Briton cannot outflash the otherLong eternally long may the experiment remain to be tried and Britain  almost imperceptibl  in the internal poise of its three equipolent estates be like the earth with nothing material or visible to support it yet balanced unmoveably on its own axis  From the above induction of particulars it would appear that the supremacy of Parliament is in fact nothing else in our corrupt degenerate day than the supremacy of the Prime minister whose supremacy can be no farther absolute than that of the enthroned Roman Pontiff and  his  no more re∣spectable than the sweat and filth of his toe howe∣ver extended for adosculationThere are many things Parliament cannot do with all its height of pretension and magnificence of claim It  cannot  set aside the verdict of a Jury in a criminal cause It  cannot  interfere in the business of elections for its own members otherwise than by its Speaker issuing writs It  cannot  take away from the King the power of a negative on all its legislative acts It  cannot  impose taxes of interior operation where there is no deliberative assent of the people either  personally or representatively present Nor to mention no more instances can it prolong itself beyond its octennnial term of existence With all these marks of impotence and nonefficiency on its forehead to hear of Parliamentary supre∣macy i e omnipotence and infallibility they are convertible ideas forces one however unwilling to picture to himself a snail carrying its little shell about with it but assuring the  limacious circle  a∣round that it is indeed an elephant with a cohort of soldiers on its back or an ephemeron stepping into existence today and out of it tomorrow but at the same time declaring itself immortalAll these acts of parliamentary impotence just now spe∣cified are however resistless acts of spontaneity in the people at large whenever they are struck with the expedience and necessity of interposing i e whenever court measures and ministerial e∣dicts have a direct instant tendency to issue in their slavery At such an awful critical period God the Monarch paramount of the world calls upon the people to do their posterity right by e∣mancipating themselves from those bolts and fetters they were neuer created forGodunder whom the greatest emperor that wears a diadem is no more than a viceroy or governor of a province under an earthly king and both no more when compared with the majesty and almightiness of the sebjects at large than a mastersheep at the head of the flock with a bell about his neckSuch a renunciation of tyrannical masters the elastic re∣covery of a people to the original poise of their own rights were such a sentimental exertion of duty to God the alone supreme king of all the earth as the Jews would have exhibited when they got a king from Heaven  in wrath  had they thrown themselves upon the clemency and provi∣dence  of God by once more recognizing him as their  alone  king and governor Hear their own ap∣propriate language to Samuel  Pray for thy ser∣vants unto  Lord thy God  they durst not call him  our God that we die not for we have added unto our sins  THIS EVIL  to ask a king  The peo∣ple being thrown into disorder and confusion in consequence of this reassumption of original rights is no objection to the effort against voluntary slave∣ry as nothing can be pure that owes its existence to art without a previous fermentation and as no future system can become perfect and perma∣nent without the experience of former systems having been imperfect and precarious Beside men would always wish to suffer  with hope  if suf∣fer they must rather than to suffer without it there is no hope however in slavery but  death  Let it be understood here to blunt the edge of outrageous remark that the writer would not insinuate the lawfulness or expediency of an effort in the people till the last extreme the impassable and unsurmountable extreme shall call them forth like a voice from Heaven to the field  The People alone therefore not kings or par∣liaments can with any decency challenge the high prerogative of being supreme that is ultimately decisive and unresponsible Kings and parliaments are in the last instance responsible to those that made themthe People Who made the People God  Nihil vero verius  Kings and Parlia∣ments otherwise would be of no use to the People but rather a curse and a scourge It is owing en∣tirely to their being controulable and accountable in the dernier resort that freemen could derive a∣ny advantage from their rulers and governors for unquestionably no body of men would be so stupid and senseless as to chuse a ruler or governor  to deteriorate their condition or render their right to or possession of property  more  ambiguous and periclitated than in a state of nature The soci∣al compact and the complicated form of govern∣ment grounded upon it commenced for the great∣er security of life personal freedom and proper∣ty but if in such a situation they become  less  se∣cure then is the state of Nature preferable to that of society and governmentTo descend from ge∣neral to local views from great to little objects  The Rev JOHN WESLEY'S arguments and those of all writers on his side wrought in JOHNSONIAN tissue as they are must pass for nought till the a∣bove leading data are disproved Picking straws off the surface will never gratify genuine ambition while inestimable beds of pearl below deride our want of courage or want of apparatus to dive for it Political expedience connected with a particu∣lar system chiefly lucrative to men officially em∣ployed and general rectitude involving the com∣mon concerns of mankind and referable to God as the supreme arbiter and judge are two distinct things nor was it becoming a Christian divine he would be thought so to ground his deducti∣ons on the former and not on the latter  His  deductions indeed they cannot be called The Rev  John Wesley  is a plagiary without being ho∣nest enough to apologize for it Dr  Johnson  not only furnished him with his reasonings if such they may be called but his language also True we are told  The Critical Reviewers would screen him most shamefully by alledging he could not find better thoughts or expressions an excuse for all literary theft even did a new set of Review∣ers arise pilfer the Critical and vend their monthly labours as their own  he could not adopt better on the side he  took but shall a man counterfeit the current coin of a kingdom from the circumstance of his not having more valuable models to take his impressi∣ons from Nor was it a seemly excuse for robbing a great and growing people of their rights and franchises that he had before robbed a celebrated author of his writingsOur second Consi∣deration remains to be brought before the reader  It may not be improper to mention here the outlines of two Gentlemen's opinions that have figured but widely differed in the dispute between  England  and  America  I mean EDMOND BURKE  Esq  and Dr TUCKER  Dean of Gloucester  Not∣withstanding the  latter  affects to despise the explosive effects of the  former  's rhetorical thunder and lightning the most cursory reader cannot but remark that the  Rev Dean  found himself violently scorched by the one and sonorously roused to wound∣ed selfconsequence by the other He expresses great deference for the House of Commons and  modestly  hints his regret in en∣tering on a question then before that House but respecting Mr Burke a member thereof he professedly loosens himself from all ceremony and indeed would notably reduce him to a mere senatorial mummy of splendid diction simile and meta∣phor Where is the Dean's decorum or consistency here It is not the House that covers the members but the members that constitute the House that ought to be considered in connection with the Dean's idea of augustness For the same reason that the House of Commons is intitled to deference and respect Mr Burke is whether in or out of the House In either case his identity is the same and as he is confessedly one of the most su∣perior speakers there both with regard to the weight of argu∣mentative ability and masterly display of elocution he certain∣ly comprises in his single person a degree of augustness and preeminence beyond the  one half  of that assembly made up of mere monosyllabic  yeas  and  noes  who if they have capacity  cannot discover it  and if they have knowledge  cannot communi∣cate it  The learned Dean therefore while he pays his tri∣bute to the House of Commons and at the same time would withhold it from Mr Burke undoes with his  right  hand what he had endeavoured to do with his  left  This must either be the amount of our Dean's attempt or he must be understood to mean that the stone and mortar of the House of Commons and the benches on which the members sit actually constitute  the house  Waving however the point of contrariety between the House and Mr Burke to me it appears no breach of deference or respect for the augustness of the  representative body  in Parliament as∣sembled to take up and canvas any subject though instantly in deliberation before that body The Clergy are always exces∣sively complaisant and well bred The same right that autho∣rises us to send representatives to Parliament authorizes us to  think speak  and  write  even antecedent to the decisions of that assembly Every member of a free state sits in a greater than any Parliament House in the area of Humanity a theatre only bounded by the poles where he sits and deliberates in right of a summons from the great CREATOR instead of a writ issued by the Speaker of a popular local assembly Re∣spect and deference in durance to the  latter  and not to the  for∣mer  in their consequential stages of advance always arrive at that obsequiousness and submission which the despot cannot but contemplate with satisfaction and the vain empty man ever accepts of with avidity  With regard to a plan of Colonistic accommodation the point agitated between these two Gentlemen singularly important and interesting as its consequences would seem it can never be brought to any issue so as to carry conviction to either of their bosoms they proceed on different data and opposite princi∣ples The Great Senator maintains that the Colonies are  not  in rebellion but urged to selfdefence and irritated to hostile repulsion by arbitrary exaction and highhanded assessments On this ground the excellent speaker has held forth a plan of accommodation judicious solid pertinent and salutary alike becoming  freemen  to offer and  freemen  to accept The learned Dean on the contrary falls in with the minister's majority in Parliament and considers the Americans as  rebels  flying in the face of the parent state and aiming at a  traitorous  independence hence have subjected themselves to all that parliamentary indig∣nation and resentment which have been avowed and put into executive force against them The Rev Dean has quite forgot here that no one is a  rebel  till he has been proved such on trial before his peers and at common law and that to nickname and punish a man as a  rebel  or  traitor  prior to his being tried and found guilty is the same thing as to punish an individual as a robber or murderer before he has been proved such A royal proclamation can neither  make  nor  set aside  law except in France or Turkey if it supercedes trial at bar or by jury it supercedes courts of justice and renders Parliaments useless In short the Dean's reasonings and conclusions in general and to say the utmost of them rest upon one pillar onlythe supre∣macy and omnipotence of Parliament if the substruction can be removed the superstructure falls of course Nothing can be supreme or omnipotent without being infallible also Till Parliaments become absolutely infallible I believe it will not happen in our day Parliaments areunomnipotent and unsu∣preme To say that Parliament is supreme and omnipotent in all cases whatsoever is saying that Lord North or the ostensi∣ble minister for the time being is supreme and omnipotent in all cases whatsoever While the minister holds the national bag as Judas did his Master's he turns Parliaments at pleasure as the winds turn the weathercock but not alas with the same innocence and want of consciousnessIt is no less notorious than the false grandeur gaming dissipation and shameful luxury of the times that  placemen pensioners  and  military servants  al∣ways make up the determining majority in both Houses a packed disqualified unconstitutional junto not excepting the Right Rev Bench Can such be called competent equitable judges any more than jurymen or witnesses in trials of life and death and property who have been bribed and subornedThe ana∣logy is pointed and decisive and evinces with what matureness of judgment as well as superiority of talents the  oratorial light  of the British senate revolved his subject But alas the aera the honourable and inestimable aera of  accommodation  is now over in despite of a CHATHAM and a BURKE whose rea∣sonings one would have thought were sufficient to illuminate a world instead of three insular spots the Americans have de∣clared themselves INDEPENDENT while our egregious rulers sitting on their hobbyhorse of supremacy and omnipotence have the sweets of a sugar plumb to roll in their mouths for losing one half division of a great empire hitherto in conjunc∣tion with AMERICA the arbitress of Europe and empress of the seas    COLONIZATION is the voluntary deliberate act of a few leaving the parent country to begin an adopted one in a distant region under the in∣stant disadvantages of an unknown situation inha∣bited  by hostile natives paucity exposure want of order and want of form The parent country is no less naturally induced to protect cherish and  fondle this infant colony than parents of another kind to protect cherish and fondle their puling offspring nor would a dereliction of duty and kind affections in the one case be a greater crime than in that of the other As our children run through the progressive stages of infancy childhood youth manhood  c  and demand attentions from their parents applicable and appropriate to each stage so do colonies from their first settlement to their ripe∣ning into internal subordination and Empire and are certainly intitled to attentions of a similar na∣ture from the mother state But by the police of all well constituted kingdoms a certain time ar∣rives which we are accustomed to call the age of adultness when nonage ceases when children be∣come independent of parents and privileged to commence in their own persons possessors of pro∣perty under no parental limitation or controul In a correspondent way Colonies by the perseve∣ring exercise of virtue and industry the meliorati∣on of their lands and the extension of their com∣merce added to the capital circumstance of a prodigious still increasing population are autho∣rized by the law of Nature and Providence the only original binding moral law to stand on their own legs and to do for themselves unconnected feudally or legislatively with the parent State In their political nonage indisputably they felt and grew beneath the protecting hand of the parent who in return for protection and by way of entire indemnification beheld a concentration of the chil∣dren's commercial goods and property annually pouring into her coffers but shall this monopoly be still insisted on and inforced this stated requital for favours received when the favours are no long∣er needed or required Real children under age owe passive obedience to parents as a return for  support and maintenance but come of age passive obedience ceases of course with the support and maintenance being no longer requisite In both cases the necessity of the thing ought to strike us with the full force and energy of truth  Did not children at a certain time become inde∣pendent of their parents with regard to free agen∣cy and moral accountableness there would happen in an indefinite number of instances such an accu∣mulation of domestic government as would soon grow to be loaded with all the miseries and abomi∣nations of the feudal system perfectly oppressive and unsufferable even to the destruction of nati∣onal police and socialcompact A father might live to be a greatgrandfather and under his absolute dominion in one house at the same time have two or three hundred children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren accommodated and employ∣ed respectively as he himself should arbitrarily dic∣tate often perhaps only influenced by the rest∣less lust of rule caprice spleen or unaccountable prejudice In this way children should be incapa∣citated to act as free members of a free state so that such a monopolization and perpetuation of do∣mestic authority would not only interfere with but end in the total abolition of municipal free∣dom political subordination and personal proper∣ty Wisely therefore have all governments in selfpreservation fixt the term of maturity and the boundaries of adolescential subjection in short set children free from all tyes to parents but those of reverence gratitude and affection which are spontaneous conditional duties always at the com∣mand of an excellent and deserving object  With regard to Colonies the precise period of political adultness has not been ascertained For what power is competent to ascertain it There are  no visible existing powers that we know of above the kingdoms of this earth It is therefore the alone province of Heaven to take the lead in this magnificent and magnitudinous affair to fix the  ne plus ultra  of supremacy on the one hand and of submission on the other Heaven indeed has not left the exact limits upon record so as not to be mistaken but the sense and will of Heaven may be clearly made out from the plainest deductions of reason and common sense which in many intricate and doubtful cases are our only guides and the only infallible standard men have upon earth in penetrating the art and disguise of things bring∣ing forward primordial privileges and authenticat∣ing the stamp of derived and delegated power from that possessively underived and undelegated except from Heaven  Should we leave the decision of the matter to parent states the term of Colonian puberty would never arrive States as regulated by mere men are as subject to a wretched poverty of intellect a sordid narrowness of spirit a selfish mediocrity of concession as individuals Selfishness though variously habited and disguised is the character∣istic of polished cultivated humanity except in punctilious attentions to one another among mem∣bers of official departments at levees and in drawingrooms Where shall we find an individu∣al who will coolly and willingly relinquish to an∣other what he looks upon as his sole property and the chief support of his personal significance among mankind Or where shall we find a great kingdom that will coolly and willingly relinquish to a Colo∣nian rival or cotemporary in power what it looks upon as its sole property and the chief support of its territorial signification among nations We must not seek for either instance in the latitudes of our  earth Yet the negative of conduct thrown into in∣terrogation here with respect to individuals is the opprobrium of our nature and the malady of all societies one set of men gorged to the throat with luxury another set starving but for our alms on our dunghills and with respect to nations the same negative was the destruction of the Grecian and Roman empires which instead of supporting themselves at the zenith of power and glory by the means that acquired them internal virtue tempe∣rance and piety vainly thought to consolidate uni∣versal dominion by exorbitant exactions and arbi∣trary stretches of authority in their distant provin∣ces and colonies whereby they roused up such a spirit of dissatisfaction and resentment in the members against the head as soon issued assisted by interior vice immorality and licentiousness in their final ruin and extinction Particular king∣doms therefore must not be admitted umpires to decide the weighty and momentous question of Co∣lonian maturity or ripeness for selfgovernment  A kingdom to all eternity were kingdoms eter∣nal would no more give up its Colonies to the liber∣ty and independence itself enjoys than a tyranni∣cal unnatural parent would wish to liberate a son from his jurisdiction were he not liable to be for∣ced by the law of his country and indeed in most cases by the necessity of the thing itself But let the consequences be seriously and candidly marked  Were there no compulsory statutes for the libe∣ration of children from their parents at a specified time parents even the most opulent would not be able to maintain their successions of offspring except in wretchedness and penury which in a ve∣ry few generations would reduce the wealthiest na∣tions to the condition of Indians living on the un∣cultivated  fruits of the earth and the unsolicited fish crowding to their shores And even should industry be admitted to take place between a fa∣ther and his sons still the admission is shackled with an absurdity impossible to be thrown off which would shortly annihilate the whole paterfamilial dynasty In instances of disagreements between fa∣ther and son disagreements not in the nature of things to be avoided strength bodily strength would be the  lex ultima judicandi  as force is confess∣edly the  ultima ratio regum  A son might be very often stronger than his father or two or more sons might conspire against a father and subdue him whereby the whole domestic chain of government would be unlinked while brawny limbs and ath∣letic shoulders not wise heads and experienced hoary locks would bear off the chaplet of victory and the younger reign in the elder's stead  Thus it appears that the adult domestic period has been established in all well regulated States with a degree of sapient foresight on which their existence as well as property depends The adult period of Colonies comes next to be consi∣dered Such a period it has been observed would never arrive were it left to the option and discre∣tion of the Colonian parent But notwithstanding this peevish impoverished and jaundiced maxim of State shall it never arrive This is just saying with more illiterate dogmatism than truth that States shall never grow old diseased enfeebled and decrepit i e it is an attempt to stop the course of Nature arrest the progress of mortal labefaction and check the material dissolution of parts suspend the attrition of wheels and coun∣teract the wearing of machinery States are sub∣ject to all the vicissitudes of the human body like it must increase decrease and moulder into dust  Shall an old palsied man then wrestle with the young and vigorous the diseased with the heal∣thy the weaker with the strongerIn other words shall parent States be eternal and shall Colonies never become parent States Absurd and fanciful indeedMark the extravagance and selfdelusion here In many supposable cases not to mention cases that have really happened Colonies may become greater wealthier and more pow∣erful than the birthgiving State At such a cri∣sis what is to be done Shall the lesser legislatively controul the greater The poorer the wealthier Or the weaker the strongerThe questions would seem to answer themselves and may be left to Lord North himself if he has not altogether abandoned the sterling currency of Idea and Lan∣guage the reverse of his conduct with regard to the coin and has not folded up for ever and for ever the uncorporational rectitude and integrity of things in the plaitings of his Aulicrobe or the duplications of his Blue Ribbon  All nations upon earth were once Colonies ex∣cept the first stationary spot of its inhabitants and even that may be called a Colony from Hea∣ven at least so long as the disposition of Heaven reigned there peace love friendship and con∣tent All nations were once in the most helpless condition of infant territory and nascent civiliza∣tion How have these Colonies expiated the guilt of their becoming great and flourishing kingdoms the terror and admiration of the world the Ethi∣opic the Grecian and the Roman Lord North and his conclave of Senators ought to write male∣dictory epitaphs to their memory send some of their order from their silent or abused seats in Parliament upon an eastern tour and there in∣stead of falling down on their knees with sepul∣chral  decency unutterable consciousness and holy admiration spurn the ashes of their dead Ge∣nerals Heroes and Orators trample on the mar∣morean relics of their glory and deface the in∣gravements of their unenvied immortality They should find no interruption in the solitude of their exploits as their consciences were left behind them but from the remonstrances of awakened echoes or the inarticulated murmurings of pas∣sing winds  The progress from Colonian nonage and imbe∣cility to the adultness and lustihood of empire has been as observable since the beginning of time as the growth of the human body from in∣fancy to manhood The world may be called a great body made up of continents islands em∣pires kingdoms principalities and states its in∣dividuals in a  figurative  sense a kingdom likewise is a great lesser body made up of men and women its individuals in a  real  sense Men and Women have a progression of growth from birth to the period of legal maturity Nothing can obstruct or limit this regular growth without doing vio∣lence to God and Nature as well as society a crime multiform and penal equal to mutilation maiming dismembering partially robbing life of its subsistence or totally destroying it Empires kingdoms and states have likewise a progression of increase from their first colonizing existence to the ripened aera of their independence nothing can obstruct or limit this regular increase without doing violence to God in the first instance the King of  all  kings and the Lord of  all  lords a crime for which kings ministers and parliaments must be one day as responsible as those tyrants and monsters that would by external implements  and force a thing quite possible stop the growth of an infant to a child of a child to a youth or of a youth to a man  This seems to be the true and unaffected view of the subject unwarpt by party and unallied to worldly hopes and fears which alas too often serve to silence the voice of truth fully its bright∣ness or muddy its channels It is so obvious and reasonable that I cannot help wondering it does not strike every mind left to its own freedom and not abashed to borrow light from Christianity that admirable but not half enough admired system of right conduct pure equity disinterested justice genuine ambition refined morals exquisite philo∣sophy gentle affections and generous principles without which adopted and revered in courts and cabinets no kingdoms can rise to greatness be∣come greatness or secure greatness any more than individuals This I would assert and hand down to posterity could any thing of mine reach poste∣rity under every circumstance of discouragement and unpopularity and notwithstanding the accom∣modated reasonings of Dr Johnson Dean Tucker and Sir John Dalrymple without forgetting to mention our little tabernacle politician though in∣deed nothing better than a dangling satellite at the belt of Jupiter Though blunt and bold truths coming unawares upon men and overturning ac∣customed modes of thinking at first rather tend to fix the character of extreme singularity on the author than to convince the reader yet a time will come when the unrestrained powers of reflec∣tion and the natural good sense of mankind will take the lead of habit fashion and prejudice like reaction recovering that is reinstating what was lost by simple action or pressure or to speak more Justly like condensed air and concentrated sun∣beams regaining that medium and expansion  made their natural properties by the great Creator and best accommodated to general use and benefit  Many people in the official departments of the State who somehow or other imagine themselves called upon to defend Government at all hazards whether right or wrong will probably be very rea∣dy to exclaim against the bold and free spirit of these remarks not  spying the beam in their own eye  Politicians indeed are not obliged to be good Christians They will call them Republican and in their latitude and tendency dangerous to civil Administration as well as disrespectful to the K Yet such persons will as probably never reflect that while the foregoing remarks can only do imaginary harm even upon their own suppositi∣on of their being dangerous they themselves do substantial irreparable harm to the State to their King and Country by the dissoluteness and profli∣gacy of their live It scarcely can be denied that most of our Rulers are men of gross morals and ir∣religious private conduct It may be argued they are not worse than other members of the State But if they are no better they are virtually worse as persons in power and trust ought to be exem∣plary for superior and uncommon virtues The routine of public worship is not religion though from the throne to the cottage it unaccountably passes as such  Luxury effeminacy and sensuality these are the hydra evils that hurt a State sap the foundati∣ons of Government and undermine slowly but surely the platform of municipal freedom while the Essay Writer with the worst intentions only gives the world an opportunity to examine and in cases of error in his positions of confuting him Hereby Government in truth acquires additional strength splendor and beauty instead of being  injured No theoretical reasoning or speculative opinions can disturb or periclitate a State though they may disturb and periclitate men in the possessi∣on of abused power and illacquired opulence If bad they are easily answered and as assignable to oblivion as rockets and soapbubbles into air If good that is founded on unalterable maxims and the general convictions of mankind no oppo∣sition can suppress them nay the opposition of courts and hierarchies will add to their currency and effect But what remedy can radically con∣quer national degeneracy a depravity of manners infecting the whole bodypolitic with fashion and breeding and the Clergy their grand allies  The command of the powers of a State and selfcommand being at the head of Government and at the head of selfgovernment are quite dif∣ferent things Ministers without the last can never acquit themselves honourably or successfully with respect to the first Private virtue is the only foundation of public as the whole can no other way be made up but of the parts and  public vir∣tue  is the only secure basis of national peace free∣dom prosperity and glory To loosen the links of this chain were to disjoin vegetable circulatory life and the growth of the oak or to separate light and heat from the body of the sun Alas while the ostensible friends and servants of Government are sending out mighty fleets and armies to sup∣port what they are pleased to call the honour and character of the nation they tarnish its true honour and character in the private paths of life i e while they stick a feather in Britannia's cap they are aiming a dagger at her heart by the vicious dissipation corrupt prodigality and pleasurable ex∣travagance of their lives Fleets and armies in this case are no more than the bravadoing of pre∣sumption  and confidence and demonstrate a mode of procedure in our rulers totally inconsistent and ajar with itselfWhat their fleets and armies may be supposed to do abroad our  gubernatorial  great men are more than undoing at home by their scandalous vices and glaring immoralities Are these the pillars of the realm Of government Of monarchy Yes but they are rotten pillars that must shortly give way and bury in their ruins the glorious and superb sabric of British Liberty with∣out even the consolation of one truly valiant vir∣tuous man like him of  Gaza  to consecrate the mighty devastation  While our parliamentary court leaders our ca∣binet and privy counsellors by means of the basest venality breach of honour and breach of integrity to their constitutional masters the People get the public money into their hands to squander away on parade of living a false style of life profusion licentiousness and libertinism the overthrow of the once illustrious empires of Greece and Rome to squander away

disregard for Posterity a death or lifegiving Posterity into whose temple no tyrant or satrap of a tyrant is ad∣mittedIt may be just mentioned here that even the clergy have taken an active part

Philosophy and Revela∣tion as well as politics conspire to form a patriot K and statesman kings and statesmen would not only consider the legislative supremacy of a state as defi∣nable but the Limits of Empire likewise terminable Generally speaking the less extended and stretched  any of them be on the juster and surer basis it rests If one has a right to assume jurisdictive Omnipo∣tence in all cases whatsoever every State hath however different in internal conformation wis∣dom virtue and policy but no state can have it but from Colonian derivation teritorial increment and gradual accretion of numbers associating toge∣ther therefore all Colonies that can keep off the attacks of foreign invaders let them be who they will whether quondam friends or hereditary ene¦mies so as to attend uninterruptedly to interior im∣provement and cultivation may attain to that opu∣lence and strength on which alone the so much boasted supremacy of states can be founded The ruling legislative powers of one state indeed may truly be styled supreme and infallible with regard to the ruling powers of any other state but that these ruling powers should arrogate supremacy in a state within which they originated and are con∣tingently liable to be curtailed and destroyed is such an instance of extreme human vanity in rulers and governors as will serve to sanctify all the exe∣crable Tyrants that have ever deformed and dis∣honoured the Earth or ever shall  We have already seen that all Kingdoms with∣out exception were once Colonies it is only step∣ping high enough up in the Records of Time to be as certainly convinced of this as that every Man was once a Boy and every Parent once a Child Even GreatBritain itself now standing on the pin∣nacle of Selfeulogy and Selfidolization is an ex∣ample of it What was right fit lawful neces∣sary expedient and practicable two four six thousand Years ago if we may suppose the World so old is right fit lawful necessary expedient and practicable now in the Year MDCCLXXVI of the Christian aera If Politicians and Courtiers  can advance any thing in redarguation they must recur to that pitiful policy which we call Corpora∣tional by way of stigma and reproach a policy which would stimulate GreatBritain to plunder and destroy France Spain Germany and all the nations of the Earth WERE SHE ABLE For one Kingdom has no more right from God the Guar∣dian and Protector of Kingdoms to rob and de∣stroy another than one individual has to rob and destroy another individual In the latter case it would be  private  felony and murder in the for∣mer public complicated unbounded undefina∣ble Felony and Murder With regard to the pri∣vate commissions of offences so atrocious all civi∣lized States have appointed the most awful Tribu∣nals and exemplary punishments indeed in simple selfpreservation as Robbers and Murderers un∣checked would throw all Kingdoms into uproar distraction and misery Is it to be supposed then that in public national Commissions of the same a∣trocious offences God the King and Judge su∣preme of all the Earth will take no cognizance appoint no judicial Bars of Trial no final punitive award Then should God exhibit himself to Crea∣tion as inferior to an earthly Sovereign in sagaci∣ty foresight and prudence as in consequence of these public enormous commissions if unre∣strained by his unseen but Almighty Interference his general dominion of our World consisting of all the Governments now established among man∣kind would be thrown into anarchy tumultuati∣on and blood while one daring successful tyran∣ny would overspread the face of the whole Earth and swallow up his providential and gradually evolving plans of future peace virtue and happi∣ness The analogy cannot be broken without break∣ing the entire chain of Nature and Things  Chaste and enlightened ideas of our specific situ∣ation as subjects of God who not only reigns over us with a jealous anxiety about the performance of our duty to Him but who created us also must always be our rule of conduct when contempla∣ting ourselves the subjects of an earthly Prince who under God equally  his  King as ours has no farther right to claim Subjection from us if at any Time clashing with our Subjection to God the higher Power than a Viceroy or Embassador has to claim Subjection manifestly and of right only claimable by Him they represent The analogy stands upon impregnable ground  Implicit unexaminable submission to Kings and Governors i  really excellent by taking their line of Administration from God the supreme King and Governor might be safely acquiesced in and submitted to but when or where has the world hitherto found when or where shall the world in future find such prodigies  A strange Phenomenona Blackbird white  Owls basking joyous in the blaze of Light  Extraord'naries indeedSoot chang'd from black  And Down and Plumage on a Hedgehog's Back  An excellent King would be one of the most marvellous spectacles upon Earth as temptations nearly infinite and almost invincible solicit him on all hands to be the very reverse A bad King is as consequentially to be expected as that frail fragile mortals will generally give way to the seductions of power pleasure voluptuousness and flattery Perhaps half a million of Kings have reigned in the various parts of the earth of whom it may not uncharitably be said that scarce a thousand have been truly excellent This disproportion is im∣mense but not more immense than within the boundaries of fair calculation Let it be remem∣bered  that our term of calculational comparison is  truly excellent  and if not truly excellent there certainly lies an appeal from all Kings let their extrinsic Glory Majesty and Terror be what they may to a higher Power not barely in Truth ex∣cellent but  the Most Excellent  Every individual is judge of this appeal If the conviction of its ne∣cessity and rectitude should expose him to present pains and amercements he has that indemnifica∣tion in his own bosom which no tyrant or arbitra∣ry court can take away because they can neither see it nor feel it as an object of envy jealousy or appetency And even should it expose him to the loss of life still the loss of life would be an acquisition compared with the loss of conscience not to mention that the loss of life would but the sooner send him to  that  tribunal and to  that  judge who instituted the appeal and will impartially hear it  Upon the above principles Colonies have an heavenimparted right prior and paramount to all Charters to become Empires  when they can  that is in consequence of internal exertion and indust∣ry without invading the  home property  and impe∣rial immunities of other countries or kingdoms This inference is also obvious that to contravene and impede them under any pretext whatsoever in their progress from the nonage to the fullage of Empire would be the same thing as to lay the impious hand of Despotism on Arts and Science on Virtue and Industry on Agriculture and Ma∣nufactures on Trade and Commerce the even∣tual unfoldings of the Human Mind divine the diversified operations of Genius and the Under∣standing the unavoidable spontaneous result of all which in the course and issue of things is  Dominion Empire Independence  In consequence  of these the Creation of God instead of being rude and untrodden a wild and howling wilder∣ness becomes a second time the Garden of Eden and a prelude to the grand final Reintegration of Nature Let  these  be confined to one spot one island or one continent the restoration of things would never happen three parts out of four of our earth would be a dreary unhospitable region not fit for a sunburned Indian to make his way thro' instead of a God to revisit and the greatest pro∣portion of mankind be wretched slaves or more wretched sycophants But when God revisits our earth in any special manifestation of himself it will not be to cast his eye around on slaves but to reign among Freemen and not to behold Mo∣narchs raised as a sort of rivalgods above subjects but to behold them levelled with subjects and all alike His subjectsTo stop the course of Colo∣nization therefore towards independence is to supercede the decrees of Heaven and obstruct the necessary evolutions of Divine Providence All empires and kingdoms degenerate into tyranny Tyranny is the plethoric disease of states as the gout or jaundice is of corpulency The last state upon earth must be  absolutely and perfectly free  be∣cause the remove from that to Heaven will be im∣mediate It is a counteraction then of the sublime revolutionary scheme of Heaven to prevent the progress of infant Colonies and States when we are not actually attacked in our property at home which justly speaking is a Nation's only rightful property every thing else being the effect and ac∣quisition of conquest violent possession barbarity rapine and blood Nor can I help deploring that GreatBritain is now effectually punished by an in∣visible hand through the medium of that very Continent which she unjustifiably took possession of  at first from the unoffending native inhabitants who had as good a claim of property to that West∣ern Continent as we to any part of the Northern This will be called superstition perhaps Yet I am no Moravian or Methodist no high or low churchman no Puritan or Seceder but in short a simple believer without having  confessed  or  articled  myself to any Sect so that no sect or par∣ty need be at the trouble to assume the honour of me or throw off the discredit of me I have never broken the Peace nor ever will while in my wits and senses I love my Country and King and assist both with my purse whenever they have any legitimate demand upon it and should they ever be involved in the defence of true Liberty whether  religious  or  civil  with foreign assailants I will rec∣kon my life as taxable as my purse Yet notwith∣standing all this professionary detail I cannot sup∣press my sentiments on American affairs cannot help thinking we are wrong  kicking against the pricks  and  fighting against God  in so far as we would destroy the freedom and property of a great people placed in a distant quarter of the world and hast∣ening fast under the eye of an auspicious Provi∣dence to political maturity and hardihood whom we would ignobly depress and retard in their shoot∣ing out into the vigour of a free and independent Government because we have abused and adulte∣rated true Government ourselves stretching our depredations and massacres not only to the Eastern but Western world as if the Supreme Lord of the world  by whom Kings reign and Princes decree just∣ice  will not avenge blood the blood of thousands and ten thousands under whatever pretence shed short of actual selfpreservation Were the Asiatic or the North American Indians insulting our bor∣ders or pirating on our coasts No their igno∣rance  of Navigation secured them from the guilt of murder and robbery in ten thousand instances now crying aloud for vengeance on the head of GreatBritain  Put up thy sword into its sheath for they that take the sword shall perish by the sword Vengeance is mine and I will repay it saith the Lord  Scripture to my Lord North's or my Lord Mansfield's nerve of hearing will be quite unparlia∣mentary unforensic and untechnical but Scripture is the politics of Heaven nor can I sup∣pose with all their courtly refinement and breed∣ing that any noble Lords in Administration will take upon them to aver that the politics of St James's are the politics of Heaven If not let them then refrain from palming  their  intolerant plans of taxational policy on distant latitudes and regions that positively will not accept of them be∣cause they cannot as Freemen born and Trustees accountable to Posterity unless by force violence and bloodshed overpowered by numbers and re∣duced to slavery in which depressed degraded state they should seem little worth the acceptance of a great generous virtuous and pious Monarch To rule over slaves is the spirit and ambition of Sa∣tan who views a  freeman  with the same contorted countenance and squinteyed malignity that he would view an angel from HeavenLet then our highprerogative senators our boastful asserters of supreme Legislation be told that to deny colonies the freedom they themselves enjoy without deser∣ving it better is a colossian stride towards defpo∣tism the disgrace of manhood and the degrada∣tion of our species beside being such an overex∣ertion of authority as a Parent would be justly condemnable for who would attempt to overrule his children's freeagency after they had come of age that is been accounted competent by the  laws of God and man to will and act for them∣selves  Many people affecting to be thought sensible and knowing shrewdly remark that the Ameri∣cans have begun a century too soon to set up the standard of INDEPENDENCE Such shrewd re∣markers must suppose that  right  and  justice  have a growth a state of unripeness and maturity like animals and vegetables and that actions essentially criminal now will not be so an hundred years hence in other words what is actual rebellion now will in a few generations become heroic spi∣rit and virtuous magnanimity By the same pro∣cess of reasoning white will become black in due time and snow hot a courtier honest and a playactor shamefaced  Opinions manners fashions change with times  The cast of virtues and the cast of crimes  But HONESTY God's image in the soul  Changes but with the needle and the pole  So uncomprehensive a knowledge of things so shallow an acquaintance with the history of na∣tions the progress of society and origin of go∣vernment would seem scarcely worth recital much less an elaborate refutation Remarks indeed of this kind are generally in the mouth of men that enjoy emoluments under the crown but who would wish to have the appearance of candor and moderation i e hug their filthy lucre at the same time that they would not be thought seduced from truth and integrity by filthy lucre The du∣plicity every mortal perceives but themselves  It is truly a laughable circumstance in a serious affair that GreatBritain should first qualify and enable the colonies to do for themselves indepen∣dent of the parent that begat them and then cry out on their undutifulness and ingratitude for ac∣ting  in this line of qualification and capacity Should a father give his son a patrimony or capital to carry on the business or trade he had instructed him in and afterwards reprimand and punish him for disobedience because he made use of that very capital and applied himself effectually to business what might we think of such a father The answer to the question involves the deepest crimination of the present ministry The charge of ingratitude lies not at the door of the colonies but the charge of inconsistency and preposterous conduct lies at the door of the Premier and his conclave speaking in the name of GreatBritain but like many other interpreters speaking interestedly arbitrarily and deceitfully  Providence has great and important revolutions to bring about in the world before it become what we are assured by the prophetic Spirit it must be∣come before the termination of all things God originally was the only acknowledged King among mankind but as soon as vice wickedness and ido∣latry began to prevail men in different societies and dynasties appointed Kings for themselves God continuing to be their King by the embassado∣rial medium of teachers and prophets would have been a constant troublesome admonitory check on their enormities an awful living evidence against them Resolved therefore upon immorality and the grossest corruptions they agreed to emancipate themselves from Heaven and choose Kings and rulers that they well knew would be as immoral and corrupt as themselves nay in many instances take the lead in every abomination The Jewish nation was one remarkable instance of this we have it upon the most authentic record While they preserved primaeval innocence and simplicity they rejoiced and were blessed in their theocratic  polity but when they became debased and pollu∣ted by the Heathen nations around and captivated with their vain kingly pageantry they boldly and riotously demanded an earthly king from Samuel the messenger of Heaven as they themselves ex∣press it  that we may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles  The degeneracy of the Jews and their lust after a visible temporal King in imitation of the Pagan world commenced together which demonstrates a degree of analogy between kingly domination and the unrestrained practice of private vice and corruption not to be resisted As immedi∣ate communications with Heaven would always have had the effect of controuling base and unworthy passions therefore so soon as mankind wished freely to indulge them they were restless and un∣happy till that communication was cut off Since that fatal and degrading epoch things have conti∣nued in the channel of licentiousness and debauch∣ery to this day Courts generally speaking are the centre and licensed purlieus of corruption vice and immorality with a gauzethin decorum and breeding indeed that would gild and varnish the want of virtue and integrity But things will not cannot last long in this retrograde path of re∣formation and moral improvement As the world first began with the theocratic form of government it will certainly also end with it how far soever we really are at present from it Kings and kingdoms are opposing and counteracting one another while they all alike wallow in the foulest vices and crimes Thus in the end they will destroy one another or be destroyed by formidable evils from Heaven till the insuperable necessity shall stare men in the face of recurring to the first institution of all Theocracy in the mean time fitting themselves for  it by the practice of moral virtues and piety to∣wards God  Before this glorious and happy renovation how∣ever can take place mankind must have the most generous pure and exquisite conceptions of Li∣berty quite the reverse of what it is at this igno∣minious day throughout the world if we except those critical unparalleled and astonishing struggles in one great continental division of it God can∣not act sentimentally in arbitrary governments or among slaves till he first work a miracle by instan∣taneously changing mens minds Such instru∣ments would never push forward schemes destruc∣tive of themselves which all schemes of manly freedom virtuous independence and moral selfdenial would be nor can a thorough reformation of manners and principles take place in any State where a political establishment of religion subsists because such a reformation would be an act of dis∣sent and nonconformity altogether subversive of that establishment Besides in all national esta∣blishments the showy appearance of duty pompous rites and ceremonies take off from mens reverence for the reality nay actually supercede it in nine hundred and ninety instances of a thousand When we have proved to our fellowcreatures that we are religious by going to the same place of public worship and uttering over and over the same re∣sponses with them we seldom think of any thing farther I keep my neighbour in countenance and my neighbour keeps me over and above that my neighbour is always before my eyes but God is invisible GreatBritain and Ireland there∣fore with sorrow and pain I make the observati∣on can never be made instrumental to bring about those grand political restorations and religious re∣forms which some time or another certainly must  happen Should they ever be effected in these kingdoms it must be through the medium of per∣sons unconnected by corruption with the court and by creeds with a national hierarchy Courts and hierarchies  swear  and  take bribes  to preserve inviolate their respective institutions how then can they be made instruments to perjure themselves and save highwaymen the trouble by picking their own pockets moreover Truth requires no forms of adjuration among its friends nor Virtue any undue influence to be used to insure its practice Heaven is not reduced to such pitiful shifts  There are now two great quarters of the globe occupied by  Christian freemen  many of them Bri∣tons or the descendants of Britons undebauched by a corrupt and vicious court and unembarras∣sed by a religious establishment I mean our com∣mercial territory in the East Indies and the vast Western Continent of America especially the lat∣ter Great mighty and illustrious things may be expected from America where men have not sworn and subscribed to one another to limit their municipal and religious knowledge consequently are open and unengaged for the inspirations of Heaven the manly exertions of generous enter∣prize and the illimitable extensions of improvement on every object of literary discussion and scientific research There unoccupied territorial boundless∣ness furnished with every thing Nature can pro∣duce or Art require except gold and silver mines the pandemonium of states affords infinite re∣sources to a bold free brave spirited ingenious quicksighted adventuring people A people un∣debased by hereditary subjection to civil or religi∣ous tyrants haughty pampered statesmen or bi∣shops no less haughty and pampered Blessed situ∣ation enviable climeSuch would seem a the∣atre  somewhat worthy a Divine Being to act upon and not an insular corner of the earth possessed by a people quite corpulent and diseased with luxury corrupted and debauched by their nobles and gentry their corrupters and debauchers themselves abandoned to gamingtables and horseraces and prostituted to masquerades and brothelstheir parliaments pinned to the minister's sleeve and their elections carried on by perjury and Asiatic goldAn insular nookwhere the inhabitants have not elbowroom without emigrating by thou∣sands to distant shores nor their consciences fair play but through the tolerating grace and favour of  spiritual lorders over the Heritage of God  my lords the Bishopswhere art has got the better of inno∣cence and hypocrisy of virtueand where every thing sells at an high marketable price butwis∣dom and integrityFrom this glorious Con∣tinent doubtless in due time Civil and Religious Liberty light and knowledge will spread over all the nations of the world now mostly merged in disgraceful slavery groaning under royal despots the curse of their species or kissing the obscene toes of insolent timeserving ecclesiastics Such an infinity of human beings  seeming  content and happy in their worse than bestial servitude is no proof of their being so In many cases their torpid acquiescence and insensibility is an aggra∣vation or rather the emphasis of their misery the dead signposts of their bondage the antesepul∣chral escutcheons of their unutterable wretched∣ness  Whether the period is  now  that America shall stand forth high and respectable on the scale of nations or an hundred years hence it matters not nor does it affect our general argument When∣ever it happens GreatBritain must yield the palm  of Empire and whether she yields it now or a century hence is a point of no material conse∣quence to a true patriotic philosopher or philoso∣phical Briton who would aspire to have a stand∣ard beyond times and seasonsone thing howe∣ver cannot escape present animadversion Lest PROVIDENCE should mistake the proper crisis to call forth the Americans to Empire and Indepen∣dence Lord N and his Conclave have thought it meet to push them to the grand eclaircissement by anticipation backed by his myrmidons of the quill Dalrymple Shebbeare Tucker Johnson not for∣getting his Lordship's goosefeather champion the Rev John Wesley M A  That excellent philosopher critic and politician Lord KAIMS has discovered so sagacious and prophetic a spirit with regard to America in his Sketches of the History of Man article "Progress of States" that I cannot resist the temptation of inserting it here It was probably composed before our troubles began "Our NorthAmerican colonies are in a prosperous condition increasing rapidly in population and opulence The colo∣nies have the spirit of a free people and are inflamed with patriotism Their population will equal that of Bri∣tain and Ireland in less than a century and they will then be a match for the mother country if they chuse to be independent every advantage will be on their side as the attack must be by sea from a very great distance" Sketches of the History of Man article Progress of States Book II Sketch IV  In truth our dispute with the Colonies seems to be a quarrel of the Minister's from official pique resentment and mortification rather than a war upon noble manly equitable principles And however it may cast up on the wheel of contingen∣cies the disinvolution of which often times de∣pend on mediums of discernment and tests of scrutiny seldom within the reach of mortals tho'  the events of war have hitherto been mostly in favour of the Americans the Minister can never descend to his grave in peace should he not have previously made it up with his God for fashion's sake we will suppose a Prime Minister acknowledges a God for the slaughter of his creatures the rob∣bery of their possessions and the destruction of their habitationsThe casting vote of parliament or a privy council nay even the approbatory smile of his Sovereign will not cannot acquit him at the tribunal of his Maker perhaps not far off for want only and vindictively imbruing his hands in the blood of fellow mennot merely fellow men but fellow Christiansnot merely fellow Christians but fellow ProtestantsFor what because the descendants of Britons would not prove themselves less than Britons or unworthy of the name by submitting to be amerced and dragooned like slaves into subjection unmindful of their parentage and unconscious of the image of God Freedom in their foreheadsIt may likewise be remarked here that Kings how∣ever at present surrounded with sycophants and flatterers pledging themselves  he is right  whose reigns have been marked with superserviceable war and stained with unnecessary blood the blood of their EQUALS in every respect except a crown which the most worthless and abandoned oftentimes wear generally die unlamented and are seldom recalled to mind by posterity a discern∣ing impartial equitable because an uncloseted and unpensioned Posterity but to be execrated  Vice weakness folly first seduc'd mankind  Body alas triumphant o'er the mind  To choose that  thing  of pageantry and straw  We call a king law's guardian without law  When good kings more than humanly excel  Badare the representatives ofhell  All the palladiums of the state seem to be giving way one by one insomuch that very soon it will have nothing to exhibit but the effigies or mummy of what it once has been the dead lion kicked and insulted by every longeared animal passing by of a particular species that knows to trudge on hum∣ble and submiss in the trammels of a Minister or hold up its obscene mouth in the House to bray for a pensionA system of corruption has pervad∣ed the entire body politic as certainly to consume and destroy it as a putrifactive taint the human circulating with its juices and debilitating its so∣lids From the Premier to the meanest clerk in office from the court at St James's down to the poorest country village the fatal infection prevails and diffuses itself the first minister and confidant of royalty bribed for his talents and oratory and the fortyshilling freeholder bribed for his vote at elections A constitution thus supported in oppo∣sition to the faith truth and integrity of things which amounts to a defiance of Heaven cannot last long and really the sooner it comes to an end provided its internal powers of restoration and re∣form are sunk beyond hope and expectation what∣ever may be the previous convulsion the better infinitely GOD the patron of virtue probity and rectitude not only authorizes the total de∣struction of such a system but will likewise pro∣pitiate and guarantee the renovation Even our world put on its present beauteous and glorious form in consequence of a chaos nor would the  deluvian period  ever have happened but as a re∣medy for the irrecoverable wickedness and depra∣vity of mankind before the flood The power that made and has all a long sustained a constituti∣on if in the hands of unfaithful and arbitrary go∣vernors it counteracts its original purposes and  has a certain unequivocal tendency to overthrow the personal freedom of the subject for the guar∣dianship of which it was alone conceived and elabo∣rated such a power I say may and ought to  un∣make and break it to pieces  in order to throw the materials into a more perfect mold to produce a more perfect impression The People the aggre∣gate powergiving body of the state are the almigh∣ty and unresponsible cause here alluded to as alone adequate to such an effect  A political constitution is like a clock or a watch as being of artificial structure and durability With∣out any imputable guilt or feeling of remorse the artist takes the latter machinery asunder when the wheels and springs have been obstructed or worn down beyond repair and substitutes new in their place The former piece of machinery though of the highest order of human device and fabrication must likewise be taken asunder as often as its de∣fects become irreparable and its wastes unsupplia∣ble neither is there delinquency or any cause for compunction in the one case more than the other Indeed as they differ preeminently in excellence and value the care the accurate inspection the delicate demur the deliberative matureness of fi∣nal judgment should in an equal degree be pre∣eminent respecting the one instance above the other By the unquestionable analogy between the first and the last staring them in the face in all free states the executive servants of government the official members of the empire are kept in order and long effectually prevented from running into the excesses of tyranny and aristocraticism The whole position is rational and perfectly consistent with itself  Kings and statesmen without the People to feed clothe and defend them should be nothing more  reputable or stable in their high situations than corks blown about by the winds on the surface of the waters or buoys cut away from their anchors Kings and ministers of state while they so unac∣countably  idolize  themselves and accept of  idolatry  from all around them the abject homage paid them deserves no other name think not of the a∣bove humiliating circumstance which reduces them from their receptoffices of incense to the butterfly deprived of his wings or the master bee disarmed of his sting  The elected representative magistratical depart∣ments of society have presumed so extravagantly on their derived and adventitious greatness have taken such gigantic strides in office towards despotism that they must indeed be brought to their proper level prostrate in submission at the footstool of their creatorsthe People  By the People I would not be understood to mean a riotous mob a tumult at the marketcross or a county insurrection from which at all times  good God deliver us  but the honourable and re∣spectable Yeomanry of the realm the middle class of citizens and country gentry whose wealth in the gross is the principal wealth of the nation and support of government and whose education principles studies and manners qualify and intitle them to direct the lowest orders of society and controul the highest should  these  to any dangerous length exceed their delegated trust or  those  disco∣ver a forwardness to rush into hasty association and violent insurgency  Nothing can be a stronger proof of our degene∣racy infatuation and ripeness for some revoluti∣on that will severely punish while it brings us to our senses and reforms us than two considerations which shall now be mentioned with brevity but  pointedness While the British empire is in the state of being rent like a garment from top to bot∣tom while British glory has been brought under a total eclipse and British honour passes as a problem among the nations the sons of Britain in a dis∣eased trance of ignoble ambition are soliciting and procuring vain empty titles from the crown which in the absence of virtue are no more than the co∣lours flying of a ship after its hulk has been eaten through and through with worms or her rudder cables and anchors lost in a Storm The m ott after having brought his own into dispute and endangered the real honour of the nation by grasping at too much power and dominion and set one part of his sub to rob and murder the other consoles himself with throwing away fictiti∣ous nominal honours the disposal of which was lodged with him by the People for a quite different purpose on men whose only merit consists in hu∣mouring and flattering him in Pars and Priv Couns This consideration at once serves to point out the political disease of the times and its apparent eventual termination The other is this In the above recited melancholy situation of public affairs our nobles and gentry instead of being roused to selfreformation and hereby the only possible method recommending the fleets and armies of Britain to the protection and blessing of Hea∣ven are hurrying into every scene of vice folly dissipation and debauchery horseraces cockfights gambling tables masquerades pantomimes farces and stews while the public teachers of the land the clergy either look on with total uncon∣cern or actually partake themselves of such illtimed pleasures and amusements the lawnsleeve bishop and his powdered chaplain equally lost to a sense of honour and duty This is a fact notorious to  every eye and in the face of the sun calls upon Heaven to punish us as a nation and People GOD however brings good out of evil He has made us instruments to render a  great Continent  wise at our expence to check the inhabitants in their ca∣reer of luxury and recal them to the almost desert∣ed paths of piety and virtue and hereby opened an  immense future asylum  for the good of all nations the distressed and persecuted of all regionsIt is acknowledged in the midst of this black and dismal prospect the Colonies  defending themselves  in a state of formidable revolt and France and Spain ready to take advantage of our blundering and distracted councils our wretched national na∣kedness and imbecility that the  fashionable routine  of public worship like most other  fashions  on sundays and holidays goes regularly on but alas in this respect we are no better than the Jews were of old  scribes and pharisees hypocrites  when CHRIST delivered  this  prediction which was af∣terwards literally accomplished  Master fee what manner of stones and what buildings are here Jesus said unto him seest thou those great buil∣dings  our Cathedrals and Churches  There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down  It is likewise acknowledged that we have had a  public fastday  appointed by authority for Great Britain and Ireland the Priv Coun of E obliged though fomewhat  unbecomely late  to follow the example of the Americans without the pure piety and virtuous patriotism of these determined Continen∣talists but Almighty God has condemned and reprobated for ever all such deceitful hypocriti∣cal service the mere flourish of ambitious tem∣porizing ecclesiastics imposing on the facile unex∣amining spirit of their S the mere  rant  of a party the mere  hueandcry  of a mercenary political establishment Here follow the words of inspiration which  ought  to strike all ks priv couns proclams Right and Most Rev Bishops  dumb for ever Behold  YE  fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness  YE SHALL NOT  fast as  YE  do  THIS DAY  to make  YOUR  voice to be heard in high Is it  SUCH  a fast as I have chosenA day for a man to afflict his  SOUL  Is to bow down his head as a bullrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himIs not  THIS  the fast that I have chosenTo loose the bands of wickednessTo  UNDO  the heavy burdens and to let the  OPPRESSED GO FREE AND THAT YE BREAK EVERY YOKETo conclude the whole  However unfashionable unpopular and un∣courtly the introduction of  Scripture  into a politi∣cal tract I cannot help transcribing here another striking passage from the most venerable book in the world From which it appears that the ordi∣nary business of life going on in its accustomed progressive channel added to the most soothing and flattering ideas of homesecurity instead of forming a barrier against overwhelming general calamities rather tend to create suspicions of their approach when a nation has lost its internal cha∣racter of integrity temperance truth virtue jus∣tice and clemency Notwithstanding our present  seeming  tranquility and safety in Great Britain and Ireland it is certain that the effort towards over∣turning the principles of our  once  happy and en∣vied constitution has been made the stroke of despotism struck in AMERICAThe Americans are Britons by descent as well as we in spirit our equals in genuine patriotism our superiors every article of freedom we enjoy  they  have an equal right to enjoy therefore ministerial oppression ex∣erting  itself  there  is the same thing with regard to the safety and stability of the empire at large as if it had been exerted  here  Tyranny failing in its attempts on the other side the Atlantic we shall be safe at home should it however succeed we shall as surely be undone with the satisfaction indeed the exquisite satisfaction of being the last indulgent∣ly that shall be devoured by the hideous monster But what an act of folly and madness not to be a∣larmed when our neighbour's house is on fire be∣cause the flames have not as yet catched hold of our ownThese are the words of a Personage above all kings and legislators whatsoever  They did eat they drankthey married wivesthey were given in marriageuntil the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all Like∣wise also as it was in the days of Lot they did eat they drankthey boughtthey soldthey planted they buildedbut the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from Heaven and destroyed them all  FINIS
