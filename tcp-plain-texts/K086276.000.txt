Children  STEWARD  to Squire Parks  HUMPHRIES  HEARTY  MEADOWS  Neighbours of Thorowgood  THE HONEST FARMER  SCENE I  The Farmer's House  SCENE I    Martha standing by a table cutting two slices of bread and butter    AFTER having laboured so hard during the best part of our lives thus at last to fall into poverty To what purpose is it that we have never ceased our cares and pains for a single moment in order to breed up our children with credit If they were but of an age to earn their own bread it would be something My dear children it is not for myself it is for you that I shed tears in losing our cattle we have lost our all What remains is far from being sufficient to pay our landlord What is to become of us If my good husband did not support my sinking courage I should  die with grief But how worthy a character he is What a man How tranquil in the midst of our misfortunes Were I not sure that affection makes him conceal the greatest part of his troubles from the fear of afflicting me I should believe he were insensible to them "Why dost thou weep Martha" he often says when I can no longer restrain my tears "We have had a loss it is true but who knows what Providence has in store for us I for my part make that my dependence" Alas though never rich himself he was always a friend to the unfortunate How many families in this village has he saved from misery by his advice and assistance There is not a better man on earth and I still possess what many women want in the midst of riches a worthy husband and children whose good dispositions fill our hearts with joy Whilst I think on these blessings I feel that Providence watches over us and my griefs become lighter Take courage then Martha enough is left to console thee in thy affliction  She advances to the door and calls  Jenny Jenny  SCENE II  Martha Jenny  Jenny  Did you call  Martha  Here my child take thy breakfast  Jenny  Oh my dear mother you have given me above half I cannot eat all this  Martha  No look at it it is no more than thy ordinary portion you are not ill I hope  Jenny  Not at all but I have not so good an appetite as usual  Mar  What is it you tell me How long is it since you have been thus dainty Come come eat your breakfast like a good girl  Jenny  taking the bread and breaking it in two  It is too much I assure you half of it is sufficient for me  She gives the other half to her mother  Here keep this for Lucy  Mar  What has she given you the measure of her appetite I pray  Jenny  This is enough for her I know she will not ask for more  Mar  You seem to think you know your sister wonderous well but I answer for it  Lucy can eat her own share as well as you here is a piece that I have prepared for her  Jenny  No no she will keep that for the evening and then she will give me half in her turn leave us alone we have settled the matter between us  Mar  What means all this I am curious to know  Jenny  Why do you ask me It is a secret between us two I beg dear mother that you will not seem as if you perceived any thing of the matter  Mar  Nay now you increase my curiosity and I must absolutely know the bottom of this  Jenny  Well then since you command it I will tell you all yesterday evening we overheard my father say to you since we have suffered the loss of our cattle we must submit to the will of Heaven and try to turn this misfortune into a blessing we must be the more diligent and industrious and strive with all possible oeconomy to support our family You replied with an embrace that you would be the first to set the example I made a sign to my sister to retire we embraced each other also whatever you had engaged to do for us we agreed together in return to do for you  Mar  My dear children you take too large a share in our troubles they are not suited to your age fear nothing Heaven will have care of you Oh my child you have made me feel the happiness of being a mother What earthly good can equal the joy which this instance of your tender duty has given me but be comforted I have reserved the remainder of this for you and you may at least today eat your bread as usual it is necessary that you should get strength in order to earn something for us when you grow older Will you not be glad to labour for your father and mother  Jenny  Ah glad indeed that I shall but we can begin now our hands it is true are small but we will work the longer for that and all that we earn we will give to my father to purchase more cattle Then we will rear poultry and sell our eggs and this money all this money we will gladly bring to you dear mother  Seeing the tears in her mother's eyes  Oh do not weep I beseech you you make my heart sink  Mar  Be satisfied if I weep it is for joy but it is time that thou should'st breakfast There are many things to do in the house  and I would have thy father find every thing in order at his return  Jenny  Is he gone into the field with my brothers  Mar  No he took a walk down to the hall he wanted to speak with our landlord  Jenny  Oh so much the better My father always came home in good spirits from him That Mr Parks is an excellent man is he not  Mar  Yes my dear hitherto he has been very good to us pray Heaven he may continue to be so now we have occasion for it But since our great losses we are no longer in a condition to pay our rent and often those who have shewn us the greatest kindness whilst we owed them nothing look upon us with a very different eye when they think they are in danger of losing by us  Jenny  Our landlord I am sure is not a man of this sort  Mar  I hope he is not child or we shall be much to be pitied  Jenny  I long for my father's return to hear the good news Will he be back this morning  Mar  He went out at sun rise and I expect him back every minute  Jenny  resting her hand on the table  Then before I breakfast I will go and draw some beer to refresh him he will be glad of a draught after his walk  Mar  No no eat your bread I will take care of that myself  Jenny  You asked me just now whether I would work for my father and mother and now you prevent my doing so  Mar  Do as you will then I will not deprive you of this pleasure your father I know will repay you with his caresses  Jenny  And I do not know which of us is the best pleased when I deserve them and I will do my best to do so  SCENE III  Martha alone  My dear children Heaven is my witness it is chiefly on your account that I dread poverty and yet it is from you that I receive the greatest comfort How much more ought I to love you since you are the only blessing that is left me Had I never been unfortunate I should never have had those proofs of your affection Perhaps also you will assist me in conquering my grief whilst I am only striving to hide it from you No I will not interrupt by my murmurings  the innocent gaity of your tender age  She runs to the cradle takes out the infant and presses it in her arms looking at it with tenderness  It is to thee alone that I will utter my complaints to thee who art as yet insensible to the sorrows of thy parents I may shed tears in thy presence without fearing to afflict thee Happy infant I weep for thy lot whilst thou answerest me with a smile  SCENE IV  Martha Jenny  Jenny  coming in just as Martha has the child in her arms  Give it to me mother that I may kiss it My little friend when you are as able as I am you shall work for your father and mother too Oh you shall see what care I will take of this little baby that it may become strong and robust But stay we are busy at present you must go sleep a little    She puts it back into the cradle whilst the mother looks affectionately at them both    Mother I have just brought the beer will you lend me the key of the cupboard that I may fetch some clean linen and a waistcoat for my father I know he will return overcome with heat and fatigue  Mar  Aye and if he has any good news  he will not care how much he fatigues himself in order to hasten to us with it  Jenny  shutting the cupboard and laying the linen on a chair  I know it and then without resting he will go to the field he never loses a moment  Mar  This is a good lesson for us you for example would do well to hasten your breakfast and go to school as soon as you have asked your father's blessing  Jenny  To school Oh no I shall not go there now  Mar  What do you say Jenny Do you not mean to learn to read and write No no my child I hope however we may be reduced to be always able to afford you this instruction though I should be forced to stint myself in common necessaries for it  Jenny  But there will be no occasion for any more expence on that account Does not my brother Valentine read as fluently as our schoolmaster at his desk He will be master to Lucy and me he told me so this morning Sister said he you know that I am allowed half an hour's rest after dinner before I return to work well then if you will during that time begin a lesson with me I will finish it when I come home in the evening You have nothing to do but to apply  diligently and I'll answer for it you will soon be the best scholar in the village Let us begin today and you shall see  Mar  Now was this Valentine's own thought  Jenny  Yes his own indeed mother it would never have come into my head It is I said he who have cost my parents the most being the eldest had they spent less on me they would have had the money for you my sisters I ought therefore to give you back the instruction that I have received now that our father cannot afford it you  Mar  Alas could we have known at the time that we were providing masters for him that he would one day have wanted necessaries He has cost us something it is true in his education but I do not regret it the money has been well laid out Valentine is grateful and does his best to give us proofs of it  SCENE V  Martha Jenny Lucy  Lucy  jumping  Here he is here he is  Mar  Who Lucy  Lucy  My father he is just come  SCENE VI  Thorowgood Martha Jenny Lucy  Mar  running to meet him with open arms  Ah my dear friend  Jenny  taking his hand  My dear father  Lucy  How glad I am to see you  Tho  Good morning to you my dear good morning to you children  Mar  Are not you sadly tired with your walk  Tho  No I feel myself quite nimble but my poor Martha you look sorrowful I see you have been weeping  Mar  It it true but do not be uneasy at that for they were tears of pleasure at having such dutiful children If you did but know how much satisfaction they have given me this morning on your account  Tho  These are sweet words to me there is not a greater happiness when we do our own duty than to see it done by those who belong to us As I went to the Squire's this morning my heart filled with your idea now I return home and find my wise and children wholly engrossed by mine What comfort is this  Mar  Will you take any thing Will  you change your dress Jenny has provided every thing for you  Tho  No I thank you there is no occasion the thought of it alone is sufficient refreshment to me    Kissing Jenny    Mar  Well you have seen our landlord how did he receive you  Tho  As I expected he has a feeling and good heart He is a man Martha of the highest honour and humanity  Mar  Indeed did he compassionate our misfortunes Tell me all  Tho  As soon as he was informed of my arrival without making me wait a moment he came out to me and took me into his best parlour  Jenny  Into his best parlour  Tho  Yes Jenny he was drinking coffee with his lady and they ordered a ham on the same table for me and Madam was so good as to cut me a slice  Jenny  What Madam herself  Tho  Yes indeed with her own hands and in so obliging a manner  Mar  Oh the dear lady  Tho  They would not let me speak about business till I had finished my breakfast  Mar  How charming is this and then  Tho  Well then my good Thorowgood said Mr Parks what news Very bad answered I I have lost all my cattle in the space of eight days by a disease brought on by the drought of the season I am ruined and I am come to inform you of it that you may be at liberty to let your farm to another tenant I come also to offer you all that I have left in the world it is a great trouble to me that I have not sufficient to satisfy you but I promise on the word of an honest man to labour night and day till I can do so I shall eat of the bread of bitterness till I have paid my debt to the utmost farthing  Mar  Oh certainly we will do it readily What did Mr Parks say to this  Tho  I was already acquainted with your losses honest Thorowgood said he and am heartily sorry for them I pity you also said Madam with her sweet voice I pity you with all my heart  Mar  The worthy couple how good they are  Tho  I do not come here said I to excite compassion I have no occasion for it as I am able to work My great concern is that I cannot acquit myself of my debt to you I own I feel for my wife and  my young family I who would have shed my blood to preserve them from want You who are rich and without children know not what it is to see those suffer to whom we have given life Ah if you had such children as I have if you loved them with all your soul and were beloved by them as I amIn saying this grief made me hide my face and when I lifted up my eyes again I saw Mr Parks was no longer looking at me he had turned towards his wife their eyes were filled with tears and fixed on each other Pity was not the only sentiment which then affected them I plainly saw that something which more nearly concerned themselves occupied their minds  Mar  And did you not ask them what it was  Tho  I had not the courage but as I continued to talk of my children Mr Parks strove to change the discourse I perceived clearly that some private affliction was the cause of this and therefore hastened to quit the subject and began talking about my corn and reckoning how much it would yield towards paying my rent  Mar  And pray was not Mr Parks very angry when he found it fall so short of that sum  Tho  Quite the contrary he bid me not despair Go home to your wife said the good gentleman I will order my horse and be with you presently when we will settle every thing I have always looked upon you as an honest man therefore I will do nothing in this business without your concurrence  Mar  Is this possible how much do we owe him  Tho  Four hundred and fifty pounds  Mar  Alas alas how shall we be ever able to pay this money  Tho  It is true and yet had we saved our cattle and our crops had answered this year we should have had enough and something over  Mar  But as it is what will become of us  Tho  Why all that we can do now is to collect together our household goods and farming utensils and sell them to pay our landlord we will keep nothing but what is on our backs we can then shew ourselves before him with a clear conscience This is the only course that we can take to avoid misery  Somebody knocks softly at the door  Jenny    going to the door    I think I heard a knock at the door Yes I see some one    She comes back and speaks in a low voice    It is Mr Pinch  Tho  Mr Pinch What does he want with me I wonder we have never had any quarrel  Mar  I shudder with fear We are undone my dear Thorowgood We shall be taken to jail I know the steward some mischief is sure to happen wherever he interferes  Tho  Compose yourself wife we have nothing to fear Take away the children and leave me alone with him  Mar  What do you mean I must stay with you  Tho  No no leave us together knave as he is I am not afraid of him You only vex me by staying go I beg of you  Mar  Since you insist upon it I must obey    She retires taking Jenny and Lucy in her hand The steward meets them by the way and bows the little girls appear frightened and cling to their mother as she goes out    SCENE VII  Steward Thorowgood  Stew  Thorowgood did not I see you on the road to the Squire's just now  Tho  Very likely in fact I am just returned from thence I have been with my landlord to give up to him the state of my affairs  Stew  What without consulting me have you settled matters together  Tho  No not yet  Stew  So much the better I am come to offer my services and to put you in a method to defend yourself against him  Tho  Against him Pray was it not Mr Parks who gave you the place that you hold Do not you serve him  Stew  I allow it therefore I should not chuse to be seen openly in this business my design is to support you secretly I can recommend you a lawyer of this town by whose means you shall be the gainer where you expect to lose you understand me He is one of those we call a shrewd knavish fellow trust to him he'll settle the business for you he is my friend  Tho  A knavish fellow and your friend I should have guessed so Only see the force of sympathy  Stew  You must not take things so literally I mean that he is a man capable of bringing you safe out of your embarrassments and the present juncture is very favourable  to you this year having proved ruinous to the farmers in many places will easily account for your becoming bankrupt  Tho  I shall have nothing to do with your plan Sir but shall pay my landlord my full debt whenever fortune enables me  Stew  You despise the law then though it offers you its assistance  Tho  No I do not despise it but I think a man's conscience should be his just law and if I make a bargain which is not contrary to that I think honour obliges me to stand to it even though the law might discharge me from it  Stew  Take my word for it neither your honour or conscience will suffer in this business it is not your fault that you have had those losses  Tho  How do you know that perhaps I was to blame to purchase so many cattle at once had I bought but the half my loss would not have been so great and I should have had money enough left to pay my rent  Stew  And be it your fault or not the thing is done now And are you aware of what you expose yourself to when you leave all to the discretion of Mr Parks Why he has it in his power to throw you into prison  Tho  And if he has that power why should I seek to take it from him and if he means to treat me with humanity why rob him of that pleasure  Stew  Well suppose he should not prove rigorous he is mortal you know and his heirs may not be so tractable whereas if you follow my advice you may secure yourself from accidents and procure a final acquittance of the debt  Tho  What can your lawyer make my landlord believe that he is paid before he has received his just due  Stew  No but after having made himself acquainted with your affairs he can settle them much to your advantage and put some money in your pocket besides you understand me  Tho  I do not want his assistance for this I can make the matter as clear to my landlord myself he knows very well the misfortunes which have reduced me I cannot now pass for a man of property  Stew  Very true but one ought always to do things by rule Now this lawyer whom I recommend is one of the best in the country in managing a business of this sort besides I mean myself to lend you every assistance in my power  Tho  I cannot imagine what may be your motive for acting in this manner so much against the Squire's interest unless it is because he appears willing to settle my affairs without consulting you and so deprive you of the perquisites of your office  Stew  What perquisites  Tho  Come come we know how most stewards make their fortunes You all love to fish in troubled waters  Stew  Nay you talk at random I only mean to be your friend in this Put your affair into my hands and those of my friend we will settle them I'll answer for it  Tho  I do not doubt it And so Mr Pinch you think I will let you to whom I owe nothing have the fingering of my money in order to defraud my landlord to whom I owe so much besides the many obligations that I have to him for his constant goodness to me  Stew  Why you will not be the less his debtor for this all your effects are not sufficient to clear your account with him Now if you take my advice you may preserve a part and all that you earn hereafter will be your own  Tho  I cannot see the thing in this light I am determined to give up all that I have  to my landlord and whatever I can save hereafter I will lay by to pay the remainder of my debt to him  Stew  Is it your design then to exhaust your strength by labour without reaping the profit Do you mean to pass your whole life in working for others  Tho  with emotion  You do not know the pleasure which a man has in being satisfied with himself With what tears of joy shall I from time to time carry to Mr Parks the fruits of my industry What happiness shall I experience in having it in my power to prove my gratitude and to convince him that he was not deceived when he took me for an honest man and that when I lost my little fortune I did not lose my probity also  Stew  Ah Thorowgood Thorowgood I see you do not know your own interest  Tho  You mean that I do not promote yours Do you think that I am to be made thus the dupe to your avarice You want to draw me into a knavish act in order to reap the profit of it yourself Why do you not go to my landlord and offer him your services against me It is because you know he has too much goodness to seek my ruin and yet you thought that I might be ungrateful enough to deprive him of his just  due No Mr Pinch you may if you please forget your obligations to him for my part I shall remember mine as long as I live I have had no occasion for you hitherto and I think I shall be able to do without you in future Go then and seek clients elsewhere for your roguish friends  Stew  What do you dare to abuse me Do you know that I can soon or late make you feel my vengeance  Tho  You ought rather to dread mine if I were to lay your secret practices open to Mr Parks  Stew  Oh good Thorowgood let me entreat you  Tho  Be gone for a poltroon as you are I am as incapable of using my advantage over you as of taking your advice  Steward retires in confusion  SCENE VIII  Thorowgood  These are the men who ought to promote peace in the country and they often seek to sow divisions It is such as these who are the ruin of the peasants by plunging them into lawsuits instead of acting as a mediator between the rich and poor their only aim is to estrange them from each other  Where is the gentleman who would not have a pleasure in treating his tenants with humanity if he did but know that in return he was regarded as a friend and father Oh Mr Parks be you such to me it is more than my own destiny that I give into your hands it is that of my wife and children also  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Thorowgood Martha  Tho  No I tell you Martha we have nothing to fear from the steward I can assure you he is more afraid of me at this very instant than ever I shall be of him  Mar  Well I believe you would not deceive me unless it be to quiet my uneasiness  Tho  Be satisfied then I have some good news for you I thought that Humphries had lost all his cattle as well as I but upon casting my eye over our garden I saw on the other side the hedge four fine cows grazing in the meadow below  Mar  But what then  Tho  You must know there is a bargain between us which gives me a right to two of those beasts  Mar  How is that  Tho  I will tell you when the disease first broke out amongst our cattle I saw Humphries was quite cast down by it as I had always hitherto been more fortunate than he I offered to do all in my power to serve him He thanked me in so affecting a manner that I wished to give him some proof of my good will to him upon the spot You must know just before the disorder appeared we had made a joint purchase of twelve cows at a neighbouring fair It is true I advanced twothirds of the money but upon his consenting to graze them for a certain time on his farm which was an excellent bargain for him in point of money as we settled it I told him that whatever of the herd should escape the mortality we would divide equally between us At that time I had no reason to think that this arrangement would turn out in my favour and now though it has I should be far from taking advantage of it if it regarded myself alone but I am no longer master of my own I am obliged to give up all my remaining  property to my landlord I should therefore think myself guilty of a theft if I did not on this account lay claim to every thing due to me  Mar  And have you seen Humphries since our losses  Tho  No but I just now sent our son George through the garden gate after him See he is come back already  SCENE II  Thorowgood Martha George  Tho  Well son what does Humphries say  Geo  That he does not know what I am talking about nor what you have to do with his cows  Tho  surprized  You certainly must have made some mistake in your message  Geo  No no father I told him the whole matter clearly as you ordered me and he understood me so well that he repeated word for word with the steward who was with him on a visit besides he is coming to speak to you himself  Tho  That is well we shall settle matters at the first word Humphries knows as well as I do what we promised each other  Mar  Have you any written agreement between you  Tho  I do not want it wife Can one wish better security than a man's word When that fails there is an end of all integrity  Mar  You imagine all the world like yourself but ah my good friend when interest is in the case  Tho  What do you mean I will never believe my neighbour capable of such villainy I have always looked upon him as an honest man but here he comes you will see every thing will be explained  To George  You may return to your work George I do not want you  Geo  Very well father  SCENE III  Thorowgood Martha Humphries  Tho  I am glad you are come Humpries I'll lay a wager George has made some confusion between us  Hum  Indeed I believe so I was not able to comprehend a word of what he said to me He told me that you had sent him to fetch my cows  Tho  No I ordered him to demand mine of you  Hum  Your cows  Tho  Yes those that I saw in the meadow Have not you saved four  Hum  Without doubt But how came they to be yours  Tho  Two of those belong to me Did not we pass our words to each other to divide between us amicably whatever should be left after the disease  Hum  in confusion  But Thorowgood  Tho  No evasions Humphries tell me plainly was not this agreed between us  Hum  I cannot deny it neighbour but one says many things that one does not always stand to Do but consider my situation to have so fine a herd of cattle as I had and to save but four of them  Tho  I am much more to be pitied for being under the necessity of asking them of you When we made the bargain which of us was most likely to be the gainer by it Had not I the greatest number of cows Did not I agree to it out of kindness to you and did not you yourself look upon it in that light  Hum  To be sure neighbour but after so great a loss  Tho  I see then the extent of your integrity  You are one of those honest men who can walk uprightly as long as prosperity holds but stumble at the first step if fortune change ever so little I find my wife knew you better than I did and I plainly see that we must not depend too much on the rectitude of others  Hum  But Mr Pinch assures me that the law does not bind me to the bargain  Tho  I have nothing farther to say to you if you consult the chicane of the law before your conscience I was once your friend and that restrains me from publicly exposing your dishonesty Go I give you up your cattle I should never have claimed them for myself alone it was on Mr Park's account but I must work a year the longer for him you may go I acquit you of your promise  Hum  in a despairing accent  Ah Thorowgood you stab me to the heart  SCENE IV  Thorowgood Martha  Tho  hiding his face between his hands  I could never have expected this from a man whom I looked upon as one of my best friends  Mar  Come cheer up my good man it is now my turn to be the comforter  Tho  Ah Martha I can bear up against the losses of fortune but not against those of friendship  Mar  Be comforted we shall find friends I will answer for it more to be depended on See here comes Robert our rich neighbour perhaps he has something to propose for our good  SCENE V  Thorowgood Martha Meadows  Mead  Good morrow Thorowgood well how goes it  Tho  Bad enough truly neighbour you know I suppose that I am ruined  Mead  Yes I have just been told of it and this is the reason why I am come to see you  Tho  I am now worth nothing  Mead  How so have you not a fine field of wheat of which you may make many a good pound If you mean to sell it I am your man I will buy it as it is and pay the money down what say you  Tho  If you have a mind to it so much the better my landlord will be here this morning and you may settle the matter with him I will not interfere in your bargain  Mead  I have nothing to do with Mr Parks the wheat is yours  Tho  It did indeed belong to me a few days ago but it is not mine now  Mead  with surprize  How have you sold it to him then  Tho  No but since my losses being no longer in a condition to pay I have given him up all that I possess  Mead  Are you mad Thorowgood why you have the law on your side till your grain is made over to your landlord by some security it belongs to you and you may do what you please with it Come come you have lost too much already ask Martha what she thinks of the matter  Mar  Why I think that we ought in the first place to pay our debts at any rate if we have lost our cattle our landlord has not gained by it the loss therefore is our affair not his  Mead  But you must not carry this so far as to deprive yourself of bread You ought to keep something in reserve to be above want  Tho  looking severely at him  What at the expence of our good landlord  Mead  But he is so rich When you have given up all to him it will be no more in  his pocket than a crownpiece would be to you  Tho  Why I believe he could do without it but that is no reason that I should take it from him  Mar  But do not you know what a generous and compassionate man he is  Tho  For this very reason I ought to be the more fair in my dealings with him  Mar  What would you have us use him ill because he treats others well  Tho  Fye fye neighbour it would be infamous  Mead  Come come do not be so stiff take my advice it depends all on the manner in which we see things There is no doubt but your landlord would do you a kindness but to make that matter sure do one to yourself Do you want to be one amongst the number of the poor that he relieves  Tho  He will not have that pleasure long if all his tenants take your advice  Mead  You are an obstinate man and I lose my time talking to you I have but one word more to say Will you sell me your wheat yes or no  Tho  with a smile of contempt  Ha I understood now what you would be at and  why you interest yourself so much in my affairs Hark ye you are a rich fellow and this would be a convenient bargain to you but I have a better scheme than this to propose to you  Mead  Now you speak reason let us hear  Tho  I expect my landlord here every minute he always carries about him a wellfurnished purse a gold watch and some rings of value Suppose you and I wait for him at the corner of the grove and rob him of them it would be no bad adventure this  Mead  starting back  What do you mean Thorowgood  Tho  Why he is so rich the loss to him will be no more than a crown would be to us  Mead  Aye but the gallows  Tho  Aye that alone restrains you but if I were to judge you Meadows I would let you see that you do not deserve it the less for what you have just now proposed to me I see no difference for my part between robbing a man of his money or robbing him of the fruits of his land  Mead  Oh there is a great difference in the two cases  Tho  There may be so but if you will reflect a little I am of opinion you will think as I do  Mead  I do not desire it indeed there is little to be got by this way of reasoning Come come Thorowgood consider your own interest a little better your landlord will have great obligations to you to be sure when you have reduced yourself to want on his account he will only despise you and treat you the worse for it  Tho  If his heart were like yours I should have reason to fear this  Mead  And pray what harm have I done you but you are an obstinate man I wish to preserve your family from want it is you that are the hardhearted man and will be guilty of all their sufferings and perhaps their death I only desire to give you your own price for your wheat that is if you are reasonable and here is the money  Tho  seizing him by the arm  Meadows I have lost in eight days all that I am worth and am reduced to the last farthing but if ever I am guilty of a dishonest action even to supply my most urgent necessities  pulling off his hat  may Heaven strike me dead with its thunder  Mead  with a smile of contempt  Very well No matter what becomes of your wife and children leave them to beg their bread whilst you enjoy on your dunghill the pleasure of  hearing yourself calledthe worthy Thorowgood the honest man  Tho  And that is what you will never hear said of yourself Thou wretch thou hast more money than thou knowest what to do with and yet in your eagerness to amass more you want to cheat others and to make me a knave like yourself  He takes him by the shoulders  Get out of my house this instant before I knock you down  Turns him out  SCENE VI  Martha Thorowgood  Tho  I never in my life saw a more impudent rogue He knows how much I abhor all sort of dishonesty and yet he comes seriously to propose a downright robbery to me he would not have done this when my affairs were in a better state Poverty is indeed terrible when it exposes us to such affronts as these O Martha never let us be shaken by the miseries of our situation the poorer we are the more rigid must be our integrity  Mar  Otherwise it will be thought that we were only respected for our riches  Tho  This is my comfort in the midst of my troubles Let us not attend Martha to  what others say we have occasion only for ourselves  A noise at the door  Who knocks Cannot I have a moment's peace  SCENE VII  Thorowgood Martha Hearty  Hearty  Good morrow good folks  Tho  going hastily up to him  What do you want farmer are you come to propose some piece of knavery to me  Hear  calmly  I Thorowgood Did you ever hear any thing of that kind from me  Tho  throwing himself into his arms  No never never forgive me it was the remains of my indignation which transported me Did you know what has happened to me within this hour you would excuse me for distrusting all mankind The servant of my landlord wants me to commit a fraud my friend has repaid my kindness with ingratitude and the richest man in the village would barter my honesty for a trifling gain  Hear  Think no more of these wretches if they choose to make a trade of doing ill you are too good to disturb yourself about them Hear me I have but two words to say I know that it is not in your power to  pay Squire Parks it is at present impossible for me to advance the sum that you want but try to obtain time of your landlord I will be answerable for it he shall have my security  Mar  to Thorowgood who seems immoveable with surprise  See husband what goodness  To Hearty  O my dear neighbour how came you by so saving a thought for us  Hear  It was a very natural one I said to myself the kind hearted Thorowgood was always ready to the utmost of his power to give his assistance to others it would be hard indeed if he should find no one in his turn to assist him and I therefore am come  Mar  apart  It seems as if Heaven had sent him to our succour  Hear  Why Thorowgood art thou dumb  holding out his hand  Tho  seizing him by the hand and pressing it between his  Ah my dear friend Hearty I am not silent from insensibility I feel your kindness at the bottom of my heart but I cannot accept it  Hear  And why not it will not be useless to you However well Mr Parks may be disposed towards you he will be still better pleased when he has my security for your debt  Tho  But who will be my security to you  Hear  Your own probity industry and ingenuity  Tho  And yet you see to what I am reduced one bad year has ruined me a second of the same sort may add your ruin to mine  Hear  No matter I will run the risque  Tho  But I will not suffer it it is enough that my family suffers by me without seeing my friends do so also I should never more enjoy a moment's peace Every fog every cloud the least storm of wind would cast terror into my heart  Hear  with urgency  My dear Thorowgood if you did but know how much you afflict me by your refusal Will you then let me do nothing for you  Tho  You have done enough in thus comforting my afflicted heart it is torn to pieces but the tears which I now see in your eyes are as balm to its wounds O my good friend though it is a sad thing to become an object of pity yet there is a wide difference between being pitied and being ill spoken of Thanks be to heaven you will never have cause to regret having known me In whatever place we meet I shall never have occasion to draw my hat over my face or turn aside my head to avoid the shame of blushing in your presence  Hear  The more you resist the more my friendship increases and you are so cruel you will not give me yours in return  Tho  Think well of it I beseech you I know your slender means Should I be your friend were I to plunge you into difficulties in order to draw myself out of them No no my good neighbour I am as yet guilty of the ruin of no one and it shall never be said that I will become so As long as I live I will sleep with a clear conscience It is this which converts the mat of straw into a bed of down  Hear  I will press you no more I feel that I am not worthy to put an end to your troubles Providence no doubt reserves that for itself All I ask is that you will depend on me next to Providence and my hands and my little fortune you shall always find at your service Farewell  He goes out Thorowgood conducts him to the door pressing his hand  SCENE VIII  Thorowgood Martha  Tho  I have a friend then my dear Martha I rejoice however that he has left me I might perhaps have yielded to his entreaties  from the fear of afflicting him We are delivered then from a great temptation but we must prevent his return Come my wife we must act with spirit let us assemble together all our effects against Squire Parks's coming I would not have him think that we had deliberated for a moment in doing our duty  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  Household furniture appears dispersed in different parts of the room and a heap of clothes and linen on a large table  SCENE I  Thorowgood Martha  Tho  Come courage Martha keep up your spirits till we have finished our business  Mar  I believe it is now all done  Tho  How is this all that we have to give to our landlord I never wished so much to have our little stock of necessaries in good  order about us as I do at the instant that I am going to be deprived of them Have you searched in every corner  Mar  Yes my dear I turned over every drawer in the cupboard  Tho  taking breath  I feel myself the lighter for all this these things were like a load on my heart which almost stifled it  Mar  You must be sadly fatigued you had better take a draught of beer to refresh you  Tho  Put some for us both into this cup  He takes a silver tankard off the table  Mar  having filled it with beer  What is the matter with you your hand trembles  Tho  Nothing at all but it is so many years since this piece of plate has been in our family  Mar  It does not go out of it now however in a bad cause  Tho  My grandfather bequeathed it to his eldest grandson but I alas shall not be able to leave it to mine  Mar  Your last blessing will be the more pure for this  Tho  Yes I shall have that consolation  After drinking he shews the tankard to his wife  See here the first letter of your name which I had engraved with mine  Mar  Well my dear this cypher is no reproach to us we ourselves have been yet more united  Tho  And we will be so always though this were the last time that we should drink together Here my dear wife  he gives the tankard to Martha and whilst she lifts it to her mouth with a sigh  come we must now put all these things in order let us begin with my wedding suit  He takes it off the table and displays it looking at it attentively  How happy I was Martha the first time I put this on when I took you to church and how often has the sight of it brought back to my mind agreeable remembrances I never opened that cupboard without looking at it and I never looked at it without thinking with pleasure on the day of our marriage it gives me pleasure now for another reason  Mar  For what my dear  Tho  For having preserved it so well that it will help a little towards paying our debts see it is in very good condition yet they do not wear these great sleeves and large plaits now they did not spare stuff at that time of day and I am glad of it why here is almost enough to make two such as are worn now  Mar  Here is mine also let us put them  together and I shall beg of our landlord to let them both be sold at the same time it would grieve me to have them separated  Tho  Do not be so superstitious suppose they were my dear what then would our hearts be divided by that  Mar  No Thorowgood I have no fear of that it is not superstition my dear husband it is a I don't know what to call it but I should rather they were to remain together  Tho  Come come make yourself easy Mr Parks will I dare say indulge this little weakness of yours  He lays his hand on a little bundle neatly wrapped in a linen cloth  What bundle is this  Mar  It is Valentine's you know it is the linen and jewels which we found with him in his cradle look at them they seem to be of great value  Tho  perceiving that Martha begins to undo the bundle stops her  Hold Martha we have no right to this nor has our landlord any claim to it it belongs to Valentine if he were our son the case would be different put it back into the box we will speak to Mr Parks about it  Mar  Provided he will take our words  Tho  I have no fear of that he is just  and sensible and when I relate the circumstance to him he will be of our opinion  SCENE II  Thorowgood Martha Lucy  Lucy  bringing in a bundle of clothes in her arms  Here father here are my Sunday clothes and these are Jenny's shall I put them on the table  Tho  Yes child by those of your father and mother  Mar  with tears in her eyes  Oh my poor children how sorry I am for you  Tho  No Martha we ought to rejoice not grieve for them now Should we weep for their being good children  embracing Lucy tenderly  Tell me would you wish to keep these clothes  Lucy  Certainly if you could keep yours too but since you are obliged to give yours to our landlord I will also do the same Do not you owe him all you have  Tho  All my child  Lucy  I am sure I had rather always go in a ragged frock than that people should say see how flaunting Lucy is dressed but it is at other people's expence  Tho  Right my dear child this is thinking  as you ought preserve these sentiments and you will never be unhappy nor will your courage ever be cast down  Mar  Your father is in the right never fear we will work night and day before you and your sister shall want  Lucy  And we in our turns will do our best that you shall not want  Tho  In thus assisting each other I hope we shall be able to bring ourselves out of this unfortunate situation but should we not we shall at least have nothing to reproach ourselves with no man on earth will dare to despise us or look down upon you When we are dead they may tell you it is true that your parents were poor but never that they were dishonest You need not blush when you shed tears over their graves no one will push you back whilst they trample on them with indignation before your face  Lucy  I will go and see father if I have forgotten nothing When Jenny has done we shall have something else to bring you  SCENE III  Thorowgood Martha  Tho  Why Martha what still cast down Shall our children be more courageous than we We possess all their love but do not  let us lessen it by giving them cause to esteem us less They know that it is not our bad conduct which has brought these misfortunes upon us but if we suffer ourselves to be overcome by a weak despair we shall appear faulty to them Come let us think no more of our troubles than as they have given us occasion to feel the comfort which our children have given us  Mar  Yes my dear it is the sweetest that a mother can feel Could I ever have expected to see them so sensible and good at so early an age  Tho  And why not Martha Could I ever doubt that a woman like thee would not bring my children up as worthy as herself They will be the staff of our old age when decrepit with years we may rest assuredly upon them But I hear Valentine's voice I have something important to say to himMartha shall I beg of thee to leave me alone with him a little  Mar  Why do you ask it Am not I as much concerned as you in every thing that regards him Do you believe that he is less dear to me than to you  Tho  It is for this reason that I wish you to be away just now it is your tenderness for him that I dread  Mar  You make me tremble what can this secret be Is it any misfortune that has befallen him  Tho  No my dear on the contrary it is concerning his good fortune that I am now going to speak to him  Mar  And are you afraid that I should be witness to this  Tho  Well then stay if you will but you must promise me not to contradict what I shall say if you love him and wish his good you must acquiesce in whatever I propose to him  Mar  But why did not you before entrust me with your designs  Tho  Here he comes you shall hear them in his presence  SCENE IV  Thorowgood Martha Valentine  Valen  Good morrow father I am come to see if you are returned safe  Tho  Yes son as you see  Valen  And how were you received by the Squire  Tho  As well as I could wish he is not one of those haughty and unfeeling men who will scarcely allow us poor people to be their  fellow creatures He will come here presently and you see what I have prepared to give up to him towards my debt  Valen  What do you mean to strip yourself in one moment of all that you have earned by hard labour  Tho  This is not the greatest sacrifice that I must make today I must endure a loss which will go much nearer to my heart  Valen  What have you to lose more  Tho  Alas it is thyself Valentine thee whom I have ever loved so tenderly  Valen  Me father  Mar  with emotion  What do you say  Tho  Since the word has passed my lips I must repeat it yes my child we must part  Valen  But why do you drive me from your presence Have I given you any cause of complaint  Mar  Oh never never you know it too Thorowgood no son was ever more submissive or more tender towards his parents  Tho  And I Martha am as ready as you to declare this Yes Valentine you have done for us a hundred times more than we had a right to expect I love you with all the tenderness of a real father but nevertheless you know that I am not yours  Had we continued in prosperity you should have always been our son our dear son all my other children believe you to be their brother I meant after my death that you should have shared with them the little substance which you have daily helped me to increase This hope was a comfort to my heart but it is destroyed nothing now is left us not even the distant prospect of a reestablishment  Valen  And is this the moment which you have chosen to cast me from amongst the number of your children  Tho  Yes I ought to do so the ties of blood bind them to our lot whatever it be if we suffer they ought to suffer with us but you what right have I to involve you in my distress No Valentine I advise you as a friend and if it must be I command you as a father to quit an unfortunate family It is time that you should do something for yourself since it is no longer in my power to give you a fortune I rejoice that I have had you so well instructed as to enable you to gain one  Valen  You must not remind me of these obligations if you wish to have me abandon you I must first forget them myself you saved my life in my infancy your wife  nourished me with her milk you have bred me up and educated me without expecting any recompence and you command me to be ungrateful for all these benefits  Tho  I have only acquitted myself to you as one man ought to another Should not I have been a monster had I left you to perish  Valen  And yet you would have me prove myself one by withdrawing from you my assistance when you most want it  Tho  You know me Valentine you know that I should be ashamed to live at the expence of another  Valen  My life then to this moment has been a very shameful one have not I hitherto subsisted by you alone  Tho  But have not you sufficiently repaid me by your labour  Valen  My hands it is true have repaid what your hands have done for me but my heart has not yet repaid your love O my father recall to your remembrance the first days of my infancy when I was as a stranger in your family How many times have you pressed me in your arms at your return from hard labour which you had prolonged in order to support me And you my dear mother can you forget the many tender caresses that you have lavished on me  at the very time when I was eating the bread of your children You alone received me when abandoned by all the world and shall I now abandon you I was your son to inherit your fortune and shall I not be so to share your poverty Alas how much you must have despised me before you could believe me capable of this  Martha attempts to speak but her voice is stifled by her sighs  Tho  Despise you Valentine No my son I esteem you the more for these sentiments but I say again it is time that you should think of doing something for yourself  Valen  No I think only of you I will burden myself with your labours I will afflict myself with your griefs my head my hands all that I have all that I am I give you I devote myself entirely to you whether you go or remain I will never quit you you may fly me but you shall not hinder my following you When you hear me groaning the whole night stretched at the door of your cottage you will surely open it to me  Tho  Perhaps I may no longer have one  Valen  Then I will follow you to the wild  common or the bleak dreary mountain wherever you go I will be with you  Mar  to Thorowgoodexclaiming with sobs  You hear him Thorowgood  Valen  springing eagerly towards her  Ah I knew it well my dear mother I knew that you would not drive me from your heart  Tho  melting into tears  Come to my arms my son my dear son it is I now who entreat thee never more to quit us  Valen  Never never my father without relations without friends on whom could my heart repose I have no one on earth but you to love I feel that you are a thousand times more dear to me since you have lost your all I have hitherto only given you the sweat of my brow but my blood is ready to be shed for you O my father since you no longer urge me to quit you you must press me the more closely in your arms  SCENE V  Thorowgood Martha Humphries  Hum  comes in at the close of last scene advances hastily to Thorowgood  And I Thorowgood wilt thou repulse me  Tho  looking upon him with indignation  What dost thou here wretch Is it not  enough to have betrayed me Must you also disturb by your presence the joy which this moment affords me  Hum  Do not oppress me more I suffer already too cruelly by a bitter repentance you may either bring me back to the paths of honour or expose me as the most unworthy of men to the eyes of others as well as my own  Tho  What then would you have with me  Hum  Give me back your friendship Think not Thorowgood that I was so base as to renounce it for a paltry gain but you know what losses I have suffered The fear of seeing my children want had blinded me but it was using them very ill I already feel that I shall love them less after having been guilty of so black an action Deliver me from my shame give me back my own esteem though at the price of my blood give me back my friend  Tho  Ah Humphries how difficult is it to cure the wound which thou hast made Nevertheless I am touched with your speedy return to virtue and forget your offence  Hum  Make me forget it then myself and receive that which was the cause of it  Tho  What do you propose Shall I put a price on our reconciliation No Humphries  keep what belongs to you if you wish my friendship  Hum  I will not accept it if you refuse me have you not advantages enough over me without this You have no other way of being generous to me Do not let me have before my eyes what will be a constant reproach to my heart  Tho  If it be so I accept your offer but you must promise me that on the first return of good fortune I shall be at liberty to satisfy myself in my turn  Hum  I have no will but yours from henceforward let our losses and gains be in common between us  Tho  You have recovered my good opinion  He takes his hand  Come Martha whatever misfortunes may happen to me in the course of this day I shall always find cause for consolation since I have preserved a son and found a lost friend  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  Jenny  Jenny  runs across the room to the door of the next apartment  O Father O Mother Come come quickly  SCENE II  Jenny Martha Thorowgood  Mar  first enters  Well what is the matter child why do you make this outcry  Jenny  There is a grand coach just now stopped at the door with four beautiful horses and a number of fine folks all bedizened with lace both before and behind and a gentleman in it O mother what a sweet countenance he hasHow do you do m  dear he said to me smilingWhere is your father and mother  To Thorowgood  He wants to speak to you  Tho  hastily  Odd so I'll lay my life it is our landlord I must run to receive him  He hurries out  SCENE III  Martha Jenny  Jenny  looking sorrowfully  What this is the gentleman then to whom as my father said all that we have belongs  Mar  Yes my child we owe him a great deal of money and as we have not half enough to discharge our debt we are willing to do as much as we can and give him up all our remaining property  Jenny  And what can he do with it he has too fine a carriage to make use of our cart and he is too well dressed to wear such clothes as we have  Mar  That is very true but he will sell them and take the money we have no other way of paying and even that will not be sufficient  Jenny  Do you think that he will be so wicked as to treat us in such a cruel manner if you had seen how goodnatured he looked upon me  Mar  There is no wickedness in all that Jenny it is no more than justice  Jenny  It is a sad thing howeverlet me take a last look at my holiday clothes Could  you have thought mother last spring when you gave me this jacket and petticoat that I should wear them only two or three times It was but last Sunday that I felt such pleasure at being so smartly dressed and you yourself mother were so happy to see it  She takes her mother's hand on perceiving her concern  Come don't grieve I do not mind my fine clothes we worked to get them and we will work to have others But here is the gentleman coming I will go look for my sister in the garden  SCENE IV  Martha in the frontin the back part Mr Parks who is coming in with Thorowgood whilst Jenny is going out  When Jenny gets to the door she meets Mr Parks she curtsies slightly making way at the same time and then proceeds  Mr Parks  Well where are you going my dear are you afraid of me  Jenny  half turned towards him  Oh no Sir no one can be afraid of you that looks in your face excuse me a moment I shall be back directly  SCENE V  Martha in the forepart Mr Parks and Thorowgood behind  Mr Parks  to Thorowgood  What a sprightly countenance that little girl has  Tho  Aye and her sister too I'll warrant her they are both of them as lively girls as you would wish to see  Mr Parks  Seeing Martha approach salutes her  Ah Martha how goes it  Mar  As the times are Sir but very so so I hope you are well Sir  Mr Parks  Perfectly well thank God I have a thousand things to say from my wife do you know that she had a great inclination to come with me  Tho  And she would not have done amiss our country air is much better than your close air in town  Seeing Mr Parks hold his hat in his hand  But Sir I hope you use no ceremony here pray be covered You are at home in your tenant's house  Mr Parks smiles and shews him his silk hat only to be worn under the arm  You see it would not go on my head it is the custom to appear with such hats as these in town upon some occasions  Tho  It is rightly said what is the custom in town is not so in the country  Aside  But it is odd enough to use hats that will not go on one's head  SCENE VI  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha and two Servants  First Serv  who with the other is carrying in a large covered basket  Where would you have this laid Sir  Mr Parks  There in the corner that will do desire the coachman to take the horses to the best inn and put up the carriage  Second Serv  Have you any other orders to give the servants  Mr Parks  Tell them to order a good dinner for themselves I mean to treat them today but let them avoid drinking to excess I shall not return to town before the evening you must be ready at six  Second Serv  Very well Sir  SCENE VII  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha  Mr Parks  You see Thorowgood we  shall have full time to talk together but first I should be glad to see all your family Where are your children  Tho  All at work my sons in the field and my daughters in the garden But will you come and look at your corn fields  Mr Parks  Not now in the evening when the heat of the day is over  Tho  They look finely there is to the value of a hundred pounds if there be a shilling  Mr Parks  Well so much the better  He looks round the room  But what does all this mean one would imagine that you were going to have an auction here Why all this linen and furniture piled up in this manner  Tho  It is because we expected your coming Sir  Mr Parks  And what then  Tho  I told you this morning that we should not be able to pay our rent it is therefore our duty to give you up what we have and you see it collected here With the sale of our furniture clothes and corn we mean to pay you as far as we can Whatever may be deficient we will endeavour to earn by our labour till we have paid to a farthing I hope Sir you will at present be  satisfied with this on account and have a little patience for the rest  Mar  As you have always been so indulgent to usand indeed it is not by any fault of ours that we are in this distress  Tho  You know as well as myself Sir that I had drained the marshes in order to make them fit for pasture and they were in a thriving way All the money that we had remaining last year we laid out in cattle in order to fatten them for sale Twenty head of good cattle was a little fortune which promised fair to pay our rent by sending a few of them off to market A drought came on there was scarcely a blade of grass in my fields I fed my cattle with the straw of my bed the thatch of my barn and sometimes with the vegetables that were for my family's use When I wanted to get rid of them I could find no purchaser owing to the scarcity of fodder A murrain got amongst them and I lost them all I owe nothing however to any body but to you Sir Come and look at your grounds you will see whether I have neglected to cultivate them you will see if my own labour with that of my wife and children may not enable me one day to pay all my debts I can however give you no other security  than my own word but as I have always been punctual till now in my engagements with you I should hope that you would have some reliance on my promise  Mr Parks  Yes my friends I do know you Why should I not be content with the promise of such honest worthy people as you are  Tho  I give you thanks Sir your kind words are still more pleasing than your goodness itself How seldom will a creditor give the character of an honest man to the debtor by whom he has lost  Mr Parks  How seldom also does it happen my friend Thorowgood that a creditor can with truth say that the debtor by whom he has suffered is worthy of that appellation  SCENE VIII  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha  Jenny carrying with both hands a large cage with chickens and Lucy with a basket of eggs in one hand and holding up with her other the corners of her apron in which are some handfuls of halfpence  Jenny sets down the cage at the feet of Mr Parks and Lucy her basket also she then takes Thorowgood's hat and pouring into it  the money that she has in her apron presents it to Mr Parks  Lucy  Here Sir here is all that we have our chickens our eggs and our money we have nothing else in the world have we Jenny  Jenny  No indeed Sir nothing more  Tho  looking at the hat over Mr Parks's shoulder  What so much money how came you by it  Lucy  With my sister's chickens my eggs and flowers which my mother sold for us in town  Jenny  These were our first savings as a beginning towards our support but we part with all freely for your sake  Lucy  That we do with all our hearts  Tho  with joy  And I receive it with all my heart No money ever gave me so much pleasure Come Sir this is so much paid  To his children  How happy I am my dear girls to see that you have the same sentiments with your father  Mar  What then is it from your own suggestions alone that you have done this  Jenny  As my father himself is not able to pay it is but right to help him all in our power  Mr Parks  Oh Thorowgood what exquisite  happiness you must feel under your afflictions The tenderness of your children is more than a compensation for all your losses  To Jenny and Lucy  No my dear girls I will not strip you of your first riches Take back what you have so nobly offered me I have no accounts to settle but with your father  Tho  Give them their own way they feel no concern in parting with these things  Mr Parks  And do you feel none at seeing them lose their little fortune  Tho  How Sir There is nothing more natural and pleasing than to receive assistance from our children Were I as rich as a king all my possessions should be theirs when I have nothing whatever they possess is mine  To his children  Won't you be always glad to pay for us  Jenny  pressing both his hands  Ah father can you doubt it  Lucy  I wish we had a hundred times more we would give it all with the same pleasure  Tho  You hear what they say Sir  Mr Parks  And I would not receive it were it a thousand times more considerable  To Lucy  Here my dear good little girl take back your treasure pray do  He attempts to pour the money into Lucy's apron she  declines it at length after many entreaties she pretends to yield and takes the hat but places it on the table beside the rest of the effects and says to him as she retires  You will find it there with the other things  Mr Parks  turning towards her  What are you about hold hold  Lucy  I will not even listen to you Come Jenny  Both go off skipping and dancing  SCENE IX  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha  Tho  pushing the cage and basket under the table  I told you that they were shrewd lasses they are not so easily caught  Mr Parks  But what Thorowgood do you really mean to make them pay for you  Tho  Why not Sir it is very natural  Mr Parks  Methinks you are little acquainted with the manners of the town  Tho  It is enough for me to know that I act right whether in town or country no matter Justice and duty are to me one and the same thing Is not this the practice where you live  Mr Parks  It is precisely the reverse on most occasions  Tho  Do you tell me so Sir  Mrs Parks  Yes my friend you are surprized yet it is too true When by folly and extravagance ambitious and destructive schemes people have put it out of their power to pay their debts they transfer to their children the property which they may have obtained from the credulity and confidence of their creditors and when the latter apply for payment the parents possess nothing and all that they seemed to have is found in the hands of their children who will not part with it  Tho  with indignation  What abominable knavery  Mar  It is horrible  Tho  And do the laws take no notice of these tricks  Mr Parks  Art and cunning find a way to silence them  Tho  Your laws are as corrupt as those who stifle their voice if they will not speak out on such occasions Hear me Sir I am entirely ignorant of law proceedings but I would not hesitate to say openly to that justice which would submit to that restriction Thou hast no farther business upon earth be gone then to hell where the wicked shall at last meet with due punishment Were I the dupe of the father I would go to the  children and ask them by what right they retained the property which ought to be restored to me If they should tell me that they received it from their parents my answer would be your parents could not bestow it on you it belongs to me I would compel them without mercy to sell the bed from under them in order to satisfy me  Mr Parks  Matters are not carried on in that manner with us  Tho  I would have them carried on in my way such fathers and such children are no better than a knot of thieves  Mr Parks  The fathers are the most criminal  Tho  No Sir begging your pardon the latter are still more so the former are knaves but the others are monsters When a stranger hath relieved us in our distress are we not in duty bound whilst we have a drop of generous blood in our veins to relieve him in turn if he should want our assistance and children who owe every thing to their parents have cost them so much anxiety care and toil shall they not act in the same manner I shudder at the bare thought of such a thing were I to see my father incapable of paying what he owed though he had not left me a penny I should  still think myself bound to fulfil all his engagements I should consider it as a duty of inheritance in me to acquit his memory and preserve the integrity of his name Though I were to live upon bread alone to the last hour of my life and be obliged to work the flesh from my bones I would endeavour to pay all his debts and when I had done so I would go to his grave and address him thus Father now rest in peace thou owest nothing  Mr Parks  Thou art a noble fellow Thorowgood  Tho  Yes Sir I would do soGracious heaven can we honor with the name of children those unnatural beings who rather than deprive themselves of some few comforts of life would suffer their fathers to be treated like knaves Without being one of their unfortunate creditors I could curse such monsters of children  SCENE X  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha Lucy  Lucy  at the threshold of the door  Father Humphries's cows are come would you have them brought in  Tho  Do you consider what you say I'll  go and look at them excuse me for a moment Sir This matter concerns you they are like wise your property I will tell you presently how I came by them  as he retires  Thanks be to Heaven blessings are flowing in on all sides today  Goes out with Lucy who would not venture in for fear Mr Parks should press her to take back her money  SCENE XI  Mr Parks Martha  Mr Parks  Your husband really astonishes me Martha I was very sensible indeed that he was full of honour and probity but to find him possess such elevated sentiments in the very depth of distress is what I must own I did not expect  Mar  I have always seen him behave in the same manner Sir as you do now in all transactions his first object is to find out the side of justice and when he has found it he adheres to it and will support it with all and against all beginning by himself However he is no more than what he ought to be  Mr Parks  True but then in the situation to which he is reduced not to hesitate a moment  Mar  Oh Sir you know but little of him  he would see us all without a morsel of bread rather than have the least cause of reproach to himself and that without appearing any way disturbed He is never cast down he is less the sport of Fortune than his fortune is of him  Mr Parks  You must love him dearly Martha  Mar  Love him Ah Sir can you doubt it What would have become of me but for the comfort that he affords me I am always happy when I see him with a cheerful countenance I cannot imagine I have any wants as long as Heaven vouchsafes to preserve him to me He is indeed my all upon earth  SCENE XII  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha  Tho  I give you joy Sir two of the finest cows in the whole country Oh let me alone I will go tomorrow yes I will go myself to market They will fetch ten pounds a piece the least penny they sha'n't go for a farthing less not to a prince You may reckon upon so much this will reduce our account so much We will settle it if you please My debts hang like a mountain on my shoulders I long to be eased of the heavy burden  Mr Parks  I wish it as much as you can my friend  Tho  You know what I remain in your debt for the rest of my rent  Mr Parks  looking stedfastly at him  Yes but first of all Thorowgood are you really in earnest in this proposal that I should take your furniture clothes corn cows and all that you possess  Tho  Sir I am always in earnest in matters of business  Mr Parks  Have you reflected seriously upon it Do you consider that all your property is at stake  Tho  My property it is no longer mine it is yours Hear me Sir you know perfectly well that I would not attempt to act a generous part by you at the expence of my family I give you up nothing but what belongs to you Rest assured that I would not offer it to you if I thought I could retain it with a safe conscience It would become me truly to make you presents You would laugh at me To cut the matter short I cannot pay you the debt in ready money I resign therefore all my possessions without injury to your remaining claim which I will pay that I will you may depend you shall  be next in consideration after the immediate necessaries of life are supplied  Mr Parks  coolly  Very well but it would be dreadful to strip you entirely Chuse out amongst all these effects what you value most I flatter myself you will not refuse a trifling present of friendship from me  Tho  When you talk so it would ill become me to decline such a favor  He approaches the table and takes a spade and rake  Here then I will retain these instruments of my business with these together with industry and resolution we may always find means to relieve our distress  Mr Parks  What do you take nothing more  Tho  No Sir these are sufficient If heaven will assist me I shall not despair of supporting my wife and children with credit and of laying up by degrees sufficient to pay you  Mr Parks  Very well now is your turn Martha I will have no jealousy you must take something as well as your husband Chuse what you will  Mar  What must I too You are too good indeed Sir  Mr Parks  No compliments Come what do you chuse  Mar  Well then since you are willing to give me some of your property  she runs to the bottom of the room and drawing a curtain  I beg it as a favour Sir that you will let me take the cradle of the infant that I have at the breast  Mr Parks  surprized  What was it included in the things that you were giving up Would you have deprived your infant of a cradle  Mar  coming forward  Would he not always have found one in my arms  Mr Parks  And could you once think that would have accepted it  Tho  I have already told you Sir that children should pay for their parents When the one suffers what pretence can the others have to refuse sharing in the affliction There is nothing that I am not ready to do for my children but at the same time there is nothing that I do not expect from them in return My blood is theirs as their blood is mine  Mr Parks  What a man how unshaken in his principles  aside  What you have taken I give you it is yours Now you surrender the remainder to me your household  goods your clothes corn and the cattle that you have newly acquired Do you transfer all right and property in them to me  Tho  firmly  We do Sir  Mar  And without any regret  Tho  Rather say with the greatest pleasure  Mar  drawing her purse out and offering it to Mr Parks  Receive likewise all the money that we have  Mr Parks takes it and throws it on the table  Tho  Won't you reckon it There are five and twenty pounds  Mr Parks  Your word is sufficient So you make me absolute master of all and you are satisfied that I shall dispose of it as I please without any opposition from you  Tho  As it is now your property we have no more title or claim to it than to your lands We should be strange sort of folks indeed to assume the liberty of controlling you in any respect as to the disposal of it  Mr Parks  Consider well the conditions that you are laying on yourself It is not my intention to extort this agreement from you but once the matter is so settled  Tho  Oh be not afraid that I shall attempt to recall my words No Sir we are already  too sensible of your kindness in allowing us time dispose of all things as you think proper We shall only beg of Heaven that all may prosper in your hands  Mr Parks  Now we understand one another then I acknowledge in turn that I have no farther claim upon you being satisfied for all that you might be indebted to me in consideration of your having surrendered up these effects  Tho  with impatience  But no Sir you would lose considerably this will not amount to one half of your debt Such a parcel of trumpery and rags for a hundred and fifty pounds  Mr Parks  But it is my pleasure to take them at that rate Am not I at liberty to do this as I think proper  Tho  I have nothing to say as to that yet I think it would be better to have them appraised in order to know exactly what they are worth  Mr Parks  Peace friend they have a value in my eyes which no person on carth could possibly estimate They are the fruits of the toil and frugality of an honest and worthy family When I reflect how many drops of sweat they must have cost you I think them of value enough to make me the amplest  satisfaction Now my good friends you owe me nothing  Tho  taking off his hat  Good Sir how shall I thank you  then turning about be throws his arms round Martha's neck and fondly embraces her  Heaven be praised my dear we are no longer in debt  Mar  O matchless goodness how shall we be ever able to shew our gratitude for so much generosity  Tho  With our hearts Martha and there we have funds to discharge our obligations  He advances towards Mr Parks  Will you now be so good as to tell me where we shall carry all these things and when you will be pleased to have the keys delivered up  Mr Parks  I will tell you provided you will forbear to interrupt me  He takes both their hands and addressing them with joy sparkling in his eyes  My good friends I am rich and my parents taught me from my infant years to do good to the virtuous and worthy but I never till this day so fully experienced the exquisite delight of benevolent actions My worthy Thorowgood  squeezing his hand  they behaviour hath filled me with esteem and admiration all that thou hast made over to me to discharge thy debts I restore to thee in turn to acquit myself of a  duty which thy misfortunes and integrity claim from me  Mar  looking up to Heaven  What then shall I no longer be apprehensive of seeing my children in distress O thou worthy thou bounteous landlord  She kisses his hand with emotion  Tho  confounded almost to stupefaction  I can scarcely believe what I have just now heard No Sir it is impossible and though these words may have escaped you in the enthusiastic emotions of your goodness shall I be base enough to avail myself of them No no I never will consent  Mr Parks  Softly softly Thorowgood you just now admitted that I was absolute master of your property and perfectly at liberty to dispose of it agreeable to my own fancy and would you now deprive me of these rights  Tho  throwing himself at his feet  Ah Sir you have seduced me into this but why should I complain Shall I receive bread from Heaven and refuse it from you whom it hath sent as a tutelary angel to relieve us in our distresses Yes I will become worthy of thy bounty by receiving it as it is offered with a soul full of joy and sensibility but furnish me also with proper expressions to  thank you  shedding a flood of tears  I am afraid of not appearing sufficiently grateful for your favours  Mr Parks  raising him  Be comforted Thorowgood I see what is now passing at the bottom of your heart perhaps better than yourself and am fully satisfied Martha call your children I know with what tenderness they love you I would fain let them see that I can love you also  Mar  springing to the door  Jenny Lucy come make haste run as fast as your legs can carry you  Jenny Lucy  from without  Here here we are mother  SCENE XIII  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha Jenny Lucy  Mar  Come my dear children look round about you all that you see there you know we had given up to this gentleman our landlord well then you must know that he has given it up to us back again he will neither take our money our corn nor our cows he acquits us of our whole debt for nothing  Lucy  goes and takes up the hat and presents it to Mr Parks  And will you not then take our money  Mr Parks  No my dear children the alacrity which you have shewn in assisting your parents has taught me how worthy you all are to be relieved in your afflictions take back then all that you have given for them but make that use of it to which your tenderness first prompted you For example Lucy as your father has lost his cattle would you not be glad to employ what you have saved in buying others for him  Lucy  with a dejected look  I am far short of having enough for that  Mr Parks  But supposing that you had enough would you be well pleased to make such a present  Lucy  Ah Sir I should leap for joy  Mr Parks  I should be curious to see how you and Jenny would behave on such an occasion Thorowgood as you understand these matters better than your daughters I commission you to go tomorrow to market for them and buy for each of them six young heifers the best that you can find The money will be ready to pay them at my house it is a little present which I make your children  that they may have the pleasure of making you one in turn  Martha  Ah dear Sir when will you have done heaping favours Come my children and join with me in thanking our generous benefactor  Martha Jenny and Lucy throw themselves at Mr Parks's feet and kiss his hands weeping for joy whilst Thorowgood motionless and silent looks at him with profound astonishment  Mr Parks  turning aside to conceal his tears  Rise Martha rise my good girls  Tho  Sir I knew you very well to be a man of humanity and a worthy man but I was not sufficiently acquainted with all your virtues and I am really at a loss how to behave to you  To Martha  O my beloved wife oh that we could but comprise in one word one single word all that our hearts now feel  Turning eagerly to Mr Parks  Sir I will offer my prayers day and night to Heaven not for you no one of your actions is beyond a thousand of my prayers but that there may appear now and then upon earth a few men like you to preserve wretchedness from despair  He takes Jenny and Lucy to the windows  Don't you see my children that hill yonder from the top of which there is a view of the city where  our benefactor resides we go up it every Sunday in our way to church well then we never will ascend it without looking out for his place of abode pouring out our blessing upon it and praying to Heaven for him his wife and all that belongs to him before we go to pray for ourselves Will you remember this  Jenny  O father do you think that I can ever forget it  Lucy  We will begin as soon as we leave home  Tho  Yes Sir every day and every minute in the fields or in our cottage wheresoever we are our first thoughts shall be devoted to you we shall not be sensible of a moment of our existence without reflecting that we enjoy it through your goodness without being ready to lay it down for you at all times You may when you please demand our blood it is yours Ah why can I not at this moment pour every drop of mine into your veins if it would but double the years of your life  Mr Parks  Be happy Thorowgood continue the blessing of your wife and bring up your children to think as you do I will visit you sometimes to enjoy this pleasing sight and I am sure I shall be the better for it  But now all our business is over do you know that I expect a dinner from you  Tho  joyfully taking him by the hand  Better and better still this is a new treat  Mar  with looks of perplexity and confusion  But my dear what can we offer the good gentleman  Tho  in a free manner  Such as we have Martha I know him a bit of dry bread will give him more satisfaction than if he had unexpectedly found a large joint of roast beef at our table  Mar  But still  Mr Parks  with a smile  Make yourself easy Martha  pointing to the baskets which the servants had brought  you will find in that enough to regale us but let us go together and take a walk in your garden we all have occasion for a little fresh air to recruit our spirits  He goes out leading Jenny and Lucy by the hand while Thorowgood and Martha follow him lifting up their eyes to heaven  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  A room in Thorowgood's cottage in the middle of which is seen a large table very decently laid with a clean cloth plates knives c On one side is the basket which Mr Parks's servants brought Martha has just opened it  SCENE I  Martha Lucy Jenny  Mar  taking out of the basket a large piece of cold meat and laying it on the table whilst the children standing round it with pleasure in their looks seem eagerly to examine every thing licking their lips  What a noble piece of meat Our landlord I see has not been sparing of his provisions  Lucy  to Jenny  There sister look what a huge humpbacked pye O I dare say it is very nice  Jenny  to her mother whilst she is carrying the pye to lay it on the table  Mother do you know what is in it  Mar  No my dear the townfolks have many things that we know nothing of in the country  Lucy  Oh our landlord must be a very  worthy good man to give us back all our things buy us cows and bring us such nice victuals besides Jenny we must hatch our eggs and carry him the chickens  Jenny  Oh I do so long to do it I wish they were plump and great chickens now I could do any thing for him I love him so  Lucy  I will go and make him a nosegay of our finest flowers  Mar  That is right and you Jenny you must help to set things torights in the house Go and cut some slices of bread do it properly and when you have done bring it in I want our landlord to see that you know something of the management of a house  SCENE II  Mar  shuts the basket pushes it into a corner and approaches the table  Let me see nothing I think is wanting the napkins and platesnow I must set the chairs  She places chairs round the table  Now every thing is ready he may come as soon as he pleases  SCENE III  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha  Tho  looking with astonishment at the table  and clapping his hands  How is this Sir what have you been doing I believe that you imagined you had kings to entertain what a noble piece of beef and again  pointing to the pye  what a glorious treat is here it looks very tempting  Mr Parks  It is a pye which my wife has sent you  Mar  Is it possible that Madam should think of us  Tho  Oh I readily believe it she treated me in the kindest manner this morning I would lay any wager that next to my wife she is the best woman in the world Odso Martha let the month of January but come and we shall have our turn Look at this woman Sir I defy you to find her equal at managing a wheel  Clapping her on the shoulder  When winter comes she shall during the long evenings spin for yourself and your lady and make you a piece of cloth the finest you ever saw I will warrant it  Mar  What a pleasure shall I have I will not lose a moment  Mr Parks  I am much obliged to you my friends but it is unnecessary Martha has enough to do to mind her children and it would be  Tho  Hold Sir not a word more will I  hear we have suffered you long enough to have your own way it is but just that we should have our will for once at least Would you prevent us from being grateful That would be depriving us of all the pleasure of our lives and you are too good to desire that come let us sit down  He takes a chair and seats himself  There is your place Sir come Martha take yours also  Mr Parks  sitting down  Do not you wait for your children they must sit down with us I wish to have the pleasure of dining with the worthiest family that I know  Tho  And we shall not be behind hand with you Sir we shall also be able to say that we have had at our table the most compassionate and generous man upon earth which is preferable to dining with kings who have not such sentiments  To Martha  Is not Valentine yet returned from the fields  Mar  No my dear nor George  Tho  And the girls what are they about  Mar  You will find presently that they have not been trifling See here comes Jenny  SCENE IV  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha Jenny  Jenny is carrying in a wooden dish with slices of bread and butter on it  Tho  Oh oh the bread that is right come hither child  he takes two pieces of bread lays one before Mr Parks the other before Martha  Though ours be houshold bread it is however well tasted you have what is lighter in town but this is more strengthening for working people luckily it is still quite fresh But how is this Martha you have forgotten something material  He smiles while he presses her hand  It is not your fault my dear on such a day as this our hearts are so taken up with joy and pleasure that we cannot think of every thing  Mar  running her eyes over the table  Something wanting you say what is it pray  Tho  Something to drink wife would you entertain Mr Parks with a horsefeast that would be strange indeed  Mar  What was I thinking of I set it to cool  Tho  Run make haste our cyder is somewhat rough Sir it cuts the throat but is sound  Mar  What do you mean the gentleman has brought some wine  Mr Parks  Yes my friend and I must own that I think my liquor a little better than yours  Tho  You have brought wine too How Sir had you not done enough without that This is too much what bring us wine too  Mr Parks  Oh it is not for you only I mean to drink a part myself This day is to us all a day of pleasure and good wine is an excellent associate with joy and festivity  Tho  Indeed I had formerly some excellent wine always by me which I kept for my father When I happened to meet with good markets in town my first business was to go and buy half a dozen bottles of the best that I could get be the price what it would I did not drink it myself I gave it to wife to keep for those days when my father came to see us and then I entertained him well Do you remember Martha how happy the good old man used to be My children he would say this wine strengthens and cheers me but your affection which makes you deny yourselves comforts for my sake  strengthens and rejoices my heart still more he was sometimes so much affected that the tears flowed down his cheeks You cannot conceive how exquisite the wine tasted to me whilst I had my father drinking by my side  Jenny comes in with two bottles  Mr Parks  I hope you will not find this amiss neither  Tho  Ah Sir your kindness is sufficient to make it delicious  SCENE V  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha Jenny and Lucy  Lucy  carrying a huge nosegay of roses honeysuckles and jessamine approaches Mr Parks curtsies to him and says  Will you permit me Sir to fix this in your button hole  Mr Parks  I am much obliged to you my dear Lucy  he kisses her  but it is as big as yourself I would lay a wager that you have left none for your father and mother Come I must divide it I shall receive nothing for myself alone today there Martha there Thorowgood here is for you Jenny and Lucy here is for you  sharing the flowers  Tho  This is like a weddingday every one his nosegay  Jenny  One would take Mr Parks for the bridegroom he gives the dinner and the flowers  Tho  Well said my Jenny is in her gay mood  Mr Parks  This sprightly remark shall be worth a wedding gown to her on the day of her marriage  Tho  So Sir we have nothing to do but to sit with our arms across and leave you to do every thing her wedding gown she must earn herself  Lucy  But father suppose I should earn mine first  Tho  Do you hear the little baggage Upon my word it becomes such a little girl as you to have such notions in your head but come come let us think of nothing but dinner let us be merry and gay  Mr Parks  Let us wait till your son's return I will not dine until the whole flock be round me  Mar  What a pity it is Sir that you have no children you seem so fond of them  Mr Parks  Ah Martha you make my heart bleed anew Heaven had blessed me with a son but  Mar  An only son and he is dead what a terrible affliction  Mr Parks  I know not if he be dead but he is so to me  Tho  Perhaps he is in some foreign country and you do not hear from him  Seeing Mr Parks drop a tear he presses his hand  Do not afflict yourself my dear Sir pray do not if he be still alive you will certainly see him again What shall you soften the sorrows of the wretched and yet be wretched yourself No no heaven is too just you see how it treats me for only having done my duty and you who rise so far above it can it forsake you Impossible Come come be cheerful let us not lose a moment of this glorious and joyful day  Mr Parks  wiping his eyes  Yes my dear Thorowgood I should reproach myself if I embittered thy joys  Tho  You owe me this attention it would be spoiling your own work But why are my boys so slow in returning today  He rises from table and looks out of the window  I will see whether they are coming Oh I see George  He beckons to him to make haste  Mar  What George all alone does not Valentine come he should know that it is dinner time I beg a thousand pardons Sir for making you wait  Mr Parks  All in good time Martha I am not impatient in such pleasing company an hour sooner or later will make no difference the days are long and provided I get home before it is dark my wife will not be under any anxiety  Mar  Here is George however  SCENE VI  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha Jenny Lucy George  George takes off his hat and bows on seeing Mr Parks  Tho  running to take him by the hand  Come my son look upon that good man next to heaven and thy parents it is to him that thou wilt owe the greatest obligations during life Consider him attentively it is our worthy landlord to whom we were to have given up all that we possessed upon earth and who has now given it back to us  Mar  And who likewise gives to your sisters a fine flock Every day of your life my son you must bless him in your heart we shall set you the example as long as we live and you shall continue that duty when we shall be no more Will you  not Will you promise me to perform this faithfully  George  How is it possible to neglect it when the gentleman has been so good to us but my father said yesterday that we should quit the farm Are we now to continue in it  Tho  Yes for ever my dear boy for ever I hope in God to see my great grandchildren born in it  George  running in transports to Martha  Oh my dear mother it is for your sake that I am most rejoiced I may now tell it you this whole night past I have done nothing but weep on your account  Mr Parks  And why so my good boy  George  taking Mr Parks by the hand and leading him to the window  Come Sir and I will tell you the reason do you see near yonder hedge an old apple tree that has scarcely any leaves on it My mother was saying this spring that she was very sorry that the frost had injured it so much for she had never eat so good apples as it bore in her life and that the tree was likely to die the next morning before she was up my brother and I went to pick out the most flourishing buds we could see in order to engraft them on other trees in the orchard  that in case the old tree should perish my mother might still have some good apples had we left the farm it would have been a sad thing somebody else would have come into it and in time have eaten of the fruit which we had engrafted  Mr Parks  Nothing could be easier than for you to have taken them with you and then nobody would have benefited by your labour  George  Why should I do so that would have been no advantage and though it were I know very well that we ought not to seek an advantage to ourselves that would be a prejudice to our fellowcreatures on the contrary I should have wished them to gather good fruit from our trees  Mr Parks  But did you not just now say that it would be a sad thing if others should eat the fruit which you had engrafted  George  Undoubtedly it would be a sad thing to me that my mother should be deprived of it for though I wish good apples to others I had much rather my mother should have them  Mr Parks  taking him by the hand  Thou art a good boy  Seeing Martha impatient to embrace him  My dear Thorowgood I am every hour more and more and more enamoured  of your children the only contest between you seems to be who shall love the other best  Tho  There is nothing like love and harmony in families When my father and mother were living all my study night and day was how I should please them best I would have carried them on my shoulders in their old age I am amply rewarded I see by experience whatever we do for our parents is returned by our children  Martha  to George  But where is Valentine Why is he not with you  George  He will not come to dinner  Tho  But why so  Geo  He has taken it into his head to finish his weeding before night I pressed him to come home with me promising to assist him as much as I could in the afternoon but he would not listen to me I have bread enough left he said shewing me the half of his breakfast I shall dine upon this  Tho  with some emotion  Excellent lad because I have not been in the field today he wants to do my work He saw us bending under the pressure of misfortune and he would fain support us by his frugality and industry George go back pray and tell him  that we command him to return and that we shall not eat any thing till he comes  turning to Mr Parks  Ah Sir did you but know him you would love him as much as we do  Jenny  Father shall I go along with my sister and George to fetch him  Lucy  I will engage we will soon make him come  Tho  Go then but do not loiter by the way  SCENE VII  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha  Mr Parks  Thorowgood you have no idea of the emotion that I feel this day I see plainly that children are the choicest blessings of heaven  Tho  Yes when they are like ours then indeed they are real blessings and parents enjoy in them a treasure inestimable O Sir you cannot imagine how much the calamities of life are lessened when our children assist us in supporting them  clapping Mr Parks on the shoulder  Only cheer up your heart Sir in whatever part of the world your son may be I firmly believe that he will make your latter days the happiest of your life  Mr Parks  Ah were he but still alive and of the happy disposition of your children But why should I flatter myself with any such vain hopes No I have no longer any son to comfort me in the decline of life Happy Thorowgood you may grow old you will enjoy the delight of seeing yourself revive in the five children to whom you have given birth  Tho  Five children did you say Sir No pardon me only four  He reckons them on his fingers  The little one that is asleep behind the curtain Lucy George and Jenny these are all I have  Mr Parks  And the boy who is in the fields  Tho  He is not my son though I love him as much as if he were so and I have done for him all that I could have done for a child of my own and the worthy lad is deserving of all my tenderness he love us as much as if we had given him birth and he works for our support as if he were the eldest of my little family  Mr Parks  And where is his family  Tho  That we are as much strangers to as you are we saved his life when he was an infant in the cradle my wife suckled him and he has always lived with us He must  not have been of common origin he had round his neck a coral adorned with gold and jewels and the linen he had on was of the finest kind  Mr Parks  You preserved his life you are ignorant of his family and he is not of vulgar race Ah dear Thorowgood quickly tell me how he fell into your hands  Tho  It is a melancholy storyWe then lived in the north of England I rented a farm there on the banks of a river it was an excellent situation and the land yielded abundantlyno thanks to the care of the former tenant though  Mr Parks  Pass over these circumstances pray and only tell me all that relates to Valentine that alone inflames my curiosity  Tho  Well Sir to come to the point at once you must know that one night we were roused from our sleep by the water's rushing into our house on all sides we had hardly time to get upon the roof to wait for relief there in the morning a boat came to our assistance the whole country was under water the river was covered with the ruins of houses and furniture carried away by the force of the current I was endeavouring to comfort my wife who lamented the loss of our cottage but still more that of her son  who was stifled in the water before he awoke in the mean time I suddenly perceived a cradle tossed about in the flood which was running rapidly and threatening every moment to swallow it up I could not bear the sight I threw off my clothes and regardless of danger I plunged into the river swimming with all my might towards the cradle I was driven back several times and almost exhausted with fatigue but the cries of the child which I heard as I approached inspired me with fresh spirits and vigour in short after much difficulty and danger I got up to it and brought it to the bank a good way lower down My wife followed me creeping more dead than alive along the side of the river I presented the infant to her which continued crying until she gave it the breast Poor Martha fancied that she had recovered her lost child We then made all possible inquiries to see if we could discover the parents but we never could get any information our affliction at length ceased we continued to look upon him as our own son I have related the whole story to the boy himself a hundred times I concealed it indeed from my own children to let them enjoy the pleasure of thinking him their brother and to avoid all  occasion of jealousy I have had him instructed like the rest he does his work as well as I can myself he talks as if he were reading out of a book and he can read and write as well as our schoolmaster  Mr Parks  And how long pray may it be since this happened  Tho  About fifteen years and a few months as well as I can remember But hold I can tell you to a minute for I had a memorial drawn up the magistrate of the place signed by the rector and attested by the people who were witnesses of the event When I quitted the country I took care to carry it with me Go fetch it Martha  Mar  It is here in this little box with the clothes and coral which Valentine then had we have kept them carefully and put them by this morning because if you Sir had sold our effects it would not have been just that what belonged to the boy should have gone with them  Tho  Fetch them quickly my dear  Martha  running to fetch the parcel and giving it to Thorowgood  There my dear  Tho  opening it  See Sir  Mr Parks  examines the coral then the mark on the linen and afterwards exclaims in  transport  It is he it is he himself O gracious God hast thou then restored my boy  Tho  in profound astonishment  What say youWhat our Valentine your son O my dear my worthy Sir I see your whole frame is agitated  He takes his hand and supports him  A chair a chair wife quickly he is ready to fall  Mar  running to and fro  I know not what I am about I am quite beside myself How surprized will our dear boy be  At length she fetches a chair Thorowgood makes Mr Parks sit down still holding his hand  Mr Parks  O day for ever blessed to find my son my longlost son again What will be the joy the transports of my wife It is now we shall begin to live Oh lead me Thorowgood lead me to him For heaven's sake let me see my boy and press him to a father's breast  Tho  No Sir no with your leave Joy and surprize would kill my poor Valentine He will be here presently Step into this room until I have prepared him he will be the better able to meet you and you will be more composed  Martha  looking out at the window  Here he comes with his spade on his shoulder look how fast he walks  Mr Parks  running to the window  He comes he comes how my heart beats let me fly to receive him  Tho  stopping him  No Sir that would be of no service to either of you and this time you must let me have my way  He puts Mr Parks into the next room who follows him reluctantly his eyes still turned to the window  SCENE VIII  Martha alone  This event will perhaps make me an object of pity Valentine is now become a great man Who knows if he will have any farther regard for us or whether he will not blush to look on us  shedding some tears  Oh if such a thing were to happen I should never feel comfort more I have brought him up with such care and tenderness I love him so dearly he was like one of my own children  SCENE IX  Thorowgood Martha  Tho  to Mr Parks whom he leaves in the other room  Stay stay here I will let you  know when it is time that you should appear  Seeing Martha in tears  But why this my dear woman why in tears  Mar  Ah my dear it is through joy and sorrow both that I weep  Tho  How are you able to reconcile that  Mar  I am overjoyed that Valentine and his parents have at length found each other but he will be lost to us and this afflicts me Oh if he should ever forget us  Tho  What an abominable notion you have gotten in your head Forget us wife no more than we can forget him I see plainly you know but little of him yet  SCENE X  Thorowgood Martha Valentine George Jenny Lucy  Valen  with eagerness  O my dear father and mother what transports of joy I feel  He lays down his spade and runs to embrace them  Jenny and Lucy have been telling me what the landlord has done for us Where is the worthy gentleman let me kiss his hand and thank him for all his goodness  SCENE XI  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha Valentine George Jenny Lucy  Mr Parks  rushing in and running to clasp Valentine round the neck  Here here my son Yes you are my own son My own flesh and blood My love my life my all  Tho  Do not be alarmed Valentine it is so it is true he is your father  Valen in deep amazement surveys with an astonished eye Mr Parks Thorowgood and Martha by turns he fa  n would speak but his tongue refuses its office  Mar  Yes my dear boy all has now been cleared up this gentleman for fifteen years has bewailed your loss and now we shall weep to lose you  Valen  almost breathless  I your son You my father  He breaks from those that are around him throws himself at his father's knees claps them and imprints a thousand kisses on his hands Mr Parks clasps his son round the neck and reclines his head upon him they remain awhile in this posture silent and drowned in tears  Mr Parks  raising his head a little  Allgracious almighty God what returns shall I make thee for thy goodness  Valen  I have poured out supplications to heaven a thousand times that I might learn to whom I was indebted for life and I have received it from you who have now restored life by your benignant goodness to those who preserved mine What powerful motives are these to increase filial piety and to stimulate all my efforts that I may merit your tenderness by the most zealous duty and affection  Mr Parks  My heart already tells me how worthy thou art of my love Yes my son my dear my only son this heart has been always full of thee But thy mother what transport will she not feel at sight of thee  Valen  Ah lead me to her I entreat you How I long to throw myself at her feet and clasp her in my arms  Mr Parks  Come then my son I reproach myself for every moment that I delay her happiness Let us run let us fly  Tho  stopping them and holding both by the hand  Consider what you are about will you break the good lady's heart by excess of joy No no it shall not be so first let us drink a glass of wine to strengthen our minds and bodies otherwise we shall all be wrong I will then go and break the matter distantly  to Madam and prepare her for the interview with her son Ah Valentine how happy you will be to know her  Valen  I shall see her then today after having so long dreaded that I should never have that comfort It is impossible to express the tenderness that I already feel for her  Mar  And Valentine will you always love me  Valen  Will I love you I will always call you mother as well as her If she brought me into life did not you cherish it with the milk of your bosom after my second father preserved it What must have become of me but for you both Your kindness to me hath been greater than I shall ever be able to repay  Mr Parks  Say not so my child Ah though it were to cost me half of my fortune I am resolved that these worthy people  Tho  hastily interrupting him  I will not suffer you to say another word on this subject your friendship with that of my lady and Valentine will be our best reward I defy you with all your riches to give us any thing equal to that But why do we longer delay sitting down to table Come sit Valentine here beside your father Yes I understand you Martha shall be near  you the good creature loves you so tenderly  Seeing Martha drying her eyes with her apron  Come wife don't be foolish why those tears we are not lost to one another were he a worthless lad then indeed he would be lost to us and we should have reason to lament him  Valen  looking tenderly at Mr Parks  You see them father have I not reason to love them  He lays hold of Martha's hand who can no longer restrain her tears and hides her face whilst Valentine is caressing her with endearing fondness  Tho  Well shall we have an end of this the one is as great a fool as the other Come Martha to divert you a little seat the children and bring us some glasses  Whilst Martha is engaged he turns to Mr Parks  I told you Sir just now that virtue never failed of a reward here you see a proof of it You had scarcely performed a good action before you were instantly recompensed for it You gave us property that was no longer ours and we have given you an only son whom you had considered as lost  He gets up and addressing himself to George Jenny and Lucy who during this whole scene remain silent with their eyes continually fixed on Mr Parks or Valentine  And you my children  hence learn never to despair of heaven or yourselves When a flood fifteen years ago swept away my cottage Providence gave me at the same time the means of requiting one day the man who was destined to be my benefactor This day when the effects of an unfavourable season seemed to threaten me with hopeless destruction it has on the contrary reestablished my little fortune God makes use of every thing to reward those who do their duty It is from two of the most dreadful scourges that we have derived our good fortune let this be a lesson to you all your lives When a man acts right though misfortune should persecute him though the lightning should flash round his head and thunder shake every thing about him so long as he has no reproach to make to himself he remains firm as a rock  striking the table  or if he falls for a moment he rises up again with new vigoura glass of wine Sir  He takes up the bottle and fills round  It is that we may all drink your health  Mar  With the utmost pleasure  Tho  Valentine you alone can call him father with your lips but we all say the same in our hearts as well as youTo your health Sir  Valen  To your health Sir  Mr Parks  with tears in his eyes  I thank you my dear boy I thank you all my children How sweet is the name of father  He drinks  No wine ever tasted so exquisitely to me  Tho  gaily  Nor to me therefore I will replenish to you now Valentine Hear what I say though you are now become a great person I will never suffer you to be called by any other name in my cottage By calling you so we shall be more sensible that you still dwell in our hearts  Valen  And wherever I go if I shall meet you I shall address you by the name of father  Tho  presses his hand all drink to the health of Valentine  But now I think of it Sir we related to you in what manner we found your son it is now your turn to tell us how you lost him  Mr Parks  Most willingly my friend as the recital can no longer distress me I had been married a year when a war broke out and I received orders to proceed with my regiment to the WestIndies my wife notwithstanding all entreaties would accompany me in that long and dangerous voyage after giving birth to this dear boy the only  one that we have left I had an uncle a dignitary of the church who lived near Durham the infant was consigned to a nurse in his neighbourhood that he might have an eye to him and give us information about him I received no account the three first years of my absence Uneasy at so long a silence I wrote to some friends in London the most zealous of them visited the place whence he acquainted me that soon after my departure a sudden inundation had ravaged the country that my uncle had fallen a victim to his intrepid exertions on that calamitous occasion that the house of the nurse had been swept away by the flood and that my son perished with her this dreadful news oppressed me with sorrow and almost broke my wife's heart At my return to England I was restrained from making any researches which appeared useless lest my ill success should revive those bitter sorrows which time had somewhat alleviated  Tho  What for six years that I have been your tenant and might have put an end to your grief I shall never forgive myself for having suffered you to pine so long I often told you of my happiness why did you never mention your sorrows to me  Mr Parks  Could I have thought that  you alone were capable of terminating them And besides I must confess that I endeavoured all in my power to banish these sad reflections from my mind I was particularly fearful of reviving them in the company of my wife This very morning when you wanted to talk about your children don't you recollect how cautiously I endeavoured to turn the conversation to other subjects  Valen  throwing himself into his father's arms  O my dear father with what boundless affection I shall ever love you to obliterate the remembrance of so many tears  Mr Parks  embracing him  Let us mention them no more since their source is at an end  Tho  Do not flatter yourself with that expectation Sir he will make you shed tears as long as you live but they will be tears of joy only You are far from knowing him yet sufficiently when you have observed all his excellent qualities he will become a thousand times dearer to you How happy it makes me to see you so worthy of each other  Mr Parks  It is to your instructions my worthy friends that I am indebted for his merit it was under you he learned to relish sentiments of honour and virtue I have the  comfort to find him exactly such as I would wish to have formed him myself Ah how shall I be able to reward you as I ought  Tho  Reward us Oh that he has done a long time since Valentine himself has taken care of that night and day he has laboured all inches power for our benefit Do you imagine that without his care and toil our fields would have prospered as they have done  Mr Parks  You will have a heavy loss then in losing his assistance  Mar  Alas it is the satisfaction of his society that we shall have most cause to regret  Valen  No father it is but right to tell you of what they perhaps would conceal lest they might again interest your generosity of heart all my efforts were due to them for their care and tenderness to me in my infant years and I had no merit in working for them but as industrious as they are my hands were necessary to them if they lose my assistance it is my duty to make them a compensationthere is but one method luckily it depends on the first favour I have to solicit at your hands and you will not surely refuse me in this joyful and happy moment will you father  Mr Parks  No my son speak out ask  there is nothing that you have not a right to obtain  Valen  Well then I entreat you to give them those lands for me since I am no longer to assist in cultivating them  Tho  passionately  What say'st thou Valentine  Mr Parks  What does he say Ah what fills my heart with rapture as it proves to me that he is full of gratitude Yes my son now am I certain of soon possessing thy affection since I see thee so sensible of the tenderness that these worthy people had for you Thorowgood receive this farm from the hands of our son I will not rob him of the joy that he feels in bestowing it upon you I will only add for myself and my wife the tenement that Humphries occupies which is yours from this moment  Tho  Forbear Sir pray forbear spare us do not quite overwhelm us How shall we be ever capable of discharging our obligations you will make us ungrateful in spite of ourselves  Mr Parks  Do not then begin to be so by robbing me of the joy with which I receive the present that you have made me Is not a son a thousand times more valuable than the lands that I leave you Speak answer me  Would you give your own for any such consideration  Tho  You have always the art to confound and silence me therefore I will leave you to act as you please it would be criminal in us to combat your kindness  He turns to Martha  This morning we were unable my dear to pay half our debts and now we overflow with riches O my children I may now die without being anxious about you and whilst I lose you Valentine I see you provided with a father worthy of you I am afraid my poor brains will be turned with excess of joy  Mr Parks  Come Thorowgood drink a glass of wine to settle them  Tho  An excellent motion and I will second it  After filling the glass round he gets up takes off his hat and twirls it round his head  Come wife come children  Seeing George Lucy and Jenny afraid to take their glasses  Come I say this is a glass of gratitude you must all drink it up Yes Martha notwithstanding all your nods and winks they must do it  Mar  But my dear I am afraid  Tho  interrupting her  So much the better my dear I wish them to feel it in their heads that they may always remember this  great day Let them drink deeply to the health of our benefactor When they shall hereafter reflect on all that he has done for them they will give him back for every drop of wine a thousand tears of gratitude and tenderness Excuse them good Sir they are not yet of an age to comprehend the boundless extent of your favours but let them grow up as long as they live you shall be blessed by them and their children  Valen  Yes I dare answer for them I know their excellent hearts O my dear little sisters and you my brother I shall never forget your kindness to me  He embracrs them  Father you will permit me to husband my pocketmoney and save what I can to give them to settle in the world  Mr Parks  Gently Sir I pray don't offer to encroach on my privileges I just now engaged for Jenny's wedding clothes  Valen  Well then George and Lucy shall be my care Don't you consent my dear mother  Martha presses his hand and answers only with tears  Father Thorowgood won't you give your advice too  Tho  How could I deny you what seems to give you so much pleasure Yes I agree to it for you as much as for myself I stipulate however one condition which I shall propose to Mr Parks  Mrs Parks  Let us hear what it is  Tho  You have often told me that you and my lady wished for a little retreat in these parts to pass the summer in The neighbouring land is to be sold you may buy it and build a lodge to your own mind by these means we shall have you near us for half the year I would lay my life that Valentine would grow melancholy if he were always to be cooped up in the city  Mr Parks  What say you to this my son  Valen  I should be heartily glad of it I must own I like dearly the air of the country  Mr Parks  with a smile  Be it so then You see Thorowgood I am more ready to comply with your desire than you were with mine  Tho  Because there is some difference but I have not done the ground is extensive enough to allow good gardens Look at me Sir you do not yet now all that I am capable of doing I was formerly a gardener and have not yet forgotten my old trade I take upon myself to lay out the garden in such a manner that people shall come far and near to view it as a curiosity  George  I will undertake to dig the canals and trenches to make the terrace and plant the trees of your walk  Mar  And I and my girls will make the borders and plant them with flowers  Jenny  We will take the finest that we have in our own garden  Lucy  skipping about  O when shall we go to work  Mr Parks  What do you mean my friends I must then till your grounds whilst you are at work in my garden  Tho  I guessed that you would still be so unkind as to oppose me Hear me Sir we shall be more expeditious in our work and besides the best time for working in your garden is precisely the season when there is scarcely any thing to be done in the fields Though Valentine be now a person of consequence still I hope that he will not refuse his assistance his hands are used to the management of the spade and to work for you will be the greatest pleasure to him Only let us have our own way every one will work cheerfully and the whole will be finished before you have time to think about it But here comes the worthy Humphries What does he want  He gets up runs and takes him by the hand  SCENE XII  Mr Parks Thorowgood Martha Humphries Valentine George Jenny Lucy  Hum  I come to know Thorowgood whether you are pleased with your cows  Tho  Ah my dear neighbour I am much more so that we can still be friends your return completes my day's joy Come and sit down with us I will seat you in the company of the best man upon earth  Hum  advancing  What do I see our landlord here  Mr Parks  with a smile  No Humphries I am no longer any thing to you but plain Mr Parks there is your present landlord  pointing to Thorowgood  Hum  What is it so Thorowgood  Tho  Yes my friend it is even so but rich as I am we shall be no less familiar than we have been  Hum  I am at a loss to comprehend this  Tho  I believe you it would puzzle many more We rarely meet with a man so generous as our landlord but the short of the matter is that I am now through his favour the master of this farm and your tenement  Mr Parks  It is true I have just now given him the entire property in it  Hum  Well Thorowgood I give you joy of your good fortune with all my heart and I am neither envious nor jealous of it I hope you will be as good a landlord to me as Mr Parks has been  Tho  Ah my friend how happy am I that I now have it in my power to acknowledge your honesty to me this morning Consider what you would have gained by following the advice of a bad man for two paltry cows which you might have retained you would have lost a valuable friend my little fortune would have made you mad with envy and rage On seeing me the owner of your tenement you would have been in continual dread of being turned out by me through revenge That idea would have embittered your life instead of that you have now in me a friend that will stand by you on all occasions It will give me the greatest pleasure to serve you I can begin this moment I return you the two cows you sent me and I hold you exempt from paying any rent for two years  Humphries struck with astonishment cannot utter a word and stares at him open mouthed  Mr Parks  I thought nothing could have  increased the pleasure I felt in conferring favours upon you but the use you now make of them enhances and sweetens my joy beyond any thing that ever I experienced before  He presses his hand  Tho  Ah Sir it would ill become me to profit by your favours and not benefit likewise by your example It is you that have enabled me to oblige my neighbour and I thank you for this additional pleasure  Hum  recovering himself and taking Thorowgood by the hand  Ah my friend how shall I become worthy of your kindness nothing pains me so much as that I have it not in my power to shew my gratitude  Tho  What do you say Humphries God preserve me from doing service to others with the view of having it returned To do good is a wonderful thing that carries along with it its best reward  Hum  Heaven will bless you in your wife your children and all your undertakings and for my part I shall never think of you but with eyes overflowing with the tenderest tears I already wish you happier than myself I am only jealous of one thing it is of the honour that Mr Parks has done you in dining with you Hear me I have a fat lamb that I was going to sell it shall now  serve to renew our friendship Mr Parks you Martha and your children must all come and eat part of it tomorrow  Tho  I like the motion very well What do you say Sir  Mr Parks  I deny nothing this day  Tho  Nor I truly This has been a wonderful day Humphries My wife and I are obliged to go this moment to town but tomorrow shall tell you wonders that will delight and surprize you and that will shew you more clearly that the virtue which remains unshaken in adversity always receives its reward  VANITY PUNISHED  A DRAMA IN ONE ACT CHARACTERS  Mr Waller  Mrs Waller  Valentine  their Son  Mr Ray  Friends to Mr Waller  Mr Nash  Friends to Mr Waller  Michael  a Country Boy  Martin  the Gardener  SCENE I  A Garden  Mr Waller Mrs Waller  Mr Waller  YONDER is our Valentine walking in the garden with a book in his hand I am very much afraid that it is rather through vanity than from a real desire of improving himself that he always appears to be busy reading  Mrs W  What makes you think so my dear  Mr W  Do not you remark that he casts a sidelook now and then to see if any body takes notice of him  Mrs W  And yet his masters give a very flattering account of his diligence and all agree that he is very far advanced for his age  Mr W  That is true But if my suspicions are right and if the little that he can know has made him vain I would rather a hundred times that he knew nothing and were modest  Mrs W  That he knew nothing  Mr W  Yes my dear A man without any great extent of knowledge but upright modest and industrious is a much more estimable member of society than a learned man whose studies have turned his head and puffed up his heart  Mrs W  I cannot think that my son is of that description  Mr W  Heaven forbid But while we are here in the country I shall have more opportunities of observing him and I am resolved to take the advantage of the first that shall offer to clear up my doubts I see him coming towards us Leave me alone with him a moment  SCENE II  Mr Waller Valentine  Val  to Michael whom he pushes back  No leave me Papa it is that little fool of a country boy that comes always to interrupt me in my reading  Mr W  Why do you call that goodnatured child a little fool  Val  Why he knows nothing  Mr W  Of what you have learnt I grant you but then he knows many things which you do not and you may both inform each other a good deal if you will communicate what you know one to the other  Val  He may learn a good deal of me but what can I learn from him  Mr W  f ever you should have a farm do you think that it would be of no service to you to have an early notion of the labours of the country to learn to distinguish trees and plants to know the times of sowing and harvest and to study the wonders of vegetation Michael possesses these different parts of knowledge and desires no better than to share them with you They will perhaps be one day of the greatest use to you Those on the contrary that you could communicate  would be of no service to him So that you see in this intercourse all the advantage is on your side  Val  Well but papa would it become me to learn any thing from a little country boy  Mr W  Why not if he is capable of instructing you I know no real distinction amongst men but that of useful talents and good manners and you must own that in both these points he has equally the advantage over you  Val  What in good manners too  Mr W  In every station they consist in treating all persons as our duty prescribes to us He does so in shewing a particular attachment and complaisance to you Do you do the same do you make a return of mildness and good will And yet he seems to merit them He is active and intelligent I believe him to be possest of goodnature spirit and good sense You ought to think yourself very happy in having so amiable a companion with whom you may at once amuse and improve yourself His father is my fosterbrother and has always had a remarkable affection for me I am pretty sure that Michael has the same for you See how the poor little fellow hangs about the terracewalk to meet you Take care and use  him with civility There is more honour and integrity in his father's cottage than in many palaces His family too has been our tenants for some generations and I should be glad to see he connexion continued between our children  He goes out  SCENE III  Valentine  alone  Yes a fine connexion indeed I think papa is joking This little country boy teach me any thing No I will surprize him now so much with my learning that he will not think of talking to me of his own I'll warrant him  SCENE IV  Valentine Michael  Mich  You won't have my little nosegay then Master Valentine  Val  Nosegay Psha neither ranunculus nor tulip  Mich  Why it is true they are only field flowers but they are pretty and I thought you might like to know them by their names  Val  A great matter indeed to know the  names of your herbs You may carry them where you found them  Mich  Well now if I had known that I would not have taken the trouble to gather them I was resolved not to go home yesterday evening without bringing you something and as I came back from work tho' it was rather late and I had a great mind for my supper I stopped in our close to gather them by the light of the moon  Val  You talk of the moon Do you know how big it is  Mich  Heh Fegs as big as a cheese  Val  Ignorant little clown  Struts with an air of importance while Michael stands staring at him  Look here  shewing him his book  This is Telemaque Have you ever read it  Mich  This is not the catechism our schoolmaster never talked to me about that  Val  No it is none of your country books  Mich  Nay how should I have read it then But let us see it  Val  Do not think of touching it with your dirty hands  holding one of them up  Where did you buy these tanned leather gloves  Mich  Anan it is my hand Master Valentine  Val  The skin is so hard that one might cut it into shoe soles  Mich  It is not with idleness that they are grown so hard You know how to talk very well I dare say and yet I would not change conditions with you To work honestly and offend nobody is all that I know and it would be no harm if you knew as much Good bye Sir  SCENE V  Valentine  alone  I think the little clown had a mind to make game of me But I see company coming on the terracewalk I must put on a studious air before them  He sits down seeming to read in his book with great attention  SCENE VI  Mr and Mrs Waller Mr Ray and Mr Nash  Valentine seated on a bench on one side  Mr Wal  What a fine evening Would you chuse gentlemen to take a walk up this slope to see the sun setting  Mr Ray  I was going to mention it The  weather is delicious and the sky perfectly without a cloud in the west  Mr Nash  I shall be sorry to go from the nightingale Do you hear his charming melody madam  Mrs Wal  I was taken up with thinking My heart was filled with pleasure  Mr Ray  How can one live in town during this charming weather  Mr Wal  Valentine will you walk up the slope with us to see the sun setting  Val  No I thank you papa I am reading something here that gives me more pleasure  Mr Wal  If you speak truth I pity you and if you do notCome gentlemen there is not a moment to lose Let us continue our walk  They walk forward up the hill  SCENE VII  Valentine  seeing them at a good distance  There they are almost out of sight I need not be under any constraint now  Puts the book into his pocket  What an opinion will these gentlemen have of my diligence I should like to be a bird and fly after them to hear the praises that they are giving me  Saunters about yawning and listless for near  a quarter of an hour  I am tired after all of being here alone I can do better The sun is set now and I hear the company returning I will slip into the wood and hide myself in it so that they shall scarcely find me Mama will send all the servants to look for me with lights They will talk of nothing but me all the evening and will compare me with those great philosophers that have been known to go astray in their learned meditations and to lose themselves in woods My adventure will make a fine noise Now for it  He goes into the wood  SCENE VIII  Mr and Mrs Waller Mr Ray Mr Nash  Mr Ray  I never saw weather more pleasing nor a more charming scene  Mr Wal  Gentlemen my pleasure has been doubled by my enjoying it in your company  Mr Nash  The nightingale too still continues his song His voice seems even to grow more tender as night comes on I am sorry that Mrs Waller does not seem to listen to it with as much pleasure as before  Mrs W  It is because I am anxious about my son I do not see him the garden  She  calls him  Valentine He does not answer  Perceiving the gardener she calls him  Martin have you seen my son  Martin  Yes madam about ten minutes ago I saw him turn towards the grove  Mrs W  Towards the grove Bless me if he should lose himself Pray run after him and bring him in  Martin  Yes madam  Goes out  Mrs W  Mr Waller won't you go along with him  Mr W  No my dear I am not uneasy for my part Martin will be able to find him  Mrs W  But if he should take a different way I am frightened out of my wits  Mr Nash  Make yourself easy madam Mr Ray and I will take the two sides of the wood while the gardener shall take the middle We cannot fail of finding him so  Mrs W  Ah gentlemen I did not dare to ask it of you but you know the feelings of a mother  Mr W  Gentlemen do not give yourselves so much trouble I'd rather you would not  Mr Ray  You will not take it amiss that we comply with Mrs Waller's request rather than your's  Mr W  I must confess it is against my inclination  Mr Nash  We will receive your reproaches at our return  They walk towards the grove  SCENE IX  Mr and Mrs Waller  Mrs W  Why my dear whence comes this indifference about your son  Mr W  Do you think my dear that I love him less than you do No but I know better how to love him  Mrs W  And what if he could not be found  Mr W  I should be very glad of it  Mrs W  What that he should pass the night in a gloomy wood What would become of the poor child and what would become of me  Mr W  You would both be cured He of his vanity and you of your injudicious fondness which keeps it up in him  Mrs W  What do you mean my dear  Mr W  I am just now convinced of what I only suspected in the morning The boy's head is filled with excessive vanity and all his reading is but ostentation He has only  lost himself on purpose to make us look for him and to appear absent and forgetful through intense study It gives me more pain that his mind should wander from a right way of thinking than if his steps really went astray He will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time and there is nothing but a wholesome humiliation that can save him  Mrs W  But do you consider  Mr W  Yes every thing He is eleven years old If he can profit any thing by his natural sense or his learning the light of the moon and the direction of the wind may guide him sufficiently to clear the wood  Mrs W  But if he has not that thought  Mr W  He will then better see the necessity of profiting by the lessons that I have given him upon this subject Besides we intend him for the army and in that profession he will have many nights to pass without shelter He will know what it is and not go to a camp quite raw to be laughed at by his companions Then the air is not very cold at this season of the year and for one night he will not die with hunger Since by his folly he has brought himself into a scrape let him get out of it again or suffer the disagreeable consequences of it  Mrs W  No I cannot agree to it and  if you don't send people after him I will go myself  Mr W  Well my dear I will make you easy though I am sorry that you will not let me follow my plan as I intended I shall tell litle Michael to join him as it were by chance Colin too shall be at a small distance in order to run to them in case of an accident For any thing more do not ask it I have taken my resolution and do not chuse by a blind weakness to deprive my son of a lesson that may be of service to him Here are our friends coming back with Martin  Mrs W  O heavens I see and they have not found him  Mr W  I am glad of it  SCENE X  Mr and Mrs Waller Mr Ray and Mr Nash  Mr Nash  Our search has been in vain but if Mr Waller will let us have some lights and servants  Mr W  No gentlemen you have complied with my wife's request you will now listen to mine I am a father and know my duty as one Let us go into the parlour and I will give you an account of my design  SCENE XI  The Middle of the Wood  Valentine  What have I done fool that I was It is dark night and I don't know which way to turn  Calls  Papa papa Nobody answers I am undone what will become of me  cries  O mama where are you Answer your son this once Heavens what is that running through the wood If it should be a robber Help help  SCENE XII  Valentine Michael  Michael  Who is there Who is it that cries so What is it you Sir How do you happen to be here at this time of night  Valentine  O dear Michael my dear friend I have lost my way  Mich  looking at him first with an air of surprize and then bursting out in a laugh  You don't say so I your dear Michael your dear friend You mistake I am only a dirty little country boy Don't you remember Nay let go my hand The skin is only fit to cut up for shoe soles  Val  My dear friend excuse my impertinenc and for pity's sake guide me back to our house My mama will pay you well  Mich  looking at him from top to bottom  Have you finished reading your Tellymack  Val  looking down quite confused  Ah pray now  Mich  putting his finger to the side of his nos and looking up  Tell me my little wise man how big may the moon be just now  Val  Nay spare me I beg of you and guide me out of this wood  Mich  You see then master that one may be a dirty little country boy and yet be good for something What would you give to know your way instead of knowing how big the moon is  Val  I own my fault and I promise never to shew any pride for the future  Mich  Well that is clever But this same repenting by necessity may only hang by a thread It is not amiss that a young gentleman should see what it is to look upon a poor man  s son like a dog and play with him according to his fancy But to shew you that an honest clown does not bear malice I will pass the night with you as I have passed many a one with our sheep on the downs Tomorrow morning early I will take you  home to your papa Here then I'll share my bedchamber with you  Val  O my good Michael  Mich  stretching himself under a tree  Come Sir settle yourself at your ease  Val  But where is this bedchamber of your's  Mich  Why here  Striking on the ground  Here is my bed take your place It is wide enough for us both  Val  What must we lie here under the open air  Mich  I assure you Sir the king himself has not a better bed See what a fine ceiling you have over your head how many bright diamonds adorn it and then our handsome silver lamp  Pointing to the moon  Well what do you think of it  Val  Oh my dear Michael I am ready to die with hunger  Mich  I dare say I can help you there too See here are some potatoes Dress them as you know how  Val  Why they are raw  Mich  It is only to boil or roast them Make a fire  Val  We want a light to kindle one and then where shall we find coal or wood  Mich  smiling  Why cannot you find all that in your books  Val  Oh no my dear Michael  Mich  Well then I'll shew you that I know more than you and all your Tellymacks  Takes a tinderbox with flint and steel out of his pocket  Crack there is fire already now you shall see  He gathers a handful of dry leaves and putting them round the tinder fans with his hand until they take fire  We shall soon have a blazing hearth  He puts bits of dry wood upon the lighted leaves  Do you see  lays the potatoes close to the fire and sprinkles them with dust  This must serve instead of ashes to hinder them from burning  Having laid them properly and covered them once more with dust he turns the fire over them then adds fresh wood and blows it up with his breath  Have you a finer fire in your papa's kitchen Come now they will soon be done  Val  O my good friend what return can I make to your kindness  Mich  Return Pooh when one does good it pays itself But stop a moment While the potatoes are roasting I will fetch some hay for you I saw a good deal lying in one part of the wood You will sleep upon that like a prince But take care of the roast while I am away  Goes out singing  SCENE XIII  Valentine  Fool that I was how could I be so unjust as to despise this child What am I compared to him how little I am in my own eyes when I examine his behaviour and mine but it shall never happen again Henceforward I will not despise those of a lower condition than myself I will not be so proud nor so vain  He walks about and gathers up dry sticks for the fire  SCENE XIV  Valentine Michael hauling in a large bundle of hay    Mich  Here is your bed of down your coverlid and all I will make you a bed now quite soft  Val  I thank you my friend I would help you but I do not know how to set about it  Mich  I don't want you I can do it all alone Go warm yourself  He unties the bundle sprends part of it on the ground and reserves the rest for a covering  That is finished Now let us think of supper  Takes a potatoe from the fire and tastes it  They are  done Eat them while they are warm they are better so  Val  What won't you eat some with me  Mich  No thank you There is just enough for you  Val  How Do you think  Mich  You are too kind I won't touch them I am not hungry Besides I shall have as much pleasure in seeing you eat them Are they good  Val  Excellent my dear Michael  Mich  I dare say you never tasted sweeter at your papa's table  Val  That is very true  Mich  Are you done Come then your bed is ready for you  Valentine lies down Michael spreads the rest of the hay over him then takes off his jacket  The nights are cold here cover yourself with this too If you find yourself chilly come to the fire I'll take care that it does not go out Good night  Val  Dear Michael I shall never be easy until I make you amends for my treating you ill  Mich  Think no more of it I do not The lark will awake

opened her song already and the sun will soon appear behind the hill Let us set out and go to your papa's  Val  rubbing his eyes  What already so soon Good morning my dear Michael  Mich  Good morning

that some accident has happened to him We must send our people to look for him  Mr W  Make yourself easy my love I will go myself But who knocks  The door opens  Look here he is  SCENE XVI  Mr and Mrs

Val  Yes papa I have been well punished for my pride What will you give him that has reformed me  Mr W  A good reward and with the greatest chearfulness  Val  presenting Michael to him  Well this is he to whom you owe it I owe him my friendship too and he shall always share it  Mr W  If that is so I'll make him a little present every year of a couple of guineas for curing you of so intolerable a fault  Mrs W  And I will make him one of the same sum for having preserved my son to me  Mich  If you pay me for the satisfaction that you feel I should pay you too for what I felt So we are clear  Mr W  No my little man we shall not run from our words But let us go to breakfast  all four Valentine shall relate his adventures of the night  Val  Yes papa and I shall not spare myself though I should be turned into ridicule for them I blush for my folly but hope that I shall never have to blush for the same behaviour again  Mr W  My dear son how happy you will make your mother and me by proving that your reformation is sincere and will never suffer a relapse  Valentine takes Michael by the hand Mr Waller gives his to his Lady and they all go into the next apartment  BLINDMAN'S BUFF  A DRAMA IN TWO ACTS CHARACTERS  Mr Jephson  Frank  his Son  Lucy  his Daughters  Isabella  his Daughters  Dorinda  their Friends  Alice  their Friends  Laura  a little lame their Friends  Elder Danby  Friends to Frank  Younger Danby  who stutters Friends to Frank  Roberts  their acquaintance  Mr Jephson's Groom  SCENE  an Apartment in the House of Mr Jephson with a Table and upon it Books and other Papers and a speaking Trumpet in the Corner  ACT I  SCENE I  Frank  speaking to his Father as he goes down stairs  NO no papa do not be afraid I will take the greatest care that no accident shall happen to your papers I will put  up your books too in the closet  He comes forward jumping for joy  We shall have some fine diversion When the cat is away the mice it is said will play  To Lucy who now comes in  Well now Lucy is mama gone out and all our little friends arrived  Lucy  My friends are all three come but none of your companions yet  Frank  O I can easily believe you sister We do not want to run a gadding like you girls and so we are not the first to keep appointments of this nature You must force us from our study if you would have us Look you I would lay any wager that the Danbys at least are hard at work while we are speaking  Lucy  Yes to settle what fine tricks they can contrive to put upon usBut pray Frank is it true that papa will let us pass the evening here Our room above is so very small we could not have found room to turn ourselves well round  Frank  Could my papa refuse you any thing when I concerned myself to ask it Softly little girl do not discompose the papapersLet them lie  Lucy  Keep that advice Sir to yourself I meant to lay them smooth  Frank  with an air of importance  No no  you cannot miss I am charged with that commission  Lucy  Truly my papa could not have given it to so orderly a gentleman let me at least assist you then and afterwards I will put the chairs in order These great books I shall remove first  Frank  Do not think of touching them At most I can permit you only to take one by one and pile them up upon my hand  She does so till they reach his chin  Lucy  There is enough  Frank  leaning backwards  One more only SoI have now sufficient for one turn  He takes a step or two when all the books fall down  Lucy  bursting out a laughing  Ha ha ha ha there there they go Those handsome books that papa would never let us touch I fancy he will be greatly pleased to see them all tumbled together thus  Frank  I had lost the center of Gravity as my tutor says and you know he is Gravity itself  He picks the books up but they tumble down as fast as he gathers them  Deuce take it They have been at Sadler's Wells I think and learned to tumble sure  Lucy  You will never finish if I do not assist you So d'ye see I will spread my apron and do you stoop down and pile them in it  Frank  That is well thought indeed  Frank goes upon his knees takes up the books and places them in order in his sister's apron  Lucy  Softly brother they will rub one against another So I have got them all and now I will carry them into the closet  She goes out  Frank  rising out of breath  Bless me I should never do to live in the country where men go upon allfours like monkies  He fans himself with his hat  Lucy  reentering  Could you see how neatly I have ranged them on the chimney you would be charmed So let me have the rest  Frank puts the other books and all the papers in his sister's lap who says when she receives them  Well every body must acknowledge that girls are cleverer than boys  Frank  O yes and you particularly Isabella is constantly employed in putting by your shreds and rags  Lucy  And if your tutor had not constantly his eye upon you you would never know where you should find your exercises and translations  She looks about her  But I fancy I have now got them all  Frank  Yes yes there is nothing left so get you gone  Lucy goes out  Frank  putting back the chairs and tables in their places  There so that is done and we  shall now have elbowroom enough I cannot help thinking what fine work we shall be sure to make However I am surprised that they are not come yet For my part I can say I hardly ever make any one wait for me when a visit is in the case  Lucy  entering once again and looking round about  Ay very well but brother you must hide this speaking trumpet If your friends should happen to perceive it they will be sure to stun us with their noise  Frank  Stay stay I will put it up behind the door as perhaps I shall want it Let your little friends come now and din me with their chattering as they used to do and we shall see who will cry out loudest  Lucy  Psha we need but join together we should very shortly get the upper hand of such a little thing as you  Frank  O no for if you ladies have your clappers so well hung we gentlemen possess a fine clear manly voice which every one respects as thusYou hear me  Lucy  shrugging up her shoulders  Yes and have so much respect as you say for you that I will take myself away Farewel I will run and join my friends  Frank  And bid the servant send me up my visitors when they arrive  Lucy  Yes yes  She withdraws  Frank  taking up the speaking trumpet  Here is what has often brought me from the furthest corner of the garden much against my inclination and I think I hear it still So ho there Frank FrankMy young friends live only at the corner of the street Let me see if I can hurry them  He puts the trumpet to his mouth throws up the window and cries out  Girls and boys come out to play  The moon doth shine as bright as day  Come with a whoop and come with a call  Come with goodwill or not at all  He leaves the window and draws near the door  Well is not this surprising It is like Harlequin's enchanted horn I think I hear them talking to each other on the stairs  He listens  Yes yes I protest the two Danby's  He puts the trumpet by  Suppose I were to jump on the table and receive them sitting on my throne  He runs to fetch a stool that he may put it one the table and prepares to take a spring but the arrival of the two Danby's prevents him  SCENE II  Frank Elder Danby Younger Danby  Frank  Could not you have staid a little at the door till I was mounted on my throne that I might give you audience as they say in all my glory  Elder Danby  Good indeed you have no occasion to look exactly like a king And active as you are the throne might possibly cause your majesty a tumble  Frank  Why to say the truth I have read of many tumbles of that nature in my ancient history  Elder Danby  And in some sort such an accident has happened to my brother though he is no great prince He fell down stairs last week and hurt his nose considerably  Younger Danby  stuttering  Yes indeedeed It pains me stistill a little and that maaaster Roberts is a very nauauaughty boy  Frank  Does he design to come tonight  Elder Danby  I hope not if we had expected him here we should not have stirred out  Younger Danby  He ooonly thinks of mismischief  Frank  What has he done then  Elder Danby  We were both going out last Saturday I stopped to get a handkerchief my brother went down stairs alone and as it happened Roberts hearing some one came out slily jumped at once upon my brother who was frighted lost his footing and rolled down the stairs from top to bottom  Frank  Poor Danby I am sorry for you  Roberts looks for all the world as if he loved such mischief We shall have his company this evening for the first time in our lives his father begged papa to let him come and see us  Elder Danby  I am sorry for it for we do not speak to one another  Frank  My papa supposed you all good friends because you lodge together and considered that you would have the greater pleasure if he came  Elder Danby  The greater pleasure We should like to have him ten miles off Since he has been our neighbour we are continually uneasy He has frequently amused himself with breaking windows and then tried to lay the blame on us  Frank  Does no one complain about him to his father  Elder Danby  Oh I do not know what to make of him he is such an odd sort of a man He scolds a little pays the damage and that is all  Frank  If I were your papa I would quit my lodgings and live somewhere else  Elder Danby  Yes so he means to do and therefore yesterday gave warning and now we are forbidden all manner of connection with this Roberts he is so wicked Would you think it very few go by the house without  being apprehensive that he will put some trick upon them Sometimes he diverts himself by squirting puddle water at them or else pelting them with rotten apples Nay he will sometimes fasten rabbits tails or bits of rags behind their backs at which the people when they see it all burst out a laughing Then too he has what he calls his  caxen fishery  Frank  Caxen fishery  Elder Danby  Yes he will take the people's wigs off as they pass him with a hook as you would carp When any poor man stops before his window to converse with an acquaintance Roberts immediately goes up to the balcony with a string suspended from a fishingrod and at the end of it a hook with which he jerks the poor man's wig off Then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpose after which he drives the creature out into the street and off he sets that instant so that the poor perriwig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud before its owner can lay hold of it again  Frank  But this is more than mere amusement  Elder Danby  And yet this is nothing to the stories that I could tell you Why he lames or bruises all the dogs and cats that  come within his reach Nor is it long ago when one of his relations broke a leg by slipping down upon the stairs where Roberts had been scattering peas on purpose Ay it is so or else our name is not Danby And for the servants I am sure his father would not get one to attend him if he did not pay extraordinary wages  Frank  Shall I tell you now I long to see him I like boys a little merry  Elder Danby  Nothing is more natural but Roberts's mirth is not like other children's You I know love laughing in your heart but would not for the world hurt any one whereas this wicked fellow laughs at bumps and bruises  Frank  Oh that does not fright me in the least I shall be much more pleased in paying him as he deserves  Elder Danby  If he should come my brother will not offend you by withdrawing He would do him some fresh mischief  Younger Danby  Yeyeyes I will go  Frank  No no we are old friends and positively no new comer shall divide us I will take care and manage him I warrant youBut do not I hear a noise upon the stairsIt is RobertsNo I see my sister and her company  SCENE III  Frank Elder Danby Younger Danby Lucy Isabella Dorinda Alice Laura  Lucy  Your humble servant my good friends but why not seated brother You might easily have got the gentlemen a chair apiece since they have been with you Sure there has been time enough  Frank  As if we did not know that it is usual to stand up when we receive ladies  Lucy  I am charmed to find you know your duty but where is master Roberts  to the Danbys  I did suppose that you would have brought him with you  Elder Danby  It is a long time now thank Heaven since we have been separated from him  Dorinda  Is he then unluckier than Lucy's brother  Laura  archly  Certainly he would be unlucky then indeed  Alice  Lucy's brother He is a very lamb to Roberts We have known him for a long time Have we not dear sister  Laura  We have and he has played me many a trick  Alice  He was very intimate with Anthony my brother but he is rid of him entirely now why he is the saddest fellow in the world  Lucy  Oh as for that my brother is even with him there  Dorinda  But to do mischief merely for the pleasure of itthere is the villainy  Lucy  No no my brother is better than that comes to  Frank  with an air of irony  Do you really think so I am obliged to you  Dorinda  Well well my dear Lucy we will be under your protection you are the biggest of us and besides at present you are mistress of the house and may command him  Lucy  Do not you be afraid I will keep him perfectly in bounds  Frank  Yes yes Lucy you shall take care of the ladies and for you  to the Danbys'  I will take you under my protection  Elder Danby  Oh he will hardly think of playing tricks with me He knows me I assure you I only fear for my brother  Younger Danby  He makes gagame of me yes alalways  Laura  That is his way he always attacks the least He would never vex my sisternone but me  Lucy  I can believe you such as he are always cowards I compare him to a puppy following close upon a cat as long as she keeps running but if once the cat turns  round and shews her whiskers then the puppy scampers for it  Frank  Well then sister you shall be the cat  Laura  And let him see your whiskers  Lucy  But methinks it would not be amiss if we sat down Though we expect this Mr Mischiefmaker we have no need I fancy to remain standing up till he chuses to appear  Frank  Hush here he is  SCENE IV  Frank Elder Danby Young Danby Lucy Isabella Dorinda Alice Laura Roberts  Roberts  to Frank and his sister making them a bow  Your servant Your papa was pleased to let me wait upon you so I am come to spend the evening with you  Lucy  We are glad to see you and shall have a deal of pleasure in your company at least my brother  Isabella  Yes indeed he wants for good example  Frank  Do I So your g  d example you would have the gentleman  uppose is not sufficient  Lucy  Well a truce to compliments As mistress of the house it is necessary that I  should let you know who is who This tall young lady in the first place is Miss Dorinda Lambton  Roberts  with a banter  I am charmed to hear it  Lucy  And these are the Miss  Roberts  O I know them very well This here is  pointing to Alice  my ladywhat is her name Pentweazle that will take you off the company as simple as she seems and there is  pointing to Laura and limping round the room  Miss Upanddown who broke her leg by running from the rod This gentleman  Elder Danby  observe him he is a grave wise Grecian who looks strait before him when he walks as if he pitied us poor silly children And this other good little friend of mine  pointing to younger Danby and letting fall his hat  is Pepepeter Grievous whose dear mama forgot poor creature to untie his tongue when he was born  The children seem surprized and stare at one another  Frank  And who am I sir for methinks you seem quite clever at this sort of portrait painting  Roberts  Oh I am not sufficiently acquainted with you yet to take your likeness but I shall let you have it soon  Lucy  For you sir I could draw you at a  glance and I must tell you the similitude would not be very pleasing I could never have supposed it possible that any well bred little gentleman as I imagine you affect to be should think of turning natural defects into a theme for banter If my little friends were not sincerely such they would have reason to reproach me for exposing them to your indecency But they can see that I could not have expected half so much myself  Roberts  Why Frank I protest your sister is mighty eloquent You need not go to church on Sundays having such a charming preacher in the house  Frank  She has tolerable skill when any one is to be told the truth and therefore both my sister Isabella and I love her sincerely  Roberts  Well well you see I have tolerable skill likewise in telling truth and therefore no doubt you will love me too sincerely  He bows to Lucy  I ask your pardon miss for having taken the employment out of your hands as you are yourself so clever at it  Lucy  Your excuses and your bow are both an insult but an insult such as I despise Though were they on the other hand sincere they would hardly make atonement for so coarse an incivility If I had not considered  every word that you said as meant in joke however gross I cannot but suppose it I should know what suited me to do and should have done it likewise Let me therefore beg sir that you will indulge in no more freedoms of this nature if you mean that we should remain together  Roberts  somewhat embarrassed  Well but I see you do not understand a little harmless piece of banter Let us be friends  He holds out his hand  Lucy  giving her's  With all my heart sir but provided  Roberts  turning his back suddenly upon Lucy and addressing young Danby  You are an honest little fellow too and I will shake hands with you  He hesitates to give his hand and therefore Roberts seizing on him shakes his arm so roughly that he falls a crying  Elder Danby  Master Roberts  Frank  laying hold of Roberts's arm  Pray sir let this child alone or  Roberts  Wellor whatmy little Jackadandy  Frank  boldly  I am little I acknowledge but yet strong enough and so you will find me when my friends require to be defended  Roberts  Say you so in that case I should like to be one of them But beforehand if you please we will have a brush just to see  how you will be able to defend them  Roberts on a sudden tries to fling him down but Frank stands his ground and Roberts falls The company rush in to part them  Frank  But one moment if you please young ladies I will not do him any harm Well Mr Roberts pray how do you find yourself I fancy I am your master  Roberts  struggling  Take your knee off or you will stifle me  Frank  No no you must not think of getting up unless you first ask pardon  Roberts  furiously  Pardon  Frank  Yes sir and of all the company as you have certainly offended all the company  Roberts  Well well I do ask pardon  Frank  If you should insult us again be assured we will send you down into the cellar till tomorrow morning which will surely cool your courage That is much better than to hurt you We do not think you worth the troubleRise  He gets from off him and when both are up continues  You have no right to be offended for remember it was yourself began the contest  Roberts seems ashamed  Dorinda  aside to Isabella  I could never have supposed your brother half so valiant  Isabella  Oh a lion is hardly bolder and  yet Dorinda he never quarrels He is in short although I say it the best tempered little fellow in the world  To the company  But what are we doing We ought to think of some amusement for the evening  Frank  Certainly we ought or why are we all come together Well what play shall we chuse Something funny What say you Danby  Elder Danby  We will let the ladies chuse  Roberts makes mouths at Frank and Danby the rest pretend as if they did not see him  Lucy  There Frank there is a lesson for you we may chuse Well then suppose we play at questions and commands or possibly you would like a game at cards much better  Laura  I should rather play at something with the least Danby if you have a picturebook we will turn it over shall we  Younger Danby  Ooooh yes yes  Lucy  With all my heart sweet dears I will carry you up stairs You will neither want for pictures nor playthings there  Laura and the younger Danby take hold of one another by the hand and jump for joy  Lucy  to the ladies  My friends will you go with me for amusement into my apartment I have a charming bonnet that you will like to see  All  together  Yes yes yes let us go  Elder Danby  Will you accept my hand as far as your apartment Miss Lucy  Lucy  Rather let Miss Dorinda or Alice have it if they please  The elder Danby presents his hand to Alice who happens to stand next him  Roberts  What then do you mean to leave me by myself here  Frank  No sir these young ladies will excuse me so I shall stay but I am obliged to leave you for a moment  Roberts  Are you but I will follow you I do not like to be left alone by night and in a house where I am a stranger  ACT II  SCENE I  Frank Roberts  Roberts  The truth is I was apprehensive lest you might think of playing me some trick so I accompanied you But now that we are returned and all alone we may devise some mirth between us  Frank  Very willingly I ask no better so let us think a little  Roberts  We must have some fun I fancy with the younger Danby  Frank  If by fun you mean some trick to hurt him I say no I will not be in a joking humour so pray leave him out if you are bent on mischief  Roberts  They told me that you were always merry and fond of something funny  Frank  And so I am but notwithstanding without hurt to any one However let me know what sort of fun you meant  Roberts  Look you here are two large needles I will stick them both with the points upward in the bottom of two chairs that common eyes shall not discern them in the next place you shall offer two of these young ladies the two chairs for very likely they would suspect that I meant them mischief of some sort or other and they will naturally both sit down but figure to yourself what strange grimaces they will both make Ha ha ha ha It makes me die a laughing when I barely think what faces we shall see them put on Ay ay and your prudish sister too will find the matter quite diverting  Frank  But suppose I were to treat you just in the same manner would you like it  Roberts  Oh treat me that is different but those little idiots  Frank  So you call them idiots do you since they are not mischievous  Roberts  Well you are mighty formal and precise Then shall I mention something else  Frank  Yes do  Roberts  Then I have some thread as strong as whipcord in my pocket I will thread one of these great needles with a little of it and as soon as they are all come down one of us shall go up very politely towards them make a deal of scraping and wry faces while the other keeping still behind shall sew their gowns together They will all want to dance as you may guess so up we will come and take them outHa ha you know the rest ha ha ha ha ha  Frank  Yes to tear their gowns and get them anger when their parents find it out  Roberts  Why there is the fun  Frank  What have you no pleasure then in any thing but doing mischief  Roberts  But is does not hurt me  Frank  O ho I understand you think of no one but yourself and all the world is nothing to you  Roberts  Well but we are come together to divert ourselves and we must positively have some laughing So suppose we frighten Laura and the least Danby  Frank  But that is quite wrong Supposing any one should frighten you  Roberts  With all my heart if any one is but able I am afraid of nothing  Frank  aside  Say you soThat we shall see perhaps  Aloud to Roberts  Well about this frightening  Roberts  I have an ugly mask at home I will run and fetch it And do you when I am gone contrive to bring the little children down and you shall seeI will not be absent half a minute  Frank  aside  GoodThere shall be a better mask ready for you though  To Roberts calling him back  But Roberts Roberts  Roberts  What is the matter  Frank  It will be better that we should come upon them where we are if I can bring the others down for when there are but two or three in this part of the house there sometimes comes a spirit and in that case we ourselves should be but badly off  Roberts  What is all this story of a spirit  Frank  Nay it is true At first one hears a noise and then a phantom with a lighted torch glides by and then the room seems all on fire  He draws back as if afraid  Oh methinks I see it now  Roberts  a little frightened  See what O dearAnd what can bring the phantom here  Frank  drawing Roberts towards a corner and then whispering to him  The reason as we are told is this There was a mi  er who lived here formerly and he was robbed one night of all his money in despair he cut his throat and now from time to time his ghost goes up and down  Roberts  in a tremble  O ho I will stay no longer here unless you get more company  Frank  But recollect how brave you were just now  Roberts  You must not fancy I am afraid butbutbutbutbut I will go and fetch my mask  Frank  Do do and I will prepare things hereWhat pleasure we shall have  Roberts  with a grin  Oh enough to make one die with laughing  Frank  They will be finely frightened  Roberts  That they will and therefore I will make haste I am at home and back againyou shall see how soon  He goes out  Frank  close  Ah ah you want to frighten others and are not afraid yourself Well well I have thought of something that will frighten you or I am very much mistaken  SCENE II  Frank Lucy Isabella Dorinda Alice Elder Danby  Lucy  We saw Master Roberts run across the street this momentWhat is the matter Have you had a quarrel  Frank  On the contrary he thinks me his best friend I have seemed willing to go shares with him in a trick that he means to put upon the little ones above but it is himself that he will trick and never wish to come here a third time  Lucy  Well what is your project  Frank  You shall know very soon At present I have no time to lose for every thing must be in readiness against his coming back so ladies I request permission to be absent for about five minutes  Dorinda  Yes go go but do not stay longer We are all impatient to be told what you design  Frank  I shall consider it my duty to inform you when I have finished my preparations So once more with your leave I will come again in less perhaps than five minutes  He goes out  Lucy  Ah ah ahTwo pretty fellows together We shall see what good comes out between them They are well matched  Elder Danby  Oh for Heaven's sake Miss Lucy do not do such dishonour to my friend your brother as to name him and that wicked Roberts together  Alice  You are in the right Danby One is nothing but politeness and the other quite a savage  Isabella  Savage as he is however I would lay a wager that Frank will be found his master  Dorinda  What a piece of service Frank would do us could he clear the house of such a fellow We shall have no pleasure all the evening if he stays among us  Lucy  I am afraid however Frank will proceed too far and think himself permitted to do any thing against this Roberts  Elder Danby  He can never do enough and though his scheme should be a little hard on Roberts there will be instruction in it it is the greatest service that one can do him and his father I am persuaded will be pleased with Frank when he hears what pains he has taken to instruct his son Alas he would part with half his fortune to have Roberts like him  Alice  So Lucy do not you go about to thwart your brother's good intentions  Lucy  But my dear Miss Alice I am in a ticklish situation I am now instead of my  mama and cannot possibly let any thing go forward that she would not approve  Alice  Let him have his way We will take the blame of what he does upon ourselves  Isabella  Yes let him sister War I say war war for ever with the wicked  Frank  returning joyfully  I have settled every thing and Roberts may appear whenever he thinks proper We will receive him  Lucy  But I hope you will tell me  Dorinda  Yes we will be in the plot too and more than that assist you if we can  Frank  No ladies that is not necessary There is a little violence I must acknowledge in my plot and therefore I will not make you parties I have been settling every thing with Ralph in the stable He conceives my meaning clearly and will second it with great dexterity  Lucy  But still you do not acquaint me  Frank  This is all of the contrivance that you need know We will go to Blindman's Buff that Roberts may suspect no harm on his return I will let myself be caught and he or she that blinds me must take care that I may have an opportunity of seeing through the handkerchief and fixing upon Roberts After he is blinded you shall steal into the closet take away the lights and leave us both together When I want your aid I will call you  Frank  It is master Roberts but he was not in the play You must begin again  Roberts  Undoubtedly Frank is right  Dorinda  Well be it so but if I catch you again it shall be all fair Remember I have warned you  Roberts  O yes yes  He takes Frank aside and lets him see a little of the mask  What think you of it  Frank  feigning to be frightened  O how frightful I should certainly be terrified at seeing it myself Well hide it carefully we will play a little and then slip away  Roberts  whispering Frank  Yes yes we will but I must first of all do something to teize the ladies  Frank  whispering Roberts  I will go up to Dorinda and turn her round if she should catch me she will suppose it to be you and must set out again  Roberts  whispering Frank  Good good I will have a little sun with her too  Alice  Well when will you have told each other all your secrets Two fine gentlemen why do not you see the game stands still  Roberts  You need not stay for us we are ready  Frank  Aside  keeping near Miss Dorinda as if he wished to pull her by the gown and seeing Roberts go to fetch a chair  Now Miss Dorinda I will put myself into your way  Roberts brings a chair and puts it so that Dorinda may tumble over it but Frank takes it away and puts himself instead upon his hands and feet with so much noise that Dorinda may hear him As she slides  along her feet as if at hazard she encounters Frank sloops and seizes him  Dorinda  after having felt about his cape and wrists and seeming doubtful  It is Master Frank  Frank  in appearance disconcerted  Yes indeed I am taken What ill luck so soon  Dorinda  pulling off the bandage  O ho you wanted to throw me down I thought nobody but master Roberts played such tricks but it shall not be long before I take revenge  She covers Frank's eyes so that he can see a little leads him towards the middle of the room and as is the custom of the game asks him  How many horses in your father's stable  Frank  Three black white and grey  Dorinda  Turn about three times and catch whom you may  Frank gropes about and lets himself be josiled as they please Dorinda particularly plagues him he pretends to follow her but all at once turns round and falls on Roberts  Frank  Ah ha I have caught you have I It is a boy It is Roberts  pulling of the handkerchief  Yes yes I am not mistaken  Roberts  whispers Frank  Why lay hold on  me  Frank  whispers Roberts  Do not mind it You shall catch Danby I will push him towards you  Roberts  to Frank  Do and you shall see how I will make him squeak I will pinch him till the very blood comes  Frank covers Roberts's eyes and nods to the company as he had settled it Elder Danby and the little ladies t  ke away the lights and all together run into an adjoining closet quietly  Elder Danby  as be steps into the closet  Well have you finished Oh make haste You take a  deal of time What mischief are you whispering to each other  Here the groom presents himself at the door with a lighted torch in one hand and a stick beneath it in the other with a large fullbottomed wig upon it He is covered over with Mr Jephson's gown trailing on the ground behind him Frank beckous him to keep back while he is blinding Roberts  Frank  putting Roberts in the middle of the room  How many horses in your father's stable  Roberts  Three black white and grey  Frank  Turn about  pretending to be angry with the others  Be quiet pray young ladies and not quit your places till the game is begunTurn about three times and catch whom you may  While Roberts turns about Frank runs for the speaking trumpet bids the groom untie a chain that he has about his waist which falling makes a hideous noise and then he cries out lustily himself  The ghost the ghost Run Roberts for your life  He claps the door to violently hides himself behind the Groom and speaking through the trumpet says  It is you then that come to steal my treasure  Roberts  trembling with fear and not daring to pull off the bandage  Fire fire Danby Where are you Frank Murder murder Dorinda  Frank  speaking through the trumpet  I have seared them all away Pull off your bandage and look at me  Roberts without pulling off the bandage puts his hands up to his face retiring from the ghost  Frank  Pull it off I say  Roberts pulls the bandage down about his neck but dare not lift his eyes up and at last when he observes the ghost he screams out and has not power to move  Frank  I know you well your name is Roberts  Roberts hearing this runs up and down to get  away but finding the door shut falls down upon his knees holds out his hands and turns away his head  Frank  What you think to escape me do you  Roberts  after several efforts  I have done nothing to you You were never robbed by me  Frank  Never robbed by you You are capable of any villainy Who squirts at people in the street Who fastens rabbits' tails behind their backs Who fishes for their wigs Who lames poor dogs and cats Who sticks up pins in chairs to prick his friends when they sit down And who has in his pocket even now a mask to frighten two poor little children  Roberts  I have done all this indeed I own it but for heaven's sake pardon me and I will not do so any more  Frank  Who will answer for you  Roberts  Those that you have frightened away if you will but call them  Frank  Do you promise me yourself  Roberts  Yes yes upon my honour  Frank  Well then I take pity on you but remember had it been my pleasure I might easily fly away with you through the window  Here the phantom makes his torch glare like lightning and then goes out Roberts almost swooning with terror salls on his face  SCENE the Last  Roberts Frank the Groom Mr Jephson  Mr Jephson  entering with a candle in his hand  What is all this disturbance  Roberts  without looking up  It is not I that make it Pray pray do not come near me  Mr Jephson  perceiving Roberts on the ground  Who can this be on the ground  Roberts  You know me well enough and have already taken pity on me  Mr Jephson  I already taken pity on you  Roberts  It was not I that robbed you  Mr Jephson  Robbed me what does all this mean do not I know you master Roberts  Roberts  Yes yes that is my name good ghost so pray do not hurt me  Mr Jephson  I am astonished why in such a posture  He puts down the light and lifts him up  Roberts  struggling first of all but knowing Mr Jephson after wards  Mr Jephson is it you  his features brighten  He is gone then is he  he looks round about him sees the ghost and turns away again  There there he standsthe phantom don't you see him  Frank brings the children from the closet Laura and younger Danby are frightened at the groom's appearance but the rest burst out a laughing  Mr Jephson  Well what signifies all this  Frank  coming forward  Let me explain the whole papa This phantom is your groom and we have put on him your wig and gown  Groom  dropping his disguise  Yes sir it is I  Mr Jeph  An odd sort of sport this Frank  Frank  True but ask the company if master Roberts has not well deserved to be thus frightened He designed to frighten Laura and Danby I only wished to hinder him Let him but shew the frightful mask that he has about him  Mr Jephson  to Roberts  Is this true  Roberts  giving him the mask  I cannot deny it here it is sir  Mr Jephson  You have met with nothing then but what you deserve  Dorinda  We persuaded Miss Lucy to permit her brother to make use of this device to punish Roberts  Alice  If you knew besides sir all the other tricks that he meant to play us  Mr Jephson  What sir is this the sample that you give us of your behaviour the first time you set foot within my doors You have been disrespectful to me in the person of my children who were pleased with the expectation of having you as their guest You have been disrespectful to these ladies whom I need not say you should have honoured and regarded So be gone Your father when he comes to know that you have been turned out of doors will see how necessary it is to correct the vices of your heart I will not permit your detestable example to corrupt my children Go and never let me see you here again  Roberts is confounded and withdraws  And you my friends although the circumstances of the case may very possibly excuse what you have done yet never for the time to come indulge yourselves in such sport The fears which have power to affect children at a tender age may possibly be followed by the worst consequences during their whole life Avenge yourselves upon the wicked only by behaving better and remember after the example which master Roberts has afforded you that by intending harm to others you will oftenest bring it down upon yourselves  THE END
