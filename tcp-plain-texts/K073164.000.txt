signed  ANNA MATILDA  except the  REPLY  to  REUBEN  have been before the Public Desirous to have her name united with that of  DELLA CRUSCA  's longer than the fleeting fame of Newspapers allows  ANNA MATILDA  had begun to recall some fugitive trifles in order to form them into a volumewhen she saw the Poetry of  DELLA CRUSCA  c advertised by  Mr Bell  This did not induce her to change her  design  only the  mode  of it and still wishing to be united with her favourite bard in a distinct publication she offered his publisher her Poems on condition of their being form'd into a volume similar to histhe offer was accepted  Not having however Poetry enough to form such a volume she was persuaded to enrich it with some curious  PROSE  written  "in other times"  The Fragment subjoined to the Poems is from the  autograph  of the famous  Sir William Waller  an important Actor in the busy drama of the last  century The manuscript has been preserved in a family to which its Editor is allied and who are pleased at an opportunity of making their treasure public how then can  ANNA MATILDA  fear for her  poetic existence  when it is protected on the one hand by the best Lyric of the

Close on the verge of  WINDSOR FOREST  HAVE I then left you sweet Hygeian bowers  Oh have I left you  friendship's holy hours  Why are ye vanish'd dear inviting shades  Why ceas'd the cheering music of your glades  Not  that  which on the surging aether floats  Or trembles in the linnet's gurgling notes  But that which gives you  Harriet  's polish'd mind  Her sense reflective and her taste refin'd  That  which your venerable Dryads love  When midst their haunts they see her graceful move  That  which adorns the clearest strongest sense  And clothes in lightest dress the thought intense  INVOCATION  Written on a very hot day in August  COOLING zephyrs haste away  Round my humid temples play  Groves and grots in pity leave  On my fainting bosom breathe  Skim as you pass your silken wings  O'er gurgling founts and glassy springs  Oh come from Greenland's icy plains  Where silver Winter constant reigns  Or from the Arctic higher fly  Thro' the chill Norwegian sky  Turn not  to Gallia's sunny vales  Nor mix with yours Italia's gales  Strait o'er the northern ocean sweep  Where pearls the frozen Naïads weep  But on high Grampia's fleecy top  Where kids the gelid herbage crop  There  zephyr touchthen with new wing  Fresh from its chilly caverns spring  Oh linger not midst England's fields  Nor taste the sweets the garden yields  Heed not our meadows' gaudy charms  But dart with vigour to my arms  ADDRESS TO TWO CANDLES  "No subject so mean that Poetry cannot elevate and render interesting"  ANON  At a  Cottage  on an eminence  ANNA MATILDA  had ordered the Candles to be removed from the Window but the Night was dark and recollecting the situation she replaced and thus addressed them  BURNlucid tapers fiercer burn  Refine each ray to purer light  Pervade the circumambient air  And pierce the closest robe of Night  Why  faintly  glow your spiral fires  Whilst Charity invokes your beams  Why inauspicious to my prayer  Still faint and fainter are your gleams  Oh think that on the distant heath  Whose canopy's a  sombre  sky  Some weary traveller may roam  No hut no guide no shelter nigh  Perhaps an aged parent tries  To find amidst the thick'ning shades  Her doubtful pathperhaps a child  Bemoans forlorn in yonder glades  Your  honest  light they need not dread  No  ignis  false instructs your ray  To guide amiss their trembling feet  Or lure them from th' intended way  No vapour gross your fulgence feeds  From  snowy wax  your flame is drawn  By virgin bees extracted pure  From ev'ry sweet that decks the lawn  The rose the violet and the thyme  That scent the Morning's dewy shower  Combin'd their aromatic gifts  And form'd ye for the present hour  Then gentle tapers brisker burn  Dart with new vigour thro' the night  Tinge ev'ry ray with brighter hues  And pour them on the wand'rer's sight  ON  SEEING THE PALETTE  OF A CELEBRATED PAINTER  THIS wild chaotic mass of every dye  Where principles of beauteous  order  lie  Is sure an emblem of the scene  When out of dark confusion sprung  The variegated orb terrene  And in the solar system hung  Soon as the mighty artist gives the sign  This formless mass as at the word divine  Shall regulate its shade and light  Harmonious move as he shall will  Its tints divide or else unite  Obedient to his powerful skill  And as the GLORIOUS VISION fills his mind  They to its plastic impulse all resign'd  Shall into prospects vast expand  Foaming in surfy billows rise  Then stretch their velvet into land  Then bid their radiance streamin skies  In cumbrous Alps ascend whose tops explore  Regions where dayey'd eagles fear to soar  Or in the soft jonquil unfold  Midst the low beauties of the vale  Her robe of imitative gold  Which loads with sweets the dancing gale  In distant forests spread th' inviting brown  Or hide with spikey furze the barren down  Then tumbling from the flinty rock  In white meanders lead the eye  And then the eye's keen search to mock  Thro' some timefretted cavern fly  Richly festoon'd in luscious purple shine  Extending o'er the slope the nect'rous vine  Or in the gaudy spheroids swell  Which the swart Indian's groves illume  Or dye the spicey nonpareil  Or the soft peach's stain assume  Yet morehe wills and from the palette starts  The form divineof soul illumin'd parts  Here springs a HEBE there a SAGE  Here HEROES from the mass break forth  There the soft LAIS of the age  From hence the CAESAR of the North  Oh wondrous science first of arts among  And do those mighty powers to thee belong  Herehere then POETRY thy numbers bring  Here MUSIC strike thy sweetly trembling string  Creative PAINTING asks th' adoring knee  Who tho' a sister call'd shall hence your Sov'reign be  THE  FUNERAL  THE paper black'd a full inch deep  At every corner seem'd to weep  The seal with fearful speed was broke  When thus the Writer sadly spoke  " Oh Charles belov'd my dear is dead  " And every bliss for ever fled  " You and your wife her constant friend  " Her fun'ral rites must now attend"  The day approach'd the solemn bell  In dismal notes rang Laura's knell  Charles and his mate in blackness clad  With rueful thoughts and faces sad  Saw her interr'dheard "  dust to dust  "  And cry'dto this all come and must  The coaches now in sad array  Pace back the mournful late trod way  Whilst floating plumes on shoulders borne  The dusty lanes and streets adorn  The widower sad alone they found  In sable length upon the ground  His consolation Charles essay'd  And many a weary moment stay'd  From Scripture cull'd a sacred store  And drain'd from heathenish learned lore  All that was ever thought or said  To prove we can't call back the dead  He sooth'd his tears at ev'ry gush  And saw at length his sorrows hush  Oh Charles James cried thou'rt very kind  This shall live long within my mind  How shall the friendship I repay  Thou'st prov'd upon this mournful day  Which tore my dearest wife away  And placed her with her kindred clay  Charles rub'd his cheek and thus replied  With head a little turn'd aside  Why dearest James thou shalt to me  Be just the friend I've been to thee  Would Fate grant that 'tis all I ask  Be  mine  the SORROW  thine  the TASK  In the following Correspondence which has occasioned much notice it has been suggested that there has been some collusionANNA MATILDA therefore declares that tho' she has lately guessed at DELLA CRUSCA she is yet uncertain as to his name and rank and she is persuaded that he cannot have the most dis tantidea of her's  The beautiful lines of the ADIEU AND RECALL struck her so forcibly that without rising from the table at which she read she answered them DELLA CRUSCA's elegant Reply surprised her into another and thus the Correspondence most unexpectedly became settled ANNA MATILDA's share in it has little to boast but she has one claim of which she is proudThat of having been the first to point out the excellence of Della Crusca if there can be merit in discerning what is so very obvious  THE  ADIEU AND RECALL  TO LOVE  Go idle Boy I quit thy pow'r  Thy couch of many a thorn and flow'r  Thy twanging bow thine arrow keen  Deceitful Beauty's timid mien  The feign'd surprize the roguish leer  The tender smile the thrilling tear  Have now no pangs no joys for me  So fare thee well for I am free  Then flutter hence on wanton wing  Or lave thee in yon lucid spring  Or take thy bev'rage from the rose  Or on  Louisa  's breast repose  I wish thee well for pleasures past  Yet bless the hour I'm free at last  But sure methinks the alter'd day  Scatters around a mournful ray  And chilling ev'ry zephyr blows  And ev'ry stream untuneful flows  No rapture swells the linnet's voice  No more the vocal groves rejoice  And e'en thy song  sweet Bird of Eve  With whom I lov'd so oft to grieve  Now scarce regarded meets my ear  Unanswer'd by a sigh or tear  No more with devious step I choose  To brush the mountain's morning dews  To drink the spirit of the breeze  Or wander midst o'erarching trees  Or woo with undisturb'd delight  The palecheek'd Virgin of the Night  That piercing thro' the leafy bow'r  Throws on the ground a silv'ry show'r  Alas is all this boasted ease  To lose each warm desire to please  No sweet solicitude to know  For others bliss for others woe  A frozen apathy to find  A sad vacuity of mind  O hasten back then idle Boy  And with thine anguish bring thy joy  Return with all thy torments here  And let me hope and doubt and fear  O rend my heart with ev'ry pain  But let me let me love again  DELLA CRUSCA  TO  DELLA CRUSCA  THE PEN  O SEIZE again thy golden quill  And with its point my bosom thrill  With magic touch explore my heart  And bid the tear of passion start  Thy golden quill APOLLO gave  Drench'd first in bright Aonia's wave  He snatch'd it flutt'ring thro' the sky  Borne on the vapour of a sigh  It fell from  Cupid  's burnish'd wing  As forcefully he drew the string  Which sent his keenest surest dart  Thro' a rebellious frozen heart  That had till then defy'd his pow'r  And vacant beat thro' each dull hour  Be worthy then the sacred loan  Seated on Fancy's airbuilt throne  Immerse it in her rainbow hues  Nor what the Godheads bid refuse  APOLLO CUPID shall inspire  And aid thee with their blended fire  The  one  poetic language give  The  other  bid thy passion live  With soft ideas fill thy lays  And crown with LOVE thy wint'ry days  ANNA MATILDA  TO  ANNA MATILDA  I KNOW thee well enchanting Maid  I've mark'd thee in the silent glade  I've seen thee on the mountain's height  I've met thee in the storms of night  I've view'd thee on the wild beach run  To gaze upon the setting sun  Then stop aghast his ray no more  To hear th' impetuous surge's roar  Hast thou not stood with rapt'rous eye  To trace the starry worlds on high  T'observe the moon's weak crescent throw  O'er hills and woods a glimm'ring glow  Or all beside some wizard stream  To watch its undulating beam  O well thy form divine I know  When youthful errors brought me woe  When all was dreary to behold  And many a bosomfriend grew cold  Thou thou unlike the summer crew  That from my adverse fortune flew  Cam'st with melodious voice to cheer  My throbbing heart and check the tear  From thee I learnt 'twas vain to scan  The low ingratitude of Man  Thou bad'st me Fancy's wilds to rove  And seek th' ecstatic bow'r of Love  When on his couch I threw me down  I saw thee weave a myrtle crown  And blend it with the shining hair  Of  her  the Fairest of the Fair  For this may ev'ry wand'ring gale  The essence of the rose exhale  And pour the fragrance on thy breast  And gently fan thy charms to rest  Soon as the purple slumbers fly  The op'ning radiance of thine eye  Strike strike again the magic lyre  With all thy pathos all thy fire  With all that sweetlywarbled grace  Which proves thee of celestial race  O then in varying colours drest  And living glory stand confest  Shake from thy locks ambrosial dew  And thrill each pulse of joy anew  With glowing ardours rouse my soul  And bid the tides of Passion roll  But think no longer in disguise  To screen thy beauty from mine eyes  Nor deign a borrow'd name to use  For well I knowthou art  the  MUSE  DELLA CRUSCA  TO  DELLA CRUSCA  THOU bidst"  my purple slumbers fly  "  Day's radiance pours upon my eye  I wakeI live the sense o'erpays  The trivial griefs of early days  What tho' the rosebud on my cheek  Hath shed its leaves which late so sleek  Spoke youth and joyand careless thought  By guilt or fear or shame unsmote  My  blooming soul  is yet in youth  Its lively sense attests the truth  O I can wander yet and taste  The beauties of the flow'ry waste  The nightingale's deep swell can feel  Whilst from my lids the soft drops steal  Rapt gaze upon the gemdeck'd night  And mark the clear moon's silent flight  Whilst the slow river's crumpled wave  Repeats the quiv'ring beams she gave  Nor yet the pencil strives in vain  To wake upon the canvas plain  All the strong passions of the mind  Or hint the sentiment refin'd  To its sweet magic yet I bow  As when Youth deck'd my polish'd brow  The chisel's feath'ry touch to trace  Thro' the nerv'd form or soften'd grace  Is lent me still Still I admire  And kindle at the Poet's fire  My torch at  Della Crusca's  light  And distant follow his superior flight  O Time  since these are left me still  Of  lesser thefts  e'en take thy fill  Yes steal the lustre from my eye  And bid the soft Carnation fly  My tresses sprinkle with thy snow  Which boasted once the  auburn glow    Warp the slim form that was ador'd  By him so lov'd my  bosom  's LORD  But leave me when all these you steal  The mind to  taste  the nerve to  feel  ANNA MATILDA  TO  ANNA MATILDA  AND art thou then alas like me  OFFSPRING  of frail mortality  Must ruthless Time's rude touch efface  Each lovely feature's varying grace  And must tow'rds earth that form incline  And e'en those eyes forbear to shine  Yet when with icy hand he throws  Amongst thine  auburn locks  his snows  The freezing influence ne'er shall dart  To chill thy warmlybeating heart  And scorning Death's oblivious hour  Thou shalt exultbeyond his pow'r  Methinks as Passion drives along  As frantic grown I feel thy Song  Eager I'd traverse LYBIA's plain  The tawny Lion's dread domain  To meet thee there nor flagging  Fear    Should ever on my cheek appear  For e'en the Forest's King obeys  Majestic  WOMAN'  s potent gaze    Or left on some resourceless shore  Where neverceasing billows roar  Which teeming clouds and heavy hail  And furious hurricanes assail  Far to the Polewhile half the year  On Ebon throne sits NIGHT severe  And to her solitary court  Seafowl and monsters fierce resort  E'en  there  MATILDA there with thee  Impending horrors all should flee  Thy lustre of poetic ray  Should wake an artificial day  Sure thou wast never doom'd to know  What pangs from care and danger flow  But fairest scenes thy thoughts employ  And Art and Science bring thee joy  The quick'ning sense the throb divine  Fancy and Feeling all are thine  'Tis thine by blushing Summer led  A show'r of roses round thee shed  To hie thee forth at Morn's advance  In wild excess of rapt'rous trance  And see the Sun's proud deluge stream  In copious tides of golden beam  While faint his  SisterOrb  on high  Fades to a vapour of the sky  When gradual evening comes to hide  In sabling shades CREATION'  s pride    When heaving hills and forests drear  And less'ning towns but scarce appear  While the last ling'ring western glow  Hangs on the lucid lake below  Then trivial joys I deem forgot  Thou lov'st to seek the humble cot  To scatter Comfort's balm around  And heal pale Poverty's deep wound  Drive sickness from the languid bed  Raise the lorn Widow's drooping head  Render the newmade Mother blest  And snatch the Infant to thy breast  O ANNA then if true thou say  Thy radiant beauties steal away  Yet shall I never fail to find  Eternal beauties in thy mind  To those I offer up my vows  And Love which Virtue's self allows  Unknown again thou art ador'd  As once by him thy "  bosom's Lord  "  DELLA CRUSCA  ELEGY  Written on the PLAIN OF FONTENOY  CHILL blows the blast and Twilight's dewy hand  Draws in the West her dusky veil away  A deeper shadow steals along the land  And NATURE muses at the DEATH of DAY  Near this bleak Waste no friendly mansion rears  Its walls where Mirth and social joys resound  But each sad object melts the soul to tears  While Horror treads the scatter'd bones around  As thus alone and comfortless I roam  Wet with the drizling show'r I sigh sincere  I cast a fond look tow'rds my native home  And think what valiant BRITONS perish'd here  Yes the time was nor very far the date  When carnage here her crimson toil began  When Nations' Standards wav'd in threat'ning state  And Man the murd'rer met the murd'rer Man  For WAR is MURDER tho' the voice of Kings  Has styl'd it Justice styl'd it Glory too  Yet from worst motives fierce Ambition springs  And there fix'd Prejudice is all we view  But sure 'tis Heaven's immutable decree  For thousands ev'ry age in fight to fall  Some NAT'RAL CAUSE prevails we cannot see  And that is FATE which we  Ambition  call  O let th' aspiring Warrior think with grief  That as produc'd by CHYMIC art refin'd  So glitt'ring CONQUEST from the  laurel leaf  Extracts a GEN'RAL POISON for Mankind  Here let him wander at the midnight hour  These morbid rains these gelid gales to meet  And mourn like me the ravages of Pow'r  And feel like me that Vict'ry is defeat  Nor deem ye vain that e'er I mean to swell  My feeble Verse with many a sounding Name  Of such the mercenary Bard may tell  And call such dreary desolation Fame  The genuine Muse removes the thin disguise  That cheats the World whene'er she deigns to sing  And full as meritorious to her eyes  Seems the Poor Soldier as the Mighty King  Alike I shun in labour'd strain to show  How BRITAIN more than triumph'd tho' she fled  Where  LOUIS  stood where stalk'd the column slow  I turn from these and DWELL UPON THE DEAD  Yet much my beating breast respects the brave  Too well I love them not to mourn their fate  Why should they seek for greatness in the grave  Their hearts are nobleand in life they're great  Nor think 'tis but in War the Brave excell  TO VALOUR EV'RY VIRTUE IS ALLIED  Here faithful friendship 'mid the Battle fell  And Love true Love in bitter anguish died  Alas the solemn slaughter I retrace  That checks life's current circling thro' my veins  Bath'd in moist sorrow many a beauteous face  And gave a grief perhaps that still remains  I can no morean agony too keen  Absorbs my senses and my mind subdues  Hard were that heart which here could beat serene  Or the just tribute of a pang refuse  But lo thro' yonder op'ning clouds afar  Shoots the bright PLANET's sanguinary ray  That bears thy name FICTITIOUS LORD OF WAR  And with red lustre guides my lonely way  Then FONTENOY farewell Yet much I fear  Wherever chance my course compells to find  Discord and Bloodthe thrilling sounds I hear  " The noise of battle hurtles in the wind"  From barb'rous  Turkey  to  Britannia  's shore  Opposing int'rests into rage increase  Destruction rears her sceptre tumults roar  Ah where shall hapless man repose in peace  DELLA CRUSCA  STANZAS  TO DELLA CRUSCA  HUSH'D be each ruder notesoft silence spread  With ermine hand thy cobweb robe around  Attention pillow my reclining head  Whilst eagerly I catch the golden sound  Ha What a tone was that which floating near  Seem'd Harmony's full soul  whose  is the lyre  Which seizing thus on my enraptur'd ear  Chills with its force yet melts me with its fire  Ah dull of heart thy Minstrel's touch not know  What Bard but DELLA CRUSCA boasts such skill  From him alone those melting notes can flow  He only knows adroitly thus to trill  Well have I left the Groves which sighing wave  Amidst November's blast their naked arms  Whilst their red leaves fall flutt'ring to their grave  And give again to dust May's vernal charms  Well have I left the airembosom'd hills  Where sprightly Health in verdant buskin plays  Forsaken fallow meads and circling mills  And thymedress'd heaths where the soft flock yet strays  Obscuring smoak and air impure I greet  With the coarse din that Trade and Folly form  For here the Muse's Son again I meet  I catch  his  notes amidst the vulgar storm  His notes now bear me pensive to the Plain  Cloth'd by a verdure drawn from Britain's heart  Whose heroes bled superior to their pain  Sunk crown'd with glory and contemn'd the smart  Soft as he leads me round th' ensanguin'd fields  The laurel'd shades forsake their grassy tomb  The bursting sod its palid inmate yields  And o'er th' immortal waste their spirits roam  Obedient to the Muse the acts revive  Which Time long past had veil'd from mortal ken  Embattled squadrons rush as when alive  And  shadowy  falchions gleam o'er  shadowy  men  Ah who art thou who thus with frantic air  Fly'st fearless to support that bleeding youth  Binds his deep gashes with thy glowing hair  And diest beside him to attest thy truth  " His Sister I an orphan'd pair we griev'd  " For Parents long at rest within the grave  " By a false Guardian of our wealth bereav'd  " The little ALL parental care could save  " Chill look'd the world and chilly grew our hearts  " Oh where shall Poverty expect a smile  " Gross lawless Love assumed its ready arts  " And all beset was I with Fraud and Guile  " My Henry sought the war and drop'd the tears  " Of love fraternal as he bade farewell  " But fear soon made me rise  above  my fears  " I follow'dand Fate tolls our mutual knell"  Chaste Maiden rest and brighter spring the green  That decorates the turf thy bloom will feed  And oh in softest mercy 'twas I ween  To worth like thine a Brother's grave's decreed  The dreadful shriek of Death now darts around  The hollow winds repeat each tortur'd sigh  Deep bitter groans still deeper groans resound  Whilst Fathers Brothers Lovers Husbands die  Turn from this spot blest Bard thy mental eye  To hamlets cities empires bend its beam  'Twill there such multiplying deaths descry  That all before thee'll but an abstract seem  Why waste thy tears o'er this contracted Plain  The sky which canopies the sons of breath  Sees the whole Earth one scene of mortal pain  The vast the universal BED OF DEATH  Where  do not Husbands Fathers dying moan  Where  do not Mothers Sisters Orphans weep  Where  is not heard the last expiring groan  Or the deep throttle of the deathful Sleep  If as Philosophy doth often muse  A state of war is natural state to man  Battle's the SICKNESS bravery would choose  Noblest DISEASE in Nature's various plan  Let vulgar souls stoop to the fever's rage  Or slow beneath pale atrophy depart  With Gout and Scrophula  weak  variance wage  Or sink with sorrow cank'ring at the heart  These be to common Minds th' unwish'd decree  The FIRM select an illness more sublime  By languid pains scorn their high souls to free  But seek the Sword's swift edge and spurn at Time  ANNA MATILDA  TO  ANNA MATILDA  ON the seashore with folded arms I stood  The Sun just sinking shot a level ray  Luxuriant crimson glow'd upon the flood  And the curl'd surf was ting'd with golden spray  Far of I faintly track'd the feath'ry sail  When thy sweet numbers caught my yielded ear  Borne on the bosom of the flutt'ring gale  They struck my heartand rous'd me to a tear  Yet flow'd no bitter anguish from mine eye  A while remembrance left my wayward state  And the soft cadence of thy warbled sigh  Pour'd healing balm into the wounds of Fate  What tho' grim Winter's desolating frown  The wild waves uproar when rough  Eurus  blows  The tangled forest and the desart down  Be all the solace DELLA CRUSCA knows  Yet from MATILDA's pure celestial fire  One ruby spark shall to his gloom be given  Lur'd by its light his fancy may aspire  And catch a ray of blissa glimpse of Heaven  Vain in the morn of life and thoughtless too  He rush'd impetuous as strong passion drove  But soon each flatt'ring prospect fled his view  Deceived by Friendship much but more by Love  Yes he has lov'd to Transport's dire excess  Has felt the potent eye inflict the wound  Has felt the female voice each pulse oppress  And grown a breathless statue at the sound  But why recall the moments that are fled  For ever fled like yonder sweeping blast  With Love each active principle is dead  And all except its sad regret is past  Ah had he met thee in this happier hour  Ere yet he languish'd in the gripe of Care  Thy minstrel  then had fondly own'd thy pow'r  Thy minstrel  then might have escap'd Despair  O diff'rent lot for he who daily grieves  Then with thy beauty blest and gen'rous mind  Had not like sallow Autumn's falling leaves  Been shrunk alas and scatter'd in the wind  Haply he had not roam'd for ling'ring years  On many a rugged Alp and foreign shore  He ne'er had known the cause of all his tears  The cherish'd cause that bids himhope no more  He would have led thee with attentive gaze  Where the brown hamlet's neighb'ring shades retire  Have hung entranc'd upon thy living lays  And swept with  feebler  hand a  kindred  lyre  While the  dear Songstress  had melodious stole  O'er ev'ry sense and charm'd each nerve to rest  Thy Bard  in silent ecstacy of soul  Had strain'd the  dearer Woman  to his breast  Or had she said that  War's the worthiest grave    He would have felt his proud heart burn the while  Have dar'd perhaps to rush among the brave  Have gain'd perhaps the gloryof a smile  And 'tis most true while Time's relentless hand  With sickly grasp drags  others  to the tomb  The Soldier scorns to wait the dull command  But springs impatient to a nobler doom  Tho' on the plain  he  lies outstretch'd and pale  Without one friend his stedfast eyes to close  Yet on his honour'd corse shall many a gale  Waft the moist fragrance of the weeping rose  O'er that dread spot the melancholy Moon  Shall pause a while a sadder beam to shed  And starry Night amidst her awful noon  Sprinkle light dews upon his hallow'd head  There too the solitary Bird shall swell  With longdrawn melody her plaintive throat  While distant Echo from responsive cell  Shall oft with fading force return the note  Such recompense be Valour's due alone  To me no proffer'd meed must e'er belong  To me who trod the vale of life unknown  Whose proudest boast was but an idle song  DELLA CRUSCA  TO  DELLA CRUSCA  I HATE the tardy Elegiac lay  Choose me a measure jocund as the day  Such days as near the ides of June  Meet the Lark's elab'rate tune  When his downy fringed breast  Ambitious on a cloud to rest  He soars aloft and from his gurgling throat  Darts to the earth the piercing note  Which softly falling with the dews of morn  That bless the scented pink and snowy thorn  Expands upon the Zephyr's wing  And wakes the burnish'd finch and linnet sweet to sing  And be thy lines irregular and free  Poetic chains should fall before such Bards as thee  Scorn the dull laws that pinch thee round  Raising about thy verse a mound  O'er which thy Muse so lofty dares not bound  Bid her in verse meand'ring sport  Her footsteps quick or long or short  Just as her various impulse wills  Scorning the frigid square which her fine fervor chills  And in thy verse meand'ring wild  Thou who art FANCY's  favourite Child    May'st sweetly paint the long past hour  When the slave of Cupid's power  Thou could'st the tear of rapture weep  And feed on Agony and banish Sleep  Ha  didst  thou favour'd mortal taste  All that adorns our life's dull waste  Hast  THOU known Love's enchanting pain  Its hopes its woes  and yet complain  Thy senses at a voice been lost  Thy mad'ning soul in tumults tost  Ecstatic wishes fire thy brain  These hast thou known  and yet complain  Thou then deserv'st ne'er more to FEEL  Thy nerves be rigid hence as steel  Their fine vibrations all destroy'd  Thy future days a tasteless void  Ne'er shalt thou know again to sigh  Or on a soft idea die  Ne'er on a  recollection  gasp  Thy arms the airdrawn charmer never grasp  Vapid Content her poppies round thee strew  Whilst to the bliss of TASTE thou bidst adieu  To vulgar  comforts  be thou hence confin'd  And the shrunk bays be from thy brow untwin'd  Thy statue torn from Cupid's hallow'd nitch  But in return thou shalt be dull and rich  The Muses hence disown thy rebel lay  But thou in  Aldermanic  gown their scorn repay  Crimson'd and furr'd the highest honours dare  And on thy laurels treada PLUMP LORD MAYOR  ANNA MATILDA  INVOCATION  TO HORROR  FAR be remov'd each painted scene  What is to  me  the sapphire sky  What is to  me  the earth's soft dye  Or fragrant vales which sink between  Those velvet hills yes there I see  Why do those beauties burst on me  Pearl dropping groves bow to the sun  Seizing his beams bright rivers run  That dart redoubled day  Hope ye vain scenes to catch the mind  To torpid sorrow all resign'd  Or bid my heart be gay  False are those hopesI turnI fly  Where no enchantment meets the eye  Or soft ideas stray  HORROR I call thee from the mould'ring tower  The murky churchyard and forsaken bower  Where 'midst unwholesome damps  The vap'ry gleamy lamps  Of  ignes fatui  shew the thickwove night  Where morbid MELANCHOLY sits  And weeps and sings and raves by fits  And to her bosom strains the fancied sprite  Or if amidst the arctic gloom  Thou toilest at thy sable loom  Forming the hideous phantoms of Despair  Instant thy grisly labours leave  With raven wing the concave cleave  Where floats selfborne the dense nocturnal air  Oh bear me to th' impending cliff  Under whose brow the dashing skiff  Beholds  Thee  seated on thy rocky throne  There 'midst the shrieking wild wind's roar  Thy influence HORROR I'll adore  And at thy magic touch congeal to stone  Oh hide the Moon's obtrusive orb  The gleams of ev'ry star absorb  And let

thunders long and loud  And light'nings flash upon the deep below  Let the  expiring Seaman's cry    The  Pilot  's agonizing sigh  Mingle and in the dreadful chorus flow  HORROR far back thou dat'st thy reign  Ere KINGS th'  historic page  could stain  With records black or deeds of lawless power  Ere empires  Alexanders  curst  Or Faction mad'ning  Caesars  nurst  The frighted World receiv'd thy awful dower  Whose pen JEHOVAH's self inspir'd  He who in eloquence attir'd  Led  Israel's squadrons  o'er the earth  Grandly terrific paints thy birth  Th' ALMIGHTY 'midst his fulgent seat on high  Where glowing  Seraphs  round his footstool fly  Beheld the wanton cities of the plain  With acts of deadly name his laws disdain  He gave th' irrevocable sign  Which mark'd to man the hate divine  And sudden from the starting sky  The Angels of his wrath bid fly  Then HORROR thou presided'st o'er the whole  And fill'd and rapt each selfaccusing soul  Thou did'st ascend to guide the burning

 In some clear lake whose fascinating face  Lures the soft willow to its pure embrace  Or if beneath the gelid rock  Thy smiles all human sorrows mock  Where'er thou art in earth or air  Oh come and chase the  fiend  DESPAIR  Have I not mark'd thee on the green  Roving by  vulgar  eyes unseen  Have I not watch'd thy lightsome dance  When Evening's soften'd glows advance  Dear Goddess yes and

 when bless'd with thee in vain  Wan  Jealousy  's empoisoning tooth  And  Love  which feeds upon our youth  And holy  Friendship  's broken tie  Ne'er dim the lustre of thy eye  For thee it is all Nature blooms  For thee the Spring new charms assumes  Nor  vainly  flings her blossoms round  Nor  vainly  bids her groves resound  Her music colours odours all are thine  To thee her months their richest gifts consign  To thee the morn is bright and sweet the ray  That marks the progress of the sinking day  Each change is grateful to thy soul  For its  fine taste  no woes control  The powers

from Pain  And would'st thou then her torpid ease  Her listless apathy to know  Renounce the magic POW'R to PLEASE  And lose the LUXURY of WOE  Why does thy stream of sweetest song  In many a wild maze wind along  Foam on the Mountain's murm'ring side  Or thro' the vocal covert glide  Or among fairy meadows steal  It is because thy HEART can FEEL  Alas if Peace must be unknown  Till ev'ry nerve is turn'd to stone  Till not a teardrop wets the eye  Nor throbs the breast for Sorrow's sigh  O may I never find relief  But PERISH in the PANG of GRIEF  Think not I reason thus my Fair  A stranger

scarce can check the smile of Scorn  When those the VULGAR call the GREAT  Bend the important brow of state  And strive a consequence to find  By seeming more than Humankind  Well let them strut their hour away  Till grinning Death demand his prey  Meanwhile my ANNA let us rove  The scented vale the bending grove  Mix our hot tears with evening dews  And live for FRIENDSHIP and the MUSE  Yes let us hasten hand in hand  Where the blue billows lave the land  And as they quick recoiling fly  Send on the surf a length'ned sigh  That strikes the soul with truth sublime  As 'twere the whisp'ring TONGUE of TIME  For thus our short Life's ebbing day  Murmurs awhile and hastes away  Or let us seek the mould'ring wall  Or some lone Abbey's Gothic Hall  Recline upon the kneeworn stone  And catch the North Wind's dismal moan  That 'midst his sorrows seems to boast  Of many a gallant vessel lost  Friends and Lovers sunk in death  By the fury of his breath  What tho' at the  imagin'd Tale    Thy alter'd cheek be sadly pale  Ne'er can such SYMPATHY annoy  For 'tis the price of dearest JOY  When far off the Night Storm flies  Let us ponder on the SKIES  Where million stars are ever roll'd  Which yet our weak eyes dare behold  Adore the SELFEXISTING CAUSE  That gives to each its sep'rate laws  That when th' impetuous Comet runs  Athwart a wilderness of Suns  Tells it what mandate to obey  Nor ever wander from its way  Till back it hasten whence 'twas brought  Beyond the boundaries of Thought  Let not the studious Seer reply  "  Attraction regulates the Sky  "  And lends each Orb the secret force  "  That urges on or checks its course  "  Or with his Orrery expound  Creation's vainly fancied round  Ah quit thy toil presumptuous Sage  Destroy thy calculating page  No more on Second

circle we can trace  In the abyss of time and space  Tho' LEARNING has its limits got  The feelings of the soul have not  Their vast excursions find no end  And RAPTURE needs not comprehend  'Tis true we're ign'rant how the Earth  Wakes the first principles of birth  With vegetative moisture feeds  To diff'rent purpose diff'rent seeds  Gives to the Rose such balmy sweet  Or fills the golden ear of Wheat  Paints the ripe Peach with velvet bloom  Or weaves the thick Wood's mingling bloom  YET we can wander in the bow'r  Can taste the fragrance of the flow'r  Drink the rich fruit's nectareous

her perfume on the day  Thy light'ning Pen 'tis thus I greet  Fearless its subtile point I meet  Ne'er shall its spells my sad heart move  From the calm state it vows to love  All other bliss I've proved is vain  All other bliss is dash'd with pain  My waist with myrtles has been bound  MY BROW WITH LAURELS HAS BEEN CROWN'D  LOVE has sigh'd hopeless at my feet  LOVE on my couch has pour'd each sweet  All these I've known and now I fly  With thee INDIFFERENCE to die  Nor is thy gift "  dull torpid ease  "  The Mind's quick powers that dost not freeze  No blest by  Thee  the soul expands  And

the Erratic runs  And gaze on DELLA CRUSCA's Suns  In some new Orb can meet "  his starry mail  "  And him on earth unknown in Heaven with transport hail  ANNA MATILDA  TO  ANNA MATILDA  NOR will I more of Fate complain  For I have liv'd to feel thy strain  To feel its sunlike force divine  Swift darting through the clouds of woe  Shoot to my soul a sainted glow  Yet yet MATILDA spare to shine  One moment be the blaze supprest  Lest from this clod my spirit spring  And borne by Zephyrs' trembling wing  Seek a  new Heaven  upon thy BREAST  But say does calm INDIFFERENCE dwell  On the low mead or mountain swell  Or at grey Evening's solemn gloom  Bend her bosom to the tomb  Or when the weak dawn's orient rose  In silv'ry foliage deck'd appears  Tell me if perchance  she  goes  To the fresh garden's proud array  Where doubtful of the coming day  Each drooping flow'ret sheds translucent tears  Ah tell me tell me where  For thou shalt find me  there    Like her own son in vestment pure  With deep disguise of smile secure  So shall I once thy form descry  For once hold converse with thine eye  Vain is the thought for at thy sight  Soon as thy potent voice were found  Could I conceal the vast delight  Could I be tranquil at the sound  Could I repress quick Rapture's start  Or hide the bursting of my heart  Let but thy lyre impatient seize  Departing Twilight's filmy breeze  That winds th' enchanting chords among  In ling'ring labyrinth of song  Anon the amorous  Bird of Woe  Shall steal the tones that quiv'ring flow  And with them sooth the sighing woods  And with them charm the slumb'ring floods  Till all exhausted by the lay  He hang in silence on the spray  Drop to his idle flow'r beneath  And 'midst her blushes cease to breathe  Warn'd by his Fate 'twere surely well  To shun the fascinating spell  Nor still presumptuous dare to fling  My rude hand o'er the sounding string  As though I fondly would aspire  To match MATILDA's heavenly fire  Yet may I sometimes far remote  Hear the lov'd cadence of her note  And though  the Laurel  I resign  O may  the bliss of  TASTE  be mine  DELLA CRUSCA  The following was not composed from an idea that enough had not been said on the subject of INDIFFERENCEit was hastily written merely to let DELLA CRUSCA know that he was GUESS'D ATbut the line which would to him have particularly pointed that out was when given in The WORLD alter'dit is now printed as originally written For its many careless passages ANNA MATILDA begs this apology may be accepted that she wrote it literally whilst sitting for her portraitand whilst the sublimity of Egyptian groves Zenobia's desart Confucious Marc Antony c c had their ideas continually broken in upon with "SMILE A LITTLE""MORE TO THE RIGHT" "NOW LOOK UP" and so forth Both the poetry and the painting have suffer'd for thisthe one has been less happy the other less correct  "  Does calm Indifference dwell  "  On the low mead or mountain swell  "  Oh tell me where  "  For

they feel when DELLA CRUSCA sings  Alas thou'rt gone and to my straining eye  Thy Bark seems buoyant on the distant sky  See in the clouds its mast it proudly laves  Scorning the aid of Ocean's humble waves  Well may it soar and bear aloft the prize  Whose verse immortal links him to the skies  Well may it scorn rough  Neptune  's rocky way  Which bears the Genius of the GOD OF DAY  And now MATILDA bind thy lyre  With cypress wreathes the lambent fire  Thou kindled'st at his fervid rays  Can gleam no morethy future days  Lost to the Muses and to Taste  Each torpid hour will joyless waste  In

guide where still with sweeter note  Than flow'd from  Petrarch  's tuneful throat  On  Laura  's grave he pour'd the lay  Amidst the sighs of sinking day  Then point where on the sod his tear  Fell from its chrystal source so clear  That there my mingling tear may sink  And the same dust its moisture drink  Thus dying Swans are said to sing  And their last breath in numbers fling  O'er the dear liquid shining plains  Which nurs'd their joys and nurs'd their pains  Like them my Muse pines fast away  And this her last her closing day  When one blest word her lips hath seal'd  In lasting silence she'll be veil'd  Expiring still her note's the same  She murmurs DELLA CRUSCA's  name    The SACRED WORD ye heard it spoke  Her Book is clos'dher Lyre is broke  ANNA MATILDA  A  TALE  FOR JEALOUSY  A Recent Event in CATALONIA  LOUD shriek'd the wind hoarse struck the hour  When from his couch  Alphonso  rose  Bedeck'd with gold his splendid bower  Gold  had his couch but not  repose  The Night sat brooding on the hill  Beneath the sable rivers roll'd  Not  glist'ring  now the tinkling rill  Its stream opaque its spirit cold  His chamber long with restless feet  The Lord  Alphonso  travers'd o'er  Here once he tasted slumbers sweet  But slumber sweet he knows no more  His rous'd domestics strait obey  The signal of their Lord unloved  Their torches flash a second day  As thro' the costly rooms they moved  His favourite from th' obsequious train  Was to his inmost closet led  There heard confess'd the am'rous pain  Which tore him from his midnight bed  Oh thou wert near  Alphonso  cries  When in the progress late we made  Gonsalvo  's daughter in our eyes  Made every other virgin fade  Her noble mien her blushes mild  The burnish of her tresses bright  Her agebut just no longer Child  Her rosy mouth her graceful height  All these have in my timeworn heart  Lighted a youthful am'rous fire  I sink beneath the poignant smart  I faint with eager strong desire  Oft did I try her soul to melt  But ign'rant she of Cupid's pow'r  His ecstacies she never felt  But now is come her fated hour  With flames illicit I essay'd  To touch her iced unwaken'd heart  Let Hymen sooth the bashfull maid  She'll  waken'd  play a softer part  Strait to her father's speed thy way  The fleetest mules with haste prepare  And ere tomorrow scants his day  Thou'lt reach the village of my fair  These pearls these di'monds speak my truth  Woo her with  treasures  to my arms  When love no longer boasts of youth  Riches may plead their meaner charms  Oh how unlike the rapturous hour  When love is bought by love alone  When a soft look a touch a flower  Is prized beyond IND's brightest stone  But go and to her parents bear  Thy Lord's designshis hopes unfold  Plead with due force his meaning fair  And in thy promises be bold  Much more the Lord  Alphonso  spoke  His servant's mind the whole retains  Whose lashes soon the mules provoke  The mules skim o'er the distant plains  Th' awaken'd night with streaks of gold  Her jetty robes begun to lace  Her drowsy car far off she roll'd  The blithe Sun urging to the race  And ere his wheels had run behind  The western mountain's giddy slope  Julia  with meekness all resign'd  Had listen'd to  Alphonso  's hope  Not so resign'd but that her thought  Recoil'd at such unequal love  Till by parental wisdom taught  She learn'd to bear and then approve  The Sire attends his darling child  For so  Alphonso  's pride allows  And with the transport almost wild  Saw her receive a Grandee's vows  He saw that form where speaking grace  Gave soul to beauty most refin'd  The robe of dignity embrace  By taste magnificent design'd  Her hair which floated o'er her dress  A dress which to be  seen  demands  Its rich luxuriance to repress  They tie in folds with diamond bands  But the soft curls which hap'ly fell  Upon her bosom's heaving snow  Were suffer'd there unbound to dwell  And spread their wavy golden glow  Thus the fond parent saw her rove  Thro' gaudy halls and rooms of state  Whilst humble trains at distance wait  And from her nod receive their fate  Succinct the time in which such joy  Around his aged heart might play  Bitter oh bitter the all  y  And set full soon is Pleasure's day  For Lord  Alphonso  names the hour  When he the sumptuous dome must quit  And seek again the humble bower  For birth like his a mansion fit  Tells him to take a last farewell  Of her more dear then sense or light  Bids him ne'er hope again to dwell  Where filial  Julia  bless'd his sight  His daughter overwhelm'd with woe  The haughty cruel order hears  She sees her mournful parent go  And bathes his last steps with her tears  Now slow and sadden'd rolls the time  Which late flew rapid with delight  Heedless is she of Morning's prime  Nor hails the soft approach of Night  Her only solace was to roam  Midst the deep wood's embosom'd calm  Where distant from her gaudy home  Meek solitude bestow'd its balm  There on a river's fringy side  Which snatch'd her breath as stealing by  She'd watch its curl'd unequal glide  And swell with her's the zephyr's sigh  Mark with what truth it objects drew  When  ruffling zephyr  ceas'd to breathe  Its surface polish'd to the view  A  phantom forest  underneath  Two drooping willows there display'd  Their foliage to the painting wave  Which in their pensive green array'd  Would still their jutting bare roots lave  These by her hands in garlands dress'd  She'd sometimes chide the low bent branch  Which would its blooming fragrant vest  Upon th' escaping river launch  Thus was she one bright eve employ'd  Whilst carols sad her sweet voice sung  Evening's own bird her note enjoy'd  When from its shades a soldier sprung  His form like that  Apollo  wears  When from his bow the swift dart sings  Or when the discus thro' the air  With equal force and grace he flings  Martial his step his beamy eye  Bright as fair  Julia  's own appears  Strait to each others arms they fly  They mingle joythey mingle tears  'Twas  Julia  's brother whom she saw  'Twas  Julia  whom her brother press'd  Both dear by Nature's dearest law  For twins they were who thus caress'd  From  Calpe  's glorious rock he came  Immortal monument decreed  Of English ELLIOT's laurel'd name  Where English heroes oft shall bleed  And there his blood did  Gusman  shed  Amongst the boldest ever found  By sacred thirst of honour led  Nor shun'd the deaths that flew around  But when bright Peace her silver flute  Had sounded thro' wide Europe's skies  And when the voice of war was mute  Sped by fond duty home he flies  There he first learn'd his sister's fate  How elevatedand how curst  Heard that amidst her brilliant state  Her heart consuming sorrow nurst  Her husband's tyrant law reveal'd  No dear relation to behold  Oblig'd him thus in shades conceal'd  His sister to his heart to fold  And oft he mourn'd her cruel lot  And oft he dried her tears away  When from the interesting spot  They each were warn'd by closing day  Adieu my  Gusman Julia  cries  Yet let me see thee once again  Tomorrow bless thy sister's eyes  Then seek our dear paternal plain  From forth my little treasur'd hoard  Fond tokens to my mother bear  No miser is my cruel Lord  And gifts like these I well can spare  Gusman  with pure fraternal love  Kiss'd either beauteous  fading  cheek  Vowing when Morn shou'd light the grove  In its mild haunts her steps he'd seek  Now Evening hung its silv'ry dews  On every shrub that deck'd the glades  And fainter scents the flowers effuse  As loth to greet with sweets her shades  Oft had fair  Julia  linger'd there  In hours like theseand traced the beam  Which sent from Luna's brilliant sphere  Shot thro' the wood a  shiver'd  gleam  Mark'd how each sound stole soft away  As gliding off to shores more bright  Bribed by the gaudy tumid day  To fly the doveeyed tender night  By  Julia  these are all forgot  For pleasure hath her soul suffused  Blind to the beauties of the spot  She deigns not now to be  amused    Braced with young joy the sportive fawn  Pursues her dam with motion fleet  Regardless of the sprinkled lawn  That weaves its flowers around her feet  So speeds the fair one to her home  Whose towers return the moon's broad glare  Whilst to point out the distant dome  They flash their gold vanes thro' the air  On her soft pillow soon reclined  Round her the slumbers spun their veil  And o'er her placid gentle mind  The softest dreams their phantoms steal  At Morning's dawn her Lord commands  Her placid slumbers must be broke  He grasp'd in his her trembling hands  He led her forth but never spoke  And oh these horrid sounds she cried  Those piteous shrieks which tear the ear  With terror struck she faintly sigh'd  And sunk at length o'erpower'd with fear  He dragg'd her on the screams of pain  More piercing as they nearer grow  Left her scarce power to sustain  Her crimson life's unequal flow  There wretch behold  Alphonso  cried  As wide he threw the grating gate  There feast thy loose adulterous eyes  See there thy paramour's just fate  There stretch'd upon the racking wheel  She saw her brother's tortur'd form  From his torn flesh the jagged steel  Bad rush the blood with life yet warm  She  saw  but oh she spoke no more  The agony too fierce to bear  Groaning she sunk upon the floor  And breath'd her spirit on the air  Sister the writhing  Gusman  said  Oh Sister pleadthen swoon'd with pain  On his gash'd bosom sunk his head  His limbs convuls'd the cords still strain  Alphonso  when he heard the sound  Leapt sudden to the deathful wheel  With eager haste the youth's unbound  And stern  Alphonso  learns to feel  He raves he sinks he strikes his breast  But oh the guilty deed is past  The victims pure are now at rest  Thy  tortures shall for ever last  Vain is all art for life no more  Can lift their pulse their cheeks can paint  Thou'st freed their souls they quit the shore  Each seeks its Goda murder'd Saint  There tyrant lie and let the fangs  Of deep remorse thy bosom tear  Each wak'ning morn awake new pangs  Teach thee to pity and despair  ANNA MATILDA  TO THOSE WHO READ  THE following little Tract printed carefully from the Manuscript of the once famous  Sir William Waller  is considered as a curiosity worthy of being given to the publicIt contains the  memoranda  and  reflections  of a man who had a considerable share in forming the fate of England at a time when the strong convulsions of its state arrested the attention of Europe and of the world  Sir William Waller  was a member of the House of Commons and MajorGeneral of the Parliament army It appears from  WHITLOCK  that he was a man of great consideration in the army and with the public  Oliver Cromwell  served under himthe  KING  feared himthe  PARLIAMENT  depended on him  The purity of his intentions and the uprightnes  of his principlesthe transcript before you wil  sufficiently establishit is a  mental mirror  in which you behold the features of the writer's mind as distinctly as a looking glass reflects to a young beauty her cheek of roses and her eye of fire▪ That he was popular as to courage and resolution is plain from a formal petition sent to Parliament by the inhabitants of Portsmouth praying that  Sir William Waller  might be made their Governor  That he had a mind capable of the tenderest impressions and alive to all the charms of love appears from this that he never lived unmarried Three times he exulted in the flowery hymeneal chain and speaks of each Lady with exalted fondness and affection But those alas were days in which the  connubial passion  was the only one tolerated  Of  WALLER Hume  begins to speak in the following words  "  In the year  Sir William Waller  began to distinguish himself among the Generals of the army Active and indesatigable in his operations rapid and enterprising he was fitted by his genius to the nature of war  "  Vol VI p  It has been lately so much the taste to read the ana of celebrated men that the Editor of  these  is persuaded their being combined with the effusions of her own idle hours will not render them unwelcome To the public perhaps there is no occasion for apology but towards the writer himself she has some consciousness of delinquency The brave General who wore himself out in campaigns cased in armour and peeping half his life through an iron vizor thought of nothing  less  probably than of turning authoryet it happens that after he has been at rest with his tumultuous ancestors I hope they will forgive my guessing at their characters almost a century and his military and moral character long ago decided on he is now made to hold up his hand at the literary bar to be tried by his Critics and his Country  To his critics and countrymen it may be observed that if they have an appetite for anecdote the following pages will not tend much to satisfy it They are filled with the recollections of a man who at the close of a busy life thought it  time  to recollect himself and who recollects  only  about himself In the retrospect his imminent dangers and hairbreadth 'scapes light up his gratitude to Heaven and make his little book rather a compendium of piety than a register of events A piety not much  differing from that which has provoked our sneers at the posthumous works of the great  Johnson  but then  he  was a scholar and a philosopher and his piety in course very much unlike other people's What you are now offer'd is the piety of a Generalwe have many Generals and they can answer for the similitude  In a wordthis peculiar little volume is presented not to the world as an amusement but to the  curious  as a  medal  A medal struck at an era when the events of this country were  MIGHTY  and when the characters of men were  GRAND  when every action was on an enlarged scale and in high reliefwhen the kingdom like Sir Joshua's infant Hercules was struggling between the two deadly serpents which assailed its vitalitythe  TYRANNY OF THE COMMONWEALTH  and the  PREROGATIVE OF THE CROWN  The  internal evidence  the book carries with it is so strong that it is judged not necessary to say one word on its authenticity But it is necessary to say that besides the pages suppressed mentioned in the conclusion there has been an elision of one entire section under the head  OF PERILS BY WATER  a part likewise of that under the head  BY GREAT SICKNESSES  has been cut out because the circumstances  mentioned and the terms used are not exactly correspondent to the ideas of delicacy which happily is in this age one of its characteristics  In the opening of the manuscript there appears to be two leaves wanting whether what is lost contained events or reflections it is impossible to judgethe leaves are not torn but cut out carefully with a knife close to the margin The beginning of the third leaf is the end of a reflection of which  itt  is the first word For further information the reader shall be now left to Sir William himself and it is hoped he will not rank the half hour spent in his society amongst the most unprofitable half hours of his life  RECOLLECTIONS  BY GENERAL SIR WILLIAM WALLER  itt but a stormy sea If I cast my eyes backward the billowes are still heaving and the angry waves are tossing their heads if I looke forward the prospect doth presente to my imagination nothing new itt is still a stormy sea and the billowes and the waves and the breakers surround the poore mariner who if by chance he doth escape comes wounded and torne and allmost spent to shore But  "  Many O Lord are thy wonderfull workes which thou hast don and thy thoughts which are to me ward they cannot be reckoned upp in order  nto thee  "  Ps xl  "  Come therefore and heare all yee that feare God and I will declare what he hath don for my Soul  "  Ps lxvi  IN PERSONALL DELIVERANCES  I may say with the Apostle glorying as he did of the things which concern mine infirmityes I have been  IN PRISONS FREQUENT  Seissed upon by the army as I was going to discharge my duty in the House of Commons and contrary to priviledg of Parliament made a prisoner in the Queen's court from thence carried ignominiously to a place under the Exchequer called Hell and the next day to the King's Head in the Strand after singled out as a sheep to the slaughter and removed to St James's thence sent to Windsor Castle and remanded to St James's againe lastly tossed like a ball into a strange country to Denbigh Castle in North Wales remote from my relations and interestsAfter above three yeares imprisonment and thus being changed as itt were from vessel to vessel itt pleased the Lord to turne my captivity and to restore me to the comforts of my poore family againe and here let me call to mind how much reason I had to be thankfull to him who chasteneth those whom he loveth for the great consolation experienced in the dear partner of my captivity She came to me disguised in mean apparell  when I had groaned in my bonds seven months thinking itt the duty of a wife to riske all things for the satisfaction of her husband Much difficulty had she in comming and was frequent on the brink of being discovered but att length over mountains and unknown roads sometimes with a guide and sometimes with none she arrived att my prison and she seemed when she discovered herself to me to be like the Angell who appeared unto Peter in like circumstances she did not indeed bid my prison gates fly open but by her sweet converse and behaviour she made those things seem light which were before heavy and scarce to be borne▪I must ever acknowledg itt also a very great mercy that being so long subject to so great a  malice  armed with so great a  power  I was not given as a prey to their teeth and that after all the indeavours that were used to finde out matter of charge against me I came off with an entire innocency not only uncondemned but unaccused  The th of August I was seized a prisoner by a party of horse in Kent and the d following I was committed to the Tower only upon jealousy and because I refused to inform the councell further than in what singly concerned my self and because I denyed to give any ingagement The  st of October following the Lord delivered me by my habeas corpus in an open cleare way notwithstanding all opposition Blessed be his holy name who hath been my constant keeper and hath not only delivered me out of the mouth of the lion as he did Paul but preserved me in itt And my trust is the Lord shall deliver me from every evill worke and will preserve me unto his heavenly Kingdome to whom be glory for ever and ever Amen  IN DEATHS OFT  By suddain accidents  In my infancy when I lay in my cradle I escaped a great danger upon the casuall discharge of a peece the shott whereof missed me very narrowly  At Winchester Castle I ran a great hassard of being buried under the ruines of an ould outwall which I had been viewing and considering how to have it taken down and I was no sooner stept into the house not above an easy stone's cast off but itt fell and covered all the place where I had been and diverse yards beyond itt My deare wife the Lady Ann had a deliverance of the very same kinde there likewise having been to look att an ould staircase which was repairing she was no sooner gon but the place where she stood fell and  in humane reason she could not but have perished in the ruines  Att Cropredy in Oxfordshire I escaped a great danger of the like nature when being with my officers att a councell of warr the floore of the roome where I was sunke under me and I lay overwhelmed with a great deal of lumber that fell upon me and yet blessed be God I had no hurt att all And att this place I did likewise escape a snare After the battell a message was sent to me by the King when I had given my answer  that I could not treat with his Majesty but by command of Parliament  I turned shortly round when the trumpet said he had a  private  mesage for me and praied me to hear him I replyed there need be no privacy not caring to give an handle to mine Enemies but some that were neare me did persuade me to heare the man and went out He then presently pulled forth a letter which to my great shame and surprise came from the Lady ****** in itt she besought me to betray my cause and this she did so wittily and kinde that I had much ado to be angry Before this lady's marriage I had been her suitor and did dearly love her and she remembered me of this and of some soft passages Whether or not she was putt on this by some greater than herself I never knew but I returned for answer that as I had  never been traitor to my love so would I not to my cause which I should be if I did as she would advise and after this I heard no more  BY GREAT SICKNESSES  I had a great deliverance from the plague att my house in Aldersgatestreet a chambermaid of my wifes being struck with itt who died within a day or two after att the pesthouse whither she was removed my wife being then great with child of my son Thomas had her by the hand in her sickness and was neare her when she was in sweats yet neither she nor any of my family were infected  Att Calais I escaped the plague when Sir Philip Stapleton died of itt and I was with him and had him by the hand not above five or six howers before he departed  BY HASSARDS IN WARR  In the warrs between the Venetians and the Archduke Ferdinand afterwards Emperour att the leaguer before Rubia I escaped severall very neere shott one grazing att my foot another lighting between Sir John Vere and me as we sate close together by the battery and yet touched neither  of us besides diverse others both great and small shott that indangered me  In the warr between the Emperour Ferdinand and the King of Bohemia I escaped miraculously out of the hands of the Cossacks when in a skirmish my horse was killed under me and in the clearing of myself from him I fell with my foot hanging in the stirrup I was incompassed by them and in making my way through them to my own men had severall shott made att me att a close distance yet itt pleased the Lord none wounded only one grazed lightly on the topp of my head and I came off with safety  Att the battell of Edghill I had my horse shott under me but I was preserved from any hurt  Att the taking of Farnham Castle I escaped a very neare shott from one of mine own men as he followed me in a narrow passage after I was entred  In my retreat from Chepstow when Prince Maurice had lined all the passages between that and Gloucester with a very considerable army to intercept me I had no way left but to transport my foote and traine of Artillery cross the Severn to Barkley Castle from whence they were secured and with  my horse and dragoones to beat thro' his quarters upon the march that night thorough the Forrest of Dean itt happened thorough the sleepiness of an officer that the maine body was separated a great distance from the fore troop with which I marched so that I was faine to make an halt for above halfe an hower within litle more than a mile of the princes head quarter in broad day light the alarme taken and not one hundred and twenty horse with me Nevertheless itt pleased God in his infinit mercy to direct the rest of my troopes to me and under the conduct of his providence I made a safe and an honorable retreat to Gloucester in despight of the enemy who charged me in the reare but with more loss to him than to me  Att Landsdown when I made the retreat I escaped a shower of shott  At the Devises when I beat the Lord Marquess Harford Prince Maurice and the Lord Hopton with their remaining forces into the town the second night after I sat down before itt having been out to visit the gardes and returning to a farmhouse at the foot of Roundway Down where I had given order to my cooke that my supper should be ready against I came in and finding my meat but newly laid to the fire in a suddain impatience I resolved  not to supp att all and so tooke horse again and rode upp to the topp where the body of my horse lay I was not gon above a muskett shott but some of the ennemy knowing the pasages thereabout which I did not and rationally supposing I might quarter in that place in regard of the convenient situation of itt between my horse and my foot came into the house and enquired and made a search for me and if I had staied there as at first I intended in all probability they might have suddainly dispatched me and retired in the darkness of night with safety enough  Some dayes after whilst I lay before the town I rode with a small party about the quarters particularly to see how the dragoones were laid on the further side of the town and being to returne back itt pleased God to putt itt suddainly into my minde to go by another way than that I came which some of the party and some of mine own servants who staid a little behind not observing but taking the former way they were almost all taken by the ennemy I came back safely  Att Farnham God appeared wonderfully for me when the Lord Hopton drew upp his whole army within culverin shott of me being with the forces of Sir Jacob Ashly who was then joined to him  att the least eight thousand horse and foot and thorough the mistake or neglect of my adiutantgenerall and the slackness of my men in drawing to the rendevous I was not able to face him with two thousand men In that extremity the Lord tooke opportunity to shew himself for me and sent so thick a mist all the morning that by reason of the darkness the ennemy durst not give on and when the mist brake upp I had such an advantage of the ground that my weakness remained undiscovered and he drew off from me I was that day delivred from an imminent destruction  Att Cheriton Field I was in danger to have been taken or killed the ennemy having by a charge given upon some troopes of mine shutt me off from mine own men I having then but three with me but itt pleased God they were repulsed againe and thereby a way opened for my retreat  I may reckon itt a mercy that upon a suddain occasion that day charging without my headpeece and being known by the ennemy as I afterwards understood I came off safe and unhurt  When the King came suddainly upon me with his whole army att Andover and I had then nothing  but a body of horse and dragoones with me I made a fair retreat to Basingstoke  Att the second Newbery fight when I fell on with my troopes by the way off Speenfield and wee were mingled with the ennemy I had a great deliverence for one of the adverse party coming behinde me and being ready to fire his pistoll in my reines in that instant one of my life guard killed him or otherwise in all probability he had killed me  "  O God the Lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head in the day off battell  "  Ps cxl  "  The Angell of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him and delivereth them  "  Ps xxxiv  IN JOURNYINGS OFT  In my travell between Venice and Florence I escaped the danger of the Inquisition att Bolonia where through the information of a priest that came along in company with me from Venice I was searched my trunke wherein I had nothing but clothes was rifled to the bottome but itt pleased God to so order itt that they lett alone a box wherein I had some papers which might have exposed  me to question when they had itt in their hands ready to open itt  In my journey into Yorkeshire to my Sisters house at Hickleton being accompanied with my wife the Lady Ann and my dear mother I reckon itt a great deliverance that when my coach mares upon the descent of an hill had broken their raines and overthrown the coachman from the box and begun to run away the raines falling down upon the ground one of the mares treading upon them they checked her bitt and made her stopp which made the rest stand likewise  IN PERILLS IN THE CITTY  When the army first marcht up to the citty of London and made that breach upon the Parliament I was voted to command a body of horse and dragoones in the nature of a flying army for the defence of the King Kingdome Parliament and Citty and whilst I was acting with others according to my duty at the Committee of Militia to advance that levy wee were all unexpectedly deserted and betraied by the citty and left out of all capitulation so that upon the entring of the army we were  inforced to lye hidd and within a few dayes after to make use of the passes which the House of Commons had given us and to quit the kingdome The Lord all that time preserved me from falling into the hands of the army though I was pursued by land and sea  When after the death of my late deare wife I had sent out my sons to schoole and removed my daughters with some part of my goods to the Lady Blanyes house in Long Acre myself remaining in that desolate condition a prisoner att St James's there was a base information given to the Councell of State by a servant of mine whome for a falsness I had putt away that I had deposited plate and jewells to a great vallue in that good Ladyes custody whereupon without any cause alledged or any thing att all in charge against me they sent a warrant signed Bradshaw by a sargeant att armes to seize upon all thatt I had there as belonging to an ennemy of the State But itt pleased the wisdome of God to befoole their malice that they made no search in mine own house where all that I had of vallue was but only in that place where there was nothing but so inconsiderable a parcell of plate that they were ashamed  to keep itt when they had itt and so they sent itt back again In the mean time I had leasure to dispose of what I had by me to a place of safety  March d I was seized upon as a prisoner by a warrant from the Protector and brought to Whitehall where I was examined by him He did examin me as a stranger not as one whome he had aforetime known and obeyed yet was he not discourteous and itt pleased the Lord to preserve me that not one thing objected could be prooved against me so I was delivered and returned with comfort to my family againe blessed be the Name of the Lord  IN PERILS AMONG FALSE BRETHREN  It pleased the House of Commons to command my service in taking care for the drawing upp for the Ordinance in favour of the Apprentices upon which account some Apprentices who negotiated that business for the rest made their application to me shortly after when that petition from the citty was to be presented which was followed with so much confusion that it gave occasion or pretence to the speaker and diverse others of the House to withdraw  to the army myself and the rest of the eleven members having then gained the leave of the House to absent ourselves for six months by that denial of our own right and priviledg to preserve if possible the priviledg of Parliament from any further violation by the army some two dayes before the presentation of the above said petition there came two persons to my house in Drury Lane to speak with me who when I came out unto them tould me they were apprentices of the Citty and came to be advised by me how they should manage their petition to whom I replyd that I knew no advice to be given but that they should be carefull to attend the House as early as they could before they were praeingaged in other business but this did not serve their purpose who came only to ensnare me whereupon they moved further and said that myself and the other impeached gentlemen were concerned in their petition and that they must and would have us into the House againe To which I returned no more but that I should have no more to do in that business and so I left them This was all that passed and yet those false impudent creatures made their report att the army that I abetted that disorder and assault upon the House and cooperated with the apprentices in itt which served to exasperate the army so much the more against me But it pleased  the Lord that they never had power to act any thing upon itt to my prejudice  After I was made a prisoner by the army and removed from the King's Head in the Strand to St James I had a message sent me from one Colonell FitzJames with the signification of his respect to me and compassion of me representing the extreme danger in which I was and the enevitable destruction that attended me if I did not endeavour to prevent itt by some escape in order to that he made me a tender of his assistance ingaging himself that he would sett me safe aboard a shipp that lay ready in the river for me to transport me beyond the reach of all mine ennemies But itt pleased God to prevent the effect of his treachery both by giving me the confidence to stand upon mine own innocency and by discovering to me that that perfidious man in the middest of all his protestations of friendshipp to me had privately offered himself to give evidence against me att the barr of the House of Commons so that it was a meere train laid to bring a guiltiness upon me and to take away my life  The like offer was made to my wife in reference to the procurement of my escape out of Windsor Castle by one Captain Kempe of Collonell Prides  regiment with the addition of an intended cheat but I was delivered as a bird out of the snare of these fowlers so that I was not catcht with their chaff  About the same time shortly after my coming to Windsor Castle having opportunity to send to my deare wife whom I had left in a disconsolat condition att London great with child and within a few weeks of her delivery as I had sealed my letter and was ready to dispatch itt away I had notice given me by my keeper that the Governour must see whatever letters I wrote or received whereupon I bad him carry itt unto him that he might open it if he thought fitt But the Governour returned itt back unto me untouched with this compliment that I was very much mistaken in him if I thought he would be so unworthy as to open letters between a man and his wife and with some further expressions of respect to me in regard he had formerly served as a Lieutenant Colonell under me This I tooke as a civility from him but I found it after to be no other than a meere insiduous practise for after an uninterrupted pasage of letters between my wife and me for about a fortnight or three weekes by which time he supposed wee might be grown to a confidence to write freely he suddainly seised upon all my letters  But there was nothing to be found in them that could prejudice me and so that snare likewise broke and I escaped the danger of it  Blessed be God  March I have reason to acknowledg itt a great mercy of God that he preserved me in so insnaring a time wherein the Lord heard my prayer  "  The wicked plotteth against the justThe Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming  "  Ps xxxvii  "  The Lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged  "  Ps xxxvii    In severall prosperous successes  THE TAKING OF SOUTHSEA CASTLE  THE TAKING OF PORTSMOUTH  It was about this time that those misunderstandings grew between me and the Lord Generall Essex  which were afterwards noticed in some sort by the Parliament and there were those who fomented our discorde for their own advancement Some whom I att that time commanded but who have since sat in a higher seat were not wanting to misrepresent and to inflame on either side and the country did suffer for these things which the Parliament well knew but thought itt not convenient att all times to notice  THE TAKING OF FARNHAM CASTLE  THE TAKING OF CHICHESTER  THE TAKING OF MALMESBURY  THE TAKING OF HEIGHNAM AND RELEIVING OF GLOUCESTER  THE TAKING OF MONMOUTH  THE TAKING OF HEREFORD  THE FIGHT AT CHERITON neere Wells in Somersetshire where Prince Maurice was wounded and I putt a stopp to his pursuit of the forces under Coll Popham whilst in these parts itt was  told that the Queen had something endeared herself when att Exeter by the following Charity Walking out northward of the citty soon after her laying in she stopped att the cottage of a poore woman whom she heard making doleful cries She sent one of her train to know what itt might be which occasioned itt the page returned and said the woman was sorrowing grievously because her daughter had been two days in the strawe and was almost dead for want of nourishment she having nothing to give her but water and not being able for the hardness of the times to gett any thing On this the Queen tooke a small chain of gould from her neck att which hung an agnus she tooke off the agnus and putt itt in her bosom and making the woman be called to her gave her the chain and bad her to go into the citty to a gouldsmith and sell itt and keepe the money to provide for the good woman in the strawe And for this her confessor did afterward rebuke her because they were hereticks when this thing was told to the King he asked jestingly if her Confessor had made the Queen do a penance for itt as she haddon once before for some innocent act when she was made to walke to Tyburn some say barefoot  THE BEATING UP OF COLL HAMILTON's QUARTERS  THE FIGHT AT LANDSDOWN  THE BEATING OF THE MARQUESS OF HARTFORDS ARMY INTO THE DEVIZES  THE ROUTING OF THE EARL OF CRAWFORDS PARTY and taking the ammuniton which he was conveying into the Devizes  THE BEATING UPP OF THE EARLE OF CRAWFORDS QUARTER ATT ALTON where five hundred of the taken to make my success the greater tooke the covenant and served under me great was my exultation but itt had bitter endings for the Parliament wrote to Essex to join me intending that we together should do a mighty worke but the Generall would not to their no small displeasure for which no good reason could be given but that he would have his great name stand alone My dismal defeat att Roundway Down was owing to those heart burnings and jealoucies for the General suffered the enemies horse to pass quietly and without molestation to the succour of their infantry which lay att the Devizes in miserable plight  The proud have laid snares for me  saith the Psalmist  and sett traps in my way  So sure was I of victory that I wrote to Parliament to bid them be att rest for that I would shortly send them an account of  the numbers taken and the numbers slaine but it pleas'd the Lord to turn my victory into mourning and my glory into shame with a small number of cavalry I retired to Bristol and there heard continually of the successes of the royal party who took heart on this mischance of mine that had never happened had others don their duty  THE TAKING OF ARUNDELL  THE BATTELL ATT CHERITON  THE TAKING OF CHRISTCHURCH  THE TAKING OF THE PASS ATT NEWBRIDG  THE TAKING OF SUDELY CASTLE  THE FIGHT ATT SPEENFIELD BY NEWBERRY  THE BEATING UPP OF COLL LONG's QUARTERS in which Cromwell's horse did good service And here I cannot but mention the wonder which I have oft times had to see this eagle in his eirey he att this time had never shown extraordinary partes nor do I think that he did himself  believe that he had them for although he was blunt he did not bear himself with pride or disdaine As an oficer he was obedient and did never dispute my orders nor argue upon them He did indeed seeme to have great cunning and whilst he was cautious of his own words not putting forth too many lest they should betray his thoughts he made others talk untill he had as it were sifted them and known their inmost designs A notable instance was his discovering in one short conversation with one Captain Giles a great favorite with the Lord Generall and whome he most confided in that although his words were full of zeal and his actions seemingly brave that his heart was not with the cause and in fine this man did shortly after join the enemy at Oxford with three and twenty stout fellowes One other instance I will here sett down being of the same sort as to his cunning  When I tooke the Lord Piercy att Andover having att that time an inconvenient distemper I desired Collonell Cromwell to entertaine him with some civility who did afterwards tell me that amongst those whom we tooke with him being about thirty their was a youth of so faire a countenance that he doubted of his condition and to confirm himself willed him to sing which he did with such a daintiness that Cromwell scrupled not  to say to Lord Piercy that being a warriour he did wisely to be accompanied by  Amazons  on which that Lord in some confusion did acknowledg that she was a damsel this afterwards gave cause for scoffe att the King's party as that they were loose and wanton and minded their pleasure more than either their Country's service or their Maister's good  THE INFALL AT THE DEVIZES and the taking of Major Rowles and his horse the remainder of Colonell Long's regiment  "  Not unto us O Lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake  "  Ps cxv  "  Thine O Lord is the victory  "  Chron xxix  IN RETURNES FOR PRAIER  When it pleased God after seven years expectation that my first wife fell into travell I could not but be very apprehensive of the weakness of her condition and having retired myself to praier and earnestly besought God to strengthen her and being desirous to comfort myself out of Gods word I tooke the bible to read and letting itt fall with  some passion upon the table without any particular designe upon one place more than another itt opened upon the Psalme in the singing Psalmes  "  Like fruitfull vines on thy house side so doth thy wife spring out  "  with which being surprised I presumed to make a triall whether itt were more than an accident or no the good Lord forgive me for that presumption and taking upp another bible that lay by itt opened likewise upon the same place within a few howers after my wife was safely delivered  Not long after this being at London I was suddainly taken with a fitt of the stone in that violence that itt grew insupportable to me whereupon I cast myself upon my knees and besought God for his mercy to me and before I rose upp my paine was mitigated and within one quarter of an hower I was perfectly well  After the death of my first wife and of my son which I had by her both very deare blessings to me when I putt on a resolution to marry againe I humbly besought God to provide such a wife for me as might be an help to me in the way of his service and that I might have a religious woman or none and when his providence directed me to Lady Ann Finch and that all things were agreed upon between my Lord her father and me in reference  to the marriage upon her motion she and I agreed together to sett a day apart to seeke God for his blessing in itt Itt pleased the Lord to answer our praiers in as full a measure of comfort as ever was powred out opon a married couple and though att the first there were some litle differences in our natures and judgments as to some particulars yet within a litle while that good God wrought us to that uniformity that I may say wee were but as one soul in two bodyes  After I had quitted the service of the Parliament in the field and was returned to London and there settled with my family my estate began to fall short part thereof lying in the Kings Quarters and the rest through the distraction of the times affording me very litle subsistence To supply my necessityes I was faine to sell severall things and in the end I was at such a pinch as that without selling my plate which I had kept as my last reserve of vallue I knew not how to send to markett whereupon my wife and I having recommended our condition to God resolved the next morning to send our plate to the gouldsmiths and to make money of itt But the next morning I was wakened by my servant who lett me know there was one come from Barnstaple with some mony for me The sum was not above fifteen  pounds but that served my present occasions and before that was spent I received a further releife so as I was put to no more such exigencyes  Blessed be God  When his Majesty was at Worcester I thought itt my duty to seeke God for him in that distressed condition itt pleased the Lord to inlarge my heart with much comfort and to give me a confident assurance that I should have an answer of peace The issue was that his royall person was miraculously delivered out of the hands of those hunters  After my returne from D when I tooke upp a resolution to marry againe I besought God for his direction in my choice who heard my petition and sent me the Lady Harcourt to repaire the breach formerly made in my poore family which was so rich a blessing that I can never sufficiently acknowledg itt That God hearing praier who hath with the generall approbation of good men united us by his sacred ordinance and made us not only one flesh but one spirit one in our affections judgments wayes ends as if wee had been both cutt out of one peece he vouchsafes to preserve us together for the advancement of his service and glory  "  Because thou hast been my help therefore in the shaddow of thy wings will I rejoyce my soul followeth hard after thee  "  Ps lxiii  "  Because he has inclined his care unto me therefore will I call upon him as long as I live  "  Ps cxvi  IN FATHERLIKE CHASTICEMENTS  My endeavour to supplant Mr Yard in his possession of the markett of Newton Abbot though upon a dormant title yet proceeding from a covetous end was justly punished both in the loss of the thing I sued for and in all that trouble befell me in Kings Bench  When out of a covetuous desire to gaine a good bargaine upon Mr Price his lease by Winchester I laid down five hundred pounds as a claw upon itt by way of morgage God justly punished me both in the loss of the lease and of my mony too  It was just with God for the punishment of my giving way to the plunder of the Citty of Winchester to permitt the demolition of my house att Winchester  My vanity in furniture justly punished in the loss of a great part of itt by the treachery of Ellis  My presumption upon mine own strength and former successes justly humbled at the Devises  This was the most heavy stroke of any that did ever befall me General Essex had thought to persuade the Parliament to compromise with the King which so inflamed the zealous that they moved that the command of their army might be bestow'd upon me but the news of this defeat arrived whilst they were deliberating on my advancement and itt was to me a double defeat I had nearly sunke under the affliction but that I had a deare and sweet Comforter and I did att that time prove according to Ecclesiasticus chap xxvi  "A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husbandAs the Sun when itt ariseth in the high Heaven so is the beauty of a good wife"  verse  by an utter defeat and att Croperdy with a dishonorable blow  Itt was just with God to lay me by all employment as a broken vessel in regard of the corruption of my heart in my first ingagement and neglect of reformation in the officers and souldiery under me  My not attending unto nor improoving by sermons when itt pleased the Lord to come under my roofe and to visit me by his ministers att St James's was justly punished att Denbigh by a restraint from all ordinances  After the end of the warr that I began to enjoy my estate and the comforts of my family againe and upon passing of the vote in the House of Commons of  l  to be settled upon me as a compensation for my service I was puffed upp with a presumption that I should never be moved whereupon God most justly within a few months after sent those severall chastisements upon me banishment imprisonment sickness the death of my wife poverty  The not paying my vow upon the marriage with my wife justly punished by Gods taking her from me  "  It is good for me that I have been afflicted that I might learn thy statutes  "  Ps cxix  "  Rejoice not against me O mine ennemy when I fall I shall arise when I sitt in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me I will beare the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against him untill he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and I shall behold his righteosness  "  Micah vii  In acknowledgment of Gods infinit mercy and goodness declared in his many deliverances of me  and in his comforts and blessings to me particularly in my inlargement from my long captivity my returne with comfort to my children and family and that inestimable blessing he hath been pleased to bestow upon me in a most deare good wife I vow by his grace assisting and enabling me to restraine them in a thankfull memory and to transmitt the recordation of them to my children that they may never be forgotten neither by me nor my posterity  I humbly renew my vowes both againste the practice or purpose of every gross sin or the allowance of any though never so small and resolve so farr as I am able to shun the occasions of them and in particular I protest by the help of the divine grace against giving any entertainment or lodging in my heart to A P S C H W L  As a poore thank offring for so many undeserved mercyes I humble renue the consecration of the tenth of whatsoever I receive in my estate to pious uses and besides the th formerly devoted to those ends in acknowledgment of my deliverance out of prison I vow one hundred pounds more as an oblation to God for the blessing and happiness I enjoy in my present married condition to be employed in such wayes as I shall be directed by my godly friends And if I be repaid the debt owing me  from my L K I engage myself to dispose forty pounds of itt with the addition of tenn pounds more unto itt to the town of Newton Abbot in Devon for the making upp of their stock for the setting of the poor at worke in the workhouse there erected by me I humbly devote my life to God who hath so often preserved itt and so many wayes blessed itt resolving by his grace to do all I can for the setting of him upp in my heart to love feare and trust him more to pray read and heare more and more zealously than I have don hitherto to walke in my particular calling more uprightly constantly chearfully fruitfully and to endeavour to become better in all relations both to the publick in church and state whensoever I shall be in a capacity to serve them and in private as a father husband maister c  As a father indeavouring to bring upp my children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord teaching them his feare both by precept and example with a spirit of meekness that they may not be discouraged  As an husband dwelling with my dear yokefellow according to knowledg loving her as mine own body as mine ownself as Christ loved his Church so taking care with her for the things of this world  that as wee study to please one another we may likewise remember the homage wee both owe to God and labour above all things to please him  As a maister so carrying my self towards my servants forbearing threatning giving them what is just and equall as knowing that I also have a maister in Heaven and making provision for my family according to my duty  I will pay thee my vowes which my lipps have uttered  "  and my mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble  "  Ps lxxvi  "  I will pay that that I have vowed Salvation is of the Lord  "  Jonah ii  A DAILY DIRECTION  EVERY day is a litle life in the account whereof wee may reckon our birth from the wombe of the morning our growing time from thence to noone when we are as the Sun in his strength after which like a  Ps cii  shaddow that declineth wee hasten to the evening of our age till att last wee close our eyes in sleep the image of death and our whole life is but this tale of a day tould over and over I should therefore so spend every day as if itt were all the life I had to live and in pursuance of this end and of the vow I have made to walke with God in a closer communion than I have formerly don I would indeavour by his grace to observe in the course of my remaining spann or rather inche of life this daily directory  Ps cxxxix Ps lxiii  To awake with God as early as I can and to consecrate the first fruits of my thoughts unto him  by praier and meditaion and by renued acts of faith and repentance that so God may awake for me and make the habitation of my righteosness prosperous  Job vili  To this end I would make itt my care to lye down the night before in the peace of God who hath promised that his commandement shall keep me when I sleep and talke with me when I awake otherwise itt may be justly feared that those corruptions that bid me  last  good night will be ready to give me  first  good morrow    After this follows sixteen pages of text from scripture and scriptural allusions under the head of  DAILY DANGERS  of which the publisher thought the preceding pages had sufficient and on his judgment the rest are suppressed But the writer's concluding reflections on his own situation and on that of the Protector's shall be preserved He speaks of some enmities he had encountered and continues    When that poore man who relied on his maister's word understood that the King had consented to his death he piteously cried out putt not your trust in princes and nearly as good cause have I to say putt not your trust in Parliaments I have served  Parliament with my blood and with my estate and gained nothing the while but mistrusts prisons and neglect att one time so full of my services they were going to make me General of all their forces but a panic of my horse which deserted me turned the tide of their good will and Essex was taken againe into favour and then againe as a preliminary of peace they would have me made a Baron and two thousand five hundred pounds a yeare settled therewith but on a suddain tooke me into custody and committed me to the Tower  Now after all these traverses and manifold injuries both in person and estate itt hath pleased the Almighty that I am sat down on the remnants of my fortune which are yet sufficient for my comfort sounde in body and minde and I can see there be those who stand as Job did even amongst Princes that may and that not far off be glad to be no worse The humoure of the times doth already begin to change and the declaration putt forth by Major J Wildman for which he was confined in Chepstow Castle speaks the temper of most men▪ O C was derided lately in going to Hampton Court by one who cried out no Protector no Roundhead which he thought fitt to pass unnoted and not long before a woman said as he was going into his coach att Whitehall that bonny heads were cutt  off whilst ugly ones did keepe upon their shoulders These things are but small but as the distant speck att sea betokeneth a storme so do these speak a  brewing  some where that may burst out and overwhelme the helmsman  "  Pride goeth before destruction and a
