POETICAL CALENDAR  AUGUST AN ODE  THE garden blooms with vegetable gold  And all Pomona in the orchard glows  Her racy fruits now glory in the sun  The wallenamour'd flower in saffron blows  Gay annuals their spicy sweets unfold  To cooling brooks the panting cattle run  Hope the forerunner of the farmer's gain  Visits his dreams and multiplies the grain  More hot it grows ye fervors of the sky  Attend the Virginlo she comes to hail  Your sultry radianceNow the God of day  Meets her chaste starbe present Zephyr's gale  To fan her bosomlet the breezes fly  On silver pinions to salute his ray  Bride of his soft desires with comely grace  He clasps the virgin to his warm embrace  The reapers now their shining sickles bear  A band illustrious and the sons of Health  They bend they toil across the wide champaign  Before them Ceres yields her flowing wealth  The partridgecovey to the copse repair  For shelter sated with the golden grain  Bask on the bank or thro' the clover run  Yet safe from setters and the slaughtering gun  Courtly Augustus whom the bards rever'd  Patron of science and the genial arts  Nam'd this fair Month which permanent shall live  Long as his bright idea in our hearts  And lasting as the monument he rear'd  Like him ye princes would ye long survive  Thro' time's successive aeras thus bestow  Like him those bounties whence your honours flow  Myra and I together in the shade  Where yonder jasmine forms a proud alcove  Will taste the cooling sherbet or regale  On juicy melonsWill my rosy love  Or there retireor walk this green parade  And talk of nuptials in the chesnut vale  Nuptials our hearts which shall for ever bind  While the swain's constant and the damsel kind  ELEGY ON DELIA'S BEING IN THE COUNTRY WHERE HE SUPPOSES SHE STAYS TO SEE THE HARVEST  BY THE LATE MR HAMMOND  NOW Delia breathes in woods the fragrant air  Dull are the hearts that still in town remain  Venus herself attends on Delia there  And Cupid sports amid the sylvan train  Oh with what joy my Delia to behold  I'd press the spade or wield the weighty prong  Guide the slow ploughshare thro' the stubborn mold  And patient goad the loitering ox along  The scorching heats I'll carelessly despise  Nor heed the blisters on my tender hand  The great Apollo wore the same disguise  Like me subdued to Love's supreme command  No healing herbs could sooth their matter's pain  The art of physic lost and useless lay  To Peneus' stream and Tempe's shady plain  He drove his herds beneath the noontide ray  Oft with a bleating lamb in either arm  His blushing  The goddess Diana  sister saw him pace along  Oft would his voice the silent valley charm  'Till lowing oxen broke the tender song  Where are his triumphs where his warlike toil  Where by his darts the crested Python slain  Where are his Delphi his delightful isle  The God himself is grown a cottage swain  O Ceres in your golden fields no more  With harvest's cheerful pomp my fair detain  Think what for lost  The daughter of Ceres taken fr  m her by Pluto  Proserpina you bore  And in a mother's anguish feel my pain  Our wiser fathers left the fields unsown  Their food was acorns Love their sole employ  They met they lik'd they stay'd but till alone  And in each valley snatch'd the honest joy  No wakeful guard no doors to stop desire  Thrice happy timesbut oh I fondly rave  Lead me to Deliaall her eyes inspire  I'll doI'll plough or dig as Delia's slave  THE MULBERRY GARDEN  WHen in full pride autumnal fields appear  And ripen'd plenty loads the smiling year  With grassy honours cloaths the verdant plain  And golden harvests wave their bending grain  Lead me where trees in lengthening ranks display'd  Please with their fruit and solace with their shade  Where dewy mulberries their refreshment lend  And thro' the grove with burthen'd boughs extend  The spreading leaves with salutary food  Sustain the tender silkworm's toiling brood  Whose labour'd webs the shady verdure crown  And dress their surface with a shining down  Such on Acanthus' woolly leaves are bred  And where their silken groves the Seres spread  Lo on the trees that bend with clustering weight  The juicy berries swell in purple state  Not apples that Alcinous' gardens bear  The melting plumb nor fam'd Crustumian pear  Nor fruits of golden or transparent rind  In relish equal this delicious kind  The careful dames a plenteous wine produce  And brew with mingling spice the pleasing juice  The Rhetic grape not purer nectar yields  Nor the proud growth of rich Falernian fields  Let the cool draught my thirsty veins supply  When sultry Sirius taints the fervid sky  Thy gifts O Bacchus more intemperate prove  And to rash heats th' unruly passions move  By wine enflam'd young Ammon basely spilt  His friend's warm gore an unexampled guilt  Provok'd by wine the Centaurs heated train  Presum'd with blood the bridal board to stain  Wine arm'd with rage the mad Ciconian crew  Whose hands profane the sacred Thracian flew  Anacreon's fate its mischiefs shall enroll  And direful Circe's fascinating bowl  With softer draughts this temperate liquor ply  Nor fear a threatening from its sanguine die  A borrow'd tincture for with native white  The pendant berries first allur'd the sight  'Till hapless Pyramus by love betray'd  Found the torn mantle of th' expected maid  Mistaken omen and with fatal haste  On the drawn steel his blooming body cast  The snowy fruit that there untainted grew  Wash'd with his gore forsook their silver hue  Their swelling pores receive a deepening stain  And still the lover's memory they retain  For as the circling year with fruit returns  The pitying tree in graceful sable mourns  Ye fair who oft beneath its verdure plac'd  In sultry hours this cooling berry taste  When with warm lips you press the purple dew  And on your snowy hands the print you view  To let your generous pity more appear  Dilute the harmless crimson with a tear  THE MONTH OF AUGUST  This poem was wrote by mrs Leapor See her character in the Poet Cal for July p  A PASTORAL  SYLVANUS A COURTIER PHILLIS A COUNTRY MAID  SYLVANUS  HAil Phillis brighter than a morning sky  Joy of my heart and darling of my eye  See the kind year her grateful tribute yields  And roundfac'd Plenty triumphs o'er the fields  But to yon gardens let me lead thy charms  Where the curl'd vine extends her willing arms  Whose purple clusters lure the longing eye  And the ripe cherries show their scarlet dye  PHILLIS  Not all the sights your boasted gardens yield  Are half so lovely as my father's field  Where large increase has blest the fruitful plain  And we with joy behold the swelling grain  Whose ears luxuriant to the earth reclin'd  Wave nod and tremble to the whisking wind  SYLVANUS  But see to emulate those cheeks of thine  On yon fair tree the blushing nectarines shine  Beneath their leaves the ruddy peaches glow  And the plump figs compose a gallant show  With gaudy plums see yonder boughs recline  And ruddy pears in yon espalier twine  There humble dwarfs in pleasing order stand  Whose golden product seems to court thy hand  PHILLIS  In vain you tempt me while our orchard bears  Longkeeping russets lovely catherine pears  Permains and codlins wheaten plums enow  And the black damsons load the bending bough  No pruningknives our fertile branches teaze  While your's must grow but as their masters please  The grateful trees our mercy well repay  And rain us bushels at the rising day  SYLVANUS  Fair are my gardens yet you slight them all  Then let us haste to yon majestic hall  Where the glad roofs shall to thy voice resound  Thy voice more sweet than music's melting sound  Orion's beam infests the sultry sky  And scorching fevers thro' the welkin fly  But art shall teach us to evade his ray  And the forc'd fountains near the windows play  There choice perfumes shall give a pleasing gale  And orangeflowers their odorous breath exhale  While on the walls the wellwrought paintings glow  And dazzling carpets deck the floors below  O tell me thou whose careless beauties charm  Are not these fairer than a thresher's barn  PHILLIS  Believe me I can find no charms at all  In your fine carpets and your painted hall  'Tis true our parlour has an earthen floor  The sides of plaster and of elm the door  Yet the rubb'd chest and table sweetly shines  And the spread mint along the window climbs  An aged laurel keeps away the sun  And two cool streams across the garden run  SYLVANUS  Can feasts or music win my lovely maid  In both those pleasures be her taste obey'd  The ransack'd earth shall all its dainties send  'Till with its load her plenteous table bend  Then to the roofs the swelling notes shall rise  Pierce the glad air and gain upon the skies  While ease and rapture spreads itself around  And distant hills roll back the charming sound  PHILLIS  Not this will lure me for I'd have you know  This night to feast with Corydon I go  To night his reapers bring the gather'd grain  Home to his barns and leave the naked plain  Then beef and coleworts beans and bacon too  And the plumpudding of delicious hue  Sweetspiced cake and applepies good store  Deck the brown board and who can wish for more  His flute and tabor too Amyntor brings  And while he plays soft Amaryllis sings  Then strive no more to win a simple maid  From her lov'd cottage and her silent shade  Let Phillis ne'er ah never let her rove  From her first virtue and her humble grove  Go seek some nymph that equals your degree  And leave content and Corydon for me  VIRTUE AND FAME TO THE COUNTESS OF EGREMONT  BY LORD LN  VIrtue and Fame the other day  Happen'd to cross each other's way  Said Virtue "Hark ye madam Fame  " Your ladyship is much to blame  " Jove bids you always wait on me  " And yet your face I seldom see  " The Paphian queen employs your trumpet  " And bids it praise some handsome strumpet  " Or thundering thro' the ranks of war  " Ambition ties you to her car"  Saith Fame "Dear madam I protest  " I never think myself so blest  " As when I humbly wait behind you  " But 'tis so mighty hard to find you  " In such obscure retreats you lurk  " To seek you is an endless work"  " Well answer'd Virtue I allow  " Your plea But hear and mark me now  " I know without offence to others  " I know the best of wives and mothers  " Who never pass'd an useless day  " In scandal gossiping or play  " Whose modest wit chastis'd by sense  " Is lively cheerful innocence  " Whose heart nor envy knows nor spite  " Whose duty is her sole delight  " Nor rul'd by whim nor slave to fashion  " Her parent's joy her husband's passion"  Fame smil'd and answer'd "On my life  " This is some country parson's wife  " Who never saw the court nor town  " Whose face is homely as her gown  " Who banquets upon eggs and bacon"  " No madam noyou're much mistaken  " I beg you'll let me set you right  " 'Tis one with every beauty bright  " Adorn'd

TO THE EARL OF HKE OCCASIONED BY THE FOREGOING VERSES  MY LORD  "A Thousand thanks to your lordship for your addition to my verses If you can write such extempore it is well for other poets that you chuse to be a Lord Chancellor rather than a Laureat They explain to me a vision I had the night before"  MEthought I saw before my feet  With countenance serene and sweet  The muse who in my youthful days  Had oft inspir'd my careless lays  She smil'd and said "Once more I see  " My fugitive returns to me  " Long had I lost you from my bower  " You scorn'd to own my gentle power  " With me no more your genius sported  " The grave Historic Muse you courted  " Or rais'd from earth with straining eyes  " Pursued Urania thro' the skies  " But now to my forsaken track  " Fair Egremont has brought you back  " Nor blush by her and virtue led  " That soft that pleasing path to tread  " For there beneath tomorrow's ray  " Even Wisdom's self shall deign to play  " Lo to my flowery groves and springs  " Her favourite son the goddess brings  " The council's and the senate's guide  " Law's oracle the nation's pride  " He comes he joys with thee to join  " In singing Wyndham's charms divine

impart  Tribute of a feeling heart  Take the muse's latest spark  Ere we drop into the dark  He who parts and virtue gave  Bad thee look beyond the grave  Genius soars and virtue guides  Where the love of God presides  There's a gulph 'twixt us and God  Let the gloomy path be trod  Why stand shivering on the shore  Why not boldly venture o'er  Where unerring Virtue guides  Let us brave the winds and tides  Safe thro' seas of doubts and fears  Rides the bark which Virtue steers  THE MUSES MERCURY AND FAME ON OCCASION OF SIR WILLIAM IRBY'S BEING CREATED LORD BOSTON  THE Muses were on Pindus met  When Hermes brought a coronet  And saidhis brow let this entwine  In whom the fairest virtues shine  He whose benevolence of soul  No selfish impulse can controul  In whom politeness is combin'd  With sylvan probity of mind  Who candid generous and just  We safely to his word may trust  Who view'd in each domestic light  Husband or father glads the sight  Whose offspring form his darling care  And thence each wish'd perfection share  Whose firm fidelity long tried  Like gold will every test abide  Whose ceaseless services must claim  'Mongst courtiers some distinguish'd name  Who to his sovereign's interest true  Has Britain's weal in stedfast view  When Fame who listen'd all the while  Stept in and spake thus with a smile  MusesIf you would justice show  Let me the radiant gift bestow  Her airy pinions then she spread  And plac'd it on lov'd Irby's head  WROTE BY A LADY ON A GLASS UNDER HER NAME  FRail glass thou bear'st my name as well as I  And who can tell in which it first shall die  ODE TO SOLITUDE  HAil pensive virgin ever hail  Oft have I met thee in the vale  And oft inscrib'd a song to thee  When musing near yon aged tree  Nor serious silent Solitude  Didst thou despise my numbers rude  Remote from man in shady dell  Thou hears the loud funereal bell  Or from the thronged city far  At evening counts each little star  Or by the pale moon's silver light  O'er hill and forest takes thy flight  Sweet nun who haunts the lonely lane  Teach me that life is short and vain  That grandeur pageantry and power  Will vanish all at death's dread hour  That beauty's roses soon decay  Like odoriferous flowers in May  Teach me to weep for others woe  O cause the tender tear to flow  Fair woodland nymph when all is still  Thou climbs the high adjacent hill  And oft by Thames's rushy side  Delights to hear the smooth wave glide  Sister of peace and piety  Sweet nun I long to visit thee  FOUR ELEGIES  BY MR STEPHEN PANTING  ELEGY I MORNING  Sweet is the breath of Morn her rising sweet  With charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun  When first on this delightful land he spreads  His orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower  Glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth  After soft showers and sweet the coming on  Of grateful Evening mild then smiling Night  MILTON  THE opening east now streaks a ruddy ray  The morn farstreaming shakes the realms of night  Aurora pours the bright resplendent day  And drowsy darkness wings her heavy flight  The eveborn fogs in vagrant vapours rise  And shade the earth with clouds of murky hue  'Till Phoebus chasing Chaos from the skies  Bedecks th' enlighten'd scene with radiant dew  Nature awak'd from sweet refreshing rest  Infuses vigour thro' Creation's reign  Gay pleasures dawn and gladden every breast  While Joy inspires one universal strain  In greener verdure shines each tree array'd  A brighter blossom buds the leafy spray  The swarming songsters thro' the sylvan shade  On every bush blythewarbling pour the lay  To shun the loath'd embrace of meagre want  The early threshers whirl aloft the flail  And lusty woodmen at the lark's first chant  The forestecho with their axes hail  Now whistling hinds prepare the toilful plow  Or drive o'er flowery lawns the frisking flock  Now shepherds climb the summit's craggy brow  And goats highpendent browse the bushy rock  The bigswoln udder prompts the lowing train  The balmy tribute to their lord to pay  The merry milkmaid and the jocund swain  Now carol wild a rustic roundelay  The jolly hunter winds his buglehorn  And cheerful notes rend wide the welkin round  Shrill echo wakes the slowlyrising morn  And every glowing bosom feels the sound  In civil life where various arts abound  That give or ease or dignity to man  The dawning light and busy scene around  Display the thoughtful brow and toilful clan  Now lightly tripping o'er the breezy green  The bright Hygeia leads her festive train  Now youngeyed Pleasure's laughing troop is seen  To tread in mazy dance the pearly plain  Whilst on the yielding pillow's downy folds  In sleepy state nods Sloth's destructive power  A stupid dose her drowsy votaries holds  And man beguiles of life's most precious hour  Around her couch sits spiritwasting spleen  The hollow eye that looks heartgnawing care  The asthma pallid form and sickness green  While physic's solemn sons smile dreadful near  The crew who late so barbarously gay  Swell'd the loud riot o'er the midnight bowl  In Morpheus' cave unseemly snore the day  Void of each manly nobleness of soul  The upland walks more sapient spirits seek  Where ease and health and sweet content agree  Where rosy redness streaks the blooming cheek  Where pompous doctor never palm'd a fee  As Nature's variegated beauties rise  How swells the growing landscape on the eye  From the fine blendure of ten thousand dyes  The visual soul is lost in grand variety  Now gay imagination boldly roves  Excursive thro' creation's ample scene  O'er the bare desert thro' the spicy groves  The dank wave's depth and ether's blue serene  Oft too inspir'd at morning's early dawn  The bard high wrapt in sweet poetic dream  Or slowly wanders o'er the dewy lawn  Or on the daisied marge of murmuring stream  There as Aurora shed ambrosial light  Erst to her Shakespear's lov'd embrace she flew  There swell'd his soul with rapturous delight  As Nature's genuine charms her pencil drew  Oft Spencer too Eliza's blithest swain  With her in dalliance has the hours beguil'd  From oaten reed oft pip'd the artless strain  To moral fiction Fancy's loveliest child  O power that giv'st the energy of song  Without whose aid the labour'd volume's nought  O snatch a votary from the lifeless throng  Inspire each line and animate each thought  Thy genial impulse warms the bard to sing  In every different clime and rolling age  And erst beside thy fairygrot did spring  Each Attic wreath that crowns the tuneful sage  ELEGY II NOON  HIgh in the zenith of his wide domain  Flames the bright power that rules the noontide ray  O'er the fierce steeds loose shakes the golden rein  And darts around intolerable day  Beside his chariot born with rapid speed  Enfeebling Sweats and paly Languors ride  Wan Sickness mounted on a sunbeam steed  Flashes her pestilential falchion wide  The vermeil verdure of th' enamell'd mead  The flocks the herds all feel the sultry power  Scorch'd nature fainting droops her languid head  And all creation mourns the fervent hour  By gelid founts and rills that purl the glade  Where Dian's sylvan train at noon resort  The Dryad Coolness seeks the sheltering shade  While round her mossbed balmy breezes sport  Oft now sequester'd in the lonely dale  Where nought obtruding may their joys prevent  The happy lover sighs the tender tale  While glowing blushes speak the soft consent  Around the turf ten thousand Cupids play  Or sweetly prattling lisp th' extatic bliss  Shortbreathing wishes throng and romping May  The ruffling dalliance and the kindling kiss  With purest truth here artless passion charms  No fraud nor sordid thoughts love's shrine invade  An equal flame each beating bosom warms  No airs distract the swain nor falshood mourns the maid  In flowery scenes where waves the leafy shade  Where woodbine's bloom and thymy verdure spring  In vacant mood is learned Leisure laid  And to blithe echo sweeps the vocal string  Or smit with sacred love of antient song  Where art and genius rule with mingled rage  He rolls the raptures of the tuneful throng  That drew with classic skill fair virtue's page  Now where Augusta lifts her head sublime  And wealthy Commerce holds her honour'd stand  The sons of industry from every clime  With Albion's chiefs appear a motley band  Beneath th' auspicious beamings of her smile  Britannia sees her real glories rise  Calm peace and cheerful plenty crown her isle  To hostile shores while want and terror flies  And long lov'd isle may bounteous heaven pour  These gracious blessings on thy favour'd land  And as thou stand'st the first in regal power  In virtue may'st thou too the foremost stand  Now Hospitality a matron hoar  Whose step on piteous charity attends  With liberal hand unfolds her genial store  His dreary path where pensive Penury bends  Her generous smiles sad Sorrow's tumults calm  And glad the meagre sons of needy Care  O'er wounded minds free pours the healing balm  That sooths each woesprung thought and gloomy fear  Erst was she frequent in Britannia seen  The warm inspirer of each noble breast  But rarely now she treads this earthly scene  To heaven is flown each heavendescended guest  For see wheree'er the gilded turrets rise  And modern Grandeur holds her pompous seat  From costly cates where fragrant fumes arise  There lavish Luxury leads the princely treat  The daedal arches flowery wreaths entwine  And joyous music swells the festive strain  The bowls high foam with witinspiring wine  And laughing Comus leads his jovial train  T'arrest the pleasures of the thoughtless band  See every dire disease in troops appear  A deathdart arms each spectre's meagre hand  And Want exulting swells the ghastly rear  Far other scenes the decent dome displays  Where modest Temperance holds her artless reign  There gaudy Greatness pours no idle blaze  Nor wanton Folly leads her revel train  Content is there and Innocence and Health  The breast humane that feels another's woe  Virtues that yield such happiness as Wealth  With all her pageant pomp can ne'er bestow  Hail blissful state where beams the eye serene  The manly heart and brow unknown to care  Where brighteyed Hope illumes each darkling scene  Averting every shaft of fell despair  ELEGY III EVENING  THE broad sun verging on the close of day  A fuller red beams o'er th' etherial plain  The streaky clouds attend his last bright ray  And silver Vesper leads his starry train  Dim fades each lovely variegated scene  That swell'd to extasy the visual soul  As mistclad Evening treads the breezy green  And wakes the buzzing bat and mopeing owl  O'er Vegetation's numerous tribes she pours  The dews refreshing as their sweets exhale  While from the odorous shrubs and breathing flowers  A balmy fragrance swells the pregnant gale  Now labour rests and to the sons of toil  Sweet relaxation gives the vacant hour  While ease or sports or social scenes beguile  As fancy prompts mankind's directive power  By courage fir'd to many a hardy game  To the throng'd ring the village youths repair  Where young ambition pants for generous fame  And victory's wreath oft wins the scornful fair  Or with the bright maid join'd whose mutual glance  Holds in love's silken bonds the feeling heart  On the gay green they tread the mazy dance  Whilst sweettongued Phoebe plays the minstrel's part  The sons of genius forc'd by heat extreme  Waste in the cooling shade the tedious day  Now setting Phoebus pours the milder gleam  Thro' the thrushhaunted copse or upland stray  Where to chant forth their evening hymn of praise  Full frequent perch'd on many a verdant spray  Their warblings wild the feather'd songsters raise  By far more sweet than art's most labour'd lay  Whilst blithsome milkmaids in the neighbouring mead  The rural ditty tune in cheerful strain  The weary woodman seeks his lowly shed  And thoughtless plowboy whistles o'er the plain  How sweet the pleasure at mild evening's hour  When gentle breezes fan the sultry air  To seek Reflection in her lonely bower  Or drown in generous wine intruding care  Or where meandring Isis' waters stray  And woo with many a kiss Oxonia's plain  In sharpprow'd boat to cut the liquid way  And at the bending oar with pleasure strain  And see how generous emulation fires  The youths that in the neighbouring wherry ride  While hope of victory this and that inspires  Tho' equal skill and strength retains them side by side  But now some deepstruck oar the weeds detain  The rivals shoot with rapid speed ahead  Success strings every nerve warms every vein  While gloomy grief is o'er the vanquish'd spread  Just emblem this of man's uncertain state  For when long plodding some ambitious scheme  Ready to reach the top some shaft of fate  Arrests him vainly wise and ends his pleasing dream  ELEGY IV MIDNIGHT  SOL rolls no more his beamy car on high  No more benignly pours the radiant ray  Sad sable darkness wide obscures the sky  And gloomy night usurps the realms of day  Gay Pleasure treads no more the glossy green  Lost are the beauties of the verdant plain  Creation droops thro' Nature's ample scene  And Chaos reassumes his dreary reign  Soft warbling thro' the silent ether's space  No easy notes now strike the listening ear  But owls and bats deep night's illomen'd race  Appal the timid soul with wild distracting fear  Horror too clad in terrible array  Of phantom beings leads his bugbear train  From opening graves now solemn sounds dismay  And ghosts dire yelling stalk the dreary plain  O'er sheeted lakes and heaths of misty hue  Where fancy forms the fairy's magic court  By the pale moon or vapours glimmering blue  Th' ideal elves of night their gambols sport  Now where devotion holds her high abode  And vivid tapers gloom the sacred isle  To sound the praises of th' eternal God  The loudpeal'd organ shakes the holy pile  Hail midnight hail and thou the solemn scene  The sadlyserious melancholy's cell  Where nought of Folly's savage train is seen  But where the sons of thought delight to dwell  Let artful statesmen scheme the awful hour  Let empire wake ambition's daring train  To rouse rebellion's fell destructive power  And give dire discord o'er mankind to reign  Let avarice gore the wretched miser's breast  To watch with vulture care his artrais'd mine  Let fierce desire distract the lover's rest  To sigh sad plaints at cruel Sylvia's shrine  Or where the Bacchanalians hold their reign  And riot rules with wild despotic sway  Let lavish spendthrifts swell the bestial train  And thoughtless in life's fatal follies stray  Far other bliss far other joys be mine  O thoughtbefriending Contemplation sweet  To where the midnight tapers dimly shine  Conduct benign a studious votary's feet  Give me in Learning's ample field to stray  Its sacred tomes of treasur'd sense unfold  With steady step to trace the devious way  Where sleep the latent mines of classic gold  Or 'midst the solemn stillness of the grove  Where Philomela warbles woodnotes wild  With me O Contemplation deign to rove  The sacred scene inviting musings mild  There till gay Phoebus gilds another sky  With thee I'll waste the sweetlyserious hour  From life's low scenes and fatal follies fly  And woo sage wisdom in her cavern'd bower  These sounds while fancy's plastic power exprest  As thro' the solitary wilds I stray'd  Majestic like a Roman matron drest  Imagination saw the heavenly maid  Around a sudden gleam illum'd the place  The path with easy elegance she trod  When thussoftsmiling with angelic grace  " Here Contemplation holds her still abode  " Here oft my Milton in the midnight gloom  " Has caught the lofty sentiment refin'd  " Here oft sought science in her cloister'd dome  " Hence fill'd the mighty volume of his mind  " Here learnt above the duller sons of earth  " In all the dignity of thought to rise  " Here plann'd the work that told creation's birth  " Hence gain'd his native palace in the skies  " But rais'd to join the aerial choir on high  " That chant harmonious at th' Almighty's throne  " Mov'd at the pensive world's complaintive sigh  " I to direct them sent this second son"  When leading in her hand a reverend sage  Her heavenly accents thus my ears addrest  " Receive the instructor of a darkened age  " Religion's friend and Piety's highpriest"  She ceas'd and to my fancy's longing sight  No more was given the glorious form to see  She fled along the thickening shades of night  And left the world to Darkness Young and Me  WINE A POEM  BY THE LATE MR GAY  Nulla placere diu nec vivere carmina possunt  Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus  HOR  OF happiness terrestrial and the source  Whence human pleasures flow sing heavenly muse  Of sparkling juices of the enlivening grape  Whose quickening taste adds vigour to the soul  Whose sovereign power revives decaying nature  And thaws the frozen blood of hoary age  A kindly warmth diffusing youthful fires  Gild his dim eyes and paint with ruddy hue  His wrizzled visage ghastly wan before  Cordial restorative to mortal man  With copious hand by bounteous Gods bestow'd  Bacchus divine aid my adventurous song  That with no middle flight intends to soar  Inspir'd sublime on Pegasean wing  By thee upborn I draw Miltonic air  When fumy vapours clog our loaded brows  With furrow'd frowns when stupid downcast eyes  Th' external symptoms of remorse within  Our grief express or when in sullen dumps  With head incumbent on expanded palm  Moaping we sit in silent sorrow drown'd  Whether inveigling Hymen has trapann'd  Th' unwary youth and tied the Gordian knot  Of jangling wedlock indissoluble  Worried all day by loud Xantippe's din  Who fails not to exalt him to the stars  And fix him there among the branched crew  Taurus and Aries and Capricorn  The greatest monsters of the Zodiac  Or for the loss of anxious worldly pelf  Or Celia's scornful slights and cold disdain  Had check'd his amorous flame with coy repulse  The worst events that mortals can befal  By cares depress'd in pensive hyppish mood  With slowest pace the tedious minutes roll  Thy charming sight but much more charming gust  New life incites and warms our chilly blood  Strait with pert looks we raise our drooping fronts  And pour in crystal pure thy purer juice  With cheerful countenance and steady hand  Raise it liphigh then fix the spacious rim  To th' expecting mouth and now with grateful taste  The ebbing wine glides swiftly o'er the tongue  The circling blood with quicker motion flies  Such is thy powerful influence thou strait  Dispell'st those clouds that lowering dark eclips'd  The whilom glories of our gladsome face  And dimpled cheeks and sparkling rolling eyes  Thy cheering virtues and thy worth proclaim  So mists and exhalations that arise  From hills or steamy lake dusky or grey  Prevail till Phoebus sheds Titanian rays  And paints their fleecy skirts with shining gold  Unable to resist the foggy damps  That veil'd the surface of the verdant fields  At the god's penetrating beams disperse  The earth again in former beauty smiles  In gaudiest livery drest all gay and clear  When disappointed Strephon meets repulse  Scoff'd at despis'd in melancholic mood  Joyless he wastes in sighs the lazy hours  Till reinforc'd by thy almighty aid  He storms the breach and wins the beauteous fort  To pay thee homage and receive thy blessings  The British mariner quits his native shore  And ventures thro' the trackless vast abyss  Plowing the ocean while the upheav'd oak  With beaked prow rides tilting o'er the waves  Shock'd by tempestuous

MISS EW  THE stars obscur'd from view retire  And silver Cynthia frighted flies  The glorious sun again restores  His genial light to mortal eyes  And swiftly born by flaming steeds  In radiant majesty proceeds  But why in such unusual notes  Hails the sweet lark the opening dawn  Why does the thrush so sweetly pour  His grateful anthems to the morn  Why does the linnet's mellow strain  So early charm the listening plain  Nor thus the rose was wont to glow  Soft blooming in her verdant bed  Nor e'er the lilly's snowy pride  So sweetly hung the pensive head  Some glorious victory sure is won  By noble Rutland's nobler son  Dull bard methinks my Clio cries  And little skill'd in nature's lore  Canst thou this sweet effect ascribe  To such a horrid cause as war  The god of war in whirlwinds rides  And o'er the rapid storm presides  What tho' on Weser's goary banks  The British thunders fainter roll  What tho' each blast that wings the sky  Bears their loud cries from pole to pole  Returning conquest thou shalt see  And Granby's arm thy country free  Sublime o'er all the powers of heaven  Venus triumphant sits today  Swift thro' the trackless void of air  I saw her wing her rapid way  She flew to Norfolk's humble plains  With mirth to glad the jocund swains  On Idus' top young Cupid stands  High o'er his head with joyful air  He waves his bow and golden dart  And smiling cries ye swains beware  A nymph is born that shall sustain  The honour of my mystic reign  Behold in Sylvia's infant eyes  Bright beams with mildest lustre play  'Till years and growing strength shall wake  Their glories into perfect day  'Till then ye swains your hearts are free  But then ye must submit to me  Her in her tender years will I  From every early harm defend  And as she grows in strength and age  Still shall I prove her constant friend  Her beauties guard from timeless death  And blasting sickness' poisonous breath  And when three lustres shall be flown  And she in growing charms shall rise  Damon do thou prepare to sing  The daily conquests of her eyes  Thus shalt thou gain thy verdant lays  And happy wear it all thy days  ON THE DEATH OF MISS W  DArk was the night and dreary was the cell  And Boreas howl'd amid the leafless trees  When pensive Thyrsis took a sad farewell  Of worldly happiness and mental peace  One trembling lamp the absent day supplied  Low on the ground Lucinda's corpse was laid  On the green moss extended by his side  And decent cover'd with a linen shade  The mournful youth upon his hand reclin'd  On the pale damsel cast a gloomy look  His eyes betray'd the horrors of his mind  When thus low bending o'er the corpse he spoke  " Yield every passion yield to mighty woe  " Let clouds of grief my mournful soul o'erspread  " My ready tears in rapid torrents flow  " The last poor tribute that awaits the dead  " Fair as the morn and constant as the dove  " True as the hermit to the plighted vow  " All this thou wert sweet object of my love  " A gelid corpse a bieathless carcas now  " But ah what hopes thy beauteous bosom swell'd  " Vain hopes cut off by death's untimely blow  " The fates alas thy promis'd bliss withheld  " Ah too forgetful of th' approaching foe  " I thought to bear thee cross the watery plain  " Thy smiling brow had calm'd the roaring waves  " And love soft power that smooths the angry main  " Had chain'd the winds in subterraneous caves  " I thought to bear thee to my native land  " Where purer wheat the crouded granaries fills  " Where purling rivulets roll o'er golden sand  " And softly tumble from a thousand hills  " Alas poor wandering melancholy ghost  " Nor joy hast thou to know nor land to see  " But plaintive glid'st along the dreary coast  " Forgetful of the world and love and me  " Is this my joy is this the promis'd rest  " Ah no the fates have stopp'd thy labouring breath  " Thou liest not in my fond embraces prest  " But in the cold the icy arms of death  " Was it for this alas with ardent fire  " From her lov'd home I bore the beauteous maid  " Stole the lov'd offspring from her weeping sire  " And urg'd by love o'er northern hills convey'd  " Why did alas the hoary sage's voice  " Pronounce us blest or tie the sacred knot  " So soon to be dissolv'd or why my joys  " So soon commence so soon to be forgot  " Forgot ah no not till the purple blood  " Flows languid on or fails in every vein  " 'Till with my fair I cross the Stygian flood  " So long the pleasing anguish shall remain  " O horrid lonely melancholy grove  " No joys as once in you can Thyrsis see  " But whither would my thoughts unweeting rove  " Or why reflects my soul on aught but thee  " But see the sun advances in the east  " And early songsters hail th'approach of morn  " Brisk he returns from Thetis' downy breast  " But not to me my usual joys return  " Watch then ye swains the foe perhaps is near  " But why on foreign subjects do I dwell  " Take thy last look O Thyrsis of thy fair  " Farewell sweet nymph eternally farewell"  He said his ready tears obedient flow  While o'er the pallid corse he ceaseless mourn'd  He rav'd he groan'd and with wild acts of woe  All sad and pensive to his cot return'd  BARREAUX'S CELEBRATED SONNET GRAND DIEU TES JUGEMENS c TRANSLATED  GReat God thy judgments are supremely right  And in thy creatures bliss is thy delight  But

WINDOW AT CHALFONT IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE WHERE MILTON RESIDED DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THAT CALAMITY  FAir mirror of foul times whose fragile sheen  Shall as it blazeth break while providence  Aye

in his youth was at Florence he fell in love with a young lady and as she understood no English he writ some verses to her in Italian of which the above is the sense    WHen in your language I unskill'd address  The shortpac'd efforts of a tramell'd muse  Soft Italy's fair critics round me press  And my mistaking passion thus accuse  Why to our tongue's disgrace does thy dumb love  Strive in rough sound soft meaning to impart  He must select his words who speaks to move  And point his purpose at the hearer's heart  Then laughing they repeat my languid lays  Nymphs of thy native clime perhapsthey cry  For whom thou hast a tongue may feel thy praise  But we must understand e'er we comply  Do thou my soul's soft hope these triflers awe  Tell them 'tis nothing how or what I writ  Since Love from silent looks can language draw  And scorns the lame impertinence of wit  TO MR JOHN MILTON ON HIS POEM ENTITLED PARADISE LOST  O thou the wonder of the present age  An age immerst in luxury and vice  A race of triflers who can relish naught  But the gay issue of an idle brain  How could'st thou hope to please this tinsel race  Tho' blind yet with the penetrating eye  Of intellectual light thou dost survey  The labyrinth perplex'd of heaven's decrees  And with a quill pluck'd from an angel's wing  Dipt in the fount that laves th' eternal throne  Trace the dark paths of providence divine  " And justify the ways of God to Man"  FC  ON BENTLEY'S EMENDATIONS OF MILTON  WHen Milton's forfeit life was in debate  Some urg'd his crime and some th' unsettled state  Lord

BETWIXT OLIVER CROMWELL AND THE STATES OF HOLLAND IN MDCLIV  BY THE CELEBRATED MR LOCKE  IF Greece with so much mirth did entertain  Her Argo coming laden home again  With what loud mirth and triumph shall we greet  The wish'd approaches of our wellcome fleet  When of that prize our ships do us possess  Whereof their fleece was but an emblem Peace  Whose wellcome voice sounds sweeter in our ears  Than the loud music of the warbling spheres  And ravishing more than those doth plainly show  That sweetest harmony we to discord owe  Each seaman's voice pronouncing peace doth charm  And seems a syren's but it has less harm  And danger in't and yet like theirs doth please  Above all other and make us love the seas  W' have heaven in this peace like souls above  W' have nought to do now but admire and love  Glory of war is victory but here  Both glorious be 'cause neither's conqueror  'Thad been less honour if it might be said  They fought with those that could be conquered  Our reunited seas like streams that grow  Into one river do the smoother flow  Where ships no longer grapple but like those  The loving seamen in embraces close  We need no fireships now a nobler flame  Of love doth us protect whereby our name  Shall shine more glorious a flame as pure  As those of heaven and shall as long endure  This shall direct our ships and he that steers  Shall not consult heaven's fires but those he bears  In his own breast let Lilly threaten wars  While this conjunction lasts we'll fear no stars  Our ships are now most beneficial grown  Since they bring home no spoils but what's their own  Unto whose branchless pines our forward spring  Owes better fruit than autumn's wont to bring  Which give not only gems and Indian ore  But add at once whole nations to our store  Nay if to make a world's but to compose  The difference of things and make them close  In mutual amity and cause peace to creep  Out of the jarring chaos of the deep  Our ships do this so that while others take  Their course about the world ours a world make  TO OLIVER CROMWELL ON THE SAME SUBJECT  BY THE SAME  PAX regit Augusti quem vicit Julius orbem  Ille sago factus clarior ille togâ  Hos sua Roma vocat Magnos et numina credit  Hic quod sit mundi Victor et ille Quies  Tu bellum ut pacem populis das unus utris{que}  Major es ipse orbem vincis et ipse regis  Nos hominem e coelo missum te credimus unus  Sic poteras binos qui superare deos  TRANSLATED BY THE SAME  A Peaceful sway the great Augustus bore  O'er what great Julius gain'd by arms before  Julius was all with martial trophies crown'd  Augustus for his peaceful arts renown'd  Rome calls them Great and makes them Deities  That for his valour This his policies  You mighty prince than both are greater far  Who rule in peace that world you gain'd by war  You sure from heaven a finish'd hero fell  Who thus alone two Pagan Gods excell  ON A FAN  BY BISHOP ATTERBURY  FLavia the least and slightest toy  Can with resistless art employ  This fan in meaner hands would prove  An engine of small force in love  Yet she with graceful air and mien  Not to be told or safely seen  Directs its wanton motion so  That it wounds more than Cupid's bow  Gives coolness to the matchless dame  To every other breast a flame  THE NINTH ODE OF HORACE BOOK III A DIALOGUE BETWEEN HORACE AND LYDIA  TRANSLATED BY THE SAME  HORACE  WHile I was fond and you were kind  Nor any dearer youth reclin'd  On your soft bosom sought to rest  Not Persia's monarch was so blest  LYDIA  While you ador'd no other face  Nor lov'd me in the second place  Your Lydia's celebrated fame  Outshone the Roman Ilia's name  HORACE  Me Chloe now possesses whole  Her voice and lyre command my soul  Nor would I death itself decline  Could I redeem her life with mine  LYDIA  For me young lovely Calais burns  And warmth for warmth my heart returns  Twice would I life for him resign  Could his be ransom'd thus with mine  HORACE  What if the God whose bands we broke  Again should tame us to the yoke  What if my Chloe cease to reign  And Lydia her lost power regain  LYDIA  Tho' Phosphor be less fair than he  Thou wilder than the raging sea  Lighter than down yet gladly I  With thee would live with thee would die  THE THIRD ODE OF HORACE BOOK IV TO HIS MUSE  BY THE SAME  HE on whose birth the Lyric Queen  Of numbers smil'd shall never grace  The Isthmian gauntlet or be seen  First in the fam'd Olympic race  He shall not after toils of war  And humbling haughty monarchs pride  With laurell'd brows conspicuous far  To Jove's Tarpeian temple ride  But him the streams that warbling flow  Rich Tiber's fertile meads along  And shady groves his haunts shall know  The master of th' Aeolian song  The sons of Rome majestic Rome  Have fix'd me in the poet's choir  And Envy now or dead or dumb  Forbears to blame what they admire  Goddess of the sweetsounding lute  Which thy harmonious touch obeys  Who can'st the finny race tho' mute  To cygnets dying accents raise  Thy gift it is that all with ease  My new unrivall'd honours own  That still I live and living please  O Goddess is thy gift alone  IN HIS BANISHMENT  BY THE SAME  Thus on the banks of Seine  Far from my native home I pass my hours  Broken with years and pain yet my firm heart  Regards my friends and country even in death  BY THE SAME  THus where the Seine thro' realms of slavery strays  With sportive verse I sing my tedious days  Far from Britannia's happy climate torn  Bow'd down with age and with diseases worn  Yet even in death I act a steady part  And still my friends and country share my heart  AN EPIGRAM ON REFUSING BISHOP ATTERBURY A PUBLIC FUNERAL  HIS foes when dead great Atterbury lay  Shrunk at his name and trembled at his clay  Ten thousand dangers to their eyes appear  Great as their guilt and certain as their fear  T'insult a deathless corse alas is vain  Well for themselves and well employ'd their pain  Could they secure himnot to rise again  THE FORCE OF LOVE  BY MR ABRAHAM COWLEY PRESERV'D FORM AN OLD MANUSCRIPT  THrow an apple up a hill  Down the apple tumbles still  Roll it down it never stops  'Till within the vale it drops  So are all things prone to love  All below and all above  Down the mountain flows the stream  Up ascends the lambent flame  Smoke and vapour mount the skies  All preserve their unities  Nought below and nought above  Seems averse but prone to love  Stop the meteor in its flight  Or the orient rays of light  Bid Dan Phoebus not to shine  Bid the planets not incline  'Tis as vain below above  To impede the course of love  Salamanders live in fire  Eagles to the skies aspire  Diamonds in their quarries lie  Rivers do the sea supply  Thus appears below above  A propensity to love  Metals grow within the mine  Luscious grapes upon the vine  Still the needle marks the pole  Parts are equal to the whole  'Tis a truth as clear that Love  Quickens all below above  Man is born to live and die  Snakes to creep and birds to fly  Fishes in the waters swim  Doves are mild and lions grim  Nature thus below above  Pushes all things on to Love  Does the cedar love the mountain  Or the thirsty deer the fountain  Does the shepherd love his crook  Or the willow court the brook  Thus by Nature all things move  Like a running stream to love  Is the valiant hero bold  Does the miser doat on gold  Seek the birds in spring to pair  Breathes the rosebud scented air  Should you this deny you'll prove  Nature is averse to love  As the wencher loves a lass  As the toper loves his glass  As the friar loves his cowl  Or the miller loves the toll  So do all below above  Fly precipitate to Love  When young maidens courtship shun  When the moon outshines the sun  When the tygers lambs beget  When the snow is black as jet  When the planets cease to move  Then shall Nature cease to love  IMITATION OF THEOCRITUS  BY THE LATE MR JAMES HERVEY  WHen snows descend and robe the fields  In winter's bright array  Touch'd by the sun the lustre fades  And weeps itself away  When spring appears when violets blow  And shed a rich perfume  How soon the fragrance breathes its last  How shortliv'd is the bloom  Fresh in the morn the summerrose  Hangs withering ere 'tis noon  We scarce enjoy the balmy gift  But mourn the pleasure gone  With gliding fire an evening star  Streaks the autumnal skies  Shook from the sphere it darts away  And in an instant dies  Such are the charms that flush the cheeks  And sparkle in the eye  So from the lovely finish'd form  The transient graces fly  To this the seasons as they roll  Their attestation bring  They warn the fair their every round  Confirms the truth I sing  IMITATED FROM CASIMIR  BY THE SAME  CHild of the summer charming rose  No longer in confinement lie  Arise to light thy form disclose  Rival the spangles of the sky  The rains are gone the storms are o'er  Winter retires to make thee way  Come then thou sweetlyblushing flower  Come lovely stranger come away  The sun is dress'd in beaming smiles  To give thy beauties to the day  Young zephyrs wait with gentlest gales  To fan thy bosom as they play  JUVENAL IMITATED  BY THE SAME  SInce all the downward tracts of time  God's watchful eye surveys  O who so wise to chuse our lot  And regulate our ways  Since none can doubt his equal love  Unmeasurably kind  To his unerring gracious will  Be every wish resign'd  Good when he gives supremely good  Nor less when he denies  Even crosses from his sovereign hand  Are blessings in disguise  DR WYNTER TO DR CHEYNE  TEll me from whom fatheaded Scot  Thou didst thy system learn  From Hippocrate thou hadst it not  Nor Celsus nor Pitcairn  Suppose we own that milk is good  And say the same of grass  The one for babes is only food  The other for an ass  Doctor one new prescription try  A friend's advice forgive  Eat grass reduce thyself and die  Thy patients then may live  DR CHEYNE TO DR WYNTER  MY system doctor is my own  No tutor I pretend  My blunders hurt myself alone  But yours your dearest friend  Were you to milk and straw confin'd  Thrice happy might you be  Perhaps you might regain your mind  And from your wit get free  I can't your kind prescription try  But heartily forgive  'Tis natural you should bid me die  That you yourself may live  AN ELEGY WRITTEN AMONG THE RUINS OF A NOBLEMAN'S SEAT IN CORNWALL  BY MR MOORE  AMidst these venerable drear remains  Of antient grandeur musing sad I stray  Around a melancholy silence reigns  That prompts me to indulge the plaintive lay  Here liv'd Eugenio born of noble race  Aloft his mansion rose around were seen  Extensive gardens deck'd with every grace  Ponds walks and groves thro' all the seasons green  Ah where is now its boasted beauty fled  Proud turrets that once glitter'd in the sky  And broken columns in confusion spread  A rude misshapen heap of ruins lie  Of splendid rooms no traces here are found  How are these tottering walls by time defac'd  Shagg'd with vile thorn with twining ivy bound  Once hung with tapestry with paintings grac'd  In antient times perhaps where now I tread  Licentious Riot crown'd the midnightbowl  Her dainties Luxury pour'd and Beauty spread  Her artful snares to captivate the soul  Or here attended by a chosen train  Of innocent delight true Grandeur dwelt  Diffusing blessings o'er the distant plain  Health joy and happiness by thousands felt  Around now Solitude unjoyous reigns  No gaygilt chariot hither marks the way  No more with cheerful hopes the needy swains  At the oncebounteous gate their visits pay  Where too is now the garden's beauty fled  Which every clime was ransack'd to supply  O'er the drear spot see desolation spread  And the dismantled walls in ruins lie  Dead are the trees that once with nicest care  Arrang'd from opening blossoms shed perfume  And thick with fruitage stood the pendent pear  The ruddycolour'd peach and glossy plumb  Extinct is all the family of flowers  In vain I seek the arbour's cool retreat  Where antient friends in converse pass'd the hours  Defended from the raging dogstar's heat  Along the terrasswalks are straggling seen  The prickly bramble and the noisome weed  Beneath whose covert crawls the toad obscene  And snakes and adders unmolested breed  The groves where Pleasure walk'd her rounds decay  The mead untill'd a barren aspect wears  And where the sprightly fawn was wont to play  O'ergrown with heath a dreary waste appears  In yonder wideextended vale below  Where osiers spread a pond capacious stood  From far by art the stream was taught to flow  Whose liquid stores supplied th' unfailing flood  Oft here the silent angler took his place  Intent to captivate the scaly fry  But perish'd now are all the numerous race  Dumb is the fountain and the channel dry  Here then ye Great behold th' uncertain state  Of earthly grandeurbeauty strength and power  Alike are subject to the stroke of fate  And flourish but the glory of an hour  Virtue alone no dissolution fears  Still permanent tho' ages roll away  Who builds on her immortal basis rears  A superstructure time can ne'er decay  TH TO SIR HANS SLOANE  SInce you dear doctor sav'd my life  By turns to bless and curse my wife  In conscience I'm oblig'd to do  What your commands enjoin'd me to  According then to your command  That I should search the western land  And send you all that I can find  Of curious things of every kind  I've ravag'd air earth sea and caverns  Wine women children tombs and taverns  And greater rarities can shew  Than Gresham's children ever knew  Which carrier Dick shall bring you down  Next time the waggon comes to town  First I have drops of the same shower  Which Jove in Danae's lap did pour  From Carthage brought the sword I'll send  That help'd queen Dido to her end  The snakeskin which you may believe  The serpent cast who tempted Eve  A figleaf apron 'tis the same  Which Adam wore to hide his shame  But now wants darning sir beside  The jaw by which poor Abel died  A whetstone worn exceeding small  Which Time hath whet his teeth withal  The pigeon stuft which Noah sent  To tell which way the waters went  A ring I've got of Sampson's hair  The same which Dalilah did wear  St Dunstan's tongs as story goes  That pinch'd the Devil by the nose  The very shaft as all may see  Which Cupid shot at Anthony  And what beyond them all I prize  A glance of Cleopatra's eyes  Some strains of eloquence which hung  In Roman times on Tully's tongue  Which long conceal'd and lost had lain  'Till Cowper found them out again  Then I've most curious to be seen  A scorpion's bite to cure the spleen  As Moore cures worms in stomach bred  I've pills cure maggots in the head  With the receipt how you may make 'em  To you I leave the time to take 'em  I've got a ray of Phoebus' shine  Found in the bottom of a mine  A lawyer's conscience large and clear  Fit for a judge himself to wear  I've choice of nostrums how to make  An oath which churchmen will not take  In a thumbvial you shall see  Closestopt some drops of honesty  Which after searching kingdoms round  At last was in a cottage found  I ha'n't collected any care  Of that there's plenty everywhere  But after wondrous labour spent  I've got three grains of rich content  It is my wish it is my glory  To furnish your nicknackatory  I only beg that when you show 'em  You'll fairly tell to whom you owe 'em  Which will your future patients teach  To do as has done your's  TH  J BRAMSTON TO CAPTAIN HINTON  HInton old friend accept from me  The following rules without a fee  An asthma is your case I think  So you must neither eat nor drink  I mean of meats preserv'd in salt  Nor any liquor made of malt  From season'd sauce avert your eyes  From hams and tongues and pigeonpies  If venisonpasty's set before you  Each bit you eatmemento mori  Your suppers nothing if you please  But above all no toasted cheese  And now perhaps you may observe  What I prescribe will make you starve  NoI allow you at a meal  A leg a loin or neck of veal  Young turkiesI allow you four  Partridge and pullets half a score  Of houselamb boil'd eat quarters two  The devil's in't if this wont do  Now as to liquorwhy indeed  What I prescribe I send youMead  Glasses of wine t'extinguish drought  Take three with water three without  Let constant exercise be tried  And sometimes walk and sometimes ride  Health oftner comes from Blackdownhill  Than from th' apothecary's bill  Some if they are not cur'd at once  Proclaim their doctor for a dunce  Restless from quack to quack they range  When 'tis themselves they ought to change  Rules and restraints you must endure  What comes by time 'tis time must cure  The use of vegetables try  And prize Pomona in a pie  Young Bacchus' rites you must avoid  And Venus must go unenjoy'd  Whate'er you take put something good in  And worship Ceres in a pudding  For breakfast it is my advice  Eat sago gruel barley rice  Take burdock roots and by my troth  I'd mingle daizes in my broth  Thus may you draw with ease your breath  Deluding what you dread not death  Thus may you laugh look clear and thrive  Enrich'd by those whom you survive  May dying friends with one accord  Worth and Sincerity reward  A THOUGHT FROM MARCUS ANTONINUS  WHat shall the causeless curse of fools controul  Thy wavering virtue and debase thy soul  Reproach'd or censur'd as an useless thing  Still pure and constant flows the healing spring  Still pours its bounty with a sweet excess  Th' invidious tongue with cooling draughts to bless  Should thankless hands with clay pollute the tide  Will the stain'd waters stagnant cease to glide  No still they flow by flowing still refine  Diffuse new blessings with new lustre shine  Taught by the spring then bounteous be thy mind  By thanks unpaid be generously kind  The streams of charity no taint can know  'Till stopp'd refining ever as they flow  GARDEN INSCRIPTIONS  BY WILLIAM THOMPSON MA LATE FELLOW OF QUEEN'S COLLEGE OXON  I  The two first inscriptions are in the measure of Spenser's sonnets  IN IL SPENSEROSO ON SPENSER'S FAERIE QUEENE  LO here the place for contemplation made  For sacred musing and for solemn song  Hence ye profane nor violate the shade  Come Spenser's awful genius come along  Mix with the music of th' aerial throng  Oh breathe a pensive stillness thro' my breast  While balmy breezes pant the leaves among  And sweetly sooth my passions into rest  Hint purest thoughts in purest colours drest  Even such as angels prompt in golden dreams  To holy hermit high in raptures blest  His bosom burning with celestial beams  Ne less the raptures of my summer day  If Spenser deign with me to moralize the lay  II IN THE SAME ON SPENSER'S SHEPHERD'S CALENDAR  AT large beneath this floating foliage laid  Of circling green the crystal running by  How soft the murmur and how cool the shade  While gentlewhispering winds their breath apply  To 'swage the fever of the sultry sky  Smit with the sweet  Theocritus  Sicilian's simple strain  I try the rural reed but fondly try  To match his pastoral airs and happy vein  Next I assay the quill of  Virgil  Mantua's swain  Of bolder note and of more courtly grace  Ah foolish emulationThey disdain  My awkward skill and push me from the place  Yet boast not thou of Greece nor thou of Rome  My sweeter  Spenser  Colin Clout outpipes you both at home  III IN SHAKESPEAR'S WALK  BY yon hills with morning spread  Lifting up the tufted head  By those golden waves of corn  Which the laughing fields adorn  By the fragrant breath of flowers  Stealing from the woodbinbowers  By this thoughtinspiring shade  By the gleamings of the glade  By the babbling of the brook  Winding slow in many a crook  By the rustling of the trees  By the humming of the bees  By the woodlark by the thrush  Wildly warbling from the bush  By the fairy's shadowy tread  O'er the cowslip's dewy head  Father monarch of the stage  Glory of Eliza's age  Shakespear deign to lend thy face  This romantic nook to grace  Where untaught Nature sports alone  Since thou and Nature are but one  IV IN MILTON'S ALCOVE  HEre mighty Milton in the blaze of noon  Amid the broad effulgence here I fix  Thy radiant tabernacle Nought is dark  In thee thou bright companion of the sun  Thus thy own Uriel in its centre stands  Illustrious waving glory

Celestes inter coetus pulcherrimus ille  Mortales inter veluti tu maximus omnes  VI ON LAUREL HILL AT THE END OF THE GARDEN TO MR POPE  O skill'd thy every reader's breast to warm  To lull with harmony with sense to charm  To call the glowing soul into the ear  And now we live and now we die to hear  Born on the waves of melody along  Exulting shout and triumph in thy song  O Pope the sweetest of the tuneful race  This votive tablet grateful here I place  Here where the Graces sport on Laurel Hill  Fast by the music of the murmuring rill  From hence the blueish Barkshire hills survey  Which oft have echoed to thy sylvan lay  When young in Windsor's blissful fields you stray'd  Immortal by your deathless labours made  There the first music trembled from thy tongue  And  Mr Pope lived at Binfield in Windsor Forest Barkshire where he wrote the most poetical of all his admirable works  Binfield swains on every accent hung  The larks the sweetness of thy notes confest  And dumb with envy sunk into their nest  While In soft silence  A river celebrated in Pope's Windsor Forest  Loddon stole along  And listening wonder'd at thy softer song  Nor scorn the prospects which Oxonia yields  Her hills as verdant and as fair her fields  As rich her vallies and her streams as clear  And Phoebus haunts andthou hast charm'd us  Mr Pope used frequently to visit Oxford he likewise translated part of Homer at Stanton Harcourt in this County as appears from an inscription in one of the windows there  here  For other busts a single wreath I wove  But dedicate to thine my  I would not have it imagined by these lines that I equalled Pope to the great triumvirate Spenser Shakespear and Milton who will reign a triumvirate for ever it is honour enough to the greatest poets even to mr Pope to be placed next to them  Laurel Grove  VII IN CHAUCER'S BOURE  WHO is this thilke old bard which wonneth here  This thilke old bard sirs is Dan Chaucer  Full gentle knight was he in

waving of the trees  And the fanning of the breeze  O the prattling of the rill  Still supplied and prattling still  O the Zephyrs sweetly playing  As when first they go a Maying  O the birds for ever

crimson folds unloose  And blush resulgent in the purple dews  The lilly he arrays with spotless white  Rich in its mantle of inwoven light  Go Solomon and cast thy gems aside  Nor glory in thy poverty of pride  The painted tribes their sunny robes display  And lend a lucid softness to the day  Grateful each flower to heaven its incense pays  And breathes its fragrant soul away in praise  Oh thither may they teach my soul to soar  Confess our Maker and his steps adore  Contented let me live submissive die  And hope a fairer Paradise on high  XI IN  The arbour is called Golden Grove because bishop Taylor wrote several of his most excellent and pious works at Golden Crove in Wales the seat of his great patron the earl of Carbery He has on that account a book of devotions called Golden Grove  GOLDEN GROVE  WHat pleasing form commands the lifted eye  O say what younger brother of the sky  I know my Taylor's mild auspicious grace  And  Bishop Taylor was so extremely handsome and beautiful in his youth that archbishop Laud thought him almost an angel from heaven when he first saw and heard him in the pulpit See bishop Rust's sermon preached at bishop Taylor's funeral  more than human sweetness in his face  The light of Faith around his eyeballs plays  And Hope and Charity unite their rays  What  His excellent treatises are highly valued for the exactness of wit profoundness of judgment richness of fancy copiousness of invention and general usefulness to all the purposes of a Christian After the restoration he was made bishop of Down and Connor where he

curâ coluit  Et cultu cecinit  Non umbram non unum nemus  Sed hortum  DD  SHall poets dignify my walks and bowers  Cowley forgot forbid it rural powers  Ye rural powers your choicest treasures shed  To form a garland for your Cowley's head  Collect the radiance of the showery bow  The rose's scarlet and the lilly's snow  To emulate his works confus'dly bright  Where glories rise on glories light on light  The prism of wit Apollo once before  So gilded Donn but so could gild no more  Our moderns flow 'tis true in easy rhimes  But will our moderns flow thro' future times  Warm distant ages with their glorious fire  Inspir'd themselves and potent to inspire  Cowley this praise is thinean age is past  Yet still you charm the present as the last  Your thoughts your verse their pristine lustre hold  Like rows of jewels rang'd on cloth of gold  Aeneas' passport thus the golden bough  Solid and bright at once resembles you  Like that you lead us to Elysium too  No muddy streams of dull pollution run  In your chaste lines each wanton hint you shun  Save when a transient Venus blots the sun  You sung each flower that spreads the vivid hue  Each healing plant that sips the silver dew  Each tree that decks the garden or the grove  You sung but never felt the fires of Love  For Love too witty and from passion free  You had your mistress but no lover she  Goaded with points Love never wept so sore  Tho' wounded by a Muse's bee before  O master of the manychorded lyre  Whom all the Nine with all their gifts inspire  Next Spenser's bower accept this humble shed  He charm'd you living and you join him dead  But far I place thee from coy Daphne's tree  The tree that hates Apollo loves not thee  Yet had Apollo sung so well the maid  Had yielded nor been turn'd into a shade  XIII ON THE MOUNT UNDER MR ADDISON'S PICTURE  JUst to thy genius to thy virtues just  Next Virgil's Addison I place thy bust  Such finish'd graces shine in every page  Correctly bold and sober in your rage  So elegant with ease so justly warm  Both raise with rapture both with fancy charm  Your muse no sybil with distortion wild  Serene in majesty in glory mild  Your manly thoughts in manly robes array'd  No tinselglitter and no painted shade  Command our wonder while you march along  Consummate masters of immortal song  And hark what notes are stealing on my ear  Which dying saints might breathe or angels hear  As incense grateful to th' eternal king  And such as Addison alone could sing  Blush Vice if Vice can blush and hide thy face  A wicked wit is Nature's last disgrace  Let Virgil Addison your patterns shine  Disdain pollution and commence divine  Hail both unenvied and unequall'd pair  Your happily divided honours share  And thou my mount on Pindus' top look down  Grac'd with a Virgil and an Addison  XIV ANOTHER UNDERNEATH  THE blissful scenes which Virgil's pencil drew  Unfolding all Elysium to the view  The rural scenes which Addison display'd  In beauteous Rosamonda's mazy shade

rests beneath the fragrant shade  Lull'd by the murmurs of the soft cascade  Ye shepherds carol here your lays of love  While pastoral music dies along the grove  Ye swains instructed by his grateful theme  His praises whistle to the tinkling stream  Ye bees around your tuneful master throng  And humming in delight his dreams prolong  But hence the trumpet's clang the din of war  The thunder of the battle hence be far  His bees swains shepherds more contentment yield  Than heroes blazing in the tented field  "  Arms and the man I sing Meaning the Aeneid  Arms and the man I sing" let others chuse  Give me the products of his rural muse  XVII BENEATH A VINE UNDER A PICTURE OF HORACE  BRing hither friend O hither bring  The lyre and let us sit and sing  Wake into life the dying flute  The Thracian harp or Lydian lute  Horace commands O quickly bring the lyre  For Horace master of the Roman choir  Cum flore Maecenas rosarum  Pressa tuis balanus capillis  HOR  Non desint epulis rosae  Neu breve lilium  HOR  With rosebuds grace the poet's brow  With odours bid his ringlets flow  These lillies crop and strew the ground  And let my temples too be crown'd  O fill the bowl beneath this mantling vine  For Horace arbiter of verse and wine  With social joys we raise the hour  But banish Cupid from the bower  Cujus octavum trepidavit aetas  Claudere lustrum  HOR  Seven lustres past ah why should I  And why should Horace pine and sigh  No more he beckons Pyrrha to the grot  His Lydia my Ianthe both forgot  True Lydia revell'd in his veins  And sweet Ianthe warm'd my strains  But age should youthful follies shun  Nor back the flowery mazes run  Let wit to wisdom love to friendship rise  And learn at last from Horace to grow wise  XVIII OVER THOMSON'S SEASONS  LO Thomson deigns to grace the bower I made  And dwell a tuneful tenant of my shade  Hail Nature's poet whom she taught alone  To sing her works in number's like her own  Sweet as the Thrush that warbles in the vale  And soft as Philomela's tender tale  She lent her pencil too of wondrous power  To catch the rainbow or to form the flower  Of manymingling hues and smiling said  But first with laurel crown'd her favourite's head  " These beauteous children tho' so fair they shine  " Fade in my Seasons let them live in thine  " And live they shall the charm of every eye  " 'Till Nature sickens and the Seasons die"  XIX IN THE MIDST OF AN APPLETREE OVER MR PHILIPS'S CYDER  IF he who first the apple sung "the fruit  Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste  Brought death into the world and all our woe"  Unfading laurels won a branch awaits  Philips thy youthful brow who apples sung  Innocuous and with freedom bad us quaff  Their generous nectar 'neath their parent shade  Adventrous nor in less inferior strains  Like Milton too you taught Britannia's song  To shake the shackles off of tinkling rhime  Emasculate unnervous female verse  Since modesty still modesty attends  On worth like thine forbids thee to accept  The parted wreath let Milton's be the first  Unrivall'd be the second honours thine  And now for Leo from his flaming mane  Shakes fultry rays intense provoking thirst  O Philips while my wellglaz'd tube exhales  Nicotian fragrance and my rummer shines  With cyder sparkling high partake my shade  Pleas'd with Pomona's haunts and cool recess  Her purplebreathing births sweetsmiling round  XX OVER YOUNG'S NIGHT THOUGHTS  BEneath an awful gloom a night of shade  By silent darkness more majestic made  I place thy volume Young with reverence place  Thy volume worthy of a saint's embrace  What gospeltruths thy heavenly lines convey  And steal us from mortality away  Full on the soul thy tides of rapture flow  Kindling we hear and while we read we glow  Exalted by thy theme we mount on high  We spurn at earth we claim our native sky  Now let th' unletter'd or the letter'd man  Deny the soul immortal if he can  A soul immortal in thy works we see  Can dust and ashes think and write like thee  Yes fools the soul shall live for God is just  Ye atheists ye old serpents lick the dust  Thro' depths of ether now his eagle flies  Gains on the sun and traverses the skies  Where stars on stars on planets planets roll  Imbibes their splendors and commands the pole  Onward he bears and burning soars away  Nor flag his pinions to mysterious day  O Newton far beyond thy highest sphere  Pursue my soul no furtherHeaven is here  Oppress'd with glory all my senses fade  I faintO softly lay me in his shade  INSCRIPTION IN A SUMMERHOUSE BELONGING TO THE LATE GILBERT WEST ESQ AT WICKHAM IN KENT  HAEC mihi nec procul urbe sita est nec prorsus ad urbem  Ne patiar turbas utque bonis potiar  Et quoties mutare locum fastigia cogunt  Transeo et alternis rure vel urbe fruar  AUSON AD VILLAM  TRANSLATED BY MR WEST  NOT wrapt in smoky London's sulphurous clouds  And not far distant stands my rural cot  Neither obnoxious to intruding crouds  Nor for the good and friendly too remote  And when too much repose brings on the spleen  Or the gay city's idle pleasures cloy  Swift as my changing wish I shift the scene  And now the country now the town enjoy  AN EPITAPH IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD IN KENT  BY THE CELEBRATED MR G  LO where this silent marble weeps  A friend a wife a mother sleeps  A heart within whose sacred cell  The peaceful virtues lov'd to dwell  Affection warm and faith sincere  And soft humanity were there  In agony in death resign'd  She felt the wound she left behind  Her infant image here below  Sits smiling on a father's woe  Whom what awaits while thus he strays  Along the lonely vale of days  A pang to secret sorrow dear  A sigh an unavailing tear  'Till time shall every grief remove  With life with memory and with love  EPITAPH ON
