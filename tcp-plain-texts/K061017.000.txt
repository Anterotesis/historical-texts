 THE  Protestant Monastery  OR A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE Brutality of the present AGE  PARTICULARLY The PERTNESS and INSOLENCE of our YOUTH to aged PERSONS  WITH A CAUTION to People in Years how they give the STAFF out of their own Hands and leave themselves at the Mercy of others  CONCLUDING With a PROPOSAL for erecting a  PROTESTANT MONASTERY  where Persons of small Fortunes may end their Days in Plenty Ease and Credit without burthening their Relations or accepting Publick Charities  By ANDREW MORETON  Esq  Author of  EveryBody's Business is NoBody's Business  LONDON  Printed for  W Meadows  at the  Angel  in  Cornhill  and sold by  J Roberts  in  WarwickLane    E Nutt  under the  Royal Exchange    A Dodd  without  TempleBar  and  N Blanford  at  CharingCross  Price  d  THE PREFACE  _A COMMONWEALTH is a Machine actuated by many Wheels one dependant on the other yet the Obstruction of a small Wheel may stop the Motion of the whole Every Man ought therefore as much as in him lies to contribute in his Station to the publick Welfare and not be afraid or ashamed of doing or at least meaning well  I hope therefore the Reader will excuse the Vanity of an over officious  Old Man  if like  Cato  I enquire whether or no before  I go hence and be no more I can yet do any thing for the Service of my Country  For if every Man should say Children are burthensome and the Cause of many Sorrows therefore will not I be a Father farewel to all Ties of Nature and every Blessing of human Society  Or if every Man should say to himself what have I to do with State Affairs is it my Business are there not enough at the Helm what need I interfere Let me be subject to the Higher Powers and let Matters sink or swim I shall have Neighbours Fare  Would not this be a very churlish Resolution would it not very much contribute to universal Anarchy and Confusion should every Man thus throw the Care of the Publick from his shoulders and acquit himself of any Concern for the rest of Mankind  This would be my Case should I knowing I am Master of a Project which in all probability may be of great use to Mankind reason thus to my self what have I to do to divulge my Secrets What though they are of Benefit to the Publick shall I reap any Advantage by them Shall I not rather be laugh'd at and despised as a Projector the most contemptible Character in this Part of the World May not another run away with the Profits of my Labour and by a little Improvement make my Project his own is it not better for me to repose myself to die in Peace and leave an ungrateful World to their own Imaginations  Non nobis nati sumus  That Thought would quash all harsh Contemplations I could hazard with Pleasure the publick Contumely for the publick Good knowing it has been the Fate of much better Men than my self to be despised when living tho' rever'd when dead  Prompted by this Reflection I once more take Pen in Hand as I hope for the Service of my Country If my Countrymen find what I advance practicable I hope they will not call my Integrity in question and if they have patience to read my well intended Thoughts tho' digested I fear but too mildly and in too mean a Stile I hope they will find I have advanc'd nothing but what is practicable beneficial and without SelfInterest having excluded myself from any propriety in my own Project by thus publishing it and making it every Body's and if any think I write for Money let them ask my Bookseller  Alas I have but small Health and little Leisure to turn Author being now in my  th  Year almost worn out with Age and Sickness The  Old Man  cannot trouble you long take then in good part his best Intentions and impute his Defects to Age and Weakness Look on  him as a Man of more Experience than Learning excuse his Stile for the sake of his Subject and take the Will for the Deed Assure your self gentle Reader I had not published my Project in this Pamphlet could I have got it inserted in any of the Journals without Feeing the Journalists or Publishers  I cannot but have the Vanity to think they might as well have inserted what I sent them  Gratis  as many Things I have since seen in their Papers But I have not only had the Mortification to find what I sent rejected but to lose my Originals not having taken Copies of what I wrote  However to justify my Complaints to the World I shall in a proper Place let them know the Substance of what was rejected and by whom  In the mean time give me leave to assure my Readers that the Reason why this Project appears in a Pamphlet is because I have been thus baffled and disheartened by Journalists for if by any Means the Publick could have had it at a cheaper Rate I had been better pleased  THE Protestant Monastery  _THERE is nothing on Earth more shocking and withal more common in but too many Families than to see Age and Grey Hairs derided and ill used The OLD MAN or the OLD WOMAN can do nothing to please their Words are perverted their Actions misrepresented and themselves look'd upon as a Burthen to their Issue and a Rent Charge upon those who came from their Loins  This Treatment as it is directly opposite to the Dignity and Decency of Human Nature calls aloud for Redress the Helpless and innocent ought to be the care of the Healthy and able Shall a Man or Woman toil and moil to bring up a numerous Issue shall they rear up thro' all the Uncertainties and Fatigues of Childhood a Race who shall spring up but to  abandon them shall they enfeeble themselves to give Strength to those who shall one Day thrust them aside and despise them  Yet this is the Case of many aged Persons who have outlived the Comforts of this World who survive only to hear themselves wish'd out of the way by those very Persons upon whom they have bestowed their whole Substance and upon whom their whole Hopes have been fixed Uncertain Hopes indeed and far unfit for so degenerate an Age  Honour thy Father and thy Mother  is a Commandment given by God and ratified by our Blessed Saviour both in Precept and Example If so what Brutes are those who shall dare to spurn those Persons whom God has thought fit to make the Means of their Entrance into human Life  But indeed not only Parents but all aged People in general are thought to stand in the way of the present Generation and but for some good Children some Persons of Tenderness and Humanity who honour the hoary Head and comfort the Feeble immediate Vengeance would be pulled down on those who let not their Sires live out half their Days  The Word OLD is a standing Jest among our youthful Gentry When they would frighten Children they tell them  The old Man's a coming  Thus they inculcate an Abhorrence of Age even in sucking Babes which no doubt will improve with adult Age according to the Proverb  Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem  Testa diu  IF any whimsical or ridiculous Story is told 'tis of an  Old Woman  If any Person is aukward at his Business or any thing else he is called an  Old Woman  forsooth But this is no new thing for we read in former Ages that they made Witches of their Old Women Those were brave Days for young People when they could swear the old Ones out of their Lives and get a Woman hanged or burnt only for being a little too old as has been the Case of many a poor innocent ancient Creature The Story of the Witch  alias  the poor Old Woman of  Hertford  is yet fresh in every one's Memory and had not the very Judges on the Bench seen through the Enthusiasm and Obstinacy of the Evidence who swore thorough thick and thin had not the Judges themselves I say represented the thing in a right Light to the  Higher Powers  poor  Jane Wenman  had certainly been truss'd up as a Warning to all ancient Perfons who should dare to live longer than the young Ones think convenient  It is well it has never been in the young Ones Power to bring in a Bill for the better trimming of Mankind  i e  to knock all ancient People on the Head  But though they are suffered to live 'tis under many Hardships and Restrictions many Humps and Grumps and scarce a Day but they are ask'd what they do out of their Graves This is a very common but withal a most impious and unchristian Saying nay not only unchristian but even unmahometan For the very Infidels themselves pay more Veneration to old Age than the Christians do to the Shame and Scandal of our Holy Profession  Far be it from me to tax all Christians or all Children with so severe a Reproach No I only blame those who triumph in the Strength of their Youth and snuff up their Nostrils at  OldAge  Who laugh at the Groanings of the hoary Head and have no Bowels of Compassion for the Bowels that gave them Nourishment  Let such selfsufficient Persons consider that it was once in their Parents Power to have abandoned them when they were more helpless than any other Being to which  God had given Life When they must inevitably have perished without great Care and Tenderness and indeed the Divine Wisdom is most manifestly seen in making Man the Chief of all his earthly Creatures to require so delicate a Management and so tender a Nourishment parental Love being encreas'd by its Care as filial Love ought to be by a Gratitude for that Care it can never too much acknowledge or repay  All Creatures whom God has ordained to quit their Sires or indeed those whom he has not endow'd with a rational Soul to distinguish between good and bad or to know Duty or Obligation are easily brought up and can help themselves better the Hour they are born than Man can in a whole Year nay in Years They perform all the necessary Functions of Life and there is no need of Education Far otherwise is it with Man he in his Infancy requires a constant and careful Attendance his Members know not their Functions and it is a long while before he can feed himself even then his Parents have the Care for his Food When the Body is duly nourished there is yet a further Care to form the Mind and cultivate the rational Soul God had endow'd him with  Shall such a Being possest of a rational Soul to distinguish between Good and Bad between Gratitude and Ingratitude so far debase himself or indeed become so much a Brute as to forsake his Parent to spurn him who begot him or at least by using him ill to elbow him as it were out of the World to give himself the greater Scope for Luxury  Yet how many do we see of such how many truly compassionate Hearts daily bleed when they see the Son curbing the Father or the Daughter snubbing the Mother It seems as if the Order of Nature were perverted So shocking is it to any Soul who has the least Tincture of Humanity  I am sure I speak by Experience for but very lately I went to see an old SchoolFellow and Acquaintance of mine who had lately married his Daughter and settled himself in her Family accordingly he gave me a general Invitation to come one Day or other and take a Dinner with him he had been a Merchant from his Youth and always liv'd in what we call high Life had travell'd much and was Master of the most good Manners I ever met with  This Gentleman being very weary and indeed almost incapable of Business thought it best to leave off House keeping to marry his Daughter and settle in her Family Accordingly  he gave her his All for her Portion made her a Fortune of Pounds and match'd her to an eminent Merchant who us'd the same Trade with himself  During the HoneyMoon and till the Portion was paid the Old Gentleman liv'd in Clover nothing was too hot or too heavy for him 'Twas  Dear Sir Dear Father  at every Word the Servants were ordered to respect him and he was in some Share Master of the Family but alas he found this but a shortliv'd Dream the Servants began to taunt at him and he must call twenty Times for a thing before he could have it If he gently chid 'em or reason'd with them they flew to their Mistress and made twenty Stories about it so that his Life was in a manner a Burthen to him  I went in my Chariot to see him and had not the little Appearance I made commanded fome respect I had danc'd Attendance till they should find in their Hearts to call him However without much Ceremony they directed me up three pair of Stairs into a better sort of a Garret there might be indeed some LodgingRooms over Head for the Servants but I have seen many Servants have much better Appartments but the Room would not have so much surpriz'd me had the Furniture  been any thing tollerable I dare swear it was as old as the House and had no doubt pass'd from Tenant to Tenant half a score Times  This I thought an odd Residence for my Friend but he seem'd contented and I saw no Reason I had to make him otherwise He amused me till Dinner time with shewing me his Books and reading some of his Verses to me as having a pretty Knack that way he would have play'd me a Lesson on his Flute but that he said it would disturb his Daughter who did not love Musick I saw that all his little Arts were only to beguile the Time lest a Whet before Dinner which I never mist at his House should be expected and which I believe was now out of his Power to give At last the Bell rang and he desired me to walk down to Dinner but with an Air that seem'd chidingly to say Ah why did you not come sooner when I had more Authority However with a long Apology to his Son and Daughter he introduced me and by pleading our long and intimate Acquintance and the Obligations he was under to me he prevail'd on them at last to bid me a very ceremonious Welcome Excusing themselves as indeed they had need that they had not made a proper Provision and pleading their Ignorance of my coming  accordingly down we sate to some cold RoastBeef a few Herrings and a Plate of Fritters Every thing was indeed very clean and we had Attendance enough but never in my Life made I a worse Dinner Herrings are my aversion I never eat cold Meat judge then what a Belly full I could make of my share of the Fritters I happened by Mistake to call for a Glass of Wine without which I never dine when the Gentleman told me he had none in the House but if I pleas'd he would send for some recommending at the same time some of his Homebrew'd Ale which I in Complaisance could not but accept in Preference to Wine They took me at my Word and with much ado I got down half a Glass of the worst Potion I ever took in my Life but had the Dinner been never so elegant my indignation would have spoil'd my Stomach to hear the Daughter at every turn take up her Father in his Discourse as if he had been an Idiot or an underling with  Oh fye Sir  and  I wonder Father you should say so  But lest the Readers by my Recital of the Lady's Phrases should think my Friend spake ludicrously or indecently I beg Leave to assure them the contrary and that he is a Man of great Wit and strict Modesty Even the Son who was the least Severe upon him could not refrain contradicting  him every now and then meerly for contradiction sake with  Pray Sir give me Leave  and  indeed Sir you have forgot your self  this was my whole Entertainment For my Part I said little but admired not only at this wondrous Frugality but the surprizing Impertinence and Ingratitude of of the young Couple However I was undeceived at last as I hope my Readers will be when I assure them that the Reason why  Sir  and  Madam  eat so sparingly with us was because they had devour'd in Hugger Mugger by themselves a good handsome Fowl and Oyster Sauce and dispens'd with a Bottle of Wine though they could drink none in our Company  Seeing this penurious Management and the Awe my poor Friend was in I thought it best to adjourn to the Tavern to smoak a Pipe and withal to take a Glass to warm my Stomach which rak'd prodigiously I had before learn'd that the poor old Soul had been oblig'd to leave off Smoaking because forsooth his spitting and spawling turn'd  Madam  's Stomach his smoaking she said made the House stink and damaged the Furniture He had been from his Youth a great Smoaker and this sudden Check upon a Habit of so long standing had very much impair'd his Health  Accordingly to the Tavern we went where a Pipe and a Bottle gave new Life to my old Acquaintance he resum'd his native Gayety and eleven of the Clock stole upon us before we could think of Parting and even then but with great Reluctance so agreeably did the Time pass away in recounting our old Adventures Indeed our sweet was intermix'd with sour for his poor Heart was so full he could not contain himself from lodging his Sorrows in the Bosom of his old Friend With Tears in his Eyes he recounted all the Indignities he daily met with not only from his own Children but from the very Servants If he spake to them as to Servants his Daughter would take him up and tell him he domineer'd too much in her House If he spake submissively he was told he had no occasion to make himself so little insomuch that he knew not what Medium to take  He told me his Daughter had lately a ChamberMaid who was the Daughter of a decay'd Gentleman and who having had a tolerable Education had imbib'd high Notions of Virtue and amongst other things an Abhorrence of undutifulness in Children or indeed any disrespect in old Age This young Woman having learn'd in what Fashion my Friend had once liv'd could not without Indignation see how ill  he was treated and being of a good Family her self scorn'd to take Part with the other Servants to torment a poor old Man but on the contrary would do him all the Christian Offices she could would constantly get him something warm in a Morning and if he was out of Order at any time would tend him and do him a thousand little Services for which he in Recompence when her Lady was gone a Visiting would read to the Girl a whole Afternoon together while she sat at Work And as so many good Offices must consequently engage her to him especially when every Body else had abandon'd him he with an innocent Familiarity us'd to call her his  Nanny  This was taken in great Dudgeon and the spiteful Servants improv'd it into an Intrigue and never left till poor  Nanny  was turn'd away and with her all the old Man's Comfort for he had no warm Breakfast now if he was Sick there he might lie for no body would help him and as for Attendance they neglected him so much he was scarce clean which drew Tears from my Eyes as knowing what a neat old Man he was us'd to be And but for disgracing his Children he wish'd himself a thousand Times in the  CharterHouse  or some other Place of publick Charity I dissuaded him from such Thoughts and  comforted him in the best Manner I could and so we both parted and ended our pleasant Evening with heavy Hearts and wet Eyes  About a Week after by the  Pennypost  I receiv'd the following Letter  Dear Friend  THOUGH I shall carry to my Grave the agreeable Remembrance of ourlast Meeting I believe I shall suffer to my dying Day for that Night's Pleasure Your engaging Company and my long Abstinence from Wine made me I think drink a little too much and tho' not to disguise my self as you I hope might well perceive yet more than my Age and Weakness cou'd well bear My Daughter who seldom or never comes Home before Midnight took Care to be at Home that very Night before Nine aClock and at Ten she sent all the Family to Bed and sate up for me her self out of mere Spight and pure Intention to rattle me off which she did with a Vengeance crying out shame of such Hours telling me I was drunk and when I complain'd of sickness at my Stomach  she said it was good enough for me This you may conclude made me worse I thought I should have died and had not I eas'd my Stomach I had not surviv'd that Moment This put her beyond all Patience and instead of pitying her almost Dying Father she called me would you believe it she called me  Old Beast  and used me in such a Manner as has riv'd my very Heart Nor is this all for ever since I am become the Jest of the whole Family they call me  Old Fool  and  drunken old Beast  to my Face and every Visitor that comes in is told what a Sot I am so that I keep my Chamber and dare not show my Head about the House but I thank God who has heard my Prayers that I hourly find my self weaker and weaker and I doubt not but my long wished for Dissolution is near at hand for all the Torments of a lingering Death are Trifles to the Usage I meet with  Dear Friend  let me see you once more before I dye having some Manuscripts and a few other Trifles to give you in Remembrance of our old Friendship which alas is all I can give to the only Friend I have left on this side the Grave  Your Affectionate Friend  FOR the sake of the young Lady to whom God grant a speedy Repentance I forbear subscribing even the initial Letters of her Father's Name that the World may not know how good a Man she has murthered For her Usage was such that before I could find Opportunity to visit him according to his Desire I was prevented by a Ticket which invited me to hold up his Pall which more surpriz'd than afflicted me as knowing the miserable Life he lead under his most unnatural Daughter  Quis talia fando temperet a Lachrymis  The burying was of a Piece with the rest and I hope the whole will be a Warning to all aged Persons and teach 'em to reserve at least wherewithal to maintain themselves elsewhere in Case of the like Usage from their Children or Relations  I hope at the same time it will be a Looking Glass to young People especially those guilty of the like Actions If they see any thing ugly in this Lady's Character let them not be so over good natured to their own Persons as to think what is a Crime in her may be excusable in themselves No the Sin is the same let who will commit it  To do as we would be done by one would think a sufficient Restraint upon any who would give themselves the least time to consider that they in all probability may be Fathers and Mothers and that though they are young and healthy now they may be old and feeble hereafter Let them therefore use the Old as they could wish to be us'd when they are so and let them be as tender of their Parents as they wou'd have their Posterity tender of them  But on the contrary we bring up our Youth as it were to despise us and to our shame be it spoken make Rods for our selves Every one indulges his own Children and so all act with Impunity Our Youth are not half educated nor are they under any Restraint we make Men and Women of them too soon and put 'em upon a footing with our selves before they have well learned good Manners or indeed any thing else  For good Manners does not altogether consist in a formal Courtesy or Bow in coming in and going out of a Room No a Man may behave himself most punctually Ceremonious at a Ball a drawing Room a TeaTable or indeed in any other fiddle faddle part of Life and yet for all this be but a Man of Clouts a meer  SircourtlyNice  I have very often seen some of these  well dress'd well bred Gentlemen  alias  Hobbydehoy's have Assurance enough to stare a whole CoffeeRoom out of Countenance but neither Sense or Learning sufficient to give any Man of Parts a reasonable Answer  No the Satchel is too soon taken from the shoulders of our young sparks and the Rod from their Backsides the TyeWig and Sword are too soon put on and little Master is made a Man before he is a wellgrown Child our little Girls through the Indulgence of their Mothers are yet more forward and put on womanly Airs even at ten Years of Age In a Word our Youth in general are above Correction without Shame too ripe too ignorant and too impudent and according to the Poet  Now little Miss in HangingSleeves knows more  Than formerly her Grandame at threescore  And Master who was lately whipt at School  At bare thirteen sets up for Rake and Fool  Runs the whole Race of Vice with full Career  Is green and ripe and rotten in a Year  Instead of Puerile Diversions our Boys of or Years of Age go to Plays become Members of Clubs keep Hounds and Horses and sometimes follow worse Game This is owing to the over Indulgence of Parents who let them finger Money before they know the Worth of it and if a Stop be not put to such Practices in this Generation the next may severely repent it  Instead of Babies PlayThings and other pretty Innocencies used of old our Girls at or Years of Age keep their visiting Days have their select Companies and treat 'em with as much Solemnity and Expence as their Parents do their own Acquaintance This prevails not only at Court but in the City and I doubt not but the Court Airs of the Mother and the womanly Airs of the Daughter have made Bankrupt many an honest Man who had not Courage enough to repel the Force of this most prevailing most pernicious Custom  This idle Custom is not only very Expensive but extreamly inconvenient withal for there is as much a Fuss made at some Houses against such a Miss or such a Miss comes to visit the Daughter as if a Dutchess was expected The Servants are hindred from their other Business and the whole House is in a Fluster to receive  Miss's Visitors forsooth When the Visit is return'd she must be dress'd up to the heighth of the Mode and some new Thing or other is always wanted Not to mention TopKnots Gloves Coachhire and other unavoidable Expences  This is most criminal in those who cannot afford it Such People would therefore do well to reduce their Children to the Old Standard that is to say make Scholars of their Boys and Housewives of their Girls for the Education above complain'd of has spoil'd many a good Tradesman's Wife and been the Ruin of many a Family  I cannot close this Discourse without particularly cautioning the young Ladies of this Age how they Laugh Fleer and toss up their Noses at sober Matrons and elderly Ladies Let 'em consider that those very Persons were once young and beautiful as themselves if not more beautiful For to say truth Tea Drams Wine and late Hours have not a jot added to the Beauty of the present Generation  Let them again consider that their own Mothers as well as themselves are of the same Sex That it is a foul Bird bewrays its own Nest that the very Infirmities they deride in those Persons  are probably occasioned by the bearing and bringing up many Children and that the Wrinkles in their Faces are occasioned by their Care to support such giddy brain'd Creatures as themselves  But such is the Ignorance and Impudence of the present Generation that young People look upon their Elders as upon a different Species an inferiour Class of People They ascribe no Merit to the Virtue and Experience of Old Age but assume to themselves the Preference in all things With them a Face and a good Shape is Merit a scornful toss of the Head and despising every Body but their own dear selves is Wit an everlasting Giddiness and an eternal Grin is Affability and good Nature fancy in Dress is Understanding a supine Neglect of every thing commendable Gentility and a prodigious Punctilio in the greatest Trifles is the Heighth of good Breeding  From this general Corruption in Education proceeds all that may be complain'd of in this present Age and whatever Evils may be expected in Generations to come But above all nothing has more contributed to this Corruption than the disregard paid to Teachers and other Persons concern'd in the Education of Youth for the first and chief Step to the Ruin of  Youth is when they have no Awe upon 'em and are above Correction  Spare the Rod and spoil the Child  is a Sentence of so much Weight and Truth that no sharper a Reprimand can be given to those Parents who have stimulated in their Children a Spirit of Pride and taught them to look contemptibly on their Tutors The very Word  Master  or  Mistress  implies something of Dominion and as Youth are committed to their Care so they ought to be subject to their Discipline  It shocks me when I see a Tutor in a great Family put upon a Footing with the Servants it makes his Pupil think contemptibly of him and is too great a Curb on his Spirits to let him deliver his Instructions and Sentiments in a manner suitable to the Dignity of an Instructor And what is worse the little Deference paid to him begets in the young Gentleman a mean Opinion of and Indifference to Learning it self seeing his Master reap so little Advantage and Respect from it  It is the same Case in Schools where the Master's or Mistress's passive and sordid Temper makes them the Slaves of the Scholars whom they dare not correct for fear of loosing Nothing being more common now a days than for Parents to make it in their Bargain that their Children  shall not be whipt or otherwise corrected at School Hence proceeds all that Noise and Misrule which reigns in Schools stunning both Master and Scholars to such a Degree that they can hardly hear each other speak  Parents therefore can blame none but themselves if by these pernicious Methods their Children grow in time to be too many for them nor can they with any reason expect to find Duty and Humanity where they have not been inculcated If they have countenanc'd or indulg'd their Children in deriding the hoary Head are they to be pitied when they reap seven Fold the Fruits of so ungenerous a Tillage or to speak more plain when it comes Home to themselves Let every Person therefore make the Case their own when they see Children taunting and flouncing at their Parents Teachers or Relations mocking and deriding People for Age and Infirmities or indeed any other bodily Misfortune or Deformity upbraiding any for their Poverty or crowing over any Person over whom they may pretend to claim Preheminence This domineering way being now a days so prevalent that Tradesmen Servants and other Dependants are generally more insulted by Children than by Masters and Mistresses themselves  To conclude as we sow we shall reap As we bring up our Children so we may expect to find them If we educate them in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord in an universal Benevolence to all Mankind void of all personal or Party Prejudice if we train them up to be dutiful to their Parents respectful to their Teachers mannerly to their Equals and courteous to their Inferiours if we incite in 'em an Emulation and Thirst after Knowledge and other liberal Acquirements If we instil into 'em early Principles of Humanity Compassion and Forbearance and in a Word all that may inspire to the highest Notions of Honour and carry human Nature to its most exalted Pitch then may we expect to have Comfort in Old Age from our Grand Children our Children and other Relations then may we conclude we have laid a sure Foundation for the Happiness of succeeding Generations  But if on the contrary we humour and favour all their little Petulancies and by over praising and indulging them make our selves contemptible in their Eyes if instead of correcting them in their Errors we arraign the Justice of Discipline and call it Severity if we suffer them with Impunity to fly in the Faces of their Parents and Relations to defy their Teachers to  outvie their Equals and insult their Inferiours If we permit 'em to scoff at and turn to ridicule the Misfortunes and Afflictions of others and in a manner suppress or at least not encourage in them any Propensity to Tenderness but suffer their Hearts to be hardned and to know no Pity we must expect to have our Eyes pluck'd out by those we have brought up We must look for nothing in Old Age but Contempt Oppression and all the Insults we have but too much reason to fear from so inhuman a Generation  A PROJECT for erecting a PROTESTANTMONASTERY  _THAT a JointStock of Twenty Thousand Pounds be raised between Persons by an equal Deposite of four Hundred Pounds each which Stock is to be vested in themselves only For this being no Charity but rather a Copartnership there is no need of having any Governor Treasurer Director or other commanding Officer but what may be chosen among themselves and as the Money  is their own they are the fittest Persons to keep it  That after they have obtained his Majesty's Sanction and are become a Body Corporate under what Name or Title they shall think fit they may chuse from among themselves one Treasurer two Wardens and such other Officers they shall deem proper which Officers shall have annual Rotation and new ones be chosen every year  That instead of consuming all or a great Part of the Stock in Building which would nip the Project in the Bud they shall rent a convenient Hall or House in Town or Country at their own Option which House must be equally divided into Apartments and to save another great Expence as well as to prevent Partiality or Disgust 'tis fit that every Person furnish their own Apartment which Furniture they may bequeath to whom they please For as all the Members of the College are to be upon an equal Footing 'tis highly necessary there should not be the the least Distinction among them in Diet Lodging  c  And if one Person dresses or furnishes better than another there will be no need of Complaint because they do it at their own Charge Tho' to speak my Mind it would look most lovely  to have a decent Equality and Uniformity in Dress  The Kitchin the Infirmary and other Offices to be furnished at the common Expence but not to be taken out of the JointStock On the contrary every Person to pay an equal Proportion which cannot amount to above two Guineas a Head But in Case the JointStock encreases the Money to be refunded  That they call a Court among themselves as often as they shall think fit at which every Member shall have an equal Vote the Treasurer taking the Chair At these Courts every thing shall be settled all Bargains made all Accounts audited Servants hired or displac'd the Diet and College Hours settled and bye Laws made or amended as Occasion or the general Consent shall point out  As all are to share the Benefit it may readily be supposed that the best Advantage will be made of the Money but above all that they will go on a sure Footing and content themselves with the less Interest upon the greater Security Tho' I must confess I know of no safer and more profitable Method than to lend Money on proper Deposits as Goods Merchandises  c  after the Manner of the Charitable Corporation in  FenchurchStreet  This or some such sure Method may bring in twenty  per Cent  on their Money which will considerably encrease their Capital better their Provisions  c  and in time make them a very wealthy Body But in case no more than five  per Cent  Interest be produc'd from their Capital of twenty Thousand Pounds it will amount to one Thousand Pounds  per Annum  which may be laid out after this or the like Manner     l per An  To a Physician        To a Clerk for the Treasury        To a Chaplain        To a Cook        To a Laundry Maid        To a House Maid        To two Nurses for the Infirmary                 These Salaries may be enlarged as the College encreases in Wealth or the whole Subscription may be doubled at first and every thing in proportion But as this is only a Sketch or rough Draught farther Particulars from me would be needless  Besides I am but a poor Calculator and only give the Hint to the Publick as my Duty to my fellow Christians I wish for nothing more than to see it improved and if I don't properly explain my self People must be so charitable to think for me For I write even this under many bodily Infirmities and am so impatient to have done that I forget half I have to say But to proceed  The Salaries amounting to a Hundred Pounds a Year and allowing another Hundred for a House till there shall be Overplus enough to build one there remains just eight Hundred Pounds per  Annum  for Provision  If this should be deficient it will easily be made up out of the Overplus which will accrue    st  From making better Advantage of their Money than is here proposed    dly  From the Money paid at the Admission of new Members as the old ones dye And    dly  From the Legacies which the old Members may leave to augment the Stock for if but one Member die in a Year there is four Hundred Pounds to be added to the Thousand which will considerably augment every Article If more should dye or Legacies be left the Stock  will encrease and consequently the Interest thereof will make allowance for greater Expences and by degrees render the whole more Noble and Magnificent  Excuse gentle Reader my immethodical Manner of calculating and help me out the best you can for I have forgot some Things which ought to have been mentioned before but writing just as they occur I must leave the whole to be methodized and amended by a clearer Head and a more able Hand  I have mentioned Salaries without prescribing for what give me leave therefore to assign the Officers their proper Employments  The  Treasurer  must have care of the Cash and be Chairman of all Committees  The  Wardens  must look after the Provisions agree with all Tradesmen and superintend the Accounts  The  Physician  must visit twice a Week or oftner if need be and prescribe to the sick Members He may likewise appoint the Apothecary inspect his Medicines and tax his Bills  The  Clerk  or  Bookkeeper  must be constantly in the accompting House to set down every Particular to minute the proceeding of Committees to keep the account of Cash and in a word to take the  trouble of writing off the  Treasurer  and  Warden  's Hands he must diet in the House As also  The  Chaplain  some sober elderly decay'd Clergyman of good Morals to read Prayers Morning and Evening and every Sunday a Sermon out of Bishop  Tillotson  Dr  Scot  Dr  South  or some other sound Divine And to further this good Work I my self will present the College with a handsome Bible and Common Prayer Book and all the Sermons abovementioned if I live to see it finish'd and if I dye before I have made proper Provision in my Will  The  Cook  must dress the Victuals keep clean the Kitchin Pantry and Cellar  The  LaundryMaid  must wash and mend their Linnen and wait at Table  The  HouseMaid  must make the Beds sweep the

the Treasurer and Wardens shall appoint  As the Thing encreases so may the Servants and their Wages A Porter a Butler a Scullion and other Servants may be added as the Members think fit  To crown all let the whole be independent and among themselves let them always keep the Staff in their own Hands and never subject themselves to Treasurers  c  out of their own Body Let them accept of no Charities but do as many as they are able and in a Word let them keep up the Grandeur of the Design to such a Pitch that their Friends and Relations may not be ashamed to visit them but on the contrary be proud they are of such a Body Let the Election of new Members be vested only in themselves and let them chuse only such as shall give Reputation to the College  In a Word I have drawn up my Scheme in general Terms it being intended for the Benefit of either Sex 'Tis indifferent whether the Ladies compose a College and call themselves Sisters or any other Name they shall think fit or whether a College be compos'd of Gentlemen under the Title of Brothers Fellows or any other Denomination our  PROTESTANT MONASTERY  is still the same nor can a Name alter its Property or make it less beneficial
