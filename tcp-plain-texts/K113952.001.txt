 THE POETICAL CALENDAR VOL I FOR JANUARY  THE POETICAL CALENDAR  CONTAINING A COLLECTION Of scarce and valuable PIECES OF POETRYWith Variety of ORIGINALS AND TRANSLATIONS BY THE MOST EMINENT HANDS Intended as a Supplement to MR DODSLEY'S COLLECTION  Written and Selected By FRANCIS FAWKES MA And WILLIAM WOTY  IN TWELVE VOLUMES  LONDON Printed by DRYDEN LEACH For J COOTE at the King's Arms in PaternosterRow MDCCLXIII  ADVERTISEMENT  AS none of the liberal sciences can afford a nobler entertainment to the human mind than poetry so it is presumed that a judicious collection of agreeable and instructive poems can never be unseasonable Music ravishes the ear and affects the soul but its sweet enchantment is of short duration A fine piece of painting if carefully preserved will mellow into perfection and perhaps continue the admiration of mankind for some centuries but the works of THE POET live for ever We must however except those pieces which though intrinsically of the highest merit yet being published in a loose careless or inelegant manner must of course in a short time perish in the wreck of oblivion To preserve some of these spirited productions which have been thus unfortunately neglected is one part of the design of this publication But it will be proper briefly to inform the reader of the nature of our plan First then we propose once a month for one year only to publish a small volume of poems printed in an elegant manner each of which will take its title from the month at the conclusion of which it is published and be introduced with some original poems particularly descriptive of its proper  month afterwards will be added variety of pieces that are either amusing or instructive and at the same time not immoral which though of real merit have passed through the world unnoticed  Full many a flower is born to blush unseen  And waste its sweetness on the desert air  Though it must be confessed that our plan is of an extensive nature yet we do not in the least despair of bringing it to a considerable degree of perfection as we have laid in a very large fund of scarce and valuable poems are possessed of many original pieces and have the promise of assistance from gentlemen of the most celebrated names the most acknowledged taste and the most distinguished genius  FRANCIS FAWKES  WILLIAM WOTY  Dec  CONTENTS  ODE to January Page  Winter an ode

rough winds thunder loud  Aquarius sprinkles o'er  Of winter's hoary clime  The adamantine floor  He pours the Tyber and the Nile  To recompence the last year's spoil  'Tis he the twofac'd Janus comes in view  Wild hyacinths his robe adorn  And snowdrops rivals of the morn  He spurns the Goat aside  But smiles upon the new  Emerging year with pride  And now unlocks with agat key  The ruby gates of orient day  Mars and Bellona now suspend the war  Their red hoof'd steeds with battle worn  To their long vacant stalls return  In icy fetters bound  Beneath th' Antartic star  Seas burst their frozen mound  Far southern seas releas'd and free  Escape and rush to liberty  Thus let my soul beleaguer'd long with care  Find virtue's calm sequester'd seat  And trace the vestige of her feet  May each impassion'd thought  Meet a safe harbour there  Deem the low world as nought  And freed from folly's magic chain  To wisdom's lore return again  WINTER AN ODE  NO more the morn with tepid rays  Unfolds the flow'rs of various hue  Noon spreads no more the genial blaze  Nor gentle eve distils the dew  The lingering hours prolong the night  Usurping darkness shares the day  Her mists restrain the force of light  And Phoebus holds a doubtful sway  By gloomy twilight half reveal'd  With sighs we view the hoary hill  The leafless wood the naked field  The snowtopt cot the frozen rill  No music warbles thro' the grove  No vivid colours paint the plain  No more with devious steps I rove  Thro' verdant paths now sought in vain  Aloud the driving tempest roars  Congeal'd impetuous show'rs descend  Haste close the window bar the doors  Fate leaves me Stella and a friend  In nature's aid let art supply  With light and heat my little sphere  Rouse rouse the fire and pile it high  Light up a constellation here  Let music sound the voice of joy  Or mirth repeat the jocund tale  Let love his wanton wiles employ  And o'er the season wine prevail  Yet time life's dreary winter brings  When mirth's gay tale shall please no more  Nor music charm tho' Stella sings  Nor love nor wine the spring restore  Catch then O catch the transient hour  Improve each moment as it flies  Life's a short summer man a flow'r  He dies alas how soon he dies  WINTER A PASTORAL BALLAD  Felices ter amplius  Quos irrupta tenet copula  HOR  WHen the trees are all bare not a leaf to be seen  And the meadows their beauty have lost  When nature's disrob'd of her mantle of green  And the streams are fast bound with the frost  While the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold  As bleak the winds northerly blow  And the innocent flocks run for ease to the fold  With their fleeces besprinkled with snow  In the yard when the cattle are fodder'd with straw  And they send forth their breath like a steam  And the neat looking dairymaid sees she must thaw  Flakes of ice that she finds in the cream  When the sweet country maiden as fresh as a rose  As she carelesly trips often slides  And the rustics laugh loud if by falling she shows  All the charms that her modesty hides  When the lads and the lasses for company join'd  In a crowd round the embers are met  Talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind  And of ghosts till they're all in a sweat  Heav'n grant in this season it may be my lot  With the nymph whom I love and admire  While the icicles hang from the eves of my cot  I may thither in safety retire  Where in neatness and quiet and free from surprize  We may live and no hardships endure  Nor feel any turbulent passions arise  But such as each other may cure  A DESCRIPTION OF WINTER  BY MR AMBROSE PHILIPS TO THE EARL OF DORSET  Copenhagen  March  FRom frozen climes and endless tracks of snow  From streams which northern winds forbid to flow  What present shall the muse to Dorset bring  Or how so near the pole attempt to sing  All pleasing objects which to verse invite  The hoary winter here conceals from sight  The hills and dales and the delightful woods  The flowery plains and silverstreaming floods  By snow disguis'd in bright confusion lie  And with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye  No gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring  No birds within this desert region sing  The ships unmov'd the boisterous winds defy  While rattling chariots o'er the ocean fly  The vast Leviathan wants room to play  And spout his waters in the face of day  The starving wolves along the main sea prowl  And to the moon in icy valleys howl  O'er many a shining league the level main  Here spreads itself into a glassy plain  There solid billows of enormous size  Alps of green ice in wild disorder rise  And yet but lately have I seen ev'n here  The winter in a lovely dress appear  Ere yet the clouds let fall the treasur'd snow  Or winds began thro' hazy skies to blow  At evening a keen eastern breeze arose  And the descending rain unsully'd froze  Soon as the silent shades of night withdrew  The ruddy morn disclos'd at once to view  The face of nature in a rich disguise  And brighten'd every object to my eyes  For every shrub and every blade of grass  And every pointed thorn seem'd wrought in glass  In pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show  While thro' the ice the crimson berries glow  The thicksprung reeds which watery marshes yield  Seem'd polish'd lances in a hostile field  The stag in limpid currents with surprize  Sees crystal branches on his forehead rise  The spreading oak the beech and towering pine  Glaz'd over in the freezing aether shine  The frighted birds the rattling branches shun  Which wave and glitter in the distant sun  When if a sudden gust of wind arise  The brittle forest into atoms flies  The crackling wood beneath the tempest bends  And in a spangled show'r the prospect ends  Or if a southern gale the region warm  And by degrees unbind the wintery charm  The traveller a miry country sees  And journies sad beneath the dropping trees  Like some deluded peasant Merlin leads  Thro' fragrant bow'rs and thro' delicious meads  While here enchanted gardens to him rise  And airy fabrics there attract his eyes  His wandering feet the magic paths pursue  And while he thinks the fair illusion true  The trackless scenes disperse in fluid air  And woods and wilds and thorny ways appear  A tedious road the weary wretch returns  And as he goes the transient vision mourns  ON CAPTAIN FORRESTER'S TRAVELLING TO THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND IN WINTER ANNO INCOG  O'ER Caledonia's ruder Alps  While Forrester pursu'd his way  The mountains veil'd their rugged scalps  And wrapt in snow and wonder lay  Each sylvan god each rural power  Peep'd out to see the rareeshow  And all confess'd that till that hour  They ne'er had seen so bright a beau  Nay yet and more I dare advance  The story true as aught in print  All nature round in complaisance  And imitation took the hint  The fields that whilome only bore  Wild heath or clad at best with oats  Despis'd these humble weeds and wore  Rich spangled doublets and lac'd coats  The hills were perriwigg'd with snow  Pigtails of ice hung on each tree  The winds turn'd powderpuffs and lo  On every shrub a sharp toupee  With silver clocks the river gods  Appear'd and some will take their oath  Or lay at least a thousand odds  The clouds saliving spit white froth  The youth abash'd thus to survey  So rude a scene himself outdo  His sprightly genius to display  Resolv'd on something odd and new  All things he found were grown genteel  Which made him deem it apropo  To be alone in dishabile  A Forrester and not a beau  ON THE WINTER SOLSTICE  MDCCXL  BY DR AKENSIDE  THE radiant ruler of the year  At length his wint'ry goal attains  Soon to reverse the long career  And northward bend his golden reins  Prone on Potosi's haughty brow  His fiery streams incessant flow  Ripening the silver's ductile stores  While in the cavern's horrid shade  The panting Indian hides his head  And oft th' approach of eve explores  But lo on this deserted coast  How faint the light how thick the air  Lo arm'd with whirlwind hail and frost  Fierce winter desolates the year  The fields resign their chearful bloom  No more the breezes waft perfume  No more the warbling waters roll  Deserts of snow fatigue the eye  Black storms involve the louring sky  And gloomy damps oppress the soul  Now thro' the town promiscuous throngs  Urge the warm bowl and ruddy fire  Harmonious dances festive songs  To charm the midnight hours conspire  While mute and shrinking with her fears  Each blast the cottagematron hears  As o'er the hearth she sits alone  At morn her bridegroom went abroad  The night is dark and deep the road  She sighs and wishes him at home  But thou my lyre awake arise  And hail the sun's remotest ray  Now now he climbs the northern skies  Tomorrow nearer than today  Then louder howl the stormy waste  Be land and ocean worse defac'd  Yet brighter hours are on the wing  And fancy thro' the wintry glooms  All fresh with dews and opening blooms  Already hails th' emerging spring  O fountain of the golden day  Could mortal vows but urge thy speed  How soon before thy vernal ray  Should each unkindly damp recede  How soon each hovering tempest fly  That now fermenting loads the sky  Prompt on our heads to burst amain  To rend the forest from the steep  Or thundering o'er the Baltic deep  To whelm the merchant's hopes of gain  But let not man's unequal views  Presume on nature and her laws  'Tis his with grateful joy to use  Th' indulgence of the sovereign cause  Secure that health and beauty springs  Thro' this majestic frame of things  Beyond what he can reach to know  And that heav'n's allsubduing will  With good the progeny of ill  Attempers every state below  How pleasing wears the wint'ry night  Spent with the old illustrious dead  While by the taper's trembling light  I seem those awful courts to tread  Where chiefs and legislators lie  Whose triumphs move before my eye  With every laurel fresh display'd  While charm'd I taste th' Ionian song  Or bend to Plato's godlike tongue  Resounding thro' the olive shade  But if the gay wellnatur'd friend  Bids leave the studious page awhile  Then easier joys the soul unbend  And teach the brow a softer smile  Then while the genial glass is paid  By each to her that fairest maid  Whose radiant eyes his hopes obey  What lucky vows his bosom warm  While absence heightens every charm  And love invokes returning May  May thou delight of heav'n and earth  When will thy happy morn arise  When the dear place which gave her birth  Restore Lucinda to my eyes  There while she walks the wonted grove  The seat of music and of love  Bright as the one primaeval fair  Thither ye silversounding lyres  Thither gay smiles and young desires  Chaste hope and mutual faith repair  And if believing love can read  The wonted softness in her eye  Then shall my fears O charming maid  And every pain of absence die  Then ofter to thy name attun'd  And rising to diviner sound  I'll wake the free Horatian song  Old Tyne shall listen to my tale  And echo down the bordering vale  The liquid melody prolong  THE WINTER'S WALK  BEhold my fair wheree'er we rove  What dreary prospects round us rise  The naked hills the leafless grove  The hoary ground the frowning skies  Nor only through the wasted plain  Stern winter is thy force confest  Still wider spreads thy horrid reign  I feel thy power usurp my breast  Enlivening hope and fond desire  Resign the heart to spleen and care  Scarce frighted love maintains her fire  And rapture saddens to despair  In groundless hope and causeless fear  Unhappy man behold thy doom  Still changing with the changeful year  The slave of sunshine and of gloom  Tir'd with vain joys and false alarms  With mental and corporeal strife  Snatch me my Stella to thy arms  And screen me from the ills of life  TO THE AUTHOR OF THE SPECTATOR  BY THOMAS TICKELL ESQUIRE  IN courts licentious and a shameless stage  How long the war shall wit with virtue wage  Inchanted by this prostituted fair  Our youth run headlong in the fatal snare  In height of rapture clasp unheeded pains  And suck pollution thro' their tingling veins  Thy spotless thoughts unshock'd the priest may hear  And the pure vestal in her bosom wear  To conscious blushes and diminish'd pride  Thy glass betrays what treacherous love would hide  Nor harsh thy precepts but infus'd by stealth  Please while they cure and cheat us into health  Thy works in Chloe's toilet gain a part  And with his taylor share the fopling's heart  Lash'd in thy satire the penurious cit  Laughs at himself and finds no harm in wit  From felon gamesters the raw 'squire is free  And Britain owes her rescu'd oaks to thee  His miss the frolic viscount dreads to toast  Or his third cure the shallow templar boast  And the rash fool who scorn'd the beaten road  Dares quake at thunder and confess his God  The brainless stripling who expell'd the town  Damn'd the stiff college and pedantic gown  Aw'd by thy name is dumb and thrice a week  Spells uncouth Latin and pretends to Greek  A sauntring tribe such born to wide estates  With yea and no in senates hold debates  At length despis'd each to his fields retires  First with the dogs and king amidst the 'squires  From pert to stupid sinks supinely down  In youth a coxcomb and in age a clown  Such readers scorn'd thou wing'st thy daring flight  Above the stars and tread'st the fields of light  Fame heav'n and hell are thy exalted theme  And visions such as Jove himself might dream  Man sunk to slavery tho' to glory born  Heav'n's pride when upright and deprav'd his scorn  Such hints alone could British Virgil lend  And thou alone deserve from such a friend  A debt so borrow'd is illustrious shame  And fame when shar'd with him is double fame  So flush'd with sweets by beauty's queen bestow'd  With more than mortal charms Aeneas glow'd  Such generous strife Eugene and Malbro' try  And as in glory so in friendship vie  Permit these lines by thee to livenor blame  A muse that pants and languishes for fame  That fears to sink when humbler themes she sings  Lost in the mass of mean forgotten things  Receiv'd by thee I prophesy my rhimes  The praise of virgins in succeeding times  Mixt with thy works their life no bounds shall see  But stand protected as inspir'd by thee  So some weak shoot which else would poorly rise  Jove's tree adopts and lifts him to the skies  Thro' the new pupil fostering juices flow  Thrust forth the gems and give the flowers to blow  Aloft immortal reigns the plant unknown  With borrow'd life and vigour not his own  TO MR ADDISON ON HIS OPERA OF ROSAMOND  BY THE SAME  Ne forte pudori  Sit tibi musa lyrae solers cantor Apollo  THE opera first Italian masters taught  Enrich'd with songs but innocent of thought  Britannia's learned theatre disdains  Melodious trifles and enervate strains  And blushes on her injur'd stage to see  Nonsense welltun'd and sweet stupidity  No charms are wanting to thy artful song  Soft as Corelli and as Virgil strong  From words so sweet new grace the notes receive  And music borrows helps she us'd to give  Thy style has match'd what antient Romans knew  Thy flowing numbers far excel the new  Their cadence in such easy sound convey'd  That height of thought may seem superfluous aid  Yet in such charms the noble thoughts abound  That needless seem the sweets of easy sound  Landscapes how gay the bowery grotto yields  Which thought creates and lavish fancy builds  What art can trace the visionary scenes  The flowery groves and everlasting greens  The babling sounds that mimic echo plays  The fairy shade and its eternal maze  Nature and art in all their charms combin'd  And all Elysium to one view combin'd  No farther could imagination roam  Till Vanbrugh fram'd and Marlbro' rais'd the dome  Ten thousand pangs my anxious bosom tear  When drown'd in tears I see th' imploring fair  When bards less soft the moving words supply  A seeming justice dooms the nymph to die  But here she begs nor can she beg in vain  In dirges thus expiring swans complain  Each verse so swells expressive of her woes  And every tear in lines so mournful flows  We spite of fame her fate revers'd believe  O'erlook her crimes and think she ought to live  Let joy salute fair Rosamonda's shade  And wreaths of myrtle crown the lovely maid  While now perhaps with Dido's ghost she roves  And hears and tells the story of their loves  Alike they mourn alike they bless their fate  Since love which made 'em wretched makes 'em great  Nor longer that relentless doom bemoan  Which gain'd a Virgil and an Addison  Accept great monarch of the British lays  The tribute song an humble subject pays  So tries the artless lark her early flight  And soars to hail the god of verse and light  Unrival'd as unmatch'd be still thy fame  And thy own laurels shade thy envy'd name  Thy name the boast of all the tuneful quire  Shall tremble on the strings of every lyre  Who reads thy work shall own the sweet surprize  And view thy Rosamond with Henry's eyes  TO MR ADDISON ON HIS TRAGEDY OF CATO  BY THE SAME  TOO long has love engross'd Britannia's stage  And sunk to softness all our tragic rage  By that alone did empires fall or rise  And fate depended on a fair one's eyes  The sweet infection mixt with dangerous art  Debas'd our manhood while it sooth'd the heart  Thou scorn'st to raise a grief thyself must blame  Nor from our weakness steal a vulgar fame  A patriot's fall may justly melt the mind  And tears flow nobly shed for all mankind  How do our souls with generous pleasure glow  Our hearts exulting while our eyes o'erflow  When thy firm hero stands beneath the weight  Of all his sufferings venerably great  Rome's poor remains still sheltering by his side  With conscious virtue and becoming pride  The aged oak thus rears his head in air  His sap exhausted and his branches bare  'Midst storms and earthquakes he maintains his state  Fixt deep in earth and fasten'd by his weight  His naked boughs still lend the shepherds aid  And his old trunk projects an awful shade  Amidst the joys triumphant peace bestows  Our patiots sadden at his glorious woes  A while they let the world's great business wait  Anxious for Rome and sigh for Cato's fate  Here taught how antient heroes rose to fame  Our Britons crowd and catch the Roman flame  Where states and senates well might lend an ear  And kings and priests without a blush appear  France boasts no more but fearful to engage  Now first pays homage to her rival's stage  Hastes to learn thee and learning shall submit  Alike to British arms and British wit  No more she'll wonder forc'd to do us right  Who think like Romans could like Romans fight  Thy Oxford smiles this glorious work to see  And fondly triumphs in a son like thee  The senates consuls and the gods of Rome  Like old acquaintance at their native home  In thee we find each deed each word exprest  And every thought that swell'd a Roman breast  We trace each hint that could thy soul inspire  With Virgil's judgment and with Lucan's fire  We know thy worth and give us leave to boast  We most admire because we know thee most  THE ROYAL PROGRESS  BY THE SAME  WHen Brunswick first appear'd each honest heart  Intent on verse disdain'd the rules of art  For him the songsters in unmeasur'd odes  Debas'd Alcides and dethron'd the gods  In golden chains the kings of India led  Or rent the turban from the sultan's head  One in old fables and the pagan strain  With nymphs and tritons wafts him o'er the main  Another draws fierce Lucifer in arms  And fills th' infernal region with alarms  A third awakes some druid to foretell  Each future triumph from his dreary cell  Exploded fancies that in vain deceive  While the mind nauseates what she can't believe  My muse th' expected hero shall pursue  From clime to clime and keep him still in view  His shining march describe in faithful lays  Content to paint him nor presume to praise  Their charms if charms they have the truth supplies  And from the theme unlabour'd beauties rise  By longing nations for the throne design'd  And call'd to guard the rights of humankind  With secret grief his godlike soul repines  And Britain's crown with joyless lustre shines  While prayers and tears his destin'd progress stay  And crowds of mourners choak their sovereign's way  Not so he march'd when hostile squadrons stood  In scenes of death and fir'd his generous blood  When his hot courser paw'd th' Hungarian plain  And adverse legions stood the shock in vain  His frontiers past the Belgian bounds he views  And cross the level fields his march pursues  Here pleas'd the land of freedom to survey  He greatly scorns the thirst of boundless sway  O'er the thin soil with silent joy he spies  Transplanted woods and borrow'd verdure rise  Where every meadow won with toil and blood  From haughty tyrants and the raging flood  With fruits and flowers the careful hind supplies  And cloaths the marshes in a rich disguise  Such wealth for frugal hands doth heaven decree  And such thy gifts celestial liberty  Thro' stately towns and many a fertile plain  The pomp advances to the neighbouring main  Whole nations croud around with joyful cries  And view the hero with insatiate eyes  In Haga's towers he waits till eastern gales  Propitious rise to swell the British sails  Hither the fame of England's monarch brings  The vows and friendships of the neighb'ring kings  Mature in wisdom his extensive mind  Takes in the blended interests of mankind  The world's great patriot Calm thy anxious breast  Secure in him O Europe take thy rest  Henceforth thy kingdoms shall remain confin'd  By rocks or streams the mounds which heav'n design'd  The Alps their newmade monarch shall restrain  Nor shall thy hills Pirene rise in vain  But see to Britain's isle the squadrons stand  And leave the sinking towers and lessening land  The royal bark bounds o'er the floating plain  Breaks thro' the billows and divides the main  O'er the vast deep great monarch dart thine eyes  A watery prospect bounded by the skies  Ten thousand vessels from ten thousand shores  Bring gums and gold and either India's stores  Behold the tributes hastening to thy throne  And see the wide horizon all thy own  Still is it thine tho' now the chearful crew  Hail Albion's cliffs just whitening to the view  Before the wind with swelling sails they ride  Till Thames receives them in his opening tide  The monarch hears the thundering peals around  From trembling woods and echoing hills rebound  Nor misses yet amid the deafening train  The roarings of the hoarse resounding main  As in the flood he sails from either side  He views his kingdom in its rural pride  A various scene the wide spread landscape yields  O'er rich enclosures and luxuriant fields  A lowing herd each fertile pasture fills  And distant flocks stray o'er a thousand hills  Fair Greenwich hid in woods with new delight  Shade above shade now rises to the sight  His woods ordain'd to visit every shore  And guard the island which they grac'd before  The sun now rolling down the western way  A blaze of fires renews the fading day  Unnumber'd barks the regal barge infold  Brightening the twilight with its beamy gold  Less thick the finny shoals a countless fry  Before the whale or kingly dolphin fly  In one vast shout he seeks the crouded strand  And in a peal of thunder gains the land  Welcome great stranger to our longing eyes  Oh king desir'd adopted Albion cries  For thee the east breath'd out a prosperous breeze  Bright were the suns and gently swell'd the seas  Thy presence did each doubtful heart compose  And factions wonder'd that they once were foes  That joyful day they lost each hostile name  The same their aspect and their voice the same  So two fair twins whose features were design'd  At one soft moment in the mother's mind  Show each the other with reflected grace  And the same beauties bloom in either face  The puzzled strangers which is which enquire  Delusion grateful to the smiling sire  From that fair  Mr Flamstead's house  hill where hoary sages boast  To name the stars and count the heavenly host  By the next dawn doth great Augusta rise  Proud town the noblest scene beneath the skies  O'er Thames her thousand spires their lustre shed  And a vast navy hides his ample bed  A floating forest From the distant strand  A line of golden carrs strikes o'er the land  Britannia's peers in pomp and rich array  Before their king triumphant lead the way  Far as the eye can reach the gaudy train  A bright procession shines along the plain  So haply through the heaven's wide pathless ways  A comet draws a long extended blaze  From east to west burns through th' ethereal frame  And half heaven's convex glitters with the flame  Now to the regal towers securely brought  He plans Britannia's glories in his thought  Resumes the delegated power he gave  Rewards the faithful and restores the brave  Whom shall the muse from out the shining throng  Select to heighten and adorn her song  Thee Hallifax To thy capacious mind  O man approv'd is Britain's wealth consign'd  Her coin while Nassau fought debas'd and rude  By thee in beauty and in truth renew'd  An arduous work again thy charge we see  And thy own care once more returns to thee  O form'd in every scene to awe and please  Mix wit with pomp and dignity with ease  Tho' call'd to shine aloft thou wilt not scorn  To smile on arts thyself did once adorn  For this thy name succeeding time shall praise  And envy less thy garter than thy bays  The muse if fir'd with thy enlivening beams  Perhaps shall aim at more exalted themes  Record our monarch in a nobler strain  And sing the opening wonders of his reign  Bright Carolina's heavenly beauties trace  Her valiant consort and his blooming race  A train of kings their fruitful love supplies  A glorious scene to Albion's ravish'd eyes  Who sees by Brunswick's hand her scepter sway'd  And through his line from age to age convey'd  AN ODE OCCASIONED BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE EARL OF STANHOPE'S VOYAGE TO FRANCE  BY THE SAME  FAIR daughter once of Windsor's woods  In safety o'er the rowling floods  Britannia's boast and darling care  Big with the fate of Europe bear  May winds propitious on his way  The minister of peace convey  Nor rebel wave nor rising storm  Great George's liquid realms deform  Our vows are heard Thy crowded sails  Already swell with western gales  Already Albion's coast retires  And Calais multiplies her spires  At length has royal Orleans prest  With open arms the wellknown guest  Before in sacred friendship join'd  And now in counsels for mankind  Whilst his clear schemes our patriot shows  And plans the threaten'd world's repose  They fix each haughty monarch's doom  And bless whole ages yet to come  Henceforth great Brunswick shall decree  What flag must awe the Tyrrhene sea  For whom the Tuscan grape shall glow  And fruitful Arethusa flow  See in firm league with Thames combine  The Seine the Maese and distant Rhine  Nor Ebro let thy single rage  With half the warring world engage  Oh call to mind thy thousands slain  And Almanara's fatal plain  While yet the Gallic terrors sleep  Nor Britain thunders from the deep  PROLOGUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD  BY THE SAME  WHat kings henceforth shall reign what states be free  Is fix'd at length by Anna's just decree  Whose brows the muse's sacred wreath shall fit  Is left to you the arbiters of wit  With beating hearts the rival poets wait  Till you Athenians shall decide their fate  Secure when to these learned seats they come  Of equal judgment and impartial doom  Poor is the player's fame whose whole renown  Is but the praise of a capricious town  While with mockmajesty and fancied power  He struts in robes the monarch of an hour  Oft wide of nature must he act a part  Make love in tropes in bombast break his heart  In turn and simile resign his breath  And rhyme and quibble in the pangs of death  We blush when plays like these receive applause  And laugh in secret at the tears we cause  With honest scorn our own success disdain  A worthless honour and inglorious gain  No trifling scenes at Oxford shall appear  Well what we blush to act may you to hear  To you our fam'd our standard plays we bring  The work of poets whom you taught to sing  Tho' crown'd with fame they dare not think it due  Nor take the laurel till bestow'd by you  Great Cato's self the glory of the stage  Who charms corrects exalts and fires the age  Begs here he may be tried by Roman laws  To you O fathers he submits his cause  He rests not in the people's general voice  Till you the senate have confirm'd his choice  Fine is the secret delicate the art  To wind the passions and command the heart  For fancied ills to force our tears to flow  And make the generous soul in love with woe  To raise the shades of heroes to our view  Rebuild fallen empires and old time renew  How hard the task how rare the godlike rage  None should presume to dictate for the stage  But such as boast a great extensive mind  Enrich'd by nature and by art refin'd  Who from the antient stores their knowledge bring  And tasted early of the muse's spring  May none pretend upon her throne to sit  But such as sprung from you are born to wit  Chose by the mob their lawless claim we slight  Your's is the old hereditary right  THOUGHTS OCCASIONED BY THE SIGHT OF AN ORIGINAL PICTURE OF KING CHARLES I TAKEN AT THE TIME OF HIS TRIAL  INSCRIBED TO GEORGE CLARKE ESQ  BY THE SAME  CAN this be he could Charles the good the great  Be sunk by heaven to such a dismal state  How meagre pale neglected worn with care  What steady sadness and august despair  In those sunk eyes the grief of years I trace  And sorrow seems acquainted with that face  Tears which his heart disdain'd from me o'erflow  Thus to survey God's substitute below  In solemn anguish and majestic woe  When spoil'd of empire by unhallow'd hands  Sold by his slaves and held in impious bands  Rent from what oft had sweeten'd anxious life  His helpless children and his bosom wife  Doom'd for the faith plebeian rage to stand  And fall a victim for the guilty land  Then thus was seen abandon'd and forlorn  The king the father and the saint to mourn  How could'st thou artist then thy skill display  Thy steady hands thy savage heart betray  Near thy bold work the stun'd spectators faint  Nor see unmov'd what thou unmov'd could'st paint  What brings to mind each various scene of woe  Th' insulting judge the solemnmocking show  The horrid sentence and accursed blow  Where then just heaven was thy unactive hand  Thy idle thunder and thy lingering brand  Thy adamantine shield thy angel wings  And the great genii of anointed kings  Treason and fraud shall thus the stars regard  And injur'd virtue meet this sad reward  So sad none like can time's old records tell  Though Pompey bled and poor Darius fell  All names but one too lowthat one too high  All parallels are wrongs or blasphemy  O power supreme how secret are thy ways  Yet man vain man would trace the mystic maze  With foolish wisdom arguing charge his God  His ballance hold and guide his angry rod  Newmould the spheres and mend the sky's design  And sound th' immense with his short scanty line  Do thou my soul the destin'd period wait  When God shall solve the dark decrees of fate  His now unequal dispensations clear  And make all wise and beautiful appear  When suffering saints aloft in beams shall glow  And prosperous traitors gnash their teeth below  Such boding thoughts did guilty conscience dart  A pledge of hell to dying Cromwell's heart  Then this pale image seem'd t' invade his room  Gaz'd him to stone and warn'd him to the tomb  While thunders roll and nimble lightnings play  And the storm wings his spotted soul away  A blast more bounteous ne'er did heaven command  To scatter blessings o'er the British land  Not that more kind which dash'd the pride of Spain  And whirl'd her crush'd Armada round the main  Not those more kind which guide our floating towers  Waft gums and gold and made far India ours  That only kinder which to Britain's shore  Did mitres crowns and Stuart's race restore  Renew'd the church revers'd the kingdom's doom  And brought with Charles an Anna yet to come  O Clarke to whom a Stuart trusts her reign  O'er Albion's fleets and delegates the main  Dear as the faith thy loyal heart hath sworn  Transmit this piece to ages yet unborn  This sight shall damp the raging russian's breast  The poison spill and halfdrawn sword arrest  To soft compassion stubborn traitors bend  And one destroy'd a thousand kings defend  TO APOLLO MAKING LOVE  FROM MONSIEUR FONTENELLE  BY THE SAME  I Am cried Apollo when Daphne he woo'd  And panting for breath the coy virgin pursu'd  When his wisdom in manner most ample exprest  The long list of the graces his godship possest  I'm the god of sweet song and inspirer of lays  Nor for lays nor sweet song the fair fugitive stays  I'm the god of the harpstop my fairestin vain  Nor the harp nor the harper could fetch her again  Every plant every flower and their virtues I know  God of light I'm above and of physic below  At the dreadful word physic the nymph fled more fast  At the fatal word physic she doubled her haste  Thou fond god of wisdom then alter thy phrase  Bid her view thy young bloom and thy ravishing rays  Tell her less of thy knowledge and more of thy charms  And my life for't the damsel shall fly to thy arms  THE FATAL CURIOSITY  BY THE SAME  MUch had I heard of fair Francelia's name  The lavish praises of the babler fame  I thought them such and went prepar'd to pry  And trace the charmer with a critic's eye  Resolv'd to find some fault before unspy'd  And disappointed if but satisfy'd  Love pierc'd the vassal heart that durst rebel  And where a judge was meant a victim fell  On those dear eyes with sweet perdition gay  I gaz'd at once my pride and soul away  All o'er I felt the luscious poison run  And in a look the hasty conquest won  Thus the fond moth around the taper plays  And sports and flutters near the treacherous blaze  Ravish'd with joy he wings his eager flight  Nor dreams of ruin in so clear a light  He tempts his fate and courts a glorious doom  A bright destruction and a shining tomb  TO A LADY WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOENIX  BY THE SAME  LAvish of wit and bold appear the lines  Where Claudian's genius in the Phoenix shines  A thousand ways each brilliant point is turn'd  And the gay poem like its theme adorn'd  A tale more strange ne'er grac'd the poets art  Nor e'er did fiction play so wild a part  Each fabled charm in matchless Caelia meets  The heavenly colours and ambrosial sweets  Her virgin bosom chaster fires supplies  And beams more piercing guard her kindred eyes  O'erflowing wit th' imagin'd wonder drew  But fertile fancy ne'er can reach the true  Now buds your youth your cheeks their bloom disclose  Th' untainted lilly and unfolding rose  Ease in your mein and sweetness in your face  You speak a syren and you move a grace  Nor time shall urge these beauties to decay  While virtue gives what years shall steal away  The fair whose youth can boast the worth of age  In age shall with the charms of youth engage  In every change still lovely still the same  A fairer Phoenix in a purer flame  A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOENIX  FROM CLAUDIAN  BY THE SAME  IN utmost Ocean lies a lovely isle  Where spring still blooms and greens for ever smile  Which sees the sun put on his first array  And hears his panting steeds bring on the day  When from the deep they rush with rapid force  And whirl aloft to run their glorious course  When first appear the ruddy streaks of light  And glimmering beams dispel the parting night  In these soft shades unprest by human feet  The happy Phoenix keeps his balmy seat  Far from the world disjoin'd he reigns alone  Alike the empire and its king unknown  A godlike bird whose endless round of years  Outlasts the stars and tires the circling spheres  Not us'd like vulgar birds to eat his fill  Or drink the chrystal of the murm'ring rill  But fed by warmth from Titan's purer ray  And slak'd by streams which eastern seas convey  Still he renews his life in these abodes  Contemns the power of fate and mates the gods  His fiery eyes shoot forth a glittering ray  And round his head ten thousand glories play  High on his crest a star celestial bright  Divides the darkness with its piercing light  His legs are stain'd with purple's lively dye  His azure wings the fleeting winds outfly  Soft plumes of chearful blue his limbs infold  Enrich'd with spangles and bedropt with gold  Begot by none himself begetting none  Sire of himself he is and of himself the son  His life in fruitful death renews its date  And kind destruction but prolongs his fate  Ev'n in the grave new strength his limbs receive  And on the funeral pile begin to live  For when a thousand times the summer sun  His bending race has on the zodiac run  And when as oft the vernal signs have roll'd  As oft the wintery brought the numbing cold  Then drops the bird worn out with aged cares  And bends beneath the mighty load of years  So falls the stately pine that proudly grew  The shade and glory of the mountain's brow  When pierc'd by blasts and spouting clouds o'erspread  It slowly sinking nods its tottering head  Part dies by winds and part by sickly rains  And wasting age destroys the poor remains  Then as the silver empress of the night  O'erclouded glimmers in a fainter light  So froze with age and shut from light's supplies  In lazy rounds scarce roll his feeble eyes  And those fleet wings for strength and speed renown'd  Scarce rear th' unactive lumber from the ground  Mysterious arts a second time create  The bird prophetic of approaching fate  Pil'd on an heap Sabaean herbs he lays  Parch'd by his sire the sun's intensest rays  The pile design'd to form his funeral scene  He wraps in covers of a fragrant green  And bids the spicy heap at once become  A grave destructive and a teeming womb  On the rich bed the dying wonder lies  Imploring Phoebus with persuasive cries  To dart upon him in collected rays  And newcreate him in a deadly blaze  The god beholds the suppliant from afar  And stops the progress of his heavenly car  " O thou says he whom harmless fires shall burn  " Thy age the flame to second youth shall turn  " An infant's cradle is thy funeral urn  " Thou on whom heav'n has fix'd th' ambiguous doom  " To live by ruin and by death to bloom  " Thy life thy strength thy lovely form renew  " And with fresh beauties doubly charm the view  Thus speaking midst the aromatic bed  A golden beam he tosses from his head  Swift as desire the shining ruin flies  And strait devours the willing sacrifice  Who hastes to perish in the fertile fire  Sink into strength and into life expire  In flames the circling odours mount on high  Perfume the air and glitter in the sky  The moon and stars amaz'd retard their flight  And nature startles at the doubtful sight  For whilst the pregnant urn with fury glows  The goddess labours with a mother's throes  Yet joys to cherish in the friendly flames  The noblest product of the skill she claims  Th' enlivening dust its head begins to rear  And on the ashes sprouting plumes appear  In the dead bird reviving vigour reigns  And life returning revels in his veins  A newborn Phoenix starting from the flame  Obtains at once a son's and father's name  And the great change of double life displays  In the short moment of one transient blaze  On his new pinions to the Nile he bends  And to the gods his parent urn commends  To Egypt bearing with majestic pride  The balmy nest where first he liv'd and dy'd  Birds of all kinds admire th' unusual sight  And grace the triumph of his infant flight  In crowds unnumber'd round their chief they fly  Oppress the air and cloud the spacious sky  Nor dares the fiercest of the winged race  Obstruct his journey thro' th' etherial space  The hawk and eagle useless wars forbear  Forego their courage and consent to fear  The feather'd nations humble homage bring  And bless the gaudy flight of their ambrosial king  Less glittering pomp does Parthia's monarch yield  Commanding legions to the dusty field  Tho' sparkling jewels on his helm abound  And royal gold his awful head surround  Tho' rich embroidery paint his purple vest  And his steed bound in costly trappings drest  Pleas'd in the battle's dreadful van to ride  In graceful grandeur and imperial pride  Fam'd for the worship of the sun there stands  A sacred fane in Egypt's fruitful lands  Hewn from the Theban mountain's rocky womb  An hundred columns rear the marble dome  Hither 'tis said he brings the precious load  A grateful offering to the beamy god  Upon whose altar's consecrated blaze  The seeds and reliques of himself he lays  Whence flaming incense makes the temple shine  And the glad altars breathe perfumes divine  The wafted smell to far Pelusium flies  To chear old Ocean and enrich the skies  With nectar's sweets to make the nations smile  And scent the sevenfold channels of the Nile  Thrice happy Phoenix heaven's peculiar care  Has made thy self thy self's surviving heir  By death thy deathless vigour is supply'd  Which sinks to ruin all the world beside  Thy age not thee assisting Phoebus burns  And vital flames light up thy funeral urns  Whate'er events have been thy eyes survey  And thou art fixt while ages roll away  Thou saw'st when raging Ocean burst his bed  O'ertop'd the mountains and the earth o'erspread  When the rash youth inflam'd the high abodes  Scorch'd up the skies and scar'd the deathless gods  When nature ceases thou shalt still remain  Nor second chaos bound thy endless reign  Fate's tyrant laws thy happier lot shall brave  Baffle destruction and elude the grave  VERSES TO MRS LOWTHER ON HER MARRIAGE FROM MENAGE  BY THE SAME  THE greatest swain that treads th' Arcadian grove  Our shepherds envy and our virgins love  His charming nymph his softer fair obtains  The bright Diana of our flowery plains  He midst the graceful of superior grace  And she the loveliest of the loveliest race  Thy fruitful influence guardian Juno shed  And crown the pleasures of the genial bed  Raise thence their future joy a smiling heir  Brave as the father as the mother fair  Well may'st thou shower thy choicest gifts on those  Who boldly rival thy most hated foes  The vig'rous bridegroom with Alcides vies  And the fair bride has Cytherea's eyes  TO A LADY WITH A PRESENT OF FLOWERS  BY THE SAME  Each beauteous flowerroses and jessamin  Rear'd high their flourish'd heads  MILTON  THE fragrant painting of our flowery fields  The choicest stores that youthful summer yields  Strephon to fair Elisa hath convey'd  The sweetest garland to the sweetest maid  O cheer the flowers my fair and let them rest  On the Elysium of thy snowy breast  And there regale the smell and charm the view  With richer odours and a lovelier hue  Learn hence nor fear a flatterer in the flower  Thy form divine and beauty's matchless power  Faint near thy cheeks the bright carnation glows  And thy ripe lips outblush the opening rose  The lily's snow betrays less pure a light  Lost in thy bosom's more unsullied white  And wreaths of jasmine shed perfumes beneath  Th' ambrosial incense of thy balmy breath  Ten thousand beauties grace the rival pair  How fair the chaplet and the nymph how fair  But ah too soon these fleeting charms decay  The fading lustre of one hastening day  This night shall see the gaudy wreath decline  The roses wither and the lilies pine  The garland's fate to thine shall be applied  And what advanc'd thy form shall check thy pride  Be wise my fair the present hour improve  Let joy be new and now a waste of love  Each drooping bloom shall plead thy just excuse  And that which show'd thy beauty show its use  ON A LADY'S PICTURE  TO GILFRED LAWSON ESQ  BY THE SAME  AS Damon Chloe's painted form survey'd  He sigh'd and languish'd for the jilting shade  For Cupid taught the artist hand its grace  And Venus wanton'd in the mimic face  Now he laments a look so falsly fair  And almost damns what yet resembles her  Now he devours it with his longing eyes  Now sated from the lovely phantom flies  Yet burns to look again yet looks again and dies  Her ivory neck his lips presume to kiss  And his bold hands the swelling bosom press  The swain drinks in deep draughts of vain desire  Melts without heat and burns in fancied fire  Strange power of paint thou nice creator art  What love inspires may life itself impart  Struck with like wounds of old Pygmalion pray'd  And hugg'd to life his artificial maid  Clasp new Pygmalion clasp the seeming charms  Perhaps even now th' enlivening image warms  Destin'd to crown thy joys and revel in thy arms  Thy arms which shall with fire so fierce invade  That she at once shall be and cease to be a maid  PART OF THE FOURTH BOOK OF LUCAN  BY THE SAME  Caesar having resolved to give battle to Petreius and Afranius Pompey's lieutenants in Spain encamped near the enemy in the same field The behaviour of their soldiers at their seeing and knowing one another is the subject of the following verses  THeir antient friends as now they nearer drew  Prepar'd for fight the wondering soldiers knew  Brother with brother in unnat'ral strife  And the son arm'd against the father's life  Curst civil war then conscience first was felt  And the tough veteran's heart began to melt  Fix'd in dumb sorrow all at once they stand  Then wave a pledge of peace the guiltless hand  For vent ten thousand struggling passions move  The stings of nature and the pangs of love  All order broken wide their arms they throw  And run with transport to the longing foe  Here their longlost acquaintance neighbours claim  There an old friend recalls his comrade's name  Youths who in arts beneath one tutor grew  Rome rent in twain and kindred hosts they view  Tears wet their impious arms a fond relief  And kisses broke by sobs the words of grief  Tho' yet no blood was spilt each anxious mind  With horror thinks on what his rage design'd  Ah generous youths why thus with fruitless pain  Beat ye those breasts why gush those eyes in vain  Why blame ye heaven and charge your guilt on fate  Why dread the tyrant whom yourselves make great  Bids he the trumpet sound the trumpet slight  Bids he the standard move refuse the fight  Your generals left by you will love again  A son and father when they're private men  Kind concord heavenlyborn whose blissful reign  Holds this vast globe in one surrounding chain  Whose laws the jarring elements controul  And knit each atom close from pole to pole  Soul of the world and love's eternal spring  This lucky hour thy aid fair goddess bring  This lucky hour ere aggravated crimes  Heap guilt on guilt and doubly stain the times  No veil henceforth for sin for pardon none  They know their duty now their friends are known  Vain wish from blood short must the respite be  New crimes by love inhanc'd this night shall see  Such is the will of fate and such the hard decree  'Twas peace From either camp now void of fear  The soldiers mingling cheerful feasts prepare  On the green sod the friendly bowls were crown'd  And hasty banquets pil'd upon the ground  Around the fire they talk one shows his scars  One tells what chance first led him to the wars  Their stories o'er the tedious night prevail  And the mute circle listens to the tale  They own they fought but swear they ne'er could hate  Deny their guilt and lay the blame on fate  Their love revives to make them guiltier grow  A shortliv'd blessing but to heighten woe  When to Petreius first the news was told  The jealous general thought his legions sold  Swift with the guards his headstrong fury drew  From out his camp he drives the hostile crew  Cuts clasping friends asunder with his sword  And stains with blood each hospitable board  Then thus his wrath breaks out "Oh lost to fame  " Oh false to Pompey and the Roman name  " Can ye not conquer ye degenerate bands  " Oh die at least 'tis all that Rome demands  " What will ye own while ye can wield the sword  " A rebel standard and usurping lord  " Shall he be sued to take you into place  " Amongst his slaves and grant you equal grace  " What shall my life be begg'd inglorious thought  " And life abhorr'd on such conditions bought  " The toils we bear my friends are not for life  " Too mean a prize in such a dreadful strife  " But peace would lead to servitude and shame  " A fair amusement and a specious name  " Never had man explor'd the iron ore  " Mark'd out the trench or rais'd the lofty tower  " Ne'er had the steed in harness sought the plain  " Or fleets encounter'd on th' unstable main  " Were life were breath with fame to be compar'd  " Or peace to glorious liberty preferr'd  " By guilty oaths the hostile army bound  " Holds fast its impious faith and stands its ground  " Are you perfidious who espouse the laws  " And traytors only in a righteous cause  " Oh shame in vain thro' nations far and wide  " Thou call'st the crowding monarchs to thy side  " Fallen Pompey while thy legions here betray  " Thy cheap bought life and treat thy fame away"  He ended fierce The soldier's rage returns  His blood flies upward and his bosom burns  So hap'ly tam'd the tyger bears his bands  Less grimly growls and licks his keeper's hands  But if by chance he tastes forbidden gore  He yells amain and makes his dungeon roar  He glares he foams he aims a desperate bound  And his pale master flies the dangerous ground  Now deeds are done which man might charge aright  On stubborn fate or undiscerning night  Had not their guilt the lawless soldiers known  And made the whole malignity their own  The beds the plenteous tables float with gore  And breasts are stabb'd that were embrac'd before  Pity awhile their hands from slaughter kept  Inward they groan'd and as they drew they wept  But every blow their wavering rage assures  In murder hardens and to blood inures  Crowds charge on crowds nor friends their friends descry  But sires by sons and sons by fathers die  Black monstrous rage each with victorious cries  Drags his slain friend before the general's eyes  Exults in guilt that throws the only shame  On Pompey's cause and blots the Roman name  TO A LADY BEFORE MARRIAGE  BY THE SAME  OH form'd by nature and refin'd by art  With charms to win and sense to fix the heart  By thousands sought Clotilda canst thou free  Thy crowd of captives and descend to me  Content in shades obscure to waste thy life  A hidden beauty and a country wife  O listen while thy summers are my theme  Ah sooth thy partner in his waking dream  In some small hamlet on the lonely plain  Where Thames thro' meadows rolls his mazy train  Or where high Windsor thick with greens array'd  Waves his old oaks and spreads his ample shade  Fancy has figur'd out our calm retreat  Already round the visionary seat  Our limes begin to shoot our flowers to spring  The brooks to murmur and the birds to sing  Where dost thou lie thou thinlypeopled green  Thou nameless lawn and village yet unseen  Where sons contented with their native ground  Ne'er travell'd further than ten furlongs round  And the tann'd peasant and his ruddy bride  Were born together and together died  Where early larks best tell the morning light  And only Philomel disturbs the night  'Midst gardens here my humble pile shall rise  With sweets surrounded of ten thousand dies  All savage where th' embroider'd gardens end  The haunt of echoes shall my woods ascend  And oh if heaven th' ambitious thought approve  A rill shall warble cross the gloomy grove  A little rill o'er pebbly beds convey'd  Gush down the steep and glitter thro' the glade  What cheering scents those bordering banks exhale  How loud that heifer lows from yonder vale  That thrush how shrill his note so clear so high  He drowns each feather'd minstrel of the sky  Here let me trace beneath the purpled morn  The deepmouth'd beagle and the sprightly horn  Or lure the trout with welldissembled flies  Or fetch the fluttering partridge from the skies  Nor shall thy hand disdain to crop the vine  The downy peach or flavour'd nectarine  Or rob the beehive of its golden hoard  And bear th' unbought luxuriance to thy board  Sometimes my books by day shall kill the hours  While from thy needle rise the silken flowers  And thou by turns to ease my feeble sight  Resume the volume and deceive the night  Oh when I mark thy twinkling eyes opprest  Soft whispering let me warn my love to rest  Then watch thee charm'd while sleep locks every sense  And to sweet heaven commend thy innocence  Thus reign'd our fathers o'er the rural fold  Wife hale and honest in the days of old  Till courts arose where substance pays for show  And specious joys are bought with real woe  See Flavia's pendants large wellspread and right  The ear that wears them hears a fool each night  Mark how th' embroider'd col'nel sneaks away  To shun the withering dame that made him gay  That knave to gain a title lost his fame  That rais'd his credit by a daughter's shame  This coxcomb's ribband cost him half his land  And oaks unnumber'd bought that fool a wand  Fond man as all his sorrows were too few  Acquires strange wants that nature never knew  By midnight lamps he emulates the day  And sleeps perverse the cheerful suns away  From goblets highembost his wine must glide  Round his clos'd sight the gorgeous curtain slide  Fruits ere their time to grace his pomp must rise  And three untasted courses glut his eyes  For this are nature's gentle calls withstood  The voice of conscience and the bonds of blood  This wisdom thy reward for every pain  And this gay glory all thy mighty gain  Fair phantoms woo'd and scorn'd from age to age  Since bards began to laugh or priests to rage  And yet just curse on man's aspiring kind  Prone to ambition to example blind  Our childrens children shall our steps pursue  And the same errors be for ever new  Mean while in hope a guiltless country swain  My reed with warblings cheers th' imagin'd plain  Hail humble shades where truth and silence dwell  Thou noisy town and faithless court farewell  Farewell ambition once my darling flame  The thirst of lucre and the charm of fame  In life's byroad that winds thro' paths unknown  My days tho' number'd shall be all my own  Here shall they end O might they twice begin  And all be white the fates intend to spin  A POEM IN PRAISE OF THE HORNBOOK  WRITTEN UNDER A FIT OF THE GOUT  BY THE SAME  Magni

Physicians in mysterious cant express  T' amuse the patient and inhance their fees  So from the letters of our native tongue  Put in Greek scrauls a mystery too is sprung  Schools are erected puzzling

Greek letters Τ Δ  Tau's and Delta's make their mothers stare  Th' uncommon sounds amaze the vulgar ear  And what's uncommon never costs too dear  Yet in all tongues the Hornbook is the same  Taught by the Grecian sage or English dame  But how shall I thy endless virtues tell  In which thou dost all other books excel  No greasy thumb thy spotless leaf can foil  Nor crooked dogears thy smooth corners spoil  In idle pages no errata stand  To tell the blunders of the printer's hand  No fulsome dedication here is writ  Nor flattering verse to praise the author's wit  The margin with no tedious notes is vex'd  No various readings to confound the text  All parties in thy literal sense agree  Thou perfect centre of concordancy  Search we the records of an antient date  Or read what modern histories relate  They all proclaim what wonders have been done  By the plain letters taken as they run  "  The lines thus " marked describe the advice given to Augustus by Athenodorus the stoic philosopher who desired the emperor neither to say nor do any thing till he had first repeated the alphabet or letters of the Hornbook the strict observance of this rule would be the means to

Thee will I sing O parent Jove  And teach the world to praise and love  Yonder azure vault on high  Yonder blue low liquid sky  Earth on its firm basis plac'd  And with circling waves embrac'd  All creating power confess  All their mighty maker bless  Thou shak'st all nature with thy nod  Sea earth and air confess the God  Yet does thy powerful hand sustain  Both earth and heaven both firm and main  Scarce can our daring thoughts arise  To thy pavilion in the skies  Nor can Plato's self declare  The bliss the joy the rapture there  Barren above thou dost not reign  But circled with a glorious train  The sons of God the sons of light  Ever joying in thy sight  For thee their silver harps are strung  Ever beauteous ever young  Angelic forms their voices raise  And thro' heaven's

despise  The threatening vengeance of the skies  Whilst the pious on his guard  Undismay'd is still prepar'd  Life or death his mind's at rest  Since what thou send'st must needs be best  No evil can from thee proceed  'Tis only suffer'd not decreed  Darkness is not from the sun  Nor mount the shades till he is gone  Then does night obscene arise  From Erebus and fill the skies  Fantastic forms the air invade  Daughters of nothing and of shade  Can we forget thy guardian care  Slow to punish prone to spare  Thou break'st the haughty Persian's pride  That dar'd old Ocean's power deride  Their shipwrecks strew'd th' Eubean wave  At Marathon they found a grave  O ye blest Greeks who there expir'd  For Greece with pious ardor fir'd  What shrines or altars shall we raise  To secure your endless praise  Or need we monuments supply  To rescue what can never die  And yet  The Messiah foretold by Socrates  a greater hero far  Unless great Socrates could err  Shall rise to bless some future day  And teach to live and teach to pray  Come unknown instructor come  Our leaping hearts shall make thee room  Thou with Jove our vows shall share  Of Jove and thee we are the care  O father king whose heavenly face  Shines serene on all thy race  We thy magnificence adore  And thy wellknown aid implore  Nor vainly for thy help we call  Nor can we want for thou art all  THE HYMN OF  Cleanthes the author of this hymn was a stoic philosopher a disciple of Zeno He wrote many pieces none of which are come down to us but this and a few fragments which are printed by H Stephens in a collection of philosophical poems This hymn must give every sensible man pleasure to find such just sentiments of the deity in a heathen and so much poetry in a philosopher  CLEANTHES TO THE SUPREME GOD  TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK BY DR BOWDEN  GReat father of the skies whose boundless sway  Both gods above and worlds below obey  Thy laws sustain the universal frame  Various thy titles but thy power the same  Hail sovereign Jove all nations shall address  Their songs to thee who gave them tongues to bless  Behold thy image groveling on the earth  Faint echoes of thy voice which gave us birth  Then back will I reflect thy praises still  And sing the wonders of almighty skill  The wide expanse of yon etherial plain  And all below is subject to thy reign  The forked lightenings which with double glare  Sublimely wave and linger in the air  From thy dread arm with pointed fury fly  And ting'd with ruddy vengeance sweep the sky  The ray divine o'er all the frame presides  Glows in the sun and in the ocean glides  From thee each atom of creation springs  Hail great support of all inferior things  The orbs above and floating seas below  Move by thy laws and by thy influence flow  All rang'd in order know their destin'd place  All but the mad degenerate human race  But thou canst order from confusion bring  Bid peace from discord good from evil spring  And when all nature frowns and nations jar  Set calms in storms and harmony in war  Great Jove so justly fram'd the earthly ball  That universal good results from all  While common sense still shines with certain ray  And thro' the seeming maze points out the way  Yet thoughtless men to this blest convoy blind  Court the wild dictates of a restless mind  Perversely fly the universal light  And the sweet voice of heavenly reason slight  Unhappy men who toil and hunt for bliss  But the plain road of sacred wisdom miss  Led by this constant this unerring guide  Thro' flowery paths man's life would smoothly glide  But urg'd by passion heedless we pursue  The first mad pleasures that invite the view  Some avarice and sordid taste inspire  Ambition some and fame's ungovern'd fire  Soft luxury some and Cyprian charms delight  While all rush forward to the heaven in sight  But thou who thunderest in the vault above  Correct these vain desires O bounteous Jove  Let godlike reason in our bosoms dwell  And from weak minds this lunacy expel  A ray of wisdom on our souls bestow  By which thou rul'st all nature's scene below  Then with devotion fir'd we'll hail thee king  And in eternal songs thy wonders sing  No greater good can men or gods attend  Than at thy throne with prostrate hearts to bend  AN HYMN TO THE CREATOR  BY THE REV MR MERRICK  GOD of my health whose bounteous care  First gave me power to move  How shall my thankful heart declare  The wonders of thy love  While void of thought and sense I lay  Dust of my parent earth  Thy breath inform'd the sleeping clay  And call'd me into birth  From thee my parts their fashion took  And ere my life begun  Within the volume of thy book  Were written one by one  Thy eye beheld in open view  The yet unfinish'd plan  The shadowy lines thy pencil drew  And form'd the future man  O may this frame that rising grew  Beneath thy plastic hands  Be studious ever to pursue  Whate'er thy will commands  The soul that moves this earthly load  Thy semblance let it bear  Nor lose the traces of the God  That stamp'd his image there  A SACRED LYRIC  ON BEING WAKED IN THE NIGHT BY A VIOLENT STORM OF THUNDER AND LIGHTENING  LOck'd in the arms of balmy sleep  From every care of day  As silent as the folded sheep  And as secure I lay  Sudden tremendous thunders roll  Quick lightenings round me glare  The solemn scene alarms my soul  And wakes the heart to prayer  Whate'er O Lord at this still hour  These awful sounds portend  Whether sole ensigns of thy power  Or groans for nature's end  Grant me to bear with equal mind  These terrors of the sky  For ever as thou wilt resign'd  Alike to live or die  If wak'd by thy vindictive hand  This mighty tempest stirs  That peal the voice of thy command  These flames thy messengers  Welcome the bolt where'er it fall  Beneath the passing sun  Thy righteous will determines all  And let that will be done  But if as nature's laws ordain  Nor destin'd by thy will  Each bolt exerts its wide domain  Selfauthoriz'd to kill  Quick interpose allgracious Lord  In this remorseless night  Arise and be alike ador'd  For mercy as for might  Vouchsafe amidst this time of dread  Thy suppliant's voice to hear  O shield from harm each friendly head  And all my soul holds dear  Let it not kill where riot foul  Pours forth the drunken jest  Nor where the guiltenvenom'd soul  Starts wild from troubled rest  A while O spare those sinful breasts  Whose deeds the night deform  Nor strike where smiling virtue rests  Unconscious of the storm  Succour the couch where beauty lies  All pale with tender fear  Where sickness lifts its languid eyes  O pour thy comforts there  Nor useless waste this moral night  Like common hours away  But glow with wisdom's sacred light  More fair than orient day  Warn'd by each flash may virtue rise  And with its glories spread  While every blasted bud of vice  Shrinks in new terrors dead  So on that awful judgment day  Whose image shakes the soul  Tho' keenest lightenings shoot their ray  And loudest thunders roll  Well pleas'd O Lord each eye shall see  Those final thunders hurl'd  And mark with joy for love of thee  That flash which melts the world  A HYMN OCCASIONED BY THE SIXTYFIFTH PSALM  BY JS  LET praise to that almighty sovereign rise  Who fix'd the mountains and who spread the skies  Who o'er his works extends paternal care  Whose kind protection all the nations share  From the glad climes whence morn in beauty drest  Forth goes rejoicing to the farthest west  On him alone their whole dependence lies  And his rich mercy every want supplies  O thou great author of th' extended whole  Revolving seasons praise thee as they roll  By thee spring summer autumn winter rise  Thou giv'st the frowning thou the smiling skies  By thy command the softening shower distills  Till genial warmth the teeming furrow fills  Then fav'ring sunshine o'er the clime extends  And blest by thee the verdant blade ascends  Next spring's gay products cloath the flowery hills  And joy the wood and joy the valley fills  Then soon thy bounty swells the golden ear  And bids the harvest crown the fruitful year  Thus all thy works conspicuous worship raise  And nature's face proclaims her maker's praise  HYMN FROM PSALM VIII  BY THE SAME  ALmighty power amazing are thy ways  Above our knowledge and above our praise  How all thy works thy excellence display  How fair how great how wonderful are they  Thy hand yon wideextended heaven uprais'd  Yon wideextended heaven with stars emblaz'd  Where each bright orb since time his course begun  Has roll'd a mighty world or shin'd a sun  Stupendous thought how sinks all human race  A point an atom in the field of space  Yet even to us O Lord thy care extends  Thy bounty feeds us and thy power defends  Yet even to us as delegates of thee  Thou giv'st dominion over land and sea  Whate'er or walks on earth or flits in air  Whate'er of life the watery regions bear  All these are ours and for th' extensive claim  We owe due homage to thy sacred name  Almighty power how wond'rous are thy ways  How far above our knowledge and our praise  TRUST IN GOD A POEM  BY PETER PINNELL MA  Why art thou so full of heaviness O my soul and why art thou disquieted within me  PUT THY TRUST IN GOD  Ps XLII  WHY droops the head why languishes the eye  What mean the flowing tear and frequent sigh  Where are the lenient med'cines to impart  Their balmy virtue to a bleeding heart  Fruitless are all attempts for kind relief  To mix her cordial and allay my grief  So strong my anguish so severe my pain  Weak is philosophy and reason vain  Such rules like fuel make my passion glow  Quicken each pang and point the sting of woe  Imagination labours but in vain  While darkening clouds intoxicate the brain  Fancy no sweet ideas can suggest  To lull the raging tumult in my breast  In vain or mirth invites or friendship calls  Wit dies a jest and conversation palls  Nature and art supply fresh springs of care  And each obtruding thought creates despair  No scenes amuse me that amus'd before  And what delighted once delights no more  Tho' all creation beautiful appears  And nature's aspect a rich verdure wears  Yet still her bloom with sickening eyes I see  And all her luxury is lost on me  The budding plants of variegated hue  The blossoms opening with the morning dew  The vernal breeze that gently fans the bowers  The laughing meadows and enlivening showers  Th' enamell'd garden where the works of art  Give strength to nature and fresh charms impart  Where gaudy pinks and blushing roses bloom  Rich in array and pregnant with perfume  Where Flora smiling sees her offspring vie  To spread their beauties and regale the eye  All all in vain with charms united glow  To deck the scene or gild the face of woe  So when the morning lark ascending sings  While joy attunes his voice and mounts his wings  Tho' to his cheerful notes the hills reply  And warbling music gladdens all the sky  Still in his strains no pleasing charms I find  No sweet enchantment to compose my mind  In vain the sun his gaudy pride displays  No genial warmth attends his brightest rays  And when his absent light the moon supplies  Or planets glitter to enrich the skies  No gleam of comfort from their lustre flows  No harbinger of peace or calm repose  But gloomy vapours o'er the night prevail  And pestilence is spread in every gale  Thus weaken'd by a gradual decay  Life's bitter cup I drink without allay  Nor taste the blessing of one cheerful day  Come then kind death thy sharpest steel prepare  Here point the dart and snatch me from despair  But stop O man thy plaintive strains suppress  With Christian patience learn to acquiesce  Th' instructive voice of reason calmly hear  And let religion check the flowing tear  Whate'er the will of providence assigns  'Tis Infidelity alone repines  But those who trust in God disdain to grieve  And what our father sends with joy receive  Whose sharp corrections testify his love  And certain blessings in the end will prove  Who sees how man would err without controul  Afflicts the body to improve the soul  And by chastizing part preserves the whole  Hence tho' darklowering skies and angry gales  Conspire to raise the storm and rend the sails  Yet if calm reason at the helm preside  My little bark will stem both wind and tide  And adverse currents shall at last convey  The shatter'd vessel to the realms of day  Thus taught by Faith how rash it is and vain  For man mere dust and ashes to complain  My soul with sad disquietude opprest  Directs her flight to heaven in search of rest  And refuge takes which "peace at last will bring"  Beneath the shadow of th' Almighty's wing  On him I fix my mind and place my trust  A Being infinitely wise and just  And should his providence new beams create  To brighten the complexion of my fate  A cheerful tribute to his throne I'll raise  And stamp my song with gratitude and praise  But should indulgence suit not his designs  Who evil into happiness refines  Let due submission make my burden light  And may I thinkWhatever is is right  Then "be not thou disquieted my soul"  Have lively faithand "faith will make thee whole"  When heaven inflicts with calmness bear the stroke  Since to repine is only to provoke  Learn to adore the justice of thy God  And kiss the sacred hand that holds the rod  That sacred hand which first the heart explores  Probes every wound and searches all the sores  Then the right med'cine properly applies  To cleanse the part where all th' infection lies  Hear this thou coward man nor dread the smart  Which tho' it stings will purify the heart  For resignation will promote the cure  And tho' the means are sharp the end is sure  Since then afflictions are thro' mercy sent  To be of good the happy instrument  Since for the noblest ends they are design'd  To form the judgment to improve the mind  To curb our passions to direct our love  To awe mankind and speak a God above  O may I view them with religion's eye  Nor lose the guard of virtue till I die  Hence shall I taste the sweets that evils bring  And suck the honey while I feel the sting  Hence shall I learn the bitter cup to bless  And drink it as a draught of happiness  A wholesome potion which tho' mix'd with gall  May still preserve my life my soul my all  Thus fix'd my heart tho' fruit should fail the vine  The figtree sicken and its bloom decline  The labour of the olive be in vain  And flocks infected perish on the plain  Tho' corn and oil and wine at once decrease  The fields grow barren and the harvest cease  Tho baffled hinds their fruitless toil deplore  And vales uncheerful laugh and sing no more  Yet still with gladness would I serve the Lord  Adore his wisdom and obey his word  Hear then O God regard a suppliant's prayer  Sooth all my pangs and save me from despair  Illuminate my soul with gladsome rays  And tune my voice to thy eternal praise  Dispel the clouds of darkness from my eyes  And make me know that to be good is wise  Let christian precepts all my soul employ  And be not more my duty than my joy  Let conscience void of art and free from guile  Still in my bosom innocently smile  Her cheerful beams will gild the gloom of fate  And make me happy in whatever state  Hence shall I learn my talent to improve  If poor by patience and if rich by love  If fortune smiles let me be virtue's friend  And where I go let charity attend  Within my bosom let compassion dwell  To soften all the woes which others feel  T' asswage by kind relief affliction's sighs  And wipe the falling tear from widows eyes  To feed the hungry the distress'd to cheer  The needy succour and the feeble rear  Hence shall my mind inflam'd with public good  Unshaken stand in midst of plenty's flood  Hence shall I scorn temptation's gilded bait  Look with disdain on all the pomp of state  And by humility be truly great  But should it be thy blessed will to spread  Clouds of thick darkness lowering o'er my head  Let me have grace to know they are design'd  To check my follies and correct my mind  Let me have grace to know in my distress  I still to thee may have a free access  And be an heir tho' all the world should frown  Of heavenly glory and a future crown  From these reflections true contentment flows  Contentmentsuch as grandeur seldom knows  Hence in the lowly cot a relish springs  Above the taste of courts and pride of kings  Thus in the flood of wealth be thou my guide  And steer my course 'twixt avarice and pride  Or in the ebb of fortune teach my mind  To know its duty and to be resign'd  Prepare me to receive or good or ill  As the result of thy almighty will  Thy will whose chief design and general plan  Tend to promote the happiness of man  Be every sensual appetite suppress'd  Nor the least taint lie lurking in my breast  Let steady reason my affections guide  And calm content sit smiling by my side  Teach me with scorn to view the things below  As gaudy phantoms and an empty show  But guide my wishes to the things above  As the sole object of a christian's love  Make me reflect on my eternal home  A dying Saviour and a life to come  Direct me virtue's happy course to run  And let me as instructed by thy son  In every station say Thy will be done  ON THE DEATH OF LADY SHAW  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLI  BY THE SAME  Ostendunt terris hanc tantum fata neque ultra  Esse sinunt  VIRG  THus death the king of terrors spoke  " Be sure the aim and home the stroke  " My will despotic has decreed  " The fairest sacrifice shall bleed  " To gratify my wanton pride  " Where do the graces all reside  " Where shall the pointed arrow fly  " That each may sicken pine and die  " Where can the stroke be so severe  " To make all nature drop a tear  " Soon as among the fair I see  " Perfection's bright epitome  " I'll vent my fury fix her doom  " And in its verdure nip the bloom  " Tho' all the various charms combin'd  " Of person intellect and mind  " Still unsuccessful they should plead  " To stop my dart or check its speed  " No softendearing smiles of youth  " Goodnature innocence or truth  "

does so quickly waste  It bids me think the present day my last  Tho' narrow limits thy short date confine  Compar'd to infinitewhat more is mine  This day must end thy being and before  Tomorrow's dawn myself may be no more  Both in life's morn with gayest lustre shine  And as the night advances both decline  Both by one common fate seem closely link'd  And after one short blaze shall be extinct  Our lives the same our periods both agree  So where's the difference 'twixt you and me  ADVICE TO A YOUNG LADY ON SEEING HER DANCE  BY THE SAME  O may you walk as years advance  Smooth and erect as now you dance  May you on each important stage  From bloom of youth to wither'd age  Assert your claim to merit's prize  And as at present charm our eyes  Observant of decorum's laws  And moving with the same applause  May you thro' life's perplexing maze  Direct your steps with equal praise  Its intricate meanders trace  With regularity and grace  From the true figure never swerve  And time in every step observe  Give ear to harmony and reason  Nor make one motion out of season  Thus will life's current gently flow  And pour forth every bliss below  Till nature failing ebb shall bring  Death with his dartbut not his sting  TO A LADY ON ASKING MY OPINION OF FRIENDSHIP  BY THE SAME  WOuld Chloe know the highest bliss  That friendship boastsit must be this  When Hymen crowns what Love begun  And two fond hearts unite in one  When each as to delight or pain  Is bound in sympathetic chain  And both reciprocally borrow  To heighten joy or sweeten sorrow  This is the highest bliss below  This friendship only can bestow  And may propitious heaven design  That such a friendship shall be mine  And since this wish relates to two  O may that friendship be with you  TO SYLVIA  PRESENTED WITH A RING BEARING A HEART WITH THIS MOTTOSTOP THIEF  SOon as I saw those beauteous eyes  You play'd a roguish part  You first enthrall'd me by surprize  Then robb'd me of my heart  Since thus you now may boast of two  Disputing is in vain  Render to me your own in lieu  Or give me mine again  If not tho' you're by all confest  The masterpiece of nature  I'll paint you to the world at best  A doublehearted creature  TO A LADY WITH A BOOK OF MORALITY ENTITLED "VISIONS"  " SO strong the passions of the human mind  " To truth reluctant and to reason blind  " These rules compar'd with real life must seem  " All airy visions and an empty dream  " For when a plan of conduct we would draw  " That dares the critic's eye to show a flaw  " Fancy may wish its antitype to see  " And feast upon its charms in theory  " Yet still in practice all our hopes are vain  " To realize this image of the brain"  Thus foe to nature spoke the gloomy sage  But let his labour'd lines inform the page  Let him exhaust his genius to display  Truth's pleasant path and virtue's peaceful way  Each moral rule with energy dispense  That forms the conduct or improves the sense  Still must philosophy renounce the prize  Still nature must to art superior rise  For nature now triumphantly can show  A living instance of those rules in you  A SUPPLICATION  BY A LADY JUST BEFORE MARRIAGE  PRepare me O almighty Lord  For that important day  When I shall plight my solemn word  To "honour and obey"  When at thy sacred altar I  With trembling feet shall stand  Be thy eternal spirit by  To join the heart and hand  United thus no human force  Can part the happy pair  But life will run a cheerful course  Of sunshine all the year  Yet still as pleasure's cup enjoy'd  A bitter draught may prove

love abound suspicion cease  Let wrath be swallow'd up in peace  And discord rage no more  Thus gratitude shall teach my heart  To chuse thro' life the better part  And thee my God adore  This is the humble prayer I make  When I my Damon's hand shall take  That we from care exempt  May see our moments flow serene  And still preserve the golden mean  'Twixt envy and contempt  ORIGINAL FABLES  IMITATED FROM A FRENCH MANUSCRIPT OF MR CAZOTTE  BY MR CHARLES DENIS  FABLE I THE DISTRIBUTION OF GIFTS  JOve once 'tis said was angry grown  With all mankind and we must own  With reason too th' ungrateful race  Dar'd even to their maker's face  Unthinking insolent and vain  Presume of hardships to complain  Say did not I thus spoke the god  Create at will that human clod  Endow it with a soul divine  That attribute a spark of mine  Did I not place him on yon ball  That earth and make him lord of all  Did I not give him full command  O'er every creature in the land  O'er all that in the waters swim  O'er all that thro' light ether skim  Nay more I gave a loving wife  To be the solace of his life  A fair one too Jove swears and vows  He'd gladly club for such a spouse  For Jove we know would now and then  By way of frolick act like men  The very being of a state  Consists of small as well as great  From first to last there must be ranks  Man's blest in all yet gives no thanks  To every one Jove's bounty flows  To these bright honours wealth to those  And they who dwell in humble cot  May boast indeed the happiest lot  Instead of grandeur pomp and wealth  I give them mirth content and health  Nay some have still a luckier hit  As country squire and London cit  Great appetites and little wit  What would ungrateful mortals have  How dare they say Jove nothing gave  To please mankind's no easy task  Give e'er so much they've more to ask  FABLE II ALEXANDER'S STICK  GOD Alexander it was said  Like mortal man lay sick in bed  Without'tis said withoutwe hear  How can a fabulist appear  Once on a dayonce on a night  Time out of mindare ours of right  So far digrest let's retrograde  Like others of the rhyming trade  And tell our story as we can  This son of Jove was but a man  In bed we left him and no doubt  You long to know his ailthe gout  The gout are kings tormented thus  Have they infirmities like us  Why not one clay makes up our frame  And kings and subjects are the same  It happen'd where our god was sick  That on the carpet lay a stick  Yes a crabstick by chance lay there  No matter how or whence or where  The wanted stick was valued much  And soon was fashion'd into crutch  And now the monarch's dear support  He thinks himself like some at court  Of such importance to the state  All must on him obsequious wait  Such merit never can be slighted  And to be sure he will be knighted  And then aloud how fame will blab  That he is dubb'd Sir Broomstick Crab  Favour at court I've often read  Intoxicates the wisest head  If so ye courtiers by your leave  How must a simpleton behave  Sir Crab now hopes to be his grace  Since he supplies the sceptre's place  For if a sceptre's really good  Be it of silver gold or wood  'Tis not the matter which we prize  In merit all the difference lies  Merit I have no doubt or why  Should this great king on me rely  Last night his generals around him  Had left him all just as they found him  But with my help the godlike man  Of future conquests form'd the plan  Trac'd in the sand in case of need  How to fall back and when proceed  Here we make war there peace proclaim  With us great folks 'tis all the same  Yet we'll pursue an honest plan  And fix the limitsif we can  But who shall check our bold career  Ambition knows of no barrier  Not rapid Ganges deep and wide  Its bordering kingdoms can divide  If so these kingdoms all shall prove  What 'tis t' oppose the son of Jove  Thus whilst our newmade courtier fed  The wild chimera in his head  Some rest the gouty hero gains  He finds a respite from his pains  And growing better every day  The useless stick is thrown away  By this example warning take  Ye courtiers ye who dream awake  Courtfavours are precarious things  The wind will changeand so may kings  FABLE III JUPITER AND THE POET  IN angry mood Jove once they say  That god comes often in my way  Vow'd he'd chastise a certain bard  For want of reverence and regard  What Jupiter have passions then  Read Homer and your gods are men  A thing call'd poet what his name  Or who he is or whence he came  It matters not would have his joke  Of gods irreverently spoke  And to enhance his fund of sin  With Jove himself must needs begin  Haste Vulcan to thy forge and fetch  That bolt doom'd for the greatest wretch  But staybring with thee great and small  In one dread heap I'll lanch them all  A dire example he shall prove  To all such bards as sneer at Jove  Vulcan his orders strait obey'd  The whole creation shakes dismay'd  Redoubl'd thunder roars aloud  And from the thick collected cloud  Keen lightnings darting thro' the sky  In serpentine meanders fly  Earth dreads lest from her axis whirl'd  She be again to chaos hurl'd  And where's the poet all this while  Asleep and sleeping seems to smile  Ah soon he'll feel the vengeful blast  That sleep will surely be his last  No he awakes calm and serene  Unconscious of the dismal scene  He to Jove's wrath his safety owes  The dart must err which passion throws  For all these bolts together tumbled  In wild confusion only rumbled  Thro' vacant skies are vainly tost  And all the expedition's lost  Some few tho' guiltless bore the shock  And here an oak and there a rock  Torn up o'erthrown in woeful plight  Proclaim'd the horrors of the night  Now had this wrathenkindled god  Seiz'd a stout broomstick or a rod  Instead of all this mighty din  A mercy on the poet's skin  FABLE IV THE FROG AND THE RAT  ONce on a time a foolish frog  Vain proud and stupid as a log  For 'tis an axiom of the school  Who argues proud concludes a fool  Tir'd with the marsh her native home  Imprudently abroad would roam  And fix her habitation where  She'd breathe at least a purer air  She was resolv'd to change that's poss  Could she be worse than where she was  Away the silly creature leaps  A rat who saw her lab'ring steps  Cry'd out where in this hurry pray  You certainly will go astray  Ne'er fear I quit that filthy bog  Where I so long have croak'd incog  People of talents sure should thrive  And not be buried thus alive  But pray for I'm extremely dry  Know you of any water nigh  None said the rat you'll reach to day  As you so slowly make your way  Believe a friend and take my word  This jaunt of yours is quite absurd  Go to your froggery again  In your own element remain  No on the journey she was bent  Her thirst increasing as she went  For want of drink she scarce can hop  And yet despairing of a drop  Too late she moans her folly past  She faints she sinks she breathes her last  Frogs in your marshes be content  Dry land for you was never meant  Some breathe in dry some in moist air  But all should live within their sphere  THE YOUNG WIDOW A FABLE  BY MR C DENIS  HUlse shook his headpoor Damon lay a dying  And close by his bedside his wife sat crying  O stay she said and must we part  My soul like thine is on the wing  Methinks I feel death's iron dart  But oh 'tis that which wounds thy heart  That bears to mine the sting  Her grief was great so was her moan  And much to die she seem'd inclin'd  Howe'er she let him go alone  And prudently remain'd behind  A week or so was past and gone  Still she continued weeping on  When to her house her father came  And thus address'd the mournful dame  My child said he enough of tears you've shed  Think of the living and forget the dead  Another spousedon't startle at the word  'Tis but a second you may have a third  As soon as decency permits  I have a husband to propose  Young handsome rich just one of those  That's form'd to cure a widow's fits  Ah sir is this a father's part  To wound afresh a bleeding heart  Shall I another husband wed  Oh no my only love is dead  Nor will I other wedding have  'Till I am bedded in his grave  The father left her to digest  The wise and prudent things he said  He put the husband in her head  And time he knew would do the rest  The cares of mourning next took place  To dress her grief and suit her face  'Twas Cupid's thought for what exceeds  A pretty widow in her weeds  And now each lookingglass could tell  That black became her vastly well  The smiles and graces that were scar'd away  With all the band of little loves  And Cytherea's doves  Came dropping in each day  The father if report says true  Another visit made ere mourning over  I'm glad my dear said he so well to find you  But mention'd not a word of the new lover  At which she blush'dmust I then sir remind you  The thing's too serious to be made a joke of  Where is the husband pray that once you spoke of  Wide is the difference as you see it here  'Twixt widow of a day and widow of a year  All lenient time expands his wings  Away he flies with human cares  Then back full fraught with joy repairs  And every balmy comfort brings  Time checks the mourning husband's sighs  'Tis he congeals the falling tear  To form the lovely lucid leer  Which sparkles in a widow's eyes  ON THE ROYAL NUPTIALS  TO THE QUEEN  BY MRS P  WHen every tongue great George's praise recites  And heartfelt gratitude the verse indites  May I my wishes for his weal impart  In words that speak the language of the heart  May I the humblest of the muses train  Presume to join them in the lofty strain  Yes yes the inspiring muse now darts her ray  And bids to Charlotte thus devote the lay  Deign then O queen to view this humble wreath  And on the flowery band acceptance breathe  Myrtles as fragrant as thy George's name  Whose incense rises on the wings of fame  Fresh have I cull'd from Pindus' sacred shade  With blooming flowerets that can never fade  Emblems of virtues that thy George adorn  Foretelling blessings to an age unborn  Laurels unchanging join the mystic band  Which speak the glories of this conquering land  These royal Charlotte by the muse consign'd  Trembling I weave thy sacred brow to bind  The wreath thus form'd receive it gracious queen  And mark the virtues that in George are seen  His name by generous deeds illustrious grown  Now shines the brightest jewel in his crown  Fair honour sits enthron'd upon his brow  Where youth and beauty like these flowerets grow  Virtue and truth his steady footsteps wait  And mercy smiling cherub opes his gate  At his example vice astonish'd falls  And dreads an exile from our happy walls  Religion now fresh beams her cheering ray  And heaven's vicegerent gladly owns the sway  True filial piety his bosom warms  And social fondness in the monarch charms  From his bright pattern every blessing springs  The best of sons of brothers and of kings  What more remain'd to form the godlike youth  Paternal fondness and connubial truth  Lo now approving angels gracious bring  A consort worthy Albion's virtuous king  Graces celestial to her mind belong  Humble tho' great and sagely wise tho' young  England's old genius like himself appears  And points exulting to the coming years  With joy paternal bids obedient fame  To trembling nations British George proclaim  Long may he reign encircled with renown  Fair as his virtues mighty as his crown  May sweet domestic bliss unmix'd with care  And soft content your rising hours prepare  May each succeeding year new transport bring  And truth and wisdom bloom perpetual spring  Long may the people and the king contest  Who most revere who love each other best  May his dread sceptre horrid war bid cease  And awe perfidious nations into peace  May homefelt bliss the cares of state beguile  The parent's rapture at the cherubsmile  The joys refin'd to rear the budding flower  And taste its sweetness in the vernal hour  Joys such as lov'd lamented Frederick knew  Beneath whose care his infant virtues grew  Like good Augusta be great Charlotte seen  Nor lose the mother in the mighty queen  And late oh late may heaven's dread mandate come  Which calls the mortal to his native home  Then may some radiant spirit guide your way  To the bless'd regions of eternal day  There brighter crown'd amidst the sacred throng  In strains celestial join the seraph's song  ON OCCASION OF THE PEACE A POEM  BY F F  Peace o'er the world her olive wand extends  And whiterob'd innocence from heaven descends  POPE  A Dieu the horrors of destructive war  And mad Bellona in her iron car  But welcome to our smiling fields again  Sweet peace attended with thy jocund train  Truth virtue freedom that can never cloy  And all the pleasing family of joy  Those schemes pursued which Pitt so wisely plan'd  Conquest has shower'd her blessings on the land  And Britain's sons more laurels have obtain'd  Than all her Henries or her Edwards gain'd  George saw with joy the peaceful period given  And bow'd obedient to the will of heaven  Awful he rose to bid dissention cease  And all the warring world was calm'd to peace  " Thus did the roaring waves their rage compose  " When the great father of the floods arose"  Then came Astrea mild our isle to bless  Fair queen of virtue and of happiness  Then came our troops in fighting fields renown'd  And mark'd with many an honourable wound  The tender fair one long by fears opprest  Now feels soft raptures rising in her breast  The blooming hero of her heart to view  And hear him bid the dangerous camp adieu  The widow'd bride that long on grief had fed  And bath'd with weeping the deserted bed  Glad that the tumults of the war are o'er  That terror rage and rapine are no more  Greets her rough lord secure from hostile harms  And hopes an age of pleasure in his arms  While he with pompous eloquence recites  Dire scenes of castles storm'd and desperate sights  Or tells how Wolfe the freeborn Britons led  How Granby conquer'd and the Household fled  She to the pleasing dreadful tale intent  Now smiles now trembles for the great event  O curst ambition foe to human good  Pregnant with woe and prodigal of blood  Thou fruitful source whence streams of sorrow flow  What devastations to thy guilt we owe  Wheree'er thy fury riots all around  Confusion havoc and dread deaths abound  Where Ceres flourish'd and gay Flora smil'd  Behold a barren solitary wild  To stately cedars thorns and briars succeed  And in the garden spreads the noxious weed  Where cattle pastured late the purple plain  Sad scene of horror teems with heroes slain  Where the proud palace rear'd its haughty head  Deep in the dust see crumbling columns spread  See gallant Britons in the field expire  Towns turn'd to ashes fanes involv'd in fire  These deeds the guilt of rash ambition tell  And bloody discord furious fiend of hell  Ye baneful sisters with your frantic crew  Hence speed your flight and take your last adieu  Eternal wars in barbarous worlds to wage  There vent your inextinguishable rage  But come fair Peace and be the nation's bride  And let thy sister Plenty grace thy side  O come and with thy placid presence cheer  Our drooping hearts and stay for ever here  Now be the shrill strifestirring trumpet mute  Now let us listen to the softer lute  The shepherd now his numerous flocks shall feed  Where war relentless doom'd the brave to bleed  On ruin'd ramparts shall the hawthorn flower  And mantling ivy clasp the nodding tower  Unusual harvests wave along the dale  And the bent sickle o'er the sword prevail  No more shall states with rival rage contend  But arts their empire o'er the world extend  Ingenuous arts that humanize the mind  And give the brightest polish to mankind  Then shall our chiefs in breathing marble stand  And life seem starting from the sculptor's hand  Then lovely nymphs in living picture rise  The fairest faces and the brightest eyes  There  The hon mrs Lane daughter of the right hon lord chancellor Henley and wife to the hon mr Lane  polish'd Lane no loss of beauty fears  Her charms still mellowing with revolving years  Shall ev'n on canvas youthful hearts engage  And warm the cold indifference of age  Then the firm arch shall stem the roaring tide  And join those countries which the streams divide  Then villas rise of true palladian proof  And the proud palace rear its ample roof  Then statelier temples to the skies ascend  Where mix'd with nobles mighty kings may bend  Where poverty may send her sighs to heaven  And guilt return repent and be forgiven  Such are the fruits which sacred peace imparts  Sweet nurse of liberty and learned arts  These she restoresO that she could restore  Life to those Britons who now breathe no more  Who in th' embattled field undaunted stood  And greatly perish'd in their country's good  Or who by rage of angry tempests tost  In whirlpools of the whelming main were lost  Ye honour'd shades of chiefs untimely slain  Whose bones lie scatter'd on some foreign plain  That now perchance by lonely hind are seen  In glittering armour gliding o'er the green  Ye that beneath the cold cerulean wave  Have made the watery element your grave  Whose wandering spirits haunt the winding shore  Or ride on whirlwinds while the billows roar  With kind protection still our isle defend  If souls unbodied can protection lend  Still o'er the king your shadowy pinions spread  And in the day of danger shield his head  Your bright examples shall our pattern be  To make us valiant and to keep us free  Dec  ODE ON DARKNESS  'TIS now the dreary hour of night  When darkness shuts the sense of sight  Where sparkles now that florid grace  That sat enthron'd on nature's face  That golden flood of glory where  That stream'd its lustre thro' the air  That private zephyrquivering shade  Where Thyrsis woo'd his lovely maid  Alas the sun alas the shade  Where Thyrsis woo'd his lovely maid  Are vanish'd and the watery dyke  And flowery bank have charms alike  The velvet lawn the treetopt hill  The fertile mead the neighb'ring rill  And all that lately pleas'd my eye  In undistinguish'd darkness lie  Oh darkness each extreme degree  Is reconcil'd alone by thee  What now avail Lucinda's eyes  That wont to dazzle and surprize  Or what the captivating charms  Of Stella's lillycolour'd arms  Since none the difference can see  'Twixt beauty and deformity  Involv'd in terror on his bed  The wretch of guilt reclines his head  Reclines and wishes for repose  That friendly balm of human woes  In vain for gentle sleep denies  With magic wand to close his eyes  And should he nod he dreams despair  And wakens to redoubled care  Then spectred forms before him sweep  Imaginary foes to sleep  Whilst every whistling breath of wind  Adds deeper horror to his mind  He sweats in tremor sinks his head  To every sense of comfort dead  With pain reflects attempts to pray  And yearns to see the glimpse of day  Not so the steady tranquil man  Who acts by reason's virtuous plan  No wild fantastic thoughts controul  The settled firmness of his soul  For thro' the gloomy veil of night  He sees a constant sacred light  That beams its unremitting ray  And changes darkness into day  WW  JANUARY AN ODE  ON yon black cloud behold Aquarius stand  Poising an ample urn in either hand  The load he sways then swiftly pours  In cataracts the deluge down  The rough wind howls discordant with the showers  Whilst nature knits each feature to a frown  The dripping poultry seek the closest sheds  The pensive warblers droop their little heads  Nor without cause No gilding ray  Breaks thro' the foggy veil of air  But all is picturesque of blank dismay  Engendering spirits of extreme despair  Is this th' unpleasing foretaste of the year  And does the first month meet me with a tear  And shall not better days ensue  The soul to cherish and sustain  Shall no bright prospects lengthen to the view  No river smile no landscape charm again  Lo fly the clouds the sun renews his ray  Aquarius adds a lustre to the day  To globes of ice each freezing urn  Transforms The crown which late he wore  Surcharg'd with wet condenses in its turn  And looks a substance of selfpolish'd ore  Now round the board my friends in concert join  And drown despair in copious floods of wine  Vulcan sit down and blow the fire  And Bacchus thou my butler be  Approach my Genius fill the goblet higher  I'll have no other Ganymede but thee  WW  END OF VOL I
