 POEMS BY WILLIAM COWPER ESQ  VOL II  THE TASK A POEM IN SIX BOOKS  BY WILLIAM COWPER OF THE INNER TEMPLE ESQ  Fit surculus arbor  ANONYM  To which are added BY THE SAME AUTHOR An EPISTLE to JOSEPH HILL Esq TIROCINIUM or a REVIEW of SCHOOLS and the HISTORY of JOHN GILPIN  LONDON PRINTED FOR J JOHNSON N  o  ST PAUL'S CHURCHYARD  ADVERTISEMENT  THE history of the following production is briefly this A lady fond of blank verse demanded a poem of that kind from the author and gave him the SOFA for a subject He obeyed and having much leisure connected another subject with it and pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of mind led him brought forth at length instead of the trifle which he at first intended a serious affaira Volume  In the poem on the subject of education he would be very sorry to stand suspected of having aimed his censure at any particular school His objections are such as naturally apply themselves to schools in general If there were not as for the most part there is wilful neglect in those who manage them and  an omission even of such discipline as they are susceptible of the objects are yet too numerous for minute attention and the aching hearts of ten thousand parents mourning under the bitterest of all disappointments attest the truth of the allegation His quarrel therefore is with the mischief at large and not with any particular instance of it  ARGUMENT of the FIRST BOOK  Historical deduction of seats from the stool to the Sofa A Schoolboys rambleA walk in the countryThe scene describedRural sounds as well as

fatal effects of dissipation and effeminacy upon our public measures  BOOK I  THE SOFA  I SING the SOFA I who lately sang  Truth Hope and Charity and touch'd with awe  The solemn chords and with a trembling hand  Escap'd with pain from that advent'rous flight  Now seek repose upon an humbler theme  The theme though humble yet august and proud  Th' occasionfor the Fair commands the song  Time was when cloathing sumptuous or for use  Save their own painted skins our sires had none  As yet black breeches were not sattin smooth  Or velvet soft or plush with shaggy pile  The hardy chief upon the rugged rock  Wash'd by the sea or on the grav'ly bank  Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud  Fearless of wrong repos'd his weary strength  Those barb'rous ages past succeeded next  The birthday of invention weak at first  Dull in design and clumsy to perform  Jointstools were then created on three legs  Upborne they stood Three legs upholding firm  A massy slab in fashion square or round  On such a stool immortal Alfred sat  And sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms  And such in ancient halls and mansions drear  May still be seen but perforated sore  And drill'd in holes the solid oak is found  By worms voracious eating through and through  At length a generation more refined  Improv'd the simple plan made three legs four  Gave them a twisted form vermicular  And o'er the seat with plenteous wadding stuff'd  Induced a splendid cover green and blue  Yellow and red of tapestry richly wrought  And woven close or needlework sublime  There might ye see the pioney spread wide  The fullblown rose the shepherd and his lass  Lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes  And parrots with twin cherries in their beak  Now came the cane from India smooth and bright  With Nature's varnish sever'd into stripes  That interlaced each other these supplied  Of texture firm a lattice work that braced  The new machine and it became a chair  But restless was the chair the back erect  Distress'd the weary loins that felt no ease  The slipp'ry seat betray'd the sliding part  That press'd it and the feet hung dangling down  Anxious in vain to find the distant floor  These for the rich the rest whom fate had placed  In modest mediocrity content  With base materials sat on well tann'd hides  Obdurate and unyielding glassy smooth  With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn  Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixt  If cushion might be call'd what harder seem'd  Than the firm oak of which the frame was form'd  No want of timber then was felt or fear'd  In Albion's happy isle The umber stood  Pond'rous and fixt by its own massy weight  But elbows still were wanting these some say  An Alderman of Cripplegate contrived  And some ascribe the invention to a priest  Burly and big and studious of his ease  But rude at first and not with easy slope  Receding wide they press'd against the ribs  And bruised the side and elevated high  Taught the rais'd shoulders to invade the ears  Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires  Complain'd though incommodiously pent in  And ill at ease behind The Ladies first  'Gan murmur as became the softer sex  Ingenious fancy never better pleas'd  Than when employ'd t' accommodate the fair  Heard the sweet moan with pity and devised  The soft settee one elbow at each end  And in the midst an elbow it receiv'd  United yet divided twain at once  So sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne  And so two citizens who take the air  Close pack'd and smiling in a chaise and one  But relaxation of the languid frame  By soft recumbency of outstretched limbs  Was bliss reserved for happier days So slow  The growth of what is excellent so hard  T'attain perfection in this nether world  Thus first necessity invented stools  Convenience next suggested elbow chairs  And luxury th' accomplished Sofa last  The nurse sleeps sweetly hired to watch the sick  Whom snoring she disturbs As sweetly he  Who quits the coachbox at the midnight hour  To sleep within the carriage more secure  His legs depending at the open door  Sweet sleep enjoys the Curate in his desk  The tedious Rector drawling o'er his head  And sweet the Clerk below but neither sleep  Of lazy Nurse who snores the sick man dead  Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour  To slumber in the carriage more secure  Nor sleep enjoy'd by Curate in his desk  Nor yet the dozings of the Clerk are sweet  Compared with the repose the SOFA yields  Oh may I live exempted while I live  Guiltless of pamper'd appetite obscene  From pangs arthritic that infest the toe  Of libertine excess The SOFA suits  The gouty limb 'tis true but gouty limb  Though on a SOFA may I never feel  For I have loved the rural walk through lanes  Of grassy swarth close cropt by nibbling sheep  And skirted thick with intertexture firm  Of thorny boughs have loved the rural walk  O'er hills through valleys and by rivers brink  E'er since a truant boy I pass'd my bounds  T'enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames  And still remember nor without regret  Of hours that sorrow since has much endear'd  How oft my slice of pocket store consumed  Still hung'ring pennyless and far from home  I fed on scarlet hips and stoney haws  Or blushing crabs or berries that imboss  The bramble black as jet or sloes austere  Hard fare but such as boyish appetite  Disdains not nor the palate undepraved  By culinary arts unsav'ry deems  No SOFA then awaited my return  Nor SOFA then I needed Youth repairs  His wasted spirits quickly by long toil  Incurring short fatigue and though our years  As life declines speed rapidly away  And not a year but pilfers as he goes  Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep  A tooth or auburn lock and by degrees  Their length and color from the locks they spare  Th' elastic spring of an unwearied foot  That mounts the stile with ease or leaps the fence  That play of lungs inhaling and again  Respiring freely the fresh air that makes  Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me  Mine have not pilfer'd yet nor yet impair'd  My relish of fair prospect scenes that sooth'd  Or charm'd me young no longer young I find  Still soothing and of power to charm me still  And witness dear companion of my walks  Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive  Fast lock'd in mine with pleasure such as love  Confirm'd by long experience of thy worth  And welltried virtues could alone inspire  Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long  Thou know'st my praise of nature most sincere  And that my raptures are not conjured up  To serve occasions of poetic pomp  But genuine and art partner of them all  How oft upon yon eminence our pace  Has slacken'd to a pause and we have borne  The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew  While admiration feeding at the eye  And still unsated dwelt upon the scene  Thence with what pleasure have we just discern'd  The distant plough slowmoving and beside  His lab'ring team that swerv'd not from the track  The sturdy swain diminish'd to a boy  Here Ouse slow winding through a level plain  Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er  Conducts the eye along his sinuous course  Delighted There fast rooted in his bank  Stand never overlook'd our fav'rite elms  That screen the herdsman's solitary hut  While far beyond and overthwart the stream  That as with molten glass inlays the vale  The sloping land recedes into the clouds  Displaying on its varied side the grace  Of hedgerow beauties numberless square tow'r  Tall spire from which the sound of chearful bells  Just undulates upon the list'ning ear  Groves heaths and smoking villages remote  Scenes must be beautiful which daily view'd  Please daily and whose novelty survives  Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years  Praise justly due to those that I describe  Nor rural sights alone but rural sounds  Exhilarate the spirit and restore  The tone of languid Nature Mighty winds  That sweep the skirt of some farspreading wood  Of ancient growth make music not unlike  The dash of ocean on his winding shore  And lull the spirit while they fill the mind  Unnumber'd branches waving in the blast  And all their leaves fast flutt'ring all at once  Nor less composure waits upon the roar  Of distant floods or on the softer voice  Of neighb'ring fountain or of rills that slip  Through the cleft rock and chiming as they fall  Upon loose pebbles lose themselves at length  In matted grass that with a livelier green  Betrays the secret of their silent course  Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds  But animated Nature sweeter still  To sooth and satisfy the human ear  Ten thousand warblers chear the day and one  The livelong night nor these alone whose notes  Nicefinger'd art must emulate in vain  But cawing rooks and kites that swim sublime  In still repeated circles screaming loud  The jay the pie and ev'n the boding owl  That hails the rising moon have charms for me  Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh  Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns  And only there please highly for their sake  Peace to the artist whose ingenious thought  Devised the weatherhouse that useful toy  Fearless of humid air and gathering rains  Forth steps the man an emblem of myself  More delicate his tim'rous mate retires  When Winter soaks the fields and female feet  Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay  Or ford the rivulets are best at home  The task of new discov'ries falls on me  At such a season and with such a charge  Once went I forth and found till then unknown  A cottage whither oft we since repair  'Tis perch'd upon the greenhill top but close  Inviron'd with a ring of branching elms  That overhang the thatch itself unseen  Peeps at the vale below so thick beset  With foliage of such dark redundant growth  I call'd the lowroof'd lodge the  peasant's nest  And hidden as it is and far remote  From such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear  In village or in town the bay of curs  Incessant clinking hammers grinding wheels  And infants clam'rous whether pleas'd or pain'd  Oft have I wish'd the peaceful covert mine  Here I have said at least I should possess  The poet's treasure silence and indulge  The dreams of fancy tranquil and secure  Vain thought the dweller in that still retreat  Dearly obtains the refuge it affords  Its elevated scite forbids the wretch  Yo drink sweet waters of the chrystal well  He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch  And heavyladen brings his bev'rage home  Farfetch'd and little worth nor seldom waits  Dependent on the baker's punctual call  To hear his creaking panniers at the door  Angry and sad and his last crust consumed  So farewel envy of the  peasant's nest  If solitude make scant the means of life  Society for me thou seeming sweet  Be still a pleasing object in my view  My visit still but never mine abode  Not distant far a length of colonade  Invites us Monument of ancient taste  Now scorn'd but worthy of a better fate  Our fathers knew the value of a screen  From sultry suns and in their shaded walks  And longprotracted bow'rs enjoy'd at noon  The gloom and coolness of declining day  We bear our shades about us self depriv'd  Of other screen the thin umbrella spread  And range an Indian waste without a tree  Thanks to  John Courtney Throckmorton Esq of Weston Underwood  Benevolushe spares me yet  These chesnuts ranged in corresponding lines  And though himself so polish'd still reprieves  The obsolete prolixity of shade  Descending now but cautious lest too fast  A sudden steep upon a rustic bridge  We pass a gulph in which the willows dip  Their pendent boughs stooping as if to drink  Hence ancle deep in moss and flow'ry thyme  We mount again and feel at ev'ry step  Our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft  Rais'd by the mole the miner of the soil  He not unlike the great ones of mankind  Disfigures earth and plotting in the dark  Toils much to earn a monumental pile  That may record the mischiefs he has done  The summit gain'd behold the proud alcove  That crowns it yet not all its pride secures  The grand retreat from injuries impress'd  By rural carvers who with knives deface  The pannels leaving an obscure rude name  In characters uncouth and spelt amiss  So strong the zeal t' immortalize himself  Beats in the breast of man that ev'n a few  Few transient years won from th' abyss abhorr'd  Of blank oblivion seem a glorious prize  And even to a clown Now roves the eye  And posted on this speculative height  Exults in its command The sheepfold here  Pours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe  At first progressive as a stream they seek  The middle field but scatter'd by degrees  Each to his choice soon whiten all the land  There from the sunburnt hayfield homeward creeps  The loaded wain while lighten'd of its charge  The wain that meets it passes swiftly by  The boorish driver leaning o'er his team  Vocif'rous and impatient of delay  Nor less attractive is the woodland scene  Diversified with trees of ev'ry growth  Alike yet various Here the grey smooth trunks  Of ash or lime or beech distinctly shine  Within the twilight of their distant shades  There lost behind a rising ground the wood  Seems sunk and shorten'd to its topmost boughs  No tree in all the grove but has its charms  Though each its hue peculiar paler some  And of a wannish grey the willow such  And poplar that with silver lines his leaf  And ash farstretching his umbrageous arm  Of deeper green the elm and deeper still  Lord of the woods the longsurviving oak  Some glossyleav'd and shining in the sun  The maple and the beech of oily nuts  Prolific and the lime at dewy eve  Diffusing odors nor unnoted pass  The sycamore capricious in attire  Now green now tawny and 'ere autumn yet  Have changed the woods in scarlet honors bright  O'er these but far beyond a spacious map  Of hill and valley interpos'd between  The Ouse dividing the well water'd land  Now glitters in the sun and now retires  As bashful yet impatient to be seen  Hence the declivity is sharp and short  And such the reascent between them weeps  A little Naiad her impov'rish'd urn  All summer long which winter fills again  The folded gates would bar my progress now  But that the  See the foregoing note  Lord of this inclosed demesne  Communicative of the good he owns  Admits me to a share the guiltless eye  Commits no wrong nor wastes what it enjoys  Refreshing change where now the blazing sun  By short transition we have lost his glare  And stepp'd at once into a cooler clime  Ye fallen avenues once more I mourn  Your fate unmerited once more rejoice  That yet a remnant of your race survives  How airy and how light the graceful arch  Yet awful as the consecrated roof  Reechoing pious anthems while beneath  The chequer'd earth seems restless as a flood  Brush'd by the wind So sportive is the light  Shot through the boughs it dances as they dance  Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick  And darkning and enlightning as the leaves  Play wanton ev'ry moment ev'ry spot  And now with nerves newbrac'd and spirits chear'd  We tread the wilderness whose wellroll'd walks  With curvature of slow and easy sweep  Deception innocentgive ample space  To narrow bounds The grove receives us next  Between the upright shafts of whose tall elms  We may discern the thresher at his task  Thump after thump resounds the constant flail  That seems to swing uncertain and yet falls  Full on the destin'd ear Wide flies the chaff  The rustling straw sends up a frequent mist  Of atoms sparkling in the noonday beam  Come hither ye that press your beds of down  And sleep not see him sweating o'er his bread  Before he eats it'Tis the primal curse  But soften'd into mercy made the pledge  Of chearful days and nights without a groan  By ceaseless action all that is subsists  Constant rotation of th' unwearied wheel  That nature rides upon maintains her health  Her beauty her fertility She dreads  An instant's pause and lives but while she moves  Its own revolvency upholds the world  Winds from all quarters agitate the air  And fit the limpid element for use  Else noxious oceans rivers lakes and streams  All feel the fresh'ning impulse and are cleansed  By restless undulation ev'n the oak  Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm  He seems indeed indignant and to feel  Th' impression of the blast with proud disdain  Frowning as if in his unconscious arm  He held the thunder But the monarch owes  His firm stability to what he scorns  More fixt below the more disturb'd above  The law by which all creatures else are bound  Binds man the lord of all Himself derives  No mean advantage from a kindred cause  From strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease  The sedentary stretch their lazy length  When custom bids but no refreshment find  For none they need the languid eye the cheek  Deserted of its bloom the flaccid shrunk  And wither'd muscle and the vapid soul  Reproach their owner with that love of rest  To which he forfeits ev'n the rest he loves  Not such th' alert and active Measure life  By its true worth the comforts it affords  And theirs alone seems worthy of the name  Good health and its associate in the most  Good temper spirits prompt to undertake  And not soon spent though in an arduous task  The pow'rs of fancy and strong thought are theirs  Ev'n age itself seems privileged in them  With clear exemption from its own defects  A sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front  The vet'ran shows and gracing a grey beard  With youthful smiles descends toward the grave  Sprightly and old almost without decay  Like a coy maiden ease when courted most  Farthest retiresan idol at whose shrine  Who oft'nest sacrifice are favor'd least  The love of Nature and the scenes she draws  Is Nature's dictate Strange there should be found  Who selfimprison'd in their proud saloons  Renounce the odors of the open field  For the unscented fictions of the loom  Who satisfied with only pencil'd scenes  Prefer to the performance of a God  Th' inferior wonders of an artist's hand  Lovely indeed the mimic works of art  But Nature's works far lovelier I admire  None more admires the painter's magic skill  Who shews me that which I shall never see  Conveys a distant country into mine  And throws Italian light on English walls  But imitative strokes can do no more  Than please the eye sweet Nature ev'ry sense  The air salubrious of her lofty hills  The chearing fragrance of her dewy vales  And music of her woodsno works of man  May rival these these all bespeak a power  Peculiar and exclusively her own  Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast  'Tis free to all'tis ev'ry day renew'd  Who scorns it starves deservedly at home  He does not scorn it who imprison'd long  In some unwholesome dungeon and a prey  To sallow sickness which the vapors dank  And clammy of his dark abode have bred  Escapes at last to liberty and light  His cheek recovers soon its healthful hue  His eye relumines its extinguish'd fires  He walks he leaps he runsis wing'd with joy  And riots in the sweets of ev'ry breeze  He does not scorn it who has long endur'd  A fever's agonies and fed on drugs  Nor yet the mariner his blood inflamed  With acrid salts his very heart athirst  To gaze at Nature in her green array  Upon the ship's tall side he stands possess'd  With visions prompted by intense desire  Fair fields appear below such as he left  Far distant such as he would die to find  He seeks them headlong and is seen no more  The spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns  The low'ring eye the petulance the frown  And sullen sadness that o'ershade distort  And mar the face of beauty when no cause  For such immeasurable woe appears  These Flora banishes and gives the fair  Sweet smiles and bloom less transient than her own  It is the constant revolution stale  And tasteless of the same repeated joys  That palls and satiates and makes languid life  A pedlar's pack that bows the bearer down  Health suffers and the spirits ebb the heart  Recoils from its own choiceat the full feast  Is famish'dfinds no music in the song  No smartness in the jest and wonders why  Yet thousands still desire to journey on  Though halt and weary of the path they tread  The paralitic who can hold her cards  But cannot play them borrows a friend's hand  To deal and shuffle to divide and sort  Her mingled suits and sequences and sits  Spectatress both and spectacle a sad  And silent cypher while her proxy plays  Others are dragg'd into the crowded room  Between supporters and once seated sit  Through downright inability to rise  'Till the stout bearers lift the corpse again  These speak a loud memento Yet ev'n these  Themselves love life and cling to it as he  That overhangs a torrent to a twig  They love it and yet loath it fear to die  Yet scorn the purposes for which they live  Then wherefore not renounce them Nothe dread  The slavish dread of solitude that breeds  Reflection and remorse the fear of shame  And their invet'rate habits all forbid  Whom call we gay That honor has been long  The boast of mere pretenders to the name  The innocent are gaythe lark is gay  That dries his feathers saturate with dew  Beneath the rosy cloud while yet the beams  Of dayspring overshoot his humble nest  The peasant too a witness of his song  Himself a songster is as gay as he  But save me from the gaiety of those  Whose headaches nail them to a noonday bed  And save me too from theirs whose haggard eyes  Flash desperation and betray their pangs  For property stripp'd off by cruel chance  From gaiety that fills the bones with pain  The mouth with blasphemy the heart with woe  The earth was made so various that the mind  Of desultory man studious of change  And pleas'd with novelty might be indulged  Prospects however lovely may be seen  'Till half their beauties fade the weary sight  Too well acquainted with their smiles slides off  Fastidious seeking less familiar scenes  Then snug inclosures in the shelter'd vale  Where frequent hedges intercept the eye  Delight us happy to renounce a while  Not senseless of its charms what still we love  That such short absence may endear it more  Then forests or the savage rock may please  That hides the seamew in his hollow clefts  Above the reach of man his hoary head  Conspicuous many a league the mariner  Bound homeward and in hope already there  Greets with three cheers exulting At his waist  A girdle of halfwither'd shrubs he shows  And at his feet the baffled billows die  The common overgrown with fern and rough  With prickly goss that shapeless and deform  And dang'rous to the touch has yet its bloom  And decks itself with ornaments of gold  Yields no unpleasing ramble there the turf  Smells fresh and rich in odorif'rous herbs  And fungous fruits of earth regales the sense  With luxury of unexpected sweets  There often wanders one whom better days  Saw better clad in cloak of sattin trimm'd  With lace and hat with splendid ribband bound  A serving maid was she and fell in love  With one who left her went to sea and died  Her fancy followed him through foaming waves  To distant shores and she would sit and weep  At what a sailor suffers fancy too  Delusive most where warmest wishes are  Would oft anticipate his glad return  And dream of transports she was not to know  She heard the doleful tidings of his death  And never smil'd again And now she roams  The dreary waste there spends the livelong day  And there unless when charity forbids  The livelong night A tatter'd apron hides  Worn as a cloak and hardly hides a gown  More tatter'd still and both but ill conceal  A bosom heaved with neverceasing sighs  She begs an idle pin of all she meets  And hoards them in her sleeve but needful food  Though press'd with hunger oft or comelier cloaths  Though pinch'd with cold asks neverKate is craz'd  I see a column of slowrising smoke  O'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild  A vagabond and useless tribe there eat  Their miserable meal A kettle slung  Between two poles upon a stick transverse  Receives the morsel flesh obscene of dog  Or vermin or at best of cock purloin'd  From his accustom'd perch Hardfaring race  They pick their fuel out of ev'ry hedge  Which kindled with dry leaves just saves unquench'd  The spark of life The sportive wind blows wide  Their flutt'ring rags and shows a tawny skin  The vellum of the pedigree they claim  Great skill have they in palmistry and more  To conjure clean away the gold they touch  Conveying worthless dross into its place  Loud when they beg dumb only when they steal  Strange that a creature rational and cast  In human mould should brutalize by choice  His nature and though capable of arts  By which the world might profit and himself  Selfbanish'd from fociety prefer  Such squalid sloth to honorable toil  Yet even these though feigning sickness oft  They swathe the forehead drag the limping limb  And vex their flesh with artificial sores  Can change their whine into a mirthful note  When safe occasion offers and with dance  And music of the bladder and the bag  Beguile their woes and make the woods resound  Such health and gaiety of heart enjoy  The houseless rovers of the sylvan world  And breathing wholesome air and wand'ring much  Need other physic none to heal th' effects  Of loathfome diet penury and cold  Blest he though undistinguish'd from the crowd  By wealth or dignity who dwells secure  Where man by nature fierce has laid aside  His fierceness having learnt though slow to learn  The manners and the arts of civil life  His wants indeed are many but supply  Is obvious placed within the easy reach  Of temp'rate wishes and industrious hands  Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil  Not rude and surly and beset with thorns  And terrible to sight as when she springs  If e'er she spring spontaneous in remote  And barb'rous climes where violence prevails  And strength is lord of all but gentle kind  By culture tam'd by liberty refresh'd  And all her fruits by radiant truth matur'd  War and the chace engross the savage whole  War follow'd for revenge or to supplant  The envied tenants of some happier spot  The chace for sustenance precarious trust  His hard condition with severe constraint  Binds all his faculties forbids all growth  Of wisdom proves a school in which he learns  Sly circumvention unrelenting hate  Mean selfattachment and scarce aught beside  Thus fare the shiv'ring natives of the north  And thus the rangers of the western world  Where it advances far into the deep  Towards th' Antarctic Ev'n the favor'd isles  So lately found although the constant sun  Cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile  Can boast but little virtue and inert  Through plenty lose in morals what they gain  In manners victims of luxurious ease  These therefore I can pity placed remote  From all that science traces art invents  Or inspiration teaches and inclosed  In boundless oceans never to be pass'd  By navigators uninformed as they  Or plough'd perhaps by British bark again  But far beyond the rest and with most cause  Thee gentle  Omia  savage whom no love of thee  Or thine but curiosity perhaps  Or else vain glory prompted us to draw  Forth from thy native bow'rs to show thee here  With what superior skill we can abuse  The gifts of providence and squander life  The dream is past And thou hast found again  Thy cocoas and bananas palms and yams  And homestall thatch'd with leaves But hast thou found  Their former charms And having seen our state  Our palaces our ladies and our pomp  Of equipage our gardens and our sports  And heard our music are thy simple friends  Thy simple fare and all thy plain delights  As dear to thee as once And have thy joys  Lost nothing by comparison with ours  Rude as thou art for we return'd thee rude  And ignorant except of outward show  I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart  And spiritless as never to regret  Sweets tasted here and left as soon as known  Methinks I see thee straying on the beach  And asking of the surge that bathes thy foot  If ever it has wash'd our distant shore  I see thee weep and thine are honest tears  A patriot's for his country Thou art sad  At thought of her forlorn and abject state  From which no power of thine can raise her up  Thus fancy paints thee and though apt to err  Perhaps errs little when she paints thee thus  She tells me too that duely ev'ry morn  Thou climb'st the mountain top with eager eye  Exploring far and wide the wat'ry waste  For sight of ship from England Ev'ry speck  Seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale  With conflict of contending hopes and fears  But comes at last the dull and dusky eve  And sends thee to thy cabbin wellprepar'd  To dream all night of what the day denied  Alas expect it not We found no bait  To tempt us in thy country Doing good  Disinterested good is not our trade  We travel far 'tis true but not for nought  And must be brib'd to compass earth again  By other hopes and richer fruits than yours  But though true worth and virtue in the mild  And genial soil of cultivated life  Thrive most and may perhaps thrive only there  Yet not in cities oft In proud and gay  And gain devoted cities thither flow  As to a common and most noisome sewer  The dregs and faeculence of ev'ry land  In cities foul example on most minds  Begets its likeness Rank abundance breeds  In gross and pamper'd cities sloth and lust  And wantonness and gluttonous excess  In cities vice is hidden with most ease  Or seen with least reproach and virtue taught  By frequent lapse can hope no triumph there  Beyond th' atchievement of successful flight  I do confess them nurs'ries of the arts  In which they flourish most Where in the beams  Of warm encouragement and in the eye  Of public note they reach their perfect size  Such London is by taste and wealth proclaim'd  The fairest capital of all the world  By riot and incontinence the worst  There touch'd by Reynolds a dull blank becomes  A lucid mirror in which nature sees  All her reflected features Bacon there  Gives more than female beauty to a stone  And Chatham's eloquence to marble lips  Nor does the chissel occupy alone  The pow'rs of sculpture but the style as much  Each province of her art her equal care  With nice incision of her guided steel  She ploughs a brazen field and clothes a soil  So sterile with what charms soe'er she will  The richest scen'ry and the loveliest forms  Where finds philosophy her eagle eye  With which she gazes at yon burning disk  Undazzled and detects and counts his spots  In London where her implements exact  With which she calculates computes and scans  All distance motion magnitude and now  Measures an atom and now girds a world  In London where has commerce such a mart  So rich so throng'd so drain'd and so supplied  As London opulent enlarged and still  Increasing London Babylon of old  Not more the glory of the earth than she  A more accomplish'd world's chief glory now  She has her praise Now mark a spot or two  That so much beauty would do well to purge  And show this queen of cities that so fair  May yet be foul so witty yet not wise  It is not seemly nor of good report  That she is slack in discipline More prompt  T'avenge than to prevent the breach of law  That she is rigid in denouncing death  On petty robbers and indulges life  And liberty and ofttimes honor too  To peculators of the public gold  That thieves at home must hang but he that puts  Into his overgorged and bloated purse  The wealth of Indian provinces escapes  Nor is it well nor can it come to good  That through profane and infidel contempt  Of holy writ she has presum'd t'annul  And

want of discipline in the Universities  BOOK II  THE TIMEPIECE  OH for a lodge in some vast wilderness  Some boundless continguity of shade  Where rumour of oppression and deceit  Of unsuccessful or successful war  Might never reach me more My ear is pain'd  My soul is sick with ev'ry day's report  Of wrong and outrage with which earth is fill'd  There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart  It does not feel for man The nat'ral bond  Of brotherhood is sever'd as the flax  That falls asunder at the touch of fire  He finds his fellow guilty of a skin  Not colour'd like his own and having pow'r  T' inforce the wrong sor such a worthy cause  Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey  Lands intersected by a narrow frith  Abhor each other Mountains interposed  Make enemies of nations who had else  Like kindred drops been mingled into one  Thus man devotes his brother and destroys  And worse than all and most to be deplored  As human nature's broadest foulest blot  Chains him and tasks him and exacts his sweat  With stripes that mercy with a bleeding heart  Weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast  Then what is man And what man seeing this  And having human feelings does not blush  And hang his head to think himself a man  I would not have a slave to till my ground  To carry me to fan me while I sleep  And tremble when I wake for all the wealth  That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd  No dear as freedom is and in my heart's  Just estimation priz'd above all price  I had much rather be myself the slave  And wear the bonds than fasten them on him  We have no slaves at homeThen why abroad  And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave  That parts us are emancipate and loos'd  Slaves cannot breathe in England if their lungs  Receive our air that moment they are free  They touch our country and their shackles fall  That's noble and bespeaks a nation proud  And jealous of the blessing Spread it then  And let it circulate through ev'ry vein  Of all your empire That where Britain's power  Is felt mankind may feel her mercy too  Sure there is need of social intercourse  Benevolence and peace and mutual aid  Between the nations in a world that seems  To toll the deathbell of its own decease  And by the voice of all its elements  To preach the gen'ral doom  Alluding to the late calamities at Jamaica  When were the winds  Let slip with such a warrant to destroy  When did the waves so haughtily o'erleap  Their ancient barriers deluging the dry  Fires from beneath and meteors  August  from above  Portentous unexampled unexplained  Have kindled beacons in the skies and th' old  And crazy earth has had her shaking fits  More frequent and foregone her usual rest  Is it a time to wrangle when the props  And pillars of our planet seem to fail  And Nature  Alluding to the fog that covered both Europe and Asia during the whole summer of  with a dim and sickly eye  To wait the close of all But grant her end  More distant and that prophecy demands  A longer respite unaccomplished yet  Still they are frowning signals and bespeak  Displeasure in his breast who smites the earth  Or heals it makes it languish or rejoice  And 'tis but seemly that where all deserve  And stand exposed by common peccancy  To what no few have felt there should be peace  And brethren in calamity should love  Alas for Sicily rude fragments now  Lie scatter'd where the shapely column stood  Her palaces are dust In all her streets  The voice of singing and the sprightly chord  Are silent Revelry and dance and show  Suffer a syncope and solemn pause  While God performs upon the trembling stage  Of his own works his dreadful part alone  How does the earth receive himWith what signs  Of gratulation and delight her king  Pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad  Her sweetest flow'rs her aromatic gums  Disclosing paradise where'er he treads  She quakes at his approach Her hollow womb  Conceiving thunders through a thousand deeps  And fiery caverns roars beneath his foot  The hills move lightly and the mountains smoke  For he has touch'd them From th' extremest point  Of elevation down into th' abyss  His wrath is busy and his frown is felt  The rocks fall headlong and the vallies rise  The rivers die into offensive pools  And charged with putrid verdure breathe a gross  And mortal nuisance into all the air  What solid was by transformation strange  Grows fluid and the fixt and rooted earth  Tormented into billows heaves and swells  Or with vortiginous and hideous whirl  Sucks down its prey insatiable Immense  The tumult and the overthrow the pangs  And agonies of human and of brute  Multitudes fugitive on ev'ry side  And fugitive in vain The sylvan scene  Migrates uplifted and with all its soil  Alighting in far distant fields finds out  A new possessor and survives the change  Ocean has caught the frenzy and upwrought  To an enormous and o'erbearing height  Not by a mighty wind but by that voice  Which winds and waves obey invades the shore  Resistless Never such a sudden flood  Upridged so high and sent on such a charge  Possess'd an inland scene Where now the throng  That press'd the beach and hasty to depart  Look'd to the sea for safety They are gone  Gone with the refluent wave into the deep  A prince with half his people Ancient tow'rs  And roofs embattled high the gloomy scenes  Where beauty oft and letter'd worth consume  Life in the unproductive shades of death  Fall prone the pale inhabitants come forth  And happy in their unforeseen release  From all the rigors of restraint enjoy  The terrors of the day that sets them free  Who then that has thee would not hold thee fast  Freedom whom they that lose thee so regret  That ev'n a judgment making way for thee  Seems in their eyes a mercy for thy sake  Such evil sin hath wrought and such a flame  Kindled in heaven that it burns down to earth  And in the furious inquest that it makes  On God's behalf lays waste his fairest works  The very elements though each be meant  The minister of man to serve his wants  Conspire against him With his breath he draws  A plague into his blood And cannot use  Life's necessary means but he must die  Storms rise t' o'erwhelm him or if stormy winds  Rise not the waters of the deep shall rise  And needing none assistance of the storm  Shall roll themselves ashore and reach him there  The earth shall shake him out of all his holds  Or make his house his grave Nor so content  Shall counterfeit the motions of the flood  And drown him in her dry and dusty gulphs  What thenwere they the wicked above all  And we the righteous whose fastanchor'd isle  Moved not while their's was rock'd like a light skiff  The sport of ev'ry wave No none are clear  And none than we more guilty But where all  Stand chargeable with guilt and to the shafts  Of wrath obnoxious God may chuse his mark  May punish if he please the less to warn  The more malignant If he spar'd not them  Tremble and be amazed at thine escape  Far guiltier England lest he spare not thee  Happy the man who sees a God employed  In all the good and ill that checquer life  Resolving all events with their effects  And manifold results into the will  And arbitration wise of the Supreme  Did not his eye rule all things and intend  The least of our concerns since from the least  The greatest oft originate could chance  Find place in his dominion or dispose  One lawless particle to thwart his plan  Then God might be surprized and unforeseen  Contingence might alarm him and disturb  The smooth and equal course of his affairs  This truth philosophy though eagleeyed  In nature's tendencies oft overlooks  And having found his instrument forgets  Or disregards or more presumptuous still  Denies the pow'r that wields it God proclaims  His hot displeasure against foolish men  That live an atheist life Involves the heav'n  In tempests quits his grasp upon the winds  And gives them all their fury Bids a plague  Kindle a fiery boil upon the skin  And putrify the breath of blooming health  He calls for famine and the meagre fiend  Blows mildew from between his shrivel'd lips  And taints the golden ear He springs his mines  And desolates a nation at a blast  Forth steps the spruce philosopher and tells  Of homogeneal and discordant springs  And principles of causes how they work  By necessary laws their sure effects  Of action and reaction He has found  The source of the disease that nature feels  And bids the world take heart and banish fear  Thou fool will thy discov'ry of the cause  Suspend th' effect or heal it Has not God  Still wrought by means since first he made the world  And did he not of old employ his means  To drown it What is his creation less  Than a capacious reservoir of means  Form'd for his use and ready at his will  Go dress thine eyes with eyesalve ask of him  Or ask of whomsoever he has taught  And learn though late the genuine cause of all  England with all thy faults I love thee still  My country and while yet a nook is left  Where English minds and manners may be found  Shall be constrain'd to love thee Though thy clime  Be fickle and thy year most part deform'd  With dripping rains or wither'd by a frost  I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies  And fields without a flower for warmer France  With all her vines nor for Ausonias groves  Of golden fruitage and her myrtle bow'rs  To shake thy senate and from heights sublime  Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire  Upon thy foes was never meant my task  But I can feel thy fortunes and partake  Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart  As any thund'rer there And I can feel  Thy follies too and with a just disdain  Frown at effeminates whose very looks  Reflect dishonor on the land I love  How in the name of soldiership and sense  Should England prosper when such things as smooth  And tender as a girl all essenced o'er  With odors and as profligate as sweet  Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath  And love when they should fight when such as these  Presume to lay their hand upon the ark  Of her magnificent and awful cause  Time was when it was praise and boast enough  In ev'ry clime and travel where we might  That we were born her children Praise enough  To fill th' ambition of a private man  That Chatham's language was his mother tongue  And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own  Farewell those honors and farewell with them  The hope of such hereafter They have fall'n  Each in his field of glory One in arms  And one in council Wolfe upon the lap  Of smiling victory that moment won  And Chatham heartsick of his country's shame  They made us many soldiers Chatham still  Consulting England's happiness at home  Secured it by an unforgiving frown  If any wrong'd her Wolf where'er he fought  Put so much of his heart into his act  That his example had a magnet's force  And all were swift to follow whom all loved  Those suns are set Oh rise some other such  Or all that we have left is empty talk  Of old atchievements and despair of new  Now hoist the sail and let the streamers float  Upon the wanton breezes Strew the deck  With lavender and sprinkle liquid sweets  That no rude savour maritime invade  The nose of nice nobility Breathe soft  Ye clarionets and softer still ye flutes  That winds and waters lull'd by magic sounds  May bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore  True we have lost an empirelet it pass  True we may thank the perfidy of France  That pick'd the jewel out of England's crown  With all the cunning of an envious shrew  And let that pass'twas but a trick of state  A brave man knows no malice but at once  Forgets in peace the injuries of war  And gives his direst foe a friend's embrace  And shamed as we have been to th' very beard  Braved and defied and in our own sea proved  Too weak for those decisive blows that once  Insured us mast'ry there we yet retain  Some small preeminence we justly boast  At least superior jockeyship and claim  The honors of the turf as all our own  Go then well worthy of the praise ye seek  And show the shame ye might conceal at home  In foreign eyesbe grooms and win the plate  Where once your nobler fathers won a crown  'Tis gen'rous to communicate your skill  To those that need it Folly is soon learn'd  And under such preceptors who can fail  There is a pleasure in poetic pains  Which only poets know The shifts and turns  Th' expedients and inventions multiform  To which the mind resorts in chace of terms  Though apt yet coy and difficult to win  T' arrest the fleeting images that fill  The mirror of the mind and hold them fast  And force them sit 'till he has pencil'd off  A faithful likeness of the forms he views  Then to dispofe his copies with such art  That each may find its most propitious light  And shine by situation hardly less  Than by the labor and the skill it cost  Are occupations of the poet's mind  So pleasing and that steal away the thought  With such address from themes of sad import  That lost in his own musings happy man  He feels th' anxieties of life denied  Their wonted entertainment all retire  Such joys has he that sings But ah not such  Or seldom such the hearers of his song  Fastidious or else listless or perhaps  Aware of nothing arduous in a task  They never undertook they little note  His dangers or escapes and haply find  There least amusement where he found the most  But is amusement all studious of song  And yet ambitious not to sing in vain  I would not trifle merely though the world  Be loudest in their praise who do no more  Yet what can satire whether grave or gay  It may correct a foible may chastise  The freaks of fashion regulate the dress  Retrench a swordblade or displace a patch  But where are its sublimer trophies found  What vice has it subdued whose heart reclaim'd  By rigour or whom laugh'd into reform  Alas Leviathan is not so tamed  Laugh'd at he laughs again and stricken hard  Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales  That fear no discipline of human hands  The pulpit therefore and I name it fill'd  With solemn awe that bids me well beware  With what intent I touch that holy thing  The pulpit when the sat'rist has at last  Strutting and vap'ring in an empty school  Spent all his force and made no proselyte  I say the pulpit in the sober use  Of its legitimate peculiar pow'rs  Must stand acknowledg'd while the world shall stand  The most important and effectual guard  Support and ornament of virtue's cause  There stands the messenger of truth There stands  The legate of the skies His theme divine  His office sacred his credentials clear  By him the violated law speaks out  Its thunders and by him in strains as sweet  As angels use the gospel whispers peace  He stablishes the strong restores the weak  Reclaims the wand'rer binds the broken heart  And arm'd himself in panoply complete  Of heav'nly temper furnishes with arms  Bright as his own and trains by ev'ry rule  Of holy discipline to glorious war  The sacramental host of God's elect  Are all such teachers would to heav'n all were  But harkthe Doctor's voicefast wedg'd between  Two empirics he stands and with swoln cheeks  Inspires the news his trumpet Keener far  Than all invective is his bold harrangue  While through that public organ of report  He hails the clergy and defying shame  Announces to the world his own and theirs  He teaches those to read whom schools dismiss'd  And colleges untaught sells accent tone  And emphasis in score and gives to pray'r  Th'  adagio  and  andante  it demands  He grinds divinity of other days  Down into modern use transforms old print  To zigzag manuscript and cheats the eyes  Of gall'ry critics by a thousand arts  Are there who purchase of the Doctor's ware  Oh name it not in Gathit cannot be  That grave and learned Clerks should need such aid  He doubtless is in sport and does but droll  Assuming thus a rank unknown before  Grand caterer and drynurse of the church  I venerate the man whose heart is warm  Whose hands are pure whose doctrine and whose life  Coincident exhibit lucid proof  That he is honest in the sacred cause  To such I render more than mere respect  Whose actions say that they respect themselves  But loose in morals and in manners vain  In conversation frivolous in dress  Extreme at once rapacious and profuse  Frequent in park with lady at his side  Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes  But rare at home and never at his books  Or with his pen save when he scrawls a card  Constant at routs familiar with a round  Of ladyships a stranger to the poor  Ambitious of preferment for its gold  And well prepared by ignorance and sloth  By infidelity and love o' th' world  To make God's work a sinecure a slave  To his own pleasures and his patron's pride  From such apostles Oh ye mitred heads  Preserve the church and lay not careless hands  On sculls that cannot teach and will not learn  Would I describe a preacher such as Paul  Were he on earth would hear approve and own  Paul should himself direct me I would trace  His masterstrokes and draw from his design  I would express him simple grave sincere  In doctrine uncorrupt in language plain  And plain in manner Decent solemn chaste  And natural in gesture Much impress'd  Himself as conscious of his awful charge  And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds  May feel it too Affectionate in look  And tender in address as well becomes  A messenger of grace to guilty men  Behold the pictureIs it likeLike whom  The things that mount the rostrum with a skip  And then skip down again Pronounce a text  Cry hem and reading what they never wrote  Just fifteen minutes huddle up their work  And with a well bred whisper close the scene  In man or woman but far most in man  And most of all in man that ministers  And serves the altar in my soul I loath  All affectation 'Tis my perfect scorn  Object of my implacable disgust  Whatwill a man play tricks will he indulge  A silly fond conceit of his fair form  And just proportion fashionable mien  And pretty face in presence of his God  Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes  As with the di'mond on his lily hand  And play his brilliant parts before my eyes  When I am hungry for the bread of life  He mocks his Maker prostitutes and shames  His noble office and instead of truth  Displaying his own beauty starves his flock  Therefore avaunt all attitude and stare  And start theatric practised at the glass  I seek divine simplicity in him  Who handles things divine and all beside  Though learn'd with labor and though much admir'd  By curious eyes and judgments illinform'd  To me is odious as the nasal twang  At conventicle heard where worthy men  Misled by custom strain celestial themes  Through the prest nostril spectaclebestrid  Some decent in demeanor while they preach  That task perform'd relapse into themselves  And having spoken wisely at the close  Grow wanton and give proof to ev'ry eye  Whoe'er was edified themselves were not  Forth comes the pocket mirror First we stroke  An eyebrow next compose a straggling lock  Then with an air most gracefully perform'd  Fall back into our seat extend an arm  And lay it at its ease with gentle care  With handkerchief in hand depending low  The better hand more busy gives the nose  Its bergamot or aids th' indebted eye  With op'ra glass to watch the moving scene  And recognize the slowretiring fair  Now this is fulsome and offends me more  Than in a churchman slovenly neglect  And rustic coarseness would An heav'nly mind  May be indiff'rent to her house of clay  And slight the hovel as beneath her care  But how a body so fantastic trim  And queint in its deportment and attire  Can lodge an heav'nly minddemands a doubt  He that negotiates between God and man  As God's ambassador the grand concerns  Of judgment and of mercy should beware  Of lightness in his speech 'Tis pitiful  To court a grin when you should wooe a soul  To break a jest when pity would inspire  Pathetic exhortation and t' address  The skittish fancy with facetious tales  When sent with God's commission to the heart  So did not Paul Direct me to a quip  Or merry turn in all he ever wrote  And I consent you take it for your text  Your only one till sides and benches fail  No he was serious in a serious cause  And understood too well the weighty terms  That he had ta'en in charge He would not stoop  To conquer those by jocular exploits  Whom truth and soberness assail'd in vain  Oh popular applause what heart of man  Is proof against thy sweet seducing charms  The wisest and the best feel urgent need  Of all their caution in thy gentlest gales  But swell'd into a gustwho then alas  With all his canvass set and inexpert  And therefore heedless can withstand thy power  Praise from the rivel'd lips of toothless bald  Decrepitude and in the looks of lean  And craving poverty and in the bow  Respectful of the smutch'd artificer  Is oft too welcome and may much disturb  The bias of the purpose How much more  Pour'd forth by beauty splendid and polite  In language soft as adoration breathes  Ah spare your idol think him human still  Charms he may have but he has frailties too  Doat not too much nor spoil what ye admire  All truth is from the sempiternal source  Of light divine But Egypt Greece and Rome  Drew from the stream below More favor'd we  Drink when we chuse it at the fountain head  To them it flow'd much mingled and defiled  With hurtful error prejudice and dreams  Illusive of philosophy so call'd  But falsely Sages after sages strove  In vain to filter off a chrystal draught  Pure from the lees which often more enhanced  The thirst than slaked it and not seldom bred  Intoxication and delirium wild  In vain they push'd enquiry to the birth  And springtime of the world ask'd whence is man  Why form'd at all And wherefore as he is  Where must he find his Maker With what rites  Adore him Will he hear accept and bless  Or does he sit regardless of his works  Has man within him an immortal seed  Or does the tomb take all If he survive  His ashes where and in what weal or woe  Knots worthy of solution which alone  A Deity could solve Their answers vague  And all at random fabulous and dark  Left them as dark themselves Their rules of life  Defective and unsanction'd proved too weak  To bind the roving appetite and lead  Blind nature to a God not yet reveal'd  'Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts  Explains all mysteries except her own  And so illuminates the path of life  That fools discover it and stray no more  Now tell me dignified and sapient sir  My man of morals nurtur'd in the shades  Of Academus is this false or true  Is Christ the abler teacher or the schools  If Christ then why resort at ev'ry turn  To Athens or to Rome for wisdom short  Of man's occasions when in him reside  Grace knowledge comfort an unfathom'd store  How oft when Paul has serv'd us with a text  Has Epictetus Plato Tully preach'd  Men that if now alive would sit content  And humble learners of a Saviour's worth  Preach it who might Such was their love of truth  Their thirst of knowledge and their candour too  And thus it is The pastor either vain  By nature or by flatt'ry made so taught  To gaze at his own splendor and t' exalt  Absurdly not his office but himself  Or unenlighten'd and too proud to learn  Or vicious and not therefore apt to teach  Perverting often by the stress of lewd  And loose example whom he should instruct  Exposes and holds up to broad disgrace  The noblest function and discredits much  The brightest truths that man has ever seen  For ghostly counsel if it either fall  Below the exigence or be not back'd  With show of love at least with hopeful proof  Of some sincerity on the giver's part  Or be dishonor'd in th' exterior form  And mode of its conveyance by such tricks  As move derision or by foppish airs  And histrionic mumm'ry that let down  The pulpit to the level of the stage  Drops from the lips a disregarded thing  The weak perhaps are moved but are not taught  While prejudice in men of stronger minds  Takes deeper root confirm'd by what they see  A relaxation of religions hold  Upon the roving and untutor'd heart  Soon follows and the curb of conscience snapt  The laity run wildBut do they now  Note their extravagance and be convinced  As nations ignorant of God contrive  A wooden one so we no longer taught  By monitors that mother church supplies  Now make our own Posterity will ask  If e'er posterity see verse of mine  Some fifty or an hundred lustrums hence  What was a monitor in George's days  My very gentle reader yet unborn  Of whom I needs must augur better things  Since heav'n would sure grow weary of a world  Productive only of a race like us  A monitor is wood Plank shaven thin  We wear it at our backs There closely braced  And neatly fitted it compresses hard  The prominent and most unsightly bones  And binds the shoulders flat We prove its use  Sov'reign and most effectual to secure  A form not now gymnastic as of yore  From rickets and distortion else our lot  But thus admonish'd we can walk erect  One proof at least of manhood while the friend  Sticks close a Mentor worthy of his charge  Our habits costlier than Lucullus wore  And by caprice as multiplied as his  Just please us while the fashion is at full  But change with ev'ry moon The sycophant  That waits to dress us arbitrates their date  Surveys his fair reversion with keen eye  Finds one ill made another obsolete  This fits not nicely that is ill conceived  And making prize of all that he condemns  With our expenditure defrays his own  Variety's the very spice of life  That gives it all its flavor We have run  Through ev'ry change that fancy at the loom  Exhausted has had genius to supply  And studious of mutation still discard  A real elegance a little used  For monstrous novelty and strange disguise  We sacrifice to dress till houshold joys  And comforts cease Dress drains our cellar dry  And keeps our larder lean Puts out our fires  And introduces hunger frost and woe  Where peace and hospitality might reign  What man that lives and that knows how to live  Would fail t' exhibit at the public shows  A form as splendid as the proudest there  Though appetite raise outcries at the cost  A man o' th' town dines late but soon enough  With reasonable forecast and dispatch  T' insure a sidebox station at half price  You think perhaps so delicate his dress  His daily fare as delicate Alas  He picks clean teeth and busy as he seems  With an old tavern quill is hungry yet  The rout is folly's circle which she draws  With magic wand So potent is the spell  That none decoy'd into that fatal ring  Unless by heaven's peculiar grace escape  There we grow early grey but never wise  There form connexions and acquire no friend  Solicit pleasure hopeless of success  Waste youth in occupations only fit  For second childhood and devote old age  To sports which only childhood could excuse  There they are happiest who dissemble best  Their weariness and they the most polite  Who squander time and treasure with a smile  Though at their own destruction She that asks  Her dear five hundred friends contemns them all  And hates their coming They what can they less  Make just reprisals and with cringe and shrug  And bow obsequious hide their hate of her  All catch the frenzy downward from her Grace  Whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies  And gild our chamber cielings as they pass  To her who frugal only that her thrift  May feed excesses she can ill afford  Is hackney'd home unlacquey'd Who in haste  Alighting turns the key in her own door  And at the watchman's lantern borrowing light  Finds a cold bed her only comfort left  Wives beggar husbands husbands starve their wives  On fortune's velvet altar off'ring up  Their last poor pittance Fortune most severe  Of goddesses yet known and costlier far  Than all that held their routs in heathen heav'n  So fare we in this prisonhouse the world  And 'tis a fearful spectacle to see  So many maniacs dancing in their chains  They gaze upon the links that hold them fast  With eyes of anguish execrate their lot  Then shake them in despair and dance again  Now basket up the family of plagues  That waste our vitals Peculation sale  Of honor perjury corruption frauds  By forgery by subterfuge of law  By tricks and lies as num'rous and as keen  As the necessities their authors feel  Then cast them closely bundled ev'ry brat  At the right door Profusion is its sire  Profusion unrestrain'd with all that's base  In character has litter'd all the land  And bred within the mem'ry of no few  A priesthood such as Baal's was of old  A people such as never was 'till now  It is a hungry viceit eats up all  That gives society its beauty strength  Convenience and security and use  Makes men mere vermin worthy to be trapp'd  And gibbetted as fast as catchpole claws  Can seize the slipp'ry prey Unties the knot  Of union and converts the sacred band  That holds mankind together to a scourge  Profusion deluging a state with lusts  Of grossest nature and of worst effects  Prepares it for its ruin Hardens blinds  And warps the consciences of public men  Till they can laugh at virtue mock the fools  That trust them and in th' end disclose a face  That would have shock'd credulity herself  Unmask'd vouchsafing this their sole excuse  Since all alike are selfishwhy not they  This does Profusion and th' accursed cause  Of such deep mischief has itself a cause  In colleges and halls in ancient days  When learning virtue piety and truth  Were precious and inculcated with care  There dwelt a sage call'd Discipline His head  Not yet by time completely silver'd o'er  Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth  But strong for service still and unimpair'd  His eye was meek and gentle and a smile  Play'd on his lips and in his speech was heard  Paternal sweetness dignity and love  The occupation dearest to his heart  Was to encourage goodness He would stroke  The head of modest and ingenuous worth  That blush'd at its own praise and press the youth  Close to his side that pleas'd him Learning grew  Beneath his care a thriving vig'rous plant  The mind was well inform'd the passions held  Subordinate and diligence was choice  If e'er it chanced as sometimes chance it must  That one among so many overleap'd  The limits of controul his gentle eye  Grew stern and darted a severe rebuke  His frown was full of terror and his voice  Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe  As left him not till penitence had won  Lost favor back again and closed the breach  But discipline a faithful servant long  Declined at length into the vale of years  A palsy struck his arm his sparkling eye  Was quench'd in rheums of age his voice unstrung  Grew tremulous and moved derision more  Than rev'rence in perverse rebellious youth  So colleges and halls neglected much  Their good old friend and Discipline at length  O'erlook'd and unemploy'd fell sick and died  Then study languish'd emulation slept  And virtue fled The schools became a scene  Of solemn farce where ignorance in stilts  His cap well lined with logic not his own  With parrot tongue perform'd the scholar's part  Proceeding soon a graduated dunce  Then compromise had place and scrutiny  Became stoneblind precedence went in truck  And he was competent whose purse was so  A dissolution of all bonds ensued  The curbs invented for the muleish mouth  Of headstrong youth were broken bars and bolts  Grew rusty by disuse and massy gates  Forgot their office op'ning with a touch  'Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade  The tassell'd cap and the spruce band a jest  A mock'ry of the world What need of these  For gamesters jockies brothellers impure  Spendthrifts and booted sportsmen

metropolis  BOOK III  THE GARDEN  AS one who long in thickets and in brakes  Entangled winds now this way and now that  His devious course uncertain seeking home  Or having long in miry ways been foiled  And sore discomfited from slough to slough  Plunging and half despairing of escape  If chance at length he find a greenswerd smooth  And faithful to the foot his spirits rise  He chirrups brisk his earerecting steed  And winds his way with pleasure and with ease  So I designing other themes and call'd  T' adorn the Sofa with eulogium due  To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams  Have rambled wide In country city seat  Of academic fame howe'er deserved  Long held and scarcely disengaged at last  But now with pleasant pace a cleanlier road  I mean to tread I feel myself at large  Courageous and refresh'd for future toil  If toil await me or if dangers new  Since pulpits fail and soundingboards reflect  Most part an empty ineffectual sound  What chance that I to fame so little known  Nor conversant with men or manners much  Should speak to purpose or with better hope  Crack the satyric thong 'twere wiser far  For me enamour'd of sequester'd scenes  And charm'd with rural beauty to repose  Where chance may throw me beneath elm or vine  My languid limbs when summer fears the plains  Or when rough winter rages on the soft  And shelter'd Sofa while the nitrous air  Feeds a blue flame and makes a chearful hearth  There undisturb'd by folly and appriz'd  How great the danger of disturbing her  To muse in silence or at least confine  Remarks that gall so many to the few  My partners in retreat Disgust conceal'd  Is ofttimes proof of wisdom when the fault  Is obstinate and cure beyond our reach  Domestic happiness thou only bliss  Of Paradise that has survived the fall  Though few now taste thee unimpair'd and pure  Or tasting long enjoy thee too infirm  Or too incautious to preserve thy sweets  Unmixt with drops of bitter which neglect  Or temper sheds into thy chrystal cup  Thou art the nurse of virtue In thine arms  She smiles appearing as in truth she is  Heav'n born and destined to the skies again  Thou art not known where pleasure is adored  That reeling goddess with the zoneless waist  And wand'ring eyes still leaning on the arm  Of novelty her fickle frail support  For thou art meek and constant hating change  And finding in the calm of truthtied love  Joys that her stormy raptures never yeild  Forsaking thee what shipwreck have we made  Of honor dignity and fair renown  'Till prostitution elbows us aside  In all our crowded streets and senates seem  Convened for purposes of empire less  Than to release th' adultress from her bond  Th' adultress what a theme for angry verse  What provocation to th' indignant heart  That feels for injured love but I disdain  The nauseous task to paint her as she is  Cruel abandon'd glorying in her shame  No Let her pass and chariotted along  In guilty splendor shake the public ways  The frequency of crimes has wash'd them white  And verse of mine shall never brand the wretch  Whom matrons now of character unsmirch'd  And chaste themselves are not ashamed to own  Virtue and vice had bound'ries in old time  Not to be pass'd And she that had renounced  Her sex's honor was renounced herself  By all that priz'd it not for prud'ry's sake  But dignity's resentful of the wrong  'Twas hard perhaps on here and there a waif  Desirous to return and not received  But was an wholesome rigor in the main  And taught th' unblemish'd to preserve with care  That purity whose loss was loss of all  Men too were nice in honor in those days  And judg'd offenders well And he that sharp'd  And pocketted a prize by fraud obtain'd  Was mark'd and shunn'd as odious He that sold  His country or was slack when she required  His ev'ry nerve in action and at stretch  Paid with the blood that he had basely spared  The price of his default But now yes now  We are become so candid and so fair  So lib'ral in construction and so rich  In christian charity a goodnatured age  That they are safe sinners of either sex  Transgress what laws they may Well dress'd well bred  Well equipaged is ticket good enough  To pass us readily through ev'ry door  Hypocrisy detest her as we may  And no man's hatred ever wrong'd her yet  May claim this merit still that she admits  The worth of what she mimics with such care  And thus gives virtue indirect applause  But she has burnt her mask not needed here  Where vice has such allowance that her shifts  And specious semblances have lost their use  I was a stricken deer that left the herd  Long since with many an arrow deep infixt  My panting side was charged when I withdrew  To seek a tranquil death in distant shades  There was I found by one who had himself  Been hurt by th' archers In his side he bore  And in his hands and feet the cruel scars  With gentle force soliciting the darts  He drew them forth and heal'd and bade me live  Since then with few associates in remote  And silent woods I wander far from those  My former partners of the peopled scene  With few associates and not wishing more  Here much I ruminate as much I may  With other views of men and manners now  Than once and others of a life to come  I see that all are wand'rers gone astray  Each in his own delusions they are lost  In chace of fancied happiness still wooed  And never won Dream after dream ensues  And still they dream that they shall still succeed  And still are disappointed rings the world  With the vain stir I sum up half mankind  And add twothirds of the remainder half  And find the total of their hopes and fears  Dreams empty dreams The million flit as gay  As if created only like the fly  That spreads his motley wings in th' eye of noon  To sport their season and be seen no more  The rest are sober dreamers grave and wise  And pregnant with discov'ries new and rare  Some write a narrative of wars and feats  Of heroes little known and call the rant  An history Describe the man of whom  His own cooevals took but little note  And paint his person character and views  As they had known him from his mother's womb  They disentangle from the puzzled skein  In which obscurity has wrapp'd them up  The threads of politic and shrewd design  That ran through all his purposes and charge  His mind with meanings that he never had  Or having kept conceal'd Some drill and bore  The solid earth and from the strata there  Extract a register by which we learn  That he who made it and reveal'd its date  To Moses was mistaken in its age  Some more acute and more industrious still  Contrive creation Travel nature up  To the sharp peak of her sublimest height  And tell us whence the stars Why some are fixt  And planetary some What gave them first  Rotation from what fountain flow'd their light  Great contest follows and much learned dust  Involves the combatants each claiming truth  And truth disclaiming both And thus they spend  The little wick of life's poor shallow lamp  In playing tricks with nature giving laws  To distant worlds and trifling in their own  Is't not a pity now that tickling rheums  Should ever teaze the Iungs and blear the sight  Of oracles like these Great pity too  That having wielded th' elements and built  A thousand systems each in his own way  They should go out in fume and be forgot  Ah what is life thus spent and what are they  But frantic who thus spend it all for smoke  Eternity for bubbles proves at last  A senseless bargain When I see such games  Play'd by the creatures of a pow'r who swears  That he will judge the earth and call the fool  To a sharp reck'ning that has lived in vain  And when I weigh this seeming wisdom well  And prove it in th' infallible result  So hollow and so falseI feel my heart  Dissolve in pity and account the learn'd  If this be learning most of all deceived  Great crimes alarm the conscience but she sleeps  While thoughtful man is plausibly amused  Defend me therefore common sense say I  From reveries so airy from the toil  Of dropping buckets into empty wells  And growing old in drawing nothing up  'Twere well says one sage erudite profound  Terribly arch'd and aquiline his nose  And overbuilt with most impending brows  'Twere well could you permit the world to live  As the world pleases What's the world to you  Much I was born of woman and drew milk  As sweet as charity from human breasts  I think articulate I laugh and weep  And exercise all functions of a man  How then should I and any man that lives  Be strangers to each other pierce my vein  Take of the crimson stream meandring there  And catechise it well Apply your glass  Search it and prove now if it be not blood  Congenial with thine own And if it be  What edge of subtlety canst thou suppose  Keen enough wise and skilful as thou art  To cut the link of brotherhood by which  One common Maker bound me to the kind  True I am no proficient I confess  In arts like yours I cannot call the swift  And perilous lightnings from the angry clouds  And bid them hide themselves in th' earth beneath  I cannot analyse the air nor catch  The parallax of yonder luminous point  That seems half quench'd in the immense abyss  Such pow'rs I boast notneither can I rest  A silent witness of the headlong rage  Or heedless folly by which thousands die  Bone of my bone and kindred souls to mine  God never meant that man should scale the heav'ns  By strides of human wisdom In his works  Though wond'rous he commands us in his word  To seek him rather where his mercy shines  The mind indeed enlighten'd from above  Views him in all Ascribes to the grand cause  The grand effect Acknowledges with joy  His manner and with rapture tastes his stile  But never yet did philosophic tube  That brings the planets home into the eye  Of observation and discovers else  Not visible his family of worlds  Discover him that rules them such a veil  Hangs over mortal eyes blind from the birth  And dark in things divine Full often too  Our wayward intellect the more we learn  Of nature overlooks her author more  From instrumental causes proud to draw  Conclusions retrograde and mad mistake  But if his word once teach us shoot a ray  Through all the heart's dark chambers and reveal  Truths undiscern'd but by that holy light  Then all is plain Philosophy baptized  In the pure fountain of eternal love  Has eyes indeed and viewing all she sees  As meant to indicate a God to man  Gives  him  his praise and forfeits not her own  Learning has borne such fruit in other days  On all her branches Piety has found  Friends in the friends of science and true pray'r  Has flow'd from lips wet with Castalian dews  Such was thy wisdom Newton childlike sage  Sagacious reader of the works of God  And in his word sagacious Such too thine  Milton whose genius had angelic wings  And fed on manna And such thine in whom  Our British Themis gloried with just cause  Immortal Hale for deep discernment praised  And sound integrity not more than famed  For sanctity of manners undefiled  All flesh is grass and all its glory fades  Like the fair flow'r dishevell'd in the wind  Riches have wings and grandeur is a dream  The man we celebrate must find a tomb  And we that worship him ignoble graves  Nothing is proof against the gen'ral curse  Of vanity that seizes all below  The only amaranthine flow'r on earth  Is virtue th' only lasting treasure truth  But what is truth 'twas Pilate's question put  To truth itself that deign'd him no reply  And wherefore will not God impart his light  To them that ask itFreely'tis his joy  His glory and his nature to impart  But to the proud uncandid insincere  Or negligent enquirer not a spark  What's that which brings contempt upon a book  And him that writes it though the stile be neat  The method clear and argument exact  That makes a minister in holy things  The joy of many and the dread of more  His name a theme for praise and for reproach  That while it gives us worth in God's account  Depreciates and undoes us in our own  What pearl is it that rich men cannot buy  That learning is too proud to gather up  But which the poor and the despised of all  Seek and obtain and often find unsought  Tell me and I will tell thee what is truth  Oh friendly to the best pursuits of man  Friendly to thought to virtue and to peace  Domestic life in rural leisure pass'd  Few know thy value and few taste thy sweets  Though many boast thy favours and affect  To understand and chuse thee for their own  But foolish man foregoes his proper bliss  Ev'n as his first progenitor and quits  Though placed in paradise for earth has still  Some traces of her youthful beauty left  Substantial happiness for transient joy  Scenes form'd for contemplation and to nurse  The growing seeds of wisdom that suggest  By ev'ry pleasing image they present  Reflections such as meliorate the heart  Compose the passions and exalt the mind  Scenes such as these 'tis his supreme delight  To fill with riot and defile with blood  Should some contagion kind to the poor brutes  We persecute annihilate the tribes  That draw the sportsman over hill and dale  Fearless and rapt away from all his cares  Should never gamefowl hatch her eggs again  Nor baited hook deceive the fishes eye  Could pageantry and dance and feast and song  Be quell'd in all our summermonth retreats  How many selfdeluded nymphs and swains  Who dream they have a taste for fields and groves  Would find them hideous nurs'ries of the spleen  And crowd the roads impatient for the town  They love the country and none else who seek  For their own sake its silence and its shade  Delights which who would leave that has a heart  Susceptible of pity or a mind  Cultured and capable of sober thought  For all the savage din of the swift pack  And clamours of the field detested sport  That owes its pleasures to another's pain  That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks  Of harmless nature dumb but yet endued  With eloquence that agonies inspire  Of silent tears and heartdistending sighs  Vain tears alas and sighs that never find  A corresponding tone in jovial souls  Wellone at least is safe One shelter'd hare  Has never heard the sanguinary yell  Of cruel man exulting in her woes  Innocent partner of my peaceful home  Whom ten long years experience of my care  Has made at last familiar she has lost  Much of her vigilant instinctive dread  Not needful here beneath a roof like mine  Yesthou mayst eat thy bread and lick the hand  That feeds thee thou may'st frolic on the floor  At evening and at night retire secure  To thy strawcouch and slumber unalarm'd  For I have gain'd thy confidence have pledg'd  All that is human in me to protect  Thine unsuspecting gratitude and love  If I survive thee I will dig thy grave  And when I place thee in it sighing say  I knew at least one hare that had a friend  How various his employments whom the world  Calls idle and who justly in return  Esteems that busy world an idler too  Friends books a garden and perhaps his pen  Delighful industry enjoyed at home  And nature in her cultivated trim  Dressed to his taste inviting him abroad  Can he want occupation who has these  Will he be idle who has much t' enjoy  Me therefore studious of laborious ease  Not slothful happy to deceive the time  Not waste it and aware that human life  Is but a loan to be repaid with use  When he shall call his debtors to account  From whom are all our blessings business finds  Ev'n here While sedulous I seek t' improve  At least neglect not or leave unemploy'd  The mind he gave me driving it though slack  Too oft and much impeded in its work  By causes not to be divulged in vain  To its just point the service of mankind  He that attends to his interior self  That has a heart and keeps it has a mind  That hungers and supplies it and who seeks  A social not a dissipated life  Has business Feels himself engaged t' atchieve  No unimportant though a silent task  A life all turbulence and noise may seem  To him that leads it wise and to be prais'd  But wisdom is a pearl with most success  Sought in still water and beneath clear skies  He that is ever occupied in storms  Or dives not for it or brings up instead  Vainly industrious a disgraceful prize  The morning finds the selfsequester'd man  Fresh for his task intend what task he may  Whether inclement seasons recommend  His warm but simple home where he enjoys  With her who shares his pleasures and his heart  Sweet converse sipping calm the fragrant lymph  Which neatly she prepares then to his book  Well chosen and not sullenly perused  In selfish silence but imparted oft  As aught occurs that she may smile to hear  Or turn to nourishment digested well  Or if the garden with its many cares  All well repay'd demand him he attends  The welcome call conscious how much the hand  Of lubbard labor needs his watchful eye  Oft loit'ring lazily if not o'erseen  Or misapplying his unskilful strength  Nor does he govern only or direct  But much performs himself No works indeed  That ask robust tough sinews bred to toil  Servile employbut such as may amuse  Not tire demanding rather skill than force  Proud of his well spread walls he views his trees  That meet no barren interval between  With pleasure more than ev'n their fruits afford  Which save himself who trains them none can feel  These therefore are his own peculiar charge  No meaner hand may discipline the shoots  None but his steel approach them What is weak  Distemper'd or has lost prolific pow'rs  Impair'd by age his unrelenting hand  Dooms to the knife Nor does he spare the soft  And succulent that feeds its giant growth  But barren at th' expence of neighb'ring twigs  Less ostentatious and yet studded thick  With hopeful gems The rest no portion left  That may disgrace his art or disappoint  Large expectation he disposes neat  At measur'd distances that air and sun  Admitted freely may afford their aid  And ventilate and warm the swelling buds  Hence summer has her riches autumn hence  And hence ev'n winter fills his wither'd hand  With blushing fruits and plenty not his own  Miraturque novos fructus et non sua poma  VIRG  Fair recompense of labour well bestow'd  And wise precaution which a clime so rude  Makes needful still whose spring is but the child  Of churlish winter in her froward moods  Discov'ring much the temper of her sire  For oft as if in her the stteam of mild  Maternal nature had revers'd its course  She brings her infants forth with many smiles  But once deliver'd kills them with a frown  He therefore timely warn'd himself supplies  Her want of care screening and keeping warm  The plenteous bloom that no rough blast may sweep  His garlands from the boughs Again as oft  As the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild  The fence withdrawn he gives them ev'ry beam  And spreads his hopes before the blaze of day  To raise the prickly and greencoated gourd  So grateful to the palate and when rare  So coveted else base and disesteem'd  Food for the vulgar merelyis an art  That toiling ages have but just matured  And at this moment unassay'd in song  Yet gnats have had and frogs and mice long since  Their eulogy those sang the Mantuan bard  And these the Grecian in ennobling strains  And in thy numbers Phillips shines for ay  The solitary shilling Pardon then  Ye sage dispensers of poetic fame  Th' ambition of one meaner far whose pow'rs  Presuming an attempt not less sublime  Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste  Of critic appetite no sordid fare  A cucumber while costly yet and scarce  The stable yields a stercorarious heap  Impregnated with quick fermenting salts  And potent to resist the freezing blast  For 'ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf  Decidu'ous and when now November dark  Checks vegetation in the torpid plant  Exposed to his cold breath the task begins  Warily therefore and with prudent heed  He seeks a favor'd spot That where he builds  Th' agglomerated pile his frame may front  The sun's meridian disk and at the back  Enjoy close shelter wall or reeds or hedge  Impervious to the wind First he bids spread  Dry fern or litter'd hay that may imbibe  Th' ascending damps then leisurely impose  And lightly shaking it with agile hand  From the full fork the saturated straw  What longest binds the closest forms secure  The shapely side that as it rises takes  By just degrees an overhanging breadth  Shelt'ring the base with its projected eaves  Th' uplifted frame compact at ev'ry joint  And overlaid with clear translucent glass  He settles next upon the sloping mount  Whose sharp declivity shoots off secure  From the dash'd pane the deluge as it falls  He shuts it close and the first labor ends  Thrice must the voluble and restless earth  Spin round upon her axle 'ere the warmth  Slow gathering in the midst through the square mass  Diffused attain the surface When behold  A pestilent and most corrosive steam  Like a gross fog Boeotian rising fast  And fast condensed upon the dewy sash  Asks egress which obtained the overcharged  And drench'd conservatory breathes abroad  In volumes wheeling slow the vapor dank  And purified rejoices to have lost  Its foul inhabitant But to assuage  Th' impatient fervor which it first conceives  Within its reeking bosom threat'ning death  To his young hopes requires discreet delay  Experience slow preceptress teaching oft  The way to glory by miscarriage foul  Must prompt him and admonish how to catch  Th' auspicious moment when the temper'd heat  Friendly to vital motion may afford  Soft somentation and invite the seed  The seed selected wisely plump and smooth  And glossy he commits to pots of size  Diminutive well fill'd with well prepar'd  And fruitful soil that has been treasur'd long  And drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds  These on the warm and genial earth that hides  The smoking manure and o'erspreads it all  He places lightly and as time subdues  The rage of fermentation plunges deep  In the soft medium 'till they stand immers'd  Then rise the tender germs upstarting quick  And spreading wide their spongy lobes at first  Pale wan and livid but assuming soon  If fann'd by balmy and nutritious air  Strain'd through the friendly mats a vivid green  Two leaves produced two rough indented leaves  Cautious he pinches from the second stalk  A pimple that portends a future sprout  And interdicts its growth Thence straight succeed  The branches sturdy to his utmost wish  Prolific all and harbingers of more  The crowded roots demand enlargement now  And transplantation in an ampler space  Indulged in what they wish they soon supply  Large foliage overshadowing golden flowers  Blown on the summit of th' apparent fruit  These have their sexes and when summer shines  The bee transports the fertilizing meal  From flow'r to flow'r and ev'n the breathing air  Wafts the rich prize to its appointed use  Not so when winter scowls Assistant art  Then acts in nature's office brings to pass  The glad espousals and insures the crop  Grudge not ye rich since luxury must have  His dainties and the world's more num'rous half  Lives by contriving delicates for you  Grudge not the cost Ye little know the cares  The vigilance the labor and the skill  That day and night are exercised and hang  Upon the ticklish balance of suspense  That ye may garnish your profuse regales  With summer fruits brought forth by wintry suns  Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart  The process Heat and cold and wind and steam  Moisture and drought mice worms and swarming flies  Minute as dust and numberless oft work  Dire disappointment that admits no cure  And which no care can obviate It were long  Too long to tell th' expedients and the shifts  Which he that fights a season so severe  Devises while he guards his tender trust  And oft at last in vain The learn'd and wise  Sarcastic would exclaim and judge the song  Cold as its theme and like its theme the fruit  Of too much labor worthless when produced  Who loves a garden loves a greenhouse too  Unconscious of a less propitious clime  There blooms exotic beauty warm and snug  While the winds whistle and the snows descend  The spiry myrtle with unwith'ring leaf  Shines there and flourishes The golden boast  Of Portugal and western India there  The ruddier orange and the paler lime  Peep through their polish'd foliage at the storm  And seem to smile at what they need not sear  Th' amomum there with intermingling flow'rs  And cherries hangs her twigs Geranium boasts  Her crimson honors and the spangled beau  Ficoides glitters bright the winter long  All plants of ev'ry leaf that can endure  The winter's frown if screen'd from his shrewd bite  Live there and prosper Those Ausonia claims  Levantine regions these th' Azores send  Their jessamine her jessamine remote  Caffraia foreigners from many lands  They form one social shade as if convened  By magic summons of th' Orphean lyre  Yet just arrangement rarely brought to pass  But by a master's hand disposing well  The gay diversities of leaf and flow'r  Must lend its aid t' illustrate all their charms  And dress the regular yet various scene  Plant behind plant aspiring in the van  The dwarfish in the rear retired but still  Sublime above the rest the statelier stand  So once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome  A noble show while Roscius trod the stage  And so while Garrick as renown'd as he  The sons of Albion fearing each to lose  Some note of Nature's music from his lips  And covetous of Shakespeare's beauty seen  In ev'ry flash of his farbeaming eye  Nor taste alone and well contrived display  Suffice to give the marshall'd ranks the grace  Of their complete effect Much yet remains  Unsung and many cares are yet behind  And more laborious Cares on which depends  Their vigor injured soon not soon restored  The soil must be renew'd which often wash'd  Loses its treasure of salubrious salts  And disappoints the roots the slender roots  Close interwoven where they meet the vase  Must smooth be shorn away the sapless branch  Must fly before the knife the wither'd leaf  Must be detach'd and where it strews the floor  Swept with a woman's neatness breeding else  Contagion and disseminating death  Discharge but these kind offices and who  Would spare that loves them offices like these  Well they reward the toil The sight is pleased  The scent regaled each odorif'rous leaf  Each opening blossom freely breathes abroad  Its gratitude and thanks him with its sweets  So manifold all pleasing in their kind  All healthful are th' employs of rural life  Reiterated as the wheel of time  Runs round still ending and beginning still  Nor are these all To deck the shapely knoll  That softly swell'd and gayly dress'd appears  A flow'ry island from the dark green lawn  Emerging must be deemed a labor due  To no mean hand and asks the touch of taste  Here also gratefull mixture of well match'd  And sorted hues each giving each relief  And by contrasted beauty shining more  Is needful Strength may wield the pond'rous spade  May turn the clod and wheel the compost home  But elegance chief grace the garden shows  And most attractive is the fair result  Of thought the creature of a polish'd mind  Without it all is Gothic as the scene  To which th' insipid citizen resorts  Near yonder heath where industry mispent  But proud of his uncouth illchosen task  Has made a heav'n on earth With suns and moons  Of closeramm'd stones has charged th' incumber'd soil  And fairly laid the Zodiac in the dust  He therefore who would see his flow'rs disposed  Sightly and in just order 'ere he gives  The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds  Forecasts the future whole That when the scene  Shall break into its preconceived display  Each for itself and all as with one voice  Conspiring may attest his bright design  Nor even then dismissing as perform'd  His pleasant work may he suppose it done  Few selfsupported flow'rs endure the wind  Uninjured but expect th' upholding aid  Of the smoothshaven prop and neatly tied  Are wedded thus like beauty to old age  For int'rest sake the living to the dead  Some cloath the soil that feeds them far diffused  And lowly creeping modest and yet fair  Like virtue thriving most where little seen  Some more aspiring catch the neighbour shrub  With clasping tendrils and invest his branch  Else unadorn'd with many a gay festoon  And fragrant chaplet recompensing well  The strength they borrow with the grace they lend  All hate the rank society of weeds  Noisome and ever greedy to exhaust  Th' improv'rish'd earth an overbearing race  That like the multitude made factionmad  Disturb good order and degrade true worth  Oh blest seclusion from a jarring world  Which he thus occupied enjoys Retreat  Cannot indeed to guilty man restore  Lost innocence or cancel sollies past  But it has peace and much secures the mind  From all assaults of evil proving still  A faithful barrier not o'erleap'd with ease  By vicious custom raging uncontroul'd  Abroad and desolating public life  When fierce temptation seconded within  By traitor appetite and arm'd with darts  Temper'd in hell invades the throbbing breast  To combat may be glorious and success  Perhaps may crown us but to fly is safe  Had I the choice of sublunary good  What could I wish that I possess not here  Health leisure means t' improve it friendship peace  No loose or wanton though a wand'ring muse  And constant occupation without care  Thus blest I draw a picture of that bliss  Hopeless indeed that dissipated minds  And profligate abusers of a world  Created fair so much in vain for them  Should seek the guiltless joys that I describe  Allured by my report But sure no less  That selfcondemn'd they must neglect the prize  And what they will not taste must yet approve  What we admire we praise And when we praise  Advance it into notice that its worth  Acknowledg'd others may admire it too  I therefore recommend though at the risk  Of popular disgust yet boldly still  The cause of piety and sacred truth  And virtue and those scenes which God ordain'd  Should best secure them and promote them most  Scenes that I love and with regret perceive  Forsaken or through folly not enjoyed  Pure is the nymph though lib'ral of her smiles  And chaste though unconfined whom I extoll  Not as the prince in Sushan when he call'd  Vainglorious of her charms his Vashti forth  To grace the full pavilion Hi design  Was but to boast his own peculiar good  Which all might view with envy none partake  My charmer is not mine alone my sweets  And she that sweetens all my bitters too  Nature enchanting Nature in whose form  And lineaments divine I trace a hand  That errs not and find raptures still renew'd  Is free to all men universal prize  Strange that so fair a creature should yet want  Admirers and be destin'd to divide  With meaner objects ev'n the few she finds  Stripp'd of her ornaments her leaves and flow'rs  She loses all her influence Cities then  Attract us and neglected Nature pines  Abandon'd as unworthy of our love  But are not wholesome airs though unperfumed  By roses and clear suns though scarcely felt  And groves if unharmonious yet secure  From clamour and whose very silence charms  To be preferr'd to smoke to the eclipse  That Metropolitan volcano's make  Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long  And to the stir of commerce driving slow  And thund'ring loud with his ten thousand wheels  They would be were not madness in the head  And folly in the heart were England now  What England was plain hospitable kind  And undebauch'd But we have bid farewell  To all the virtues of those better days  And all their honest pleasures Mansions once  Knew their own masters and laborious hinds  That had surviv'd the father serv'd the son  Now the legitimate and rightful Lord  Is but a transient guest newly arrived  And soon to be supplanted He that saw  His patrimonial timber cast its leaf  Sells the last scantling and transfers the price  To some shrew'd sharper 'ere it buds again  Estates are landscapes gazed upon awhile  Then advertised and auctioneer'd away  The country starves and they that feed th' o'ercharged  And surfeited lew'd town with her fair dues  By a just judgment strip and starve themselves  The wings that waft our riches out of sight  Grow on the gamester's elbows and th' alert  And nimble motion of those restless joints  That never tire soon fans them all away  Improvement too the idol of the age  Is fed with many a victim Lo he comes  The omnipotent magician Brown appears  Down falls the venerable pile th' abode  Of our forefathers a grave whisker'd race  But tasteless Springs a palace in its stead  But in a distant spot where more exposed  It may enjoy th' advantage of the north  And agueish East till time shall have transform'd  Those naked acres to a shelt'ring grove  He speaks The lake in front becomes a lawn  Woods vanish hills subside and vallies rise  And streams as if created for his use  Pursue the track of his directing wand  Sinuous or strait now rapid and now slow  Now murm'ring soft now roaring in cascades  Ev'n as he bids Th' enraptur'd owner smiles  'Tis finish'd And yet finish'd as it seems  Still wants a grace th' loveliest it could show  A mine to satisfy the enormous cost  Drain'd to the last poor item of his wealth  He sighs departs and leaves the accomplished plan  That he has touch'd retouch'd many a long day  Labor'd and many a night pursued in dreams  Just when it meets his hopes and proves the heav'n  He wanted for a wealthier to enjoy  And now perhaps the glorious hour is come  When having no stake left no pledge t' indear  Her int'rests or that gives her sacred cause  A moment's operation on his love  He burns with most intense and flagrant zeal  To serve his country Ministerial grace  Deals him out money from the public chest  Or if that mine be shut some private purse  Supplies his need with an usurious loan  To be refunded duely when his vote  Wellmanaged shall have earn'd its worthy price  Oh innocent compared with arts like these  Crape and cock'd pistol and the whistling ball  Sent through the trav'llers temples he that finds  One drop of heav'ns sweet mercy in his cup  Can dig beg rot and perish wellcontent  So he may wrap himself in honest rags  At his last gasp but could not for a world  Fish up his dirty and dependent bread  From pools and ditches of the commonwealth  Sordid and sick'ning at his own success  Ambition av'rice penury incurr'd  By endless riot vanity the lust  Of pleasure and variety dispatch  As duely as the swallows disappear  The world of wand'ring knights and squires to town  London ingulphs them all The shark is there  And the shark's prey The spendthrist and the leech  That sucks him There the sycophant and he  That with bareheaded and obsequious bows  Begs a warm office doom'd to a cold jail  And groat per diem if his patron frown  The levee swarms as if in golden pomp  Were character'd on ev'ry statesman's door  "BATTER'D AND BANKRUPT FOR TUNES MENDED HERE"  These are the charms that sully and eclipse  The charms of nature 'Tis the cruel gripe  That lean hardhanded poverty inflicts  The hope of better things the chance to win  The wish to shine the thirst to be amused  That at the sound of Winter's hoary wing  Unpeople all our counties of such herds  Of flutt'ring loit'ring cringing begging loose  And wanton vagrants as make London vast  And boundless as it is a crowded coop  Oh thou resort and mart of all the earth  Chequer'd with all complexions of mankind  And spotted with all crimes in whom I see  Much that I love and more that I admire  And all that I abhor thou freckled fair  That pleases and yet shocks me I can laugh  And I can weep can hope and can despond  Feel wrath and pity when I think on thee  Ten righteous would have saved a city once  And thou hast many righteousWell for thee  That salt preserves thee more corrupted else  And therefore more obnoxious at this hour  Than Sodom in her day had pow'r to be  For whom God heard his Abr'am plead in vain  ARGUMENT of the FOURTH BOOK  The post comes

in which the moon  Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright  He comes the herald of a noisy world  With spatter'd boots strapp'd waist and frozen locks  News from all nations lumb'ring at his back  True to his charge the closepack'd load behind  Yet careless what he brings his one concern  Is to conduct it to the destin'd inn  And having dropp'd th' expected bagpass on  He whistles as he goes lighthearted wretch  Cold and yet cheerful messenger of grief  Perhaps to thousands and of joy to some  To him indiff'rent whether grief or joy  Houses in ashes and the fall of stocks  Births deaths and marriages epistles wet  With tears that trickled down the writers cheeks  Fast as the periods from his fluent quill  Or charged with am'rous sighs of absent swains  Or nymphs responsive equally affect  His horse and him unconscious of them all  But oh th' important budget usher'd in  With such heartshaking music who can say  What are its tidings have our troops awaked  Or do they still as if with opium drugg'd  Snore to the murmurs of th' Atlantic wave  Is India free and does she wear her plumed  And jewelled turban with a smile of peace  Or do we grind her still the grand debate  The popular harrangue the tart reply  The logic and the wisdom and the wit  And the loud laughI long to know them all  I burn to set th' imprison'd wranglers free  And give them voice and utt'rance once again  Now stir the fire and close the shutters fast  Let fall the curtains wheel the sofa round  And while the bubbling and loudhissing urn  Throws up a steamy column and the cups  That cheer but not inebriate wait on each  So let us welcome peaceful evening in  Not such his evening who with shining face  Sweats in the crowded theatre and squeezed  And bored with elbowpoints through both his sides  Out scolds the ranting actor on the stage  Nor his who patient stands 'till his feet throb  And his head thumps to feed upon the breath  Of patriots bursting with heroic rage  Or placemen all tranquillity and smiles  'This folio of four pages happy work  Which not ev'n critics criticise that holds  Inquisitive attention while I read  Fast bound in chains of silence which the fair  Though eloquent themselves yet fear to break  What is it but a map of busy life  Its fluctuations and its vast concerns  Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge  That tempts ambition On the summit see  The seals of office glitter in his eyes  He climbs he pants he grasps them At his heels  Close at his heels a demagogue ascends  And with a dext'rous jerk soon twists him down  And wins them but to lose them in his turn  Here rills of oily eloquence in soft  Maeanders lubricate the course they take  The modest speaker is ashamed and grieved  T' engross a moment's notice and yet begs  Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts  However trivial all that he conceives  Sweet bashfulness it claims at least this praise  The dearth of information and good sense  That it foretells us always comes to pass  Cataracts of declamation thunder here  There forests of nomeaning spread the page  In which all comprehension wanders lost  While fields of pleasantry amuse us there  With merry descants on a nation's woes  The rest appears a wilderness of strange  But gay confusion roses for the cheeks  And lilies for the brows of faded age  Teeth for the toothless ringlets for the bald  Heav'n earth and ocean plunder'd of their sweets  Nectareous essences Olympian dews  Sermons and city feasts and fav'rite airs  Aetherial journies submarine exploits  And Katterfelto with his hair on end  At his own wonders wond'ring for his bread  Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat  To peep at such a world To see the stir  Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd  To hear the roar she sends through all her gates  At a safe distance where the dying sound  Falls a soft murmur on th' uninjured ear  Thus sitting and surveying thus at ease  The globe and its concerns I seem advanced  To some secure and more than mortal height  That lib'rates and exempts me from them all  It turns submitted to my view turns round  With all its generations I behold  The tumult and am still The sound of war  Has lost its terrors 'ere it reaches me  Grieves but alarms me not I mourn the pride  And av'rice that make man a wolf to man  Hear the faint echo of those brazen throats  By which he speaks the language of his heart  And sigh but never tremble at the sound  He travels and expatiates as the bee  From flow'r to flow'r so he from land to land  The manners customs policy of all  Pay contribution to the store he gleans  He sucks intelligence in ev'ry clime  And spreads the honey of his deep research  At his return a rich repast for me  He travels and I too I tread his deck  Ascend his topmast through his peering eyes  Discover countries with a kindred heart  Suffer his woes and share in his escapes  While fancy like the finger of a clock  Runs the great circuit and is still at home  Oh Winter ruler of th' inverted year  Thy scatter'd hair with sleet like ashes fill'd  Thy breath congeal'd upon thy lips thy cheeks  Fring'd with a beard made white with other snows  Than those of age thy forehead wrapt in clouds  A leafless branch thy sceptre and thy throne  A sliding car indebted to no wheels  But urged by storms along its slipp'ry way  I love thee all unlovely as thou seem'st  And dreaded as thou art Thou hold'st the sun  A pris'ner in the yet undawning East  Short'ning his journey between morn and noon  And hurrying him impatient of his stay  Down to the rosy West But kindly still  Compensating his loss with added hours  Of social converse and instructive ease  And gathering at short notice in one group  The family dispersed and fixing thought  Not less dispersed by day light and its cares  I crown thee King of intimate delights  Fireside enjoyments homeborn happiness  And all the comforts that the lowly roof  Of undisturb'd retirement and the hours  Of long uninterrupted evening know  No ratt'ling wheels stop short before these gates  No powder'd pert proficient in the art  Of sounding an alarm assaults these doors  'Till the street rings No stationary steeds  Cough their own knell while heedless of the sound  The silent circle fan themselves and quake  But here the needle plies its busy task  The pattern grows the welldepicted flow'r  Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn  Unfolds its bosom buds and leaves and sprigs  And curling tendrils gracefully disposed  Follow the nimble finger of the fair  A wreath that cannot fade of flow'rs that blow  With most success when all besides decay  The poet's or historian's page by one  Made vocal for th' amusement of the rest  The sprightly lyre whose treasure of sweet sounds  The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out  And the clear voice symphonious yet distinct  And in the charming strife triumphant still  Beguile the night and set a keener edge  On female industry the threaded steel  Flies swiftly and unfelt the task proceeds  The volume closed the customary rites  Of the last meal commence A Roman meal  Such as the mistress of the world once found  Delicious when her patriots of high note  Perhaps by moonlight at their humble doors  And under an old oak's domestic shade  Enjoyed spare feast a radish and an egg  Discourse ensues not trivial yet not dull  Nor such as with a frown forbids the play  Of fancy or proscribes the sound of mirth  Nor do we madly like an impious world  Who deem religion frenzy and the God  That made them an intruder on their joys  Start at his awful name or deem his praise  A jarring note Themes of a graver tone  Exciting oft our gratitude and love  While we retrace with mem'ry's pointing wand  That calls the past to our exact review  The dangers we have scaped the broken snare  The disappointed foe deliv'rance found  Unlook'd for life preserved and peace restored  Fruits of omnipotent eternal love  Oh evenings worthy of the Gods exclaim'd  The Sabine bard Oh evenings I reply  More to be prized and coveted than yours  As more illumin'd and with nobler truths  That I and mine and those we love enjoy  Is winter hideous in a garb like this  Needs he the tragic fur the smoke of lamps  The pentup breath of an unsav'ry throng  To thaw him into feeling or the smart  And snappish dialogue that flippant wits  Call comedy to prompt him with a smile  The selfcomplacent actor when he views  Stealing a side long glance at a full house  The slope of faces from the floor to th' roof  As if one masterspring controul'd them all  Relax'd into an universal grin  Sees not a count'nance there that speaks a joy  Half so refin'd or so sincere as ours  Cards were superfluous here with all the tricks  That idleness has ever yet contrived  To fill the void of an unfurnish'd brain  To palliate dullness and give time a shove  Time as he passes us has a dove's wing  Unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound  But the world's time is time in masquerade  Theirs should I paint him has his pinions fledg'd  With motley plumes and where the peacock shows  His azure eyes is tinctured black and red  With spots quadrangular of di'mond form  Ensanguin'd hearts clubs typical of strife  And spades the emblem of untimely graves  What should be and what was an hourglass once  Becomes a dicebox and a billiard mast  Well does the work of his destructive scythe  Thus deck'd he charms a world whom fashion blinds  To his true worth most pleas'd when idle most  Whose only happy are their wasted hours  Ev'n misses at whose age their mother's wore  The backstring and the bib assume the dress  Of womanhood sit pupils in the school  Of carddevoted time and night by night  Plac'd at some vacant corner of the board  Learn ev'ry trick and soon play all the game  But truce with censure Roving as I rove  Where shall I find an end or how proceed  As he that travels far oft turns aside  To view some rugged rock or mould'ring tow'r  Which seen delights him not then coming home  Describes and prints it that the world may know  How far he went for what was nothing worth  So I with brush in hand and pallet spread  With colours mixt for a far diff'rent use  Paint cards and dolls and ev'ry idle thing  That fancy finds in her excursive flights  Come evening once again season of peace  Return sweet evening and continue long  Methinks I see thee in the streaky west  With matronstep slowmoving while the night  Treads on thy sweeping train one hand employ'd  In letting fall the curtain of repose  On bird and beast the other charged for man  With sweet oblivion of the cares of day  Not sumptuously adorn'd nor needing aid  Like homely featur'd night of clust'ring gems  A star or two just twinkling on thy brow  Suffices thee save that the moon is thine  No less than hers not worn indeed on high  With ostentatious pageantry but set  With modest grandeur in thy purple zone  Resplendent less but of an ampler round  Come then and thou shalt find thy vot'try calm  Or make me so Composure is thy gift  And whether I devote thy gentle hours  To books to music or the poets toil  To weaving nets for birdalluring fruit  Or twining silken threads round iv'ry reels  When they command whom man was born to please  I slight thee not but make thee welcome still  Just when our drawingrooms begin to blaze  With lights by clear reflection multiplied  From many a mirrour in which he of Gath  Goliah might have seen his giant bulk  Whole without stooping tow'ring crest and all  My pleasures too begin But me perhaps  The glowing hearth may satisfy awhile  With faint illumination that uplifts  The shadow to the cieling there by fits  Dancing uncouthly to the quiv'ring flame  Not undelightful is an hour to me  So spent in parlour twilight such a gloom  Suits well the thoughtfull or unthinking mind  The mind contemplative with some new theme  Pregnant or indisposed alike to all  Laugh ye who boast your more mercurial pow'rs  That never feel a stupor know no pause  Nor need one I am conscious and confess  Fearless a soul that does not always think  Me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild  Sooth'd with a waking dream of houses tow'rs  Trees churches and strange visages express'd  In the red cinders while with poring eye  I gazed myself creating what I saw  Nor less amused have I quiescent watch'd  The sooty films that play upon the bars  Pendulous and foreboding in the view  Of superstition prophesying still  Though still deceived some strangers near approach  'Tis thus the understanding takes repose  In indolent vacuity of thought  And sleeps and is refresh'd Meanwhile the face  Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask  Of deep deliberation as the man  Were task'd to his full strength absorb'd and lost  Thus oft reclin'd at ease I lose an hour  At evening till at length the freezing blast  That sweeps the bolted shutter summons home  The recollected powers and snapping short  The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves  Her brittle toys restores me to myself  How calm is my recess and how the frost  Raging abroad and the rough wind endear  The silence and the warmth enjoy'd within  I saw the woods and fields at close of day  A variegated show the meadows green  Though faded and the lands where lately waved  The golden harvest of a mellow brown  Upturn'd so lately by the forceful share  I saw far off the weedy fallows smile  With verdure not unprofitable grazed  By flocks fast feeding and selecting each  His fav'rite herb while all the leafless groves  That skirt th' horizon wore a sable hue  Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve  Tomorrow brings a change a total change  Which even now though silently perform'd  And slowly and by most unfelt the face  Of universal nature undergoes  Fast falls a fleecy show'r The downy flakes  Descending and with neverceasing lapse  Softly alighting upon all below  Assimilate all objects Earth receives  Gladly the thick'ning mantle and the green  And tender blade that fear'd the chilling blast  Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil  In such a world so thorny and where none  Finds happiness unblighted or if sound  Without some thistly sorrow at its side  It seems the part of wisdom and no sin  Against the law of love to measure lots  With less distinguish'd than ourselves that thus  We may with patience bear our mod'rate ills  And sympathize with others suffering more  Ill fares the trav'ller now and he that stalks  In pond'rous boots beside his reeking team  The wain goes heavily impeded sore  By congregated loads adhering close  To the clogg'd wheels and in its sluggish pace  Noiseless appears a moving hill of snow  The toiling steeds expand the nostril wide  While ev'ry breath by respiration strong  Forced downward is consolidated soon  Upon their jutting chests He form'd to bear  The pelting brunt of the tempestuous night  With halfshut eyes and pucker'd cheeks and teeth  Presented bare against the storm plods on  One hand secures his hat save when with both  He brandishes his pliant length of whip  Resounding oft and never heard in vain  On happy and in my account denied  That sensibility of pain with which  Refinement is endued thrice happy thou  Thy frame robust and hardy feels indeed  The piercing cold but feels it unimpair'd  The learned finger never need explore  Thy vig'rous pulse and the unhealthful East  That breathes the spleen and searches ev'ry bone  Of the infirm is wholesome air to thee  Thy days roll on exempt from household care  Thy waggon is thy wife and the poor beasts  That drag the dull companion to and fro  Thine helpless charge dependent on thy care  Ah treat them kindly rude as thou appear'st  Yet show that thou hast mercy which the great  With needless hurry whirl'd from place to place  Humane as they would seem not always show  Poor yet industrious modest quiet neat  Such claim compassion in a night like this  And have a friend in ev'ry feeling heart  Warm'd while it lasts by labor all day long  They brave the season and yet find at eve  Ill clad and fed but sparely time to cool  The frugal housewife trembles when she lights  Her scanty stock of brushwood blazing clear  But dying soon like all terrestrial joys  The few small embers left she nurses well  And while her infant race with outspread hands  And crowded knees sit cow'ring o'er the sparks  Retires content to quake so they be warm'd  The man feels least as more inur'd than she  To winter and the current in his veins  More briskly moved by his severer toil  Yet he too finds his own distress in theirs  The taper soon extinguished which I saw  Dangled along at the cold fingers end  Just when the day declined and the brown loaf  Lodged on the shelf halfeaten without sauce  Of sav'ry cheese or butter costlier still  Sleep seems their only refuge For alas  Where penury is felt the thought is chain'd  And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few  With all this thrift they thrive not All the care  Ingenious parsimony takes but just  Saves the small inventory bed and stool  Skillet and old carved chest from public sale  They live and live without extorted alms  From grudging hands but other boast have none  To sooth their honest pride that scorns to beg  Nor comfort else but in their mutual love  I praise you much ye meek and patient pair  For ye are worthy chusing rather far  A dry but independent crust hardearn'd  And eaten with a sigh than to endure  The rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs  Of knaves in office partial in the work  Of distribution lib'ral of their aid  To clam'rous importunity in rags  But ofttimes deaf to suppliants who would blush  To wear a tatter'd garb however coarse  Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth  These ask with painful shyness and refused  Because deserving silently retire  But be ye of good courage Time itself  Shall much befriend you Time shall give increase  And all your num'rous progeny well train'd  But helpless in few years shall find their hands  And labor too Meanwhile ye shall not want  What conscious of your virtues we can spare  Nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send  I mean the man who when the distant poor  Need help denies them nothing but his name  But poverty with most who whimper forth  Their long complaints is self inflicted woe  Th' effect of laziness or sottish waste  Now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad  For plunder much solicitous how best  He may compensate for a day of sloth  By works of darkness and nocturnal wrong  Woe to the gard'ner's pale the farmer's hedge  Plash'd neatly and secured with driven stakes  Deep in the loamy bank Uptorn by strength  Resistless in so bad a cause but lame  To better deeds he bundles up the spoil  An asses burthen and when laden most  And heaviest light of foot steals fast away  Nor does the boarded hovel better guard  The well stack'd pile of riven logs and roots  From his pernicious force Nor will he leave  Unwrench'd the door however well secured  Where chanticleer amidst his haram sleeps  In unsuspecting pomp Twitched from the perch  He gives the princely bird with all his wives  To his voracious bag struggling in vain  And loudly wond'ring at the sudden change  Nor this to feed his own 'Twere some excuse  Did pity of their sufferings warp aside  His principle and tempt him into sin  For their support so destitute But they  Neglected pine at home themselves as more  Exposed than others with less scruple made  His victims robb'd of their defenceless all  Cruel is all he does 'Tis quenchless thirst  Of ruinous ebriety that prompts  His ev'ry action and imbrutes the man  Oh for a law to noose the villain's neck  Who starves his own Who persecutes the blood  He gave them in his childrens veins and hates  And wrongs the woman he has sworn to love  Pass where we may through city or through town  Village or hamlet of this merry land  Though lean and beggar'd ev'ry twentieth pace  Conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff  Of stale debauch forthissuing from the styes  That law has licensed as makes temp'rance reel  There sit involved and lost in curling clouds  Of Indian fume and guzzling deep the boor  The lacquey and the groom The craftsman there  Takes a Lethaean leave of all his toil  Smith cobler joiner he that plies the sheers  And he that kneads the dough all loud alike  All learned and all drunk The fiddle screams  Plaintive and piteous as it wept and wailed  Its wasted tones and harmony unheard  Fierce the dispute whate'er the theme While she  Fell Discord arbitress of such debate  Perch'd on the signpost holds with even hand  Her undecisive scales In this she lays  A weight of ignorance in that of pride  And smiles delighted with th' eternal poise  Dire is the frequent curse and its twin sound  The cheekdistending oath not to be praised  As ornamental musical polite  Like those which modern senators employ  Whose oath is rhet'ric and who swear for fame  Behold the schools in which plebeian minds  Once simple are initiated in arts  Which some may practise with politer grace  But none with readier skill tis here they learn  The road that leads from competence and peace  To indigence and rapine till at last  Society grown weary of the load  Shakes her incumber'd lap and casts them out  But censure profits little Vain th' attempt  To advertize in verse a public pest  That like the filth with which the peasant feeds  His hungry acres stinks and is of use  Th' excise is fatten'd with the rich result  Of all this riot And ten thousand casks  For ever dribbling out their base contents  Touched by the Midas finger of the state  Bleed gold for Ministers to sport away  Drink and be mad then 'Tis your country bids  Gloriously drunk obey th' important call  Her cause demands th' assistance of your throats  Ye all can swallow and she asks no more  Would I had fall'n upon those happier days  That poets celebrate Those golden times  And those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings  And Sydney warbler of poetic prose  Nymphs were Dianas then and swains had hearts  That felt their virtues Innocence it seems  From courts dismiss'd found shelter in the groves  The footsteps of simplicity impress'd  Upon the yielding herbage so they sing  Then were not all effaced Then speech profane  And manners profligate were rarely found  Observed as prodigies and soon reclaim'd  Vain wish those days were never Airy dreams  Sat for the picture And the poet's hand  Imparting substance to an empty shade  Imposed a gay delirium for a truth  Grant it I still must envy them an age  That favor'd such a dream in days like these  Impossible when virtue is so scarce  That to suppose a scene where she presides  Is tramontane and stumbles all belief  No We are polish'd now The rural lass  Whom once her virgin modesty and grace  Her artless manners and her neat attire  So dignified that she was hardly less  Than the fair shepherdess of old romance  Is seen no more The character is lost  Her head adorn'd with lappets pinn'd aloft  And ribbands streaming gay superbly raised  And magnified beyond all human size  Indebted to some smart wigweavers hand  For more than half the tresses it sustains  Her elbows ruffled and her tott'ring form  Ill propp'd upon French heels she might be deemed  But that the basket dangling on her arm  Interprets her more truely of a rank  Too proud for dairywork or sale of eggs  Expect her soon with footboy at her heels  No longer blushing for her aukward load  Her train and her umbrella all her care  The town has tinged the country And the stain  Appears a spot upon a vestal's robe  The worse for what it soils The fashion runs  Down into scenes still rural but alas  Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now  Time was when in the pastoral retreat  Th' unguarded door was safe Men did not watch  T' invade another's right or guard their own  Then sleep was undisturb'd by fear unscared  By drunken howlings and the chilling tale  Of midnight murther was a wonder heard  With doubtful credit told to frighten babes  But farewell now to unsuspicious nights  And slumbers unalarm'd Now 'ere you sleep  See that your polish'd arms be prim'd with care  And drop the nightbolt Ruffians are abroad  And the first larum of the cock's shrill throat  May prove a trumpet summoning your ear  To horrid sounds of hostile feet within  Ev'n daylight has its dangers And the walk  Through pathless wastes and woods unconscious once  Of other tenants than melodious birds  Or harmless flocks is hazardous and bold  Lamented change to which full many a cause  Invet'rate hopeless of a cure conspires  The course of human things from good to ill  From ill to worse is fatal never fails  Increase of pow'r begets increase of wealth  Wealth luxury and luxury excess  Excess the scrophulous and itchy plague  That seizes first the opulent descends  To the next rank contagious and in time  Taints downward all the graduated scale  Of order from the chariot to the plough  The rich and they that have an arm to check  The license of the lowest in degree  Desert their office and themselves intent  On pleasure haunt the capital and thus  To all the violence of lawless hands  Resign the scenes their presence might protect  Authority herself not seldom sleeps  Though resident and witness of the wrong  The plump convivial parson often bears  The magisterial sword in vain and lays  His rev'rence and his worship both to rest  On the same cushion of habitual sloth  Perhaps timidity restrains his arm  When he should strike he trembles and sets free  Himself enslaved by terror of the band  Th' audacious convict whom he dares not bind  Perhaps though by profession ghostly pure  He too may have his vice and sometimes prove  Less dainty than becomes his grave outside  In lucrative concerns Examine well  His milkwhite hand The palm is hardly clean  But here and there an ugly smutch appears  Foh 'twas a bribe that left it He has touched  Corruption Whoso seeks an audit here  Propitious pays his tribute game or fish  Wildfowl or ven'son and his errand speeds  But faster far and more than all the rest  A noble cause which none who bears a spark  Of public virtue ever wish'd removed  Works the deplor'd and mischievous effect  'Tis universal soldiership has stabb'd  The heart of merit in the meaner class  Arms through the vanity and brainless rage  Of those that bear them in whatever cause  Seem most at variance with all moral good  And incompatible with serious thought  The clown the child of nature without guile  Blest with an insant's ignorance of all  But his own simple pleasures now and then  A wrestling match a footrace or a fair  Is ballotted and trembles at the news  Sheepish he doffs his hat and mumbling swears  A Bibleoath to be whate'er they please  To do he knows not what The task perform'd  That instant he becomes the serjeant's care  His pupil and his torment and his jest  His aukward gait his introverted toes  Bent knees round shoulders and dejected looks  Procure him many a curse By slow degrees  Unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff  He yet by slow degrees puts off himself  Grows conscious of a change and likes it well  He stands erect his slouch becomes a walk  He steps right onward martial in his air  His form and movement is as smart above  As meal and larded locks can make him wears  His hat or his plumed helmet with a grace  And his three years of heroship expired  Returns indignant to the slighted plough  He hates the field in which no fife or drum  Attends him drives his cattle to a march  And sighs for the smart comrades he has left  'Twere well if his exterior change were all  But with his clumsy port the wretch has lost  His ignorance and harmless manners too  To swear to game to drink to shew at home  By lewdness idleness and sabbathbreach  The great proficiency he made abroad  T' astonish and to grieve his gazing friends  To break some maiden's and his mother's heart  To be a pest where he was useful once  Are his sole aim and all his glory now  Man in society is like a flow'r  Bown in its native bed 'Tis there alone  His faculties expanded in full bloom  Shine out there only reach their proper use  But man associated and leagued with man  By regal warrant or selfjoined by bond  For interestsake or swarming into clans  Beneath one head for purposes of war  Like flow'rs selected from the rest and bound  And bundled close to fill some crowded vase  Fades rapidly and by compression marred  Contracts defilement not to be endured  Hence charter'd boroughs are such public plagues  And burghers men immaculate perhaps  In all their private functions once combined  Become a loathsome body only fit  For dissolution hurtful to the main  Hence merchants unimpeachable of sin  Against the charities of domestic life  Incorporated seem at once to Iose  Their nature and disclaiming all regard  For mercy and the common rights of man  Build factories with blood conducting trade  At the sword's point and dying the white robe  Of innocent commercial justice red  Hence too the field of glory as the world  Misdeems it dazzled by its bright array  With all the majesty of its thund'ring pomp  Enchanting music and immortal wreaths  Is but a school where thoughtlessness is taught  On principle where foppery atones  For folly gallantry for ev'ry vice  But slighted as it is and by the great  Abandon'd and which still I more regret  Infected with the manners and the modes  It knew not once the country wins me still  I never fram'd a wish or form'd a plan  That flatter'd me with hopes of earthly bliss  But there I laid the scene There early stray'd  My fancy 'ere yet liberty of choice  Had found me or the hope of being free  My very dreams were rural rural too  The firstborn efforts of my youthful muse  Sportive and jingling her poetic bells  'Ere yet her ear was mistress of their pow'rs  No bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned  To Nature's praises Heroes and their feats  Fatigued me never weary of the pipe  Of Tityrus assembling as he sang  The rustic throng beneath his fav'rite beech  Then Milton had indeed a poet's charms  New to my taste his Paradise surpass'd  The struggling efforts of my boyish tongue  To speak its excellence I danced for joy  I marvel'd much that at so ripe an age  As twice sev'n years his beauties had then first  Engaged my wonder and admiring still  And still admiring with regret supposed  The joy half lost because not sooner found  Thee too enamour'd of the life I loved  Pathetic in its praise in its pursuit  Determined and possessing it at last  With transports such as favor'd lovers feel  I studied prized and wished that I had known  Ingenious Cowley and though now reclaimed  By modern lights from an erroneous taste  I cannot but lament thy splendid wit  Entangled in the cobwebs of the schools  I still revere thee courtly though retired  Though stretch'd at ease in Chertsey's silent bow'rs  Not unemploy'd and finding rich amends  For a lost world in solitude and verse  'Tis born with all The love of Nature's works  Is an ingredient in the compound man  Infused at the creation of the kind  And though th' Almighty Maker has throughout  Discriminated each from each by strokes  And touches of his hand with so much art  Diversified that two were never found  Twins at all pointsyet this obtains in all  That all discern a beauty in his works  And all can taste them Minds that have been form'd  And tutor'd with a relish more exact  But none without some relish none unmoved  It is a flame that dies not even there  Where nothing feeds it Neither business crowds  Nor habits of luxurious citylife  Whatever else they smother of true worth  In human bosoms quench it or abate  The villas with which London stands begirt  Like a swarth Indian with his belt of beads  Prove it A breath of unadult'rate air  The glimpse of a green pasture how they cheer  The citizen and brace his languid frame  Ev'n in the stifling bosom of the town  A garden in which nothing thrives has charms  That sooth the rich possessor much consoled  That here and there some sprigs of mournful mint  Of nightshade or valerian grace the well  He cultivates These serve him with a hint  That Nature lives that sightrefreshing green  Is still the liv'ry she delights to wear  Though sickly samples of th' exub'rant whole  What are the casements lined with creeping herbs  The prouder sashes fronted with a range  Of orange myrtle or the fragrant weed  The Frenchman's  Mignonette  darling are they not all proofs  That man immured in cities still retains  His inborn inextinguishable thirst  Of rural scenes compensating his loss  By supplemental shifts the best he may  The most unfurnished with the means of life  And they that never pass their brickwall bounds  To range the fields and treat their lungs with air  Yet feel the burning instinct overhead  Suspend their crazy boxes planted thick  And water'd duely There the pitcher stands  A fragment and the spoutless teapot there  Sad witnesses how closepent man regrets  The country with what ardour he contrives  A peep at nature when he can no more  Hail therefore patroness of health and ease  And contemplation heartconsoling joys  And harmless pleasures in the throng'd abode  Of multitudes unknown hail rural life  Address himself who will to the pursuit  Of honors or emolument or fame  I shall not add myself to such a chace  Thwart his attempts or envy his success  Some must be great Great offices will have  Great talents And God gives to ev'ry man  The virtue temper understanding taste  That lifts him into life and lets him fall  Just in the niche he was ordain'd to fill  To the deliv'rer of an injured land  He gives a tongue t' enlarge upon an heart  To feel and courage to redress her wrongs  To monarchs dignity to judges sense  To artists ingenuity

with ruddy orb  Ascending fires the horizon While the clouds  That crowd away before the driving wind  More ardent as the disk emerges more  Resemble most some city in a blaze  Seen through the leafless wood His slanting ray  Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale  And tinging all with his own rosy hue  From ev'ry herb and ev'ry spiry blade  Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field  Mine spindling into longitude immense  In spite of gravity and sage remark  That I myself am but a fleeting shade  Provokes me to a smile With eye askance  I view the muscular proportioned limb  Transformed to a lean shank The shapeless pair  As they designed to mock me at my side  Take step for step and as I near approach  The cottage walk along the plaister'd wall  Prepost'rous sight the legs without the man  The verdure of the plain lies buried deep  Beneath the dazzling deluge and the bents  And coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest  Of late unsightly and unseen now shine  Conspicuous and in bright apparel clad  And fledged with icy feathers nod superb  The cattle mourn in corners where the fence  Screens them and seem half petrified to sleep  In unrecumbent sadness There they wait  Their wonted fodder not like hungr'ing man  Fretfull if unsupplied but silent meek  And patient of the slowpaced swain's delay  He from the stack carves out th' accustomed load  Deepplunging and again deep plunging oft  His broad keen knife into the solid mass  Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands  With such undeviating and even force  He severs it away No needless care  Lest storms should overset the leaning pile  Deciduous or its own unbalanced weight  Forth goes the woodman leaving unconcerned  The cheerfull haunts of man to wield the axe  And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear  From morn to eve his solitary task  Shaggy and lean and shrew'd with pointed ears  And tail cropp'd short half lurcher and half cur  His dog attends him Close behind his heel  Now creeps he slow and now with many a frisk  Widescampering snatches up the drifted snow  With iv'ry teeth or ploughs it with his snout  Then shakes his powder'd coat and barks for joy  Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl  Moves right toward the mark Nor stops for aught  But now and then with pressure of his thumb  T' adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube  That fumes beneath his nose The trailing cloud  Streams far behind him scenting all the air  Now from the roost or from the neighb'ring pale  Where diligent to catch the first faint gleam  Of smiling day they gossipp'd side by side  Come trooping at the housewife's wellknown call  The feather'd tribes domestic Half on wing  And half on foot they brush the fleecy flood  Conscious and fearful of too deep a plunge  The sparrows peep and quit the shelt'ring eaves  To seize the fair occasion Well they eye  The scatter'd grain and thievishly resolved  T' escape th' impending famine often scared  As oft return a pert voracious kind  Clean riddance quickly made one only care  Remains to each the search of sunny nook  Or shed impervious to the blast Resign'd  To sad necessity the cock foregoes  His wonted strut and wading at their head  With wellconsidered steps seems to resent  His alter'd gait and stateliness retrenched  How find the myriads that in summer cheer  The hills and vallies with their ceaseless songs  Due sustenance or where subsist they now  Earth yields them nought the imprison'd worm is safe  Beneath the frozen clod all seeds of herbs  Lie covered close and berrybearing thorns  That feed the thrush whatever some suppose  Afford the smaller minstrels no supply  The long protracted rigor of the year  Thins all their num'rous flocks In chinks and holes  Ten thousand seek an unmolested end  As instinct prompts self buried 'ere they die  The very rooks and daws forsake the fields  Where neither grub nor root nor earthnut now  Repays their labor more and perch'd aloft  By the wayside or stalking in the path  Lean pensioners upon the trav'llers track  Pick up their nauscous dole though sweet to them  Of voided pulse or half digested grain  The streams are lost amid the splendid blank  O'erwhelming all distinction On the flood  Indurated and fixt the snowy weight  Lies undissolved while silently beneath  And unperceived the current steals away  Not so where scornful of a check it leaps  The milldam dashes on the wrestless wheel  And wantons in the pebbly gulph below  No frost can bind it there Its utmost force  Can but arrest the light and smokey mist  That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide  And see where it has hung th' embroidered banks  With forms so various that no pow'rs of art  The pencil or the pen may trace the scene  Here glitt'ring turrets rise upbearing high  Fantastic misarrangement on the roof  Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees  And shrubs of fairy land The chrystal drops  That trickle down the branches fast congeal'd  Shoot into pillars of pellucid length  And prop the pile they but adorned before  Here grotto within grotto safe defies  The sunbeam There imboss'd and fretted wild  The growing wonder takes a thousand shapes  Capricious in which fancy seeks in vain  The likeness of some object seen before  Thus nature works as if to mock at art  And in defiance of her rival pow'rs  By these fortuitous and random strokes  Performing such inimitable feats  As she with all her rules can never reach  Less worthy of applause though more admired  Because a novelty the work of man  Imperial mistress of the furclad Russ  Thy most magnificent and mighty freak  The wonder of the North No forest fell  When thou would'st build no quarry sent its stores  T' enrich thy walls But thou didst hew the floods  And make thy marble of the glassy wave  In such a palace Aristaeus found  Cyrene when he bore the plaintive tale  Of his lost bees to her maternal ear  In such a palace poetry might place  The armoury of winter where his troops  The gloomy clouds find weapons arro'wy sleet  Skinpiercing volley blossombruising hail  And snow that often blinds the trav'ller's course  And wraps him in an unexpected tomb  Silently as a dream the fabric rose  No sound of hammer or of saw was there  Ice upon ice the welladjusted parts  Were soon conjoined nor other cement ask'd  Than water interfused to make them one  Lamps gracefully disposed and of all hues  Illumined ev'ry side A wat'ry light  Gleamed through the clear transparency that seemed  Another moon newrisen or meteor fall'n  From heav'n to earth of lambent flame serene  So stood the brittle prodigy though smooth  And slipp'ry the materials yet frostbound  Firm as a rock Nor wanted aught within  That royal residence might well befit  For grandeur or for use Long wavy wreaths  Of flow'rs that feared no enemy but warmth  Blushed on the pannels Mirrour needed none  Where all was vitreous but in order due  Convivial table and commodious seat  What seemed at least commodious seat were there  Sofa and couch and highbuilt throne august  The same lubricity was found in all  And all was moist to the warm touch a scene  Of evanescent glory once a stream  And soon to slide into a stream again  Alas twas but a mortifying stroke  Of undesigned severity that glanced  Made by a monarch on her own estate  On human grandeur and the courts of kings  'Twas transient in its nature as in show  'Twas durable As worthless as it seemed  Intrinsically precious To the foot  Treach'rous and false it smiled and it was cold  Great princes have great playthings Some have played  At hewing mountains into men and some  At building human wonders mountainhigh  Some have amused the dull sad years of life  Life spent in indolence and therefore sad  With schemes of monumental fame and sought  By pyramids and mausolaean pomp  Shortlived themselves t' immortalize their bones  Some seek diversion in the tented field  And make the sorrows of mankind their sport  But war's a game which were their subjects wise  King's should not play at Nations would do well  T' extort their truncheons from the puny hands  Of heroes whose infirm and baby minds  Are gratified with mischief and who spoil  Because men suffer it their toy the world  When Babel was confounded and the great  Confed'racy of projectors wild and vain  Was split into diversity of tongues  Then as a shépherd separates his flock  These to the upland to the valley those  God drave asunder and assigned their lot  To all the nations Ample was the boon  He gave them in its distribution fair  And equal and he bade them dwell in peace  Peace was awhile their care They plough'd and sow'd  And reap'd their plenty without grudge or strife  But violence can never longer sleep  Than human passions please In ev'ry heart  Are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war  Occasion needs but fan them and they blaze  Cain had already shed a brother's blood  The deluge wash'd it out but left unquenched  The seeds of murther in the breast of man  Soon by a righteous judgment in the line  Of his descending progeny was found  The first artificer of death the shrew'd  Contriver who first sweated at the forge  And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel  To a keen edge and made it bright for war  Him Tubal named the Vulcan of old times  The sword and faulchion their inventor claim  And the first smith was the first murd'rer's son  His art survived the waters and 'ere long  When man was multiplied and spread abroad  In tribes and clans and had begun to call  These meadows and that range of hills his own  The tasted sweets of property begat  Desire of more and industry in some  To improve and cultivate their just demesne  Made others covet what they saw so fair  Thus wars began on earth These fought for spoil  And those in selfdefence Savage at first  The onset and irregular At length  One eminent above the rest for strength  For stratagem or courage or for all  Was chosen leader Him they served in war  And him in peace for sake of warlike deeds  Rev'renced no less Who could with him compare  Or who so worthy to controul themselves  As he whose prowess had subdued their foes  Thus war affording field for the display  Of virtue made one chief whom times of peace  Which have their exigencies too and call  For skill in government at length made king  King was a name too proud for man to wear  With modesty and meekness and the crown  So dazzling in their eyes who set it on  Was sure t' intoxicate the brows it bound  It is the abject property of most  That being parcel of the common mass  And destitute of means to raise themselves  They sink and settle lower than they need  They know not what it is to feel within  A comprehensive faculty that grasps  Great purposes with ease that turns and wields  Almost without an effort plans too vast  For their conception which they cannot move  Conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk  With gazing when they see an able man  Step forth to notice and besotted thus  Build him a pedestal and say stand there  And be our admiration and our praise  They roll themselves before him in the dust  Then most deserving in their own account  When most extravagant in his applause  As if exalting him they raised themselves  Thus by degrees selfcheated of their found  And sober judgment that he is but man  They demideify and fume him so  That in due season he forgets it too  Inflated and astrut with selfconceit  He gulps the windy diet and 'ere long  Adopting their mistake profoundly thinks  The world was made in vain if not for him  Thenceforth they are his cattle Drudges born  To bear his burthens drawing in his gears  And sweating in his service His caprice  Becomes the soul that animates them all  He deems a thousand or ten thousand lives  Spent in the purchase of renown for him  An easy reck'ning and they think the same  Thus kings were first invented and thus kings  Were burnished into heroes and became  The arbiters of this terraqueous swamp  Storks among frogs that have but croak'd and died  Strange that such folly as lifts bloated man  To eminence fit only for a God  Should ever drivel out of human lips  Ev'n in the cradled weakness of the world  Still stranger much that when at length mankind  Had reached the sinewy firmness of their youth  And could discriminate and argue well  On subjects more mysterious they were yet  Babes in the cause of freedom and should fear  And quake before the Gods themselves had made  But above measure strange that neither proof  Of sad experience nor examples set  By some whose patriot virtue has prevailed  Can even now when they are grown matute  In wisdom and with philosophic deeps  Familiar serve t' emancipate the rest  Such dupes are men to custom and so prone  To rev'rence what is ancient and can plead  A course of long observance for its use  That even servitude the worst of ills  Because deliver'd down from sire to son  Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing  But is it fit or can it bear the shock  Of rational discussion that a man  Compounded and made up like other men  Of elements tumultuous in whom lust  And folly in as ample measure meet  As in the bosoms of the slaves he rules  Should be a despot absolute and boast  Himself the only freeman of his land  Should when he pleases and on whom he will  Wage war with any or with no pretence  Of provocation giv'n or wrong sustained  And force the beggarly last doit by means  That his own humour dictates from the clutch  Of poverty that thus he may procure  His thousands weary of penurious life  A splendid opportunity to die  Say ye who with less prudence than of old  Jotham ascribed to his assembled trees  In politic convention put your trust  I' th' shadow of a bramble and reclined  In fancied peace beneath his dang'rous branch  Rejoice in him and celebrate his sway  Where find ye passive fortitude Whence springs  Your selfdenying zeal that holds it good  To stroke the prickly grievance and to hang  His thorns with streamers of continual praise  We too are friends to loyalty We love  The king who loves the law respects his bounds  And reigns content within them Him we serve  Freely and with delight who leaves us free  But recollecting still that he is man  We trust him not too far King though he be  And king in England too he may be weak  And vain enough to be ambitious still  May exercise amiss his proper pow'rs  Or covet more than freemen chuse to grant  Beyond that mark is treason He is ours  T' administer to guard t' adorn the state  But not to warp or change it We are his  To serve him nobly in the common cause  True to the death but not to be his slaves  Mark now the diff'rence ye that boast your love  Of kings between your loyalty and ours  We love the man The paultry pageant you  We the chief patron of the Commonwealth  You the regardless author of its woes  We for the sake of liberty a king  You chains and bondage for a tyrant's sake  Our love is principle and has its root  In reason is judicious manly free  Yours a blind instinct crouches to the rod  And licks the foot that treads it in the dust  Were kingship as true treasure as it seems  Sterling and worthy of a wise man's wish  I would not be a king to be beloved  Causeless and daubed with undiscerning praise  Where love is mere attachment to the throne  Not to the man who fills it as he ought  Whose freedom is by suff'rance and at will  Of a superior he is never free  Who lives and is not weary of a life  Exposed to manacles deserves them well  The state that strives for liberty though foiled  And forced t' abandon what she bravely sought  Deserves at least applause for her attempt  And pity for her loss But that's a cause  Not often unsuccessful pow'r usurp'd  Is weakness when oppos'd conscious of wrong  'Tis pusillanimous and prone to flight  But slaves that once conceive the glowing thought  Of freedom in that hope itself possess  All that the contest calls for spirit strength  The scorn of danger and united hearts  The surest presage of the good they seek  The author hopes that he shall not be censured for unnecessary warmth upon so interesting a subject He is aware that it is become almost fashionable to stigmatize such sentiments as no better than empty declamation But it is an ill symptom and peculiar to modern times  Then shame to manhood and opprobrious more  To France than all her losses and defeats  Old or of later date by sea or land  Her house of bondage worse than that of old  Which God avenged on Pharaohthe Bastile  Ye horrid tow'rs th' abode of broken hearts  Ye dungeons and ye cages of despair  That monarchs have supplied from age to age  With music such as suits their sov'reign ears  The sighs and groans of miserable men  There's not an English heart that would not leap  To hear that ye were fall'n at last to know  That ev'n our enemies so oft employed  In forging chains for us themselves were free  For he that values liberty confines  His zeal for her predominance within  No narrow bounds her cause engages him  Wherever pleaded 'Tis the cause of man  There dwell the most forlorn of human kind  Immured though unaccused condemn'd untried  Cruelly spared and hopeless of escape  There like the visionary emblem seen  By him of Babylon life stands a stump  And filletted about with hoops of brass  Still lives though all its pleasant boughs are gone  To count the hourbell and expect no change  And ever as the sullen sound is heard  Still to reflect that though a joyless note  To him whose moments all have one dull pace  Ten thousand rovers in the world at large  Account it music that it summons some  To theatre or jocund feast or ball  The wearied hireling finds it a release  From labor and the lover that has chid  Its long delay feels ev'ry welcome stroke  Upon his heartstrings trembliug with delight  To fly for refuge from distracting thought  To such amusements as ingenious woe  Contrives hardshifting and without her tools  To read engraven on the mouldy walls  In stagg'ring types his predecessors tale  A sad memorial and subjoin his own  To turn purveyor to an overgorged  And bloated spider till the pamper'd pest  Is made familiar watches his approach  Comes at his call and serves him for a friend  To wear out time in numb'ring to and fro  The studs that thick emboss his iron door  Then downward and then upward then aflant  And then alternate with a sickly hope  By dint of change to give his tasteless task  Some relish till the sum exactly found  In all directions he begins again  Oh comfortless existence hemm'd around  With woes which who that suffers would not kneel  And beg for exile or the pangs of death  That man should thus encroach on fellow man  Abridge him of his just and native rights  Eradicate him tear him from his hold  Upon th' endearments of domestic life  And social nip his fruitfulness and use  And doom him for perhaps an heedless word  To barrenness and solitude and tears  Moves indignation Makes the name of king  Of king whom such prerogative can please  As dreadful as the Manichean God  Adored through fear strong only to destroy  'Tis liberty alone that gives the flow'r  Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume  And we are weeds without it All constraint  Except what wisdom lays on evil men  Is evil hurts the faculties impedes  Their progress in the road of science blinds  The eye sight of discov'ry and begets  In those that suffer it a sordid mind  Bestial a meagre intellect unfit  To to be the tenant of man's noble form  Thee therefore still blameworthy as thou art  With all thy lose of empire and though squeezed  By public exigence 'till annual food  Fails for the craving hunger of the state  Thee I account still happy and the chief  Among the nations seeing thou art free  My native nook of earth thy clime is rude  Replete with vapours and disposes much  All hearts to sadness and none more than mine  Thine unadult'rate manners are less soft  And plausible than social life requires  And thou hast need of discipline and art  To give thee what politer France receives  From Nature's bountythat humane address  And sweetness without which no pleasure is  In converse either starved by cold reserve  Or flush'd with fierce dispute a senseless brawl  Yet being free I love thee For the sake  Of that one feature can be well content  Disgraced as thou hast been poor as thou art  To seek no sublunary rest beside  But once enslaved farewell I could endure  Chains no where patiently and chains at home  Where I am free by birthright not at all  Then what were left of roughness in the grain  Of British natures wanting its excuse  That it belongs to freemen would disgust  And shock me I should then with double pain  Feel all the rigor of thy fickle clime  And if I must bewail the blessing lost  For which our Hampdens and our Sidney's bled  I would at least bewail it under skies  Milder among a people less austere  In scenes which having never known me free  Would not reproach me with the loss I felt  Do I forebode impossible events  And tremble at vain dreams Heav'n grant I may  But th' age of virtuous politics is past  And we are deep in that of cold pretence  Patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere  And we too wise to trust them He that takes  Deep in his soft credulity the stamp  Designed by loud declaimers on the part  Of liberty themselves the slaves of lust  Incurs derision for his easy faith  And lack of knowledge and with cause enough  For when was public virtue to be found  Where private was not can he love the whole  Who loves no part He be a nation's friend  Who is in truth the friend of no man there  Can he be strenuous in his country's cause  Who slights the charities for whose dear sake  That country if at all must be beloved  'Tis therefore sober and good men are sad  For England's glory seeing it wax pale  And sickly while her champions wear their hearts  So loose to private duty that no brain  Healthful and undisturbed by factious fumes  Can dream them trusty to the gen'ral weal  Such were not they of old whose temper'd blades  Dispersed the shackles of usurp'd controul  And hew'd them link from link Then Albion's sons  Were sons indeed They felt a filial heart  Beat high within them at a mother's wrongs  And shining each in his domestic sphere  Shone brighter still once call'd to public view  'Tis therefore many whose sequester'd lot  Forbids their interference looking on  Anticipate perforce some dire event  And seeing the old castle of the state  That promised once more firmness so assail'd  That all its tempestbeaten turrets shake  Stand motionless expectants of its fall  All has its date below The fatal hour  Was register'd in heaven 'ere time began  We turn to dust and all our mightiest works  Die too The deep foundations that we lay  Time ploughs them up and not a trace remains  We build with what we deem eternal rock  A distant age asks where the fabric stood  And in the dust sifted and search'd in vain  The undiscoverable secret sleeps  But there is yet a liberty unsung  By poets and by senators unpraised  Which monarchs cannot grant nor all the power  Of earth and hell confed'rate take away  A liberty which persecution fraud  Oppression prisons have no power to bind  Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more  'Tis liberty of heart derived from heav'n  Bought with HIS blood who gave it to mankind  And seal'd with the same token It is held  By charter and that charter sanction'd sure  By th' unimpeachable and awful oath  And promise of a God His other gifts  All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his  And are august but this transcends them all  His other works this visible display  Of allcreating energy and might  Are grand no doubt and worthy of the word  That finding an interminable space  Unoccupied has filled the void so well  And made so sparkling what was dark before  But these are not his glory Man 'tis true  Smit with the beauty of so fair a scene  Might well suppose th' artificer divine  Meant it eternal had he not himself  Pronounced it transient glorious as it is  And still designing a more glorious far  Doom'd it as insufficient for his praise  These therefore are occasional and pass  Form'd for the confutation of the fool  Whose lying heart disputes against a God  That office served they must be swept away  Not so the labours of his love They shine  In other heav'ns than these that we behold  And fade not There is paradise that fears  No forfeiture and of its fruits he sends  Large prelibation oft to saints below  Of these the first in order and the pledge  And confident assurance of the rest  Is liberty A flight into his arms  'Ere yet mortality's fine threads give way  A clear escape from tyrannizing lust  And full immunity from penal woe  Chains are the portion of revolted man  Stripes and a dungeon and his body serves  The triple purpose In that sickly foul  Opprobrious residence he finds them all  Propense his heart to idols he is held  In silly dotage on created things  Careless of their Creator And that low  And sordid gravitation of his pow'rs  To a vile clod so draws him with such force  Resistless from the center he should seek  That he at last forgets it All his hopes  Tend downward his ambition is to sink  To reach a depth profounder still and still  Profounder in the fathomless abyss  Of folly plunging in pursuit of death  But 'ere he gain the comfortless repose  He seeks an acquiescence of his soul  In heav'nrenouncing exile he endures  What does he not from lusts oppos'd in vain  And selfreproaching conscience He foresees  The fatal issue to his health fame peace  Fortune and dignity the loss of all  That can enoble man and make frail life  Short as it is supportable Still worse  Far worse than all the plagues with which his sins  Infect his happiest moments he forebodes  Ages of hopeless misery Future death  And death still future Not an hasty stroke  Like that which sends him to the dusty grave  But unrepealable enduring death  Scripture is still a trumpet to his fears  What none can prove a forg'ry may be true  What none but bad men wish exploded must  That scruple checks him Riot is not loud  Nor drunk enough to drown it In the midst  Of laughter his compunctions are sincere  And he abhors the jest by which he shines  Remorse begets reform His masterlust  Falls first before his resolute rebuke  And seems dethroned and vanquish'd Peace ensues  But spurious and shortliv'd the puny child  Of selfcongratulating pride begot  On fancied Innocence Again he falls  And fights again but finds his best essay  A presage ominous

renown  They had indeed ability to smooth  The shag of savage nature and were each  An Orpheus and omnipotent in song  But transformation of apostate man  From fool to wise from earthly to divine  Is

give in charge  Their names to the sweet lyre Th' historic muse  Proud of the treasure marches with it down  To latest times and sculpture in her turn  Gives bond in stone and everduring brass  To

strife may earn indeed  And for a time insure to his loved land  The sweets of liberty and equal laws  But martyrs struggle for a brighter prize  And win it with more pain Their blood is shed  In confirmation of the noblest claim  Our claim to feed upon immortal truth  To walk with God to be divinely free  To soar and to anticipate the skies  Yet few remember them They lived unknown  Till

are slaves beside There's not a chain  That hellish foes confed'rate for his harm  Can wind around him but he casts it off  With as much ease as Samson his green wyths  He looks abroad into the varied field  Of Nature and though poor perhaps compared  With those whose mansions glitter in his sight  Calls the delightful scen'ry all his own  His are the mountains and the vallies his  And the

riot but ye will not find  In feast or in the chace in song or dance  A liberty like his who unimpeach'd  Of usurpation and to no man's wrong  Appropriates nature as his father's work  And has a richer use of yours than you  He is indeed a freeman Free by birth  Of no mean city plann'd or 'ere the hills  Were built the fountains open'd or the sea  With all his roaring multitude of waves  His freedom is the same in ev'ry state  And no condition of this changeful life  So manifold in cares whose ev'ry day  Brings its own evil with it makes it less  For he has wings that neither sickness pain  Nor penury can cripple or confine  No nook so narrow but he spreads them there  With ease and is at large Th' oppressor holds  His body bound but knows not what a range  His spirit takes unconscious of a chain  And that to bind him is a vain attempt  Whom God delights in and in whom he dwells  Acquaint thyself with God if thou would'st taste  His works Admitted once to his embrace  Thou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before  Thine eye shall be instructed and thine heart  Made pure shall relish with divine delight  'Till then unfelt what hands divine have wrought  Brutes

Thou hast built  With means that were not till by thee employ'd  World's that had never been had'st thou in strength  Been less or less benevolent than strong  They are thy witnesses who speak thy pow'r  And goodness infinite but speak in ears  That hear not or receive not their report  In vain thy creatures testify of thee  'Till thou proclaim thyself Their's is indeed  A teaching voice but 'tis the praise of thine  That whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn  And with the boon gives talents for its use  'Till thou art heard imaginations vain  Possess the heart and fables false as hell

ear is pleas'd  With melting airs or martial brisk or grave  Some chord in unison with what we hear  Is touched within us and the heart replies  How soft the music of those village bells  Falling at intervals upon the ear  In cadence sweet now dying all away  Now pealing loud again and louder still  Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on  With easy force it opens all the cells  Where mem'ry slept Wherever I have heard  A kindred melody the scene recurs  And with it all its pleasures and its pains  Such comprehensive views the spirit takes  That in a few short moments I retrace  As in a map the voyager his course  The windings of my way through many years  Short as in retrospect the journey seems  It seem'd not always short the rugged path  And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn  Moved many a sigh at its disheart'ning length  Yet feeling present evils while the past  Faintly impress the mind or not at all  How readily we wish time spent revoked  That we might try the ground again where once  Through inexperience as we now perceive  We miss'd that happiness we might have found  Some friend is gone perhaps his son's best friend  A father whose authority in show  When most severe and must'ring all its force  Was but the graver countenance of love  Whose favour like the clouds of spring might low'r  And utter now and then an awful voice  But had a blessing in its darkest frown  Threat'ning at once and nourishing the plant  We loved but not enough the gentle hand  That reared us At a thoughtless age allured  By ev'ry gilded folly we renounced  His shelt'ring side and wilfully forewent  That converse which we now in vain regret  How gladly would the man recall to life  The boy's neglected sire a mother too  That softer friend perhaps more gladly still  Might he demand them at the gates of death  Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed  The playful humour he could now endure  Himself grown sober in the vale of tears  And feel a parent's presence no restraint  But not to understand a treasure's worth  'Till time has stol'n away the slighted good  Is cause of half the poverty we feel  And makes the world the wilderness it is  The few that pray at all pray oft amiss  And seeking grace t' improve the prize they hold  Would urge a wiser suit than asking more  The night was winter in his roughest mood  The morning sharp and clear But now at noon  Upon the southern side of the slant hills  And where the woods fence off the northern blast  The season smiles resigning all its rage  And has the warmth of May The vault is blue  Without a cloud and white without a speck  The dazzling splendour of the scene below  Again the harmony comes o'er the vale  And through the trees I view th' embattled tow'r  Whence all the music I again perceive  The soothing influence of the wafted strains  And settle in soft musings as I tread  The walk still verdant under oaks and elms  Whose outspread branches overarch the glade  The roof though moveable through all its length  As the wind sways it has yet well sufficed  And intercepting in their silent fall  The frequent flakes has kept a path for me  No noise is here or none that hinders thought  The redbreast warbles still but is content  With slender notes and more than half suppress'd  Pleased with his solitude and flitting light  From spray to spray where'er he rests he shakes  From many a twig the pendent drops of ice  That tinkle in the wither'd leaves below  Stillness accompanied with sounds so soft  Charms more than silence Meditation here  May think down hours to moments Here the heart  May give an useful lesson to the head  And learning wiser grow without his books  Knowledge and wisdom far from being one  Have oft times no connexion Knowledge dwells  In heads replete with thoughts of other men  Wisdom in minds attentive to their own  Knowledge a rude unprofitable mass  The mere materials with which wisdom builds  'Till smooth'd and squared and fitted to its place  Does but incumber whom it seems t' enrich  Knowledge is proud that he has learn'd so much  Wisdom is humble that he knows no more  Books are not seldom talismans and spells  By which the magic art of shrewder wits  Holds an unthinking multitude enthrall'd  Some to the fascination of a name  Surrender judgment hoodwink'd Some the stile  Infatuates and through labyrinths and wilds  Of error leads them by a tune entranced  While sloth seduces more too weak to bear  The insupportable fatigue of thought  And swallowing therefore without pause or choice  The total grist unsifted husks and all  But trees and rivulets whose rapid course  Defies the check of winter haunts of deer  And sheepwalks populous with bleating lambs  And lanes in which the primrose 'ere her time  Peeps through the moss that cloaths the hawthorn root  Deceive no student Wisdom there and truth  Not shy as in the world and to be won  By slow solicitation seize at once  The roving thought and fix it on themselves  What prodigies can pow'r divine perform  More grand than it produces year by year  And all in sight of inattentive man  Familiar with th' effect we slight the cause  And in the constancy of nature's course  The regular return of genial months  And renovation of a faded world  See nought to wonder at Should God again  As once in Gibeon interrupt the race  Of the undeviating and punctual sun  How would the world admire but speaks it less  An agency divine to make him know  His moment when to sink and when to rise  Age after age than to arrest his course  All we behold is miracle but seen  So duly all is miracle in vain  Where now the vital energy that moved  While summer was the pure and subtle lymph  Through th' imperceptible maeandring veins  Of leaf and flow'r It sleeps and the icy touch  Of unprolific winter has impress'd  A cold stagnation on th' intestine tide  But let the months go round a few short months  And all shall be restored These naked shoots  Barren as lances among which the wind  Makes wintry music sighing as it goes  Shall put their graceful foliage on again  And more aspiring and with ampler spread  Shall boast new charms and more than they have lost  Then each in its peculiar honors clad  Shall publish even to the distant eye  Its family and tribe Laburnum rich  In streaming gold syringa iv'rypure  The scented and the scentless rose this red  And of an humbler growth the  The Guelderro    other tall  And throwing up into the darkest gloom  Of neighb'ring cypress or more sable yew  Her silver globes light as the foamy surf  That the wind severs from the broken wave  The lilac various in array now white  Now sanguine and her beauteous head now set  With purple spikes pyramidal as if  Studious of ornament yet unresolved  Which hue she most approved she chose them all  Copious of flow'rs the woodbine pale and wan  But well compensating their sickly looks  With nevercloying odours early and late  Hypericum all bloom so thick a swarm  Of flow'rs like flies cloathing her slender rods  That scarce a leaf appears Mezerion too  Though leafless well attired and thick beset  With blushing wreaths investing ev'ry spray  Althaea with the purple eye the broom  Yellow and bright as bullion unalloy'd  Her blossoms and luxuriant above all  The jasmine throwing wide her elegant sweets  The deep dark green of whose unvarnish'd leaf  Makes more conspicuous and illumines more  The bright profusion of her scatter'd stars  These have been and these shall be in their day  And all this uniform uncoloured scene  Shall be dismantled of its fleecy load  And flush into variety again  From dearth to plenty and from death to life  Is Nature's progress when she lectures man  In heav'nly truth evincing as she makes  The grand transition that there lives and works  A soul in all things and that soul is God  The beauties of the wilderness are his  That make so gay the solitary place  Where no eye sees them And the fairer forms  That cultivation glories in are his  He sets the bright procession on its way  And marshals all the order of the year  He marks the bounds which winter may not pass  And blunts his pointed fury In its case  Russet and rude folds up the tender germ  Uninjured with inimitable art  And 'ere one flow'ry season fades and dies  Designs the blooming wonders of the next  Some say that in the origin of things  When all creation started into birth  The infant elements received a law  From which they swerve not since That under force  Of that controuling ordinance they move  And need not his immediate hand who first  Prescribed their course to regulate it now  Thus dream they and contrive to save a God  The incumbrance of his own concerns and spare  The great Artificer of all that moves  The stress of a continual act the pain  Of  itted vigilance and care  laborious and severe a task  the moth is not afraid it seems  Omnipotence and measure might  That knows no measure by the scanty rule  And standard of his own that is to day  And is not 'ere tomorrow's sun go down  But how should matter occupy a charge  as it is and satisfy a law  So vast in its demands unless impell'd  easeless service by a ceaseless force  And under pressure of some conscious cause  The Lord of all himself through all diffused  Sustains and is the life of all that lives  Nature is but a name for an effect  Whose cause is God He feeds the secret fire  By which the mighty process is maintain'd  Who sleeps not is not weary in whose sight  Slowcircling ages are as transient days  Whose work is without labor whose design  No flaw deforms no difficulty thwarts  And whose beneficence no charge exhausts  Him blind antiquity profaned not serv'd  With selftaught rites and under various names  Female and male Pomona Pales Pan  And Flora and Vertumnus peopling earth  With tutelary goddesses and gods  That were not and commending as they would  To each some province garden field or grove  But all are under one One spiritHis  Who wore the platted thorns with bleeding brows  Rules universal nature Not a flow'r  But shows some touch in freckle streak or stain  Of his unrivall'd pencil He inspires  Their balmy odors and imparts their hues  And bathes their eyes with nectar and includes  In grains as countless as the seaside sands  The forms with which he sprinkles all the earth  Happy who walks with him whom what he finds  Of flavour or of scent in fruit or flow'r  Or what he views of beautiful or grand  In Nature from the broad majestic oak  To the green blade that twinkles in the fun  Prompts with remembrance of a present God  His presence who made all so fair perceived  Makes all still fairer As with him no scene  Is dreary so with him all seasons please  Though winter had been none had man been true  And earth be punished for its tenant's sake  Yet not in vengeance as this smiling sky  So soon succeeding such an angry night  And these dissolving snows and this clear stream  Recov'ring fast its liquid music prove  Who then that has a mind well strung and tuned  To contemplation and within his reach  A scene so friendly to his fav'rite task  Would waste attention at the chequer'd board  His host of wooden warriors to and fro  Marching and countermarching with an eye  As fixt as marble with a forehead ridged  And furrow'd into storms and with a hand  Trembling as if eternity were hung  In balance on his conduct of a pin  Nor envies he aught more their idle sport  Who pant with application misapplied  To trivial toys and pushing iv'ry balls  Across the velvet level feel a joy  Akin to rapture when the bawble finds  Its destin'd goal of difficult access  Nor deems he wiser him who gives his noon  To Miss the Mercer's plague from shop to shop  Wand'ring and litt'ring with unfolded silks  The polished counter and approving none  Or promising with smiles to call again  Nor him who by his vanity seduced  And sooth'd into a dream that he discerns  The difference of a Guido from a daub  Frequents the crowded auction Station'd there  As duely as the Langford of the show  With glass at eye and catalogue in hand  And tongue accomplish'd in the fulsome cant  And pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease  Oft as the pricedeciding hammer falls  He notes it in his book then raps his box  Swears 'tis a bargain rails at his hard fate  That he has let it passbut never bids  Here unmolefted through whatever sign  The sun proceeds I wander Neither mist  Nor freezing sky nor sultry checking me  Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy  Ev'n in the spring and playtime of the year  That calls the unwonted villager abroad  With all her little ones a sportive train  To gather kingcups in the yellow mead  And prink their hair with daisies or to pick  A cheap but wholesome sallad from the brook  These shades are all my own The tim'rous hare  Grown so familiar with her frequent guest  Scarce shuns me and the stock dove unalarm'd  Sits cooing in the pinetree nor suspends  His long loveditty for my near approach  Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm  That age or injury has hollow'd deep  Where on his bed of wool and matted leaves  He has outslept the winter ventures forth  To frisk awhile and bask in the warm sun  The squirrel flippant pert and full of play  He sees me and at once swift as a bird  Ascends the neighb'ring beech there whisks his brush  And perks his ears and stamps and scolds aloud  With all the prettiness of feign'd alarm  And anger insignificantly fierce  The heart is hard in nature and unfit  For human fellowship as being void  Of sympathy and therefore dead alike  To love and friendship both that is not pleased  With sight of animals enjoying life  Nor feels their happiness augment his own  The bounding fawn that darts across the glade  When none pursues through mere delight of heart  And spirits buoyant with excess of glee  The horse as wanton and almost as fleet  That skims the spacious meadow at full speed  Then stops and snorts and throwing high his heels  Starts to the voluntary race again  The very kine that gambol at high noon  The total herd receiving first from one  That leads the dance a summons to be gay  Though wild their strange vagaries and uncouth  Their efforts yet resolved with one consent  To give such act and utt'rance as they may  To extasy too big to be suppress'd  These and a thousand images of bliss  With which kind nature graces ev'ry scene  Where cruel man defeats not her design  Impart to the benevolent who wish  All that are capable of pleasure pleased  A far superior happiness to theirs  The comfort of a reasonable joy  Man scarce had ris'n obedient to his call  Who form'd him from the dust his future grave  When he was crown'd as never king was since  God set the diadem upon his head  And angel choirs attended Wond'ring stood  The newmade monarch while before him pass'd  All happy and all perfect in their kind  The creatures summon'd from their various haunts  To see their sov'reign and confess his sway  Vast was his empire absolute his pow'r  Or bounded only by a law whose force  'Twas his sublimest privilege to feel  And own the law of universal love  He ruled with meekness they obeyed with joy  No cruel purpose lurk'd within his heart  And no distrust of his intent in theirs  So Eden was a scene of harmless sport  Where kindness on his part who ruled the whole  Begat a tranquil confidence in all  And fear as yet was not nor cause for fear  But sin marr'd all And the revolt of man  That source of evils not exhausted yet  Was punish'd with revolt of his from him  Garden of God how terrible the change  Thy groves and lawns then witness'd ev'ry heart  Each animal of ev'ry name conceived  A jealousy and an instinctive fear  And conscious of some danger either fled  Precipitate the loath'd abode of man  Or growl'd defiance in such angry sort  As taught him too to tremble in his turn  Thus harmony and family accord  Were driv'n from Paradise and in that hour  The seeds of cruelty that since have swell'd  To such gigantic and enormous growth  Were sown in human nature's fruitful soil  Hence date the persecution and the pain  That man inflicts on all inferior kinds  Regardless of their plaints To make him sport  To gratify the frenzy of his wrath  Or his base gluttony are causes good  And just in his account why bird and beast  Should suffer torture and the streams be dyed  With blood of their inhabitants impaled  Earth groans beneath the burthen of a war  Waged with defenceless innocence while he  Not satisfied to prey on all around  Adds tenfold bitterness to death by pangs  Needless and first torments 'ere he devours  Now happiest they that occupy the scenes  The most remote from his abhorr'd resort  Whom once as delegate of God on earth  They fear'd and as his perfect image loved  The wilderness is theirs with all its caves  Its hollow glenns its thickets and its plains  Unvisited by man There they are free  And howl and roar as likes them uncontroul'd  Nor ask his leave to slumber or to play  Woe to the tyrant if he dare intrude  Within the confines of their wild domain  The lion tells himI am monarch here  And if he spare him spares him on the terms  Of royal mercy and through gen'rous scorn  To rend a victim trembling at his foot  In measure as by force of instinct drawn  Or by necessity constrain'd they live  Dependent upon man those in his fields  These at his crib and some beneath his roof  They prove too often at how dear a rate  He sells protection Witness at his foot  The spaniel dying for some venial fault  Under dissection of the knotted scourge  Witness the patient ox with stripes and yells  Driv'n to the slaughter goaded as he runs  To madness while the savage at his heels  Laughs at the frantic suff'rers fury spent  Upon the guiltless passenger o'erthrown  He too is witness noblest of the train  That wait on man the flightperforming horse  With unsuspecting readiness he takes  His murth'rer on his back and push'd all day  With bleeding sides and flanks that heave for life  To the fardistant goal arrives and dies  So little mercy shows who needs so much  Does law so jealous in the cause of man  Denounce no doom on the delinquent None  He lives and o'er his brimming beaker boasts  As if barbarity were high desert  Th' inglorious feat and clamorous in praise  Of the poor brute seems wisely to suppose  The honors of his matchless horse his own  But many a crime deem'd innocent on earth  Is register'd in heav'n and these no doubt  Have each their record with a curse annext  Man may dismiss compassion from his heart  But God will never When he charged the Jew  T' assist his foe's downfallen beast to rise  And when the bushexploring boy that seized  The young to let the parent bird go free  Proved he not plainly that his meaner works  Are yet his care and have an interest all  All in the universal father's love  On Noah and in him on all mankind  The charter was conferr'd by which we hold  The flesh of animals in fee and claim  O'er all we feed on pow'r of life and death  But read the instrument and mark it well  Th' oppression of a tyrannous controul  Can find no warrant there Feed then and yield  Thanks for thy food Carnivorous through sin  Feed on the slain but spare the living brute  The Governor of all himself to all  So bountiful in whose attentive ear  The unfledged raven and the lion's whelp  Plead not in vain for pity on the pangs  Of hunger unassuaged has interposed  Not seldom his avenging arm to smite  Th' injurious trampler upon nature's law  That claims forbearance even for a brute  He hates the hardness of a Balaam's heart  And prophet as he was he might not strike  The blameless animal without rebuke  On which he rode Her opportune offence  Saved him or th' unrelenting seer had died  He sees that human equity is slack  To interfere though in so just a cause  And makes the task his own Inspiring dumb  And helpless victims with a sense so keen  Of injury with such knowledge of their strength  And such sagacity to take revenge  That oft the beast has seemed to judge the man  An ancient not a legendary tale  By

moment's fear in me  Mark now the proof I give thee that the brave  Need no such aids as superstition lends  To steel their hearts against the dread of death  He spoke and to the precipice at hand  Push'd with a madman's fury Fancy shrinks  And the blood thrills and curdles at the thought  Of such a gulph as he design'd his grave  But though the felon on his back could dare  The dreadful leap more rational his steed  Declined the death and wheeling swiftly round  Or 'ere his hoof had press'd the crumbling verge  Baffled his rider saved against his will  The frenzy of the brain may be redress'd  By med'cine well applied but without grace  The heart's insanity admits no cure  Enraged the more by what might have reform'd  His horrible intent again he sought  Destruction with a zeal to be destroyed  With sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood  But still in vain The providence that meant  A longer date to the far nobler beast  Spared yet again th' ignobler for his sake  And now his prowess proved and his sincere  Incurable obduracy evinced  His rage grew cool and pleased perhaps t' have earn'd  So cheaply the renown of that attempt  With looks of some complacence he resumed  His road deriding much the blank amaze  Of good Evander still where he was left  Fixt motionless and petrified with dread  So on they fared discourse on other themes  Ensuing seem'd to obliterate the past  And tamer far for so much fury shown  As is the course of rash and fiery men  The rude companion smiled as if transform'd  But 'twas a transient calm A storm was near  An unsuspected storm His hour was come  The impious challenger of pow'r divine  Was now to learn that heav'n though slow to wrath  Is never with impunity defied  His horse as he had caught his master's mood  Snorting and starting into sudden rage  Unbidden and not now to be controul'd  Rush'd to the cliff and having reach'd it stood  At once the shock unseated him He flew  Sheer o'er the craggy barrier and immersed  Deep in the flood found when he sought it not  The death he had deserved and died alone  So God wrought double justice made the fool  The victim of his own tremendous choice  And taught a brute the way to safe revenge  I would not enter on my list of friends  Though grac'd with polish'd manners and fine sense  Yet wanting sensibility the man  Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm  An inadvertent step may crush the snail  That crawls at evening in the public path  But he that has humanity forewarned  Will tread aside and let the reptile live  The creeping vermin loathsome to the sight  And charged perhaps with venom that intrudes  A visitor unwelcome into scenes  Sacred to neatness and repose th' alcove  The chamber or refectory may die  A necessary act incurs no blame  Not so when held within their proper bounds  And guiltless of offence they range the air  Or take their pastime in the spacious field  There they are privileged And he that hunts  Or harms them there is guilty of a wrong  Disturbs th' oeconomy of nature's realm  Who when she form'd designed them an abode  The sum is this if man's convenience health  Or safety interfere his rights and claims  Are paramount and must extinguish theirs  Else they are allthe meanest things that are  As free to live and to enjoy that life  As God was free to form them at the first  Who in his sov'reign wisdom made them all  Ye therefore who love mercy teach your sons  To love it too The springtime of our years  Is soon dishonour'd and defiled in most  By budding ills that ask a prudent hand  To check them But alas none sooner shoots  If unrestrain'd into luxuriant growth  Than cruelty most dev'lish of them all  Mercy to him that shows it is the rule  And righteous limitation of its act  By which heav'n moves in pard'ning guilty man  And he that shows none being ripe in years  And conscious of the out'rage he commits  Shall seek it and not find it in his turn  Distinguish'd much by reason and still more  By our capacity of grace divine  From creatures that exist but for our sake  Which having served us perish we are held  Accountable and God some future day  Will reckon with us roundly for th' abuse  Of what he deems no mean or trivial trust  Superior as we are they yet depend  Not more on human help than we on theirs  Their strength or speed or vigilance were giv  In aid of our defects In some are found  Such teachable and apprehensive parts  That man's attainments in his own concerns  Match'd with th' expertness of the brutes in theirs  Are ofttimes vanquish'd and thrown far behind  Some show that nice sagacity of smell  And read with such discernment in the ports  And figure of the man his secret aim  That oft we owe our safety to a skill  We could not teach and must despair to learn  But learn we might if not too proud to stoop  To quadrupede instructors many a good  And useful quality and virtue too  Rarely exemplified among ourselves  Attachment never to be wean'd or changed  By any change of fortune proof alike  Against unkindness absence and neglect  Fidelity that neither bribe nor threat  Can move or warp and gratitude for small  And trivial favors lasting as the life  And glist'ning even in the dying eye  Man praises man Desert in arts or arms  Wins public honor and ten thousand sit  Patiently present at a sacred song  Commemorationmad content to hear  Oh wonderful effect of music's pow'r  Mussiah's eulogy for Handel's sake  But less methinks than sacrilege might serve  For was it less What heathen would have dared  To strip Jove's statue of his oaken wreath  And hang it up in honor of a man  Much less might serve when all that we design  Is but to gratify an itching ear  And give the day to a musician's praise  Remember Handel who that was not born  Deaf as the dead to harmony forgets  Or can the more than Homer of his age  Yeswe remember him And while we praise  A talent so divine remember too  That His most holy book from whom it came  Was never meant was never used before  To buckram out the mem'ry of a man  But hushthe muse perhaps is too severe  And with a gravity beyond the size  And measure of th' offence rebukes a deed  Less impious than absurd and owing more  To want of judgment than to wrong design  So in the chapel of old Ely House  When wand'ring Charles who meant to be the third  Had fled from William and the news was fresh  The simple clerk but loyal did announce  And eke did rear right merrily two staves  Sung to the praise and glory of King George  Man praises man and Garrick's mem'ry next  When time hath somewhat mellow'd it and made  The idol of our worship while he lived  The God of our idolatry once more  Shall have its altar and the world shall go  In pilgrimage to bow before his shrine  The theatre too small shall suffocate  Its squeezed contents and more than it admits  Shall sigh at their exclusion and return  Ungratified For there some noble lord  Shall stuff his shoulders with king Richard's bunch  Or wrap himself in Hamlet's inky cloak  And strut and storm and straddle stamp and stare  The show the world how Garrick did not act  For Garrick was a worshipper himself  He drew the Liturgy and framed the rites  And solemn ceremonial of the day  And call'd the world to worship on the banks  Of Avon famed in song Ah pleasant proof  That piety has still in human hearts  Some place a spark or two not yet extinct  The mulb'ry tree was hung with blooming wreaths  The mulb'ry tree stood center of the dance  The mulb'ry tree was hymn'd with dulcet airs  And from his touchwood trunk the mulb'ry tree  Supplied such relics as devotion holds  Still sacred and preserves with pious care  So 'twas an hallow'd time Decorum reign'd  And mirth without offence No few return'd  Doubtless much edified and all refreshed  Man praises man The rabble all alive  From tiplingbenches cellars stalls and styes  Swarm in the streets The statesman of the day  A pompous and slowmoving pageant comes  Some shout him and some hang upon his car  To gaze in's eyes and bless him Maidens wave  Their 'kerchiefs and old women weep for joy  While others not so satisfied unhorse  The gilded equipage and turning loose  His streeds usurp a place they well deserve  Why what has charm'd them Hath he saved the state  No Doth he purpose its salvation No  Inchanting novelty that moon at full  That finds out ev'ry crevice of the head  That is not sound and perfect hath in theirs  Wrought this disturbance But the wane is near  And his own cattle must suffice him soon  Thus idly do we waste the breath of praise  And dedicate a tribute in its use  And just direction sacred to a thing  Doomed to the dust or lodged already there  Encomium in old time was poet's work  But poets having lavishly long since  Exhausted all materials of the art  The task now falls into the public hand  And I contented with an humble theme  Have poured my stream of panegyric down  The vale of nature where it creeps and winds  Among her lovely works with a secure  And unambitious course reflecting clear  If not the virtues yet the worth of brutes  And I am recompensed and deem the toils  Of poetry not lost if verse of mine  May stand between an animal and woe  And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge  The groans of nature in this nether world  Which heav'n has heard for ages have an end  Foretold by prophets and by poets sung  Whose fire was kindled at the prophets lamp  The time of rest the promised sabbath comes  Six thousand years of sorrow have wellnigh  Fulfilled their tardy and disastrous course  Over a sinful world And what remains  Of this tempestuous state of human things  Is merely as the working of a sea  Before a calm that rocks itself to rest  For he whose car the winds are and the clouds  The dust that waits upon his sultry march  When sin hath moved him and his wrath is hot  Shall visit earth in mercy shall descend  Propitious in his chariot paved with love  And what his storms have blasted and defaced  For man's revolt shall with a smile repair  Sweet is the harp of prophesy Too sweet  Not to be wrong'd by a mere mortal touch  Nor can the wonders it records be sung  To meaner music and not suffer loss  But when a poet or when one like me  Happy to rove among poetic flow'rs  Though poor in skill to rear them lights at last  On some sair theme some theme divinely fair  Such is the impulse and the spur he feels  To give it praise proportioned to its worth  That not t' attempt it arduous as he deems  The labor were a task more arduous still  Oh scenes surpassing fable and yet true  Scenes of accomplish'd bliss which who can see  Though but in distant prospect and not feel  His soul refresh'd with foretaste of the joy  Rivers of gladness water all the earth  And clothe all climes with beauty the reproach  Of barreness is past The fruitful field  Laughs with abundance and the land once lean  Or fertile only in its own disgrace  Exults to see its thistly curse repealed  The various seasons woven into one  And that one season an eternal spring  The garden fears no blight and needs no fence  For there is none to covet all are full  The lion and the libbard and the bear  Graze with the fearless siocks All bask at noon  Together or all gambol in the shade  Of the same grove and drink one common stream  Antipathies are none No foe to man  Lurks in the serpent now The mother sees  And smiles to see her infant's playful hand  Stretch'd forth to dally with the crested worm  To stroak his azure neck or to receive  The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue  All creatures worship man and all mankind  One Lord one Father Error has no place  That creeping pestilence is driv'n away  The breath of heav'n has chased it In the heart  No passion touches a discordant string  But all is harmony and love Disease  Is not The pure and uncontaminate blood  Holds its due course nor fears the frost of age  One song employs all nations and all cry  "Worthy the Lamb for he was slain for us"  The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks  Shout to each other and the mountain tops  From distant mountains catch the flying joy  'Till nation after nation taught the strain  Earth rolls the rapturous Hosanna round  Behold the measure of the promise filled  See Salem built the labour of a God  Bright as a sun the sacred city shines  All kingdoms and all princes of the earth  Flock to that light the glory of all lands  Flows into her unbounded is her joy  And endless her encrease Thy rams are there  Nebaioth and Kedar the sons of Ishamael and progenitors of the Arabs in the prophetic scripture here alluded to may be reasonably considered as representatives of the Gentiles at large  Nebaioth and the flocks of Kedar there  The looms of Ormus and the mines of Ind  And Saba's spicey groves pay tribute there  Praise is in all her gates Upon her walls  And in her streets and in her spacious courts  Is heard salvation Eastern Java there  Kneels with the native of the farthest West  And Aethiopia spreads abroad the hand  And worships Her report has travell'd forth  Into all lands From every clime they come  To see thy beauty and to share thy joy  O Sion an assembly such as earth  Saw never such as heav'n stoops down to see  Thus heav'nward all things tend For all were once  Perfect and all must be at length restored  So God has greatly purposed who would else  In his dishonoured works himself endure  Dishonor and be wrong'd without redress  Haste then and wheel away a shatter'd world  Ye slowrevolving seasons we would see  A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet  A world that does not dread and hate his laws  And suffer for its crime Would learn how fair  The creature is that God pronounces good  How pleasant in itself what pleases him  Here ev'ry drop of honey hides a sting  Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flow'rs  And ev'n the joy that haply some poor heart  Derives from heav'n pure as the fountain is  Is sullied in the stream taking a taint  From touch of human lips at best impure  Oh for a world in principle as chaste  As this is gross and selfish over which  Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway  That govern all things here should'ring aside  The meek and modest truth and forcing her  To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife  In nooks obscure far from the ways of men  Where violence shall never lift the sword  Nor cunning justify the proud man's wrong  Leaving the poor no remedy but tears  Where he that fills an office shall esteem  Th' occasion it presents of doing good  More than the perquisite Where law shall speak  Seldom and never but as wisdom prompts  And equity not jealous more to guard  A worthless form than to decide aright  Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse  Nor smooth goodbreeding supplemental grace  With lean performance ape the work of love  Come then and added to thy many crowns  Receive yet one the crown of all the earth  Thou who alone art worthy it was thine  By antient covenant 'ere nature's birth  And thou hast made it thine by purchase since  And overpaid its value with thy blood  Thy saints proclaim thee king and in their hearts  Thy title is engraven with a pen  Dipt in the fountain of eternal love  Thy saints proclaim thee king and thy delay  Gives courage to their foes who could they see  The dawn of thy last advent longdesired  Would creep into the bowels of the hills  And flee for safety to the falling rocks  The very spirit of the world is tired  Of its own taunting question ask'd so long  "Where is the promise of your Lord's approach"  The infidel has shot his bolts away  'Till his exhausted quiver yielding none  He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled  And aims them at the shield of truth again  The veil is rent rent too by priestly hands  That hides divinity from mortal eyes  And all the mysteries to faith proposed  Insulted and traduced are cast aside  As useless to the moles and to the bats  They now are deem'd the faithful and are praised  Who constant only in rejecting thee  Deny thy Godhead with a martyr's zeal  And quit their office for their errors sake  Blind and in love with darkness yet ev'n these  Worthy compared with sycophants who knee  Thy name adoring and then preach thee man  So fares thy church But how thy church may fare  The world takes little thought who will may preach  And what they will All pastors are alike  To wand'ring sheep resolved to follow none  Two gods divide them all pleasure and gain  For these they live they sacrifice to these  And in their service wage perpetual war  With conscience and with thee Lust in their hearts  And mischief in their hands they roam the earth  To prey upon each other stubborn fierce  Highminded foaming out their own disgrace  Thy prophets speak of such and noting down  The features of the last degen'rate times  Exhibit ev'ry lineament of these  Come then and added to thy many crowns  Receive yet one as radiant as the rest  Due to thy last and most effectual work  Thy word fulfilled the conquest of a world  He is the happy man whose life ev'n now  Shows somewhat of that happier life to come  Who doomed to an obscure but tranquil state  Is pleased with it and were he free to chuse  Would make his fate his choice Whom peace the fruit  Of virtue and whom virtue fruit of faith  Prepare for happiness bespeak him one  Content indeed to sojourn while he must  Below the skies but having there his home  The world o'erlooks him in her busy search  Of objects more illustrious in her view  And occupied as earnestly as she  Though more sublimely he o'erlooks the world  She scorns his pleasures for she knows them not  He seeks not hers for he has proved them vain  He cannot skim the ground like summer birds  Pursuing gilded flies and such he deems  Her honors her emoluments her joys  Therefore in contemplation is his bliss  Whose pow'r is such that whom she lifts from earth  She makes familiar with a heav'n unseen  And shows him glories yet to be revealed  Not slothful he though seeming unemployed  And censured oft as useless Stillest streams  Oft water fairest meadows and the bird  That flutters least is longest on the wing  Ask him indeed what trophies he has raised  Or what atchievements of immortal fame  He purposes and he shall answernone  His warfare is within There unfatigued  His fervent spirit labors There he fights  And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself  And neverwith'ring wreaths compared with which  The laurels that a Caesar reaps are weeds  Perhaps the selfapproving haughty world  That as she sweeps him with her whistling silks  Scarce deigns to notice him or if she see  Deems him a cypher in the works of God  Receives advantage from his noiseless hours  Of which she little dreams Perhaps she owes  Her sunshine and her rain her blooming spring  And plenteous harvest to the pray'r he makes  When Isaac like the solitary saint  Walks forth to meditate at eventide  And think on her who thinks not for herself  Forgive him then thou bustler in concerns  Of little worth and idler in the best  If author of no mischief and some good  He seek his proper happiness by means  That may advance but cannot hinder thine  Nor though he tread the secret path of life  Engage no notice and enjoy much ease  Account him an incumbrance on the state  Receiving benefits and rend'ring none  His sphere though humble if that humble sphere  Shine with his fair example and though small  His influence if that influence all be spent  In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife  In aiding helpless indigence in works  From which at least a grateful few derive  Some taste of comfort in a world of woe  Then let the supercilious great confess  He serves his country recompenses well  The state beneath the shadow of whose vine  He sits secure and in the scale of life  Holds no ignoble though a slighted place  The man whose virtues are more felt than seen  Must drop indeed the hope of public praise  But he may boast what few that win it can  That if his country stand not by his skill  At least his follies have not wrought her fall  Polite refinement offers him in vain  Her golden tube through which a sensual world  Draws gross impurity and likes it well  The neat conveyance hiding all th' offence  Not that he peevishly rejects a mode  Because that world adopts it If it bear  The stamp and clear impression of good sense  And be not costly more than of true worth  He puts it on and for decorum sake  Can wear it e'en as gracefully as she  She judges of refinement by the eye  He by the test of conscience and a heart  Not soon deceived aware that what is base  No polish can make sterling and that vice  Though well perfumed and elegantly dress'd  Like an unburied carcase trick'd with flow'rs  Is but a garnish'd nuisance fitter far  For cleanly riddance than for fair attire  So life glides smoothly and by stealth away  More golden than that age of fabled gold  Renown'd in ancient song not vex'd with care  Or stained with guilt beneficent approved  Of God and man and peaceful in its end  So glide my life away and so at last  My share of duties decently fulfilled  May some disease not tardy to perform  Its destin'd office yet with gentle stroke  Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat  Beneath the turf that I have often trod  It shall not grieve me then that once when called  To dress a Sofa with the flow'rs of verse  I play'd awhile obedient to the fair  With that light task but soon to please her more  Whom flow'rs alone I knew would little please  Let fall th' unfinish'd wreath and roved for fruit  Roved far and gather'd much Some harsh 'tis true  Pick'd from the thorns and briars of reproof  But wholesome welldigested Grateful some  To palates that can taste immortal truth  Insipid else and sure to be despised  But all is in his hand whose praise I seek  In vain the poet sings and the world hears  If he regard not though divine the theme  'Tis not in artful measures in the chime  And idle tinkling of a minstrel's lyre  To charm his ear whose eye is on the heart  Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain  Whose approbationprosper

cheat  A tedious hourand now we never meet  As some grave gentleman in Terence says  'Twas therefore much the same in ancient days  Good lack we know not what tomorrow brings  Strange fluctuation of all human things  True Changes will befall and friends may part  But distance only cannot change the heart  And were I call'd to prove th' assertion true  One proof should serve a reference to you  Whence comes it then that in the wane of life  Though nothing have occurr'd to kindle strife  We find the friends we fancied we had won  Though num'rous once reduced to few or none  Can gold grow

man and knew his nature mild  And was his plaything often when a child  But somewhat at that moment pinch'd him close  Else he was seldom bitter or morose  Perhaps his confidence just then betray'd  His grief might prompt him with the speech he made  Perhaps 'twas mere goodhumour gave it birth  The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth  Howe'er it was his language in my mind  Bespoke at least a man that knew mankind  But not to moralize too much and strain  To prove an evil of which all complain  I hate long arguments verbosely spun  One story more dear Hill and I have done  Once on a time

show his bosom bare  The punishment importing this no doubt  That all was naught within and all found out  Oh happy Britain we have not to fear  Such hard and arbitrary measure here  Else could a law like that which I relate  Once have the sanction of our triple state  Some few that I have known in days of old  Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold  While you my friend whatever wind should

WILLIAM CAWTHORNE UNWIN RECTOR OF STOCK IN ESSEX THE TUTOUR OF HIS TWO SONS THE FOLLOWING POEM RECOMMENDING PRIVATE TUITION IN PREFERENCE TO AN EDUCATION AT SCHOOL IS INSCRIBED BY HIS AFFECTIONATE FRIEND  WILLIAM COWPER  Olney    Nov  TIROCINIUM  IT is not from his form in which we trace  Strength joined with beauty dignity with grace  That man the master of this globe derives  His right of empire over all that lives  That form indeed th' associate of a mind  Vast in its pow'rs ethereal in its kind  That form the labour of almighty skill  Framed for the service of a freeborn will  Asserts precedence and bespeaks controul  But borrows all its grandeur from the soul  Hers is the state the splendour and the throne  An intellectual kingdom all her own  For her the mem'ry fills her ample page  With truths pour'd down from ev'ry distant age  For her amasses an unbounded store  The wisdom of great nations now no more  Though laden not incumber'd with her spoil  Laborious yet unconscious of her toil  When copiously supplied then most enlarged  Still to be fed and not to be surcharged  For her the fancy roving unconfined  The present muse of ev'ry pensive mind  Works magic wonders adds a brighter hue  To nature's scenes than nature ever knew  At her command winds rise and waters roar  Again she lays them slumb'ring on the shore  With flow'r and fruit the wilderness supplies  Or bids the rocks in ruder pomp arise  For her the judgment umpire in the strife  That grace and nature have to wage through life  Quicksighted arbiter of good and ill  Appointed sage preceptor to the will  Condemns approves and with a faithful voice  Guides the decision of a doubtful choice  Why did the fiat of a God give birth  To yon fair sun and his attendant earth  And when descending he resigns the skies  Why takes the gent'ler moon her turn to rise  Whom ocean feels through all his countless waves  And owns her pow'r on ev'ry shore he laves  Why do the seasons still enrich the year  Fruitful and young as in their first career  Spring hangs her infant blossoms on the trees  Rock'd in the cradle of the western breeze  Summer in haste the thriving charge receives  Beneath the shade of her expanded leaves  'Till autumn's fiercer heats and plenteous dews  Dye them at last in all their glowing hues  'Twere wild profusion all and bootless waste  Pow'r misemployed munificence misplaced  Had not its author dignified the plan  And crowned it with the majesty of man  Thus form'd thus placed intelligent and taught  Look where he will the wonders God has wrought  The wildest scorner of his Maker's laws  Finds in a sober moment time to pause  To press th' important question on his heart  "Why form'd at all and wherefore as thou art"  If man be what he seems this hour a slave  The next mere dust and ashes in the grave  Endued with reason only to descry  His crimes and follies with an aching eye  With passions just that he may prove with pain  The force he spends against their fury vain  And if soon after having burnt by turns  With ev'ry lust with which frail nature burns  His being end where death dissolves the bond  The tomb take all and all be blank beyond  Then he of all that nature has brought forth  Stands selfimpeach'd the creature of least worth  And useless while he lives and when he dies  Brlngs into doubt the wisdom of the skies  Truths that the learn'd pursue with eager thought  Are not important always as dearbought  Proving at last though told in pompous strains  A childish waste of philosophic pains  But truths on which depends our main concern  That 'tis our shame and mis'ry not to learn  Shine by the side of ev'ry path we tread  With such a lustre he that runs may read  'Tis true that if to trifle life away  Down to the sunset of their latest day  Then perish on futurity's wide shore  Like fleeting exhalations found no more  Were all that heav'n required of human kind  And all the plan their destiny designed  What none could rev'rence all might justly blame  And man would breathe but for his Maker's shame  But reason heard and nature well perused  At once the dreaming mind is disabused  If all we find possessing earth sea air  Reflect his attributes who plac'd them there  Fulfill the purpose and appear design'd  Proofs of the wisdom of th' allseeing mind  'Tis plain the creature whom he chose t' invest  With kingship and dominion o'er the rest  Received his nobler nature and was made  Fit for the power in which he stands array'd  That first or last hereafter if not here  He too might make his author's wisdom clear  Praise him on earth or obstinately dumb  Suffer his justice in a world to come  This once believed 'twere logic misapplied  To prove a consequence by none denied  That we are bound to cast the minds of youth  Betimes into the mould of heav'nly truth  That taught of God they may indeed be wise  Nor ignorantly wand'ring miss the skies  In early days the conscience has in most  A quickness which in later life is lost  Preserved from guilt by salutary fears  Or guilty soon relenting into tears  Too careless often as our years proceed  What friends we sort with or what books we read  Our parents yet exert a prudent care  To feed our infant minds with proper fare  And wisely store the nurs'ry by degrees  With wholesome learning yet acquired with ease  Neatly secured from being soiled or torn  Beneath a pane of thin translucent horn  A book to please us at a tender age  'Tis call'd a book though but a single page  Presents the pray'r the Saviour deign'd to teach  Which children use and parsonswhen they preach  Lisping our syllables we scramble next  Through moral narrative or sacred text  And learn with wonder how this world began  Who made who marr'd and who has ransom'd man  Points which unless the Scripture made them plain  The wisest heads might agitate in vain  Oh thou whom borne on fancy's eager wing  Back to the season of life's happy spring  I

sense and simple stile  May teach the gayest make the gravest smile  Witty and wellemploy'd and like thy Lord  Speaking in parables his slighted word  I name thee not lest so despised a name  Should move a sneer at thy deserved fame  Yet ev'n in transitory life's late day  That mingles all my brown with sober gray  Revere the man whose  Pilgrim  marks the road  And guides the  Progress  of the soul to God  'Twere well with most if books that could engage  Their childhood pleased them at a riper age  The man approving what had charm'd the boy  Would die at last in comfort peace and joy  And

 Regards with scorn though once received with awe  And warp'd into the labyrinth of lies  That babblers called philosophers devise  Blasphemes his creed as founded on a plan  Replete with dreams

modest truth for wits eccentric range  'Time was he closed as he began the day  With decent duty not ashamed to pray  The practice was a bond upon his heart  A pledge he gave for a consistent part

notices of truth disgraced  Soon lose their credit and are all effaced  Would you your son should be a sot or dunce  Lascivious headstrong or all these at once  That in good time the stripling's finish'd taste  For loose expence and fashionable waste  Should prove your ruin and his own at last  Train him in public with a mob of boys  Childish in mischief only and in noise  Else of a mannish growth and five in ten  In infidelity and lewdness men  There shall he learn 'ere sixteen winter's old  That authors are most useful pawn'd or sold  That pedantry is all that schools impart  But taverns teach the knowledge of the heart  There waiter Dick with Bacchanalian lays  Shall win his heart and have his drunken praise  His counsellor and bosomfriend shall prove  And some streetpacing harlot his first love  Schools unless discipline where doubly strong  Detain their adolescent charge too long  The management of Tiro's of eighteen  Is difficult their punishment obscene  The stout tall Captain whose superior size  The minor heroes view with envious eyes  Becomes their pattern upon whom they fix  Their whole attention and ape all his tricks  His pride that scorns t' obey or to submit  With them is courage his effront'ry wit  His wild excursions windowbreaking feats  Robb'ry of gardens quarrels in the streets  His hairbreadth 'scapes and all his daring schemes  Transport them and are made their fav'rite themes  In little bosoms such atchievements strike  A kindred spark they burn to do the like  Thus half accomplish'd 'ere he yet begin  To show the peeping down upon his chin  And as maturity of years comes on  Made just th' adept that you design'd your son  T' insure the perseverance of his course  And give your monstrous project all its force  Send him to college If he there be tamed  Or in one article of vice reclaimed  Where no regard of ord'nances is shown  Or look'd for now the fault must be his own  Some sneaking virtue lurks in him no doubt  Where neither strumpets charms nor drinkingbout  Nor gambling practices can find it out  Such youths of spirit and that spirit too  Ye nurs'ries of our boys we owe to you  Though from ourselves the mischief more proceeds  For public schools 'tis public folly feeds  The slaves of custom and establish'd mode  With packhorse constancy we keep the road  Crooked or strait through quags or thorny dells  True to the jingling of our leaders bells  To follow foolish precedents and wink  With both our eyes is easier than to think  And such an age as ours baulks no expence  Except of caution and of commonsense  Else sure notorious fact and proof so plain  Would turn our steps into a wiser train  I blame not those who with what care they can  O'erwatch the num'rous and unruly clan  Or if I blame 'tis only that they dare  Promise a work of which they must despair  Have ye ye sage intendants of the whole  An ubiquarian presence and controul  Elisha's eye that when Gehazi stray'd  Went with him and saw all the game he play'd  Yesye are conscious and on all the shelves  Your pupils strike upon have struck yourselves  Or if by nature sober ye had then  Boys as ye were the gravity of men  Ye knew at least by constant proofs address'd  To ears and eyes the vices of the rest  But ye connive at what ye cannot cure  And evils not to be endured endure  Lest pow'r exerted but without success  Should make the little ye retain still less  Ye once were justly famed for bringing forth  Undoubted scholarship and genuine worth  And in the firmament of fame still shines  A glory bright as that of all the signs  Of poets raised by you and statesmen and divines  Peace to them all those brilliant times are fled  And no such lights are kindling in their stead  Our striplings shine indeed but with such rays  As set the midnight riot in a blaze  And seem if judged by their expressive looks  Deeper in none than in their surgeons books  Say muse for education made the song  No muse can hesitate or linger long  What causes move us knowing as we must  That these  Menageries  all fail their trust  To send our sons to scout and scamper there  While colts and puppies cost us so much care  Be it a weakness it deserves some praise  We love the playplace of our early days  The scene is touching and the heart is stone  That feels not at that sight and feels at none  The wall on which we tried our graving skill  The very name we carved subsisting still  The bench on which we sat while deepemploy'd  Though mangled hack'd and hew'd not yet destroy'd  The little ones unbutton'd glowing hot  Playing our games and on the very spot  As happy as we once to kneel and draw  The chalky ring and knuckle down at taw  To pitch the ball into the grounded hat  Or drive it devious with a dex'trous pat  The pleasing spectacle at once excites  Such recollection of our own delights  That viewing it we seem almost t' obtain  Our innocent sweet simple years again  This fond attachment to the wellknown place  Whence first we started into life's long race  Maintains its hold with such unfailing sway  We feel it ev'n in age and at our latest day  Hark how the sire of chits whose future share  Of classic food begins to be his care  With his own likeness placed on either knee  Indulges all a father's heartfelt glee  And tells them as he strokes their silver locks  That they must soon learn Latin and to box  Then turning he regales his list'ning wife  With all th' adventures of his early life  His skill in coachmanship or driving chaise  In bilking tavern bills and spouting plays  What shifts he used detected in a scrape  How he was flogg'd or had the luck t' escape  What sums he lost at play and how he sold  Watch seals and all 'till all his pranks are told  Retracing thus his  frolics  'tis a name  That palliates deeds of folly and of shame  He gives the local biass all its sway  Resolves that where he play'd his sons shall play  And destines their bright genius to be shown  Just in the scene where he display'd his own  The meek and bashful boy will soon be taught  To be as bold and forward as he ought  The rude will scuffle through with ease enough  Great schools suit best the sturdy and the rough  Ah happy designation prudent choice  Th' event is sure expect it and rejoice  Soon see your wish fulfilled in either child  The pert made perter and the tame made wild  The great indeed by titles riches birth  Excused th' incumbrance of more solid worth  Are best disposed of where with most success  They may acquire that confident address  Those habits of profuse and lew'd expence  That scorn of all delights but those of sense  Which though in plain plebeians we condemn  With so much reason all expect from them  But families of less illustrious fame  Whose chief distinction is their spotless name  Whose heirs their honours none their income small  Must shine by true desert or not at all  What dream they of that with so little care  They risk their hopes their dearest treasure there  They dream of little Charles or William graced  With wig prolix downflowing to his waist  They see th' attentive crowds his talents draw  They hear him speakthe oracle of law  The father who designs his babe a priest  Dreams him episcopally such at least  And while the playful jockey scow'rs the room  Briskly astride upon the parlour broom  In fancy sees him more superbly ride  In coach with purple lined and mitres on its side  Events improbable and strange as these  Which only a parental eye foresees  A public school shall bring to pass with ease  But how resides such virtue in that air  As must create an appetite for pray'r  And will it breathe into him all the zeal  That candidates for such a prize should feel  To take the lead and be the foremost still  In all true worth and literary skill  "Ah blind to bright futurity untaught  "The knowledge of the world and dull of thought  "Churchladders are not always mounted best  "By learned Clerks and Latinists profess'd  "Th' exalted prize demands an upward look  "Not to be found by poring on a book  "Small skill in Latin and still less in Greek  "Is more than adequate to all I seek  "Let erudition grace him or not grace  "I give the bawble but the second place  "His wealth fame honors all that I intend  "Subsist and center in one pointa friend  "A friend whate'er he studies or neglects  "Shall give him consequence heal all defects  "His intercourse with peers and sons of peers  "There dawns the splendour of his future years  "In that bright quarter his propitious skies  "Shall blush betimes and there his glory rise  "  Your Lordship and your Grace  what school can teach  "A rhet'ric equal to those parts of speech  "What need of Homer's verse or Tully's prose  "Sweet interjections if he learn but those  "Let rev'rend churls his ignorance rebuke  "Who starve upon a dogsear'd Pentateuch  "The parson knows enough who knows a Duke"  Egregious purpose worthily begun  In barb'rous prostitution of your son  Pressed on  his  part by means that would disgrace  A scriv'ners clerk or footman out of place  And ending if at last its end be gained  In sacrilege in God's own house profaned  It may succeed and if his sins should call  For more than common punishment it shall  The wretch shall rise and be the thing on earth  Least qualified in honor learning worth  To occupy a sacred awful post  In which the best and worthiest tremble most  The  royal letters  are a thing of course  A king that would might recommend his horse  And Deans no doubt and Chapters with one voice  As bound in duty would confirm the choice  Behold your Bishop well he plays his part  Christian in name and Infidel in heart  Ghostly in office earthly in his plan  A slave at court elsewhere a lady's man  Dumb as a senator and as a priest  A piece of mere churchfurniture at best  To live estranged from God his total scope  And his end sure without one glimpse of hope  But fair although and feasible it seem  Depend not much upon your golden dream  For Providence that seems concern'd t' exempt  The hallow'd bench from absolute contempt  In spite of all the wrigglers into place  Still keeps a seat or two for worth and grace  And therefore 'tis that though the sight be rare  We sometimes see a Lowth or Bagot there  Besides schoolfriendships are not always found  Though fair in promise permanent and sound  The most disint'rested and virtuous minds  In early years connected time unbinds  New situations give a diff'rent cast  Of habit inclination temper taste  And he that seem'd our counterpart at first  Soon shows the strong similitude revers'd  Young heads are giddy and young hearts are warm  And make mistakes for manhood to reform  Boys are at best but pretty buds unblown  Whose scent and hues are rather guess'd than known  Each dreams that each is just what he appears  But learns his error in maturer years  When disposition like a sail unfurl'd  Shows all its rents and patches to the world  If therefore ev'n when honest in design  A boyish friendship may so soon decline  'Twere wiser sure t' inspire a little heart  With just abhorrence of so mean a part  Than set your son to work at a vile trade  For wages so unlikely to be paid  Our public hives of puerile resort  That are of chief and most approved report  To such base hopes in many a sordid soul  Owe their repute in part but not the whole  A principle whose proud pretensions pass  Unquestioned though the jewel be but glass  That with a world not often overnice  Ranks as a virtue and is yet a vice  Or rather a gross compound justly tried  Of envy hatred jealousy and pride  Contributes most perhaps t' inhance their fame  And Emulation is its specious name  Boys once on fire with that contentious zeal  Feel all the rage that female rivals feel  The prize of beauty in a woman's eyes  Not brighter than in theirs the scholar's prize  The spirit of that competition burns  With all varieties of ill by turns  Each vainly magnifies his own success  Resents his fellows wishes it were less  Exults in his miscarriage if he fail  Deems his reward too great if he prevail  And labors to surpass him day and night  Less for improvement than to tickle spite  The spur is pow'rful and I grant its force  It pricks the genius forward in its course  Allows short time for play and none sor sloth  And felt alike by each advances both  But judge where so much evil intervenes  The end though plausible not worth the means  Weigh for a moment classical desert  Against an heart depraved and temper hurt  Hurt too perhaps for life for early wrong  Done to the nobler part affects it long  And you are staunch indeed in learning's cause  If you can crown a discipline that draws  Such mischiefs after it with much applause  Connection form'd for int'rest and endear'd  By selfish views thus censured and cashier'd  And emulation as engend'ring hate  Doom'd to a no less ignominious fate  The props of such proud seminaries fall  The JACHIN and the BOAZ of them all  Great schools rejected then as those that swell  Beyond a size that can be managed well  Shall royal institutions miss the bays  And small academies win all the praise  Force not my drift beyond its just intent  I praise a school as Pope a government  So take my judgment in his language dress'd  "Whate'er is best administer'd is best"  Few boys are born with talents that excel  But all are capable of living well  Then ask not whether limited or large  But watch they strictly or neglect their charge  If anxious only that their boys may  learn    While  Morals  languish a despised concern  The great and small deserve one common blame  Diff'rent in size but in effect the same  Much zeal in virtue's cause all teachers boast  Though motives of mere lucre sway the most  Therefore in towns and cities they abound  For there the game they seek is easiest found  Though there in spite of all that care can do  Traps to catch youth are most abundant too  If shrew'd and of a wellconstructed brain  Keen in pursuit and vig'rous to retain  Your son come forth a prodigy of skill  As wheresoever taught so form'd he will  The paedagogue with selfcomplacent air  Claims more than half the praise as his due share  But if with all his genius he betray  Not more intelligent than loose and gay  Such vicious habits as disgrace his name  Threaten his health his fortune and his fame  Though want of due restraint alone have bred  The symptoms that you see with so much dread  Unenvied there he may sustain alone  The whole reproach the fault was all his own  Oh 'tis a sight to be with joy perused  By all whom sentiment has not abused  Newfangled sentiment the boasted grace  Of those who never feel in the right place  A sight surpassed by none that we can show  Though Vestris on one leg still shine below  A father blest with an ingenuous son  Father and friend and tutour all in one  How turn again to tales long since forgot  Aesop and Phaedrus and the restwhy not  He will not blush that has a father's heart  To take in childish plays a childish part  But bends his sturdy back to any toy  That youth takes pleasure in to please his boy  Then why resign into a stranger's hand  A task as much within your own command  That God and nature and your int'rest too  Seem with one voice to delegate to you  Why hire a lodging in a house unknown  For one whose tend'rest thoughts all hover round your own  This second weaning needless as it is  How does it lacerate both your heart and his  Th' indented stick that loses day by day  Notch after notch 'till all are smooth'd away  Bears witness long 'ere his dismission come  With what intense desire he wants his home  But though the joys he hopes beneath your roof  Bid fair enough to answer in the proof  Harmless and safe and nat'ral as they are  A disappointment waits him even there  Arrived he feels an unexpected change  He blushes hangs his head is shy and strange  No longer takes as once with fearless ease  His fav'rite stand between his father's knees  But seeks the corner of some distant seat  And eyes the door and watches a retreat  And least familiar where he should be most  Feels all his happiest privileges lost  Alas poor boythe natural effect  Of love by absence chilled into respect  Say what accomplishments at school acquired  Brings he to sweeten fruits so undesired  Thou well deserv'st an alienated son  Unless thy conscious heart acknowledgenone  None that in thy domestic snug recess  He had not made his own with more address  Though some perhaps that shock thy feeling mind  And better never learn'd or left behind  Add too that thus estranged thou can'st obtain  By no kind arts his confidence again  That here begins with most that long complaint  Of filial frankness lost and love grown faint  Which oft neglected in life's waning years  A parent pours into regardless ears  Like caterpillars dangling under trees  By slender threads and swinging in the breeze  Which filthily bewray and sore disgrace  The boughs in which are bred th' unseemly race  While ev'ry worm industriously weaves  And winds his web about the rivell'd leaves  So num'rous are the follies that annoy  'The mind and heart of ev'ry sprightly boy  Imaginations noxious and perverse  Which admonition can alone disperse  Th' encroaching nuisance asks a faithful hand  Patient affectionate of high command  To check the procreation of a breed  Sure to exhaust the plant on which they feed  'Tis not enough that Greek or Roman page  At stated hours his freakish thoughts engage  Ev'n in his pastimes he requires a friend  To warn and teach him safely to unbend  O'er all his pleasures gently to preside  Watch his emotions and controul their tide  And levying thus and with an easy sway  A tax of profit from his very play  T' impress a value not to be eras'd  On moments squander'd else and running all to waste  And seems it nothing in a father's eye  That unimproved those many moments fly  And is he well content his son should find  No nourishment to feed his growing mind  But conjugated verbs and nouns declined  For such is all the mental food purvey'd  By public hacknies in the schooling trade  Who feed a pupils intellect with store  Of syntax truely but with little more  Dismiss their cares when they dismiss their flock  Machines themselves and govern'd by a clock  Perhaps a father blest with any brains  Would deem it no abuse or waste of pains  T' improve this diet at no great expence  With sav'ry truth and wholesome common sense  To lead his son for prospects of delight  To some not steep though philosophic height  Thence to exhibit to his wondering eyes  Yon circling worlds their distance and their size  The moons of Jove and Saturn's belted ball  And the harmonious order of them all  To show him in an insect or a flow'r  Such microscopic proofs of skill and pow'r  As hid from ages pass'd God now displays  To combat Atheists with in modern days  To spread the earth before him and commend  With designation of the fingers end  Its various parts to his attentive note  Thus bringing home to him the most remote  To teach his heart to glow with gen'rous flame  Caught from the deeds of men of ancient fame  And more than all with commendation due  To set some living worthy in his view  Whose fair example may at once inspire  A wish to copy what he must admire  Such knowledge gained betimes and which appears  Though solid not too weighty for his years  Sweet in itself and not forbidding sport  When health demands it of athletic sort  Would make him what some lovely boys have been  And more than one perhaps that I have seen  An evidence and reprehension both  Of the mere schoolboy's lean and tardy growth  Art thou a man professionally tied  With all thy faculties elsewhere applied  Too busy to intend a meaner care  Than how to enrich thyself and next thine heir  Or art thou as though rich perhaps thou art  But poor in knowledge having none to impart  Behold that figure neat though plainly clad  His sprightly mingled with a shade of sad  Not of a nimble tongue though now and then  Heard to articulate like other men  No jester and yet lively in discourse  His phrase well chosen clear and full of force  And his address if not quite French in ease  Not English stiff but frank and formed to please  Low in the world because he scorns its arts  A man of letters manners morals parts  Unpatronized and therefore little known  Wise for himself and his few friends alone  In him thy well appointed proxy see  Armed for a work too difficult for thee  Prepared by taste by learning and true worth  To form thy son to strike his genius forth  Beneath thy roof beneath thine eye to prove  The force of discipline when back'd by love  To double all thy pleasure in thy child  His mind informed his morals undefiled  Safe under such a wing the boy shall show  No spots contracted among grooms below  Nor taint his speech with meannesses design'd  By footman Tom for witty and refin'd  Therein his commerce with the liveried herd  Lurks the contagion chiefly to be fear'd  For since so fashion dictates all who claim  An higher than a mere plebeian fame  Find it expedient come what mischief may  To entertain a thief or two in pay  And they that can afford th' expence of more  Some half a dozen and some half a score  Great cause occurs to save him from a band  So sure to spoil him and so near at hand  A point secured if once he be supplied  With some such Mentor always at his side  Are such men rare perhaps they would abound  Were occupation easier to be found  Were education else so sure to fail  Conducted on a manageable scale  And schools that have outlived all just esteem  Exchang'd for the secure domestie scheme  But having found him be thou duke or earl  Show thou hast sense enough to prize the pearl  And as thou would'st th' advancement of thine heir  In all good faculties beneath his care  Respect as is but rational and just  A man deem'd worthy of so dear a trust  Despised by thee what more can he expect  From youthful folly than the same neglect  A flat and fatal negative obtains  That instant upon all his future pains  His lessons tire his mild rebukes offend  And all the instructions of thy son's best friend  Are a stream choak'd or trickling to no end  Doom him not then to solitary meals  But recollect that he has sense and feels  And that possessor of a soul refin'd  An upright heart and cultivated mind  His post not mean his talents not unknown  He deems it hard to vegetate alone  And if admitted at thy board he sit  Account him no just mark for idle wit  Offend not him whom modesty restrains  From repartee with jokes that he disdains  Much less transfix his feelings with an oath  Nor frown unless he vanish with the cloth  And trust me his utility may reach  To more than he is hired or bound to teach  Much trash unutter'd and some ills undone  Through rev'rence of the censor of thy son  But if thy table be indeed unclean  Foul with excess and with discourse obscene  And thou a wretch whom following her old plan  The world accounts an honourable man  Because forsooth thy courage has been tried  And stood the test perhaps on the wrong side  Though thou hadst never grace enough to prove  That any thing but vice could win thy love  Or hast thou a polite cardplaying wife  Chained to the routs that she frequents for life  Who just when industry begins to snore  Flies wing'd with joy to some coachcrouded door  And thrice in ev'ry winter throngs thine own  With half the chariots and sedans in town  Thyself meanwhile e'en shifting as thou may'st  Not very sober though nor very chaste  Or is thine house though less superb thy rank  If not a scene of pleasure a mere blank  And thou at best and in thy sob'rest mood  A trifler vain and empty of all good  Though mercy for thyself thou can'st have none  Hear nature plead show mercy to thy son  Saved from his home where ev'ry day brings forth  Some mischief fatal to his future worth  Find him a better in a distant spot  Within some pious pastor's humble cot  Where vile example your's I chiefly mean  The most seducing and the oft'nest seen  May never more be stamp'd upon his breast  Not yet perhaps incurably impress'd  Where early rest makes early rising sure  Disease or comes not or finds easy cure  Prevented much by diet neat and plain  Or if it enter soon starved out again  Where all th' attention of his faithful host  Discreetly limited to two at most  May raise such fruits as shall reward his care  And not at last evaporate in air  Where stillness aiding study and his mind  Serene and to his duties much inclined  Not occupied in daydreams as at home  Of pleasures past or follies yet to come  His virtuous toil may terminate at last  In settled habit and decided taste  But whom do I advise the fashionled  Th' incorrigibly wrong the deaf the dead  Whom care and cool deliberation suit  Not better much than spectacles a brute  Who if their sons some slight tuition share  Deem it of no great moment whose or where  Too proud t' adopt the thoughts of one unknown  And much too gay t' have any of their own  But courage man methought the muse replied  Mankind are various and the world is wide  The ostrich silliest of the feather'd kind  And form'd of God without a parent's mind  Commits her eggs incautious to the dust  Forgetful that the foot may crush the trust  And while on public nurs'ries they rely  Not knowing and too oft not caring why  Irrational in what they thus prefer  No few that would seem wise resemble her  But all are not alike Thy warning voice  May here and there prevent erroneous choice  And some perhaps who busy as they are  Yet make their progeny their dearest care  Whose hearts will ache once told what ills may reach  Their offspring left upon so wild a beach  Will need no stress of argument t' inforce  Th' expedience of a less advent'rous course  The rest will slight thy counsel or condemn  But  they  have human feelings Turn to  them  To you then tenants of life's middle state  Securely placed between the small and great  Whose character yet undebauch'd retains  Two thirds of all the virtue that remains  Who wise yourselves desire your sons should learn  Your wisdom and your waysto you I turn  Look round you on a world perversely blind  See what contempt is fall'n on human kind  See wealth abused and dignities misplac'd  Great titles offices and trusts disgrac'd  Long lines of ancestry renown'd of old  Their noble qualities all quench'd and cold  See Bedlam's closetted and handcuff'd charge  Surpass'd in frenzy by the mad at large  See great commanders making war a trade  Great lawyers lawyers without study made  Churchmen in whose esteem their blest employ  Is odious and their wages all their joy  Who far enough from furnishing their shelves  With gospel lore turn infidels themselves  See womanhood despised and manhood shamed  With infamy too nauseous to be named  Fops at all corners ladylike in mien  Civetted fellows smelt 'ere they are seen  Else coarse and rude in manners and their tongue  On fire with curses and with nonsense hung  Now flush'd with drunk'ness now with whoredom pale  Their breath a sample of last night's regale  See volunteers in all the vilest arts  Men well endowed of honourable parts  Design'd by nature wise but selfmade fools  All these and more like these were bred at schools  And if it chance as sometimes chance it will  That though schoolbred the boy be virtuous still  Such rare exceptions shining in the dark  Prove rather than impeach the just remark  As here and there a twinkling star descried  Serves but to show how black is all beside  Now look on him whose very voice in tone  Just echos thine whose features are thine own  And stroke his polish'd cheek of purest red  And lay thine hand upon his flaxen head  And say my boy th' unwelcome hour is come  When thou transplanted from thy genial home  Must find a colder soil and bleaker air  And trust for safety to a stranger's care  What character what turn thou wilt assume  From constant converse with I know not whom  Who there will court thy friendship with what views  And artless as thou art whom thou wilt chuse  Though much depends on what thy choice shall be  Is all chancemedley and unknown to me  Can'st thou the tear just trembling on thy lids  And while the dreadful risque foreseen forbids  Free too and under no constraining force  Unless the sway of custom warp thy course  Lay such a stake upon the losing side  Merely to gratify so blind a guide  Thou can'st not Nature pulling at thine heart  Condemns th' unfatherly th' imprudent part  Thou would'st not deaf to Nature's tend'rest plea  Turn him adrift upon a rolling sea  Nor say  go thither  conscious that there lay  A brood of asps or quicksands in his way  Then only govern'd by the selfsame rule  Of nat'ral pity send him not to school  NoGuard him better Is he not thine own  Thyself in miniature thy flesh thy bone  And hopest thou not 'tis ev'ry father's hope  That since thy strength must with thy years elope  And thou wilt need some comfort to assuage  Health's last farewell a staff of thine old age  That then in recompense of all thy cares  Thy child shall show respect to thy grey hairs  Befriend thee of all other friends bereft  And give thy life its only cordial left  Aware then how much danger intervenes  To compass that good end forecast the means  His heart now passive yields to thy command  Secure it thine Its key is in thine hand  If thou desert thy charge and throw it wide  Nor heed what guests there enter and abide  Complain not if attachments lewd and base  Supplant thee in it and usurp thy place  But if thou guard its sacred chambers sure  From vicious inmates and delights impure  Either his gratitude shall hold him fast  And keep him warm and filial to the last  Or if he prove unkind as who can say  But being man and therefore frail he may  One comfort yet shall cheer thine aged heart  Howe'er he slight thee thou hast done thy part  Oh barb'rous would'st thou with a Gothic hand  Pull down the schoolswhatall the schools i' th' land  Or throw them up to liv'rynags and grooms  Or turn them into shops and auctionrooms  A captious question sir and your's is one  Deserves an answer similar or none  Would'st thou possessor of a flock employ  Apprized that he is such a careless boy  And feed him well and give him handsome pay  Merely to sleep and let them run astray  Survey our schools and colleges and see  A sight not much unlike my simile  From education as the leading cause  The public character its colour draws  Thence the prevailing manners take their cast  Extravagant or sober loose or chaste  And though I would not advertize them yet  Nor write on each  This Building to be Lett    Unless the world were all prepared to embrace  A plan wellworthy to supply their place  Yet backward as they are and long have been  To cultivate and keep the MORALS clean  Forgive the crime I wish them I confess  Or better managed or encouraged less  THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN SHEWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN  JOHN Gilpin was a citizen  Of credit and renown  A trainband Captain eke was he  Of famous London town  John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear  Though wedded we have been  These twice ten tedious years yet we  No holiday have seen  Tomorrow is our weddingday  And we will then repair  Unto the Bell at Edmonton  All in a chaise and pair  My sister and my sister's child  My self and children three  Will fill the chaise so you must ride  On horseback after we  He soon replied I do admire  Of womankind but one  And you are she my dearest dear  Therefore it shall be done  I am a linnendraper bold  As all the world doth know  And my good friend the Callender  Will lend his horse to go  Quoth Mrs Gilpin that's well said  And for that wine is dear  We will be furnish'd with our own  Which is both bright and clear  John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife  O'erjoy'd was he to find  That though on pleasure she was bent  She had a frugal mind  The morning came the chaise was brought  But yet was not allow'd  To drive up to the door lest all  Should say that she was proud  So three doors off the chaise was stay'd  Where they did all get in  Six precious souls and all agog  To dash through thick and thin  Smack went the whip round went the  Were never folk so glad  The stones did rattle underneath  As if Cheapside were mad  John Gilpin at his horse's side  Seized fast the flowing main  And up he got in haste to ride  But soon came down again  For saddletree scarce reach'd had he  His journey to begin  When turning round his head he saw  Three customers come in  So down he came for loss of time  Although it grieved him sore  Yet loss of pence full well he knew  Would trouble him much more  'Twas long before the customers  Were suited to their mind  When Betty screaming came down stairs  "The wine is left behind"  Good lack quoth he yet bring it me  My leathern belt likewise  In which I bear my trusty sword  When I do exercise  Now Mistress Gilpin careful soul  Had two stone bottles found  To hold the liquor that she loved  And keep it safe and sound  Each bottle had a curling ear  Through which the belt he drew  And hung a bottle on each side  To make his balance true  Then over all that he might be  Equipp'd from top to toe  His long red cloak well brush'd and neat  He manfully did throw  Now see him mounted once again  Upon his nimble steed  Full slowly pacing o'er the stones  With caution and good heed  But finding soon a smoother road  Beneath his wellshod feet  The snorting beast began to trot  Which gall'd him in his seat  So fair and softly John he cried  But John he cried in vain  That trot became a gallop soon  In spite of curb and rein  So stooping down as needs he must  Who cannot sit upright  He grasp'd the mane with both his hands  And eke with all his might  His horse who never in that sort  Had handled been before  What thing upon his back had got  Did wonder more and more  Away went Gilpin neck or nought  Away went hat and wig  He little dreamt when he set out  Of running such a rig  The wind did blow the cloak did fly  Like streamer long and gay  'Till loop and button failing both  At last it flew away  Then might all people well discern  The bottles he had slung  A bottle swinging at each side  As hath been said or sung  The dogs did bark the children scream'd  Up flew the windows all  And ev'ry soul cried out well done  As loud as he could bawl  Away went Gilpinwho but he  His fame soon spread around  He carries weight he rides a race  'Tis for a thousand pound  And still as fast as he drew near  'Twas wonderful to view  How in a trice the turnpikemen  Their gates wide open threw  And now as he went bowing down  His reeking head full low  The bottles twain behind his back  Were shatter'd at a blow  Down ran the wine into the road  Most piteous to be seen  Which made his horse's flanks to smoke  As they had basted been  But still he seem'd to carry weight  With leathern girdle braced  For all might see the bottle necks  Still dangling at his waist  Thus all through merry Islington  These gambols he did play  And till he came unto the wash  Of Edmonton so gay  And there he threw the wash about  On both sides of the way  Just like unto a trundling mop  Or a wildgoose at play  At Edmonton his loving wife  From the balcony spied  Her tender husband wond'ring much  To see how he did ride  Stop stop John GilpinHere's the house  They all at once did cry  The dinner waits and we are tir'd  Said Gilpinso am I  But yet his horse was not a whit  Inclined to tarry there  For why his owner had a house  Full ten miles off at Ware  So like an arrow swift he flew  Shot by an archer strong  So did he flywhich brings me to  The middle of my song  Away went Gilpin out of breath  And sore against his will  Till at his friend's the Callender's  His horse at last stood still  The Callender amazed to see  His neighbour in such trim  Laid down his pipe flew to the gate  And thus accosted him  What news what news your tidings tell  Tell me you must and shall  Say why bare headed you are come  Or why you come at all  Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit  And loved a timely joke  And thus unto the Callender  In merry guise he spoke  I came because your horse would come  And if I well forebode  My hat and wig will soon be here  They are upon the road  The Callender right glad to find  His friend in merry pin  Return'd him not a single word  But to the house went in  Whence strait he came with hat and wig  A wig that flow'd behind  A hat not much the worse for wear  Each comely in its kind  He held them up and in his turn  Thus show'd his ready wit  My head is twice as big as yours  They therefore needs must fit  But let me scrape the dirt away  That hangs upon your face  And stop and eat for well you may  Be in a hungry case  Said John it is my weddingday  And all the world would stare  If wife should dine at Edmonton  And I should dine at Ware  So turning to his horse he said  I am in haste to dine  'Twas for your pleasure you came here▪  You shall go back for mine  Ah luckless speech and bootless boast  For which he paid full dear  For while he spake a braying ass  Did sing most loud and clear  Whereat his horse did snort as he  Had heard a lion roar  And gallop'd off with all his might  As he had done before  Away went Gilpin and away  Went Gilpin's hat and wig  He lost them sooner than at first  For why they were too big  Now Mistress Gilpin when she saw  Her husband posting down  Into the country far away  She pull'd out half a crown  And thus unto the youth she said  That drove them to the Bell  This shall be yours when you bring back  My husband safe and well  The youth did ride and soon did meet  John coming back amain  Whom in a trice he tried to stop  By catching at his rein  But not performing what he meant  And gladly would have done  The frighted steed he frighted more  And made him faster run  Away went Gilpin and away  Went postboy at his heels  The postboy's horse right glad to miss  The lumb'ring of the wheels  Six gentlemen upon the road  Thus seeing Gilpin fly  With postboy scamp'ring in the rear  They rais'd the hue and cry  Stop thief stop thiefa highwayman  Not one of them was mute  And all and each that pass'd that way  Did join in the pursuit  And now the turnpike gates again  Flew open in short space  The tollmen thinking as before  That Gilpin rode a race  And so he did and won it too  For he got first to town  Nor stopp'd 'till where he had got up  He did again get down  Now let us sing long live the king  And Gilpin long live he  And when he next doth ride abroad  May I be there to see
