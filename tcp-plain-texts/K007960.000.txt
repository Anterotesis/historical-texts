 THE RIVAL SISTERS  A TRAGEDY  Scelerate revertere Theseu  Flecte ratem numerum non habet illa suum  OVID  ADAPTED FOR THEATRICAL REPRESENTATION AS PERFORMED AT THE  THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  REGULATED FROM THE PROMPTBOOK  By Permission of the Manager  The Lines distinguished by inverted Commas are omitted in the Representation and those printed in Italics are Additions  LONDON  PRINTED BY JOHN BELL  British Library  STRAND Bookseller to His ROYAL HIGHNESS the PRINCE of WALES  MDCC XCIII  PREFACE  THERE is perhaps nothing more uninteresting than the generality of those preliminary discourses in which Authors too frequently lay out much of their time in talking of themselves and their works The importance of a Man to himself is fully displayed while the Reader yawns over the tedious page or laughs at the rhetoric that would persuade him he ought to be pleased The present Writer has been unwilling upon almost all occasions to conform to a practice which he saw attended with so little success But the following Tragedy is sent into the worla in a manner that may require some explanation It has not gone through the siery trial of the Theatre nor is it recommended by the favourable decision of an Audience The pomp of splendid scenery and the illusions of the skilful performer have not awakened the public attentionThe Play ventures abroad without having previously gained by the advantages of representation a character which in the leisure of the closet is not always supported But this circumstance while it raises no expectation may on the other hand excite a prejudice not casy to be sarmounted If it be of any value why was it not produced in the usual form of a Public Exhibition The reasons that influenced the Author would lead to a long and frivolous detail Whatever those reasons were whether caprice whim peevishness or delicacy they were of weight to determine his conduct His work however does not go forth with accusations of any kind against the Proprietors of either Theatre it makes no appeal from their judgment The fact is it never was in their hands and where there was no refusal there can be no room for complaint  It need not be dissambled that the Play was written with a view to the Stage It was begun and finished in the Summer at a time when the Author was disabled by a nervous disorder in  his eyes from pursuing a more important work which has engaged several years of his life It was painful to read and he found amusement necessary He walked in green fields made verses and threw them upon paper in characters almost illegible For a subject he was not long at a less He remembered that Madame  de Sévigné  Vide her Letter st April  mentions her having attended the representation of ARIANE a Tragedy by the younger  Corneille  The play says that amiable Writer though in its general style and conduct flat and insipid was notwithstanding followed by all Paris not for the sake of the poetry but the Actress  La Champmélé  whom she calls the greatest prodigy the Stage ever beheld The others were disgusting but when the  Champmélé  entered the scene a murmur of applause ran through the Theatre every heart was interested and every eye dissolved in tears  WHEN this country could with pride boast of an Actress equally followed and perhaps with better reason it occurred that a Tragedy with the beauties of the original but freed from it's defects might at such a season be acceptable to the Public The defects which drew down the judgment of so enlightened a Critic as Madame  de Sévigné  are pointed out with minute exactress by the judicious  Voltaire  See his Edition of Corseille's Works  From that pleasing Writer we learn that the Tragedy in question still keeps it's rank upon the Stage whenever an Actress of eminence wishes for an opportunity to display her talents in a principal character The situation he observes is interesting and pathetic "A princess who has done every thing for her hero who has delivered him from a cruel death and sacrificed all considerations for his sake who loves him generously who thinks herself loved in return and deserves to be so who finds herself at last abandoned by the Man whom she adores and betrayed by a Sister whom she also loved 'A woman thus situated' says I  Voltaire  'forms the happiest subject that has come down to as from antiquity' Notwithstanding this general account  Voltaire's  observations which trace the Author scene by scene show that Madame  de Sévigné  was not mistaken in her judgment  SHALL the present Writer flatter himself that he has removed the vices of the first concoction and substituted what is better He has certainly endeavoured to do it For this purpose a New Fable was necessary The progress of the business required to be conducted in a different manner with more rapidity and without those languid scenes which weaken the interest and too often border upon the dialogue of Comedy The characters were to be cast in a new mould and instead of definitions of the passions their conflict their vehemence and their various transitions were to be painted forth in higher colouring than are to be found in the French composition The Reader therefore is not to expect a mere translation The Author does not scruple to say that he entered into a competition with the original that he has aimed at a better Tragedy and to use the words of a late elegant Writer  he hopes he has shown some invention though he has built upon another man's ground  BUT here again the question recurs if the new superstructure raised upon the old foundation has any merit why not produce it with all the advantage of that celebrated Actress who it seems inspired the first design The plain truth shall be the answer When the piece was finished the Author had his moments of selfapprobation and in his first ardour hinted to a friend that he intended to give it to the Stage But selfapprobation did not last longThat glow of imagination which to speak the truth is sometimes heated into a pleasing delirium with its own work subsided by degrees and doubt and diffidence succeeded A Play that might linger nine nights upon the Stage was not the object of the Author's ambition Whether he has been able to execute any thing better he has not considered for a long time nor has he now courage to determine He has often said to himself in the words of TULLY  Nihil hue nisi perfectum ingenio Elaboratum Industriâ afferri oportere  and after adopting in his own case so rigid a rule how shall he presume to say that the production of a summer can boast either of genius or the elaborate touches of industry  IN this irresolute state of mind the Author's respect for the Public who have done him upon former occasions very particular  honour increased his t'midity he was unwilling to appear a candidate for their favour when he was not sure of adding to their pleasure At present being to give an edition of such pieces as he has been able to produce he could not think of keeping back the only dramatic work left upon his hands He therefore sends it into the world an humble adventurer with one of his predecessors he says '  Va mon Enfant prens ta Fortune'  The Play amused him while he was engaged in the writing of it and should the candid Reader find an hour of leisure not entirely thrown away in the perusal the Author will not think his time altogether misemployed He now dismisses the Piece if not with indifference at least with resignation content to leave the honours of the Theatre to Writers of more ambition than he possesses

thus pursue my steps  Begone and leave me leave me to my woes  Arc  Yet Phaedra be advis'd  Phae  Presume no further  Advis'd by thee nolet your pliant king  Your king of Naxos to thy treach'rous counsels  Resign himself his people and his laws  Thou hast undone us all by thee we die  Yes Ariadne Phaedra Theseus all  All die by thee  Arc  Princess your fears are groundless  Your timorous fancy forms unjust suspicions  If you but knew me  Phae  O too well I know thee  This very morn 'tis fix'd yes here your king  Gives audience to th' Ambassador of Crete  Here in this palace here by your persuasion  He means to yield us to the rage of Minos  To my vindictive father's stern demand  Ere that I'll see your king here wait his coming  And counteract thy base ungen'rous counsel  Arc  This storm of passion bears your reason down  Let prudence guide thee In a night like this  Why quit your couch and to the whirlwind's rage  The vollied lightening and the war of nature  Why wilt thou thus commit thy tender frame  Thunder and lightning  Again that dreadful peal"Allgracious Powers  "What crime provokes your wrath must this fair island  "That long hath flourish'd in th' Aegean deep  "Must Naxos with her sons a blameless race  "Burn to the centre and the brawling waves  "Close o'er the wreck for ever  Another clap of thunder  "  Phae  Oh that burst  "Shoots horror to my soul  "  Arc  Thus through the night  "Hath the wild uproar shook the groaning isle  "Fierce rain and liquid fire in mingled torrents  "Came rushing o'er the land The wrath of Heaven  "Rides in the tempest Towers and sacred domes  "Fell in promiscuous ruin Ships were dash'd  "On pointed rocks or swallowed in the deep  "Destruction rages round" amidst the roar  When all things else when ev'n the fiercest natures  Shrink from the hideous ruin you alone  Walk through the storm with fierce with hagard mien  A form that suits the dreadful wild commotion  Phae  Yes with a heart in which the storm that rages  Surpasses all the horrors of the night  "Yes here I come supreme in misery  "I only wake to cares unknown to him  "Who treads secure the paths of humble life  "And thanks the gods for his obscure retreat  "For the blest shade in which their bounty plac'd him"  Phae  'Tis you have rais'd this tempest of the soul  You sir are minister you govern here  And bend at will an unsuspecting monarch  To thee he yields his oracie of state  And when with wrongs you have oppress'd mankind  'Tis the king's pleasure 'tis the royal will  Arc  Unjust ungenerous charge have you forgot  When first your vessel reach'd the coast of Naxos  You sued for leave to land upon the isle  To pray for shelter here Ere that we heard  Theseus was with you Theseus whom the state  Of Athens sent a sacrifice to Minos  A victim to absolve the annual tribute  Impos'd by conquest Ariadne's love  Her generous efforts to redeem the hero  Ev'n then were known at Periander's court  The wond'rous story on the wings of Fame  Had reach'd our Isle she pity'd and she lov'd him  Phae  She lov'd himYes she saw and she ador'd  Gods who could see the graces of his youth  His cause his innocence the hero's mien  Manly and firm yet soften'd by distress  Gods who could see him and not gaze entranc'd  In ecstacy and loveWhat have I said  My warmth too far transports meah beware  Aside  'Twas as you say she pity'd and she lov'd  Arc  She favour'd his escape you fled together  To ev'ry neighb'ring isle you wing'd your flight  You visited each realm with prayers and tears  Wearied each court All fear'd your father's power  You came to Naxos Periander's will  Your orator came forth Did not I then  Phae  You succour'd our distressthe tear of sympathy  Stood in your eye and you may boast your merit  You play'd it well sir  Arc  This ambiguous strain  But ill requites the offices of friendship  For you I watch'd the temper of the king  His ebbs and flows of passion in apt season  You landed here Thrice hath the waning moon  Conceal'd her light and thrice renew'd her orb  While you meantime have liv'd protected here  Each hour has seen your sister Ariadne  Rise in her charms and now with boundless sway  She reigns supreme in Periander's heart  Phae  True we have found protection from your king  Three months have pass'dbut in that time a statesman  May change his mind New views of interest  New plans of policy fair seeming motives  May give new principles  Arc  It is my first  My best ambition to relieve the wretched  You wrong me princess you had best retire  Phae  No Periander first shall hear my suit  Here will I wait his coming on the earth  Fall prostrate at his fect implore his mercy  Cling round his knees and never loose my hold  Till his heart melt and save us from destruction  Enter  THESEUS  The  What plaintive sorrow thro' the lonely palace  Alarms my lift'ning ear  Phae  That wellknown voice  Dispels my fears O Theseus how my heart  Bounds at thy lov'd approach and yet this day  Decides your doomArchon can tell you all  This day resigns you to my father's power  Here Periander has resolv'd to answer  Th' ambassador of Crete  The  Controul thy fears  Archon has serv'd me and I thank him for it  All will be well the king protects us still  Archon the storm that threaten'd hideous ruin  At length subsides The angry blast recalls  Its train of horrors Through the sev'ring clouds  Faint gleams of day disclose the face of things  The raging deep that rose in mountain billows  Sinks to repose The winds the waves are hush'd  From yon high tower that overhangs the bay  I view'd the ocean round No sail appears  No vessel cleaves the deep save one escap'd  From the wild uproar of the warring winds  That with it's shatter'd masts and lab'ring oars  Stems the rough tide and enters now the harbour  Phae  Another sail and enters now the harbour  From whence Who and what are they From what coast  Alas from Crete 'tis Minos sends my father's wrath  Pursues us still another embassy  Comes to demand us all  And banish ev'ry fear  Arc  Perhaps some vessel  Rich with the stores with busy commerce sends  From the adjacent isles on Naxos' coast  Now seeks a shelter from the roaring deep  I'll to the harbour Theseus be it thine  To pour o'er Phaedra's wees the balm of comfort  And hush her cares to peace From Crete I trust  The messengers of woe no more will come  To urge their stern demand  Exit  Phae  Go traitor go  Pernicious vile dissembler  The  Ah forbear  Phae  He seems a friend the surer to betray  Full well he knows that Ariadne's charms  Have wak'd a flame in Periander's heart  To that alliance with a statesman's craft  He stands a foe conceal'd He dre ds to see  On Naxos' throne a queen from Minos sprung  And therefore plans our ruin  "  The  Yet thy fancy  "Still arm'd against itself turns'pale and trembles  "At shadowy forms Were thy suspicions just  "Wherefore reveal them Why unguard thyself  "And lay each secret open to your foe  "With him whose rankling malice works unseen  "While smiles becalm his looks 'twere best pretend  "Not to perceive the lurking treachery  "Reproof but goads him and new whets his passions  "Till what was policy becomes revenge  "Detected villany can ne'er forgive  "  Phae  And must I fall in silence must we perish  "Abandon'd by ourselves tame willing victims  "Nor let the murd'rer hear one dying groan  "Must I behold him with his treach'rous arts  "A lurking foe nor pour my curses on him  "But poorly crouch and thank him for the blow  "Oh love like mine the love which you inspired  "That each day rises still to higher ardour  "Think'st thou that love like mine will calmly see thee  "Giv'n up a victim to my father's rage"  The  And think'st thou then that Archon is my foe  Phae  He is I know him well he means destruction  Th' ambassador of Crete will soon have audience  Archon concerted all Oh if my care  Could counteract his dark his sell designs  Then were I bless'd indeed When first you landed  A helpless victim on the Cretan sho  e  Full well you know soft pity touch'd my heart  And soon that tender pity chang'd to love  I wish'd to save you Ariadne's fortune  Gave her the clue that led you thro' the maze  Her zeal outran my speed but not my love  And would my fate allow me now to save thee  Then by that tie 'tis all my sister's claim  I then should prove me worthy of thy love  The  Deem me not gen'rous Phaedra deem me not  Form'd of such common clay so dead to beauty  As not to feel with transport at my heart  Thy powerful charms To Ariadne  I owe my life That boon demands respect  Demands my gratitude But love must spring  Spontaneous in the heart it's only source  Unmix'd with other motives than it's own  Unbrib'd unboughtabove all vulgar ties  Phae  And yet while ruin  The  Check this storm of passion  Nor think with abject fear that Periander  Will e'er resign us Ariadne's charms  Have touch'd his heart "His words his looks proclaim it  "In the soft tumult all his soul is lost  "He dwells for ever on the lov'd idea  "And with her beauty means to grace his throne  "  Phae  Archon abhors the union To prevent it  "His deep designs"  Hear what I shall disclose  And treasure it in sacred silence seal'd  Last night admitted to a private audience  Wrapt in the friendly mantle of the dark  Enter an  OFFICER  The  What would'st thou speak thy purpose  Of  At the harbour  That fronts the northern wave a ship from Athens  This moment is arriv'd  Phae  Relief from Athens  Of  Your presence there by all is loudly call'd for  The  Say to my friends I will attend them straight  Exit Officer  Phae  A ray of hope to gild the cloud of woe  The  Now PhaeDRA mark me Let thy fears subside  Last night when ev'ry care was lull'd to res't  No eye to trace my steps no conscious ear  To catch the sound then Periander granted  A private conference I unbosom'd to him  In confidence the secrets of my heart  To Ariadne I resign'd all claim  Renounc'd each tender passion Periander  No longer view'd me with a rival's eye  He promis'd his protection Ariadne  Has pow'rful charms and the king bears a heart  To beauty not impassive Joy and rapture  Spoke in his eye and purpled o'er his face  With vanity she'll hear a monarch's sighs  Proud of her sway A diadem will quench  Her former flame with glitt'ring splendor tempt her  And make the infidelity her own  Phae  But if she hears a sister dares dispute  A heart like thine  The  Trust to my prudent caution  That dang'rous secret I have skreen'd with care  Here it lies buried Periander thinks  A former flame kindled long since in Greece  Preys on my heart with slow consuming fires  But harkbeware this way some hasty step  Enter  ARCHON  Arc  The Greeks now issue on the

your embassy  Al  In fairest terms  Of friendly greeting Minos sir by me  Imparts his rightful claim He knows the justice  The moderation that directs your counsels  He knows though oft' in the embattled field  Your sword has reek'd with blood your wisdom still  Respects the rights of kings respects the laws  That hold the nations in the bonds of peace  To you sir he appeals he claims his daughters  His rebel daughters leagu'd against his crown  He claims the victim from his vengeance rescued  Rescued by fraud by Ariadne's fraud  And here at Naxos shelter'd from his justice  A sov'reign and a parent claims his rights  You will respect the father and the king  Perian  Of Minos' virtues his renown in arms  His plan of laws that spread around the blessings  Of sacred order and of social life  Laws which even kings obey the world has heard  With praise with gratitude All must revere  The legislator and the friend of man  But in the sorrows that distract his house  Is it for me with rash mistaken zeal  To interpose my care is it for me  To judge his daughter's conduct What decree  What law of mine what policy of Naxos  Have they offended All who roam the deep  Find in my ports a safe a sure retreat  Should I comply with your proud bold request  The hardy genius of this seagirt isle  Would call it tyranny and power usurp'd  'Tis law and not the sov'reign's will that here  Controuls directs and animates the state  Al  The law that favours wrongs and shelters guilt  Subverts all order Through her hundred cities  All Crete will mourn your answer With regret  Minos will hear it By pacific means  He would prevail by justice not the sword  But Sir if justice if a righteous cause  At your tribunal list their voice in vain  I see the gath'ring storm I see the dangers  That hover round your isle and o'er the scene  Humanity lets fall the natural tear  The sons of Crete a brave a gen'rous race  Active and ardent in their monarch's cause  Already grasp the sword "I see the ocean  "White with unnumber'd sails your coast your harbours  "Beleaguer'd close I see the martial bands  "Planting their banners on the wellfought shore  "Your hills your plains glitt'ring with hostile arms  "Your cities sack'd your villages on fire  "While from its source each river swoln with carnage  "Runs crimson to the main I see the conqueror  "Urge to your capital with rapid march  "And desolation cov'ring all the land  "Still Sir you may prevent this waste of blood  "Your timely wisdom"  Perian  The scope appears  Of your fair seeming message And does Minos  Fam'd as he is in arms say does he hope  With proud imperious sway to lord it o'er  The Princes of the world And does he mean  To write his laws in blood And must the nations  Crouch at his nod Must I upon my throne  Look pale and tremble when your fancied Jove  Grasps the unlifted thunder Tell your king  He knows my warlike nameknows we have met  In fields of death oppos'd in adverse ranks  Braving each other's lancehe knows the sinew  With which this arm can wield the deathful blade  Or send the missive javelin on the foe  Thirsting for bloodGo bear my answer back  And say besides that Naxos boasts a race  Rough as their clime by liberty inspir'd  Of stubborn nerve and unsubmitting spirit  Who laugh to scorn a foreign master's claim  You've spoke your embassy and have our answer  Al  Unwilling I bear hence th' ungrateful tidings  Exit  Perian  Tomorrow's sun shall see him spread his sails  He must not linger here  Arc  Your pardon Sir  This answer may provoke the powers of Crete

the sweet infection to his soul  Tis as I fear'd  Aside  Perhaps by mild remonstrance  We may gain time and by the specious arts  Of treaty and debate prevent the war  Perian  You know my orders see them straight obeyed  Exit  Arc  Perian  Yes Ariadne from the inclement storms  Of thy rude fortune it is fix'd to shield thee  And soften all thy woes Her father then  When with her milder ray

appall'd with fear  "Theseus I never saw thee thus before"  The  Our days of rapture and of promis'd joy  Far hence are fled  "  Ari  No on their rosy wings  "The hours of joy and ever new delight  "Come smiling on Is this a time for fear  "When all is gay serenity around us  "And fortune opens all her brightest scenes  "  The  Too soon that scene with low'ring clouds deform'd  "Will show the sad reverse" You little know  How Periander with resistless fury  Breaks through all bounds His passions scorn restraint  And what he wills his vehemence of soul  Pursues with fierce with unremitting ardour  To his wild fury all must yield obedience  Ari  His reign has ever been both mild and just  Fair virtue like some god that rules the storm  Still calms the warring elements within him  And moderation with her golden curb  Guides all his actions  The  Yet there is an impulse  Which with the whirlwind's unresisted rage  Roots up each virtue and lays waste the soul  Love reigns a lawless tyrant in his heart  For thee he sighs and sure that matchless beauty  May well inflame the passions of a prince  Who with a diadem can deck thy brow  Ari  Too well he knows the ties that bind us both  Knows you're all truth all constancy and love  He knows the flame my virgin sighs have own'd  Knows that for thee I left my native land  Fled from my friends and from my father's palace  And gave up all for thee And thinks he now  His throne his diadem his purple pomp  Have charms of power to lure me from thy arms  He knows his vows are lost in air Thy heart  Is Ariadne's throne  The  "His

people  "The adopted heir the rising sun of Crete"  The  By yielding me his rival is destroy'd  And by that act his proud ambition hopes  To sooth your father's irritated pride  And mould him to his wish  Ari  Can Periander  Harbour that black intent "and does he mean  "To prove at first a villain and a murderer  "And then aspire to Ariadne's love"  No Theseus no he will not stoop so vilely  I've heard you oft' commend him oft' my sister  Employs whole hours with rapture in his praise  He is her constant theme Her partial voice  Ev'n above thine exalts his fav'rite name  "She dwells on each

maiden coyness veil'd and pines in love"  Beauty like her's may fire a monarch's heart  And Periander without shame or guilt  Without a crime may woe her to his arms  To see her happy to behold my Phaedra  Crown'd with a monarch's and a people's love  Would be the pride of Ariadne's heart  The  Oh it were misery the worst of woes  Aside  Ari  Why do you start why that averted look  If you
