 ALONZO  A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS As it is performed at the THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  Et mentem strinxit patriae pietatis imago  VIRGIL  LONDON Printed for T BECKET in the Strand MDCCLXXIII  Prince One Shilling and Sixpence  ADVERTISEMENT  THE author of the following Tragedy has in his former attempts of the same kind avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication or preface His chief reason for declining this common mode of appearing before the public was the necessity which it would lay him under of speaking concerning himself and his works The success of Alonzo calls upon him to depart from his former plan and to break that silence which might now be reckoned arrogant and even ungrateful to those from whom he in a great measure derives his success  He embraces with pleasure this occasion to acknowledge his obligations to THE MANAGERS of the theatre whose friendly anxious and active zeal he hath so often experienced TO THE PERFORMERS who have so strenuously contended with each other in their very generous endeavours to embellish the representation of the piece To MRS BARRYbut the public voice has exalted HER above his praise Yet he claims the merit of  having before others observed her now allowed and unrivalled excellency From the colour of the dawn he foretold the brightness of the day  For MRS BARRY he wrote the part of Ormisinda and the most flattering circumstance to him in the success of his play is the universal opinion vouched not only by the loudest applause that ever shook the stage but by the greatest effusion of tears that the ACTRESS so much exalted THE CHARACTER that she exceeded all imagination and reached the summit of perfection  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr PALMER  WHILST ardent Zeal for India's Reformation  Hath fired the Spirit of a generous Nation  Whilst Patriots of presented Lacks complain  And Courtiers Bribery to Excess arraign  The Maxims of Bengal still rule the Stage  The Poets are your Slaves from Age to Age  Like Eastern Princes in this House you sit  The Soubahs and Nabobs of suppliant Wit  Each Bard his Present brings when he draws near  With Prologue first he sooths your gracious Ear  We hope your Clemency will shine to Day  For tho' despotic gentle in your Sway  These conscious Walls if they cou'd speak wou'd tell  How seldom by your Doom a Poet fell  Your Mercy oft suspends the Critics Laws  Your Hearts are partial to an Author's Cause  Pleas'd with such Lords content with our Condition  Against your Charter we will ne'er petition  If certain Folks should send us a Committee  Like that which lately visited the City  Who without special Leave of our Directors  At the Stage Door shou'd enter as Inspectors  Altho' their Hearts were arm'd with triple Brass  Thro' our resisting Scenes they could not pass  Lyons and Dragons too keep watch and ward  Witches and Ghosts the awful entrance guard  Heroes who mock the pointed Sword are here  And desperate Heroines who know no Fear  If as Rinaldo stout each Man should prove  To brave the Terrors of the inchanted Grove  Here on this Spot the Center of our State  Here on this very Spot they'd meet their Fate  The Prompter gives the Sign and down they go  Alive descending to the Shades below  To you whose Empire still may Heav'n maintain  Who here by antient Right and Custom reign  Our Lions couch our Dragons prostrate fall  Witches and Ghosts obey your potent Call  Our Heroines smile on you with all their Might  Our boldest Heroes tremble in your Sight  Even now with anxious Hearts they watch your Eyes  Should you but srown even brave  ALONZO  flies

_THIS roll contains the secret of my life  And of the state My marriage with Alonzo  The story of my son my injured child  Bred in a desert tho' the heir of Spain  To thee my faithful friend my lov'd Teresa  This precious record I commit Oh keep it  From sight of human eye till better times  For still I hope that better times may come  Tho' not to me to this afflicted land  My hand hath signed it and my act to day  Shall give it faith and credence with mankind  This will explain the mystery of my fate  And tell the world why Ormisinda died  Gives the writing  TERESA  Do not too soon despair  ORMISINDA  I wait the last  Decisive moment But to guard my soul  Against the sallies of a rash despair  Against the weakness which attends surprise  I have forecast whatever may befall  And fram'd to the event my firm resolve  This is the day appointed for the combat  Between a Moorish and a Christian knight  To end the wars of Spain and fix the fate  Of the contending nations  TERESA  Antient times  If tales of antient times may be believ'd  Have known such combats In her infant state  Against her rival Alba Rome was pledg'd  As now Asturia is But later times  Afford no parallel  ORMISINDA  There never was  Nor will there ever while the world endures  Be found a parallel to my distress  I am the victor's prizewhoe'er prevails  He gains the princess and the crown of Spain  Such is the solemn treaty sworn confirm'd  By every rite which either nation owns  Mean while I am Alonzo's wedded wife  I am a motherby the false Alonzo  Who from his hate to me abandons Spain  Which he alone can save No other arm  Can match Mirmallon's force Proud of his strength  Already in the lists the Moor exults  Secure of victory The setting sun  Concludes the dreadful period of suspence  And death alone from infamy can save me  TERESA  He yet may come Far in the Nubian wilds  That guard the secret sources of the Nile  Velasco found the chief The wind of spring  The constant East this year forgot its season  And only since this moon her light renew'd  Began to blow upon the western shore  On that I build a hope  ORMISINDA  I have no hope  Review the story of my life Teresa  And by the past conjecture of the future  First my lamented brother blindly led  By proud Ramirez quarrell'd with Alonzo  Then by Alonzo's sword Ramirez fell  For that offence to banishment condemn'd  Alonzo won me to accept his hand  Before he left this kingdom Since that time  What I have suffer'd Heav'n and you can tell  It was the fifth a memorable day  After our marriage when he fail'd to come  At the appointed place to meet his bride  Then' midst my fear anxiety and sorrow  For only death I thought or dangerous harm  Could keep him from my arms amaz'd I heard  That he was gone for Asia To this hour  Ev'n to this present hour no cause assign'd  But these distracted lines long after sent  "Thou never shalt behold Alonzo more  "The foul foul cause thy guilty conscience knows"  My conscience knows no cause so help me Heav'n  Now in my utmost need this dreadful day  When I must struggle with despair and Death  To keep myself a chaste a blameless wife  And to my silent grave the secret bear  That my dear son and his may live to wield  The sceptre of his fathers  TERESA  To this hour  Thy husband knows not that he is a father  ORMISINDA  His ears his eyes are shut Oft' have I sent  Letters that would have piere'd an heart of stone  Pleading for pity begging but to know  Wherein I had unwittingly offended  But every letter with unbroken seal  To me return'd He will not read one word  From my detested hand  TERESA  'Tis very strange  And much unlike the way of other men  For tho' they are inconstant in their love  There is a course and process in the change  Ardent at first their ardor lasts not long  With easy full secure possession cloy'd  Their passion palls and cold indifference comes  As chilly autumn steals on summer's prime  Making the green leaf yellow Then it is  That some new beauty takes their roving eyes  And fires their fancy with untasted charms  But in a moment from excess of love  To the extreme of hate Alonzo pass'd  Without a cause Nor did another come  Between thee and the current of his love  'Tis moonstruck madness or the dire effect  Of incantation charm compulsive spell  By magie fasten'd on his wretched soul  It can be nothing else  ORMISINDA  Whate'er it is  He shuns all womankind His life is spent  In war and in devotion When the field  Is won the warrior lays aside his spear  Takes up the pilgrim's staff and all alone  Obscur'd in homely weeds he bends his course  To some remote religious holy place  Where he exceeds the strictest penitent  In penances severe and sad austerity  Sometimes in deeper melancholy wrapt  He loaths the sight of man and to the cliffs  Of hoary Caucasus or Atlas flies  Where all the dreary winterhe remains  And desolate delights in desolation  My faithful fervant Juan saw him once  Upon the ledge of Atlas on a rock  Beside the empty channel of a brook  He stood and gaz'd intent a cataract  Which as it tumbled from a cliff the blast  Had caught midway and froze before it fell  Juan drew near and call'd He turn'd about  Look'd at him for a space then wav'd him back  And mounting swiftly sunk behind the hill  Wan was his face and like a statue pale  His eye was wild and haggard Oh Teresa  Amidst my woes my miseries my wrongs  My bosom bleeds for him  TERESA  Something there is  Mysterious and unfathomable here  Which passes human wisdom to divine  The hand of fate is on the curtain now  Within my breast a firm persuasion dwells  That in the lists Alonzo will appear  Behold in haste the king your father comes  And seems the messenger of welcome tidings  Enter the  KING  KING  I come in this alarming hour my child  To pour a ray of comfort on thy heart  A valiant Moor once captive of my sword  And ever since my firm but secret friend  Acquaints me that a champion is at hand  Shunning those honors which the Moors would pay  Dark and reserv'd he travels thro' their towns  Without a name I judge it is Alonzo  For the description best accords with him  Scorning his foes offended with his friends  Shrouded in anger and in deep disdain  Like some prime planet in eclipse he moves  Gaz'd at and fear'd  ORMISINDA  It is It is Alonzo  Welcome most welcome in whatever shape  The hero comes to save his native land  To save the honor of the Christian name  And o'er the fading crescent of the Moor  Exalt the holy cross  KING  And ev'n as thine  Is the consenting voice of all the land  The hope of Spain on brave Alonzo rests  In this I see the ruling hand of heav'n  Which to its own eternal purpose leads  By winding paths the steps of erring man  Painful it were to speak of those events  Sad and disastrous which have laid us low  Unjustly was Alonzo banish'd hence  And happily the hero now returns  For since my son your valiant brother fell  With an impartial mind I have enquir'd  And trac'd the story of Alonzo's birth  He is the offspring of our antient kings  The rightful heir of Riccaredo's line  Called the Catholic who reign'd in Spain  Before the first invasion of the Moors  Lost in the gen'ral wreck buried and hid  Beneath the ruins of a fallen state  Obscure unknown the royal infant lay  When I indignant of a foreign yoke  In wild Asturia rose against the Moors  The righteous cause prevail'd the baffled foe  Retir'd and left us and our mountains free  The grateful people chose their leader king  I knew not then nor did my people know  Ought of Alonzo  ORMISINDA  I have heard him own  The justice of thy title to command  And rule the state thy valor had restor'd  Enough he said remain'd for him to conquer  The fertile provinces of ample Spain  Which still the Moor usurps  KING  Of all mankind  He is the champion whom my soul desires  This day to fight for Spain and for my aughter  Not only for his great renown in arms  But for his birth his lineage and his blood  If his unconquer'd arm in fight prevails  The antient monarchy shall rise again  In all its splendor and extent of empire  The streams of royal blood divided now  Shall roll a tide united thro' the land  ORMISINDA  Thy heart dilates with pleasing hopes my father  And fond anticipates its own desire  But who can tell the purpose of Alonzo  His strange approach no friendly aspect bears  He comes the foe determin'd of the Moors  But not to us a friend  KING  Of that no fear  I know him proud impetuous and fierce  Haughty of heart and high of hand Too prompt  On all occasions to appeal to arms  But he was ever gentle to my daughter  The proud Alonzo bow'd the knee to thee  At his departure I observ'd thy grief  And in my mind  A trumpet sounds  ORMISINDA  What means that shout of war  KING  The trumpet sounds to arms  Enter a messenger  MESSENGER  Thy presence Sir  Is at the camp requir'd Both nations arm  And rush to battle Loud the Moors complain  Of violated faith A Spanish knight  They say has broke the treaty and attack'd  Their bands of peace secure  KING  'Tis basely done  Command my guards to meet me at the gate  Farewel  Exit the King  TERESA  Who can this headlong warrior be  Too well Alonzo knows the laws of war  Too much reveres the treaty feal'd and sworn  To make a rash attempt upon the Moors  ORMISINDA  If it is he 'tis no deliberate act  No treacherous intention to assail  The Moors unguarded Yet it may be he  My mind misgives me that it is Alonzo  Ill would his swelling spirit brook the sight  Of Moorish tents and arms on yonder plain  If as he pass'd one slighting word was dropt  With tenfold scorn to that he would reply  Nor hesitate alone to draw his sword  Amidst an host of Moors  TERESA  The clamor sinks  Whate'er it was the tumult is appeas'd  And now what does my Ormisinda think  Of my predictions  ORMISINDA  Oh my dear Teresa  Thy fond desire to chear my hopeless heart  Makes thee forever to my mind present  The fairest side of things  TERESA  Ha dost thou doubt  Still of his coming  ORMISINDA  No I think 'tis he  But hope and fear alternate sway my mind  Like light and shade upon a waving field  Coursing each other when the flying clouds  Now hide and now reveal the sun of heav'n  I tremble for the issue of the combat  And if my Lord should as I hope prevail  I tremble for myself Afraid to see  Tho' sick with strong impatience to behold him  And learn why he forsook his Ormisinda  He says I know the cause Oh most unjust  Was it because I lov'd him to excess  Altho' his title shook my father's throne  Was it because I join'd my fate to his  And fondly chose to wed a banish'd man  For such are my demerits  TERESA  'Tis but vain  Thus to torment thyself and rack thy mind  With sad conjectures at a time like this  When the reality will soon be known  ORMISINDA  I know one thing that's real 'tis a fault  An imperfection which I cannot cure  Sixteen long years are past since I beheld him  And grief and care those tenants that deface  The sad and weary mansion they inhabit  Have dwelt with me Am I not alter'd much  The ghost and shadow of what once I was  TERESA  No Ormisinda I perceive no change  That in the least impairs thy lovely form  The beam that gilds the early morn of youth  Yields to the splendor of a riper hour  The rose that was so fair in bud is blown  And grief and care tho' they have dwelt with thee  Have left no traces of their visitation  But an impression sweet of melancholy  Which captivates the soul Unskilful they  Who dress the queen of love in wanton smiles  Brightest she shines amidst a show'r of tears  The graces that adorn her beauty most  Are sostness sensibility and pity  ORMISINDA  Oh how ingenious thou art Teresa  How subtle to elude my simple fears  Still they advance and gather round my heart  If nothing can recal Alonzo's love  Let him but own his son and I'll renounce  The title of his wife and of a queen  Then in a convent hide me and my sorrows  The saddest sister of the holy train  Whose watchful zeal prevents the midnight bell  Shall find me kneeling on the marble floor  Oh it will be the luxury of grief  To weep incessant in the vaulted cell  To lift my hands and send my vows to heav'n  Invoking ev'ry power that dwells above  To guard and bless my husband and my son  Perhaps some friend most likely my Teresa  When I am quite forsaken and forgot  By all the world will still remember me  Will come and tell me of Alonzo's wars  Tell how my boy in his first battle fought  At once the rival of his father's fame  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Enter the  KING  and a Moorish officer with Moors and Spaniards  KING  HAMET impartial justice shall be done  And thou I know as justly wilt report it  Thou art the friend of peace  HAMET  Therefore I sought  This office for in yonder camp O King  Some counsellors there are who urg'd the Caliph  To take advantage of this fair occasion  And hold the treaty void  KING  That I believe  But with your aid I hope to disappoint them  My guards are gone to bring th' offender hither  HAMET  Yonder they come and thro' their files I see  A prisoner  Enter guards with a young man armed  KING  Ha by Heaven he's but a youth  A beardless boy and like a woman fair  He moves my pity much Unhappy youth  To the prisoner  Art thou the chief of that unruly band  Who broke the treaty and assail'd the Moors  YOUTH  No chief no leader of a band am I  The leader of a band insulted me  And those he led basely assail'd my life  With bad success indeed If selfdefence  Be criminal O King I have offended  KING  To Hamet    With what a noble confidence he speaks  See what a spirit thro' his blushes breaks  Observe him Hamet  HAMET  I am fix'd upon him  KING  Didst thou alone engage a band of Moors  And make such havoc Sure it cannot be  Recall thyscattered thoughts Nothing advance  Which proof may overthrow  YOUTH  What I have said  No proof can overthrow Where is the man  Who speaking from himself not from reports  And rumors idle will stand forth and say  I was not single when the Moors attack'd me  HAMET  I will not be that man tho' I confess  That I came hither to accuse thee Youth  And to demand thy punishmentI brought  The tale our soldiers told  YOUTH  The tale was false  HAMET  I thought it true but thou hast shook my faith  The seal of truth is on thy gallant form  For none but cowards lie  KING  Thy story tell  With every circumstance which may explain  The seeming wonder how a single man  In such a strife could stand  YOUTH  'Twill cease to be  A wonder when thou hear'st the story told  This morning on my road to Oviedo  A while I halted near a Moorish post  Of the commander I enquir'd my way  And told my purpose that I came to see  The famous combat With a scornful smile  With taunting words and gestures he replied  Mocking my youth Advis'd me to return  Back to my father's house and in the ring  To dance with boys and girls He added too  That I should see no combat That no knight  Of Spain durst meet the champion of the Moors  Incens'd I did indeed retort his scorn  The quarrel grew apace and I defied him  To a green hill which rose amidst the plain  An arrow's flight or farther from his post  Alone we sped at once we drew we fought  The Moorish captain fell Enrag'd his men  Flew to revenge his death Secure they came  Each with his utmost speed Those who came first  Single I met and slew More wary grown  The rest together join'd and all at once  Assail'd me Then I had no hopes of life  But suddenly a troop of Spaniards came  And charg'd my foes who did not long sustain  The shock but fled and carried to their camp  That false report which thou O King hast heard  KING  Now by my sceptre and my sword I swear  Thou art a noble youth An angel's voice  Could not command a more implicit faith  Than thou from me hast gain'd What think'st thou Hamet  Is he not greatly wrong'd  HAMET  By Allah yes  The voice of truth and innocence is bold  And never yet could guilt that tone assume  I take my leave impatient to return  And satisfy my friends that this brave youth  Was not th' aggressor  KING  I expect no less  From gen'rous Hamet    Exit  Hamet  and Moors    KING  Tell me wondrous Youth  For much I long to know what is thy name  Who are thy parents Since the Moor prevail'd  Thecottage and the cave have oft' conceal'd  From hostile hate the noblest blood of Spain  Thy spirit speaks for thee Thou art a shoot  Of some illustrious stock some noble house  Whose fortunes with their falling country fell  YOUTH  Alberto is my name I draw my birth  From Catalonia in the mountains there  My father dwells and for his own domains  Pays tribute to the Moor He was a soldier  Oft' I have heard him of your battles speak  Of Cavadonga's and Olalles' field  But ever since I can remember ought  His chief employment and delight have been  To train me to the use and love of arms  In martial exercise we past the day  Morning and evening still the theme was war  He bred me to endure the summer's heat  And brave the winter's cold To swim across  The headlong torrent when the shoals of ice  Drove down the stream To rule the fiercest steed  That on our mountains run No savage beast  The forest yields that I have not encounter'd  Meanwhile my bosom beat for nobler game  I long'd in arms to meet the foes of Spain  Oft I implor'd my father to permit me  Before the truce was made to join the host  He said it must not be I was too young  For the rude fervice of these trying times  KING  Did he permit you now  ALBERTO  A strange adventure  Forc'd me from home Not many days ago  When hunting in the woods I heard a voice  A woman's voice calling aloud for help  I rush'd into the thicket there I saw  A moorish Lord for brutal licence fam'd  Who shamefully abus'd a rural maid  Of Spanish race I free'd her from his arms  The moor spake not a word but mad with rage  Snatch'd up his lance which stood against a tree  And at me flew I turn'd his point aside  And with a slender javelin pierc'd his heart  I hasten'd home but did not find my father  Nor was it sase to wait for his return  I took the fairest armour in the hall  And hither bent my course The rest thou know'st  KING  Thou art a prodigy and fill'ft my mind  With thoughts profound and expectation high  When in a nation humbled by the will  Of Providence beneath an haughty foe  A person rises up by nature rear'd  Sublime above the level of mankind  Like that bright bow the hand of the most High  Bends in the wat'ry cloud He is the sign  Of prosp'rous change and interposing Heav'n  And thou if right I read  Enter Messenger  MESSENGER  The champion Sir  Who comes to fight for Spain is near at hand  One of our scouts has seen him and his trian  But brings a strange report which damps the heart  Of every Spaniard It is not Alonzo  KING  What say'st thou God of heaven Not Alonzo  Who is he then  MESSENGER  That is not fully known  Clad in the flowing vesture of the east  A Persian turban on his head he wears  Yet he's a christian knight To mark his falth  Holy and adverse to Mohammed's law  Before his steps a silken banner borne  Streams in the wind and shews a golden cross  KING  Send out another scout  MESSENGER  There is not time  To go and to return  KING  Begone begone  And let me be obey'd Alas my hopes  Are vanish'd like a dream  ALBERTO  I grieve to see  The king afflicted  KING  Ah Thou dost not know  How deep these tidings strike  ALBERTO  Is not the king  Free to accept or to refuse the aid  This stranger offers  KING  If I am what then  ALBERTO  Be not offended Sir at my presumption  For from my heart I speak a loyal heart  True to my sov'reign and my native land  If this is not Alonzo why should he  Or any stranger fight the cause of Spain  Are there not warriors born of Spanish race  Who court the combat  KING  To my words attend  The Moorish champion is of great renown  In stature like the giant race of old  Like Anak's true or Titan's fabled sons  Against the foe nor sword nor spear he lifts  But in his might secure a mace he wields  Whose sway resistless breaks both shield and arm  And crushes head and helmet Thus he fights  Whose fatal prowess turn'd the doubtful scale  Of three successive battles He is deem'd  Invincible but by Alonzo's arm  Therefore our warriors tho' they know no fear  No fear of ought that can themselves befal  Anxious for Spain to great Alonzo yield  And on his valour rest  ALBERTO  Oft' have I heard  My father speak of brave Alonzo's deeds  What can withhold him when his country calls  Perhaps the last of combats he has fought  And in the silent tomb the hero rests  But since he's absent from whatever cause  O let no stranger knight his place assume  To bring dishonour on the Spanish name  If this gigantic champion of the Moors  Clad in the glory of his battles won  Dazzles the warriors and confounds their valour  Let me tho' young in arms the combat claim  On me his fame has no impression made  I'll meet the giant with a fearless heart  It beats for battle now Oft have I kill'd  The wolf the boar and the wild mountain bull  For sport and pastime Shall this Moorish dog  Resist me fighting in my country's cause  KING  By heaven and earth thou mov'st me much thy words  Have stirr'd the embers of my youthful fire  Thou mak'st me wish I could recal those days  When of an age like thine and not unlike  To thee in face and form I rais'd the spear  Against the Moor in Cava's bloody field  Then by my hand the great Alchammon fell  The strength and pillar of the Caliph's host  Then I was sit to meet Mirmallon's arm  But now my hairs are grey my steps are slow  My sword descending breaks the shield no more  Our foes have known it long  ALBERTO  O King thou art  Thy country's great deliv'rer and the sole  Restorer of the state Pelagio's fame  Shall never die But let thy counsel now  As oft thy valour save this land from shame  Let not a foreign warrior take the field  And snatch the glory from the lance of Spain  KING  My voice alone cannot determine that  The council sit assembled near the lists  To them I will present thee If this knight  Unknown who from that distant egion comes  Where the bright sun lights up his golden lamp  Bears not some high preeminence about him  Which marks him out our surest safest choice  My voice is for a Spaniard and for thee  ALBERTO  Upon my knees that ne'er were bow'd before  To mortal man I thank thee  KING  Rise Alberto  To me no thanks are due A greater King  The King of Kings I deem hath chosen thee  To be the champion of his law divine  Against the InsidelIf not for this  For some great purpose sure thou art ordain'd  Bred in the desert and by heav'n endued  With force and valor marvellously great  Conducted by a hand unseen thyself  Not knowing whither and this day produc'd  Before the nations  ALBERTO  Ah my soul's on fire  Should such a glorious destiny be mine  May I intreat to go without delay  I fear some gallant warrior may step forth  And claim the fight before me  KING  Stay Sebastian  And to my daughter tell what has befall'n    Exeunt  King  and  Alberto  Manet  SEBASTIAN  How many changes mark this awful day  What must the Princess suffer Well I know  That she above all others wish'd Alonzo  Enter  ORMISINDA  and  TERESA  TERESA  It is a false report In times like these  The minds of men are credulous and weak  To rumor's shifting blast they bow and bend  Like corn of slender reed to every wind  Thou know'st that from the East Alonzo comes  Might not the hasty messenger mistake  For him some turban'd warrior of his train  ORMISINDA  O good Sebastian canst thou tell me ought  Is it Alonzo  SEBASTIAN  If report speaks truth  And so the King believes 'tis not Alonzo  ORMISINDA  Then I am lost Teresa  TERESA  Hast thou heard  If not Alonzo who this stranger is  SEBASTIAN  His garb bespeaks him native of the East  But from whatever clime the warrior comes  I hope my Princess that he comes in vain  Another warrior and of Spanish race  Now claims the combat for his native land  ORMISINDA  Of Spanish race Who is this Knight of Spain  SEBASTIAN  A wonder never was his equal seen  For daring valour and address in arms  He has not yet attain'd the prime of youth  His look partakes more of the boy than man  But he hath vanquish'd men This day the Moors  Have felt his hand  ORMISINDA  Ha Is it he Sebastian  Who was the author of the late alarm  SEBASTIAN  The same  ORMISINDA  And whence does this young hero come  SEBASTIAN  From Catalonia In the deserts there  His sire obscure tho' once a warrior dwells  ORMISINDA  From Catalonia In the desert bred  Teresa All that's possible I fear  What if this youth  TERESA  To Ormisinda    O think how many youths  Of Spanish race in Catalonia dwell  Be recollected whilst I ask Sebastian  A question that at once all doubt resolves  To Sebastian  Has this youth no name Hast thou not heard  How he is call'd  SEBASTIAN  He calls himself Alberto  ORMISINDA  Mother of God  TERESA  To Her    BewareThe Princess grieves  To Sebastian  That Spain depriv'd of great Alonzo's aid  Should rest her safety on a stripling's arm  ORMISINDA  No judge of warriors or of combats I  But sure this youth tho' ne'er so brave and bold  Of tender years who has not reach'd his prime  Is most unfit to cope with strong Mirmallon  SEBASTIAN  Heroes must not be judg'd by common rules  Irregular like comets in their course  Who can compute the period when they shine  Lady If thou had'st seen this gallant youth  If thou had'st heard him when oblig'd to speak  In selfdefence he told his wond'rous deed  As if he though them nothing Thy faint heart  Would from his fire have caught the flame of hope  Thou would'  t even as thy royal father did  Believe he was created and ordain'd  By Heav'n supreme the champion of his country  TERESA  Sebastian go and find this gallant youth  Tell him the Princess partial to the brave  Desires his presence  SEBASTIAN  Gladly I obey    Exit  SEBASTIAN  ORMISINDA  He's gone Now I may speak My son my son  My hope my comfort in despair and death  The only star in my dark sky that shone  Must thy unhappy mother live to see  Thy light extinguish'd I will not permit  This most unequal combat I'll proclaim  My fatal story and declare his birth  TERESA  Think what must follow Absolute perdition  ORMISINDA  Is not his death perdition Can be meet  The Moor and live How should his tender youth  Resist the giant who has overthrown  Squadrons entire and trampled on the necks  Of firmest warriors  TERESA  'Tis not yet decreed  That he shall fight the Moor The stranger knight  Who was at first mistaken for Alonzo  Comes not so far without a name in arms  To gain the suffrage of the Peers of Spain  When once that name is known  ORMISINDA  Teresa no  My fate has still one even tenor held  From bad to worse When I had fram'd my mind  To one disaster then a greater came  I had made death familiar to my thoughts  I could embrace the spectre like a friend  But still I kept a corner of my heart  Safe and untouch'd My dearest child was there  Amidst the ruins of the wife and queen  The mother stood secure O thou Alonzo  If yet thine eyes behold the light of day  What sorrow and remorse must be thy portion  When thou shalt hearNow promise me Teresa  That when my son and I are laid in dust  For each event accelerates our doom  Thou wilt seek out and find this cruel man  Tell him how Spain the kingdom of his fathers  By him deserted was for ever lost  How his forsaken wife in honour died  But that's not muchfor me he will not mourn  Then tell him of is son to wring his heart  Truly describe the boy how brave he was  How beautiful how from the cloud obscure  In which his careful mother had involv'd him  He burst the champion of his native land  Then tell him how the springing hero fell  a stronger arm fighting for Spain  And for his mother fighting with the foe  His father should have fought and could have vanquish'd  TERESA  Sebastian comes  Enter  SEBASTIAN  SEBASTIAN  All is revers'd again  The stranger knight is for Abdallah know  The Persian prince Alonzo's chosen friend  His only equal in the strife of arms  To him the combat is decided  ORMISINDA  I know  His story well he is the Sophy's son  The eldest born and Persia's rightful heir  But by his mother's zeal a Christian bred  True to his faith he lost his father's throne  What says he of Alonzo  SEBASTIAN  Sent by him  The brave Abdallah comes to fight for Spain  They march'd together from the falls of Nile  To Damietta There a wound receiv'd  In Asia's wars broke out and forc'd Alonzo  Full of regret in Egypt to remain  His friend for him appears The king they father  With all his peers in honour of the prince  Go forth to meet him  ORMISINDA  Hast thou seen Alberto  SEBASTIAN  I have and told him what I had in charge  Then hasten'd hither to report these tidings  At which Alberto droops  TERESA  Return I pray  To my apartment guide the young Alberto  The princess will be there    Exit  Sebastian  Did not I say  Alonzo never would abandon Spain  Abdallah comes to conquer in his name  Now I can read the characters of fate  And spell the will of Heav'n This boy of yours  Will win your husband back When he beholds  The image of his valour so express  His heart will melt The husband and the father  Will rush upon him with a flood of joy  ORMISINDA  Is he not like him Mark his coming forth  Behold Alonzo in his daring son  Full of the spirit of his warlike sire  His birth unknown he felt his princely mind  Advanc'd undaunted on the edge of war  And claim'd the post of danger for his own  TERESA  A mother's tongue cannot exceed the truth  In praising him There never was a prince  Since old Iberia first excell'd in arms  Broke out with so much lustre on mankind  But in this interview with prudence check  The transport of affection from thy son  Cautions conceal the secret of his birth  Safest he is while to himself unknown  ORMISINDA  How could his faithful guardian let him go  Perhaps that faithful guardian lives no more  TERESA  Alberto will inform thee  ORMISINDA  Not Alberto  Alonzo is his name I go to meet him  Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A view of the country near the city  Enter  ABDALLAH  O CITY once the seat of all I lov'd  O hills and dales haunts ofmy youthful days  O scenes well known unalter'd you remain  But I approach you with an alter'd mind  Hate what I lov'd and loath what I desir'd  Intolerable state My soul is void  A chaos without form Why nature why  Art thou so watchful o'er the brutal tribes  And yet so careless of the human race  By certain instinct beasts and birds discern  Their proper food For them the fairest fruit  Untouch'd if pois'nous withers on the bough  But man by a fair outside still deceiv'd  And by his boasted reason more betray'd  Gives the affection of his soul to beauty  Devours the deadly bane  Enter  VELASCO  My Lord Thy people  Where thou commanded'st halt and wait thy coming  ABDALLAH  'Tis well I wish'd to speak with thee alone  Velasco tho' to thee but little known  I did in part reveal my secret soul  Told thee the feign'd Abdallah was Alonzo  Further than that thou hast not sought to know  Tho' many a lonely hour we two have worn  On sea and shore that some men would have thought  Most opportune  VELASCO  My Lord There are some men  Who having once been trusted with a little  Avail themselves of that some more to learn  And penetrate the bosom of a friend  Even with the wedge his uneasiness had furnish'd  Such men should not be trusted  ABDALLAH  True Velasco  But thou art not like them I have observ'd thee  Warm in affection but in temper cool  A steady judgment guides thee thro' the world  Thy gen'rous mind pursues the path of honour  Unbiass'd and unmov'd  VELASCO  From early youth  The chosen consident of my companions  I never yet from persidy betray'd  From babling vanity divulg'd a secret  ABDALLAH  I have a tale to tell that will amaze  Confound and strike thee dumb The deserts vast  Of Asia and of Africa have heard it  The rocky cliffs of Caucasus and Atlas  Have echo'd my complaints But never yet  The human ear receiv'd them Thou hast heard  Already more than ever mortal did  Thou know'st the princess  VELASCO  Ormisinda  ABDALLAH  Her  VELASCO  Not many of the court have been more honour'd  With opportunities to know her worth  And there is none who more her worth reveres  ABDALLAH  Her worth Thou may'st as well revere a fiend  The blackest fiend that dwells in burning hell  Is not more opposite to all that's good  Than Ormisinda  VELASCO  What a strain is this  ABDALLAH  'Tis true by every high and holy name  That binds a soldier's and a prince's vow  I swear Velasco she's the vilest woman  That e'er disgrac'd her sex The most abandon'd  The hardiest most determin'd in her vice  That ever wrong'd a fond believing heart  VELASCO  Great God  ABDALLAH  You start and shudder like a man  Struck with a heavy blow  VELASCO  And so I am  ABDALLAH  And now you lift your eyelids up and stare  With looks full of conjcture and suspicion  As if you doubted of my sober mind  I am not mad Velasco tho' sometimes  I have been near yes very near to madness  By that bad woman craz'd  VELASCO  O Would to heav'n  That this afflicting moment of my life  Were a delirious dream Unreal all  That's heard and spoken now But how my Lord  Art thou so much affected by her crimes  ABDALLAH  I am her husband  VELASCO  Heav'n for that be prais'd  ABDALLAH  How dar'st thou thus profane the name of heav'n  And mock my misery Thou art mad I think  The frenzy which thou wished'st has come upon thee  Beware for if this extasy endures  My sword secures thy silence  VELASCO  O forgive me  Noble Alonzo royal I should say  Doubly my master now There's not a man  Whose veins contain one drop of Spanish blood  Who does not wish thee wedded to the princess  And for her virtue Thou hast long been absent  Reserv'd retir'd and sad I'll stake my soul  Some villain has belied thy faithful wife  And snar'd thy easy faith  ABDALLAH  Take heed take heed  I am the villain who accuse the princess  And thou shalt be her judge  VELASCO  Eternal power  What should I think of this  ABDALLAH  Listen to me  I have perplex'd thee and have marr'd the story  By my abruptness 'Tis a serious story  Not to be told in parcels and by starts  As I from impotence of mind began  But I will bear my swelling passion down  And utter all my shame Thou dost remember  How I was banish'd from my native land  VELASCO  For killing young Ramirez  ABDALLAH  At that time  I doated on the princess She conjur'd me  With earnest pray'rs with deluges of tears  Not to resist her father nor advance  My better title to the crown of Spain  As I had once resolv'd My rage she sooth'd  Pride anger int'rest yielded all to love  With her I made a merit of obedience  And pleaded so effectually my cause  That she consented to a private marriage  Before I left the kingdon We were married  And met together four successive nights  In the sequestered cottage of the wood  Behind the palace garden O I thought  Myself the happiest and the most belov'd  Of all mankind She mock'd me all the while  Meant me the cover of her loose amours  A cloak to hide her shame O God O God  Did I deserve no better  VELASCO  Good my Lord  What circumstance to warrant such conclusion  What evidence  ABDALLAH  The evidence of sight  Mine eyes beheld I saw myself dishonour'd  VELASCO  Your eyes beheld  ABDALLAH  By Heav'n and Hellthey did  The night preceding the appointed day  Of my departure from the realm of Spain  I slew impatient to the place of meeting  Before the hour was come To wear away  The tedious time for ev'ry minute seem'd  An age to me I struck into the wood  And wander'd there still steering to the gate  By which she was to enter Tho' the trees  The moon full orb'd in all her glory shone  My am'rous mind a sportful purpose form'd  Unseen to watch the coming of my bride  And wantonly surprize her Near the gate  There stood an aged tree It was a beech  Which far and wide stretch'd forth its level arms  Low near the ground and form'd a gloomy shade  Behind its trunk I took my secret stand  The gate was full in view and the green path  On which it open'd There I stood awhile  And soon I heard the turning of the key  My heart beat thick with joyand forth she came  Not as I wish'd She had a minion with her  A handsome youth was tripping by her side  Girt with a sword and dress'd in gay attire  He seem'd to court her as they pass'd along  Coy but not angry for I heard her laugh  She flung away He follow'd soon o'erttok her  Embrac'd her  VELASCO  Ah The Princess Ormisinda  ABDALLAH  I drew my sword that I remember well  And then an interval like death ensued  When consciousness return'd I found myself  Stretch'd at my length upon the naked ground  Under the tree My sword lay by my side  The sudden shock the transport of my rage  And grief had stopt the current of my blood  And made a pause of life  VELASCO  Alas my Lord  'Twas piteous indeed What did'st thou do  When life and sense return'd  ABDALLAH  With life and sense  My rage return'd Stumbling with haste I ran  To sacrifice them to my just revenge  But whether they had heard my heavy fall  Or that my deathlike swoon had lasted long  I know not but I never saw them more  I search'd till morning then away I went  Resolv'd to scorn the strumpet and forget her  But I have not been able to forget  Nor to despise her tho' I hate her more  Than e'er I lov'd her still her image haunts me  Where'er I go I think of nothing else  When I'm awake and never shut my eyes  But she's the certain vision of my dream  Sometimes in all her loveliness she comes  Without her crimes In extasy I wake  And wish the vision had endur'd for ever  For these deceitful moments O my friend  Are the sole pleasant moments which Alonzo  For eighteen years has known  VELASCO  Within that time  What regions barbarous hast thou explor'd  What strange vicissitudes of life endur'd  In action and repose  ABDALLAH  Extremes of both  I courted to relieve my tortur'd mind  But the tormenter still my steps attends  Behind me mounts when thro' the ranks of war  I drive my fiery steed and when I seek  The hermit's cell the fiend pursues me there  Time which they say the wounds of passion cures  In other hearts inflames and festers mine  There's but one remedy  VELASCO  Would I could name one  ABDALLAH  Her life The unction for the serpent's bite  Is the fell serpent's blood I'll have her life  Th' adulteress with infamy shall die  By public justice doom'd With this intent  Disguis'd I come If in my proper shape  I had appear'd alarm'd she would have sled  And bafiled my revenge  VELASCO  My Lord pemit me  One thing to mention which these eyes beheld  Altho' it squares not just with thy opinion  ABDALLAH  Opinion  VELASCO  Good my Lord with patience hear  When first I was to this employment nam'd  Which since I have so happily discharg'd  The Princess sent and call'd me to her presence  The treaty with the Moor engross'd her thoughts  That sad and pensive air she always wears  Was settled to a thicker gloom of grief  Her voice was low and languid Few her words  And the short periods ended with a sigh  But when I gave her hopes of thy return  A sudden gleam of joy spread o'er her face  Like morning breaking in a cloudy sky  With earnest voice still rising as she spoke  She urg'd dispatch exhorted me to zeal  And perseverance Never to desist  Till I had found thee For her fate she said  The fate of Spain depended on Alonzo  Her passion then burst in a flood of tears  That choak'd her utterance  ABDALLAH  And thou didst believe  That ev'ry word she spoke was most sincere  How to interpret her let me instruct thee  Whate'er she utters with unusual warmth  As the effusion genuine of her heart  Receive and construe in another sense  Reverse and opposite for that's the truth  The words she spoke her sights the tears she shed  Were all from apprehension of my coming  Not as they seem'd for fear I should not come  VELASCO  'Tis dreadful that  ABDALLAH  'Tis horrible 'tis monstrous  When I for her had way'd my right to reign  The right undoubted of the Gothic line  And stoop'd enamour'd to that base decree  From Spain which banish'd the true heir of Spain  That she should pitch on me to be her fool  And pour such infinite contempt upon me  But four days married Fond to madness fond  And on the very eve of my departure  She would not for a single day refrain  But ruth'd to prostitution  VELASCO  I have heard  Stories and tales enough of female falshood  Some that were true and others that were feign'd  By spiteful wits maliciously devis'd  But this surpasses all  ABDALLAH  All wicked women  Compar'd with her are saints She is a foil  To set them off and make their foulness fair  In her incontinence she stands unrivall'd  Burning in fires peculiar to herself  Phoenix in lewdness  VELASCO  May I ask my Lord  How he intendsBut see the King draws near  ABDALLAH  He's much impair'd  VELASCO  When fore affliction comes  In the decline of life 'tis like a storm  Which in the rear of autumn shakes the tree  That frost had touch'd before and strips it bare  Of all its leaves  Enter the  KING  with attendants  As he advances speaks to  VELASCO  KING  We thank thy care Velasco  To  ABDALLAH  Illustrious Prince whom love of glory brings  From regions so remote to fight for Spain  Accept the thanks a grateful nation pays  To her defender  ABDALLAH  Monarchof Asturia  The nations of the East have heard thy praise  Had not the hand of Time unstrung thine arm  Spain never would have sought for foreign aid  To quell her foes  KING  'Tis better far for Spain  That I am old For in my warlike days  When in the prime of flow'ring youth I fought  I equall'd not thy friend Above his own  Above the strength of ev'ry mortal arm  Alonzo thine exalts  ABDALLAH  Three times we fought  With equal fortune on the Wolga's banks  He for the Monguls I against them stood  But at our last encounter on my helm  His faithless blade broke short and in his hand  The useless hilt remain'd My sword I dropt  And in my arms the valiant chief embrac'd  Our friendship thus commene'd and since that time  We have been brothers sworn and leagu'd in arms  Alonzo fighting in my cause receiv'd  That wound which now detains him from the field  Urg'd by affection and by honor bound  For him I come against the soes of Spain  But of myself more than enough is said  'Tis time to act The Moorish knight I hear  Is in the lists already  KING  Prince of Persia  The terms to thee are known  ABDALLAH  The first of men  With pride such honors might from Spain receive  But never can these honors grace Abdallah  Long since my heart and hand were giv'n away  And tho' the custom of the East permits  Unnumber'd consorts me my faith restrains  But if victorious in the strife of death  I have an earnest and a just request  To thee O King which at a proper time  I shall be bold to make  KING  Whate'er it is  I pledge my honor and my faith to grant it  Enter  SEBASTIAN  and  ALBERTO  ALBERTO  goes on to the  KING  KING  Advance Alberto to the Prince himself  Deliver thou thy message and the present  ALBERTO  Great Sir the Princess Ormisinda greets  The gen'rous champion of her country's cause  Wishes that victory may sit to day  And ev'ry day of battle on his sword  This costly bracelet from her arm she sends  To prince Abdallah to Alonzo's friend  ABDALLAH  Looking stedfastly on  ALBERTO  The Princess is most bountiful as thou  Who hast the honor to attend her know'st  Her gracious present humbly I accept  And thank her for her goodness to Alonzo  Who will be proud to be by her remember'd  The combat ended I propose to pay  My homage to her beauty At this time  My mind is in the listsThe Moorish knight  Will think me tardy    To the  KING  KING  Let our trumpets sound  A sprightly charge The warrior's heart beats time  To that brave music Onward from this place  A path direct to thy pavilion leads  The  KING  turns and gives orders  ABDALLAH  to  VELASCO  Another minion View him well Velasco  How insolent See what a crest he rears  Elated with her favour O vile woman  Insatiate and inconstant  VELASCO  Ah my Lord  Truce with such thoughts Sure this is not a time  The combat claims a cool and present mind  ABDALLAH  Fear not the combat  VELASCO  Thou art waited for  The King himself intends with thee to walk    Exeunt  Abdallah  looking back at  Alberto  Manent  ALBERTO SEBASTIAN  ALBERTO  That Prince of Persia is compos'd of pride  He did not deign to look upon the present  But stretch'd his sunburnt hand straight out before him  Like a blind man and would have stood so still  Had I not made his fingers feel the pearls  And all the while he star'd me in the face  As if he meant t'oppress me with his eye  And fright me with his fierce and uncouth looks  I blush'd at first but anger came at last  And bore me up  SEBASTIAN  Those princes of the East  Us'd to the servile manners of their country  Where ev'ry prostrate slave adores his lord  Without intention shock the sons of Europe  ALBERTO  O how unlike to him the King of Spain  And that most gentle Princess Ormisinda  Her look her voice benign and mild dispel  The awe her rank inspires and reassure  The modest mind Would'st thou believe Sebastian  She talk'd to me I cannot tell how long  Before thou cam'st and question'd me minutely  How I had liv'd how past my youthful days  I fear I was too copious in my answers  What signifies my rural life to her  And yet she seem'd to listen with delight  As if she had an int'rest in my fate  And once or twice when I of danger spoke  From which I hardly had escap'd with life  Methought I saw her tremble Much she blam'd  My rashness yet she prais'd my courage too  With all her tenderness of heart I see  That she admires true valour  SEBASTIAN  So she does  The bravest knight that e'er was clad in steel  Alonzo was the lover of her youth  And since he left this land she ne'er rejoic'd  But of these matters I will tell thee more  At a convenient season Let us follow  And join the train before they reach the lists  ALBERTO  I would not lose one moment of this sight  For half the lands of Spain Tho' I abhor  The Persian yet I pray devoutly for him  Exeunt  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  The City  Enter  ORMISINDA  and  TERESA  ORMISINDA  THIS city looks as if a pestilence  Had swept the whole inhabitants away  The solitary streets the empty squares  Appall me more than the deserted palace  Let us go back again  TERESA  'Tis time we should  You trembled at the howling of a dog  That broke the silence and increas'd the horror  If we stay here we shall be fancystruck  Mistake some statue for a palefac'd ghost  And think it beckons with its marble arm  ORMISINDA  Why should this desolation frighten me  Why should I fear to see a graveclad ghost  Who may so soon be number'd with the dead  And be myself a ghost What noise is that  Did'st thou not hear Teresa  TERESA  Yes I did  I heard an uncouth sound  ORMISINDA  Uncouth indeed  An universal groan Hark there again  TERESA  'Tis not the same This has another tone  A shout of triumph and a burst of joy  ORMISINDA  The combat's over and my fate's determin'd  Now death or life  The trumpets sound  TERESA  Long may the Princess live  And every hour be fortunate as this  The Spanish trumpets sound the sign I know  Thy champion has prevail'd  ORMISINDA  O gracious Heav'n  The lists are near and we shall quickly learn  TERESA  Look yonder flying swifter than the wind  A horseman comes now at the gate he lights  And hastes across the square It is Sebastian  His look his gesture speak his tidings good    Enter  SEBASTIAN  SEBASTIAN  Joy to the Princess Victory and peace  The Moor is slain by brave Abdallah's hand  ORMISINDA  Blest be thy tongue Sebastian Thou shalt find  Some better recompence than barren thanks  For these glad tidings But the gen'rous Prince  Who fought for Spain  SEBASTIAN  Safe and without a wound  Fresh for another foe Abdallah stands  Short was the combat Soon the boaster fell  Who durst defy the Christian world to arms  ORMISINDA  The God of battles whom Abdallah serves  Has overthrown the infidel whose trust  Was in his own right arm  SEBASTIAN  If I should live  Ten thousand years I never could forget  The solemn prelude and the fierce encounter  Thou know'st the place appointed for the combat  An amphitheatre by nature form'd  ORMISINDA  I know it well  SEBASTIAN  The hills of various slope  And shape which circle round the spacious plain  Were cover'd with a multitude immense  Of either sex of every age and rank  Christian and Moor whose faces and attire  Strangely diversified the living scene  Within the lists a gallery was rais'd  In which thy father and the Moorish prince  Sate with their peers the judges of the field  To them the knights with slow and stately pace  Approach'd and bound by sacred oaths declar'd  That they no charm nor incantation us'd  But trusted in their valour and their arms  With low obeisance then they both fell back  And first the Moor for he the challenge gave  March'd to the middle of the listed field  There seiz'd his ponderous mace beneath whose weight  The brawny bearer bow'd and round his head  Like a light foil he flourish'd it in air  On him with diff'rent thoughts the nations gaz'd  But suddenly a flash of light and flame  Struck ev'ry eye from brave Abdallah's shield  Cover'd till then 'Twas made of polish'd steel  Which shone like adamant and to a point  Rose in the centre stanting on each side  This shield the Persian Prince advancing bore  On his left arm outstretch'd and in his right  Thrown back a little gleam'd a pointed sword  Erect and high the bold Mirmallon stood  And sternly ey'd his nearapproaching oe  Then forward sprung and on the flaming shield  Discharg'd a mighty blow enough to crush  A wall or split a rock The Spaniards gave  A general groan  ORMISINDA  That was the dreadful sound  We heard Teresa  SEBASTIAN  Glancing from the shield  Aside the mace descended Then enrag'd  Once more the Moor his thund'ring weapon rear'd  In stept the Prince and raising high his shield  Midway he met the blow and with the strength  And vigour of his arm obliquely down  The pond'rous mace he drove Then quick as thought  His better hand and foot at once advancing  Plung'd in Mirmallon's throat his thirsty blade  The giant stagger'd for a little space  Then falling shook the earth The Christians rais'd  A shout that rent the air Away I came  Happy to be the bearer of such tidings  Trumpet  ORMISINDA  Behold they come in triumph from the field  O glorious man And yet forgive me Heav'n  I grudge the conquest to Alonzo's friend  And wish Alonzo in Abdallah's place  Enter the  KING ABDALLAH VELASCO ALBERTO  c  ABDALLAH  To Velasco    See where she stands O Heavens  VELASCO  My Lord Alonzo  Compose thy thoughts  ABDALLAH  Behold her how she looks  As if she knew no ill That harden'd heart  Against remorse and fear and shame is arm'd  But I shall wring it now  KING  Daughter draw near  This godlike Prince all recompence disclaims  Save thanks from Spain The pleasing task be thine  To greet the saviour of thy native land  And speak our gratitude  ORMISINDA  No words can speak  The gratitude I feel Believe it great  As my deliverance vast as my distress  Like sad Andromeda chain'd to the rock  I stood a living prey when this brave Prince  Came like another Perseus from the sky  And sav'd me from destruction I forget  Wrapt in myself the charge my father gave  To thank the saviour of my native land  Another voice shall give thee thanks for Spain  Alonzo's voice shall thank thee for his country  His friends his peoplesav'd  ABDALLAH  Ah If I hear  Aside  This syren longer she will charm my rage  But I remember where I heard her last  Princess of Spain I merit not thy praise  Sent by Alonzo to this land I came  What has been done for Him I have perform'd  Now of his promise I remind the King  To grant me one request  KING  Speak It is granted  ORMISINDA  If I conjecture right even that request  Will prove one favour more on Spain conferr'd  ABDALLAH  Perhaps it may  KING  Proceed illustrious Prince  And make me happy to fulfil thy wish  ABDALLAH  Not for myself I speak but for my friend  And in his name whose person I sustain  I ask for justice on a great offender  KING  Thou shalt have ample and immediate justice  Nor favour nor affinity shall skreen  The guilty person Prince why ar thou troubled  Thou shank'st from head to foot Thy quiv'ring lip  Is pale with passion On thy forehead stand  Big drops Almighty God What dreadsul birth  Do these strong pangs portend  ABDALLAH  The guilty person  Whom with a capital offence I charge  Stands by thy side  KING  My daughter  ABDALLAH  Yes thy daughter  'Tis her I mean the Princess Ormisinda  Here in the presence of the Peers of Spain  I charge her with a crime whose doom the laws  Of Spain have wrote in blood Adultery  I read astonishment in ev'ry face  Who would suspect that one so highly born  With ev'ry outward mark of virtue grac'd  Had giv'n her honour to a worthless wretch  And driv'n a noble husband to despair  KING  Am I awake Is this the light of day  Art thou O Prince with sudden frenzy seiz'd  Or is the madness mine Renown'd Abdallah  What answer can be made to such a charge  This strange demand of justice on my daughter  For an offence that she could not commit  My daughter ne'er was married  ABDALLAH  Ask her that  Hear if she will deny she has a husband  KING  My child thou art amaz'd  ORMISINDA  No not so much  As thou wilt be my father when thou hear'st  Thy daughter's tongue confess she has a husband  KING  Hast thou a husband God of heav'n and earth  Since thou hast thus dissembled with thy father  Perhaps thou hast deceiv'd thy husband too  Who is thy husband Speak  ORMISINDA  The Prince Alonzo  KING  And hast thou been so long in secret wedded  'Tis eighteen years since he departed hence  ORMISINDA  O I have reason to remember that  There is no calendar so just and true  As the sad mem'ry of a wife forsaken  The years the months the weeks the very days  Are reckon'd register'd recorded there  And of that period I could cite such times  So dolorous distressful melancholy  That the bare mention of them would excite  Amazement how I live to tell the tale  But I forget the present in the past  No wonder for this moment is the first  That opes the sluices of a heart o'ercharg'd  And bursting with a flood of grief conceal'd  But I must turn me to another theme  The earnest eyes of all are bent on me  Watching my looks and prying to discern  Symptoms of innocence or signs of guilt  Hear then the frank confession of my soul  I have transgress'd  KING  Stain of a noble race  Dost thou avow thy crime  ORMISINDA  Mistake me not  I have transgress'd my duty to my father  Without his knowledge and against his will  Mov'd by a tender lover's parting tears  I join'd myself in wedlock to Alonzo  My King my father pardon the offence  Which against thee I own I have committed  But may I ne'er of God or man be pardon'd  Nor friend nor father ever pity me  If I have swerv'd one step from virtue's path  Or broke the smallest parcel of that vow  Which binds a faithful wife O Prince of Persia  Thou art the est of friends and benefactors  Thou com'st to end my most distracting woes  And to dispel th' impenetrable cloud  That darken'd all my days Now I shall know  Why I have been abandon'd and forsaken  Why I have been detested and despis'd  As never woman was Proceed my Lord  And whilst thou keenly dost assail my life  And dearer far my honor and my fame  Secure in innocence I'll calmly hear  From thee I hope the end of all my cares  ABDALLAH  Even thus Alonzo told me she would speak  And thus proclaim her innocence  ORMISINDA  Did He  O would to Heav'n Alonzo heard me now  Fearless defend his honor and my own  My voice which once was music to his ear  Like David's harp which sooth'd the gloomy king  Would charm his malady would drive away  The evil spirit and call back again  The better genius of his early days  O thou that wert so good so great admir'd  Of all mankind my lov'd my lost Alonzo  For thee in this humiliating hour  More than myself I mourn  ABDALLAH  Half aside  Eternal Power  To whom the secrets of all hearts are known  Hear hear this woman and between us judge  'Tis not my business to contend with words  These are the conquering arms of womankind  A nobler course of trial lies before me  In a wrong'd husband's name I charge this lady  With infidelity and crave the doom  Of law upon her head If any knight  Spaniard or stranger dares assert her cause  Let him stand forth and take my gauntlet up  Which on the ground I throw my gage to prove  That she is false to honor and Alnzo  ORMISINDA  Before the gage of death is lifted up  Hear me one moment By Alonzo sent  Thou com'st instructed in Alonzo's wrongs  Let me conjure thee then by all that's dear  By all that's sacred to the great and brave  Thy mother's memory thy consort's fame  Not on a gen'ral charge obscure and vague  To which there is no answer but denial  To found the claim of combat Single out  What circumstance thou wilt of special note  Of such a kind as may be tried and known  For true or false Tell us at least his name  With whom Alonzo's wife her honor stain'd  And let us be confronted    Young  ALBERTO  steps forth  ALBERTO  Heaven forbid  That thou should'st be consronted with a villain  Princess of Spain Be sure some wretch there is  Some renegado false to God and man  Suborn'd and ready with a lying tongue  To second this brave Prince who wrongs thy fame  And wounds thy modest ear Too much by far  Already thou hast heard Pretended Prince  For there is nothing royal in thy soul  Thou base defamer of a lady's name  I take thy gauntlet up and hold it high  In scorn and fierce desiance to thy face  My gage to prove thy accusation false  And thee the author of a tale invented  To rob a noble lady of her fame  ORMISINDA  Where am I now What shall I do Teresa  Aside  TERESA  The God of Heav'n direct thee  ABDALLAH  Boy To thee  I answer nothing I suspect the cause  Of thy presumption and could wish that Spain  Had gi'n a worthier victim to my sword  Walks aside  ORMISINDA  O valiant youth much am I bound to thee  But I have reasons that import the state  Which shall whatever is my fate be known  And own'd hereafter to be great and weighty  Why I decline th' assistance of thy sword  If this appeal to combat is the law  And I can find no champion but Alberto  Without the chance of combat let me fall  For I will not accept  ALBERTO  Recall these words  Too gen'rous Princess I can read thy thoughts  Thou think'st my youth unequal to the foe  Thou fear'st the weakness of Alberto's arm  My strength exceeds the promise of my years  Oft have I bent the bow and drawn the sword  Nor fly my shafts nor falls my sword in vain  This day against a troop alone I fought  But never did I fight in such a cause  Nor was I e'er so certain to prevail  A fire divine invades my zealous breast  I feel the force of legions in mine arm  Thy innocence has made thy champion strong  The God of battles is our righteous judge  And let the cause be tried  A warrior armed with his helmet on steps forth  WARRIOR  But not by thee  Thy father's voice forbids too daring youth  Stand back and let thy master in the art  Of war now claim the combat for his own  My liege  KING  That voice I know Thy figure too  Resembles much a chief lamented long  As slain in battle  WARRIOR  I am he Costollo  'Tis true O king that on the field I fell  Fighting for Spain How I was sav'd from death  And where for many years I have remain'd  This is no time to tell This hour demands  A soldier's speech brief prologue to his deeds  On me proud Persion turn thy gloomy eyes  Hear me and let thy ready sword reply  With hellborn malice level'd at her life  Thou hast defam'd a Princess honour'd lov'd  By all who virtue or fair honour love  The fell Hyaena native of thy land  Has not a voice or heart more false than thine  Thou counterfeit of truth whom I defy  To mortal combat and the proof of arms  Thy fullblown fame thy unexhausted strength  Deceitful confidence I laugh to scorn  The conquering cause is mine  ALBERTO  My lord the King  And ye his counsellors for wisdom fam'd  You will not sure permit this good old man  By fond affection for his son impell'd  To meet so stern a foe His hoary head  His wither'd veins are symptoms of decay  Lean not upon a reed which time hath bruis'd  Nor trust the life and honour of the Princess  To the weak arm of age  ABDALLAH  I'll fight you both  Father and son at once Together come  Tonguevaliant men and try Abdallah's arm  I'll have it so for both of you have dar'd  Ignoble as you are to match yourselves  Against a Prince who moves not in your sphere  And utter words for which such blood as yours  Is poor atonement  COSTOLLO  Ev'ry word thou speak'st  Is insolent and false Son of a slave  For eastern monarchs buy with gold their brides  The blood by thee despis'd flows from a sourc  Purer than thine and nobler  ALBETO  Nay my father  That's said too far Fierce and disdainful Prince  Vain is the offer which thy passion makes  Perhaps the conqueror of the Moor may find  One Spaniard is enough  COSTOLLO  A father's right  Unmov'd I claim and with determin'd voice  Forbid the combat  KING  Hence let us retire  To the pavilion There our peers shall judge  Of your pretensions  Exeunt King and Spaniards  ABDALLAH  Come with me Velasco    Exeunt  Abdallah  and  Velasco    Manent  ORMISINDA  and  TERESA  ORMISINDA  My thoughts are of my son Mine own estate  Is desp'rate The husband whom I lov'd  On whom I doated and from whom I suffer'd  What never woman with such patience bore  Conspires against my honour and my life  Long cherish'd hope farewel  TERESA  To guard thy son  Defend thyself and to prevent the combat  In thy demand persist Call the accuser  To circumstance of proof That is the thread  To lead us thro' this labyrinth perplex'd  Nor has the Persian thy demand refus'd  ORMISINDA  He had not time to speak Alberto's voice  Broke in like thunder in his mother's cause  Amidst the anguish of my tortur'd heart  My soul exults Teresa in my son  When in the pride of valour forth he came  And for my sake defied the bold Abdallah  His look he seem'd a cherub in my eyes  His voice at every word my bosom yearn'd  Transported me so much that I forgot  His state and mine and had well nigh sprung forth  To clasp my blooming hero in my arms  TERESA  No wonder that his mother's soul was mov'd  His brave demeanor the spectators charm'd  Valour which sheds a glory round the head  Of age and ruggedness how bright its beams  When in the lovely front of youth they shine  ORMISINDA  I've heard of strange and perilous essays  To try the pureness of suspected virtue  I'll undergo whate'er can be devis'd  By ordeal trial let my faith be prov'd  Blindfold barefooted on the smoaking soil  With red hot ploughshares spread I'll walk my way  Plunge in the boiling oil my naked arm  But will not risk my young Alonzo's life  The Moorish host hangs o'er our heads no more  The heir of Spain shall for himself be known  Alonzo's son  TERESA  He will not be allow'd  Alonzo's son nor yet the heir of Spain  Whilst slander's breath sullies his mother's fame  ORMISINDA  Now thou hast touch'd a string to whose deep sound  A mother's heart replies My son my son  I weigh thy virtues down hang on thy life  Attaint thy blood thy birth thy right to reign  The birds of prey that dwell among the rocks  The savage beasts that thro' the deserts roam  The monsters of the deep their offspring love  And to preserve their lives devote their own  Athwart the gloom I see a flash of light  That opens the horizon I descry  A hand that points a high and lofty path  Which I will boldly tread Now to my father  Upon my knees his aid I'll first implore  Exeunt  END F THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  ABDALLAH  and  VELASCO  VELASCO  BEFORE this day she ne'er beheld the boy  Far from this place in Catalonia bred  He came to see the famous combat fought  'Twas he my Lord who slew the Moorish chief  And in his own defence such wonders wrought  That action to the Princess made him known  The rest in honour of his valour follow'd  ABDALLAH  How dost thou know  VELASCO  With admiration struck  When he stood forth and brav'd a foe like thee  Of divers persons curious I enquir'd  Who and from whence he was  ABDALLAH  Pity it were  To hurt the stripling 'Tis a noble boy  I love the outbreak of his Spanish fire  Against the Moors  VELASCO  Ay and against Abdallah  Whom antient fame and recent glory rais'd  Above all mortal men Spare this young plant  Who makes so fair a shoot  ABDALLAH  How can I spare him  Should their election send him to my sword  How good Velasco  VELASCO  When the peers return  The King the Princess with their champion chosen  Then to the wond'ring audience in the face  Of her that's guilty let my Lord relate  The truthmark'd story he to me has told  Detected thus confounded and surpris'd  Pierc'd with a thousand eyes that gaze upon her  And dart conviction can she still deny  And by denial make her guilt ambiguous  But if her sex's genius is so strong  That she the port of innocence maintains  And from the fulness and excess of vice  Derives a boldness that may look like virtue  Then let the sword decide  ABDALLAH  What you propose  Is worth the trial I am loth to spill  The young Alberto's or Costollo's blood  For they deserve no harm Ev'n you my friend  Before my hand unclasp'd the book of shame  Her champion would have been  VELASCO  Against the world  ABDALLAH  I will adopt the counsel of Velasco  And probe more deeply still her fester'd mind  I see 'tis better that she should confess  Her guilt than with her vanquish'd champion fall  By doom of law protesting to the last  Her innocence  VELASCO  Better a thousand times  Her dying voice would shake the hearts of men  And echo thro' the world  ABDALLAH  Behold the King  And young Alberto marching by his side  As if he trod on air  VELASCO  See Ormisinda  With folded hands implores her list'ning sire  Enter the  King Ormisinda Teresa Alberto Costollo  c  KING  The peers of Spain have judg'd Stand forth Alberto  Behold the champion of my daughter's fame  ALBERTO  Before the trumpet's voice unsheaths the sword  Which one of us shall never sheath again  Permit me Prince of Persia to intreat  A moment's audience Not from fear I speak  The cause I fight for and the mind I bear  Exalt me far above the thoughts of dnger  But from a conscious sense of what is due  To thee renown'd Abdallah In the heat  Of our contention if my tongue has utter'd  One word offensive to thy noble ear  Which might have been omitted and the tone  Of firm defiance equally preserv'd  For that I ask forgiveness  ABDALLAH  Less I mark'd  The manner than the matter of thy speeck  If thou dost need forgiveness freely take it  KING  'Twas generously ask'd and nobly granted  Such courtesy with valour ever dwells  Let me too crave for a few words thine ear  Throughout the trying bus'ness of this day  Thou art my witness that my mind upright  Has never been by pow'rful nature bent  Nor sway'd to favour and opinion form'd  By long habitual and accustom'd love  But I with equal hand the balance held  Between thee and my child  ABDALLAH  Thou hast indeed  It is but justice that I should declare it  KING  Then to thy candour let me now appeal  And beg of thee to grant me one request  Which I do not but might perhaps command  ABDALLAH  What is it  KING  I have search'd my hapless child  Ev'n to the pith and marrow of her soul  Have touch'd her to the quick She never shrinks  Nor wavers in the least Perhaps my Lord  Some fool officious or some wretch that's worse  If there is ought comes between man and wife  That's more pernicious than a medling fool  Some false designing friend has wrong'd her fame  And pour'd his poison in Alonzo's ear  If thou wilt give some scope to her defence  And bring the charge from darkness into light  Then she shall forthwith answer on the spot  Where now she stands before us  ORMISINDA  If I fail  To clear my fame ev'n in Abdallah's sight  If but one dark suspicious speck remains  To make mine honour dim let me be held  Guilty of all Beforehand I renounce  The right of combat and submit to die  ABDALLAH  Thy wish is fatal but if shall be granted  This instant too  ORMISINDA  Blessings upon thy head  Ten thousand blessings O thou dost not know  How happy thou hast made me On my breast  A mountain lay Thy hand has heav'd it off  And now I breathe again  ABDALLAH  O woman woman  A little way from hence my people wait  With them remains a necessary witness  Thither I go and quickly will return  To ring thy knell    Exit  Abdallah  ORMISINDA  The knell of all my woes  My heart knocks at my side as if 'twould burst  Itself a passage outwards Yet a while  Poor suss'ring heart and thou shalt beat no more  Shortly for what I am I shall be known  Then let my doom be squar'd to my desert  Without indulgence  KING  I can trust thee now  Thine eye secure beams innocence and honour  Thou art my daughter still  ALBERTO  I fear O King  Some practice vile some infamous imposture  Supported by false witness Still I wish  The fair decision of the honest sword  Enter  ABDALLAH  in a Spanish Drss as  ALONZO  KING  God of my soul What mockery is this  Unless my eyes deceive me 'tis Alonzo  ORMISINDA  My husband Ah  Runs to embrace him he repulses her  ALONZO  Away thy husband's shame  Shame to thy sex reproach of womankind  ORMISINDA  O shield me Heav'n Abdallah was Alonzo  ALONZO  To Heav'n appeal not  ORMISINDA  I appeal to Heav'n  Justice on earth will come too late for me  KING  To Alonzo    Hast thou no other witness than thyself  ALONZO  I have no other and none else require  KING  Unfeeling man to trifle with our sorrows  And like a pageant play a mimic scene  This is thy hatred of Pelagio's house  Thy passion to confound a rival race  Would I were young again  ALBERTO  To  Alonzo  Defend thyself  I can no longer hold me from thy breast  PELAGIO  Sound trumpet sound and Heav'n defend the right  ALONZO  Drawing his Swords    His blood be on your heads  Ormisinda  throws herself between their Swords    ORMISINDA  Hold Strike thro' me  You know not what you do unhappy both  This combat must not nor it shall not be  The Sun in Heav'nwould backward turn his course  And shrink from such a spectacle as this  More horrid than the banquet of Thyestes  You have no quarrel I'll remove the cause  A Roman matron to redeem her fame  Before her husband's and her father's eyes  Plung'd in her breast the steel  Stabs herself and falls  KING  O Desp'rate deed  What fury urg'd thy hand  ORMISINDA  Condemn me not  There was no other way to savebut that  Must not as yet be told My husband hear  My dying voice my latest words believe  Whose truth my blood hath seal'd I'm innocent  As I for mercy hope at that tribunal  Where I shall soon appear I never wrong'd thee  When that is manifest remember me  As love like mine deserv'd and to this youth  Who is  ALONZO  Who is this youth Allseeing God  A secret horror comes upon my soul  Who is this youth  ORMISINDA  He is thy son  ALONZO  My son  ORMISINDA  Whom thy forsaken wife in sorrow bore  And gave in secret to Costollo's care  ALBERTO  Art thou my mother Dost thou die for me  ORMISINDA  I die with pleasure to be just to thee  O if that Power which did inspire my soul  To rush between your swords would let me live  To prove my innocence Alonzo speak  Whilst I have breath to answer  ALONZO  Tho' disarm'd  And soften'd even if guilty to forgive thee  Thy solemn call I instantly obey  That night appointed for our last farewel  That fatal night for ever curstthou know'st  What happen'd then  ORMISINDA  I know thou didst not come  Forlorn thou lefted'st me  ALONZO  Thou wast not forlorn  In the dark wood with thee there was a youth  ORMISINDA  After a pause  O heaven and earth a youth It was Teresa  ALONZO  Teresa  TERESA  Yes that memorable night  My brother's sword and helmet plum'd I wore  ALONZO  Great God the snares of hell have caught my soul  TERESA  The night before the Princess as she went  Was fright'ned in the wood and I assumed  That warlike form to seem  ALONZO  No matter why  I saw thee then and thought thee what thou seem'dst  KING  She's innocent like gold try'd in the fire  Her honour shines Would I had died for thee    To  ORMISINDA  ORMISINDA  Why didst thou never till this moment speak    To  ALONZO  ALONZO  Because I'm born and destin'd to perdition  Had I a voice like AEtna when it roars  For in my breast is pent as hot a fire  I'd speak in flames  ORMISINDA  My Lord  ALONZO  Do not forgive me  Do not oppress me with such tender looks  I will not be forgiven  ORMISINDA  raising herself and stretching out her arms  ORMISINDA  Come to my arms  And let me sooth thine anguish Had I been  What I to thee appear'd thy rage was just  A Spaniard's temper and a Prince's pride  A Lover's passion and a Husband's honour  Prompted no less  ALONZO  Hear men and angels hear  Let me fall down and worship  Throws himself into her arms  Oh I loved thee  I lov'd thee all the while to madness loved  ORMISINDA  My husband dear as ever to my heart  In my last moments dear  ALONZO  My heart is torn  My head my brain How blest I might have been  With such a wife with such a son  ORMISINDA  To him  Pay all the debt of love thou ow'st to me  Embrace thy son before mine eyes are clos'd  Let me behold him in his father's arms  ALONZO  Thou brave defender of thy mother's fame  ORMISINDA  He's gentle too his soul dissolves in grief  ALONZO  My falt'ring tongue dares scarcely call thee son  Canst thou endure the touch of such a father  ALBERTO  My bursting heart amidst its grief is proud  Of such a father Let me clasp thy knees  And help to reconcile thee to thyself  They embrace  ORMISINDA  This pleasing sight subdues the pains of death  My son  ALBERTO  My mother Oh  ORMISINDA  My dearest husband  ALONZO  What would'st thou say Alas thine eye grows dim  Thy voice begins to fail  ORMISINDA  Remember me  When I am dead remember how I lov'd you  And thou Alnzo live to guard thy son  To fix the Spanish scepter in    Dies looking at her son  Alonzo  remains silent with his eyes fixed upon  Ormisinda  ALBERTO  My father  Under thy gather'd brows I see despair  Have pity on thy son who liv'd so long  In total ignorance of what he was  Who has already seen one parent die  And for the sad survivor trembles now  My mother's last request  ALONZO  I'm mindful of it  And to her sacred memory will be just  Hang not on me my son go to the King  And pay thy duty there    The King embraces  Alberto  KING  My child my all  I lov'd thee at first sight  ALONZO  'Tis well 'tis well  The good old King hath still some comfort left  Now is my time  Draws his sword  Oft have I struck with thee  But never struck a foe with better will  Than now myself  Stabs himself and falls  VELASCO COSTOLLO  Alas  ALBERTO  turning    ALBERTO  'Twas this I fear'd  ALONZO  There was good cause to fear I would have liv'd  For thee if I with honour could have liv'd  My son thy fathers were renown'd in arms  The valour of our warlike race is thine  But guard against the impulse of their blood  Take warning by my fate  PELAGIO  Thou might'st have liv'd  Renown'd Alonzo even I forgave  And pitied thee  ALONZO  I am more just than thou  For I did not forgive nor would I live  Upon the alms of other men their pity  Farewel my son O Ormisinda stay  'Till I o'ertake thee  Dies    The King to  ALBERTO  PELAGIO  Dwell not on this sight  Prince of Asturia leave the scene of sorrow  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs BARRY  THO' lately dead a Princess and of Spain  I am no Ghost but Flesh and
