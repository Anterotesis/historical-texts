 THE CONFESSIONS OF  JAMES BAPTISTE COUTEAU  CITIZEN OF FRANCE  VOL I  James Baptiste Couteau  THE CONFESSIONS OF  JAMES BAPTISTE COUTEAU  CITIZEN OF FRANCE  WRITTEN BY HIMSELF  AND TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL FRENCH  By ROBERT JEPHSON Esq  ILLUSTRATED WITH NINE ENGRAVINGS  Usque adeo permiscuit imis  Longus summa dies  LUCAN  Falso Libertatis vocabulum obtendi ab iis qui privatim degeneres in publicum exitiosi nihil spei nisi per discord  habeant  TAC AN L X    IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT PICCADILLY  PREFACE  RIDICULE we know has been too often applied with success to the perversion of serious things and to the profanation of sacred when it can be used with effect to render vice and depravity more detestable it may be then considered as wearing its very best form Many who are too volatile to attend to the  force of a grave argument or to feel the weight of serious deductions are not incapable of relishing a jest and it amounts to the same thing in the end whether men are reasoned or laughed into philanthropy  So many grave volumes have appeared upon the enormities of FRANCE since the frenzy of Revolutions and Reformation seized upon that unhappy Country that another sober dissertation would  perhaps rather add one more to the number of publications than contribute any efficacy to a Writer's good intentions At this time it seems hardly necessary to admonish thinking men against espousing visionary theories of political perfection in States the deplorable picture of FRANCE speaks more eloquently than  the sweet tongues of twenty orators  Of all mankind the subjects of these happy Islands stand least in need of such admonitions yet are  there to be found among us some spirits malevolent enough to cry out with MIITON'S LUCIFER in Paradise  Sight hateful fight tormenting  and who still manifest a lurking partiality for the glorious anarchy of our GALLIC Neighbours  COULD we suppose the Spirit of Evil had been permitted to produce the people of one particular nation I think we should expect them to act exactly as the FRENCH have done  with this difference only that there would probably be a little more sense and consistency in their wickedness They would commit the same crimes call them by the same names varnish them over with the same pretences and be led by the same kind of champions They would have their DANTON their SANSTERRE their MARAT their ROBESPIERRE their GORSAS and their EGALITE We should not be surprised to hear they had erected temples and established public worship  to the Prince of Darkness and that the Devil was adored among them not as by the INDIANS through fear but from veneration  IN the following pages the Reader will see the detail of much wickedness and no exaggeration the Author's difficulty was to invent up to the real atrocities of the Nation from which he has selected his principal characters  CONTENTS  CHAP I  MY Parentage and Person  CHAP II  I am taken as a

always been a great admirer of the samous JOHN JAMES ROUSSEAU I decorate my work with the same title which he chose for a posthumous publication  Though my name has not yet acquired equal celebrity with his in the Republic of Letters I flatter myself however that my actions surpass his as much at least as he is superior to me in genius and eloquence  AFTER all what had ROUSSEAU to confess Wretched trifles The stealing a ribbon ruining the honest character of a poor servantmaid deserting a friend in his distress and having desiled the iron pot where Madam CLOT's dinner was boiling and a few other peccadilloes which tend rather to prove the baseness than the elevation of his mind However it must be acknowledged that he was  a very great man He doubted of the existence of the Deity and with his usual ingenuity of scepticism has raised such a mist about his notions of the Christian persuasion that he has left the world in complete indecision whether he was a believer or an infidel None of his actions it is true are attended with any splendor but to such principles as he and his associates in the same cause have disseminated FRANCE is obliged for that glorious anarchy which prevails there at present and which probably will continue to prevail there to the last hour of her duration  I DO not retrace my adventures in order to caution others against falling  into the snares which are laid for innocence and simplicity but to prove that in the present age the way to honours and selicity is open to all persons who have spirit and who by the mere force of genius will venture to emancipate themselves from vulgar prejudices besides I feel no small satisfaction in considering that my reputation and my merit will go hand in hand and with anequal pace through the world together  I WAS born at PARIS in the street  St Marcel  My mother was a Fishwoman ugly poor and disgusting but of a robust make and well formed by nature to offer and to endure every sort of violence My supposed father  was a Butcher and I go by the same Christian names though perhaps without the formality of any baptism But to say truth I have some doubts as to my filiation on the paternal side for my mother's accounts were never as to that point entirely consistent She imputed me at different times to almost every person in the neighbourhood Sometimes she said I was her son by a Shoecleaner sometimes by a Cobler in the Marsh sometimes by one and sometimes by another just as it happened to serve her turn to get a little money for her present necessities by the recollection of the tender intimacy and connection which had subsisted between her and the uncertain author of my existence  HAD it pleased Nature to have endowed me with great talents for Poetry as many fathers might have disputed a right to my procreation as there were Cities of GREECE which contended for the birth of HOMER but Fortune formed me rather to perform great exploits than to sing them and I can hardly expect that the simple narrative following will ever be placed under the protection of an APOLLO PALATINUS  WITH respect to my Figure I can give the Reader no idea more exact in general than by assuring him that as to it I am principally indebted for my present elevated station in life it is such as never fails to raise some emotion of  terror in every person who happens to meet me I am tall like my mother my body remarkably strong and the cordage of my muscles such as artists never fail to give to the Statue of HERCULES My countenance is very striking for besides a violent squint my complexion is of a dingy olive my nose like a Negro's my teeth few in number very long and black red eyebrows a wide mouth and a chin sharp and peaked almost to a point at the extremity add to this an abundance of rich purple carbuncles strewed over my visage with the mark of several deep scars all conspicuous and this assemblage gives you precisely my picture  MY disposition accords perfectly with my outside and a Physiognomist much inferior in penetration to LAVATER would not hesitate at the first glance to pronounce upon the qualities of my mind By the fervour of my constitution being extremely susceptible of impressions from Women I sought to be connected with them from necessity and not from that sort of tender sympathy about which one hears so much and of which I never could entertain the most remote conception My blood always impelled me not my heart when the warmth of the flame was cooled by possession I generally considered the object with indifferenceoften indeed with disgust pleasures which are equally  shared between the sexes always leave the parties engaged in them upon an equal footing I never remember to have had an intimacy with any pretty woman who appeared to me to be such after my desires were satisfied except one beautiful peasant girl of LANGUEDOC She turned a deaf ear to my amorous proposals and I found it necessary to force her Necessity justifies every thing I was rough ferocious vindictive little sensible of kindness and obligations but always retaining the most precise recollection of and the most lively resentment for the slightest injury  I MUST here once for all apprize the reader that though he may meet  with many terms in this book which are used according to their ancient acceptation he must not therefore conclude that I understand them in that sense For instance when I speak of Cruelty I mean rather Firmness of Mind when I call Robbery and Massacre Crimes I consider them as proofs of the most exalted and heroic Virtue But the Revolution of Words being not yet so general in FRANCE as the Revolution of Principles to avoid perplexing the Public I sometimes adhere to the old corrupt modes of expression When our new Philosophy is completely established it will be followed by a Vocabulary as new till then I am afraid Language must in some degree conform to the  old corruption GALILEO was imprisoned for asserting that the Earth moved round the Sun yet the system of COPERNICUS is the only rational one and as such is now universally acknowledged  CHAP II  AM TAKEN AS A LACQUEY INTO A CONVENTDISMISSED FROM THENCE BUT FIRST LEARN TO READ AND WRITEABRIDGMENT OF ROMAN HISTORYEULOGY OF THE PRESS  MY childhood passed like that of most young folks of my condition When I wanted any thing I stole it when I was chastised I cried and whenever I had an opportunity I took vengenace for it to the utmost of my power At the age of fourteen  having been kicked out from the habitation of one of my possible fathers into the street a Monk happening to pass by looked steadily at me and took me with him to the Convent of which he was Providore There I soon learned to respect the Church and to make a jest of Religion  ONE would have thought my stomach had been an abyss and that I had birdlime at the ends of my singers I swallowed down all sorts of victuals and secreted for my own use every thing I could lay my hands on My thests were so frequent and managed with so little circumspection that my master at last surprised me in the fact He gently pushed me by the  shoulder out of the Convent predicting with a degree of confidence that my future abode would be in the Galleys Although I never imagined him to be gifted with the prophetic inspiration of ISAIAH his prediction however was accomplished  HE was too good a Christian to dismiss me from his service without offering me at the same time some wholesome advice for the regulation of my conduct which had I obsrved it might perhaps have prevented the completion of his prophecy During the exhortation I stole his snuffbox and handkerchief thinking it right to have some tokens like pious relics about me of a man so holy  During the Exhortation I stole his Snuffbox and handkerchief  VolI pa  DURING my sojourn at the Convent I learned to read and write knowing well that without these two advantages it is impossible with the happiest disposition from nature to be a rogue more than by halves Without acquaintance with great examples the most fertile genius is circumscribed Nourished only by itself it becomes sterile and like a field without manure in a short time produces nothing What arms are to the Soldier or instruments to the Surgeon Books are in the hands of the skilful  THE good Fathers who remarked with satisfaction my appetite for literature were eager who should be first  to supply me from their collections but their meagre shelves containing nothing better than stories of miracles the Lives of Saints and Martyrs and some receipts for making ragouts I borrowed books of a better stile in other places or I stole them  THE Abridgment of the ROMAN History pleased me greatly I was much struck with ROMULUS deceiving his Brother by a false augury and thus dexterously getting sole possession of the kingdom for knavery in things sacred suits my fancy wonderfully but I admired him still more when I read of his knocking out this same Brother's brains for his having in a frolic leaped over the little walls of his  newtraced city The Rape of the SABINE Women was to me a ravishing subject The ambition of TARQUIN the Proud the SoninLaw of SERVIUS who procured the assassination of his King and FatherinLaw his Consort TULLIA trampling upon the bleeding body of her dead Sire the incontinence of TARQUIN's Son SEXTUS and the violent death of the chaste LUCRETIA came up in some degree to my ideas of human licentiousness The first Consul BRUTUS who without listening to the voice of Nature ordered his Sons' heads to be struck off in his presence for treason appeared to me to be truly a great man But above all the proscriptions and cruelties of MARIUS and SYLLA transported  me beyond all bounds of moderation ROME deluged in her own blood the Magistrates the most respectable Citizens Priests Women and Children proscribed butchered and their mangled carcases piled up in heaps together presented to my mind's eye a most seducing picture In the perusal I contemplated it with that soft contentment that interior satisfaction which resulted I doubt not from a  presentiment  of that enchanting scene which is now so admirably realized in every spot and quarter of my own dearlybeloved country  THE history of MARK ANTONY no less sanguinary than he was amorous  always fixed my attention That celebrated Libertine with the amiable AUGUSTUS and their booby fellow Triumvir LEPIDUS proscribing three hundred Senators and above two thousand ROMAN Knights at one sitting then getting drunk and singing obscene ballads together in a little Island near MUTINA FULVIA the wife of ANTONY dragging with her own fair fingers the tongue from the jaws of dead CICERO and piercing it three times with her bodkin the head of that great Orator afterwards sperbly impaled upon a spike over the Rostrum and many other incidents at that period filled me with sensations too delightful for me to attempt their expression  BUT my hero was CATILINE A parricide sacrilegious a ravisher adulterer a cannibal a pandar and a reformer all together how ca language surnish terms to praise him sufficiently  As to the Emperors four or five of them excepted they were a series of desperadoes whose exploits might make all the Divinities of Hell blush in the comparison  IN every History which I perused I found something constantly to form the mind and improve the understanding That of GREECE particularly in which the most illustrious Patriots and Generals were always  exposed to the fury and caprice of the Rabble who without the least consideration for their services or their merit condemned them at once to ignominy or death awakened in my breast the most flattering expectation of soon seeing in that Nation which calls herself the most polite in EUROPE the renovation of similar disorders and universal confusion of all things  MY enquiries were not consined to the mere study of History I devoured all the prohibited books sold clandestinely by the Hawkers especially when I could find that they contained scandalous anecdotes either of gallantry or of the Clergy and when people of  condition and character were well mauled in them By degrees I became a Critic at last an Author At our nightly Club of tatterdemalions I pronounced emphatically upon the merit of every fugitive sheet which made its appearance for a day generally indeed without having read a word of it but I knew the Scribbler and my decisions were always considered as infallible Without vanity I may venture to affirm that no Libeller in FRANCE has ever with impunity so deeply injured the fair fame of his neighbours as I have done  For ever honoured be the Art of PRINTING In ENGLAND they boast of the Liberty of their Press with us  FRENCHMEN it is not the Liberty it is the Licentiousness which is admirable Oral Calumny is tardy feeble and circumscribed but give her paper wings and like a bird she cleaves the clouds and flies from province to province from kingdom to kingdom gives free circulation to imposition and a solitary pamphlet as the Poet POPE says of a loveletter  Can waft a  lie  from INDUS to the POLE  Lame Truth limps after too tardily to prevent the winged progress of her adversary Our Legislators who ostentatiously boast of our perfect Liberty in FRANCE and declaim with so much complacency in their own  praise for the emancipation of the Press sensible of the importance of the engine instantly destroyed every one in the kingdom except their own and imprisoned the Writers even of a single sheet who presumed to publish it without their permission The inhabitants principally such as could not read seeing them pass by loaded with irons clapped their hands and cried with a loud voice  Good Heaven what a satisfaction how charming how delightful to have a free Press  O DIVINE Art Womb of Science Daughter of Truth Consolation of the Unlearned Protectress of Rights true universal CzarinaOur arms  our cannon pikes poniards assassins and decrees have not contributed half so much as thou hast done to the blessed effects visible every where in the happy desolation of our delightful country By thy aid we have deposed and beheaded the very best of all our Kings manacled the Royal Family calumniated our Queen who expects every hour to be doomed to the gallows by thee our gallant villains possess all things and the lawful owners are without food or raiment What gunpowder is to the musket aimed against the human body thou canst effect when thy thunder is pointed against human reputation I cannot better conclude my eulogy upon the latter than by applying to it the  lines of the poet ARIOSTO when he describes the former  vien con suon la palla esclusa  Che si può dir che tuona et che balena  Nè men che soglia il fulmine ove passa  Ciò che tocca arde abbatte et fracassa  CHAP III  I BECOME BAWLER TO A PUPPETSHOW ACCOUNT OF MY INGENUITIES COMMITTED TO PRISON GET ACQUAINTED THERE WITH MARAT AND ROBESPIERRECHARACTERS OF THESE TWO GREAT MEN  THE courteous reader I flatter myself will easily pardon the few apostrophes in the preceding chapter He who can speak of Liberty without enthusiasm is but half a FRENCHMAN To return to my adventures  PENNYLESS sorrowful and retaining nothing of the Church but her nasal drone and her hypocrisy I wandered about for some time without knowing whither when the Manager of a Puppetshow ordered me to follow him Being arrived at the  Boulevards  we stopped at the entrance of an alley there he bade me stand still while he disappeared and in a few moments returned again with a Bear's skin in his arms After throwing it over my shoulders and fastening it well with a cord about my neck "Your business" says he  is to roar out to all the passersby to come in to the Puppetshow the most beautiful superb and august that was ever exhibited but above  I bellowed with such amazing vociferation that the Manager was obliged to save the drums of his ears by putting up his hands to the side of his head▪  VolI pa  all Rascal be sure to bawl loud enough to make them hear you  BEFORE he could well turn his back I began to exercise my Stentorial functions and I continued to bellow with such amazing vociferation that the Manager though accustomed to the most rude and dissonant noises was obliged to save the drums of his ears by putting up his hands to the sides of his head and burying his sconce in his miserable Theatre As he was retreating he could not forbear to shake his noddle and look back at me with a sort of malignant grin on his countenance which marked very strongly both his surprise and his satisfaction  BEHOLD me now gentle Reader covered with a bearskin Bawler to a Puppetshow and deafening the whole neighbourhood Although our Manager paid me handsomely enough out of the scanty profits of his Theatre I resolved to indemnify myself for the consumption of my lungs by resources more ample than the slender fund of my lawful wages The strength of my voice was well seconded by the agility of my hands As the entrance to the alley where our diminutive Theatre stood was so narrow that not more than three or four spectators could pass at a time without justling I remarked the circumstance and determined to turn it to my advantage I ransacked the pockets of the gentry  thus huddled together and eased them of their contents in the twinkling of an eye never forgetting however to cry out  Ladies and Gentlemen take care of your pockets  but not till after I had left them nothing to take care of  AT different times I left my station at the door and went into the House to divert myself with examining the contortions and tristiful visages of the good folks I had plundered In vain did our performers our wooden drolls exert their talents to divert them they appeared as insensible to the facetiousness of our Actors as our Actors themselves No power of Comedy was  sufficient to banish from their minds the bitter recollection of their losses  BY their air of satisfaction I could easily distinguish those who had not yet been under my hands and being always a friend to EQUALITY I determined to rifle them in going out as I had pillaged the other in coming in and thus to leave both parties equal Handkerchiess purses cases snuffboxes every thing of the kind had irresistible attractions for me Watchchains wantoning from the fobs of  petïtmáietres  or the girdles of the ladies never glittered before me in vain I gently drew out their appendages of pinchbeck silver and sometimes of  gold as one draws a bucket out of a well and all my goods lay snug under the bearskin There was no person in PARIS who knew so well perhaps as myself what o'clock it was nor deserved perhaps a halter so well for the accuracy of his knowledge In that immense capital I believe I was almost the only person who could not tell the hour of the day innocently  AMONG the multiplicity of my thefts the three following are sufficiently singular to excuse the recital and claim the reader's attention  FROM the lowest depth of the pocket of one of the most austere Prudes in the city I drew out a volume  of OVID very magnificently bound and adorned with plates as lascivious as the wanton imagination of the Poet and tool of the Engraver could fancy or execute There was no mystery in the display every thing was exposed and in a sair state of nature  A YOUNG  Devoté  pale and peevish concealed under the most decrous dress a large bottle of excellent Coniac brandy I laid my hands on it and in one draught quaffed it off to the health of its sallow proprietor  IN the pocket of a General Officer decorated with the cross of St LOUIS I met neither pistol nor bayonet but instead of them two small boxes set  with diamonds one a patchbox the other full of lipsalve He had however a very martial air his sword was of an immeasurable length his hat cocked in a most unrelenting manner and on his manslaughtering visage "No quarter" traced in visible characters Though he had served but two or three very inactive campaigus he abounded in recitals of sieges and battles His military atchievements recounted by himself surpassed by far those of the great FREDERIC of PRUSSIA or of any other modern hero who if possible offered more sacrifices than that monarch to the Goddess of Funerals  WHEN he raised the trumpet of BELLONA to his mouth he appeared to be possessed with a real Daemon He imitated so faithfully the controtions and groans of the wounded and the dying the thundering of cannon the bursting of bombs and all the insernal harmony of a field of battle that if it required spirit to be present at the scene of action no small degree of courage was also necessary to fortify the hearer not to shrink at the recital The small articles of his little portative toilette evidently proved that he culled roses and myrtles to deck the bower of amorous gallantry with no less care than he gathered laurels for the field of more hardy encounters  IT happened one day most unfortunately that while I was disposing of some of my booty to an honest receiver of stolen goods the owner came into the very place before the bargain was concluded He was no doubt somewhat surprised at this confusion of  meum  and  tuum  and to see his property thus unaccountably passing into the hands of a third person who had no more right to make the purchase than I had to offer it He slipped out without uttering a single word and in a few moments returned with two sturdy constables who after emptying my pockets compleatly dragged me away to the  Salpétriere  and left me there upon the straw in a dungeon  THERE I first became acquainted with MARAT and ROBESPIERRE two illustrious personages whose renown great as it is bears however no proportion to their exalted merit The former had been committed for offences without number the latter for having substituted his own name instead of that of the intended legatee in a last will which the testator his friend and benefactor had on his deathbed entrusted to his honesty  THEY appeared to be there entirely at their ease and as familiar with the inside of the  Salpétriere  as the Turnkey himself They knew all the regulations and vices of that insernal abode as well as if it had been the place of  Robespierre Marat Couteau  VolI pa  their birth and education and after a few conversations I found them equally well acquainted with the constitution of almost every other gaol in FRANCE Like the Underactors of the DUBLIN Theatre at least half of their time was passed in prison  ROBESPIERRE nephew of the great DAMIEN who in was broke on the wheel torn with pincers tortured dragged in pieces and half burned alive to the infinite entertainment of our FRENCH ladies was a native of FRANCE and went from thence to DUBLIN where he served as Sweeper to a shop in a street called  Pill Lane  After many pranks and misadventures in that city he sailed  back again to FRANCE in the hold of a merchant ship and became a sort of understrapper to the law or what the ENGLISH call a  Pettyfogger  at PARIS He is unquestionably a most respectable character endowed with the greatest versatility of genius and possessed of talents and spirit enough to animate a whole legion of Devils  THE origin of MARAT was not more illustrious than that of his fellowprisoner He had been a Hawker of prohibited Books and had experienced all the indignities incident to that perilous occupation Their manners were as unlike as their dispositions were similar MARAT cursed and swore at every sentence he uttered and vouched  to the truth of the most extravagant falshoods by the most tremendous execrations ROBESPIERRE is master of the most lying insinuation his tone of voice is gentle his words all weighed and his whole deportment imposing The simplest asseverations serve as guarantees to his want of veracity such as  You may rely upon what I tell you    By my Honour    Upon the word of a Gentleman  and such like  IT is impossible to determine which of the two is most impious or the greatestliar They seem to be equally rapacious and cruel and enlightened by the most confirmed Atheism  in one word they are both exactly such men as weak Christian morality would not fail to distinguish by the appellation of two consummate villains  CHAP IV  MORAL REFLECTIONSDISCOURSE OF ROBESPIERREBIRTH OF THE DAUPHINAN ANECDOTE  SEVERAL ancient and modern writers display before us many musty reflections which they illustrate with suitable examples to prove that mankind seldom know how to frame sensible petitions to the Supreme Disposer of all things that they foolishly request what if granted would  injure them and wish to avoid what would terminate in their felicity  Pauci dignoscere possunt Vera bona atque illis multum diversa  HUMAN creatures equally shortsighted in their desires and their apprehensions would do wisely to leave events to the disposal of Fortune that arbitress arranges things better than we can do and conducts them by herself without our interference to their most desirable conclusion My adventures ought to give some weight to this maxim  INTERCEPTED as I was in the very middle of my pocketpicking career and plunged down to the bottom of a  dungeon a hundred times I cursed the inconstancy of Fortune who had thus betrayed me and had not the love of life by an instinctive impulse restrained my arm my rage had put an end to my days on the spot and I had sunk into annihilation perhaps without ever having known more of MARAT and the worthy Nephew of DAMIEN than the mere celebrity of their characters But the Goddess of ANTIUM more propitious than my despair by arresting my rash hand reserved me to be not only their intimate friend but even their rival and to walk hand in hand and by the same road with them to the great work of reforming my beloved country Yes let me proclaim itUnder  the weight of irons and in the darkness of a dungeon was the FRENCH Triumvirate formed that Triumvirate which the Shades of MARIUS of SYLLA and of CINNA may contemplate from the sombrous caverns of PLUTO with admiration nay perhaps even with envy  IT happened one evening that MARAT drunk as a swine and all besmeared with tobacco in order to snore himself sober had staggered to the trucklebed of the Turnkey's daughter a blackeyed buxom wench who had taken a fancy to him and the Nephew of DAMIEN and myself being thus left together that great man addressed me in the following manner  "FRIEND COUTEAU" says he  if you knew me well you would do me the justice to believe that I am not a kind of person to make much parade of my good dispositions towards my acquaintance I leave them to discover it by proofs and not by professions but I know not how it is there is something amiable in your aspect and a sublimity in your sentiments which I find to be in unison with my own feelings Every man the wisest of us is liable to mistakes yet I do venture boldly to predict that unless some unlucky accident happens to cut short the thread of your days you will mount on Fortune's ladder much higher than your contemporaries  In your prosperous ascension I offer myself to be your MENTOR and without the most distant motive of interest for the happiest natural dispositions without the assistance of sound precepts are but like ships without sails which can never arrive at the port they desire or like birds without wings which may at best hop alittle from the ground but can never cleave the sky like hawks and eagles Our antimoralists like their adversaries overcharge their instructions There are always shades of vice as of virtue which a master cannot discriminate with precision enough to place them exactly before  the eyes of the disciple In such cases the penetration of the pupil must rely upon itself The sagacity of the great ENGLISH Philosopher NEWTON who could analyse or dissect a ray of light would have been baffled had he attempted it MY aim is to deceive the rest of the world and never to be the dupe myself to accomplish this my rules are simple I never prosess a friendship for any man except yourself without intending to mislead or to ruin him I never tell a lie to any one except yourself without meaning it should pass for truth I never speak a  word of truth without intending it should be mistaken for a lie "YOU see" continued he "that barbarian MARAT that fellow thinks I am his friend because I call myself so and we get drunk together but he is a real Savage so illiterate that he was hardly able to read the very titles of the books which he hawked about the streets but it was sufficient for him that they were prohibited and that their contents might do mischief However I must acknowledge that he has great qualifications for a Reformer he is an Atheist violent in his temper a stranger to every  feeling of humanity he deceives without address and lies without shame he is ferocious bloodthirsty capable of every kind of atrocity and my dear COUTEAU I foresee with infinite pleasure that buffleheaded profligate in conjunction with you and me is reserved to act a most distinguished character on the great theatre of the universe  HERE he concluded To do justice to MARAT I must acquaint the reader that in the absence of his friend he always spoke of his character with the same impartiality  I EXHAUSTED all my eloquence in thanking the Nephew of DAMIEN for the flattering sentiments with which he was pleased to honour me and still more for those excellent lessons of practical wisdom from the observance of which I expected to derive so much benefit  Turn them to your advantage  replied he  I desire no better test of your acknowledgments    THOUGH our time in the prison passed away tolerably well between gaming drinking swearing arguing and blaspheming our confinement at last became insupportable and we resolved to escape from it We  agreed in two days to set fire to the gaol and to lay the combustibles in so many places at once that during the general confusion our deliverance would be certain  MARAT offered instantly to cut the Turnkey's throat and his Daughter's could their murder contribute in the least degree to facilitate the success of our project "Fire and Furies" says he  they both deserve it amply and particularly my pretty brunette for her fragility  Thus this great man always held out the transgression of some other person as a pretext in order to justify himself for any much more enormous crime he was determinted to perpetrate I must acknowledge  ledge I could not hear him make the proposal without feeling a little emotion of envy that however was but natural  BUT all our fine projection came to nothing On the very day before our intended conflagration the  cidevant  Queen MARIE ANTOINETTE was delivered of the Dauphin The most beautiful Prince in the world appeared and the most admirable project vanished by exactly the same incident LOUiS XVI with his usual foolish compassion and willing to make his subjects participate in his happiness ordered all the prisondoors in the kingdom to be thrown open and the wretche confined Ravishers and Assassins  excepted to be set at liberty The Turnkey entered announcing to us the Dauphin's birth and the unexpected favour of his Majesty for which his Majesty not very long afterwards received from the Triumvirate a proof of gratitude in return as little expected  THOUGH it must occasion a small transposition in the orderly detail of my adventures I take the liberty for my own gratification to anticipate the small anecdote sollowing  ALL the Hangmen of PARIS having refused to be concerned in the King's murder saying that they were not Assassins I offered mysels to his most  Serene Highness the Duke of ORLEANS now Mr EQUALITY to do the business The  cidevant  accepted my proposition with transport I dropped the edge of the Guillotine on the Royal neck but not till after I had reproached his Majesty with his weakness in giving liberty to thr  e such men as MARAT ROBESPIERRE and myself The King looked at me uttered a short sigh and without saying a single word submitted himself to my justice I sliced off his head as is related above and thus fell LOUIS XVI in the perfect vigour of his days for the crime of having spared the blood of his subjects  CHAP V  I LEAVE THE PRISON WITH ROBESPIERRE AND MARATDESCRIPTION OF A NOCTURNAL CLUB SURPRIZED TO FIND A PHILOSOPHICAL PLATTERBREECH ONE OF THE MEMBERSTOM PAINE ANECDOTES  NOTWITHSTANDING the impatience we all expressed at our confinement while it seemed next to an impossibility to escape from it MARAT at first refused to take the benefit of his liberation He swore  lustily that he would not stir a single step at least till after the accomplishment of his favourite project He appeared like a hungry glutton torn away from a good dinner without being allowed to taste a morsel of it  "PIKES and poniards" says he  the lodging is well enough for a few days longer Death and daggers to what purpose is it to plan a brilliant enterprise without having spirit to carry it into execution May thunder crush me if I stir an inch till I set fire to the prison and have fleshed my knife in the windpipe of my sweet little brown sugarplum and her muchhonoured rascal of a father's By BEELZEBUB  I have not taken a life this twelvemonth Oons I might as well be a cripple my right hand will forget its cunning  ROBESPIERRE and I for a long time endeavoured to get the better of his obstinacy but to no purpose At last the former spoke to him as follows  DEAR and muchrespected friend are you crazy Where is the good sense of your remaining here even for a single hour when you are at liberty to leave it Consider that the very best concerted conflagrations miscarry sometimes and their success is always uncertain As to the assassination  of your dear mistress and her twopenny papa it is not necessary to relinquish the scheme entirely only for a time to postpone the execution You have my free leave to return in three or four days at most under the pretence of a visit of love to your dear brunette then cut her weasand and her papa's and every gullet you can reach at spare not the more the better in my mind You must at least acknowledge my muchhonoured friend that it will be more noble it will have a better air it will in short be more like yourself to do it in the character of a friend than a prisoner Consider besides that a man of spirit may in a single night commit more murders  in the streets of Paris than he is likely to find opportunities for in three months in a prison  To the weight of these arguments at last MARAT acceded We took leave of the  Salpétriere  together  ROBESPIERRE made us mount with him to his garret where taking a pamphlet out of his lettercase after glancing it over with a paternal eye "On the strength of this" says he  we will make a jovial night of it This is a most bitter libel upon our Sovereign Lord the King Here LOUIS the Sixteenth is set forth as an implacable tyrant deaf to the complaints of his subjects and like  another NERO delighting only in their calamities The hawker who ventures it for sale may probably be decked with an iron collar for it but I shall receive at least five or six good louis from a worthy bookseller who to tell the truth runs now and then no inconsiderable risk in ushering my productions to the public But my dear friends it is full time for you to make yourselves fit to be seen do you MARAT hire a surtout to cover your rags and you COUTEAU a clean shirt for the evening Credit me it is not beneath the attention of a man of sense to secure the respect of the world by a decent exterior especially at our first introduction into  the company of strangers Farewel for the present you will find me here at eight in the evening when I shall expect to see you  WE separated for the business of the toilette and returned to ROBESPIERRE at the hour appointed "Allons" says he  follow me my brave lads I will soon domesticate you among our Demigods  WE got down from the garret which was in the middle of the  Marsh  and after many turnings and windings through dark and narrow lanes and alleys groping for our way stumbling and swearing at length we sunk down into a subterraneous passage  Keep  close my Boys  says ROBESPIERRE "we are just at the spot" After a few steps further he pushed against a door which was not quite shut and discovered to my view a kind of cavern which served as a banquettingroom for this nocturnal society  Dii qui  us imperium est animarum umbraeque silentes  Et CHAOS et PHLEGETHON loca nocte silentia late  Sit mihi fas audita loqui sit numina vestro  Pandere res altà terrâ et caligine mersas  THE red embers of a fire almost extinguished and two lamps sputtering out foetid oil suspended by ropes from a very dirty cieling cast a sort of  The Nocturnal Club  gloomy illumination over these sons of night and their apartment At first view one would have been led to imagine that the Demi gods instead of Heaven had been by mistake conducted to the abode where the Scripture tells us there is only weeping and gnashing of teeth They were sitting about a filthy tottering round table which every moment appeared ready to tumble into pieces Each of them held in his hand or near him an earthen pot with brandy of some strong spirituous liquor from whence exhaled a most pestiserous and overcoming odour just as if the gentle breezes of Miss TISIPHONE's breath were diffused all round the chamber  Their number might amount to about thirteen or fourteen Two or three of them had but one hand and as many more but one eye Some wore surtouts without shirts and others coats without waistcoats Their breeches were clumsily patched and the foulness of their linen of those I mean who had any shewed plainly that they were not much in the confidence of their washerwomen  WE entered After the usual civilities and the ceremony of my initiation this respectable Assembly mutually interchanged several questions and replies as to the manner of passing the time in their respective prisons  for this last act of the King's grace was not less serviceable to the Demigods than to the Triumvirate  THE GANYMEDE of this Hell immediately entered with three decanters of brandy and the remains of a leg of ram for the three last comers  WITH great tranquillity I took my seat between the Nephew of DAMIEN and an atheistical Demigod by name ISNARD  AFTER having cast my squint all round the company I could not suppress my astonishment at seeing a fine Platterbreech of a most hideous aspect perched up between two sturdy  looking fellows at no great distance from me "What the devil" cried I rather in too loud a note  a Platter breech among the Demigods  "TAKE care for Heaven's sake" says MENTOR  he is a great Philosopher and worthy of his place among us Last year he murdered his mother did it with so much address and underwent his examination afterwards with so much rsolution that the Magistrates though convinced of his guilt could not convict him but were obliged to discharge him He is lecherous as a monkey and has all that animal's mischief of which he frequently gives us many  entertaining instances He is wellinformed speaks well sings agreeably and it is impossible to know his pleasant qualifications without feeling an affection for him He trundles himself here every night of our meeting and he is greatly respected by our whole society  UPON hearing this I paid a genteel compliment to the Platterbreech who received it with grace indeed I may say with an air of considerable dignity and answered me with politeness though at first a little piqued by the abruptness of my exclamation At the request of the Club he favoured us with a ballad of his own composing upon the subject of King DAVID  and the Wife of URIAH the Hittite taken from the Scripture The ballad full of obscenity and blasphemy entertained us amazingly and there was no end of our applauses  HE talked afterwards like the rest of the company with infinite good sense and energy against the Christian religion against Providence the immortality of the soul and every other dogma of the received superstition all which he burlesqued with inconceivable pleasantry calling them visions and jargon fit subjects enough for a snuffling preacher in a pulpit but little suited to the refined morality and enlightened conceptions of such strongminded philosophers as we were  REMEMBERING the late admonition of MENTOR who was always by my side I said to him in a low tone of voice  Prithee who is that heavylooking boor with his hands in his pocket sitting opposite to me He has not uttered a word since we came in and my opinion is that he does not understand one syllable of the conversation Is he deaf or dumb  "NEITHER" answered MENTOR  He is also a great Philosopher and thinks profoundly but being an ENGLISHMAN he does not understand a tittle of our language and never attempts to speak it To tell the truth he is not very well acquainted with the Grammar of  ENGLISH for he was never at school nor under the discipline of any instructor In the last war however he contrived to do a deal of mischief to his native country by his pamphlets and his treasons The ENGLISH in my mind despise him too much and talk more of his rogueries than of his publications He was originally a bungling Staymaker in ENGLAND but by the interest of a Waitingmaid who was mistress to a certain Lord's Valet de Chambre he was appointed to a small post in the Customs from whence he was dismissed for a number of little pleasantries which the folks there were pleased to call dishonesty Afterwards he married two Widows  at the same time for their little property he robbed them both and then went to AMERICA as a Patriot and a Republican where he was indefatigable in irritating the Colonies against the MotherCountry He is the very Soul of our Society Our VOLTAIRES ROUSSEAUS and D'ALEMBERTS only give us the satisfaction to demonstrate that we have no chance of inheriting a future state but this Philosopher shews us the direct road and points out the infallible means to put us in possession of the property of our neighbour and of every thing desirable in this under world to which we have not the most distant pretensions from right reason or justice To  him it is we are obliged for that beautiful idea of overturning all the established orders of society of calling Kings tyrants and dunderpates laws useless and the morality of our ancestors impositions and tales of the fairies TOM PAINE your good health  At these last words the boor pursed up his eyebrows stammered out a few words in ENGLISH and pronounced  Mountsheer  so as to be audible then thrusting his clumsy hands again into his pocketholes he made an aukward sort of bow and immediately sunk back into his usual state of stupidity  CHAP VI  DISPERSION OF THE CLUBDEATH OF THYRSISTHE BONEHOUSE AN OLD PREJUDICE REMOVED EXPERIMENTALLY  THE harmony of our Club was interrupted by an incident which happened not unfrequently in that Convention of Demigods Our Atheist ISNARD who had at his left side a member blind of the right eye suddenly complained aloud that his friend the blinkard had stolen his silver snussbox "By JUPITER" says he  I suppose Rascal you imagine I have as few eyes as yourself that  you venture to rob me in this open manner  The monoculist who was rather choleric only answered him by a sound douse on the chops which stretched him directly at his length on the floor Up bounced the whole Assembly in a moment and the engagement became general It was all cuffing kicking stabbing and howling to such a degree that one would have imagined by the ringing of the Cavern the fury ALECTO had got among us with her horn the concert was so dissonant and so tremendous In endeavouring to pick ROBESPIERRE'S pocket who was tumbled down in the scuffle I received a gash in the face from a knife the scar of which is still visible and will continue  to be so to my latest hour and what is still worse I got the wound without the plaister I mean the money I was in search of for MENTOR was too muchupon his guard to let himself be easily stripped of the price of his libel upon our most excellent Sovereign  LASSITUDE at length succeeded to choler and the honourable company separated with many protestations of mutual esteem and an engagement to meet again in the same place on the Thursday following  THE Nephew of DAMIEN who had business in some other quarter took leave of MARAT and me but  first discharged our reckoning for the leg of ram and the decanters of brandy we had guzzled down before the riot began in the Cavern  As we were sauntering up  Drytree street  I asked MARAT if he had got any money "Not a cross" answered he  by ISCARIOT But no matter we can't want it long in the streets of PARIS the first codger we meet alone by the Devil's gizzard we'll empty his pockets and then slit his windpipe blast me  So said so done The words were scarcely uttered when an unsortunate  petitmaître  of the city appeared before  us He wore an illfancied laced coat with a hat and feather under his arm and sung "Dear THYRSIS" to the utmost extent of his vocal powers with a most disengaged air and in the most perfect security O blindness to the future O improvident  petitmaître  at this very moment ATROPOS is preparing the fatal scissars to cut the thread of thy existence and if there are not songs and ballads opera serious or opera buffa in the PLUTONIAN regions thou now warblest in  Drytree street  the sweet finale to all thy music  "BULLETS and bludgeons" cries MARAT "we have him"  HE let the illstarr'd warbling beau pass by a little then turning suddenly about seized him strongly by the arms behind I advanced in front presented my knife at his throat with one hand and rifled his pockets with the other I took out his watch and his purse containing three crownpieces a smal bit of rosin two strings for a pocket fiddle and eighteen good golden louis  DURING the operation in order to display the justice of our proceeding we overwhelmed him with reproaches and the most abusive language as if he had been a public depredator not less infamous than CACUS in such a manner  that a passerby who only heard what was said without seeing what was done would have concluded that the  petitmaître  was the robber and we the sufferers  AFTER these pleasantries having cut his throat from ear to ear with all the dexterity of a surgeon without condescending to cast another look at him I walked on with my companion and left THYRSIS stonedead upon the pavement  IN the division of the booty I reserved to myself four pieces more than the half without MARAT'S knowledge giving him the remainder but in return I generously presented  him with the bit of rosin and the two fiddlestrings upon which he did not seem to set any very great value for he dashed them at my face in a fury cursing and swearing according to his usual custom upon every occasion  THE Queen of GNIDUS and PAPHOS though a Pagan Divinity has as many altars to her honour in the capital city of his Most Christian Majesty as she once had in GREECE or ITALY One of her temples was near us and received us like true devout sacrificers to the worship within Money easily produces universal tolerance among all the amorous sects who pay their homage to the Mother of the TROJANS Without being  TARQUINS we met with ladies as cold as LUCRETIAS till the contents of the purse of THYRSIS were displayed before them That once done we passed the night deliciously in their arms  My fair mate had all the charms without the austerity of that ROMAN Prude of selfslaughtering memory but having left me early to share the transports of another lover no less sentimental MARAT came into the bedchamber before I was well awake and shaking me rudely by the shoulder made me at first apprehensive that the officers of justice had laid their claws on me but the Savage soon undeceived me  "FIRE and brimstone" says he  still in bed snoring like a hog at this hour Tumble out for shame boy Lights and livers I have a party of pleasure to propose to you You know rip my vitals they expose the dead bodies found in the streets at night next morning in the bone house blast me It would be confoundedly ungrateful not to pay our compliments to our dear little THYRSIS after such a regale as we have had at his expence split me Come along gibbet me Besides the satisfaction of looking at one's handywork it may serve by LUCIFER to strengthen our courage though scorch my midriff COUTEAU you and I have  "This poor Gentleman is not likely to be a Songster"  no great need of SPA water to brace our nerves shiver me  AWAY we went and the first object which struck us was the gentle THYRSIS stretched at his length on a plank in the bonehouse with his guttural hiatus very distinguishable  "To the best of my judgment" says I  this poor gentleman is not likely to be a songster  "AH no" answered a very pretty young woman by my side drowned in tears and wringing her hands most piteously  Alas no my dear dear Brother you will never sing again nor dance again nor teach to dance  again May the vengeance of whose inhuman hand has thus cut short the course of your innocent inoffensive being  HE must have been some scoundrel  says I with great composure and so saying walked out of the boehouse  THIS little adventure furnishes me with an opportunity of exposing the futility of a vulgar notion which is common enough among the lower sort of people namely that the wounds of a murdered person open and bleed afresh at the approach of the murderer just as at the time of being mortally  wounded The fact is not so I stood quite close to the body of THYRSIS I even put my hand upon his throat not one drop of blood issued but all remained within congealed and without circulation just as if the corpse had lain for three weeks in the snows of CANADA  THUS it is that Superstition would impose upon us To abolish false opinions and to establish the true is the bounden duty of every wise man who wishes by the light of science to instruct society and improve his country It was not by idle speculations and illfounded theories but by the force of reiterated experiments that the  great ENGLISH Chancellor BACON laid open to us the right road to useful knowledge and rational philosophy  CHAP VII  DISAPPOINTED IN A ROBBERY ENGLISH SAILORSI AM SENT TO THE GALLIES  THE more I knew MARAT the more I was attached to him He was my PYLADES and without his participation I had little enjoyment of the good things of this world that is to say the good things of other people which were indeed my only inheritance While our money lasted we swam in the delights of PARIS  The God of Wine our wit inflam'd  And CUPID fir'd our hearts  But by our debaucheries and our amours our sunds were soon exhausted Four pocketpistols and two daggers were all we had to shew for the watch and the eighteen louis which we possessed after the conquest of THYRSIS the rest had been squandered in brandyshops and houses of reception  BUT knowing in spite of what the Scripture tells us to the contrary that the victory  is  to the strong we considered the consumption of our purse with great indifference By a little dexterity we supplied our ordinary demands and sufficient unto the day was the roguery thereof But little satisfied with such slender and uncertain  resources we meditated depredations on a larger scale We agreed in one of our  têteàtêtes  not to confine our ambition to the certain and inglorious plunder of single passengers but to attack all we met even in bodies without the least consideration of their strength or numbers  FULL of such heroical resolutions after a close examination of our firearms we sallied out one Sunday evening certain of returning at night loaded with the  spolia opima  But alas how many accidents happen in life against which we make no provision Never was resolution more firm never enterprise better concerted which came to so wretched aconclusion  AT the top of  Fripperystreet  we saw two lasses hanging upon the arms of two stoutlooking fellows dressed in blue who were gallanting them in ENGLISH and speaking as loud as if they had been on the open sea and staggering on the quarterdeck of their vessels They were ENGLISH Sailors  "BRIMSTONE and sulphur" roared MARAT  you Roastbeef Saltwater ENGLISH Regicides deliver your money  THE Roastbeef Saltwater ENGLISH Regicides were by no means obedient After squirting some chewed tobacco from the corner of their mouths and one of them crying out  to his companion  Blast my eyes Pirates  they answered our requisition in a manner we little expected Without shrinking an inch or discovering te least sign of apprehension they levelled two blows at our heads with their oaken cudgels one of which instantly knocked the pistol out of MARAT's hand and the other made me vibrate like a pendulum I fired notwithstanding and missed Away ran the women and the cudgels began to play about our ears most unmercifully  SEEING as we did the strength and resolution of the enemy we had no choice but flight We took to our heels and the ENGLISH Regicides  after us I understood their language and heard them close behind us now and then encouraging each other and one crying out "More sail TOM" and TOM answering "Aye aye" just as if they had been at sea and giving chace to the ships of an enemy  BEING better acquainted than the Sailors with the windings and turnings of that quarter we had nearly escaped from them when as ill fortune would have it one of our nocturnal Club the Demigod PLATTERBREECH happened to be spinning about quite close to me Somehow or other he got entangled between my legs with his cursed platter and down I tumbled MARAT fell over  me and thus were the three Demigods turned head over heels in the middle of the mud at the mercy of two furious Tars who while their cudgels descended as thick as hailstones on our carcases were all the time saluting our ears with the appellations of  Mountsheers Soupemeagre  INDIAN  Turkeycocks  meaning to call us something else a little like it in sound and  cowardly  FRENCH  hangdogs  After drubbing us to their hearts content they looked about and not finding their lasses left us to go in search of them but first seeing the Platterbreech tumbled over they replaced him in his equipage and throwing him a handful of silver from  their coat pockets with a curse or two they quitted us  THIS business may serve as a small specimen of ENGLISH Sailors Here I shall take the liberty of offering a little advice to such of my readers as may hereafter feel an inclination to rob folks of this description which is to cut their throats first and rob them afterwards by this arrangement the affair will be in a better train and less liable to such untoward accidents as I have just related  DELIVERED in this manner from our enemies we thought ourselves safe and being seated on our rumps  in the middle of the kennel began to shake our ears like spaniels just come out of the water when lo a much worse misfortune befel us than the bastinado we had so lately experienced  THE Watch alarmed by the cries of the women came up suddenly and dragged us off before a neighbouring magistrate there to undergo an examination  WHEN we appeared before the Justice MARAT thought proper from a mere impulse of modesty to withdraw from the  eclat  of his real name and to rebaptize himself by that of CLAUDIUS ARNAUD Gentleman  The metonymy was absolutely necessary for without it the matter would have been decided against us instantly We protested our innocence with so much effrontery calling Heaven and all the saints in the calendar to witness that the ENGLISH were the aggressors and our flight only the consequence of our apprehension that the magistrate began to be puzzled Observing the success of our first fiction we resolved without invoking the aid of the Gods of OVID to metamorphose all the personages of the piece and to accuse our accusers We charged the women as accomplices with the ENGLISH Pirates in a manner so solemn and with such an air of veracity  that the Justice was within a moment of becoming perfectly unjust by committing them and giving us our liberty  WHILE this point was depending one of the Marechausseé happened most unfortunately to come into the office and seeing MARAT in custody called him by his name The scene shifted in a moment  "AH ah Scoundrel is it you" says the Judge  your most obedient servant Mr CLAUDIUS ARNAUD Gentleman  HE then examined his criminal register and finding my name also  in its proper place he sentenced us both on the spot to three years imprisonment in the gallies  MARAT furious to find himself thus baffled lost all patience and vomited out such a torrent of obloquy and scurrility against the office that the representative of THEMIS in addition or as a rider to the rest of his sentence ordered him before he set out upon his trip to Marseilles to receive a hundred lashes from a cat of nine tails soundly applied to his naked shoulders and so ended our examination  THUS does the fickle Goddess delight to frolic Behold this great man reserved to be at one time the Framer of Laws the Purifier of Philosophy the Reformer of his Country the Fraternizer of EUROPE the Judge and Sentencer of his Sovereign at another period handcuffed tied to a post and skipping and writhing under the scourge of the executioner I stood by and offered him my compliments of condolence with apparent sincerity but privately I gave the hangman a small piece of money I had about me not to spare him but to lay it on soundly well knowing that had our situations been but changed my PYLADES would  have acted by me exactly in the same benevolent manner  hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim  Such little liberties among friends are always allowable  CHAP VIII  RELEASED FROM THE GALLIES MENTOR PRESENTS ME TO THE DUKE OF ORLEANSTHE DUKE ENTRUSTS ME WITH AN IMPORTANT COMMISSIONZARA IMPALED ENCOMIUM ON THE DUKE  AS most of my readers no doubt have served in the gallies it would be but lost time to describe to them the daily course of life there To make a figure there patience is the virtue most requisite Fasting the  scourge and setters are dealt out to the miserable convicts with the utmost impartiality and happy is he who can best support them The captain of each galley exercises a despotic tyranny and those who were to know the sufferings without at the same time knowing the crimes and dispositions of the slaves would imagine they were treated with the most disproportionate inhumanity The back of the horse is made for the rider and the shoulders of the galleyslave for the scourge Time however softens every thing Our most flattering consolation resulted from this consideration that there were other human beings more unfortunate than ourselves  THE wretches condemned to the oar for ten years or for life made a jest of our complaints and considered our condition as truly enviable Comparison upon the whole reconciles all calamities I knew a celebrated  Suavio  at Paris who was out of humour the whole time of the most exquisite entertainment if a glass of Champagne not sufficiently iced was offered to him while above half the inhabitants of that great city were obliged to content themselves with the wine of the country acid as vinegar and well heated with scorching sunbeams  MARAT and I little satisfied with exercising the cardinal virtue of patience meditated many fruitless projects  to deliver ourselves from captivity but we ruined our schemes by communicating them to other villains Four Demigods of our Clu happened to be chained to the same bank of oars with us and they always spoke with such bitter exasperation against the tyranny exercised over us that we concluded they would eagerly join with us in any enterprize however perilous which could contribute to our emancipation  "PILLAGE and plunder" says MARAT  leave lamentations to women liberty and vengeance were made for men Earthquakes and thunder let us turn our chains to arms and this very night dash out  the brains of this scoundrel bashaw who gives us sustenance by scruples and fetters by the ton weight  BUT the dastards instead of cooperating with us only betrayed us into the hands of the enemy Then the lash was applied in triple doses and our irons doubled in such a manner that our backs were as finely tesselated as the pavement of Solomon's Temple and we endured a burden of fetters enough to strain the loins of a stout packhorse  BUT nothing could subdue us Genius may be for a while beat down but it is impossible to annihilate it Like ENCELADUS under Mount AEtna it makes such struggles and the  efforts are so violent that its powers and energy are conspicuous under the oppression and perhaps then most formidably  LOADED as we were with irons torn with stripes and our strength reduced to half its consistence by inanition who would not have imagined that under such a regimen we should not have sunk into subjection But not so we answered chastisement by blasphemy and met menaces with abuse The Captain never ventured to approach us without a cocked pistolin his hand and two or three times protested he would blow our brains out for an example to the rest and to restore order and discipline in the gallies  But our fortune was soon to change her aspect After a year passed as described above I had a letter from ROBESPIERRE communicating to me the happy intelligence that by his interest with his Most Serene Highness the DUKE OF ORLEANS we were to be set at liberty At the same time the Master of the Galley received a letter in the Duke's hand ordering us to be released and furnished with money for our expences to Paris  THE Captain obeyed the mandate with great satisfaction and sent us out of the district under a strong guard not supposing he could be one hour in safety till we were removed at least  a full league's distance from the circle of his jurisdiction  PRISONS and the gallies are nurseries and hotbeds for wickedness and he who enters but a simple cheat or pickpocket leaves them with all the accomplishments of an assassin or a parricide This is the reason why the DUKE OF ORLEANS always chose such accomplices and associates as had either been in gaols or deserved to be in them The body of FEDERATES from MARSEILLES who in so gloriously deluged FRANCE in the blood or priests prisoners women and children was chiefly composed of galleyslaves They were in the DUKE's  pay and executed his bloody orders with a precision so exact with such sublime ferocity that the Satellites of SYLLA were not more entitled to universal admiration nor deserved better the everlasting gratitude of their suborner But let us return to our history  IN our journey we atchieved little worthy of recollection except a good many robberies and killing three shabby sort of travellers whose throats it was absolutely necessary to cut to get possession of their purses and to make sure of their taciturnity  ROBESPIERRE received us at Paris with open arms and we passed the time most agreeably in giving him the  detail of our adventures ad in listening to the recital of his O how delightful are these overflowings of the heart among true friends  Felices ter et amplius  those who can experience them  THE Nephew of DAMIEN as he informed us was become favourite to the DUKE OF ORLEANS and had the honour of being employed by him in several very delicate commissions where he had manifested considerable talents for business and great zeal for his master's service Among several other particulars of the same nature he diverted us extremely by telling us how he had by his Highness' order given poison to the PRINCE DE LAMBALLE  one day as he returned from hunting and complained of thirst and how he had forged a will for the dead Prince by which his Highness became heir to the immense possessions of that Prince frustrating by this manoeuvre the DUCHESS OF LAMBALLE and the children of that lady who would have been otherwise the rightful inheritors He assured us at the same time that his Highness was little satisfied with such frivolous operations but meditated nobler and more extensive projects of which he was not yet sufficiently master to give us the detail as we might desire specifically  "BUT friend COUTEAU" continued he  I have been thinking of a little arrangement for you before you left the gallies and pray attend to it Hitherto your travels have been confined to FRANCE To be wise as ULYSSES it is necessary like him to see foreign countries  Multorum providus urbes et mores hominum inspexit  It is necessary for the service of my patron that he should have some one of my recommendation a man of honour like you to inform him authentically of the present state of IRELAND The DUKE has heard with pleasure that there are a set of gallant fellows there called  Houghers  who hamstring soldiers in the dark and perform other such little pleasing freaks as well deserve his favourable notice He hears also that there is an Association called  United Irishmen  that is  united  against the laws religion and peace of their country and it sometimes happens that these worthy people are hanged or sentenced to transportation for want of money or a protector who by his credit might save them from that ignoble injustice which persecutes what they falsely call transgressions in countries unenlightened with true philosophy The DUKE wishes to know their real strength and numbers and to assure them of his esteem and countenance  Prepare therefore speedily for your journey I will present you this very day to his Highness who will furnish you with money for the expences of your commission and give you with his own mouth your final instructions how to regulate your conduct among strangers  DURING our conversation the DUKE came into the apartment of DAMIEN'S Nephew and on my being presented to him behaved to me with the greatest affability  "Is it really true" says he with a smile strongly expressive of the august ferocity of his heart  that you cut a citizen's throat in the streets of  Paris while he was singing  Dear Tyrsis  and next morning went to see his body in the bonehouse  I ANSWERED with modesty that it was perfectly true and that I was ready to undertake much more hazardous exploits for the service of his Highness whenever he might condescend to honour me with his commands  "We shall see" answered he  I expect your company at fix today with the Nephew of DAMIEN  HE then conversed a little in private with MENTOR and departed but not till he hd left on my mind a  most advantageous impression of his disposition by the following little incident which being willing to amuse the reader I think myself not at liberty to withhold from him  THE true character of men is perhaps better discovered by their conduct in small matters than in great events and important conjunctures At such criterions there is generally a consonance of sensation which produces a consonance of thought and determination and man is man by the leading impulse of human nature but the mind left entirely at its ease acts independently of any extraneous bias and shews itself in its real abstract propensity  WE were standing together at an open window which looks into the street when ZARA a pretty little shespaniel big with puppies left her mat in the corner of the chamber and came towards his Highness crouching wagging her tail licking his feet and offering him her little affectionate caresses He wore white stockings and whether it was that ZARA put up her paws on his white stockings or whether it was that he has an aversion to dogs I know not but he took her by the neck and extending his arm from the window let the little mother drop on the iron spikes of the railing where she was impaled immediately  WHILE she was writhing and howling in her anguish the first Prince of the Blood looked at her with great satisfaction snapping his fingers and crying out in a fondling tone of voice from the window  Come here little ZARA What are you doing there you gipsey Come to me come to your master hussey  and so on in that sort of coaxing tone which we use to little dogs when we want to trifle with them  THE Commentators of the Poet SHAKPAR the CORNEILLE of ENGLAND direct the reader to admire the following trait in the part of BRUTUS the principal character in  the Tragedy of JULIUS CAESAR BRUTUS sitting at midnight in his tent just before the Battle of Philippi observes one of his attendants who had been playing on the lute to him just dropping asleep over the instrument He rises takes it from his lap without awakening him saying at the same time in a very gentle tone of voice  If thou dost nod thou'lt break thy instrument  This little touch the critics tell us discovers wonderfully well the good disposition and natural benignity of BRUTUS' character  IT is not necessary I suppose by a long dissertation to display to the observer the difference between the Assassin  of JULIUS CAESAR and of LOUIS CAPET and how much the FRENCHMAN surpasses the ROMAN in grandeur of soul and dignity of sentiment  O THE great man the great man  cried I  he will murder half the world O the great man  "HE is a great man" answered MENTOR  who will be the maker of your fortune As such resprect him  and we parted  CHAP IX  I DINE AT THE PALAIS ROYAL CHARACTER OF THE DUKE IN HIS ABSENCE BY ROBESPIERRERECEIVE MY INSTRUCTIONSTHE DUKE DISCONTENTED WITH THE KING AND QUEENJUST CAUSE FOR BEING SOHIS MOST SERENE HIGHNESS GETS DRUNK  NEVER forgetting MENTOR'S sage maxim that the outside ought not to be neglected I paid most particular attention to my dress before I made my entrance at the palace I washed my hands and face a hairdresser  finished my red locks with great taste three serious curls and two flutterers at each side my white silk stockings were darned only in two or three places and these hardly visile I hired a clean shirt and a complete suit of clothes in  Fripperystreet  and thus equipped with a noble air I presented myself at the palace  MENTOR had got there before me and I found him in a magnificent antichamber waiting for the DUKE to join the company At seeing me he could hardly suppress his amazement  "AH ah" cried he  my dear friend you look wonderfully well If you had no face at all or any other  face but that which you have upon my honour the women would pull caps for you What curled powdered silk stockings a clean shirt and a sword by your side By the word of a gentleman you might sit for your picture but you don't perhaps know that to that face such as it is you are indebted for the partiality of his Highness The Prince saw you by accident in the  Tuilleries  and your appearance immediately fascinated him I was as usual at his side and took the opportunity of giving him an account of your adventures so advantageously for you that from that moment he resolved to have you upon his list But mark me before he  comes in let me give you a short sketch of his real character for without that chart before your eyes you may not be able to steer the vessel into her harbour  WE sat down and MENTOR thus resumed the subject  MY Lord has as much politeness as man can have and in every thing superficial is perfectly a gentleman He is precisely the very reverse of a turtle whose impenetrable outside covers the soft meat within for he is as insensible to every feeling of humanity as a tyger of Africa He is prodigal without generosity a niggard without oeconomy timid  without caution and rash without courage Good sense of which he has but a very slender portion seldom is his director He sees things not by the light of reason but through the medium of his passions and prejudices His model is his ancestor the DUKE OF ORLEANS who was Regent in the late King's minority The Regent was fond of women his Highness is as incontinent as TARQUIN The Regent sometimes loved a jovial glass his Highness is drunk constantlyThe Regent liked mixed company his Highness keeps open house for all the scum and rabble of the kingdom and so in every thing else He resembles  him in all his weaknesses and ill qualities in not one of the good and only imitates in  outréeing  the prototype He has neither the spirit the genius nor the good natural disposition of his ancestor He resembles him in short as a great Flemish Draughthorse is like a fleet highmettled Arabian Courser both are horses and there ends the similitude He loves flattery to an extravagance and particularly to be flattered for what he does not possess extensive views and the profound science of Politics in which last he is perpetually outwitted He will be or I am greatly mistaken the dupe of his own ambition for he meditates a number of bold undertakings  and is destitute at the same time of every quality of the mind which might possibly give him a chance of succeeding in them However he is a good milchcow and we will not be tired of holding the pail till he is tired of letting us milk him He has loaded me with favours and benefits and you may see my dear COUTEAU I speak of his character with the amiable partiality of a friend penetrated with the deepest sense of obligations Make then a little abatement on account of this partiality which I have just mentioned and you will then be exactly in a position to form a candid estimate of the DUKE my  patron but no more for here comes his Highness  I REFLECTED a moment upon the abatement recommended to me and to say the truth I could not discover on the side of morality what was to remain to his Highness afterwards  THE DUKE came in holding a letter in his hand which he delivered to me directed to Messieurs HEROD and JUDAS Bankers  Innsquay Ploodybridge  DUBLIN  THIS is to bear your charges in Dublin  says he  I have not confined you in your expences  only take care not to exceed tho sum mentioned without acquainting me with the occasion by letter If you should find it necessary to hire some resolute fellows to assassinate the Lord Lieutenant or Chancellor or any other great officer of state you shall have a particular credit for the purpose or for any other of that sort but provisions for occurrences of this nature are not contained in that letter which is only meant for every day's current occasions But dinner is ready we will talk of business at table  WE sat down O Idol of APICIUS O Genius of Gormandizing what an  entertainment for two scoundrels and a debauched Descendant of Royalty The sensuality of a Conclave of Cardinals must have allowed it was excellent Such  soupes  such  ragouts  such  patés  such a  dessert  and such variety of delicious wines  THE DUKE'S appetite was no disgrace to the House of BOURBON and he drank like a true Prince of the Blood Royal At every bumper his heart began more and more to open and in proportion his folly to expand itself What  platitudes  on his part and what eulogiums upon ours The contest seemed to be whether his Highness should be most dull or we most flattering our compliments were  exactly in an inverse ratio to his merit but as his Highness had little more to do than to gesticulate his acknowledgments and we had the labour of furnishing the matter for them as he was but passive and we active in the scene much the most troublesome part in the piece fell upon our shoulders  THE heat of wine and adulation having at last softened his heart to a state of fusion out it ran in a stream of indiscreet confidence as follows FRIEND COUTEAU says he  without doubt you don't believe in GOD  "GOD forbid" answered I with vivacity  I know no Divinity except your Highness  "GOOD" returned he  but it is not enough to be an Atheist yourself you must endeavour to make others so We have not any greater enemy than the Christian Religion It teaches men to be just grateful compassionate honest content with their condition loyal and I know not how many other weaknesses utterly incompatible with the new philosophy of which I profess myself a confirmed disciple  "YOUR Highness" says I  speaks with too much modesty you are an Apostle  BY agreement we then drank in a bumper on our knees the memory of SPINOSA The DUKE then helping himself largely to some perigord pye went on thus  As a cook before he makes a  fricandeau  a collar or a pasty takes the bones out to form it to his taste and render it plastic so we must try to unbone the human heart of all religion before it will receive kindly the form which it is our interest to give it  THE Nephew of DAMIEN and myself assured him upon this with equal truth and solemnity that we never had the most distant idea of any religion whatsoever nor did we know or had we heard of a single person who pretended to it the KING perhaps might be an exception but his imbecility was notorious I added with a wellurned compliment that the example of one great man like his Highness was likely to do more good than the books of twenty VOLTAIRES and MIRABEAUS with all their parts their zeal and their learning Thus satisfied on the article of our infidelity the Prince proceeded  YOU must know friend COUTEAU that we have determined to leave in FRANCE neither GOD nor Gentleman Every thing I think promises to be topsyturvy and so much the better You see in your Landlord my worthy fellows the man in all FRANCE most incensed against his Sovereign and who perhaps has the best justification for being so and you shall hear my reason IF I have any weakness it is my passion for women it must be allowed they are delicious creatures I always wish I had a hundred mouths to kiss as many arms to clasp them and a house ten times  as large as the Palais Royal to entertain them in Our Queen MARY ANTOINETTE is certainly a most desirable piece of incarnation Her shape her freshness her neck her ivory arms her beautiful legsin short the whole object taken together set me on fire and I concluded she would be an easy conquest for she was always chearful and constantly in the greatest flow of spirits After her marriage I paid my court to her with great assiduity and ogled her without mercyOne day I found her by accident quite alone at TRIANON sitting in an easy chair and knotting I threw myself at her feet in a transport avowed my passion and after protesting  that I entertained the most profoundlyrespectful sentiments of her virtue I concluded by swearing fervently that I could never enjoy an hour's happiness without the dear hope of passing the remainder of my extatic life in her celestial arms To tell the truth she appeared a good deal surprised at the declarationShe pushed back her chair a little and with a sort of stately air just uttered these few words "So I see your Highness gets intoxicated in the morning" for I was always drunk after dinner Up I bounced seized her in my arms and before she could prevent it forced a kiss from her The breath of CYTHEREA was not sweeter She repulsed  me steadily the colour mounted to her cheeks and tears stood trembling in her eyes and just at this critical moment in walked his Majesty Seeing the QUEEN so discomposed and my Highness half ashamed ened "What is the meaning of all this" says "Royalty "Turn out that Ruffian" replied the QUEEN and walked out of the chamber "What" cries the KING "make love to my wife villain Be gone and never dare again to appear in my presence BY this time I was a little recovered so I resolved to put a good face on the matter and in a sort of rallying tone "Good faith Cousin"  says I "here's a great deal said and very little done If you are resolved to banish every one who would wish to prevent your monopolizing that pretty MARY of yours you will soon have the comfort of a most agreeable solitude here at your little TRIANON" He madeno other answer to this pleasantry than giving me a great kick in the breech which made me bounce out of the room like a pellet out of a popgun SINCE that time I have hardly thought of any thing but their destruction and I see it advancing with hasty strides at this moment The QUEEN's estrangement and the recollection of that vile kick in  the breech have embittered all my enjoyments My shame shall be washed out in their blood The thunder grumbles in the air and soon will fall to crush them Our Countrymen accustomed to intercourse with the AMERICANS talk the language of these Republicans without understanding heir principles and Redress of Grievances is now become the idea most in fashion My agents are every where and never fail to traduce the KING and QUEEN as the principal cause of all the People's sufferings to describe the Nobility and Clergy as their mortal enemies and the DUKE OF ORLEANS alone as their support their protector and true friend  The Finances besides are in as fine a state of disorder as could be wished and all this working together must infallibly conduct me to the Throne  AT that prophetic word we all dropped again upon our knees and tossed off a full pint of Champagne each to its accomplishment  AT length by the dint of wine politics and prophecy his Highness' head was entirely overturned and down he sunk in his easy chair speechless and insensible The noise of his snoring which shook the diningroom gave us the first notice of the retreat of his understanding  His gold snuffbox set with diamonds lay upon the table before him and I was furiously tempted to take possession of it but MENTOR diverted me from the intention proving by a syllogism in  Barbara  that the theft might be a hanging matter and the detection inevitable My reason but not my will agreed with him and I relinquished all future hopes of that amiable snuffbox with deep regret  multa gemens  as ORPHEUS was obliged to resign his beloved EURYDICE at the borders of Tartarus or as a settingdog at the call of his master leaves the halfmumbled partridge in the plains of Chantilly "Farewel" says I "farewel too charming snuffbox" So saying I stole out of the apartment  on tiptoe leaving the drunken landlord in his armchair to snore himself sober and dream at his ease

which he had been recommitted in five days after he had been discharged from it The SWISS are said to have a disease called the pining after their country my PYLADES might be said to pine for the inside of a prison  THOUGH there is not perhaps any set of men in the community so much addicted to parade show and flutter as the Members of the Diplomatic Body I thought proper to avoid all ostentation in my preparations for my embassy  OBSERVE all Ambassadors Plenipotentiaries or Envoys When they return from their public character abroad their equipage and dress are  more gaudy They display a great deal of gilding and lace more than you meet with among their equals My Lord Ambassador squares his elbows scrapes his feet more against the floor thrusts his person more fully into your face in short he musters up the whole turkey and peacock in his deportment and is in appearance a man of greater consequence than many of superior pretensions who stand in the same circle with him but have not happened to pursue the same line with him in their progress through the world Gentry in short of this feather are perpeually in a state of declared war against nature and simplicity All this may undoubtedly spring from a laudable jealousy of not being overlooked at  foreign courts or from a desire of doing honour to the country they represent but in general it is rather to be imputed to their personal pride than their publicspirited patriotism When men's actions and conduct will bear two constructions one good and the other bad he who does not ascribe them to the latter must be indeed a novice in human nature  As to myself I had very sensible reasons for avoiding all sort of ostentation in the preparations for my embassy my credentials being only to the  Houghers  and  United Irishmen  I had no right to expect to be received in a public character by the whole IRISH nation  EQUIPPING mysels only with a small quantity of linen a second suit of cloaths for gala days in a portmanteau and a  gardvin  well filled with coniac brandy  eau de Noyau parfait amour  and other strong cordials I took post from PARIS and on the fourth day arrived without any accident at DUNKIRK  A MERCHANTSHIP bound for DUBLIN was just ready to set sail and I embarked immediately I found the vessel crowded with passengers who had got on board before me From this circumstance I was in danger of being without a bed during the whole passage which calms or contrary winds might make long and tedious But I  am of a temper rather to get the better of an inconvenience than to complain of it  AMONG a number of boobies who were on board an overgrown middleaged Smuggler of most insufferable stupidity attracted my notice He blundered out whatever nonsense happened to come uppermost told dull stories and laughed at them perpetually and drank like a camel preparing to pass the Desart of ARABIA He had an excellent bed I soon made an acquaintance with him Opening my dramchest I invited him in a bumper to drink  Confusion to all Customhouse Officers  and in another we drank "Prosperity to Smuggling"  In order to finish him compleatly I filled him a halfpint glass of  parfait amour  to his own good health then perceiving that his head and his heels began to stagger I courteously invited him to take a turn or two upon the deck assuring him he would be greatly refreshed by it I helped him immediately up the gangway then drawing him towards the gunwale with the first heel the ship made I pushed him head foremost into the sea where he was swallowed up for ever  WHEN I was certain that it was too late to fish him up again I told the Sailors of his misfortune pretending to be concerned for it I then took possession of his bed where I slept soundly  and in great comfort for the remainder of our voyage to DUBLIN The inconceivable anguish which passengers on board suffer from the rolling of the ship having as Mr VOLTAIRE says all the humours of the human frame thus violently forced out of their natural channels made me at times a little peevish but having a good bed and my mind entirely at ease I thought I had no great right to complain much about so small a matter He who has presence of mind may be truly faid to possess a treasure  OUR voyage lasted near a fortnight and but for the happy expedient which I have just before related there might I have been lying stretched on the floor  of the cabin with my head perhaps supported by a hard trunk or a basket while a pitiful Smuggler lay snoring at his ease within a few yards of the neverenoughtoberespected Ambassador of his Most Serene Highness  MUCH has been said of the beauty of the Bay of DUBLIN and to speak truth it is not easy to say more of it than it deserves In fine weather the sea looks like a great lake of a transparent blue colour neither too contracted nor too extensive The country round particularly towards the county of WICKLOW forms a magnificent amphitheatre of hills and mountains rising gradually above each other the tops of some of them seeming to pierce the  clouds like pyramids the sides of others swelled into beautiful bosoms then gently waving off and expanded at last into soft green vallies which detain and captivate the eye with the most delicious freshness and verdure On their slopes and in the bottoms you see villas and summerhouses without number adorned all about with flowering shrubs and sheltered with young plantations Old trees or of a very large growth are not common There is very where cultivation without formality and rural wildness without savageness or horror The forms of these hills mountains and vallies so diversified and so engaging the sea like a great lake the promontory of HOWTH at the entrance of the Bay on  one side the small town of CLONTARF and several other objects could they be all together collected in a single picture would form undoubtedly one of the most delightful landscapes imaginable  THE City of DUBLIN though of very great extent yet seen from the Bay or from any eminence presents nothing noble or beautiful to the eye of the beholder and this proceeds entirely from the deficiency of towers spires and steeples Of these I could count I think but two  I WILL not hesitate to affirm that the largest city in the universe with the most spacious and regular streets the most uniform houses the public  buildings in the most grand style as are those of DUBLIN nay allowing them to be all constructed of polished marble but destitute of steeples spires and towers will never make a striking object of vision or fill the eye of a spectator who looks at it from a distant view and considers it only as a component part of a picture  BESIDES the beauty which arises from a diversified surface without the aid of certain objects elevated above it the space occupied appears much less than the reality and for these reasons the sea is never seen to such advantage as when covered with shipping and we are always deceived in our conjectures as to the breadth of an  unbroken expanse of water the mensuration constantly proving it to be considerably greater than was imagined before the experiment  I FELT the most lively satisfaction in considering the paucity of these structures for as erections of this kind generally belong to temples and churches I immediately concluded that the inhabitants had little or no religion and that if they were as indifferent to the interior of worship as they seemed to be to the outside atheism and the enlightened impiety of our new Philosophy would soon make a thriving progresss among them The God of Cards and Dice has a Temple called DALY's dedicated to his honour  in DUBLIN much more magnificent than any Temple to be found in that City dedicated to the God of the Universe  THE appearance of the Mob who swarm on the Quays and block up the passages to the City delighted me greatly Covered with rags and dirt without breeches shirts or shoes full of animal spirits and the spirit of whiskey "Aye aye" says I  here is the true stuff for Reformers What a felicity must it be to live under a Constitution of their modelling  ON advancing further into the City and seeing every thing so different my  spirits sunk in proportion Appearances were changed entirely large streets shops well furnished with all sorts of commodities creditable houses an excellent footway public buildings churches excepted all magnificent and handsome carriages rolling along filled with modest and most beautiful ladies Alas thought I this does not look like the work of my Reformers the Gentry I fear have got the best end of the staff in this Capital but with the help of the Devil let us never despair of any thing  ALTHOUGH the houses in general and particularly in the new streets are well finished chearful and commodious there are not many hotels in  DUBLIN of very extraordinary magnitude  Leinster House  however is very noble and has more the air of a palace than any Hotel in Paris  Charlemount House  is very striking though not near so large as the former from the beauty of the architecture  IN this House there is an apartment called the Library which from the collection of books and the style of the ornaments would do honour to the taste of a Prince I could not look at them without wishing it had been possible for me to have stolen half of them but alas I had only the merit of feeling the inclination for the thing was impracticable His Lordship's gold watch lay by accident upon a  table and to make myself some recompence for my other fruitless wishes I slipped it into my pocket and then went away making a thousand bows and acknowledgments to the footman who held the door in his hand for me I kept the watch some time as a pleasing token to remind me of that beautiful Library and of the most resectable Nobleman who is the owner of it  ON the day of my entry into DUBLIN I dined with Messieurs HEROD and JUDAS my Bankers They received me very politely and after several Jewish ceremonies which I regarded as little as if they had been Christian they invited me to a family dinner  The company consisted of myself the two Bankers Mrs JUDAS and Miss MUSHI JUDAS her daughter The worshipful Mr HEROD was a bachelor We dined heartily upon Paschal lamb and unleavened bread and at every third mouthful drank "Confusion to Christianity"  AT my request for I did not then know the consequence that Miss MUSHI would favour the company with a song she immediately began to squall out a most tedious and lamentable Canticle longer than half of DEUTERONOMY and to complete the discord she every now and then clapped a confounded Jew's trump between  her black teeth from whence she thumped out such a succession of iron sounds as were never before heard since the Babylonish Captivity  I INTENDED toogle her all the time but unfortunately my squint turned all the tenderness to the mother who sat opposite to her This brought on a profusion of detestable compliments from that old Israelite who among the rest told me that if  Bloodybridge  had any charms for me the family hoped they should see me often The ladies then retired and my Gemini of Hebrews with their guest tossed off two bottles each of excellent  Lachryma Christi  before we thought of rising  TheDessert at Bloodybridge  VolI pa  A PARTY to the Playhouse was then proposed and we walked off together I secured a place between the two Children of Circumcision in the centre of the pit from whence I could conveniently see both the spectacle and the spectators  BEFORE the rising of the curtain the proceedings of the UpperGallery gave me infinite entertainment Their cries and howlings were more furious and dissonant than a troop of pentup wolves Now and then they dropped down emptied bottles on the company of the Pit and yet not above three or four skulls at most were broken by them then they flung chewed apples and orange peels at the boxes and upon  the Stage they frequently made the Ladies blush and the Beaus tremble hissing or clapping them just as the fancy was uppermost and sometimes giving them ludicrous nicknames which were well understood and in general very characteristical In short it was consummately pleasant to observe how miserable they made all the decentlooking people in the Theatre  THE Play to be acted as the Bills informed us was a Tragedy but the greatest part of the Actors seemed not to have been admitted into that secret They appeared entirely unconscious and unconnected with the business going forward and to assume no sort of responsibility for the pathetic incidents  exhibired before the audience Had it not been for the energy of one performer for the frequent use of the dagger towards the catastrophe and above all for the sympathy of some young ladies in the boxes I might have retired from the Playhouse without knowing whether I ought to have left my mirth or my tears behind me  THE beauty of the LADIES of IRELAND is perfectly enchanting The peasant girls of ENGLAND are in general much prettier than those of the same class in this Country but the LADIES here are full as handsome as ENGLISH Ladies and no style of beauty can exceed them O God of Love O Mother of the Graces what shapes  what complexions what features what attractions While I looked at them I doubted for near the length of half a scene whether had it been necessary I could have cut all their throats in cold blood and as a gentleman ought to do  BUT this was not the worst let me avow my shamewould it had ended there Seeing the sweetness of their looks the angelic serenity of their countenances and their bewitching sensibility I for a moment entertained the mean suspicion that there might be something real in innocence and virtue and that these fair creatures without a spark of heroism in their composition and little versed as they were in our new  fashionable philosophy might perhaps enjoy as much internal satisfaction as much solid contentment as even I could boast of But this weakness was of no long durationa moment's reflection banished it My breast recovered its usual firmness and I soon became again the worthy Ambassador of his Highness to the  Houghers  and  United Irishmen  I MIGHT no doubt have spared myself the shame of these humiliating Confessions but I promised to deal candidly with the reader so I mean to conceal nothing from him He may not perhaps find in this book the eloquence of the Citizen of Geneva but he will find at least his sincerity  CHAP XI  DISAPPOINTED IN FINDING NO HOUGHERS AND FEW UNITED IRISHMENACCOUNT OF THESE GENTLEMENTHE EVENINGPOST PATRIOTISM OF THAT PAPER WRITE A SPIRITED ESSAY TRIED FOR ITMY ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL IN THE EVENINGPOST ALIBIMAN DESCRIBED WIN A WAGERKILL A POLICEMAN OBLIGED TO FLYTAKE A PATHETIC LEAVE OF DUBLIN  GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS King of the Goths who mounted on his little white mare was  killed by a musketshot at the Battle of Lutzen but not till after he had received another wound which as his heavyheaded historian HARTE tells us made him "decline from the perpendicular" this good King used to say among other wife sayings that  we see things better with our own eyes than with those of other people  To this truth I fully subseribe in my capaity of Ambassador to the  Houghers  and  United Irishmen  IN a country containing near four million of inhabitants and where the lowest class of people are so much addicted to idleness and drinking whiskey who would not have expected to find at least one hundred thousand  gallant desperadoes under the two denominations beforementioned But mark the fact As to the former that enemy to all heroism the gallows had taken off some of them and the fear of it discouraging the rest that nursery of Reformers was rooted up and existed no longer As to the latter I could find but about five or fix who had any fixed habitation and these men in no esteem and of no sort of consequence the rest were poor bankrupt shopkeepers or idle fellows picked up in the streets to be paraded through them on particular occasions with a drum beating and a fife whistling something like a march before them A red or a blue coat was clapped upon their backs and a musket on their shoulders  for the purpose of the day After getting drunk with their officers at some alehouse in the suburbs in the evening the red coat and the firelock were taken from them they received thirteenpence and a kick in the breech and so ended the campaign and the patriotism These I found were but the miserable dregs and refuse of the real VOLUNTEERS of IRELAND who had for some time laid down their arms and who indeed consisted of the most respectable gentry in the kingdom  ALL this I mentioned in a confidential letter to the Nephew of DAMIEN but with a strict injunction that he should not communicate a word of  the truth to his Highness but keep him in his error that I might be kept in my appointment for I apprehended that my patron who loved his money would not chuse the continuance of a considerable expence merely to improve my mind and manners by foreign travel  THE DUKE it seems depended for his intelligence upon one of the DUBLIN Newspapers called the EVENINGPOST This was his Gazette and his Gospel and though it is only a compilation of gross misrepresentations and falshoods he believed in it implicitly But that indeed is not wonderful when many who are upon the spot do the same It may be considered as a sort  of reverse to the prophecies of CASSANDRA it never tells truth and is believed in general  THE enemies of IRELAND are certainly much obliged to the Editors of that Paper It is the real ivory gate of intelligence  falsa  ad coelum mittens insomnia  and you might as well look for facts in the Arabian Nights Entertainments Many of the good people of ENGLAND that most wise and credulous nation also put their trust in its authenticity but that is not so extraordinary for though there is a constant intercourse between the two islands and a narrow channel only separates them the ENGLISH in general know less of the true state of  IRELAND than of POLAND or the Empire of CHINA I myself saw a respectable Merchant of MANCHESTER who came to DUBLIN in much fear and as he thought in great peril upon some business of importance which required his presence and who seemed surprized not to find the streets barricadoed and the whole country in a state of rebellion for the EVENINGPOST told him things would be so situated in less than a fortnight  EXCELLENT consequences result from this misrepresentation on one side and this credulity on the other The ENGLISHMAN brave and open in the field is cautious in the countinghouse particularly with men of a  certain class in IRELAND who seem to think they have a sort of natural right to outwit him His cash gets the cramp when he thinks of sending it among men who laugh at him and either remains at home or goes to a distant market to enrich traders less entitled than his neighbours to any advantage from him It is computed that IRELAND loses annually at least one hundred thousand pounds by the patriotism of this single Newspaper  No engine of mischief can perform its functions better It defames all the respectable characters of the kingdom and gives every virtue to the vilest It magnifies the failure of every speculating stockjobber into  universal bankruptcy and every paltry riot into general insurrection The spirit of TOM PAINE seems to pervade its paragraphs Every evening it calls the King a Tyrant and the Parliament a Nest of corrupt Traitors bought with the money of the people to betray their interest and ready to sell themselves and their posterity to the Devil let him but assume the likeness of a guinea to tempt them All this and more is accompanied with constant complaints that the Press has lost its Freedom and that in such despotic times no man dares to speak or publish his sentiments It reminded me of a Priest I heard preach at Paris against the idle vanities of the world and who the whole time seemed to be only intent upon displaying  to the congregation a diamond ring which he wore upon his little finger  I LIVED much as may be supposed with the Editors and Friends of this admirable Paper and now and then enriched it with essays and paragraphs well calculated to raise a spirit in the readers which might be rewarded by the thanks of Colonel TANDY'S corps or by an honourable appointment under Chief Justice BARRINGTON in the BAY OF BOTANY  ONE of my Essays in particular was so uncommonly nervous that MR ATTORNEYGENERAL thought proper to take notice of it The Editor was seized and immediately gave me  up as the Author I was brought inte Court and though every man is allowed Counsel provided he is able to pay for it having before my eyes neither the sear of GOD nor of bad English I chose to plead for myself  I URGED in my defence  that I was a Patriot and in what I published had only emulated the noble spirit which appeared in all the publications contained in the same Paper that I could not conceive that to be an offence which I saw done every day with impunity that in a free country I imagined every man had a right to speak and publish whatever he thought proper and lastly that if I had exceeded a little  the motive was good and my being a stranger I supposed would be considered as a sufficient apology  THE Court I must acknowledge behaved with the utmost lenity The Judge very mildly told me  That it was melancholy to consider how much evil resulted daily from unrestrained licentiousness that the Magistrates were always unwilling to exercise any rigorous authority with which the spirit of a free Constitution found it necessary to invest them that though the utmost liberty of sentiment and communication was not only permitted but encouraged yet this was always to be understood as being subject to some  decent and necessary restrictions and that the good order and peace of the community were not to be disturbed by the wild and extravagant notions which an individual might happen to entertain of liberty However my being a stranger as I had pleaded might possibly have led me into an error that circumstance would have weight with the Jury and he would recommend to them not to find me guilty hoping at the same time that I would be grateful for this lenity and conduct myself for the future with more discretion  I MADE a bow was suffered to withdraw and thus ended my trial of  which I sent out the following account in the same Paper next evening  ON Tuesday between the hours of ten and eleven in the forenoon six Policemen broke into the house of the Editor of the EVENINGPOST and by virtue of a warrant carried off that gentleman thus torn from the arms of his helpless family together with a most respectable foreigner Mr JAMES BAPTISTE COUTEAU who was sitting at breakfast with him They were not suffered to go into a coach but dragged through the kennel in sight of their indignant and insulted fellowcitizens and in this condition thrust into the Dock of the Court  of King's Bench unprepared for any sort of defence to take their trial for a libel THE Judge behaved in the most indecent manner foaming at the mouth loading them with the most abusive language charging the Jury to find them guilty and swearing that the Court would take care to sentence them to perpetual imprisonment Out of respect to the Court we forbear to enter more into particulars The worthy Jury however did their duty and acquitted them to the infinite mortification of the Judges and the inexpressible satisfaction of all present the Bench excepted The Hall  rung with applauses the discharged Prisoners were conducted home amidst the shouts and acclamations of their fellowcitizens the Judges' carriages were broke to pieces as they returned to their houses and they would probably have lost their lives but for the assistance of the military who appeared just in time to save them from the fury of the justlyincensed populace WE hear a subscription is opened to raise a statue in plaister of Paris to be placed three steps above that of Dr LUCAS on the stairs leading to the Exchange Coffeehouse the inscription to be simply this  Public Gratitude erected it to  JAMES BAPTISTE COUTEAU  Patriot and Citizen of the Universe Citizens to arms  I TOOK care this Paper should be safely transmitted to his Highness  AN unforeseen event prevented my knowing the end of this business and how the Court punished this aggravated offence against its dignity I might have had this satisfaction without running any hazard as I had previously secured two Alibimen  Doers  as it is called of the Paper to bear me harmless so the penalty would have fallen upon the Editor  AN Alibiman is an honest Citizen always to be found by the pettyfoggers of ENGLAND and IRELAND who extricates you immediately from the danger of a prosecution by swearing falsely upon the holy Gospels to some circumstance commonly of locality which makes it appear impossible you should be guilty of the crime you have committed and of which you stand specifically indicted The Alibiman is applied to many good purposes particularly to that of saving highwaymen above half of these gentlemen escaping on their trials by an Alibi His organs of sight have this peculiar property he never sees you where you are and always sees you where you are not In short without stirring  from his cellar or garret he can if necessary identify you at thirty leagues distance and so circumstantially that he leaves no doubt of his veracity on the minds of his hearers ROBESPIERRE at my recommendation invited over a little colony of them to settle at Paris they have multiplied there greatly and on many occasions we found them extremely serviceable They live chiefly upon rice some days before they swear they have not seen you where you are and use a good deal of cephalic snuff before they swear to have seen you where you was not thus finding ingeniously a salvo for their consciences in the qualities of these two vegetables which re supposed to blunt and sharpen the visual  faculty They say and justly that if there be any thing to blame it must be imputed to the rice and snuff and not to any deficiency in their notions of moral rectitude  A WAGER which I won but was never paid occasioned my leaving Dublin abruptly My Alibi friends were much employed in endeavouring to write down the new Police Establishment substituted instead of the old Parish Watch which had been formerly the nocturnal Guard of the City  THIS Watch as it was called consisted of decrepid old men who slept generally the best part of the night in  a wooden centrybox and when they happened to be awake crawled about disturbing the repose of persons who had a right to be asleep by thumping against the streetdoor with the end of their poles and howling out the hour in a kind of ominous voice which seemed to be composed of the melody of the ass the owl and the raven So far from imparting any idea of security to Housekeepers by this sort of noisy vigilance they only reminded them in case of danger how little they were to be depended upon The Police pretty well answered the purpose for which they were established and their being besides countenanced by the Government and Magistrates were sufficient reasons for  the  Doers  of the EVENINGPOST to carry on hostilities against them  Two or three of these gentlemen describing them to me as a formidable guard ablebodied men armed with a firelock and bayonet I laid a bowl of punch against twenty folio volumes of the EVENINGPOST which they assured me was a great curiosity and the only collection of that Paper extant that I would that night kill one of these bugbears and sleep unmolested afterwards and they might be eyewitnesses of it After a few glasses of brandy at the  Cap of Liberty  in  Fetterlane  we left our liquor to determine the wager  ON one of the quays I came close up to one of the nightly Guard I asked him what was the hour and while he was looking up at the moon which perhaps he mistook for the sun to give me an answer I struck my dagger into his throat and down he tumbled His station happened to be near the corner of a street the noise of his arms clattering on the pavement made five or six passengers hasten towards the spot who seeing the dead body immediately roared out "Police" and "Murder"  As my two Alibi companions had not perhaps lately prepared themselves with rice or cephalic snuff I thought it safer to trust to my heels than to their testimony With the speed  which fear and selfpreservation lent me I soon outstripped my pursuers I ran along the quays and luckily found a boat just ready to put off with a few passengers who were to be conveyed down the river to a trading vessel which was at the moment with a gentle breeze in her favour sailing out of the harbour  I SOON mounted to the deck and like MARY STUART while the coast of FRANCE receded from her view looking back upon DUBLIN "Farewell says I  dear City with thy goodnatured gentry thy noble public buildings and thy beautiful ladies with thy lowback'd cars instead of waggons thy five coffeehouses  thy two steeples and not one church handsome enough for the meanest of thy suburbs Adieu happy DUBLIN with thy fourteen hundred lawyers above eight hundred of which are attornies with thy abundance of provisions and thy exorbitant markets with thy shops better furnished than thy warehouses and thy fresh fish floundering in the mud of thy kennels Farewell Adieu for ever I must venture for probably I should be hanged only for killing a Policeman  CHAP XII  REASONS FOR MY REGRET AT LEAVING DUBLINVINDICATION OF MY IMPIETYACCOUNT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'S WEAKNESS CERTAIN METHOD OF WINNING AT CARDSKINGS AND QUEENS AT CARDS DEPOSED BY THE ADJUTANTGENERALEXPELLED FROM BOSTON FOR ATTEMPTING TO REFORM IT  SUCH was the precipitation with which I fled from the hue and cry that pursued me and such the satisfaction I felt at finding myself out of dauger that our ship had made several  leagues at sea before I thought of asking where I was to be landed Her destination it seems was for the port of Boston in AMERICA  KNOWING that Country was lately become Republican a form of Government of which I then entertained very favourable though as I afterwards found very erroneous notions I felt no regret at finding myself obliged to pay it an unintended visit  THE manner in which I left DUBLIN affected me considerably not from any sense of remorse at having killed a Policemansuch a trifle could make no impression on mebut the loss of my appointment was a serious matter  I had before me besides the prospect of an honourable independency which I was obliged to relinquish by the unlucky issue of the accident related in the preceding chapter  MR JUDAS my Banker was particularly kind to me Besides a general invitation to his house where I was always received like one of the family his friendship I found convenient in several respects principally indeed as it gave me the fairest opportunity of having an intrigue with his wife or of running away with his daughter The attention shewn me by both these ladies much exceeding the ordinary limits of hospitable politeness put both easily in my power and though  I was some time a little perplexed as to an option I resolved finally to disappoint neither Their persons being equally disgusting a single shekel more or less on one side than the other would have immediately determined my preference Mrs JUDAS had a large command of ready money of which I could always possess myself either by my own address or the old lady's fondness and Mr NEBUCHODONEZER PISGAH maternal uncle to Miss MUSHI had left the young one a considerable fortune in bonds jewels pawns and balm of Gilead independent of the power of any of the family  THE partiality the good Banker felt for me originated in a great measure  from a mistake He was himself a rigid observer of the Law of MOSES and soon discovering me not to be a Christian he imagined I was inclined to be a Jew This is a common error A man finds you not of the religion of your country or of that where he happens to meet you so he wrongly concludes that you may be of his or of some other persuasion whereas it would be more reasonable to suppose that you are of no religion  Nullius addictus jur are in verba magistri  No man can possibly prevent the mistaken notions which may be formed of him and though I should be ashamed to admit any religious sentiment I can by no means be answerable  for what weakness others especially such as don't know me intimately may think proper to impute to me Against such unfounded calumnies I shall not enter into a serious vindication nor shall I say as the English Bishop WARBURTON to a supposed defamer of his moral character  Mentiris impudentissime  but I shall answer boldly  Look at my life and there read your refutation  But enough perhaps on this subject let me only just add that I have not concealed such weaknesses as I know are in my nature but I may sasely assert that an addiction to any sort of superstition or holy reverence was never among the number  As the vessel we sailed in was large and not crowded with passengers I did not find it necessary to dispose of any of them as I had done of the Smuggler from Dunkirk The Master of the ship an ENGLISHMAN was a heavy sort of being who seemed to mind little more than the navigation of the vessel keeping her wholesome the failors regular and taking care the passengers should be well supplied with every thing they had a right to expect from him I conceived a mean opinion of his understanding from knowing that he read the Bible every morning alone for near a quarter of an hour and that for more than twice that time the ship's company were obliged to listen to it every Sunday  I ATTEMPTED to rally him upon this weakness but to no purpose He had some whimsical notions about the Bible said it was his rudder and compass that without it he should not have known in steering which was right or wrong to tack to larboard or starboard that it was the true logbook where he kept his soul's reckoning many a chart had failed him but that never had and that he verily believed it had more than once saved him from drowning  I OFFERED to lay him a wager that let him take any man of the ship who could not swim and throw him overboard with the Bible tied round his neck and he would soon  go to the bottom in spite of that amulet "YOUNG Man" he answered  there are subjects enough for merriment without making a jest of the Bible  PRETENDING to be affected by what he said and to have some respect for his folly at times I borrowed it from him and it answered a very good purpose for becoming better acquainted with it I was better enabled to quote and to laugh at it Many men venture to do both without having read one chapter  HAD I not been copperbottomed against the worm of superstition I might perhaps have felt some little degree of reverence for the Captain's holy logbook for two or three times we met with fierce storms and were in great peril insomuch that all on board myself among the number were petrified with terror except the Scripturebelieving Captainhe alone kept the deck firm composed and undaunted and there is reason to think from his presence of mind that he saved us all from perishing He was a native of NORFOLKhis name WYNDHAM  WHEN the weather was tolerable this honest Believer myself and two  others used to make a party at whist for two or three hours in the evening and I was always successful for which I should have been thankful to Fortune had I not constantly taken care to put the event out of her power My adversaries were much more surprised than I was at finding they could never win a single rubber Whenever I dealt which I often did out of my turn I took care to give myself and my partner three or four kings and queens and to convey an ace or two from the hands against us instead of an equal number of duces or threes from my own A lookeron a stranger to whist would never have imagined that we played with the same pack of cards which ought to have been dealt  promiscuously but that the game consisted in our holding all the high cards and our adversaries the small By such necessary precautions had there been a superiority of skill on the opposite side I could have suffered no great disadvantage from it  IT is not perhaps universally known that in our rage for pulling down Sovereigns and equalizing all human things we not only dethroned our own King and Queen but that the Kings of Spades Clubs Hearts and Diamonds with their Royal Consorts shared the samefate If any FRENCHMAN especially an Aristocrate were now to presume to call these  cidevant  Kings by any other title than Citizen Spade  Citizen Club Heart or Diamond and the former Queens by any other name than that of Wife to any of the aforesaid Citizens he would be denounced to the Convention and lose his head by the guillotine on a scaffold  THIS refinement of Civicism we owe originally to the minute but meritorious attention of our AdjutantGeneral PUTHOD Willing that he should not lose the honour due to so great a Reformation in the State I have taken extracts from his letter on this important subject published in the PARIS CHRONICLE of December in the first year of the Republic Let Kings and Queens tremble while they read it The Kings  and Queens of Spades indeed and their Royal Colleagues will not affect indifference to it and probably it will have more effect on the other Crowned Heads of the universe On the subject of Cards thus writes our AdjutantGeneral  These are real extracts from a paper signed PUTHOD AdjutantGeneral and published as mentioned in the text Such absurd affectation and pedantry are hardly credible Who but a FRENCH Republican could be capable of them    WHAT do I not suffer at present from that amusement it makes me quarrel with the pretty women One hears for ever "I have got the KingI have got the Queen"  As I feel myself offended at these denominations I express my disgust at it The good people of FRANCE being resolved to have Kings and Queens no longer in their Government why should they suffer them in their Games Let us be Republicans even in our sports After we have manifested the greatest rage and hatred against the King and Queen while we are labouring by all possible means to prejudice the Public Mind and their Judges against them at this critical moment when their fair Trials are depending with what consistency can we at the same time sit down to a game where we shew such fondness for Kings and Queens nay where we pique ourselves upon  the advantages we gain by Royal Artifice and Royal Despotism There should be some Reform some substitution  Signed PUTHOD  AdjutantGeneral  To shew that the vigilant delicacy of this eminent Republican was not in vain there being a Royal Owl a Royal Eagle and a Royal Tyger in the  Menagerie  at Chantilly I myself moved in full Convention and it was unanimously voted that they should be immediately equalized and they are now called Citizen Owl Citizen Eagle and Citizen Tyger and we hear from the Keepers that they seem to be very well reconciled to it  This also was a considerable Reformation  WITH respect to Cards we must acknowledge that Kings and Queens though not to be tolerated upon Thrones are in a hand at Whist very serviceable and that whether they may be called Kings and Queens or simply Citizens and their Wives it is best to have them I know no better way of doing it than that which I have already mentioned I learned the secret from an ingenious Citizen Juggler called BRESLAW  BY such dexterity I not only contrived to win enough to defray the charges of my passage but to pay all  my expences during my short continuance at BOSTON where after a rough and sometimes and dangerous voyage of near seven weeks we found ourselves safely landed  AT my entrance into the town I expected to meet with some immediate indications of that happy species of Government which the AMERICANS had lately adopted to see some houses on fire others given up to pillage Politicians in every Coffeehouse finding fault with the Magistrates and newmodelling the Constitutionin short to see the free spirit of liquor and licentiousness acting their vagaries everywhere The aspect of things was very different An air of stillness  and quiet almost to melancholy struck a damp into my spirits few people in the streets and these either carrying burdens or walking soberly about their business no houses on fire and hardly a word of politics or Reformation mentioned Our prose Poet FENELON's description of ancient TYRE may be applied to BOSTON  ONE could not meet there as in other Cities inquisitive and idle people who strolled about to public places asking after news or gaping at strangers who happened to arrive in the harbour The men were employed either in unloading their vessels in transporting their merchandize or in making bargains in arranging  their warehouses or in taking an exact account of the debts due to them by foreign merchants The women were not less industrious in occupations suitable to their sex and ingenuity  WHAT was to be done To think of reforming this place by myself was a vain imagination It occurred to me that in a town containing fourteen or fifteen thousand people notwithstanding appearances to the contrary there must be some latent sparks of discontent and that the disciples of TOM PAINE would be well inclined to lend their breath with mine to blow them up to the glorious flame of outrage and commotion  I WAS not mistaken It was not difficult to find what I wanted I soon made acquaintance with half a dozen PAINEITES whose vinegar aspects were immediately distinguishable Being poor speculative and idle I found them of course full of discontent and abounding with theories of Reformation Their system indeed generally went no further than to the unsettling whatever was established which they illustrated by describing certain machines where if you pull out the principal pins the whole work falls at once to pieces They proved very ingeniously that men could never be judges of their own happiness that such as were satisfied with what was called the liberty allowed by the necessary regulations  of civilized society were actually in a state of slavery and that those who did not rise upon their rulers could never be considered as philosophers or deserve the thanks of remote posterity which was a much more rational object than securing the welfare of the existing generation  THESE were men exactly suited to my purposes We went into Coffeehouses and began by endeavouring to depreciate the merits of General WASHINGTON We complained that under a Government called Republican he was invested with more power and authority than the Laws of ENGLAND allowed to the King of GREATBRINTAIN What could be more tame and  despicable than the regularity and decorum of public worship when men who did not srequent churches or meetinghouses and who scoffed at religion so far from being respected for it were held rather in less esteem than those who said their prayers and complied with the insipid forms of established orthodoxy At the end of discourses of this nature we looked round at the byestanders and were not a little disappointed to perceive that they either regarded us with contempt or walked off from the place without condescending to enter into any argument with us  AFTER about a week passed in this manner my door was one morning  opened by a plain formallooking man dressed in brown who with very little ceremony informed me he was come by command of the Assembly to order me to leave BOSTON immediately that a ship was to sail from thence for PORT L'ORIENT next day that money would be surnished for my expences to any part of FRANCE on my landing and that had it not been for their respect for my country to which they thought themselves obliged on a late occasion my intemperance of tongue would have been rewarded by imprisonment or the pillory "In this manner" he added  were we obliged to dismiss that mischievous coxcomb PAINE whose jargon it seemeth friend thou hast adopted  I ANSWERED with spirit  that I would take their money though I despised it and that they deserved to be lest in their ignorance for not knowing how to treat their benefactors  FROM such benefactors as thee" replied he  good LORD deliver us But come thou no more into AMERICA or worse will betide thee  So saying he adjusted his beaver and with the stiffness of a brown post set in motion stalked out of the chamber To shew my indifference I clapped the door two or three times loudly after him and hummed a tune called "Yankee Doodle"  IN less than half an hour I was conducted to a boat between two constables and safely deposited on board  The Friendly Reception  My passage from BOSTON was so like my navigation to it that a minute detail of particulars could not entertain my readers For more than a month I had little amusement except what I could sind in cheating at cards and heartily cursing all the AMERICANS by Stripes by Provinces and Individuals from General WASHINGTON downwards not forgetting my Automaton in brown who denounced to me my expulsion from AMERICA  CHAP XIII  ROBESPIERRE GIVES ME AN ACCOUNT OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND OF OTHER FRIENDSVISIT TOM PAINEHIS EMPLOYMENT GOOD EFFECTS OF HIS PAMPHLETS VISIT LONDON AS AN HUMBLE FRIEND TO THE MARQUIS OF FAUXJEUCHARACTER OF THE MARQUISENGAGeD AT THE TEMPLE OF HEALTH WITH DOCTOR GRAHAMDIVIDE WITH MY MASTER THE CONTENTS OF HIS STRONGBOXRETURN TO FRANCE  ISPENT not an hour at Port L'Orient more than was necessary to receive the money promised me for my  travelling expences and to hire a good chaise to convey me to Paris While the BOSTONIAN was counting out the cash I was employed in whistling "Yankee Doodle" and in cursing CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS for having discovered AMERICA The Puritan looked at me with disdain but only answered that I was a foulmouthed ruffian beneath the notice of any thing in a human shape except the hangman  ON my arrival at Paris I learned from ROBESPIERRE who was just released from prison where he had left MARAT in consinement for three months longer that the first Prince of the Blood had been for some time in London  "HE is gone there" says he  with one of those fine projects which get into his head like infected people into a pesthouse because they will be no where else admitted and what think you is it No less than to persuade the Ministers of ENGLAND to begin another war with FRANCE promising to deliver into their hands Brest and Brittany provided they will engage to assist him in deposing our King LOUIS and raising his Most Serene Highness to the throne instead of him Now pray observe with proper respect the abundance of absurdities with which this scheme is pregnant First our patron is neither assured of the disaffection of the people of  Brittany nor of the disloyalty of the Governors of that Province and the whole Marine hold him in contempt for his cowardce of which too many of them have been witnesses After having behaved ill at sea he resolved to wash out the memory of his disgrace on one element by shewing he could be more frightened upon another but you know the epigrams and his poltroonery is a trite topic His Balloon expedition only served to fix the seal to his former character A fearful man may have a hundred good qualities but he ought not to attempt to be a hero So much for his ground in FRANCE As to ENGLAND the people there were tired of the last  war long before its conclusion and are but just beginning to respire from it besides to speak sincerely I believe that nation is still so infected with the old vulgar exploded notions of good faith honour and loyalty that I am persuaded notwithstanding the provocation we have given them to retaliate they would foolishly scorn to avail themselves of any advantage over our country by what they would weakly call baseness and treachery As to you my dear and most respectable friend the DUKE having left no provision for you and to beg or work being beneath a Gentleman you must of course you know  either rob or starve Should you be detected in the former we have now no ORLEANS present to save you from the wheel or the gibbet but while I am your conductor  Teucro duce et auspice Teucro  fear nothing A PARTICULAR friend of mine the MARQUIS OF FAUXJEU sets out immediately for LONDON and wants a companion and valetdechambre to attend him I will recommend you The MARQUIS has as good a right to his rank as half the titles in Paris that is to say though he has no estate he has letters of nobility written by himself and he makes as creditable an appearance by the sums  he wins by cards and loaded dice as any landlord in FRANCE by the revenue of his mills his corn or his vineyards Three years ago the MARQUIS was a Pastrycook at Amiens and but yesterday he dined upon another Cook's  patés  at COMTE D'ARTOIS' table The MARQUIS finds the Police here are beginning to grow a little peery about him and as there is nothing he dislikes more than answering impertinent questions he is determined to fet off tomorrow for another kingdom where there is less curiosity and more money As he knows I am acquainted with his history he can refuse me nothing so make ready for your journey  He will play his own cards in London and we need not wish him good fortune for he always carries that Goddess about with him in his pocket I am certain you will be very happy together and when you have leisure I shall be glad to hear that you are so  I THANKED the Nephew of DAMIEN and then made some enquiries about our friends particularly about the Members of our Subterraneous Society  "ALAS" answered he  of most of them I can only say as TULLY did of the CATILINARIANS "they lived" their God the Devil played  false with them their noble bones are still preserved in iron but you must ask the kites and ravens what is become of the rest of their carcases  "BRAVE Souls" cried I  they died no doubt as men should do no whining no repentance  "No" says MENTOR  quales ab incepto  all drunk cursing the priests who attended them jesting with the crucifix and denying the facts for which they suffered I saw the execution of most of them and should have been present at them all but unluckily I was obliged just at the time to attend my own trial for twoor three forgeries and should have  shared their fate had not the interest of the good DUKE saved me  "FORTUNATE enough" says I "and is PAINE hanged too"  "NOT yet" replied MENTOR  but though as yet he has only brought his friends to the gallows he is I think scribbling his own way to it with great certainty Whenever he dies he will be found not like his hero CATILINE  inter hostium  but  inter amicorum cadavera  for his pen is likely to be as fatal to his partizans as the sword of that gallant ROMAN was to his enemies But farewel I have business Should you get to speak with the  DUKE in LONDON try to hasten him over for you may assure him from me that things here are drawing to a crisis  BEING resolved to pay a visit to TOM PAINE before I waited upon the MARQUIS I detained MENTOR for a moment to get a direction to the former's garret and then we parted  I FOUND TOM's habitation in one of the dirtiest Quays of Paris The situation might have pleased HORACE that great Lyric Poet for there was nothing to prevent his striking his sublime head against the stars but a decayed roof of lath and plaister This great Theorist was sitting crosslegged on  a dealboard and when I entered was working intently at a pair of blue canvass jumps His board was strewed over with thread tape whalebone scissars parchment measures a bit of chalk a bit of bees wax and a thimble Among these implements of his occupation I saw a pen and ink and an ENGLISH Spellingbook and several pieces of coarse illcoloured paper serawled over with different titles such as "Common Sense" "Rights of Man" "Letter to DOCTOR PRIESTLEY" "TO LORD S"" and many others written so indistinctly that I could not read them  HE received me rather kindly invited me to sit by him on the board  and shook me by the hand as a brothermember of the Club of Demigods As I could speak English and he shewed no unwillingness to talk of his own affairs we conversed for above half an hour very freely  IT gave me some small degree of concern to hear that his situation was upon the whole very uncomfortable The DUKE OF ORLEANS he told me allowed him a small pension but it was so ill paid as to be hardly worth his acceptance his writings he said brought him in but little for what with paying a kind of a scholar to take care of the spelling and grammar and another for translating them into the French language a small pittance  indeed came to his portion His best reliance was upon his needlethe women of the neighbourhood liked his work and though he seldom made a pair of stays he had a good deal to do in the way of mending  "BUT" added he  the good effects which I see produced by my writings console me for everything Before the people of this quarter began to study my pamphlets they were the most thoughtless chearful happy beings imaginable They eat their  soupe  with a good appetite and as DOCTOR GOLDSMITH says "Trimmed their robes of frieze with copper lace" sung danced and chattered without ceasing but not so nowthey  neglect their dress sleep ill quarrel with their neighbours envy the rich abuse their King and hate the Clergy In short they are become so morose so speculative and so melancholy that they find now no relish in any thing Hardly a week passes that three or sour don't throw themselves into the river and the gaol is of late twice as full of prisoners as was ever before remembered This you see my friend is the way to turn a nation of monkies into a nation of philosophers and when society is as it ought to be brought back to a state of nature when the lordly savage Man is again his own master without any restraint from laws divine or  human upon his appetites then I say let not TOM PAIE be forgotten  HERE he ended and we rose from the board together I slipped into his hand a piece of six livres Observing he had no shirt I promised that evening to send him a couple assuring him I could do it without any inconvenience as I always for the suture intended to wear my Master's He thanked me sat down again to his needle and I repaired to the lodgings of my new master  THERE could hardly be imagined a greater contrast than between the ENGLISH Philosopher's garret and the  apartment of the FRENCH MARQUIS All was misery in the former and in the latter all was magnificence  WHEN I was ushered in to his Lordship I found him under the hands of his Hairdresser studying a little treatise upon the calculation of chances He started a little at seeing me an impression which the first sight of my figure often occasions but soon recollected himself and upon hearing my name "Aye aye" says he  you are the young man for whom MONSIEUR DE ROBESPIERRE interests himself that is sufficient But come take the comb from PICARD and let us see a little of your performance  I DID as he ordered me and used PICARD'S instrument so much less like a comb than a harrow that the MARQUIS bending and groaning beneath it was soon obliged to cry out for mercy and PICARD finished the operation  As I looked a little disconcerted he told me it was no great matter I was to consider myself rather as his companion than his servant though I could not dress hair I understood English which to him was of more consequence and many a man could make a cake who could not make a pasty  UPON better acquaintance with the MARQUIS I found all his conversation  tinctured with his two vocations the Pastrycook and the Gamester When he was in danger of being detected by cheating at play too openly he used to say  That he had like to have overheated the oven  or  Make the crust brown but don't burn it  When I flattered him as I often did too grossly the reproof was  Too much sugar in a tart is as bad as too much acid  All his vexations were typified by ill luck at playsuch as "Lurch him at four"  He had rather lose a louis d'or to a livre    May I be found out at a renounce with the game in my hand  and such like so that an observer might soon discover the Man of Fashion and the Marquis were but assumed characters  and the Cook and the Gamester were the real Upon the whole however he was goodtempered had much the appearance of a Gentleman and like the COMTE DE GRAMMONT except that he always cheated at cards and dice was a Man of strict Honour  As his trunks were already all fastened to the chaise with his heavy baggage the keys of which he delivered to me at night we had nothing to do but to throw ourselves into the vehicle next morning We set off from Paris with two servants mounted and four horses to our carriage and lolling at our ease bespattered many a  Croix de St Louis  whose whole yearly income would not have been sufficient  to defray the expences of the MARQUIS to Calais  HE stepped into the chaise with a small box under his arm which he said contained his fortune  and that Pye small as it looked was better worth opening than all the rest put together  This short characteristic encomium immediately excited an appetite in me to taste the contents of it and the poor MARQUIS found to his cost not very long afterwards that I knew how to relish a good thing as well as himself though I was not like him bred a Pastrycook  AFTER we got to Calais four hours and a half carried us from our own  country into a better It is strange that the separation of a few leagues of salt water should make such a difference between two nations It is not such a difference as you are made sensible of by comparing and close examination but it is such as strikes you immediately and which you can't avoid perceiving  THE language of the two people is not more unlike than their features complexions manners dress and diet Their carriages their cattle their habitationsnay their very fields are different Many things are flimsy in FRANCE most things are solid in ENGLAND Vanity predominates in the former and in the latter pride  A FRENCHMAN displays his consequence an ENGLISHMAN conceals it The human face which in general is brown with us seems to have been washed fair in ALBION Our Ladies have taught those of ENGLAND how to converse and in return may learn from them in many points female delicacy and decorum Without half the vivacity of FRENCH Women the ENGLISH have a deeper sensibility and more purity in their thoughts and manners Our cattle are small lean and feebletheirs are large fat and vigorous FRENCH vehicles are ill constructed heavy and rumblingthose of ENGLAND are compact light strong and excellently finished Imposition is pretty common in both  countries but an ENGLISHMAN pockets your money as if you was paying his demand a FRENCHMAN as if you was conferring an obligation They may beat us or we may beat them but the two nations will never assimilate  As a readyfurnished house at the Court end of the town was secured for the selfennobled Pastrycook before his arrival we had little more to do than to take possession of it The MARQUIS was soon visited by several of the fraternity who brought with them some young ENGLISH Noblemen and Gentlemen of rank and fashion their pockets well lined with cash and their breasts entirely free from suspicion His eyes glistened at the sight of them  I considered them as fowl ready for the market and my Master with his associates as the forestallers  MOST Gamesters especially FRENCHMEN are Beaus The MARQUIS was one of the best dressed men in London and I was as well dressed as my Master With respect to cloaths I was  alter et idem  for whatever he took off on one day I wore on the next If you wished to know how the MARQUIS was dressed on Monday it was only to look at me on Tuesday and it must be acknowledged I made a very respectable appearance I took care that my Master the only person probably who would not have approved of my toilette  should not see it so I avoided his unseasonable criticisms  AFTER the description I have given of my countenance and of the stern ferocity of my temper the World no doubt will be surprised to hear of my being inlisted in the service of the Ladies and of my having made no small figure in the annals of Intrigue I speak not of the erratic Venus of  St Giles  the delight and scourge of the district nor of those nightwandering Nymphs those yielding Dryads of the  Park  who shun the faithless light of lamps and hide their charms under friendly shades and in mysterious bowerswith such I should have had  few rivals such adventures shall not debase my records but without more presace I will acquaint my reader with the circumstances which led me to unexpected honours in the field of gallantry  I HAPPENED to be in London exactly at the time the celebrated DOCTOR GRAHAM opened his TEMPLE OF HEALTH in  Pallmall  This incomprehensible Mountebank acquired a very respectable livelihood by giving edisying Lectures and admirable Experiments in the mystical science of population The Lectures of this worthy Professor were well attended but the Experiments much better Illtreated or neglected Wives went in crowds to  the DOCTOR to get a remedy against spleen and vapours Sometimes it was a Lady of Quality who had not yet the happiness to bring her Right Honourable Bodkin of a Husband an heir to his estate and titles Sometimes it was the gentle timorous Housekeeper of a brutal Citizen As the felicity of her sensual Goodman consisted either in gormandizing turtle or in guzzling porter with a Club of Cuckolds like himself and as to close the domestic scene he only snored away the night by her fair side his tender Helpmate was compelled by necessity to seek for such consolation as the TEMPLE OF HEALTH could furnish Besides these already mentioned came in a shoal of unblushing MESSALINAS  under no such fair pretence or colour as the titled Dame or the yielding Shopkeeper from  Threadneedlestreet  ONE morning I happened to cast my eye over the DOCTOR's Prospectus and having already experienced some mortifications in my progress as a pickpocket while my abilities to add to the number of his Majesty's subjects remained untried I resolved to offer my services at the TEMPLE  BEING well dressed and assuring myself that the Herculean vigour of my muscles would get the better of the singular hideousness of my countenance I strolled with a disengaged  air to the edifice erected to rationalized incontinence  THOUGH I am persuaded the DOCTOR's learning did not go beyond  Propria quae Maribus  he had decorated his door with a GREEK motto While I was looking at this and endeavouring to expound it the porter perceived me and opening the door "That is Greek my good friend" says he  you are knocking your head against there I believe you will find it too hard for you  I was of the same opinionso stepping forward I told him at once my business Instead of answering me the varlet laughed in my face and was going to  shut the door upon me but I prevented it by seizing him stoutly by the collar and tumbling him down upon the pavement  THE noise of this scuffle brought the DOCTOR down suddenly who hearing my explanation admired my strength approved of my intentions and engaged me in his service  To be sure  says he  your countenance is not very attractive but there is an air of Sons and Daughters in your appearance which with a little good management may serve to procure you a decent livelihood  IT was agreed between us that I should return to the TEMPLE about  twilight at which time he insormed me the mysteries began to be celebrated Before I left him I was not a little surprised when opening the door of a closet he shewed me a number of beautisul masques for males and females The substance on which they were painted was of a tenuity lighter than the finest gauze with apertures for the eyes mouth and nostrils He shewed me how to sasten one of them on and when I looked in the glass I became almost enamoured of myself like another NARCISSUS  "By this device" says he  besides the advantage of concealment to persons of very nice sentiment  and delicacy who frequent this place to make Experiments you see we assist Nature We conceal where she has played the stepmother and all is displayed to the best advantage where she has been bountisul  IN this place I can't avoid expressing a wish that many Ladies wom I have seen both in FRANCE and in ENGLAND would adopt the DOCTOR's method of assisting Nature instead of plaistering themselves as they now do with white lead and cinnabar Besides that the masque is no way prejudicial to health it is put on or taken off in a moment it has no offensive odour and it is no more an imposition than the other artificial crust which is  so much in fashion That Homeliness should use such artifice is not extraordinary but that Beauty as we often see should have recourse to it is indeed unaccountable  WITH the DOCTOR'S masque and my own muscles perhaps it is not necessary to assure the Public that I assisted at an infinite number of Experiments Two Gentlemen from the town of ATHLONE in IRELAND excepted I may venture to say without vanity that I was the savourite of the TEMPLE How many families at both ends of the town may have been obliged to me for those pretty little prattling cherubs always so endearing to their supposed fathers I can't pretend exactly  to determine the number certainly must be considerable  At length however I began to grow disgusted with variety and attached myself principally to one votary who brought me devotion and money in abundance One would have imagined that this kind Matron had taken upon herself alone the population of a whole parish so insatiable was her appetite for Experiments All the money she could wheedle or steal from her Cuckold came into my hands constantly But great as were our resources our expences were still greater  AT last it became necessary for me to look into the contents of the favourite little Pasty of the unsuspecting MARQUIS I was pleased to find in it what susficiently justified the Owner's partiality I made a division with him To myself I appropriated what might be called the most savoury part about four hundred guineas in rouleaus all the notes to a very considerable amount upon different Bankers in London two pair of loaded dice and all the rings with real diamonds with all the other jewels I did not even touch several packs of cards properly made up for his purpose further than just to look if there was any thing valuable under them I left him all the  rings and jewels with false stones many in number and some very pretty and eight pair of loaded diceso that I did not deprive him of the means to recruit his fortune at least as honourably as he had acquired it  BIDDING then an eternal adieu to both my Masters the Pastrycook and the Mountebank to PALLMALL the TEMPLE and the MATRONSand staying only to change my notes with the different Bankers I popped myself into a postchaise and found myself next day restored to my dear native country  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
