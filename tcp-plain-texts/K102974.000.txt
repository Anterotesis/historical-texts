 THE ROYAL SUPPLIANTS A TRAGEDY  THE ROYAL SUPPLIANTS A TRAGEDY AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  DUBLIN  Printed by J and W PORTER For S PRICE W SLEATOR W and H WHITESTONE R MONCRIEFFE C JENKIN T WALKER R BURTON and P BYRN MDCCLXXXI  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY LORD VISCOUNT PALMERSTON OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND THE FOLLOWING TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED BY HIS LORDSHIP'S OBLIGED AND MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT  J DELAP  Advertisement  It may perhaps be necessary to acquaint the reader that Euripides has written a tragedy upon the same subject In his  Heraclidae  Macaria is sacrificed in the second act and never afterwards mentioned and  Acamas  is a mute Indeed the whole conduct of this play is so entirely different from that of the Greek poet that the author is hardly conscious to himself of having borrowed any thing more from him than the general idea of the  Suppliants  taking refuge in the temple and Macaria's voluntary offer of her own life  PROLOGUE  Written by a FRIEND  WITH countenance thrice chang'd from red to pale  Our author sends me forth to tell his tale  Croesus said hewho rul'd those lands that lie  Croesusthe Nabob of Antiquity  When satiated with war with wealth with praise  Defir'd new pleasures still to sooth his days  And publish'd vast rewards sure out of spite  To him who should produce some new delight  This flame unquench'd burns on from age to age  Panting for novelty you seek our stage  To please this taste a classic bard will try  To make soft bosoms heave a classic sigh  Feel Deianira's faded charms and trace  Alcides' godlike virtues in his race  Hard is the task who strives your praise to gain  And hard the part a poet must sustain  Herculean labours might our Prologue fill  And prove the club less powerful than the quill  To clear the course to turn the tide of wit  To charm the watchful dragon of the pit  The Hydra's hiss to check the giants quell  And bind the barking Cerberus of Hell  Might the best strength of Hercules require  Tho' to his force were added Orpheus' lyre  Yet will we not despondAlcides' race  In every one's remembrance holds a place  The tale has trembled on each infant tongue  The tale that Busby taughtthat Dryden sung  This night attend one generous tear bestow  To weep the hero's wrongs the daughter's woe  Like kind protectors grant the widow's suit  And crown your poet with the golden fruit

round an Altar near the Temple of  Jupiter  IOLAUS  HERE wretched outcasts poor remains of friends  To him who once was Hercules rest here  Jove's altar be your refuge May it check  Eurystheus' impious rage and like a tower  Baffle the bloody tyrant who from Argos  Exiles the royal race and now forbids  Each state to shelter our distress Thine only  Athenian Demophon remains untried  Grant heaven  Enter HAEMON  Oh Haemon never to my eyes  More welcome was thy presence Faithful servant  Is Deianira is Macaria lodged  Safe in yon shrine  Haem  Spite of Eurystheus' spies  Who chaced their flight by the moon's waining orb  Befriended safely in yon shrine are lodged  Mother and daughter  Iol  Gracious are ye gods  And my soul bends devoutly to your thrones  For lives preserved far dearer than my own  Haem  Th' imperial widow there of great Alcides  Mourns with a mourning universe the fate  Of her illustrious lord in whose sad tomb  Lye buried all her hopes  Iol  Grant her good heaven  That fortitude her age requires to bear  The mighty loss For oh her feeble frame  By woes made feebler and the thousand perils  Of this dread flight  Haem  With toil and grief o'erpower'd  Nature gives way and in short broken slumbers  A transient respite feels Through the lone ile  At daybreak I drew near and saw Macaria  With anxious tenderness scarce breathing o'er her  A sigh that would not be supprest broke forth  While from her eye halfglimmering with a smile  Stole such a tear as burnt upon my heart  Strait I retired unseen Oh Iolaus  What can thy love thy wisdom now devise  To turn misfortune's torrent that bears down  Each rising hope  Iol  This day decides our doom  Haem  If Demophon reject us  Iol  We are dust  Before the whirlwind of Eurystheus' wrath  But lead me to the temple  Haem  The gate opens  And lo Macaria  Iol  What a soul of sorrow  O'er her wan visage melancholy throws  Its mournful ensign yet that conscious air  That decent dignity which makes grief proud  Of such a consort mark her for the daughter  Of the world's hero Haemon to the city  And learn if any herald be arrived  To cross our purpose  Exit  Haemon  MACARIA descends with Virgins  Everhonoured lady  If that an old man's aid  Mac  I will shake off  not regarding  Iolaus  This feebleness My powers lose not your functions  Softly dear virgins softly the least whisper  Wakes her A little longer balmy sleep  Spread thy still pinions in oblivious dews  Her senses steep a little longer yet  Grief soon enough will rouse them How I haste  To know the worst can happen Iolaus  So soon to see thee after our dread parting  My virtuous friend  Iol  Welcome to my sad heart  As the dear drops that nourish it But whither  Goest thou sweet maid with such disorder'd step  No new affliction  Mac  In a breast o'erflowing  Like Deianira's can misfortune find  A place for new affliction yet poor queen  Hopeless she talks of hope and would gild o'er  The sorrow that consumes her with a smile  In pity to her daughter Oh that fiend  Eurystheus the detested cause of all  Think of his fierce immitigable hate  To Hercules Think with what fortitude  My noble sire sustained a life of labours  That savages would shrink from And shall vengeance  Sleep till the wretch exterminates our race  First down to TartarusOh pardon pardon  My nature's rashness I am calm again  I'll listen to thy council which has ever  Been wise and wholesome for unless thy friendship  Still lends thy sheltering succour to thy queen  Iol  Ah what can I alas feeble old man  Mac  Let her but hear thy voice Alas alas  To wretchedness like her's the very voice  Of friendship yields relief Let her but see  Thy pitying eye but not suffused with tears  Thou good old man no dry thy tears and speak  Fallacious tho' they be some lenient words  That sound like comfort I the while will go  Why shrinks my heart Why faulters thus my tongue  As Demophon were dangerous I'll go to him  Iol  Unknown unguarded go to Demophon  Uncalled Thy heart Macaria well may shrink  And thy tongue faulter I have caught th' alarm  Thy filial piety too generous maid  Unwarily betrays thee  Mac  Well I know  Thy friendly fears he is not Acamas  That high heroic spirit who amongst  The foremost sons of Argos famous stood  'Twas not in praise of Demophon the tongue  Of fame grew lavish  Iol  But from Acamas  His brother there's small hope all kingly power  Is lodg'd in Demophon be counsel'd then  Till his heart's soften'd to receive thy suit  Quit not the sanctuary  Mac  More forcibly  Than fear can counteract an unseen hand  Urges me on I feel I fell within  A more than mortal earnest of success  Let not thy doubts oppose it Oft I've heard  There is an eloquence in artless grief  Of power to melt the sternest I'll essay  That power on Demophon  Iol  My words are vain  Go then Macaria if it must be so  Obedient to thy monitory call  And Dryas thou and ancient Amycus  Silent attend the princess You are suppliants  Soliciting relief let every look  And every motion suit that humble state  Mac  Wise Iolaus is thy wary charge  And now inspired with boldness on I go  Secure in heaven  Exit  Macaria  attended  Iol

fate  Has now to give me  Enter HAEMON  Haemon back so soon  What tidings dost thou bring  Haem  Tidings to thrill  Thy heart with horror Scarcely had I entered  Yon winding vale when suddenly I heard  The steps of men advancing Eagerly  And all at once sometimes they seemed to talk  Loud was their leader's voice above the rest  And soon his cruel eye and haughty port  Proclaimed him the stern herald of Eurystheus  Iol  Alcander  Haem  He whose rancorous revenge  Pursues us thro' the world  Iol  Remorseless villain  Yet Haemon villain as he is fear not  This shrine's our sanctuary its awful God  Whose word controuls the fury of the floods  Shall baffle the base plots of impious men  Haem  Heard you that shriek  Iol  It was Macaria's voice  And lo AlcanderHaemon rush between  She's

authority  Devolves on AcamasI'm Athen's king  And I forbid all force  Alcan  Why then by force  Dost thou withhold the vassals of Eurystheus  Aca  Are they not suppliantsTo violate  The rites of hospitality reject  The poor man's suit who only has his prayers  His humble prayers and miseries to protect him  Would make the good gods shudder on their thrones  Enter MACARIA from the Temple  Mac  'Tis Acamas himselfrestrain me not  A thousand doubts a thousand apprehensions  But a lov'd mother's dangers drive me on  They put a tongue in the mute lips of fear  Inspire me with new courageOn the ground  Trembling I clasp thy kneesOh Acamas  If ever thou hast felt as sure thou hast  The tender touch of natureIf the anguish  Of a sad daughter for the best alas  The wretchedest of mothersmy

 The most remorseless wretch  Aca  Rise royal maid  Of every wish secure The utmost grace  My power can grant his daughter well may claim  Whose godlike friendship from the realms of death  Rescued my sire  Mac  Tears are but fruitless thanks  Yet are they all th' unhappy have to give  Take them and let thy charitable heart  Supply the restNow say thou bold bad man  to  Alcander  Alcan  I waste no further wordsIf thou respect'st  to  Acamas  The friendship of Eurystheus render back  These fugitive remains of Hercules  That public ravager  Mac  Inhuman russian  Whose savage tongue even wretchedness insults  Insults the ashes of that god on earth  Who could he hear such profanationRise  Thou mighty spirit clad in horrors come  Forth from thy tomb even at thy very look  This wretch his tyrant every slave thro' all  His host would quake to death  Alcan  Such pageantry  Suits not Alcander whose indignant king  Expects an answer  Aca  Take this answer back  First tell thy king what thou at Athens seest  Tell what thou hear'st then say while Acamas  Rules in this land of liberty no tyrant  Shall force our injured suppliant from his shrine  Alcan  Hah is this Acamas not more for valour  Than wisdom famedNot thus if I know aught  Of reverend Thestor whose divine forecast  Makes him oracular not thus would he  Counsel his king Consult him be not rash  Thou speak'st the fate of

restrain  Those lovely tears I swear no power on earth  Shall harm Macaria while these arms can bear  The shield and sword before her  Mac  To the queen  With heart o'erflowing suffer me t' impart  This gracious goodness Would to heaven my Hyllus  Were present now to share it the young soldier  Of generous Acamas  Aca  Would heaven he were  I long to clasp him Iolaus send  A herald forth I long to lead to war  The brother of Macaria  Mac  Heaven that knows  How much he wants a friend like Acamas  From its blest fount thy charity repay  Exit  Aca  My tongue makes no replyI cannot stop  I cannot follow herHow quickly oh  How subtly something steals thro' every vein  Another soul I think  Enter an OFFICER  Offi  Far as the eye  From yonder tower can reach a cloud of dust  Darkens the air while thro' it break by fits  Bright transient flashes such as to the sun  Glitter from pikes and helmed heads it seems  Hitherward moving  Aca  On my life Eurystheus  The usurper by this fraudful

lord  Aca  Thou Menas with thy troop  Shalt guard this temple and its royal guests  Till my return from th' onset Would to heaven  I were sole combatant in single fight  Shield against shield to grapple with yon tyrant  Beneath Macaria's banners 'Twas at Argos  My eyes first caught her charms and here my soul  Each hour is more her captive Fancy dwells  Enchanted on th' idea on my ears  Still

defy Eurystheus  Should he by priestly phantoms terrified  Refuse to fightshould he presume to yield  To yield Macaria horrible surmise  "Be my protector" was the dear maid's prayer  Upon her trembling knees Thou holy altar  Hear and attest my vow I will by heaven  Exit  Enter ALCANDER  Alcan  Yonder he stalks and all full freedom leaves me  To work upon the priest and credulous king  And

Acamas  He is a rock will wreck us Demophon  Is jealous of him on that jealousy  I'll strike a dangerous superstitious spark  Soon to flame forth At Juno's temple now  He makes a holy halt the interim's mine  Here with old Thestor Wherefore loiters thus  The reverend dreamer whose high sanctity  The magic power of gold must move to murder  Enter THESTOR  Oh art thou come at length my ancient friend  Ancient but ah how unimpaired by age  Time that digs deep his furrows on most brows  Only gives comlier grace to Thestor's years  Adds reverence to the hairs it silvers o'er  Well we are once more met my king's concerns  Call us in haste together they are weighty  Nice urgent full of dexterous enterprize  And ask thy secret sudden aid  Thes  If they  Aught of religious import bear as what  But sacred purposes claim Thestor's counsel  Impart them to the servant of the god  Whose conscientious mind  Alcan  I know it well  Well as I know thy zeal thy friendly zeal  Proved oft in times long past which now Alcander  Means to prove home again Nearer good Thestor  Thou see'st yon shrine thou know'st what fugitives  Its sanctuary shelters and the hate  The mortal hate Eurystheus bears their race  But chiefly bears Macaria from whose loins  Another race more hateful may come forth  Canst thou not thenWhy do thy fearful eyes  So cautiously shun mineCanst thou not then  Call down a voice oracular from heaven  That claims a victimthat Macaria claims  I know thou canst and far be't from Alcander  To question his friend's will  Thes  Is this thy friendship  The token this of thy high veneration  For Thestor's character whose heart long since  From this vain world estranged  Alcan  Old manbut yet  Calmly I'll commune with thee I'll convince  Thy scrupulous spirit that her single death  Will save the lives of thousands which a war  With Argos must devote  Thes  The lives of thousands  Lie on their consciences who wage the war  Shall Thestor's hands be stain'd with guiltless blood  Shall Thestor's tongue belye the temple's god  With a false oracle his thunders brave  Th' engendering storm already  Alcan  These nice qualms  These conscientious horrors were they wont  To stagger ThestorWants the seer more warrant  To be oracular Go then consult  The entrails of your beasts your babbling birds  And groaning oaks or single forth some goat  Yeaned at full moon and kill him with a knife  Of that be sure exactly shaped and sized  This shall disarm your god of his red bolt  And make your murders holy  Thes  Such loud passion  Affronting to the god  Alcan  Are you not all  Priestess and priest alike the supple slaves  Of interest Whence your tripods and your crowns  Statues of gold and silver glittering gems  That sanctify your shrines Whence this vast splendour  And what but the rich bribes of crafty knaves  And superstitious cowardsOne word more  Of hypocritic mummery and by heaven  I will unfold such scenes  Thes  Ungenerous man  Whose headlong phrenzy on my least demur  Unmindful of all forms all ceremonies  Of all past benefits temple and priest  Would overturn  Alcan  Why then the infirmity  Of thy friend's temper urge to the extreme  Upon a point so trying  Thes  Hah and is  The point to me less tryinggrant it just  And sad necessity makes most things just  Yet to pronounce a sacrifice at once  Shed without hesitation royal blood  No reverence had to my own fame no care  For my own life and every worldly hope  Alcan  Thy fame thy life if there be confidence  In a king's word in friendship like Alcander's  Shall be secure thy every worldly hope  To the minutest scruple warranted  And now how softened seems that countenance  Which speaks without a tongue my friend's assent  Speaks him again my ancient honour'd Thestor  Here then behold th' instructions take them read them  And with them take this pledge Eurystheus sends it  This gem from his own finger Now dispatch  Pronounce the oracle be firm and prosper  Exit  Thestor  Now fate begins its workI have already  Alarmed the timorous temper of the king  About these fugitivesBut he approaches  Here to perform a superstitious vow  He made before his march to Marathon  Enter DEMOPHON and his train  Demo  How venerable the horror that enfolds  Jove's holy temple with profoundest awe  Behold thy servant enters  Alcan  May its god  Inspire thy righteous spirit so to act  As best becomes his servant This remember  The hand the chastening hand of heaven lies on  These exiles and each shrine save this oh king  Against them shut as against things unholy  How desperate then to risk for them a war  Demo  Thy doubts already have found entrance here  Therefore to know heaven's purpose I have sent  The most inspired of all th' oracular priests  Our ancient Thestor without whose sage voice  In holy things we move not  Alcan  To his voice  As is most fit I bow me Yet hear further  What never oracle more truly spoke  Your brother's dangerous spirit every hour  More dangerous by Macaria's matchless charms  Forgive my forward friendshipbut behold  Graced with the royal ensigns where he comes  Exulting on in burnished armour clad  As he were Athens' king and peace and war  Hung on his nodI must not stay to cross  The army's idol  Exit  Enter ACAMAS  Aca  Back to Athens welcome  My royal brother  Demo  When we went from Athens  In peaceful garb was Acamas arrayed  The soldier's falchion now invests his thigh  The sun now glitters on his polished helm  And clanking arms and armour sound to war  Aca  And if war e'er was just and heaven approved  'Tis now when Deianira and Macaria  By a vile tyrant exiled suppliants come  To thee and to the God whom thy religion  Doth venerate in that shrine which scarce protects them  From the brute outrage of a haughty herald  I heard Macaria plead and tears burst forth  Alcander spoke and at each ruffian word  My indignation burned To hesitate  In such a cause were guilt  Demo  Thy passion speaks this  The glittering glory of rash enterprize  Fires thy transported spirit that would flame  The meteor of a multitude's amaze  No thought beyond the present hour unmindful  Of a king's duty that the royal sword  Should save not sacrifice a people's lives  And then be sheath'd when it has fixt the base  Of future happiness that each exploit  Weigh'd and digested deep must be consign'd  In history's long roll to times unborn  And stand their rigid test  Aca  Such then such is  Th' occasion this important hour presents  Stamp this exploit in history's long roll  To stand the rigid test of times unborn  Rouze then at once insulted virtue cries  Rouze and revengethe troops are marshalledI  Will march my veterans  Demo  Heedless of th' event  By heavenly admonition unassured  What would thy frantic fury  Aca  It would hurl  Yon ruthless ruffian headlong from the throne  Of Argos and restore its rightful heirs  Restore Alcides' royal racei'th' presence  Of Jove's dreadful sanctuary I've given my word  Irrevocable  Demo  To embroil my kingdom  In civil factions well as foreign war  Art thou to learn what spirits there are stirring  By their own vices ruin'd bold seditious  Desperate of what may happen without hope  But from the general wreckthese are at work  All ready like the pentup pestilence  To burst upon us  Aca  Oh ignoble fear  Bane of all worth which every sacred tye  The splendor of th' Athenian name its glory  Would basely trample down Shall then this state  Famed for its love of freedom thro' the world  And love of mercyhah shall generous Athens  Crouch to Eurystheus to an Argian tyrant  Its royal suppliants yieldMy brother no  They shall not quit the temple  Demo  Shall not quit  Presumest thou with these fantastic flights  Romantic visions of a lovesick boy  To fright us to compliance  Aca  Lovesick boy  Demo  That was my wordMacaria does the name  Flush with a crimson shame thy conscious cheek  The loves that revel in Macaria's eyes  These are the orators that plead for war  And these the generous virtues that would risk  A kingdom's ruin  Aca  Well Macaria then  Sounds the alarm for war her filial sighs  The wrongs of weeping beauty that might move  The world to arms move meI own the charge  I triumph in the weaknesscheck thy scorn  Cast on thy slave not me that menacing frown  Proud king for I will speak when justice bids  Tho' death his dart shook at meWith these suppliants  My honour is at stake dear as that honour  I hold and will protect them tho' Alcander  Had every wile of every fiendremember  For by the soul of my dread sire the sword  To them shall pass thro' me  Enter MACARIA  Mac  Did I not hear  A voice like that of Acamas or was it  My fancy's coinagehah  Demo  What sudden blaze  Of beauty breaks upon me from the temple  By heaven 'tis she the syren that seduc'd  My brother and no wonder for her eyes  Have witchcraft in them and each lovely look  A melancholy grace that melts the soul  Art thou Macaria  Mac  The distrest Macaria  Daughter of Deianira and with her  Hither from Argos by Eurystheus driven  Where Acamasmay heaven reward his virtue  Saw and supported us Canst thou inform me  Of my protector  Demo  Hence this moment lady  My brother went  Mac  And art thou Demophon  His brother whom we owe a life of thanks  Oh Sir to him to you with gratitude  As low as to our guardian gods we bend  For our late blessing Like a chearful morn  Fair opening on a dark and dismal night  The gracious tidings came they lifted up  The lamp of life just fading in her eye  And gave to a despairing daughter's heart  A happy mother  Demo  In this changeful scene  No mortal creature till the hour of fate  May be called happy  Mac  Yet might I entreat you  To cast one casual glanceadmire the work  Of your own goodnessheavenshow changed from her  Who lately on the ground on the cold ground  Lay hopeless almost liselessWith the sight  Of her good genius bless her  Demo  Much Macaria  I fear o'errates th' indulgence Demophon  May yield to Deianira  Mac  How such friendship  Fills me with wonder but a virtuous heart  Is happy in the happiness it gives  Enter the shrine and bless her with thy presence  Enter IOLAUS  Iol  Joy to Macaria if 'tis joy to hear  Hyllus has scaped the tyrant's treacherous wiles  T' ensnare his honoured life  Mac  Blest be the tongue  That speaks the tidings Come my Hyllus come  Ready to fold thee to his friendly breast  Stands Acamas and Demophon will join  His godlike brother Oh we're blest indeed  Son mother daughter blest in two such friends  Solemn Music Enter THESTOR and Priests  Thes  Pause ye my reverend brethren Let no thought  Illomen'd look or word this place profane  With solemn silence all ye priests of heaven  Attend Brief are the words and terrible  Of the dread oracle  Mac  What oracle  Thes  No interruption maid At thy command  Oh king did we proclaim a sacrifice  Wrapt in celestial musings then approached  These reverend sages and with solemn voice  Chaunted their holiest hymn the shrines burnt bright  With sacred fires and every altar sent  Its swelling incense on a hallowed cloud  To him on high  Mac  This dreadful preparation  Thes  When thus burst forth the awful voice"No steer  "No blood of bulls will now propitiate heaven  "To grant success Would Athens stand secure  "Would Hyllus save his royal father's throne  "And his own lifeThe blood of Deianira  Mac  Horror of horrorsDeianira's blood  Thes  The priest of Jove with pitying eye beholds  Thy suffering soul But hear the oracle  "Would Hyllus save his royal father's throne  "And his own life the blood of Deianira  "Must in a purple stream of sacrifice  "Float on the sacred altar of the god"  Iol  She faints ah gently lend your aid    Macaria  faints  Demo  How lovely  Even when the hand of death lies cold upon her  Mac  I live I yet survive the dreadful sounds  Still thunder in my earsmy mother's blood  Tell me tremendous god what unknown crime  Provokes such vengeance Why is it decreed  That the whole race of Hercules must feel  Thy horrible displeasure  Thes  Ah presume not  Rash virgin heavenly wisdom to arraign  Just is the god tho' terrible his will  Must be obeyed But that thy soul would sink  At the tremendous sounds should'st thou hear all  For yet the oracle's but half declared  Mac  But half declared  Thes  "The blood of Deianira  "Must in a purple stream of sacrifice  "Float on the sacred altar of the god  "Unless with free and voluntary choice  "Alcides' daughter here devotes her own"  Mac  Thanks gracious powers thanks from her inmost soul  That daughter offersLet her brother reign  Spare her loved mother's life and lo Macaria  With tears of transport here devotes her own  Lead to the altar crown with garlands crown  Your victim and be conquerors  Demo  What is this  That pleads for her so plaintively a pity  That's almost painful Wherefore in the bloom  Of youth should such unblemish'd

with a Coronet attended by Officers  Hyl  Give me way  Oh I come not too late Macaria lives  And Deianira lives  Deia  My conqueror  Mac  My Hyllus  Iol  My loved master  Demo  But alas  Thy garmentah thy garment smeared with blood  Hyl  It is Eurystheus' blood I slew the tyrant  And here his regal coronet present  A trophy to my mother All his troops  Who hated as they feared him dropt their arms  When they beheld my falchion in his breast  And hailed the son of Hercules their king  Deia  Transporting sounds to Deianira's ears  Who mourned her son a victim to th' assassin  Sent by the villain who lies breathless there  Slain by that prince's hand  Hyl  The ruffian met  A fate too honourable but he's dead  And with him die resentment  Demo  Generous prince  Whose nobleness of mind with wonder strikes me  With wonder and with shame Yes I have been  Too credulous My crime before me stands  A dreadful warning ne'er with human blood  To stain religion's altars  Hyl  From this moment  We are firm friends and now 'tis double joy  With my own hand to have preserved your son  But oh my more than friend my Acamas  How shall my full heart pay th' eternal debt  That gratitude owes thee  Aca  Macaria lives  I saved Macaria's life I'm more than paid  Deia  Not till she hath enrich'd thee with herself  Take then protector of her life and mine  From a fond mother's hand that freely gives  Oh take the daughter of my soul  Hyl  A maid  Forgive a brother's boast unparalleled  In every virtuous grace A gem she is  Brighter than glitters in the diadem  Thou placest on my brow Take her she's thine  And thus united share with me my throne  Thy friendship's noble gift  Deia  God of our fathers  Who from th' abyss of misery in a moment  Up to a heaven of happiness canst lift  Poor mortals what a change incredible  Hath this day wroughtthe rude repinings pardon  Of a rash woman questioning thy just  Thy fatherly corrections which dissolve  When the sharp season of probation's past  Like fostering dews in mercies on mankind  Exeunt  END OF THE FIFTH ACT  EPILOGUE  Written by a FRIEND  WELL these heroic timesI scarce can speak  These ancient fables borrow'd from the Greek  Are all so full of passion rage and death  So violentthey take away one's breath  Let me recover praythis tragic strife  Night after nightleads me a weary life  Thro' what variety of folks long dead  Through what strange times and beings are we led  Now a fond daughter trembling for her sire  Now Phaedra burning with unlawful fire  A heroine now for Greece my brain I rack  Now Desdemona smother'd by a Black  To take these various shapes and fill the whole  An actress needs a transmigrating soul  This night you'll own I've had full cause to mourn  A chief renown'd from my embraces torn  Well might a widow weep the best of men  Oh such a husband I shan't have again  With bright renown he fill'd the Eastern climes  And differ'd ladies from these modern times  In life's first dawn to deeds of terror bred  The youthful hero crush'd the serpent's head  In these our days when men their object miss  There are who like to hear the serpent hiss  One thing there is which I must not disguise  Tho' brave heroic generous and wise  The lover tam'd aside his club could throw  Chain'd to the distaff like a modern beau  Yet all his toils and all his labours past  By death ev'n Envy was subdued at last  We read so says our bard in Ovid's stile  How for himself he rais'd the funeral pile  There on his club reclininglike a guest  With garlands crown'dhe sunk to endless rest  Yet even now in these degenerate days  Heroic virtue still can merit praise  When round the ship in the deep roaring tide  Devouring flames advance on ev'ry side  Lo on the anchor where the hero lies  With look serene and still the foe defies  He views the flame he views the brawling wave  Then sinksundaunted sinks in glory's grave  May his example every breast inspire  And kindle thro' the land our antient fire  For noughtas Shakespeare sings "can make us rue  "If Britain to herself will prove but true"  THE END
