be∣longed to the late Duchess of Portland by whose permission Mr Pennant described it in the British Zoology This author has given two figures of it one in Plate and the other in the Frontispiece of the fourth volume  The existence of this species being only proved by a solitary speci∣men various conjectures have arisen amongst Conchologists respecting it Some have been inclined to admit it as an undoubted species and others as a mere accidental variety of growth of the Linnaean Murex Antiquus How far we may be authorized to abide by the former opinion must rest with the critical Naturalist  To argue that it cannot be a distinct species because only one shell of the kind has been hitherto found is absurd since the ex∣istence of many other species has been asserted upon the evidence of a single specimen only and its relation to Murex antiquus is not so obvious as might he at first imagined It certainly approaches it in the general outline but the tidges of Murex Antiquus is most com∣pletely raised into tubercules whereas those of Carinatus are per∣fectly smooth and even nor is there that strict correspondence in the angulations of the contour in general that should induce us to consider it a variety of Murex Carinatus  In deciding a question of some moment to the English Concho∣logist it has been thought advisable to give an additional Plate of Murex Antiquus by which the difference between the two shells may be more easily discriminated We must however observe that the latter is not absolutely known as a British shell it is a native of the North Seas and has been supposed to inhabit some of the remote northern islands of the British dominions The Murex Antiquus of Pennant is a very different shell and by no means allied to that of Linnaeus whose name it bears  It is now uncertain from what part of our coast the Duchess of Portland received this shell Pennant is silent in this respect but we cannot dispute that her Grace received it as a British shell since it was inserted upon her authority in the British Zoology  PLATE CX SOLEN MARGINATUS  MARGINATED RAZOR SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER  Bivalve with equal valves oblong open at both ends At the hinge a

but it is more probable that he had never met with it or the character of the teeth at the hinge could not have escaped his notice In its general appearance it is not un∣like Solen Siliqua but has one end marginated and only a single  tooth in each valve on the contrary Solen Siliqua has two teeth in one valve and one in the other the single one being inserted be∣tween the two others when the shell is shut  This is very scarce Pennant says it inhabits Red Wharf Anglesea This is not Solen Vagina of Linnaeus as Pennant describes it  PLATE CXI TROCHUS TERRESTRIS  LAND TOP SHELL  GENERIC CHARACTER

Lister had not seen any of them alive and concludes it must be a pelagian shell or one of those which live far from the shores  As Pennant had inserted this species in his  British Zoology  upon this authority Da Costa was unwilling to omit it in his  British Conchology  yet he observes that it is not improbable Dr Lister was imposed upon by the fishermen for the shell is generally believed to be a native of the East Indies some consider it as a WestIndian and others as an European species  PLATE CXIII MYTILUS ANATINUS  SMALL HORSE MUSCLE  GENERIC CHARACTER  The hinge toothless and consists of

shores of Dorset∣shire and Hampshire  Pennant has mistaken this for a very distinct shell described by Linnaeus under the name of Solen Cultellus  PLATE CXV VENUS CANCELLATA  MEMBRANACEOUS VENUS

of Europe  PLATE CXX  FIG I BULLA APERTA  OPEN BULLA OR BUBBLE  GENERIC CHARACTER  Shell suboval Aperture oblong very patulous and smooth or even One end convoluted  SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS

Bulla pellucida fragilissima tota hians s apertura amplissima  Da Costa Brit Conch p    sp    Da Costa says all the shells of this species he knew were fished up near Weymouth in Dorsetshire and not any where else on the British coast they are even not frequent there so that it seems a rare as well as curious shellTo this we may add that they are  rare only because they are local in one part of the sandy bay of Caermarthen below Tenby we found them in abundance  It is called "the Bubble" by this writer who observes that it exactly resembles a bubble or bladder of water The aperture is so extremely large that the whole shell lies open to view The contour is somewhat oval and slightly involuted and the shell is not umbilicated  This is certainly not Bulla patula of Pennant Brit Zool No A as Da Costa and Gmelin imagine The figures in that work are sometimes calculated to mislead the most attentive but as we are in possession of the shell Pennant describes we can venture to say the two former writers are mistaken The species Aperta was unknown to Pennant and the shell he figured from the Portland Cabinet under the specific name of Patula is extremely rare  FIG II BULLA CYLINDRICA  NARROW BULLA  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Shell cylindric smooth white and thin  BULLA CYLINDRICA testa cylindrica laevi alba tenuissima  Gmel T    p    p    sp    This is a very scarce species on our coasts and approaches so nearly to Bulla pallida of Da Costa Voluta pallida  Linn  described and figured in Plate LXVI of this Work that it may easily be confounded with it unless the two shells be compared Bulla Cylindrica differs in being rather more compressed and has the pillar∣lip perfectly smooth while on the contrary the other has plaits or wrinkles upon this part as before observed a circumstance that constitutes one character of the Voluta genus in the system of Linnaeus  In the description of the Voluta pallida we were led to think with Da Costa that the shell figured by Pennant in the British Zoology No A might be of the same species Since that time we have been favoured with the specimen figured in the annexed Plate and as it seems to correspond more clearly with Pennant's shell than the other there can be no impropriety in removing the reference from the former to the present species Gmelin takes not the slightest notice of this figure of Pennant so that we must remain ignorant of his opinion respecting it And it is certain the shell before us was altogether unknown to Da Costa  PLATE CXXI VENUS UNDATA  WAVED VENUS  GENERIC CHARACTER  Bivalve Hinge furnished with three teeth two near each other the third divergent from the beaks  SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS  Shell orbiculated convex thin transversely marked with very fine striae and waved at the margin

with thin concentric  striae  waved at the edges  Penn Brit Zool    sp    There can be no doubt that the shell figured and described by Pennant in the fourth volume of his British Zoology  No  is of  the same species as our shell That author says it is the size of a hazel nut from which it appears the specimen he saw was a young Shell the largest of our specimens being of the size represented in the annexed Plate  This is  Venus lactea  of some cabinets a name sufficiently ex∣pressive of its colour but having been before called  Undata  by Pennant we thought it best to retain the name he had given it  PLATE CXXII MYA OVATA  OVATE MYA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal an ascidia Shell bivalve gaping at one end The hinge for the most part furnished with a thick strong and broad tooth not inserted in the opposite valve  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Shell oblongovate posterior part roundish and very slightly gaping first tooth at the hinge crenulated  MYA OVATA testa oblongeovata postice rotundata vix hiante car∣dinis dente primario crenulato  This is the Shell alluded to in the description of Plate under the name of Mya ovata The difference between it and Mya depressa as before observed seems to consist in the present being more ovate and not depressed across the middle nor is the gaping at the broadest end so considerable as in the other  These we have already remarked inhabit the same waters as Mya depressa viz in the New River near London and the Froome in  Somersetshire It is a thick strong and heavy Shell of a greenish colour and radiatedThe smallest figure in the annexed plate is a brown coloured specimen of Mya depressa  PLATE CXXIII TELLINA INAEQUISTRIATA  UNEQUALLYSTRIATED TELLEN  GENERIC CHARACTER  The hinge usually furnished with three teeth Shell generally sloping on one side  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Shell ovate compressed and rather flattish rosy very finely striated transversely the striae fewer and larger at the anterior end  TELLINA INAEQUISTRIATA testa ovata compressoplaniuscula rosea subtilissime transversim striata striis anterius paucioribus majoribusque  A very rare species of Tellina communicated to Da Costa after his Conchology was published and therefore not noticed in that work It has been found by the late Dr Pulteney we believe on the coast of Dorsetshire  PLATE CXXIV  FIG I ARDIUM EDULE  COMMON COCKLE  GENERIC CHARACTER  Two teeth near

These Shells vary a little both in shape and colour the two spe∣cimens figured on the annexed Plate differ one being more orbicular than the other They are generally whitish sometimes they have a blueish and sometimes a yellowish tint  FIG II CARDIUM RUSTICUM  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Shell antiquated with about twenty remote grooves the interstices rugged  CARDIUM RUSTICUM testa antiquata sulcis viginti remotis in∣terstitiis rugosis  Gmelin T    p    p    sp    Notwithstanding the endless variations to which the shells of the common Cockle are liable this appears too remote to be admitted as one of them It passes for Cardium rusticum with some concholo∣gists and though it may not strictly agree with that specific descrip∣tion of Gmelin it approaches nearer to it than to edule That author  notices the affinity  rusticum  bears to the other species but observes that the grooves are deeper and the ribs fewer and more convex in rusticum he remarks also that the latter has a ridge on the anterior margin when the valves are closed and a narrow depressure behind the beaks "ano evidente sed angusto" which is not in the other The grooves in our Shell are not so deep as "sulcis profundioribus" implies but they are both deeper and wider than in the common sort the ribs are rather more convex also fewer in number and rugged as Gmelin describes itThe colour exactly corresponds he says it is sometimes ferruginous with livid bands and sometimes white with the anterior part fuscous another variety of it is white fasciated with a ferruginous yellowish or blueish colour  PLATE CXXV MACTRA GLAUCA  GLAUCOUS MACTRA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal a Tethys Bivalve sides unequal Middle tooth compli∣cated with a little groove on each side lateral teeth remote  SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND

on our coast The attention with which this lady has honoured the science has not been rewarded by this new species only we have been favoured with several others besides many rare kinds that have been found by  her on different parts of the seacoast and especially on that of Cornwall as will appear hereafter A few shells of the species before us were met with by her in the summer of on Hale sands under Lelant in that county and it is said by the country people they are at times found on that coast in some plenty  Though hitherto unknown as a British shell it has been before discovered in the Mediterranean sea for there can be no hesitation in admitting it to be the shell figured by Chemnitz as above quoted Gmelin refers to the two figures in that Work No and for his species glauca and the description corresponds in general with them though not exactly in the colour of the raysGmelin has another species of Mactra  grandis  which we at first suspected to be the same as our shell It agrees precisely in the colour of the rays but from the figure in Chemnitz's work quoted by Gmelin for that species these rays it appears are far more minute than in our shell and are also decussated by others in a concentric direction the outline of the latter is also different  PLATE CXXVI MACTRA SUBTRUNCTA  SUBTRUNCATED MACTRA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Animal a Tethys Bivalve sides unequal Middle

quantity of others natives of that coast by an intelligent gentleman of veracity and curiosity but" adds that  writer "must own I have never met with this species since on any other British coasts" We have since seen it among parcels of shells from the Mediterranean and also find that it has been discovered by the late Dr Pultney on the North shore Poole and at Weymouth  The specific character of the Gmelinian Trochus  Granatum  seems to accord very nearly with our shell  Testa pyramidali alba coccineo varia basi subconvexa spirae anfractibus convexis  ingulis granorum moniformibus primis duobus maximis  Gmel    sp    but it is about twice the size and inhabits the Southern Ocean and it is certainly more pro∣bable as some conchologists have suggested that it is the  variety  of Trochus Zizyphinus described by Linnaeus in the  Mus Reginae  as being "tota pallida anfractibus basi gibbis striatis subtitissime punctis papilloris" It differs from Zizyphinus in having the anfrac∣tus a little rounded and the wreaths being encircled with granulated spiral ridges The name Da Costa has already given it is very ap∣plicable and as it has undoubtedly escaped the notice of Gmelin there can be no impropriety in retaining itIt is evidently one of the rarest British species of the Trochus genus  PLATE CXXVIII  FIG II MYTILUS EDULIS  COMMON MUSCLE  GENERIC CHARACTER  The hinge toothless and

edulis and few indeed exhibit such an infinite number of varieties differing in size in form and colour but which the critical Conchologist will yet perceive cannot with propriety be assigned to any other species  On the Plate annexed to this description one shell of the shape more uniformly prevalent is figured in its natural state and another which having been divested of the epidermis displays a beautiful variety of irregular purple stripes an appearance very common in the uncoated shells and in some sorts observable even when the epi∣dermis is upon them The upper and lower figures are of two shells which we are inclined to think differ too widely from the common kind to be considered as a variety the outline appears at the first sight obviously dissimilar and the characters in general seem to mark most decidedly another species They are both worn shells but which we have compared with perfect specimens of My∣tilus ungulatus and apprehend there can be no doubt that they belong to that species  Within the tropics the common Muscle is known to attain a much larger size than in northern climates They are found in im∣mense beds and adhere to other substances or to one another by means of a beard of a strong and silky texture which the fish throws out The Muscle affords a rich and palatable food though they are not deemed wholesome by many people who after eating them are sometimes afflicted with great swellings and convulsive motions with eruptive blotches shortness of breath and even with delirium These dreadful effects are usually attributed to some malignant poison in the little pea crab which is occasionally found in the Muscle and  may be accidentally eaten with it others think it is in consequence of swallowing the silky byssus or beard and again many deem the Muscle itself poisonous It is however pretty generally agreed that they affect some constitutions more than others and that much depends on the state of the body at the time of eating them The disorder may be cured or at least its malignity mitigated by ad∣ministering to the affected person a spoonful of vinegar some re∣commend sweet oil or salt and water Da Costa observes that su∣dorifics vomits oils c are the usual remedies and the Dutch give two spoon'sfull of oil and one of lemonjuice or in defect of that a little more vinegar well shaken together and swallowed immediately  The Muscle is the prey of many kinds of fishes and other crea∣tures that inhabit the sea On the coast of Greenland Fabricius tell us they are so abundant that the dogs and ravens commonly feed on them as do also the white game Ptarmigan Eider Duck and many others  The seedpearls found in the shell of the Muscle was formerly in some esteem for medicinal purposes these it is well known are the effects of a disease in the fish unalogous to the stone in the human body  Mr Pennant informs us that the finest Muscles on the English coasts where they are found in great abundance are those called Hambleton Hookers from a village in the county of Lancashire They are taken out of the sea and placed in the river Wier within reach of the tide where they grow very fat and delicious  FIG II II

more generally inhabits the southern parts of Europe is larger and whiter than hortensis and the lip is brown  This is a most variable species in its colours and markings and it may still be doubted whether hortensis and lucorum be perfectly distinct They have certainly been confounded by almost every Conchologist  On the manners of a creature which is so generally known as the Common Garden Snail it is surely needless to enlarge its mode of courtship is however so curiously related that it should not en∣tirely escape remark and were it not attested by writers of the first authority with the reader we might be guilty of no small degree of scepticism as to believing it Each of these animals it seems are furnished at a certain season with a number of little pointed darts which are contained within a cavity on the right side of the neck When the Snails approach within two or three inches of each other a scene of hostility is observed to com∣mence each discharging at its

Sabella granulata of Linnaeus and not having observed the same character in any of those shells that have occurred to notice on our own coasts have thought it most adviseable to retain the name Mr Pennant had previously given it  Gmelin seems to be under some doubts respecting this shell for he entirely omits the Linnaean  granulata  among the species of this genusSabella Belgica of Gmelin

Da Costa Brit Conch p    sp    ARCA CRINITA  Soland Mus Portland Puliney Nat Hist Dorsets  There does certainly exist among conchologists a strange dis∣cordance of opinion respecting the species of Arca before us some believing it to be the very shell which Linnaeus described under the name of  lactea  and others maintaining the contrary Dr Solander and Dr Pultney were persuaded that Linnaeus intended a shell in some particulars not unlike this but specifically different the same shell in fact which Lister figures No in his Conchology The opinions of two such respectable naturalists deserve every considera∣tion but however we may be disposed to abide by their authority in some instances we cannot for the following reasons assent to it in the present  Dr Pultney premises his description by naming this species Arca crinita a name which it appears Dr Solander had previously given to it in his catalogue of the Portland Museum he observes very justly that it is the  A barbata  of Pennant but not the barbata of Linnaeus refers to Da Costa's figure Plate fig and calls it in English the HAIRY ARKSHELL His description is in these words "A small oblong subrhomboidal shell in its recent state covered with a brown epidermis Undemeath the shell is minutely striated in the longitudinal direction commonly not much larger than a horsebean I found one on the North shore at Poole more than half an inch long and seveneights wide It is said to be more frequent on the shores of Guernsey island but is very rare on  our coasts This shell has commonly been described as the  A lactea  of Linnaeus but that shell is much larger and is strongly striated in a reticulated manner"  In the first place this does not so clearly agree with the Linnaean description as might be expected In the early editions of the  Systema Naturae  Linnaeus expressly describes his shell as being of a sub∣rhombic form with obsolete decussating striae diaphanous with re∣curved beaks and crenulated margin and the only alteration in the specific character to the last edition of that work by  Gmelin  is that the beaks and margins are not mentioned It hence is evident that Dr Pultney is mistaken in the Linnaean  lactea  when he says it is  strongly striated  in a reticulated manner for Linnaeus exactly de∣scribes it as having the reticulating striae  obsolete  and notwith∣standing that the longitudinal striae in the shell found on our coast are rather prominent in some specimens they far more frequently appear altogether obsolete and are decussated by fine transverse striae precisely as Linnaeus mentions There is another circumstance equally remarkable Linnaeus exactly tells us his  lactea  is the size of a horsebean and Dr Pultney after observing that his British shell  crinita  "are commonly not much larger than a horsebean" adds that the  lactea  of Linnaeus is "much larger"  That there may have been some erroneous references among authors to the two shells figured by Lister No and of which we are not aware is not impossible but  Gmelin  refers to  List Conch    A T Guernsey  for the Linnaean  lactea  and that shell clearly corresponds both with our specimen and the shell described by Linnaeus pectunculus exiguus albus admodum tenuiter striatis  ListPetiver  is equally satisfactory Mytilus Garnseiae  albus parvus tenuiter cancellata Da Costa is not so very clear nor is his figure expressive because it represents the transverse ridges too prominent Chemnitz gives a larger specimen of it than any we have seen and notwithstanding his references to Da Costa and others may not be of the same speciesThe shell figured by Lister No which seems to have occasioned the confusion before alluded to it should be observed is described by Gmelin in these words testa subrhomboidea decussatim striata alba natibus approxi∣matis vulva cordata  Arca reticulata  Hence it is presumed the shell found on our coast ought still to be considered as the  Arca lactea  of Linnaeus and that the shell which is strongly striated in a reticulated manner and so much larger and has been hitherto regarded by some as that species was never described or even noticed by Linnaeus Nothing can be more evident than that this is the opinion of his editor Gmelin both from his references to the figures of lactea and by his giving a new name and character to that very shell in Lister which has been mistaken for it and which he conceived Linnaeus had omitted  This kind is generally considered as an inhabitant of Dorsetshire Devonshire and Cornwall  PLATE CXXXVI HELIX ARBUSTORUM

evidently a Volute and the third plait which with the two others characterize the species is obviously too large to have been overlooked Da Costa we are persuaded though they were both the same for in a  MS note  attached to this shell in his collec∣tion he says "This shell is figured by Walker" and certainly no figure in the volume of that Author corresponds with it except that to which we refer

of the tide at high water and although it is composed entirely of broken shells and sea sand and those apparently very slightly agglutinated by the ani∣mals that form and inhabit it in its native element it acquires a con∣siderable comparative degree of tenacity from the saline particles with which it is impregnated and is capable of resisting the reiterated dashing of the waves without material injury  In the more sheltered crevices of the rocks where the animal has ample scope to expand its sandy dwelling secure from mutilation the upper surface of a mass of these shells has a very elegant appearance the whole being beautifully foliated with the single or bipartite funnnel shaped lip which each animal forms at the opening of his cell This appearance is represented in the plate subjoined and is a circumstance the more deserving attention because it has entirely escaped the notice of Mr Pennant and perhaps of every other Naturalist except Mr Ellis who in his History of Corals figures it with a foliated surface under the title of Tubularia arenosa anglica from a specimen brought from Dieppe The latter does not however agree precisely in figure with any that have occurred to our notice Mr Pennant evidently represents a poor mutilated fragment in which the openings of the cells are shewn like so many rounded perforations in a somewhat uneven sur∣face and is just as it appears in masses on the seabeach that have been trodden underfoot or pieces that have been much worn and thrown loose upon the shore  These shells are three or four inches in length and where they are found are generally abundant but they seem to be very local Mr Pennant says it is found on the Western coasts of Anglesea near Cric∣ceth  in Caernarvonshire and near Yarmouth We have seen it on other parts of the sea coast of North Wales and in equal plenty on those of South Wales likewise On the coast of Dorsetshire according to Dr Pultney fragments are found very frequently but none very perfect In the History of that County the following ac∣count is given of it"GREGARIOUS SABELLA This is composed of a mass of fine sand and particles of broken and finely comminuted shells aggregated
