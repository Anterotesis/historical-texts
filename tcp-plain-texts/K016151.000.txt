 THE Fatal Extravagance A TRAGEDY As it is Acted at the THEATRE in  Lincoln'sInnFields  Written by Mr JOSEPH MITCHELL  LONDON Printed for T JAUNCY at the  Angel  without  TempleBar  Price One Shilling  TO THE Most Noble PRINCE JAMES Duke HAMILTON Duke of BRANDON  c  May it please Your Grace  _WHEN I reflect on your Dignity as First Peer of  Scotland  the oldest Monarchy of  Europe  I address you with Dread And consider my own Ambition of throwing my self and my first Essay in Tragedy under the Protection of your Illustrious  Name as a Presumption which no Apology can excuse unless I seek it in your Goodness  But 'tis both natural and necessary for Poets to court the Favour of the Great And the Honour which your Grace's Indulgence vouchsafes me on this Occasion distinguishes you no less among the Patrons of the  Muses  than your high Birth among the Noble for the smaller my Merit may be judged by the World the more glorious that Humanity which excites your Grace to encourage it till 'tis encreas'd by your Influence Many a Slip might have grown to a tall Cedar if it had been pal'd round and water'd instead of being trampled upon The most invisible Spark may be gradualy blown to an illuminating Blaze and give Delight to its Nourisher  How bless'd should I conceive my self might I ever become worthy this  Regard of a Patron the very Dawn of whose Life is breaking out upon the World with a stronger Lustre from his Merit than it receiv'd from his State  I snatch'd this Opportunity to acknowledge my Devotion to your Grace's Name and Family and to stand out the first publick Predictor that your innate Princely Qualities will render you of more Consequence to your Country than the splendid Advantages of your Title and great Power  So glorious a Conjunction of happy Circumstances must be the Blessing of your Grace's own Life the Honour and good Fortune of your Friends and Dependants and the universal Admiration of the Country that lays Claim to you A Country which I am sure you will adorn by your Councils and your Actions after a Manner which has never yet been reach'd  even by the Brave and Illustrious long Line of your Predecessors  May the kindest Care of Heaven preserve your important Life from all Dangers and ill Accidents to be the Ornament of your own Age and the great Example and Emulation of Posterity  I am with the profoundest Duty and Respect  May it please your Grace  Your Grace's most Obedient and most Devoted Humble Servant JOSEPH MITCHELL  THE PREFACE  _THERE are few Men of Learning except some of my own Country misled by a Zeal both indiscreet and unwarrantable who do not readily acknowledge  POETRY  to be the Daughter of Religion and originally design'd to tune Men's Minds to Devotion This is evident from the many noble Poems in the  Old Testament  to say Nothing of other Writings But the primitive Simplicity becoming gradually lost as the Art was apply'd to Ends unworthy its Institution the Reformers were obliged to take Advantage of Mens Passions by giving it a new Turn which under the Temptation of Delight disguis'd the Doctrine they recommended  TRAGEDY  in particular was the Perfection of the  Muse's  Power Till  that  became known there was wanting a kind of Poetry which imitating the Actions of Mankind might work a readier and more sensible Effect by a Corvection of the Passions The Prevalence of Vice 'tis true and Men's natural Propensity to resist good Instruction allow'd not a Success to  TRAGIDY  so universal as it merited But since no better Help than  this  can be devis'd the Friends of Vertue and Genius must use the means it affords them  In Countries where  CHRISTIANITY  is receiv'd and established some may possibly imagine there is now no longer Need of the Assistance of  TRAGEDY  But Experience convinces us That many frequent the  STAGE  who would hardly be prevailed upon to receive Counsel from the  PULPIT  The  CLERGY  therefore should consider as Auxiliaries and FellowLabourers those  POETS  who preach Vertue from the  Press  or the  Theatre  And since we seek not a Share of  their  Revenues for the Pains we take in their Service they ought at least in Civility to allow us their Countenance and Acknowledgement Is there a Kirkman among my Adversaries whose Zeal is so militant as to fight without Wages Why then am I condemn'd who more generously go to War in a Way they could not take themselves were they hindred from fighting against Vice from the Pulpit Who is so rude as to blame an honest  Volunteer  in a good Cause Or if one deserves to be a  Commander in Chief  Why is he grudged Preferment beyond the List and Rate of an  HalfPayOfficer  But some who are moderate because more wise than  those  I have had to do with confess the  STAGE capable  of being made  useful  yet condemn it on Account of the  Abuses  it indulgesWould they destroy the  Being  of an Art because its Use is corrupted They argue like those Zealous indeed but  weak  Reformers who were for demolishing Churches that they might be sure to leave no Images According  to these Mens Way of Reasoning every Thing that is not perfect is dangerous and abominable for there is nothing so excellent where Abuses may not enter  Preaching  thÃªy know well is often  abused  will they allow me therefore to cry out That all  Preaching  is  unlawful  I writ the following short  TRAGEDY  to give my Countrymen of the Kirk an Example that sound and useful Instruction may be drawn from the  Theatre  and that only the Abuse is blameable I might indeed have referred my overrigid Adversaries to other Pieces of  Dramatic POETRY  already extant But some Peculiarities in my Case which the World is likely to know more of very soon obliged me to give a Specimen my self of a Play wherein nothing justly can be condemned by the Rules of Religion and Vertue I am therefore not afraid to be try'd by good Christians and I hope to pass uncensured by good Criticks also notwithstanding the uncommon Manner in which I have attempted it  Five Acts I know are Customary But they can by no means be proved necessary On the Contrary if any determinate Number were to be appointed as a Standard  Three Acts  seem better than  Five  by the Critick's own Rule A  Beginning  a  Middle  and an  End  say these Gentlemen are the Stages of the Drama A first Act then would open and prepare the Matter intended A Second would perfect and heighten it to its Summit and the Third in a just and natural Descent serves to clear up the Embarrasments  and bring on the Catastrophe Thus may  Three  Acts he defended by  Reason  better than  Five  from  Custom  But I intend not hereby to promote the Introduction of a new Manner  This  Tragedy  was writ so short for want of Time to enlarge it by Addition of other Characters and Episodical Incidents yet because I would not be subject to the Reproaches of mistaken Petulance I thought it necessary to observe that if a  dramatic  Story is compleat in its  Preparation Progress  and  Conclusion  it is of no great Importance what Number of Acts it consists of  But one general Error if I mistake not among Writers of  TRAGEDY  is a Failure in their very  Principle  They teach not a  Moral  but describe some Piece of  History  The Business of the  STAGE  if I apprehend it rightly is first to intend some general and useful  Instruction  how Men may avoid certain Mischiefs in Life by correcting those Passions which must naturally produce them and then to find or invent some  Story  which may serve as an  Example  for strengthening that  Precept  and shew a Man made miserable by Effect of those Passions which the Writer would teach his Audience to resist or keep Guard against Every Thing in a  Tragedy  which has not a direct and visible Tendency to the Moral it is writ for is superfluous and monstrous and however pompously embellished serves for nothing but to weaken the Instruction  and distract the Attention and Apprehension of an Audience  I took the Hint and only the Hint as the Reader may see of that Story which I have fitted to the Moral of the following little Piece from  SHAKESPEAR'S Yorkshire Tragedy  which was put into my Hands on purpose by my good Friend Mr  Hill  to whom I take this Occasion of expressing my Gratitude in the most publick manner I can all Endeavours beside Acknowledgments being vain to match the Instances of his Friendship and that uncommon Humanity and Frankness of Spirit so peculiar to himself in his manner of bestowing Favours But 'tis needless to tell the World how much I am oblig'd to him and what just Sense I have of his generous Regard to me They who know him well and what a Waste of his important Time he has made for my Interest will be beforehand with my Acknowledgements and enumerate the Advantages which I could not miss from his FriendshipI owe much in the Scheme in the Sentiments and Language of this Piece to the Direction of that accomplished Gentleman who has either no Enemies or they are such because Strangers to his good Qualities for 'tis only necessary to  know  him to be by Choice or Obligation made inviolably his ownI embrace this Opportunity of thanking him for his excellent Prologue which so well prepared the Audience for the Representation Nor can I help thanking him even for the Epilogue tho' not less pleasant on my self than  on my Adversaries among the  Scots  Clergy for who would not be contented under a Stroke or two of his Satyr whose  Praise  as  Juba  says of  Cato  I would rather have than Worlds for my Admirers  Before I end this Preface I must not forget to thank the Generosity of my Friends of all Qualities who so nobly grac'd the Action of my first Endeavour in  TRAGEDY  I should have very little Merit not to improve on such EncouragementBefore so select and illustrious an Audience the admirable Mrs  Seymour  and the Gentlemen who so well performed the Parts must have felt a Satisfaction equal to that Applause which their Action deserved and met with  PROLOGUE Written by AARON HILL  Esq  Spoken by Mr RYAN  WArm'd by a Kindred Sense of  England  's Woes  A  Caledonian  Muse with Pity glows  From ruin'd Hopes a saving Moral takes  And paints th' Unhappy for the Happy's Sakes  Scotland  's new Taste our meaning Scene supplies  And a first Flight on Tragick Pinions

fir'd by rifing Arts she grasps the Boys  And her old Cant like falling Stocks decays  Her longlost Muse newlights her ancient Flame  And our Scene blazes with recover'd Fame  We teach to Nightah

Will all your generous Hearts tis bop'd engage  None can their Pity for those Woes conceal  Which most who hear perhaps too deeply feel  The Rants of ruin'd Kings of mighty Name  For pompous Misery small Compassion claim  Empires o'rturn'd and Heroes held in Chains  Alarm the Mind but give the Heart no Pains  To Ills remote from our Domestic Fears  We lend our Wonder but withhold our Tears  Not so when from such Passions as our own  Some Favourite Folly's dreadful Fate is shown  There the Soul bleeds for what it feels within  And conscious Pity shakes at suffering Sin  O give Attention to the moving Scene  And shun what yet may be by what has been  THE EPILOGUE Written by AARON HILL  Esq  Spoke by Mrs SEYMOUR  You've seen the  Play  and  I'll unfold  the  Poet  To whomstray'd Sheep of

Fatal Extravagance  SCENE  Bellmour  's House  Enter  Louisa  and  Courtney  _TWAS kind this Speed of your Return  Louisa  But tell me  What Success had you Was my Father mov'd  Methinks I read your News in your sad Visage  And my Heart trembles with prophetick Fears  Courtney  'Tis as I judg'd 'twou'd be His own Wants press him  He sinks beneath your Husband's wastful Life  Those boundless Dicings and voluptuous Riots  And this last worst Adventure of lost Hope  Which has at once dissolv'd a Wealth so vast  That Pity scarce vouchsafes to feel his Sufferings  Lou  But his late Conduct proves my  Bellmour  chang'd  Misfortunes have instructed him to  think  And  Thought  has captiv'd every madding Passion  Court  Yet early Vice by Custom long indulg'd  Leaves such Impression of habitual Ill  As finds no Cure but from severe Remorse  And Time's slow working  Lou  Nay name not  Bellmour  's Vice  He has no ViceHis very Power is lost  Even had he Taste for FolliesPoor and despis'd  The Slaves for whose curs'd Sakes he stands reproach'd  Now shun his Converse Villains who betray'd him  Start when they meet him Poverty like his  Spreads a Contagion round it All Mankind  Cry "Lord have Mercy and fly frighted from him  Did you lay open our incumbent Ruin  Urg'd you my Father strongly Want's cold Hand  Creeps o'er us and 'tis now no Time for Counsel  Court  I told him all and mov'd his utmost Pity  Still as he set to view your Husband's Failings  I urg'd his Virtues and bore down the Ballance  I prais'd his Wit his Courage his Humanity  His fine frank Spirit and his generous Nature  But 'twas lost HopeBelieve his Brother knows him  What he has done already weighs him down  His struggling Will to save you has undone him  And  Bellmour  's self wou'd there beg Aid in Vain  Lou  O he was never born to be a Beggar  Heaven is too kind to Goodness to forsake him  He whom soft Pity melts at other's Misery  Deserves himself to live exempt from Woe  Bellmour  could ne'er behold a Stranger wretched  But he partook his Pain 'till he cou'd ease it  How then will he support the weeping anguish  Of three poor Children all un  one by  Him  Court  His Good and Ill so chequer out his Nature  That  which  excells is doubtful Nobly  will'd  His pitying Heart flows out in generous Purposes  But wanting Power to stem the Tide of Pleasure  Irresolute he drives and floats to Ruin  Men must be rigid and severe in Virtue  Serious and noble Aims distinguish Reason  To live for Taste is not to live at all  The Man of Pleasure dreams away his Days  And dies to be forgotten  Bellmour  's  Soul  Had Contemplation bent it to a Byas  Had given a  Point  to Fame's proud Pinacle  And purpled o'er his Name with deathless Glory  Now it lies lost in DustI wou'd 'twere mine  To skreen you from the Storm that's gathering round you  But I unbless'd with Power can only  wish  And wonder why the Strong have feeble Wills  Lou  Oh I shall tremble to behold his Face  His ruin'd Family hangs on his Heart  His helpless Children's future Fate distracts him  And the once lively  Bellmour  smiles no more  Silent he walks or stands with folded Arms  And still looks down as if his Soul were Earth  If e'er by chance his lifted Eyes meet mine  The starting Tears glare dreadfully upon me  And quivering struggle to flow loose in Sorrow  Then Sighs suppress'd by Force strive hard for Vent  And heave and swell like Earthquakes in his Bosom  at length he breaks in Whirlwind from me  Torn by ten thousand Pangs raves reddens starts  And frights me with a drea  ful burst of Passions  O Uncle what remains for Hope to snatch at  Of all the wide Estate that late enclos'd us  But th  s poor House is left usThis  too  totters  Soon  Rain  with his  palsied  Hand will seize  This antient Pile and shake it into Dust  Not thrice the Worth of all that now is ours  Will save poor  Woodly  from that fatal Bond  He sign'd to serve my  Bellmour  All our Hope  Was in vour frie  dly Journey to my Father  Woodly  must sink and  Bellmour  cannot bear it  Bellmour  will never live to sink a Friend  Look yonder where in pensive Grief he walks  Unhoping and disconsolate  Cour  Poor  Bellmour  How chang'd from that wild noisy joyful Rioter  Which all his Friends have known him Still extream  Enter  Bellmour  walking Mellancholly  Lou  My Life my  Bellmour  wound not thus my Soul  I have more Woes to bear that are my own  Than my Strength matchesadd not thou thy Sorrow  That  would o'erwhelm me quite  Bell  I pray forgive me  Prison'd in Thought I could not look about me  And my Soul miss'd thy ComfortI was musing  Lou  What sad Reflection held you  Bell  A mournful Wandering  No matter now  Lou  Nay you must tell it me  Bell  I was considering which of my three Boys  Some few Years hence when I'm dissolv'd in Death  Will act the Beggar best run barefoot fastest  And with most dextrous Shrugg play Tricks for Charity  Lou  O for Heaven's Sake forbear by Starts like This  To image Horrors Nature shrinks at Thought of  Bell  Why my  Louisa  'tis a Wretch's Duty  To learn to bear his Miseryto know it  To use our selves to  poize  it is the Means  To make it easie to usYet I'm to blame  Thou had'st no share in any Guilt of mine  I ought  alone  to suffer'Twas too cruel  'Twas even unmanly to afflict thy Innocence  Cour  Oh Sir you sooth the Grief you should resist  As the gross Atmosphere is shook by Tempests  Which never ruffle the superior Regions  Mean  Spirits only buckle under Woe  It is the great Man's Pride to  combat  Fortune  And rise against Oppression  Bell  Sir 'tis true  And I remember you have oft advis'd it  While I had Power to try my Virtue's Proof  A Man may  dye  unhelp'dbut must not hope  To  Conquer  without ArmsTalking of Help  Will your good Brother lend itSpeaking Silence  How could I hope it from him  Cour  Yet despair not  A time may come when even your Woes shall prove  Great Benefits Firm Spirits break Misfortunes  To suffer well's the noblest way to Conquest  On a smooth Sea the Sailor shows no Skill  But he displays it  all  in Hurricanes  Bell  He wou'd not sure neglect to save his Daughter  Had he the Power still left himYet Friends  Are more than Fathers A Father  cannot  be sometimes  More than a FriendI had a Friend in  Woodly  Once  he was happywhat he shall be  hereafter  He owes to friendless  Bellmour  Perish the Name  To what a stinging Death is he reserv'd  Who leaves a good Man wretched whom he  made  so  Sir it wou'd ease me of a galling Pain  Wou'd you disolve this disappointed Hope  In  Woodly  's Breast'Twere Sin to nourish it  Since 'tis unstableHe must know it soon  Let it be told by any Tongue but  Bellmour  's  Cour  I'll visit him this InstantDo you mean while  Bravely seek Comfort from a firm Belief  That Heaven befriends your Virtues and will save you  A Hand unseen these Clouds of Woe may clear  And into Triumph turn distracting Fear  Exit  Courtney  Bell  Louisa  I am Damn'd while yet alive  Loui  Alas what mean you to distract me thus  With your wild Startings  Bell  Nay but mark me well  Want's  the Damnation of a living Sinner  What have I liv'd for if I die a Beggar  Why were my Ancestors renown'd in  War  Why with grave Judges have they grac'd the Bench  Or with wise Votes the SenateIn  Me  must  beg  Mark that lean Word  Louisa  In  Me  must beg  That ebbing Name which through a length of Ages  Has given a Kingdom Honour Bear'st thou  That  How excellent art Thou not to have scorn'd me  Good Heaven that Reason should give Madness way  'Till Man finds Musick in a ratling Dicebox  And has contracted thrice three thousand Acres  To the curs'd Compass of a narrow Table  With what a thoughtless Rapture have I shook 'em  Hung o'er the Throw and hurl'd out my Posterity  Pimps Thieves or BeggarsBut then at last  This Madman's Hazard of my treasur'd Remnant  In the wild Lottery of a publick Hope  Where Reason had no Chance and Villains govern'd  Curs'd groundless RashnessTear me Limb from Limb  Some pitying Torturer to die at once  Were Comfort even in AgonyBut I shall be  Whole Ages  after  Death in dyingVillains  Dull pityless insulting dirty Villains  Will point at some poor ragged Child of mine  And say 'There's Pride and Name There's  Bellmour  's Honour  'There's the blest Remnant of a boasted Family  Curse the keen Thought It pours all Hell upon me  Lou  Still wilt thou thus snatch at Despair's wild Shadows  I thought the manly Soul cou'd Smile at Anguisn  Woman's weak mind may bend beneath Adversity  But  Bellmour  's Brow methinks shou'd wear a Majesty  And make Affliction awful  Bell  Away with Counsel  I cannot hear Thee Thy moving Air thy wisdom  That Lovely Softness which  bewitches  round Thee  Each charm which has a thousand times appeas'd me  Now makes me mad Like Oyl pour'd out on Flame  I tower in Blaze and burn with tenfold Firceness  Thy ev'ry word is Death Each look thou giv'st me  Breaks thro' my Eye comes rushing on my Soul  And shoots sharp Arrows thro' my bleeding Conscience  Thinkst thou I am so mean so lost a Wretch  That my  own  Misery stings me Cruel Woman  What  earthly  Ills can  Bellmour  stoop to fear  Which hurt  but Bellmour  'Tis true indeed  thy  Fate  I have not learn'd to bear  There  Grief unmans me  Thine and thy helpless Infants Woes rise to me  Glare on my Apprehension like pale Ghosts  And point me into madnessOh I've wronged Thee  Lou  'Tis wronging me to say it  Reenter  Courtney  Bell  Courtney  return'd so soon  I like not this  Lou  Why look you pale good Uncle  Cour  To bring unwelcome Tidings to the wretched  Gives the sad Teller half the Hearer's Woe  Bell  Friendly Preparative What follows next  Can be but  Woodley  's Ruin  Cour  He's undone  Lou  Unhappy  Bellmour  Cour  Near your House I met him  Hemm'd by a swarthy Guard of licens'd Villains  The Laws grim BloodHounds With rapacious Talons  They dragg'd him on in merciless Serenity  To shut him from his Hopes in joyless Prison  Bell  Oh  Cour  At short distance near the Sycamore  That marks the Turning to that nowfall'n House  Of this poor Gentleman I saw his Lady  Wild with a Storm of Grief Her Hair dishevel'd  And her loose Robes blown careless by the Wind  Struggling with weeping Servants to break free  Fain wou'd she follow him to share Restraint  But by superior Force held back and hindered  With straining Eyes she kept him long in view  And when a gushing Flood obscur'd her Sight  Still more to lengthen out a last sad Look  She wip'd away the Tears and gaz'd again  Lou  Dreadful DescriptionClose it here good Uncle  It cuts too deep and wounds my  Bellmour  's Soul  Cour  No more remains to tell but that his House  Is fill'd with Russians his rich Goods torn down  And his griev'd Wife and Children roam unshelter'd  Without a Home to succour them  Lou  O guide them hither  Let me with open Arms fly to receive them  And strive if possible to give them Comfort  Bell  Louisa  As thou wouldst preserve my Life  Bring not their Grief too near meMy melting Soul  Flows into Air as I but  hear  their Misery  To  see  it wou'd distract me  Said  he nothing  Cour  Marking me as I turn'd my Face aside  He call'd and counsell'd you to save yourself  By sudden FlightSince other Ruffians brought  By  Bargrave  your malicious Creditor  Will presently be here on the same Purpose  As for  my  Fate said he bid him not mourn it  To fall for  Bellmour  wou'd have given me  Joy  Had  Bellmour  's self not fall'n  Bell  He falls indeed  Cour  Now as I enter'd  Bargrave  just arriv'd  With his in fernal Crew besets your Gates  A barbarous Triumph glows on his proud Cheek  And from beneath his Brows o'erjutting  Low'r  Malicious Insults grin in hollow Ambush  Lou  Now  Bellmour  thou art lostimmediate Ruin  Will swallow  Thee  and  Me  and our dear  Children  All All must sink togetherTeach us good Uncle  Which way to fly What measures to pursue  Cour  The Doors fast barr'd are guarded by your Servants  And you may thro' the Grove escape unseen  Bell  Nolet him enterThis  Bargrave  taught me Vice  And counsell'd even the Adventure that undoes me  He wrongs the Devil who makes himself the Punisher  Of Ills which he excited Justice acts wisely  Oh She's  not  BlindShe chuses a fit Moment  And throws him on my Vengeance Let him enter  Bring he as many Lives as he has Crimes  May Curses catch me if he scape my Hand  Lou  As thou lov'st me  Bellmour  be not rash  Should'st thou add Murder to our other Woes  How wretched shou'd we be  Cour  Persuade him rather  Sooth him to Pity Wou'd he free your Friend  And add some Weeks of Liberty for Tryal  What Succour may be found you've many Friends  Who knows what unhop'd Aid may rise to save you  Bell  No  Courtney  Friendship  rises  but with Fortune  And  sets  when Men go downward yet I thank you  Rage had obscur'd my ReasonSay to  Bargrave  I have an Offer for his private Ear  I will instruct my Swelling Indignation  To cool and settle like a Courtier's Passions  What cannot Interest teach us  Exit  Courtney  Leave me  Louisa  I wou'd not have thee blast thy innocent Eyes  With sight of such a monsterNor brook I well  That thou who hast been taught to love Sincerity  Shou'dst hear me flatter Infamy  Lou  Do but think  'Tis for their Sakes whom most you wish to Succour  And you will find it easy Farewell he comes  Exit  Louisa  Enter  Bargrave  Bar  So Sir I find you make your House your Garrison  Bold sowerfac'd Centinels admit with Caution  Whom you vouchsafe your Pass toTis great indeed  Girt Sovereignlike within your Palace Walls  The Law must  beg  Admission But the Pride  With which your State o'erlook'd me will Instruct me  Till I find Means to reach you  Bell  I sent not for you  Thus to revive old Hatred 'Twas my Meaning  To set before your Eyes the spreading Misery  From which a Week's short Respite may perhaps  Free  Woodly  and my self nor do you wrong  Bar  Oh Sir no doubt 'tis likely that Seven Days  Will pay a Bond which twice Seven Months and more  Has drawn no Interest from you  Woodly  may claim  Some little PityHe's a suffering Tool  Who Fasts to feed your Riots But for you  No Plea bears Influence What a mass of Wealth  Loaded your Youth The Toil of careful Ancestorsâª  And how it is consum'd let Thousands tell  Whose lifted Eyes and Hands proclaim their Wonder  I dare not whisper itMen won'd think me Mad  And laugh to hear that the once liberal  Bellmour  Is grown a Niggard now and like a Miser  Whines for a Day of GraceAnd swears 'twill ruin him  To pay his CreditorsName it no more  Should it get Wind 'twou'd lower your tow'ring TopSails  And lose you many a Cap and Country Shout  As vou ride thro' the Villages  Bell  Insulting Wretch  It grates my inmost Soul to suffer this  But my Friend's Fate depends on'tYou seem'd to speak  As if you pity'd  Woodly  Give him Liberty  And let me fill the Place to which you've sent him  I ask no moreFor my own Miseries  Perhaps they merit notI'm sure they  scorn  What Pity thou can'st give them  Bar  Oft I remember  Woodly  with zeal for holy Texts transported  Wou'd preach and cite DivinityDull Dull  How cou'd he miss that Caution which forbad him  To be another's Surety What comes after  He now perhaps has learntAnd will remember  When next he talks to edify  Bell  Nay then  Off mean Hypocrisy I'll make thee hear me  In Words which match thy Malice Think low Traytor  How I first learn'd that Guilt with which but now  Thy Tongue reproach'd me Who but the Villain  Bargrave  Bar  Ha Villain said you  offering to draw  Bell  Yes the Villain  Bargrave  Touch not thy SwordShould'st thou unsheath it here  Thy Guardian Devil too weak to save his Minister  Should rise in vain betwixt us  Bar  I'll hear thee out  Bell  Who but thy self spread all those Snares about me  Which first entangling next o'erthrew my Virtue  Who stain'd the Native Whiteness of my Soul  And spotted it with Follies Think how this Bond  Was fraudulently and by shameful Arts  Won from my clouded Reason when the Fumes  Of madding Wine had warm'd my yielding Fancy  Fit for a Knaves Impression Hast thou Humanity  And dost not feel a Ruin thou hast caus'd  Hast thou Reflection and canst thou sleep unstung  By guilty Startings and remorseful Dreams  Or have the Fiends that haunt thy gloomy Bosom  Unhumaniz'd thy Heart sear'd up thy Conscience  And left all Devil within thee  Bar  Now take Breath  And hear me tell the Effect of this fine Pleading  I find my self with all these black Endowments  Your Master and your ScourgeBut that I scorn thee  I could be angry Mark this silent Witness  Look on this Bond And curse the woeful Hour  That gave thy Friend and thee to my Disposal  I'll leave our Wives to  scold  the Quarrel out  While I seek Vengeance not from Words but Action  He attempts to go out  Bell  By Action didst thou say I thank thee  Bargrave  Thou hast instructed Me That fatal Bond  Shall never rise in Judgment against  Woodly  Drawing his Sword and putting himself before the Door  Just Heav'n that hates Oppression points a Way  To case my wretchedness of half its Load  By cutting thro' that Chain that binds my Friend  Now' if thou dar'st defend thy Villainies  Unsheath thy Sword and to this guarded Door  Force thy wish'd Passage thro' the Breast of  Bellmour  They fight and  Bargrave  falls  Bar  Curses consume that all destroying Hand  Spite of my wish'd Revenge thou wilt escape me  No Heir survives to put the Bond in Proof  And  Woodly  and thy self are free again  He dies  Enter  Courtney  surpriz'd And  Louisa  at another Door  Cour  What have you done I fear'd this rash Effect  Of Rage but half suppress'd And waited near  But an Attempt yon Bloodhounds made without  To force an Entrance call'd me off too fatally  Lou  Was this my  Belmour  Speak was this the way  To ease our Wretchedness Oh this black Chance  Sinks us still deeper Cuts us off from Comfort  And we can never now be happy more  Bell  Courtney  'twere vain to wish this Act undone  Scarce can it claim Repentance Secret and sudden  Let me entreat thee to convey this Parchment  Taking the Bond from  Bargrave's  Pocket  Into my  Woodly's  Hand Say how it happen'd  Tell him whatever Fate may do with  me  I'm bless'd to give him Freedom  Cour  Guard the Doors well There's Danger near  And I'll not leave you long  Exit  Courtney  Lou  Fly for Heaven's sake begone  One Hours delay prevents Escape for ever  Bell  What woud'st thou have me do  Lou  Let me disguise thee  Then thro' the Grove hast and in some poor Cottage  Entreat a short Concealment There I'll find thee  And we'll consult Relief from all our Woes  Bell  Fix'd as my Fate I stand unmov'd to expect it  I'll not stir hence by Heav'n  Lou  Oh do not Swear  Think how my Peace of Mind my Hope my Misery  Depends on Thine Thus on my Knees I urge it  Thou  being free may'st find a thousand Ways  To succour  us  but if  thou  fall'st a  Family  A Lost a Friendless Family falls  with  thee  Oh if I ever was belov'd by  Bellmour  If all my Pray'rs my Vows my Tears can move him  Let him but grant me this Let him but  leave  me  Rain  then a world  of Woes upon my Head  Let Want Reproach Contempt and all Life's Agonies  In ceaseless Bitterness of Soul afflict me  While  thou  art safe if I but let one  Sigh  One  Breath  of Discontent escape my Lips  Curse me  thy self  and make me lost indeed  Bell  Excellent Womanrise To see thee  thus  Is  Torture beyond bearing  Lou  I will not leave thee  Here at thy Feet thus humbled as that Dust  Which I shall shortly be when I have lost thee  Here will I grow for ever till thou grant'st  This only Pray'r I make thee  Bell  Thou bidst me  fly  What would'st thou I should fly from  Lou  Danger and Misery  Bell  With whom then must I  leave  that Misery  Must not thy self and those Three friendless Wretches  Whose Being I was Cause of and who expect  Aid and Protection from a Parent's Hand  While I escape must you not all be left  Hell glows in that hot Thought be left expos'd  To all the Miseries which thou would  st have me  Fly like a Coward from and leave for Innocents  Who owe 'em to my Baseness no My  Louisa  Wretch as I  have  been I'm not fall'n  so  low  Lou  rising  Lost Lost for ever  Bell  No there's a Judge on high  Who sees and loves thy Goodness Let me entreat thee  To give my Sorrows way for a few Moments  A Solitary Thought a Turn or two  Uninterrupted in the Gallery  Will teach me to resolve and then I'll call thee  Exit Bellmour  Lou  Angels assist and guide thy silent Reasonings  And from this Labyrinth of Woes unwind thee  Dismal our Prospect yet all  may  be well  Heav'n cannot erroft guides us in the Dark  And when we least expect affords relief  As thro' black storms of Wind and driving Rain  Short Sunny Beamings streak the harrass'd Main  So thro deep Sorrows Gleams of Comfort rise  And spread smooth Heavens before the Sufferers Eyes  Exit Louisa  SCENE  changes to a Gallery  Enter  Bellmour  alone Pensive  Bell  Why shou'd I pause Nothing can be a Crime  Which puts a stop to Evil A thousand Men  May have been poor as Iand yet liv'd happy  Miseries  we make  our selves  are born with Ease  But He who beggars his Posterity  Begets a Race to curse himProfuse in Ills  He  propagating Ruin with his Name  Entails Descent of AnguishEvery Scorn  Which wrings the Soul of any future  Bellmour  Whom Want shall pinch the Bones of Ages hence  Will  mark  with Shame my unforgotten Grave  And reach my guilty Soul where e'er it wanders  If to give Misery to those to whom  We once gave Life is an inhuman Crime  How can it be a Sin to take Life back  And put an End to Misery To live  Is to be rack'd if Life must still be poor  For Poverty gives up the Wise Man's Worth  To the Contempt of tasteless Ignorance  OhCou'd I feel no Misery but my own  How easy were it for this Sword to free me  From all that Anguish which embitters Life  But when the Grave has given  my  Sorrows Rest  Where shall my miserable  Wife  find Comfort  Unfriended and alone in Want's bleak Storm  Not all the Angelic Virtues of her Mind  Will shield her from the unpitying World's Derision  Can it be kind to leave her so expos'd  And while I sleep in Death not dream of  Her  Better a thousand Times to lead her  with  me  Thro' the dark Doubtfulness of deep  Futurity  Whate'er uncertain Fate attends hereafter  It can but be the worst of what is bad  And that's our State alreadyIt shall be done  But how That asks some ThoughtDeath in it self  Comes soft and sweetly as an Infant's Sleep  When Nature unalarm'd expects it not  From those dear destin'd Breasts the pointed Steel  Must draw no Blood to stain my blushing Hand  Lest my Soul start and that seem Cruelty  Which I wou'd fain think PityHark The Time presses me  Loud Knockings without  What if I use th'unwounding Aid of Poison  I have at Hand that Sovereign Remedy  For all Diseases Want and Woe can plague with  Mix'd with some unfear'd Draught 'twill gently Murder  Bear off Death's painful Edge and in sweet Slumber  Swim soft and shadowy o'er the misty Eyeball  Enter  Louisa  Lou  Will you forgive me if Officious Love  That anxious Pain I feel till  you  are safe  Obtrudes my Zeal perhaps a few short Moments  Before you wou'd have wish'd to be disturb'd  Yon Villains grow impatient for Admission  And scarce your Servants guard the Gates against them  Storms of bold Oaths and horrible Reproaches  Mix'd with loud Thunderings and the Threa's of Law  Make my Heart tremble and have forc'd me hither  Forc'd me to urge you by all Ties of Love  Of Interest Honour Hope and future Happiness  To fly this dangerous Roof and save us All  Bell  I thank thy gentle CareIt is resolv'd  I have bethought me of a Means to evade  The Malice of my Fortune'Twill be a Journey  A little longer than thy Love could wish it  Yet not so far but we shall meet again  Lou  Oh be the Distance wide as Pole from Pole  Let me but follow Thee and I am bless'd  Bell  It shall be so  Louisa  Lou  A thousand Angels  Spread their Wings o'er thee and protect thy Steps  Now thou art kindBut the dear  little ones  Shall  They  go too  Bell  All all shall go  Lou  Hast then  Let us be gonemy bounding Heart leaps joyful  And I shall smile againBut ah me  Bellmour  They are so Young so Tender is it possible  That they should travel with us  Bell  Moving Innocence  My strong Heart bleeeds within me at her Accents  Aside  A few short Steps will lodge us in a Place  To her  Of Rest and Safetywe shall have Leisure there  To weigh our future Hopes and seek fit means  To our wish'd end  Courtney  will soon return  Said he not so  Lou  He did and we'll inform him  Of our new Purpose and begin our Flight  I'll make Provision such as best befits  Our Haste and our Distresses  She is going  Bell  S  ay  Louisa  Those boasted Cordials the  French  Marquis sent me  Gave I to Thee or no  Lou  You spoke of such  But still forgot  give 'em meand now  They're not worth Memory  Bell  Nay now most useful  Their Virtue is reported Sovereign  Against the Body's oil or Mind's Disturbance  Lou  Wou'd  Courtney  were come  Exeunt severally  Enter  Courtney  alone  Court  Strange that a Man should linger thus in Peril  The pointed Sword that by a slender Hair  Hung o'er the Head of  Damocles  was  Shadow  To  sellmour  's solid DangerI was told  He walks this wayI'll trace the Gallery round  And urge him to escapeFew Minutes more  May spread a Crowd of Eyes on every side  And fatally prevent him  Exit  Reenter  Bellmour  Bell  My baleful Hand has mix'd the deadly Draught  To give it as a CordialGive it  whome  Start from thy burning Orb thou conscious Sun  And chill thy selt to Frost at my black Purpose  Am I a Parent a Protector Lover  Or has this Devil that heaves about my Heart  Transform'd me to a Fiend He  has  He  has  Chain him some Angel millions of Fathoms down  Heap him with Mountains least he rise again  And in a Husband's and a Fathers Breast  Brew horrid MurdersI am my self once more  Now let cool Reason's undistracted Search  Answer my bleeding Soul  which  dreadful Ill  May best be born by NatureTo leave our Friends  To grinding Sorrow Poverty and Scorn  With sense of his not feeling  any  Pain  Who gave them allor to quit Life together  And wanting Pow'r to  bless  make it  some  Merit  Not to leave  Curses  to Surviving Innocence  I'm mad againReason her self betrays me  And whispers that this  last  is  Cruelty  And Murder grows a Mercy  Enter  Louisa  Lou  Found you the Cordial  Your little wanderers are ready dress'd  To act the Pilgrim with us perhaps 'twill aid  Their Fainting Spirits yet untried in Hardships  Bell  I cannot movemy Feet bound down by Nature  Rebel against my HeartOh If one Moment  One short  Thought  longer She oppress me thus  With melting Innocent  Talk  I shall grow Soft  Yield her to  Want  and live to be a  Beggar  Lou  Still you are doubtful  aside  Bell  NonoI'm fix'dOh Nature  aside  I left my Closet openon a Table  In that Gold Cup which was thy Father's Present  When thy first Favourite Boy's last BirthDay came  Thou'llt find the fittest CordialI try'd 'em all  And what seem'd properest for the Boys and Thee  Waits in that Cup thy tasting  Lou  Courtney  stays Long  All things are ready and I wish him here  Now for this boasted Cordial  Exit  Bell  Be firm my Heart  Stop thy big Beat Thaw thaw this curdling Blood  That thro' my Icy Veins creeps cold as Death  And freezes in its PassageWhere is  Louisa  But a few Moments and she is no more  Now now the unsuspecting Innocent  Lifts that last CupNow now She tastes a Draught  That snatches her for ever from my Sight  And robs me of her Comfort Never more  Shall her sweet Voice  enchant  me Never more  Shall her soft  Eyes  look fondly into mine  And  shine  with swimming LanguorNever never  VVill her unwearied Wit beguile my Cares  Or hush me  more  to Peace when Passion shakes me  Open engulph me and conceal my Shame  Befriending EarthOr from thy yawning Depth  Stream up a Night of Gloom to blot out Memory  And darken o'er ReflectionI feel my Blood  Cool and grow  thick  as melted Lead flows heavy  And hardens in it's motionA little longer  And I who have a  Heart  already Marble  Shall petrifie  throughout  and be a  Statue  Lou  My Life my Bellmour  within  Bell  Ha 'tis her Voice that calls me  It sounded not reproachful  Lou  Look look my  Bellmour  within  These little Strugglers will not quit the Cordial  But Sip it to the Bottom  Bell  Torturing Horror  aside  Enter  Louisa  with an empty Cup  Lou  How cou'd you be so rigid not to come  When I twice call'd you 'Twou'd have been a Scene  Of Pleasure to observe with how much Eagerness  The little Wranglers quarrell'd for the Cup  Which having drank my self I brought to  Them  I bid em  Taste  it onlyand told the Pratlers  It was their Father's Present But that word  Transported them to lift their pretty Hands  And brought a  War  about me  Bell  Furies tear me  Lou  Did you not give Permission they should taste it  E're they began the Journey  Bell  Alas  Louisa  A Long long Journey is indeed begun  But endless as EternityThy self  And those dear Infantsare  poyson'd  by that Cordial  Lou  Poison'd by  Thee  Thou sayst it but to try me  If 'twere thy Wish that I should die thy  Love  At least thy  Pity  wou'd have given some  Warning  Death is a dreadful Journey and requires  Much length of Preparation  Bell  By those Charms  Which I no more must gaze on and be bless'd  Thou can'st not live an HourA last long Sleep  Will steal in cold Advances o'er thy Beauties  And those two beamy Suns which sparkle on me  Anon shall set in DeathEven while we talk  The eternal Shade will rise at once between us  And sever us for ever  Lou  Dreadful Contraction  Of that short Span which at its longest stretch  Was much too narrow to allow me Scope  To  speak  or  look  or  think  my Love for Thee  What shall I sayA thousand tender Thoughts  Struggle at once for VentI cannot speak  Death is too hastyI have yet  undone  Unspoke unthought  a thousand weighty Things  O Heaven my  Little ones  Let me fly to them  Have I so short a time to gaze upon them  Yet ne'er must see'em moreI cannot leave Thee  What shall I doO Bring my Children hither  Fly with'em to my ArmsDear dying Innocents  Oh  Bellmour Bellmour  Why has this been done  Bell  That we might baffle Woe and die together  And leave no Beggars of our Race behind us  See my  Louisa  I have a faithful Guide  Drawing a Dagger  That will not let me lose thee  Stabs

conceal'd undreamt of Dagger  Prevented my near Vigilance had sav'd  Unhappy  Bellmour  Bell  Not unhappy now  We slide united from the Woes of Life  And Want's too slow to reach us  Court  Mistaken Man  The Hand of Heaven howe'er from mortal Eyes  Obsour'd in Clouds still points direct at Justice  Not thy three Children nor thy guiltless Wife  But Thou alone art fallen whose single Crime  Drew down a single Vengeance  Lou  Alas what mean you  Bell  Thou little know'st the deadly Means I us'd  If thou conceiv'st me frustrated  Court  Hear then with Wonder  And trembling mark the mazy Paths of Providence Seeking you on the Gallery's Garden Side  I in your Closet spy'd a late fill'd Cup  With a small Vial near itTo the Neck  There hung a LabelBy the Name inscrib'd  I saw with sad surprize it had held Poison Concluding you had newly mingled it  With that rich Draught it stood byFrom a Window  I threw it on the Gardenrefill'd the Cup  Without its deadly mixtureand stood conceal'd  To watch what happen'dwhen  Louisa  came  And snatch'd it thence I follow'd her unmark'd  Pleas'd to have been a means to intercept  Hers and her Childrens DeathThe Rest you know  too  well  Bell  Angels Surround thee with unceasing Vigilance  And for this Friendship ward off every evil  Oh I have err'd  Lou  Oh too too partial Blessing  Faint Sweet with more than poysonous Bitter mix'd  Now  Bellmour  tell mewas it not a Crime  To distrust Heaven Else thou hadst liv'dand then  VVe had all perhaps been blest  Cour  You had indeed  By a young Kinsman landed from a Ship  That left her Consort scarce a Day behind  Woodly  has heard suprizing Newsyour Brother  Absent so many Years and long thought Dead  Returning Rich from the remotest East  Dy'd but in sight of Land and has bequeathd  His whole
