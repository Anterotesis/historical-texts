has displayed an elegance and variety of co∣lours sufficient to arrest the admiration of ancient philosophers and furnish them with the happiest simile to abash human osten∣tation  When Croesus king of Lydia was seated on his throne adorned with royal magnificence and all the barbarous pomp of eastern splendour he asked Solon if he had ever beheld any thing so fine The Greek Philosopher no way moved by the objects before him or taking a pride in his native simplicity replied that after having seen the beautiful plumage of the Pheasant he could be astonished at no other finery  BUFFON    Perhaps there are few tribes of birds in which nature has been more profuse of her amplest colouring than that of the Pheasant The common species as we now consider it in this country notwith∣standing its beauty is inferior in that respect to two others that are also found at large in some of our woods The Ring and painted Pheasants are far more richly decorated and these may probably be as abundant in future generations as the Common Pheasant is at present The variegated Pheasant is beautiful and the scarcely ex∣ampled delicacy of the White kind renders it an interesting variety  The beauty of all these varieties are however eclipsed by the Argus Pheasant and probably were we better acquainted with the Phasianus superbus and some other gigantic Chinese species  Colonel Davies has a drawing of the tail feather of one of the Chinese species of Pheasants which is six feet in length  we might place them among the most brilliant of the feathered race  At what period of time the Pheasant was introduced into this Country it is impossible now to ascertain They have in all pro∣bability been long naturalized in this Country Some of our do∣mestic fowls it is supposed were introduced more than two thou∣sand years ago  Caesar  noticing them Whether this circum∣stance may assist conjecture concerning the introduction of the Pheasant we dare not presume to determine Pheasants were first brought into Europe from the banks of the Phasis a river of ancient Colchis in Asia Minor at present it is found throughout Europe in a wild state It has not hitherto been discovered in America  The female is smaller than the male the general colour brown variegated with other obscure colours the tail is shorter than in the male and the space round the eye which is bare in that sex is covered with feathers in the female  They breed like the Partridge on the ground Lay from twelve to fifteen eggs smaller than those of the hen and of a paler colour than those of the Partridge The young follow the females like Chickens  Several authors have noticed a circumstance of this bird which surprising as it may appear is by no means peculiar to the Pheasant  only After the hen has done laying and setting the plumage of the female becomes like that of the male and she is then entirely neg∣lected by him  Salerne Edwards  and others have mentioned this of the Pheasant Guinea Hen Rock Manakin c and Mr J Hunter had a paper in the Philosophical Transactions on that subject Latham observes that it does not always require  mature age  to give the hen Pheasant the appearance of the male  PLATE CII ANAS ALBIFRONS WHITE FRONTED GOOSE  ANSERES  Bill obtuse covered with a thin membrane broad gibbous below the base swelled at the apex Tongue fleshy Legs naked Feet

colours or elegance of form to render it an interesting species The white space on the forehead is the most striking peculiarity of the bird and its name is sufficiently characteristic of that part to distinguish it from every other British species of the Duck tribe It is found in the fens in small flocks during winter and migrates in March In England it is rather uncommon  Linnaeus considered the White Fronted Goose as the female of the Bernacle Goose of which credulity has reported so much and we may think naturalists have said too little for it seems yet but doubt∣ful with some Ornithologists whether the opinion of Linnaeus be wholly unfounded in truth or not though they have ventured to se∣parate them into distinct species  As many kinds of the Duck tribe inhabit the lakes and forests of Lapland and other arctic regions during the breeding season it is difficult in some instances to distinguish the mere differences of sex or age from specific distinctions The bernacle of which the white fronted Goose has been supposed the female were believed about two hundred years to be bred on the coast of Scotland but those  who asserted this declared also that they were generated out of  de∣cayed wood  or were hatched in the shell of the Lepas Antifera a marine production very common in those parts It has several membranous branches or arms and at the end of each is

Gold∣finch claims a decided preference to our attention It would be su∣perfluous to expatiate on the beauty of a bird so well known and difficult to add any information to its general history that has escaped the notice of ornithologists  The Goldfinch is found throughout Europe and in many parts of Africa and Asia The varieties of it are numerous Latham men∣tions  no less than eight kinds One of these is like the common sort except the fore part of the head which is red and about the eyes white Another supposed to be a mixed breed with the Lark has a fleshcoloured bill irides yellowish head throat and neck black spotted with red near the bill breast back scapulars and rump yellowish brown belly sides thighs and under tail coverts white  Instances of Goldfinches wholly white sometimes occur one specimen of that kind is preserved in the Leverian Museum and another in which those parts only which are red in the common sort have a glossy tinge of that colour A third sort in the same collection is white except the crown of the head which is mottled with red and a crescent of the same colour under the throat the wings are yellowish  Goldfinches of the opposite extreme of colour are not uncommon Some are entirely black with a slight trace of red about the head in others even this trace is obliterated Birds that are fed on hemp seed of which the Goldfinch will eat freely often become entirely black Buffon mentions one in which the head only was of that colour Willughby and Ray describe a variety that had no red on the head but a saffroncoloured ring surrounded the bill Brown has another with the head striped alternately with red and yellow Buffon and Brisson have a sort in which the wings and tail are brownish ashcolour and that part dingy which in the common sort is yellow In young birds of the common sort the head is grey  The nest of the Goldfinch is curiously constructed of moss liverwort thistledown c and lined with wool hair and the down of  the sallow It lays five eggs of a whitish colour and marked with deep purple spots  These birds breed twice in a year In winter they assemble in flocks Generally frequent places where thistles grow in abundance being particularly fond of the seeds of those plants  PLATE CIV RALLUS AQUATICUS WATER RAIL  GRALLAE  Bill roundish Tongue entire fleshy Thighs naked Toes divided  GENERIC GHARACTER  Bill compressed

England Our specimen was shot in the  Hebrides  It is observed of this species that it grows much larger in North America than in Europe In Russia and Siberia it is very common  This Bird lives chiefly on Fish which it takes in the same manner as the Osprey It is supposed that the Eagle mentioned by  Kolben  is this species he says at the  Cape of Good Hope  it feeds on the Land Tortoises which it carries into the air to a considerable height and by letting it fall on some rock dashes the shell in pieces that it may more easily pick out the flesh  PLATE CVI FULICA ATRA COMMON COOT

that the Roman Pigeon  Columba Hispanica  of Linneus has given birth to all these varieties  That kind called the  Carrier  is much celebrated for its particular attachment to its native place It was anciently used in many eastern countries to convey letters with expedition at present the custom is not so general  Joinville  speaks of them in the crusade of St Louis to Palestine and  Tasso  in the siege of Jerusalem c The custom of conveying letters by means of these Birds may be traced to a very early period It is not only related of them but of Swallows by  Pliny  and  Aelian  that they were employed on such service and the earliest poets who generally intermingled some truth with their alle∣gory made the Dove the messenger of the lover and emblem of innocence  "Gentle Dove  "Whither fly'st thou from above"  "From  Anacreon  friend I rove  Bearing  mandates  to his love"  Anacreon Ode    to Bathyllus  All writers on Egypt mention the vast number of Pigeons that are bred in that part of the world where they proverbially constitute a great portion of the poor husbandman's estate In Persia also they are bred in immense numbers They are altogether a pleasing and useful species in whatever country they are domesticated  Their dung is used for tanning leather is a valuable manure for the land and is employed in medicine formerly saltpetre was collected from it It is used for many other purposes by distant nations  Vide Lath    In a wild state these Birds have two broods in a year in a state of confinement sometimes three They usually lay two eggs at a time and sit from fourteen to seventeen days before the young are hatched They migrate in vast multitudes into the south of England at the approach of winter and return again in spring They frequent woody places and commonly build in the hollows of decayed trees  PLATE CVIII MOTACILLA LUSCINIA NIGHTINGALE  PASSERES  Bill conic pointed Nostrils oval broad naked  GENERIC CHARACTER  Bill slender weak Nostrils small

makes her nest in a low coppice or quickset hedge that is thickly cloathed with foliage It is composed of hay and reeds intermingled with oak leaves c She lays four or five eggs of a greenish brown colour The male scarcely differs from the female  In the evening the Nightingale begins a song that continues till morning Concealed in some thicket this charming songster pours forth those melodious strains whose harmony sweetness and variety combine to fill the mind with soft emotions of sensibility and endear solitude to the contemplative man The Nightingale is the favourite of every rural poet and the loftiest  genius  has constantly noticed it in his solemn descriptions of evening or of night  " The wakeful bird  Sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid  Tunes her nocturnal note"  " The amorous bird of night  Sung spousal and bid haste the evening star  On his hilltop to light the bridal lamp"  Milton's Paradise Lost  The Nightingale is sometimes kept in cages Those reared from the

excited admiration in all ages we can say little language would but feebly express the variety and brilliance of colours that profusely adorn the plumes of this majestie creature  Peacocks were known three thousand years ago In the days of Solomon the  Tarshish fleet  of that monarch brought them to Jerusa∣lem In Greece they were also known very early at Athens they were highly prized It is supposed they were carried hence to  Samos  where they were preserved near the temple of Juno The epicures of Greece thought them a delicacy and the young Peafowl is esteemed among us It is said that when Alexander was in India he sound vast numbers on the banks of the  Hyarotis  and was so de∣lighted  with their beauty that he appointed a punishment for those who should kill any of themIt is also found in Africa  In our climate the Peacock does not come to its full plumage till the third year The female lays five or six greyish eggs the size of those of a Turkey the time of sitting is from twentyseven to thirty days The young are fed on barleymeal chopped leeks and curd the old ones on  wheat barley  c  It is an Italian proverb that the Peacock has the appearance of an angel and voice of the devil for its cry is exceedingly inharmonious In India it is related that they are taken by carrying lights to the trees where they roost and having painted representations of the bird presented to them at the same time when they put out the neck to look at the figure the sportsman slips the noose over their heads and secures them It is said also that the inhabitants of the

Ora  by Mr Latham Our specimen does not precisely agree with the de∣scription given by that author but the following considerations seem to justify our conclusion  The plumage of many Birds differ considerably in colours and markings in the various stages of their growth and even in the adult state we frequently observe varieties which it is difficult to refer to their true speciesFrom the general appearance of the Bird before us it has been thought the young of the common Tern and it stands for such in the Leverian Museum It cannot however be the young Bird of that species in the  contour  it is obviously different and the form of the beak with other striking peculiarities must certainly remove it from that species  Mr Latham in describing the Sandwich Tern says the back and wings are a pale hoary lead colour and in the young Birds are much clouded with brown he says also the head is much dotted with white in some specimens but observes that all Terns with black heads are liable to the same variation  In the adult common Tern the black of the head extends to the base of the bill in the Sandwich Tern the forehead is white  Thus far our specimen may be considered as the Sandwich Tern but the colour of the legs and claws of that Bird is uniformly said to be black while in ours they are orange this is however accidental and by no means a permanent character the orangecoloured legs and feet is strik∣ing but not invariable in the Common Tern as is proved by the variety  β  with black feet described by Mr Latham in the Index Ornithologicus  Sterna Hirundo  β

Duck The varieties in a tame state are endless but they uniformly pre∣serve one character by which we can trace them to this wild origin this is the short curled tail feathers of the Drakes which are con∣stant in all its varieties of plumage and the form of the bill in both sexes whether in a wild or domestic state  These birds are so well known that we bestow little attention on their beauty or we should consider the Mallard Drake the most beautiful of the webfooted birds that inhabit this country The plumage throughout is of singular richness and the various dotted streaks and lines on the plainer colours are uncommonly elegant The colours of the female as in other instances are more simple  Wild Ducks abound in this country but are no where more plenty than in the fens of Lincolnshire  In only ten decoys in the neighbourhood of  Wainfleet  thirtyone thousand two hundred have been taken in one season  British Zoology  The means of taking these birds are various and have been described with minuteness by many authors The method in common use in England is to set large decoy nets in the places they frequent and by means of a trained bird entice them into its labyrinths  The decoy nets are generally placed on a piece of water nearly surrounded with wood that the birds may not be frightened or disturbed They are so contrived that different pipes lead to it from several directions these pipes are so many avenues of network supported by hoops which become gradually narrower from the opening and lead up a ditch at the end of which the funnel net is placed Along these pipes at proper intervals are screens of reeds behind which the decoy man conceals himself from the birds The Ducks trained for decoys are fed on hemp seed which being light floats on the surface of the water When the evening sets in the decoy man throws some of the seeds from behind one of the screens to the trained bird this en∣tices him into the pipe and the wild fowl follow When they arrive at a certain part of the avenue the decoy bird dives under the water and the rest pass on till they enter the purse net where they are taken  Brit Zool c c  The inhabitants of other countries have also various and peculiar contrivances to entrap these and others of the water fowl These birds breed in marshy places and lay from ten to sixteen eggs Dr Latham says they are sometimes known to lay the eggs in a high tree in a deserted Magpie or Crow's nest and mentions an instance of one being sound at  Etchingham  in Sussex sitting upon nine eggs in an Oak twentyfive feet from the ground the eggs were supported by twigs laid crossways  Lath Gen Syn    Length of this species near two feet weight two pounds and an half  INDEX TO VOL V ARRANGEMENT ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM OF LINNAEUS  ORDER I
