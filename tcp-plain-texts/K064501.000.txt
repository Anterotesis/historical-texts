 REASONS FOR CONTENTMENT ADDRESSED TO  The Labouring Part  OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC  BY WILLIAM PALEY M A ARCHDEACON OF CARLISLE  CARLISLE  PRINTED BY F JOLLIE Price Twopence  REASONS FOR CONTENTMENT c  HUMAN life has been said to resemble the situation of spectators in a theatre where whilst each person is engaged by the scene which passes before him no one thinks about the place in which he is seated It is only when the business is interrupted or when the spectator's attention to it grows idle and remiss that he begins to consider at all who is before him or who is behind him whether others are better accommodated than himself or whether many be not much worse It is thus with the various ranks and stations of society So long as a man is intent upon the duties and concerns of his own condition he never thinks of comparing it with any other he is never troubled with reflections upon the different classes and orders of mankind the advantages or disadvantages of each the necessity or nonnecessity  of civil distinctions much less does he feel within himself a disposition to covet or envy any of them He is too much taken up with the occupations of his calling its pursuits cares and business to bestow unprofitable meditations upon the circumstances in which he sees others placed And by this means a man of a sound and active mind has in his very constitution a remedy against the disturbance of envy and discontent These passions gain no admittance into his breast because there is no leisure there or vacancy for the trains of thought which generate them He enjoys therefore ease in this respect and ease resulting from the best cause the power of keeping his imagination at home of consining it to what belongs to himself instead of sending it forth to wander amongst speculations which have neither limits nor use amidst views of unattainable grandeur fancied happiness of extolled because unexperienced privileges and delights  The wisest advice that can be given is never to allow our attention to dwell upon comparisons between our own condition and that of others but to keep it fixed upon the duties and concerns of the condition itself But since every man has not this power  since the minds of some men will be busy in contemplating the advantages which they see others possess and since persons in laborious stations of life are wont to view the higher ranks of society with sentiments which not only tend to make themselves unhappy but which are very different from the truth it may be an useful office to point out to them some of these considerations which if they  will  turn their thoughts to the subject they should endeavour to take fairly into the account  And first we are most of us apt to murmur when we see exorbitant fortunes placed in the hands of single persons larger we are sure than they can want or as we think than they can use This is so common a reflection that I will not say it is not natural But whenever the complaint comes into our minds we ought to recollect that the thing happens in consequence of those very rules and laws which secure to ourselves our property be it ever so small The laws which accidentally cast enormous estates into one great man's possession are after all the self same laws which protect and guard the poor man Fixed rules of property are established for one as well as another without knowing before hand whom they may  affect If these rules sometimes throw an excessive or disproportionate share to one man's lot who can help it It is much better that it should be so than that the rules themselves should be broken up and you can only have one side of the alternative or the other To abolish riches would not be to abolish poverty but on the contrary to leave it without protection or resource It is not for the poor man to repine at the effects of laws and rules by which he himself is benefited every hour of his existence which secure to him his earnings his habitation his bread his life without which he no more than the rich man could either eat his meal in quietness or go to bed in safety Of the two it is rather more the concern of the poor to stand up for the laws than of the rich for it is the law which defends the weak against the strong the humble against the powerful the little against the great and weak and strong humble and powerful little and great there would be even were there no laws whatever Beside what after all is the mischief The owner of a great estate does not eat or drink more than the owner of a small one His fields do not produce worse crops nor does the produce maintain fewer mouths If  estates were more equally divided would greater numbers be fed or clothed or employed Either therefore large fortunes are not a public evil or if they be in any degree an evil it is to be borne with for the sake of those fixed and general rules concerning property in the preservation and steadiness of which all are interested  Fortunes however of any kind from the nature of the thing can only fall to the lot of a few I say "from the nature of the thing" The very utmost that can be done by laws and government is to enable every man who hath health to procure a healthy subsistence for himself and a family Where this is the case things are at their perfection They have reached their limit Were the princes and nobility the legislators and counsellors of the land all of them the best and wisest men that ever lived their united virtue and wisdom could do no more than this They if any such there be who would teach you to expect more give you no instance where more has ever been attained  But Providence which foresaw which appointed indeed the necessity to which human affairs are subjected and against which it were impious to complain hath contrived  that whilst fortunes are only for a few the rest of mankind may be happy without them And this leads us to consider the comparative advantages and comforts which belong to the condition of those who subsist as the great mass of every people do and must subsist by personal labour and the solid reasons they have for contentment in their stations I do not now use the terms poor and rich because that man is to be accounted poor of whatever rank he be and suffers the pains of poverty whose expences exceed his resources and no man is properly speaking poor but he But I at present consider the advantages of those laborious conditions of life which compose the great portion of every human community  And first it is an inestimable blessing of such situations that they supply a constant train of employment both to body and mind A husbandman or a manufacturer or a tradesman never goes to bed at night without having his business to rise up to in the morning He would understand the value of this advantage did he know that the want of it composes one of the greatest plagues of the human soul a plague by which the rich especially those who inherit riches are exceedingly oppressed Indeed  it is to get rid of it that is to say it is to have something to do that they are driven upon those strange and unaccountable ways of passing their time in which we sometimes see them to our surprise engaged A poor man's condition supplies him with that which no man can do without and which a rich man with all his opportunities and all his contrivance can hardly supply himself regular engagement business to look forward to something to be done for every day some employment prepared for every morning A few of better judgement can seek out for themselves constant and useful occupation There is not one of you takes the pains in his calling which some of the most independent men in the nation have taken and are taking to promote what they deem to be a point of great concern to the interests of humanity by which neither they nor theirs can ever gain a shilling and in which should they succeed those who are to be benefited by their service will never know nor thank them for it I only mention this to show in conjunction with what has been observed above that of those who are at liberty to act as they please the wise prove and the foolish confess by their conduct that a life of employment is the only life worth leading  and that the chief difference between their manner of passing their time and yours is that they can chuse the objects of their activity which you cannot This privilege may be an advantage to some but for nine out of ten it is fortunate that occupation is provided to their hands that they have it not to seek that it is imposed upon them by their necessities and occasions for the consequence of liberty in this respect would be that lost in the perplexity of choosing they would sink into irrecoverable indolence inaction and unconcern into that vacancy and tiresomeness of time and thought which are inseparable from such a situation A man's thoughts must be going Whilst he is awake the working of his mind is as constant as the beating of his pulse He can no more stop the one than the other Hence if our thoughts have nothing to act upon they act upon ourselves They acquire a corrosive quality They become in the last degree irksome and tormenting Wherefore that sort of equable engagement which takes up the thoughts sufficiently yet so as to leave them capable of turning to any thing more important as occasions offer or require is a most invaluable blessing And if the industrious be not sensible of the blessing  it is for no other reason than because they have never experienced or rather suffered the want of it  Again some of the necessities which poverty if the condition of the labouring part of mankind must be so called imposes are not hardships but pleasures Frugality itself is a pleasure It is an exercise of attention and contrivance which whenever it is successful produces satisfaction The very care and forecast that are necessary to keep expences and earnings upon a level form when not embarrassed by too great difficulties are an agreeable engagement of the thoughts This is lost amidst abundance There is no pleasure in taking out of a large unmeasured fund They who do that and only that are the mere conveyors of money from one hand to another  A yet more serious advantage which persons in inferior stations possess is the case with which they provide for their children All the provision which a poor man's child requires is contained in two words "industry and innocence" With these qualities tho' without a shilling to set him forwards he goes into the world prepared to become an useful virtuous and happy man Nor will he fail to meet with a maintenance adequate to the habits with which he has  been brought up and to the expectations which he has formed a degree of success sufficient for a person of any condition whatever These qualities of industry and innocence which I repeat again are all that are absolutely necessary every parent can give to his children without expence because he can give them by his own authority and example and they are to be communicated I believe and preserved in no other way I call this a serious advantage of humble stations because in what we reckon superior ranks of life there is a real difficulty in placing children in situations which may in any degree support them in the class and in the habits in which they have been brought up with their parents from which great and oftentimes distressing perplexity the poor are free With health of body innocency of mind and habits of industry a poor man's child has nothing to be afraid of nor his father or mother any thing to be afraid of for him  The labour of the world is carried on by  service  that is by one man working under another man's direction I take it for granted that this is the best way of conducting business because all nations and ages have adopted it Consequently service  is the relation which of all others affects  he greatest number of individuals and in  he most sensible manner In whatever  ountry therefore this relation is well and  quitably regulated in that country the  oor will be happy Now how is the mat  er managed with us Except apprentice  hips the necessity of which every one at  east ever father and mother will acknow  edge as the best if not the only practicable way of gaining instruction and skill and which have their foundation in  nature  be  ause they have their foundation in the  atural  ignorance and imbecillity of youth  xcept these service in England is as it  ught to be voluntary and by contract a  air exchange of work for wage an equal  argain in which each party has his rights  nd his redress wherein every servant  huses his master Can this be mended I  ill add that a continuance of this connec  on is frequently the foundation of so much  utual kindness and attachment that very  ew friendships are more cordial or more  ncere that it leaves oftentimes nothing  servitude except the name nor any dis  nction but what one party is as much  eased with and sometimes also as proud  as the other  What then for this is the fair way of calculating is there in higher stations to place against these advantages What does the poor man see in the life or condition of the rich that should render him dissatisfied with his own  Was there as much in sensual pleasures▪ I mean in the luxuries of eating and drinking and other gratifications of that sort  some men's imaginations would represen  there to be but which no man's experience finds in them I contend that even in these respects the advantage is on the side of the poor The rich who addict themselves to indulgence lose their relish Their desire  are dead Their sensibilities are worn and tired Hence they lead a languid satiated existence Hardly any thing can amuse  rouse or gratify them Whereas the poo  man if something extraordinary fall in hi  way comes to the repast with appetite  pleased and refreshed derives from his usua  course of moderation and temperance  quickness of perception and delight which the unrestrained voluptuary knows nothing of Habits of all kinds are much the same▪ Whatever is habitual becomes smooth an  indifferent and nothing more The luxurious  receive no greater pleasures from their dainties than the peasant does from his homely fare But here is the difference The peasant whenever he goes abroad finds a feast whereas the epicure must be sumptuously entertained to escape disgust They who spend every day in diversions and they who go every day about their usual business pass their time much alike Attending to what they are about wanting nothing regretting nothing they are both whilst engaged in a state of ease but then whatever suspends the pursuits of the man of diversion distresses him whereas to the labourer or the man of business every pause is a recreation And this is a vast advantage which they possess who are trained and inured to a life of occupation above the man who sets up for a life of pleasure Variety is soon exhausted Novelty itself is no longer new A musements are become too familiar to delight and he is in a situation in which he can never change but for the worse  Another article which the poor are apt to envy in the rich is their  case  Now here they mistake the matter totally They call inaction ease whereas nothing is farther from it Rest is ease That is true But no man can rest who has not worked Rest is the  cessation of labour It cannot therefore be enjoyed or even tasted except by those who have known fatigue The rich see and not without envy the refreshment and pleasure which rest affords to the poor and chuse to wonder that they cannot find the same enjoyment in being free from the necessity of working at all They do not observe that this enjoyment must be purchased by previous labour and that he who will not pay the prices cannot have the gratification Being without work is one thing reposing from work is another The one is as tiresome and insipid as the other is sweet and soothing The one in general is the fate of the rich man the other is the fortune of the poor I have heard it said that if the face of happiness can any where be seen it is in the summer evening of a country village Where after the labours of the day each man at his door with his children amongst his neighbours feels his frame and his heart at rest every thing about him pleased and pleasing and a delight and complacency in his sensations far beyond what either luxury or diversion can afford The rich want this and they want what they must never have  As to some other things which the poor are disposed to envy in the condition of the  rich such as their state their appearance the grandeur of their houses dress equipage and attendance they only envy the rich these things because they do not know the rich They have not opportunities of observing with what neglect and insensibility the rich possess and regard these things themselves If they could see the great man in his retirement and in his actual manner of life they would find him if pleased at all taking pleasure in some of those simple enjoyments which they can command as well as he They would find him amongst his children in his husbandry in his garden pursuing some rural diversion or occupied with some trifling exercise which are all gratifications as much within the power and reach of the poor man as of the rich or rather more so  To learn the art of contentment is only to learn what happiness actually consists in Sensual pleasures add little to its substance Ease if by that be meant exemption from labour contributes nothing One however constant spring of satisfaction and almost infallible support of chearfulness and spirits is the exercise of domestic affections the presence of objects of tenderness and endearment in our families our kindred our  friends Now have the poor any thing to complain of here Are they not surrounded by their relatives as generally as others The poor man has his wife and children about him and what has the rich man more He has the same enjoyment of their society the same solicitude for their welfare the same pleasure in their good qualities improvement and success their connection with him is as strict and intimate their attachment as strong their gratitude as warm I have no propensity to envy any one least of all the rich and great but if I were disposed to this weakness the subject of my envy would be a healthy young man in full possession of his strength and faculties going forth in a morning to work for his wife and children or bringing them home his earnings at night  But was difference of rank or fortune of more importance to personal happiness than it is it would be ill purchased by any sudden or violent change of condition An alteration of circumstances which breaks up a man's habits of life deprives him of his occupation removes him from his acquaintance may be called an elevation of fortune but hardly ever brings with it an addition of enjoyment They to whom accidents  of this sort have happened never found them to answer their expectations After the first hurry of the change is over they are surprised to feel in themselves listlessness and dejection a consciousness of solitude vacancy and restraint in the place of chearfulness liberty and ease They try to make up for what they have lost sometimes by a beastly sottishness sometimes by a foolish dissipation sometimes by a stupid sloth all which effects are only so many confessions that changes of this sort were not made for man If any public disturbance should produce not an equality for that is not the proper name to give it but a jumble of ranks and professions amongst us it is not only evident what the rich would lose but there is also this further misfortune that what the rich lost the poor would not gain I God knows could not get my livelihood by labour nor would the labourer find any solace or enjoyment in my studies If we were to exchange conditions tomorrow all the effect would be that we both should be more miserable and the work of both be worse done Without debating therefore what might be very difficult to decide which of our two conditions was better to begin with one point is certain  that it is best for each to remain in his own The change and the only change to be desired is that gradual and progressive improvement of our circumstances which is the natural fruit of successful industry when each year is something better than the last when we are enabled to add to our little household one article after another of new comfort or conveniency as our profits increase or our burthen becomes less and what is best of all when we can afford as our strength declines to relax our labours or divide our cares This may be looked forward to and is practicable by great numbers in a state of public order and quiet it is absolutely impossible in any other  If in comparing the different conditions of social life we bring religion into the account the argument is still easier Religion smooths all inequalities because it unfolds a prospect which makes all earthly distinctions nothing And I do allow that there are many cases of sickness affliction and distress which Christianity alone can comfort But in estimating the mere diversities of station and civil condition I have not thought it necessary to introduce religion into the enquiry at all because I contend that the  man who murmurs and repines when he has nothing to murmur and repine about but the mere want of independent property is not only irreligious but ill founded and unreasonable in his complaint and that he would find did he know the truth and consider his case fairly that a life of labour such I mean as is led by the labouring part of mankind in this country has advantages in it which compensate all its inconveniencies When compared with the life of the rich it is better in these important respects It supplies employment it promotes activity It keeps the body in better health the mind more engaged and of course more quiet It is more sensible of ease more susceptible of pleasure It is attended with greater alacrity of spirits a more constant chearfulness and serenity of temper It affords easier and more certain methods of sending children into the world in situations suited to their habits and expectations It is free from many heavy anxieties which rich men feel it is fraught with many sources of delight which they want  If to these reasons for contentment the reflecting husbandman or artificer adds another very material one that changes of condition which are attended with a breaking  up and sacrifice of our ancient course and habit of living never can be productive of happiness he will perceive I trust that to covet the stations or fortunes of the rich or so however to covet them as to wish to seize them by force or through the medium of public uprore and confusion is not only wickedness but folly as mistaken in the end as in the means  that it is not only to venture out to sea in storm but to venture for nothing  FINIS
