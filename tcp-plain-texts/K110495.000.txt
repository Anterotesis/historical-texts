 A GENERAL VIEW OF THE WRITINGS OF LINNAEUS By RICHARD PULTENEY M D F R S  LONDON PRINTED FOR T PAYNE AT THE MEWSGATE AND B WHITE FLEETSTREET M DCC LXXXI  ADVERTISEMENT  AS the Writer of this volume could not for very obvious reasons entertain the most distant inten∣tion of standing forth the professed Biographer of LIN∣NAEUS he wishes to preclude any undue expectations by observing that the few memoirs relating to the life of this celebrated Professor which will be found inter∣spersed in the first part of this  View  were almost wholly collected from LINNAEUS'S own writings and other printed works and serve principally to relieve the tediousness of a bare account of books and to connect in a better man∣ner the series and occasion of his publications He re∣grets that his sources of intelligence have not been suf∣ficiently copious to enable him to render these memoirs more equal to his wishes and more worthy the accept∣ance of the public To those who are conversant with the works of LINNAEUS he is perfectly aware that these pages can afford but little amusement and still less in∣formation and can have no merit in their eye beyond that of recalling to their remembrance a succession of facts and observations with which they were before ac∣quainted They will however concur with him in wishing to diffuse the knowledge of the writings of so great a master and in endeavouring to excite an emula∣tion in younger minds for that science which they cul∣tivate  All the works of LINNAEUS as far as they have come to the Author's knowledge are noticed in the succeeding pages but as most of them were subservient to his great object the SYSTEM  of  NATURE the  outlines  of that work bear a principal part in this  View  of his writings  The CLASSIFICATION  of  DISEASES is but a small part of his works yet as LINNAEUS was an early writer  on that subject which has since excited the attention of many physicians and is at this day not sufficiently dis∣cussed it hath therefore been exhibited more largely than many of his other writings  The AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE although strictly speaking they are not LINNAEUS'S own works have yet so large a share of his authority stamped upon them are so intimately connected with his writings and it is pre∣sumed are so much less known than they deserve to be that it was judged proper to give a  brief  account of the  whole  collection  The PAN SUECUS having been first presented to the  English  reader several years ago by the Author of this vo∣lume in a periodical publication is here subjoined with additional observations and some improvements in the general arrangement of the tables  Few or no criticisms on the  Linnaean  system will be found in these pages No system yet invented can stand a rigorous examination through all its parts and LIN∣NAEUS was perhaps better acquainted than any other man with the defects of his own The study of nature on scientific principles notwithstanding the manifold improvements of later years may yet justly be considered as in its infancy and all arrangements hitherto proposed have in their turns given way to others At present the system of LINNAEUS possesses the advantage of a gene∣ral superiority in the public approbation how long it may enjoy this preeminence time only can discover in the mean while it would be a more agreeable employ∣ment to endeavour to strengthen its basis supply its de∣ficiences and candidly correct its errors than to  object  to those anomalies and imperfections which will most likely be ever inseparable from  artificial  arrangements and as to  natural  method it is as yet so far unknown that in the  vegetable  kingdom Botanists themselves are not agreed on what principles it ought to be established  A GENERAL VIEW OF THE WRITINGS OF THE LATE CELEBRATED LINNAEUS c  CHARLES VON LINNÈ the son of a  Swedish  divine was born May at  Roeshult  in the province of  Smaland  in  Sweden  of which place his father had the cure when this son was born but was soon after preferred to the living of  Stenbrihult  in the same province where dying in at the age of he was succeeded in his cure by another son We are told in the commemorationspeech on this celebrated man de∣livered in his  Swedish  majesty's presence before the royal academy of sciences at  Stockholm  that the ancestors of this family took their sirnames of LINNAEUS  Lindelius  and  Tiliander  from a large  limetree  or  lindentree  yet standing on the farm where  Linnaeus  was born and that this origin of sirnames taken from natural objects is not very uncommon in  Sweden  This eminent man whose talents enabled him to reform the whole science of natural history ac∣cumulated very early in life some of the highest honours that await the most successful proficients in medical science since we find that he was made  professor  of  physic  and  botany  in the university of  Upsal  at the age of and six years afterwards physician to his sovereign the late king  Adolphus  who in the year honoured him still farther by creating him knight of the order of the  Polar Star  His honours did not terminate here for in he was ennobled and in the present king of  Sweden  accepted the resignation of his office and rewarded his declining years by dou∣bling his pension and by a liberal donation of landed property settled on him and his family  It seems probable that his father's example first gave  Linnaeus  a taste for the study of nature who as he has himself informed us cultivated as his first amusement a garden plentifully stored with plants Young  Linnaeus  soon became acquainted with these as well as the indigenous ones of his neighbourhood Yet from the straightness of his father's income our young naturalist was on the point of being destined to a mechanical employ∣ment fortunately however this design was over∣ruled In he was sent to school at  Wexsio  where as his opportunities were enlarged his progress in all his favourite pursuits was propor∣tionably extended At this early period he paid attention to other branches of natural history par∣ticularly to the knowledge of insects in which as is manifest from his  oration  on the subject he must  very early have made a great proficiency since we find that he was not less successful herein than in that of plants having given them an arrangement and established such characters of distinction as have been universally followed by succeeding ento∣mologists  The first part of his academical education  Lin∣naeus  received under professor  Stobaeus  at  Lund  in  Scania  who favoured his inclinations to the study of natural history After a residence of about a year he removed in to  Upsal  Here he soon contracted a close friendship with  Artedi  a native of the province of  Angermannia  who had already been four years a student in that university and like himself had a strong bent to the study of na∣tural history in general but particularly to  Ich∣thyology  He was moreover well skilled in chemistry and not unacquainted with botany having been the inventor of that distinction in  umbelliferous  plants arising from the differences of the  involucrum  Emulation is the soul of improvement and heigh∣tened as it was in this instance by friendship proved a most powerful incentive These young men prosecuted their studies together with uncom∣mon vigor mutually communicating their observa∣tions and laying their plans so as to assist each other in every branch of natural history and physic  Soon after his residence at  Upsal  our author was also happy enough to obtain the favour of several gentlemen of established character in litera∣ture He was in a particular manner encouraged in the pursuit of his studies by the patronage of  Dr  Olaus Celsius  at that time professor of divinity and the restorer of natural history in  Sweden  since so distinguished for oriental learning and more particularly for his  Hierobotanicon  or  Critical Dis∣sertations on the Plants mentioned in Scripture  This gentleman is said to have given LINNAEUS a large share of his esteem and he was fortunate enough to obtain it very early after his removal to  Upsal  He was at that time meditating his  Hierobotanicon  and being struck with the diligence of  Linnaeus  in describing the plants of the  Upsal  garden and his extensive knowledge of their names fortunately for him at that time involved in difficulties from the narrow circumstances of his parents  Celsius  not only patronized him in a general way but admitted him to his house his table and his library Un∣der such encouragement it is not strange that our author made a rapid progress both in his studies and the esteem of the professors in fact we have a very striking proof of his merit and attainments inasmuch as we find that after only two years re∣sidence he was thought sufficiently qualified to give lectures occasionally from the botanic chair in the room of professor  Rudbeck  In the year the royal academy of sciences at  Upsal  having for some time meditated the design of improving the natural history of  Sweden  at the instance particularly of professors  Celsius  and  Rud∣beck  deputed LINNAEUS to make the tour of  Lap∣land  with the sole view of exploring the natural history of that arctic region to which underta∣king his reputation already high as a naturalist and the strength of his constitution equally re∣commended  him This tour had been made for the first time with the same view by the elder  Rudbeck  in at the command of  Charles  XI but unfortunately the whole fruit of that expedi∣tion except two or three copies of the  Campi Elysii  perished in the dreadful fire of  Upsal  in  As this expedition could not take place till the succeeding summer LINNAEUS spent his winter with his friends and relations in the south and particu∣larly paid a visit in January to his former preceptor  Stobaeus  at  Lund  whom he left in Fe∣bruary to visit his native province of  Smaland  and returned to  Upsal  about the middle of April to prepare for his journey He left  Upsal  the th of May and took his route to  Gevalia  or  Gevels  the principal town of  Gestricia  miles distant from  Upsal  Hence he travelled through  Helsingland  into  Medalpadia  where he made an excursion and as∣cended a remarkable mountain before he reached  Hudwickswald  the chief town of  Helsingland  From hence he went through  Angermanland  to  Hernosand  a seaport on the  Bothnic  gulph seventy miles dis∣tant from  Hudwickswald  When he had proceeded thus far he found it proper to retard his journey as the spring was not sufficiently advanced and took this opportunity of visiting those remarkable caverns on the summit of mount  Skula  though at the hazard of his life  When LINNAEUS arrived at  Uma  in  West Bothnia  about miles from  Hernosand  he quitted the public road and took his course through the woods westward in order first to traverse the most southern parts of  Lapland  Being now come to  the country that was more particularly the object of his enquiries equally a stranger to the language and to the manners of the people and without any associate he committed himself to the hospi∣tality of the inhabitants and never failed to expe∣rience it fully He speaks in several places with peculiar satisfaction of the innocence and simpli∣city of their lives and their freedom from diseases In this excursion he reached the mountains to∣wards  Norway  and after encountering great hard∣ships returned into  West Bothnia  quite exhausted with fatigue He seems to have been much struck with the singular use that the  Laplanders  make of the  Pinguicula vulgaris  which we call  Butterwort  or Yorkshire Sanicle They receive the milk of the reindeer upon the fresh leaves of this plant which they immediately strain off and set aside till it becomes somewhat acescent and the whole ac∣quires in a day or two a consistence equal to that of cream without separating the serum and by this method it becomes an agreeable food When thus prepared a small quantity of the same has the property of rennet in producing the like change on fresh milk But to return Our tra∣veller next visited  Pitha  and  Lula  upon the gulph of  Bothnia  from which latter place he took again a western route by proceeding up the river of that name and visited the ruins of the temple of  Jock∣mock  in  LulaLapland  or  LapMark  thence he tra∣versed what is called the  Lapland Desert  destitute of all villages cultivation roads or any conve∣niences inhabited only by a few straggling people originally descended from the  Finlanders  and who  settled in this country in remote ages being en∣tirely a distinct people from the  Laplanders  In this district he ascended a noted mountain called  Wallevari  in speaking of which he has given us a pleasant relation of his finding a singular and beautiful new plant  Andromeda tetragona  when travelling within the arctic circle with the sun in his view at midnight in search of a  Lapland  hut From hence he crossed the  Lapland Alps  into  Finmark  and traverfed the shores of the North sea as far as  Sallero  These journies from  Lula  and  Pitha  on the  Bothnian  gulph to the north shore were made on foot and our traveller was attended by two  Lap∣landers  one his interpreter and the other his guide He tells us that the vigour and strength of these two men both old and sufficiently loaded with his baggage excited his admiration since they appeared quite unhurt by their labour while he himself although young and robust was fre∣quently quite exhausted In this journey he was wont to sleep under the boat with which they forded the rivers as a defence against rain and the gnats which in the  Lapland  summer are not less teazing than in the torrid zones In de∣scending one of these rivers he narrowly escaped perishing by the oversetting of the boat and lost many of the natural productions which he had collected  LINNAEUS thus spent the greater part of the summer in examining this arctic region and those mountains on which four years afterwards the  French philosophers secured immortal fame to Sir  Isaac Newton  At length after having suffered incredible fatigues and hardships in climbing pre∣cipices passing rivers in miserable boats suffering repeated vicissitudes of extreme heat and cold and not unfrequently hunger and thirst he re∣turned to  Tornoa  in September He did not take the same route from  Tornoa  as when he came into  Lapland  having determined to visit and examine the country on the eastern side of the  Bothnian  gulph his first stage therefore was to  Ula  in  East Bothnia  from thence to  Old  and  New Carleby  miles south from  Ula  He continued his route through  Wasa Christianstedi  and  Biorneburgh  to  Abo  a small university in  Fin∣land  Winter was now setting in apace he there∣fore crossed the gulph by the island of  Aland  and arrived at  Upsal  in November after having per∣formed and that mostly on foot a journey of ten degrees of latitude in extent exclusive of those de∣viations which such a design rendered necessary  The  result  of this journey was not published till several years afterwards during his residence in  Holland  For the present he only gave in to the academy a  Florula Lapponica  consisting of a very few pages in the  Acta Upsaliensia  for the years and In this little catalogue the plants are disposed according to the system which was after∣wards called the  sexual  and which we should not have mentioned here but to prove how early  Lin∣naeus  had laid the foundation of that method which he afterwards wrought up to such perfection  In he visited and examined the several mines in  Sweden  and made himself so well ac∣quainted with  mineralogy  and the  docimastic  art that we find he was sufficiently qualified to give lectures on those subjects upon his return to the university The outlines of his system on mi∣neralogy appeared in the early editions of the  Systema Naturae  but he did not exemplify the whole until the year  In the year LINNAEUS was sent by Baron  Reuterholm  governor of  Dalekarlia  with several other naturalists into that province to investigate the natural productions of that part of the  Swedish  dominions Each gentleman had his particular department assigned and they noted daily the ob∣servations made relating to geography c but particularly and as their principal object the eco∣nomical and natural history and mineralogy A full account of these observations was intended to have been published but the design was laid aside It was in this journey that our author firft laid the plan of an excellent institution which was after∣wards executed in a certain degree at least by himself with the assistance of many of his pupils and the result published under the title of  Pan Suecus  in the second volume of the  Amaenitates Academicae  After the completion of this expedition it ap∣pears that LINNAEUS resided for a time at  Fahlun  the principal town in  Dalekarlia  where he tells us that he taught  mineralogy  and the  docimastic  art and practised physic and where he was very hospitably treated by Dr  More  the physician of  the place It also appears that he contracted at this time an intimacy with one of that gentleman's daughters whom he married about five years afterwards upon his settling as a  physician  at  Stock∣holm  In this journey he extended his travels quite across the  Dalekarlian Alps  into  Norway  but we have no particular account of his discoveries in that kingdom From its situation however in the same parallels of latitude and of longitude nearly with  Sweden  as well as from the face of the country but little variety could be expected and from the  Flora Norwegica  of Bp  Gunner  since published the vegetable productions of na∣ture appear to be nearly the same except that the  Norway  coast abounds with  fuci  or seawracks not known in the  Baltic  In the year LINNAEUS travelled over many other parts of  Sweden  some parts of  Denmark  and  Germany  and fixed in  Holland  where he chiefly resided until his return to  Stockholm  about the year He here took his doctor's degree in physic in June How clearly the great  Boerhaave  saw his merit will appear hereafter On the present occasion he sustained a  thesis  under the title of HYPOTHESIS NOVA  de febrium inter∣mittentium causa  It is an enquiry into the causes of the frequency of that distemper in  Sweden  particularly in  Upland  and the southeast parts of that kingdom which he was inclined to attribute to a  local  cause after the most minute scrutiny into the soil and situation of those places where this distemper was so remarkably prevalent and  obstinate and finally proposes Whether it might not be owing to the strong impreg∣nation of the water with  argillaceous  particles Whether or not he afterwards adhered to this opinion we are uncertain as it is but justice to observe that he did not republish this tract himself since it was placed at the head of the first volume of the  Amaenitates  printed at  Ley∣den  as we believe without his knowledge by Dr  Peter Camper  In the mean time we may observe that howsoever insufficient this  hypothesis  may be to solve the difficulties that have at∣tended the search into the remote causes of this disease the advocates of the modern theory re∣lating to it may think the author's facts of its frequency in  low  situations confirm and illustrate in no small degree their own according to which it is imputed to  miasmata  arising from moist and marshy ground  In this year LINNAEUS also published the first sketch of his  Systema Naturae  in a very com∣pendious way and in the form of tables only in twelve pages  in folio  By this it appears that he had at a very early period of his life cer∣tainly before he was years old laid the basis of that great structure which he afterwards raised not only to the increase of his own fame but to that of natural science  In LINNAEUS came into  England  and vi∣sited Dr  Dillenius  the late learned professor at  Oxford  whom he justly considered as one of the first botanists in  Europe  He mentions with par∣ticular respect the civilities he received from him  and the privileges he gave him of inspecting his own and the  Sherardian  collections of plants It is needless to say that he visited Dr  Martyn  Mr  Rand  and Mr  Miller  and that he was in a more singular manner indebted to the friendship of Dr  Isaac Lawson  He also  contracted an intimate friendship with Mr PETER COLLINSON which was reciprocally increased by a multitude of good offices and continued to the last without any diminution  Dr  Boerhaave  had furnished him with letters to our great naturalist Sir HANS SLOANE but it is with regret that we must ob∣serve they did not procure him the reception which the warmth of his recommendation seemed to claim  Dr  Boerhaave  's letter to Sir  Hans Sloane  on this occasion is preserved in the British Museum and runs thus  LINNAEUS  qui has tibi dabit literas est unice dignus te videre unice dignus a te videri qui vos videbit simul videhit hominum par cui simile vix dabit orbis  This encomium howsoever quaintly expressed yet was in some measure pro∣phetic of  Linnaeus  's future fame and greatness and proves how intimately  Boerhaave  had penetrated into the genius and abilities of our author and strained as this parallel might be thought it is likely however that the opening of the  sexual  system so different from  Ray's  by which Sir  Hans Sloane  had always known plants and particularly the in∣novations as they were then called which LIN∣NAEUS had made in altering the names of so many  genera  were rather the cause of that coolness with which he was received by our excellent naturalist  Probably we have reason to regret this circum∣stance for otherwise LINNAEUS might have obtained an establishment in  England  as it has been thought he wished to have done and doubtless his op∣portunities in this kingdom would have been much more favourable to his designs than in those arctic regions where he spent the remainder of his days In the mean time we may justly infer the exalted idea that  Linnaeus  had of  England  as a land eminently favourable to the improvement of science from that compliment which in a letter to a friend he after∣wards paid to  London  when speaking of that city he called it  "Punctum saliens in vitello orbis"  However the  English  naturalists may now con∣gratulate themselves on having adopted a most excellent disciple of the  Linnaean  school who with an illustrious associate shared the perils of a navigation round this globe incited by thirst of knowledge alone and who now enjoys that general esteem among us which is due to his extensive science and to his singular liberality of mind and manners  One of the most agreeable circumstances that happened to LINNAEUS during his residence in  Holland  arose from the patronage of Mr  Clifford  in whose house  The country seat and garden of Mr  Clifford  was at  Hartcamp  about three miles from  Haerlem  he lived a considerable part of his time being now as it were the child of fortune  Exivi patriâ triginta sex nummis aureis dives  are his own words With Mr  Clifford  however he enjoyed pleasures and privileges scarcely at that time to be met with elsewhere in the world that of a garden excellently stored with the finest exotics and a library furnished with almost every botanic author of note How happy he found himself in this situation those only who have felt the same kind of ardour can conceive  Whilst in  Holland  our author was recom∣mended by  Boerhaave  to fill the place then va∣cant of physician to the  Dutch  settlement at  Suri∣nam  but he declined it on account of his hav∣ing been educated in so opposite a climate He recommended however to that department a young German physician of great merit who had the misfortune to fall a sacrifice partly to the climate and partly perhaps to ill usage from the governor in half a year after his arrival A circumstance which LINNAEUS has very pathe∣tically lamented in the  Flora Suecica  N  o  when treating of a plant to which he has given this gentleman's name  Besides being favoured with the particular patronage and friendship of  Boerhaave  and Mr  Clifford  as is abovementioned our author had also the pleasure of being contemporary with and of reckoning among the number of his friends many other learned persons who have since proved orna∣ments to their profession and whose merit has most deservedly raised them to fame and honour Among these we may properly mention Dr  John Burman  professor of botany at  Amsterdam  whose name and family are well known in the republic of  letters to whom our author dedicated his  Biblio∣theca Botanica  having been greatly assisted in com∣piling that work by the free access he had to that gentleman's excellent library  John Frederick Grono∣vius  of  Leyden  editor of  Clayton's Flora Virginica  and who very early adopted  Linnaeus  's system Baron  Van Swieten  late physician to the Empress Queen  Isaac Lawson  beforementioned after∣wards one of the physicians to the British army who died much regretted at  Oosterhout  in the year and from whom  Linnaeus  received singular and very important civilities  Kramer  since well known for an excellent treatise on the Doci∣mastic Art  Van Royen  botanic professor at  Leyden Liëberkun  of  Berlin  famous for his skill in microscopical instruments and experiments On this occasion it is not foreign to our plan to remark that LINNAEUS being present with several of these gentlemen at a meeting when the latter was exhibiting the animalcules  in semine masculino  openly declared his opinion that these  moleculae  were not true animalcules and he appears ever afterwards to have retained the same opinion re∣lating to them To these may be added also the names of  Albinus  and  Gaubius  and of others were it requisite to shew that our author's talents had very early rendered him conspicuous and gained him the regard of all those who cultivated and patronized any branch of medical science and to which doubtless the singular notice with which  Boerhaave  honoured him did not a little contri∣bute  Early in the year after LINNAEUS had left  Mr  Clifford  and as it should seem when he re∣sided with  Van Royen  at  Leyden  he had a long and dangerous fit of sickness and upon his re∣covery went to  Paris  where he was properly entertained by the  Jussieu's  at that time the first botanists in  France  The opportunity this gave him of inspecting the Herbaria of  Surian  and  Tour∣nefort  and those of the abovenamed gentlemen afforded him great satisfaction He had intended to have gone from thence into  Germany  to visit  Ludwig  and the celebrated HALLER with whom he was in close correspondence but he was not able to compleat this part of his intended route and was obliged to return without this gratification  Our author did not fail to avail himself of every advantage that access to the several museums of this country afforded him in every branch of natural history and the number and importance of his publications during this absence from his native country sufficiently demonstrate that fund of knowledge which he must have imbibed before and no less testify his extraordinary application As these works laid the foundation of his future fame and distinguished character it will be incum∣bent on us to enumerate them and give a brief account of each as nearly as we can in the order of time in which they were published before we accompany our author into  Sweden  whither he returned to receive at length the reward of his merit  The first of these was the SYSTEMA NATURAE  five regna tria Naturae systematicè proposita per  classes ordines genera et species  Lugd Bat fol pp in Latin with the  Swedish  names annexed As this is little more than the general  outlines  of his work we shall reserve a fuller account of it till we come to the enlarged editions in which it was fully exemplified by the introduction of the  species  FUNDAMENTA BOTANICA  quae majorum operum prodromi instar theoriam Scientiae Botanices per breves Aphorismos tradunt Amst    o  pp The science of botany is in this work reduced to aphorisms or canons and what  Sethus Calvisius  has said of  Ptolemy  's canon  mutatis mutandis  may be truly said of this work  Omni auro pretiosior est si dudum innotuisset nec adeo in diversas sectas  BOTA∣NICI  abiisent sed  RES BOTANICAE  multo melius se haberent  It passed through several editions and was published with a comment upon each aphorism in under the title of  Philosophia Botanica  hereafter to be noticed  BIBLIOTHECA BOTANICA  recensens libros plus mille de plantis hucusque

are in this work distributed into classes and it is by no means so unentertaining as might be expected from the general idea of a catalogue merely as the author has frequently subjoined short characters of the books and at the beginning of each class as also in the orders or subdivisions takes occasion to ex∣plain several of his terms used in his subsequent  writings The preface contains a short history of the rise and progress of botany and an acknow∣ledgment of the aid the author received in the compilation of this work by his free access to the libraries of Mr  Sprekelsen  at  Hamburgh  Dr  Gro∣novius  at  Leyden  and particularly to those of his patron Mr  Clifford  and Dr  Burman  professor of botany at  Amsterdam  Authors are classed in this work as follows    Patres

Anomali  Subjoined to the last edition we have a biogra∣phical table exhibiting in chronological order the names of botanic authors from the time of  Avicenna  in to Mr  Catesby  in specifying

is drawn up with the utmost precision ac∣cording to the author's own  Methodus Demonstrandi  printed at the end of the  Systema  and is a model for  Monographers  in this way It is embellished with two plates one representing the plant at large the other the parts of fructification separately  GENERA PLANTARUM  eorumque Characteres na∣turales secundum numerum figuram situm et proportio∣nem omnium fructificationis partium  Lugd Bat  o  pp In this work which exhibits what LINNAEUS has called the  natural characters  of the  genera  of plants the  classes  are established upon the  number  or  situation  or both conjointly of the  stamina  analogically considered as the male parts and the  orders  or subdivisions of the classes upon the  pistils  analogous to the female parts and the  genera  themselves from the agreement of all the parts of fructification compared with each other as they agree in  number figure situation  and  pro∣portion  Hence the  Linnaean characters  of plants are applicable to any classical method founded on the parts of fructification alone in which respect they have the advantage over those of all foregoing writers and will probably stand firm even al∣though the  classical  part of the system should be set aside This is to be considered as one of the capital of  Linnaeus  's works He tells us that before the publication of the first edition he had examined the characters of flowers Those alone who have been accustomed to examine plants with a scientific view can judge how arduous this undertaking must have been and how great the application that he must necessarily have bestowed thereon and that at an early period of life Neither can any others sufficiently admire that accuracy with which  so great a number of flowers  have been  examined and compared or see the aptitude of that assem∣blage of terms which were invented by LINNAEUS to express the different  figure situation  and  pro∣portion  that exist in such a variety of subjects If this was a proper place to expatiate upon this sub∣ject by extending the idea to all that LINNAEUS has done respecting every other part of plants as considered in their  specific  distinctions it must still farther exalt the merit of the author and place him above all praise At the latter end of this work was given the general plan of a system invented by LINNAEUS and founded upon the different  kinds  and  arrangement  of the  calix  or cup of the flower in plants but this was omitted in the lat∣ter editions Also a fragment of that  primum et ultimum  in botany the  natural method  The first edition of this book contained  genera  the sixth and last at  Stockholm  in hath extended the number to and the  Mantissae  since to It has been thought by some that the first idea of the  sexual  me∣thod was received from the writings of  Jungius  a learned professor first at  Helmstadt  and after∣wards  rector  of the Gymnasium at  Hamburgh  where he died in and whose works contain an uncommon display of original observations on the subject of plants and prove him to have been a most accurate observer of nature He has not only discriminated with peculiar nicety the struc∣ture and several parts of plants but he hath also with equal judgment shewn the impropriety of many of the old generical and specifical distinc∣tions  and has given rules for forming them anew that have been of the greatest service to his suc∣cessors in the science and of which they have not failed to avail themselves But  Jungius  did not however exhibit any plan by which it appears that he laid the basis either of the sexual or any other system  Before the conclusion of the same year our author published the COROLLARIUM GENERUM  cui accedit  METHODUS SEXUALIS in  o  the for∣mer contained only the addition of sixty new genera of plants all which were taken into the next edition of the foregoing book and the latter ex∣hibits a brief view of the sexual system as far as respects the  classes  and  orders  Neither would it be of importance to mention a small piece published in the same year during his residence with Mr  Clif∣ford  under the title of VIRIDARIUM CLIFFORTIA∣NUM were it not incumbent on us to mention all that came from our author's pen  In this year appeared likewise the result of the  Lapland  expedition as far at least as re∣lates to the plants of that country for we are now deprived of the expectation of ever seeing the  Lachesis Lapponica  intended to complete our au∣thor's history of this country through all its parts This volume

by ad∣ditional  Prolegomena  in which the  geographic  and  natural  description of the country is set forth and the difference between the  Alps  and the  Desart  dis∣tinctly marked concluding with some observations on  alpine  plants in general The work is interspersed with many very curious observations relating to the inhabitants their simplicity of life and man∣ners their diseases the animals of the country the medical and economical uses of many of the plants descriptions at large of such as were not well described before and critical observations in a botanical way upon others  To instance briefly a few only of our author's observations Under  N  o  The dropsy very frequent in  East Both∣nia  owing to the intemperate use of spirits  N  o  The down of the  Cotton Grass  used for bedding among the poor instead of feathers  N  o  Astonishing growth of the  Great Plantain  The spikes or feet high In other situations the whole plant not an inch  N  o  The wretched inhabitants sometimes obliged to make bread of the roots of the  Marsh  Trefoil  The scurvy unknown in  Lapland  although vegetable productions have scarcely any share in the  Lapland  diet which is almost wholly the recent flesh of the reindeer a fact which Sir  John Pringle  has made good use of among others in his dis∣course "On the means of preserving the health of "mariners"  N  o  Symptoms of the  Colica Lapponica  Sauvag Nosol II p a most excruciating disease for which the  Laplanders  use the root of  Angelica  N  o  The deleterious effects of the  Cicuta virosa  Water Hemlock largely discussed  N  o  The pernicious effects of the  Anthericum ossifragum  Lancashire Asphodel on sheep  N  o  Manifold uses of the black and red Whortleberries and Cranberries  N  o  Various economical uses of the  Andro∣meda polifolia  Marsn Cistus  N  o  Observations on the gout whether owing to the use of spirituous and fermented liquors Reflections on the health and vigour of the  Lap∣landers  N  o  The  Achillaea Millefolium  Yarrow used sometimes in  Dalekarlia  instead of  hops  and said to render the drink very intoxicating  N  o  Singular economical uses of the  Carices  or Sedges amongst the  Laplanders  N  o  Uses of the  Birchtree  and the  Dwarf Birch  beyond almost all others The thick woods of this tree frequently set on fire by light∣ning and consumed for miles  Moxa  of the  Lap∣landers  prepared from a part of this tree their universal remedy in painful diseases  N  o  The leaves of  Sparganium natans  Bur∣reed preferred by horned cattle and horses to other grass Observations on the immense number of  Water Fowl  and  Waders  in  Lapland  and on their migration  N  o  Uses of the  Polytrichum commune  or Golden Maidenhair and N  o  those of the  Sphagnum Palustre  or BogMoss among the  Lap∣land  women to which he has annexed some curious observations relating to the state of the menstrual evacuations in the sex in those northern regions  N  o  Observations on the reindeer and their food the  Lichen rangiferinus  N  o  On the  Lichen islandicus  on which M  Scopoli  has of late written largely  N  o  In treating on the Agarics he recites the baneful effects of the  Oestrus Tarandi  Gadfly on the whole economy of the reindeer More largely discussed in the  Amoenitates  But to re∣turn  In this work moreover our author has first exemplified what he ever afterwards laboured to bring to its greatest perfection in all his writings and particularly in the  Species Plantarum  a work not published till sixteen years afterwards  the spe∣cific names of plants  not taken as had been custom∣ary with former authors from the colour of the flower relative size of the plant smell taste place of growth time of flowering name of the dis∣coverer virtues uses duration none of which are  sufficiently permanent but from those invariable and essential parts which fully and clearly distin∣guish each species under the same genus and in the compass of ten or twelve words convey such an idea of the plant intended as will more effec∣tually distinguish it than the  verbose descriptions  of many foregoing authors LINNAEUS has taken in∣credible pains with this part of his system which is certainly as difficult as any that leads to the perfection of the science since it depends upon a nice inspection of  every species  belonging to each  genus  and of every  actual variety  belonging to each  species  The plants of  Lapland  are but few not amount∣ing to more than species and in this number are included upwards of an hundred discovered by  Linnaeus  in this journey not known to be natives of  Sweden  before and of which some were non∣descripts among the former there seems to be a propriety in mentioning specially the  Campanula serpyllifolia  or thymeleaved Bellflower which as it turned out to be a new  genus  was appropriated to our author by Dr  J Gronovius  and engraved in this volume by the name of LINNAEA  No part of LINNAEUS'S writings had given more offence to the contemporary botanists than the liberty he had taken in changing the  generic names  of plants which had necessarily taken place in many instances from the rules established by the  Fundamenta  Even DILLENIUS was by no means reconciled to this innovation LINNAEUS who had entertained an high opinion of our  English  pro∣fessor having said of him  nullus est in Anglia qui  genera curat vel intelligit praeterquam Dillenius  probably therefore dedicated to him his next publication the CRITICA BOTANICA  in qua No∣mina Plantarum generica et specifica et variantia exa∣mini subjiciuntur selectiora confirmantur indigna re∣jiciuntur simulque doctrina circa Denominationem Plan∣tarum traditur  Lugd Bat  o  pp This is a large comment upon the th th th and th parts of the  Fundamenta  from Aphorism to inclusive in which he has amply explained all his reasons for these alterations and there were at that time many who saw the justice of his remarks  Ludwig  says when speaking of this work  "rigo∣rosus quidem sed saepissime faelix botanicorum censor est"  The work is rendered very applicable to use by two excellent indexes  LINNAEUS printed at the end of this volume  Discursus de introducenda in scholas et gymnasia Histo∣riae naturalis lectione  pp written by Dr  Bro∣wallius  who afterwards defended very ably the system of  Linnaeus  against professor  Siegesbeck  of  Petersburgh  In was likewise published the most splendid of all our author's writings the  Hortus Cliffortianus Plantas exhibens quas in Hortis tam vivis quam siccis Hartecampi in Hollandia coluit Vir Nob et Gen Geor∣gius Clifford J U D reductis varietatibus ad species speciebus ad genera generibus ad classes adjectis locis plantarum natalibus differentiisque specierum  Amst fol pp t As this book was printed at the expence of Mr  Clifford  it is orna∣mented with an elegant frontispiece and adorned with some of the finest engravings of plants that  are extant the drawings for which were made with all possible accuracy by the late Mr  Ehret  By the munificence of Mr  Clifford  many of the cele∣brated botanists received a present of this book How rich this garden was in plants the book will testify They are arranged as in all our author's succeeding works in the sexual method the varie∣ties are reduced to their several species the natural places of the plants are particularly noticed many new  genera  and  species  under former genera are introduced with their descriptions at large and curious observations interspersed throughout the whole And what must have been more especi∣ally acceptable to those who began to relish our author's system was the farther exemplification of his  specific characters  which the vast number of plants included in this work necessarily led to Add to this that from the copious number of synonyms it is almost a  pinax  of every plant therein mentioned and on this account as well as others will yet retain its value though superseded in a great degree by the  Species Plantarum  To the curious and critical botanist also it is no small satisfaction now to see in this volume compared with later works the progress of the author's own knowledge manifest by the removes and altera∣tions that better information enabled him to make In the dedication our author enumerates those patrons who have cultivated botanical gar∣dens so greatly to the emolument of the science he gives a list of the  Cliffortian  library and an∣nexes two tables with explanations of all the variety of leaves according to his new method  of defining them This addition was very neces∣sary as the number of plants synonymed in this volume amounts to near We conclude with  Gesner's  opinion of this work in a letter to the celebrated  Haller  Opus sane egregium et acerrimi judicii nec minoris eruditionis quo dif∣ficulter botanicus carebitMihi perplacet ab eo in nominibus specierum notas earum essentiales exhiberi quod ante vix quisquam botanicus recte praestitit  The last book which LINNAEUS published of his own during his stay in  Holland  was the CLASSES PLANTARUM  seu Systemata Plantarum om∣nia a fructificatione desumta quorum    universalia et    partialia compendiose proposita secundum classes ordines et nomina generica cum clave cujusvis methodi et synonymis genericis  Lugd Bat pp This work is a very large illustration of the second part of the  Fundamenta  from aphorism to and contains a compendious and useful view of all the systems of botany or methods of classing plants both general and partial from  Caesalpinus  in who is considered as the inventor to LINNAEUS himself in To the generical name in every system he has added that by which it stands in his own which is a great advantage in the use of this book A new edition with the requisite additions would be very acceptable to the public even now The systems at large that are displayed in this book are those of  Caesal∣pinus Morison Ray Knaut Herman  and  Boerhaave  founded on the fruit  Rivinus Ruppius Ludwig  and  Knaut  on the number of petals in the flower  Tournefort  and  Pontedera  on the figure of the  same and of  Magnol  and LINNAEUS on the cup of the flower After these follow LINNAEUS'S sexual system and his fragments of the natural method We say nothing of the arrangement of  particular  classes such are the  composite  flowers the  umbelliferous  plants the  graminaceous  the  ferns  c A very large index referring to every  genus  in each system concludes the volume  LINNAEUS whilst in  Holland  sustained a very severe loss in the premature death of his friend and fellow student  Artedi  with whom as has been before observed he had contracted the firmest friendship whilst they resided at  Upsal  insomuch that they had in case of death mutually be∣queathed to each other their manuscripts and collections in natural history  Artedi  had been particularly assiduous in arranging anew and describing all such fishes as had fallen under his own inspection and had taken a voyage to  Eng∣land  in to give more perfection to his plan Our author after his death procured though with some difficulty all  Artedi  's papers and put the finishing hand to them and published them at  Leyden  in in octavo under the title of  Petri Artedi Sueci Medici  ICHTHYOLOGIA  sive opera omnia de piscibus scilicet Bibliotheca Ichthyo∣logica Philosophia Ichthyologica Genera Piscium Synonymia Specierum Descriptiones Specierum Om∣nia in hoc genere perfectiora quam antea ulla Post∣huma vindicavit recognovit cooptavit et edidit Caro∣lus  LINNAEUS In this work fishes are arranged in an entire new method and which our author adopted with little or no variation and continued  through all the former editions of his  System  to the tenth when he removed the  cetaceous  order into the class of the  mammalia  and instead of re∣taining in the remaining orders the distinctions arising from the  bony  or  cartilaginous  texture of the  fins  he established them on the  situation  of the  ventral fins  which he considers as analogous to the feet in other animals as they are placed either before underneath or behind the  pectoral fins  In this work  Artedi  has exhibited an instance of genius labour and application that cannot fail to excite the greatest regret at his early death He has given to  Ichthyology  that degree of perfec∣tion which his friend afterwards extended through all the animal kingdom and which must remain a lasting monument of his abilities In parti∣cular his descriptions of the indigenous fishes of  Sweden  are scientific to a degree that had never before been seen and we cannot sufficiently ad∣mire the pains he must have taken to extricate the synonyms from every author on the subject  Artedi  after his return from  England  was re∣tained at the recommendation of LINNAEUS by  Seba  of  Amsterdam  to complete that part of his  Thesaurus  relating to fishes and was unfortunately drowned in one of the canals in that city LIN∣NAEUS in a short account of the author's life has lamented his untimely decease in a manner which does no less honour to his friend than to his own feelings  We must now accompany our author into  Sweden  whither he returned about the latter end  of the year or the beginning of the next and settled as a physician at  Stockholm  where he seems to have met with considerable opposition and was oppressed with many difficulties all of which at length he overcame and got into ex∣tensive practice and soon after his settlement married the lady before spoken of By the interest of Count  Tessin  who was afterwards his great patron and even procured medals to be struck in honour of him he obtained the rank of physician to the fleet and a stipend from the citizens for giving lectures in botany And what at this time especially was highly favourable to the advancement of his character and fame by giving him an opportunity of displaying his abilities was the establishment of the  Royal Academy of Sciences  at  Stockholm  of which LIN∣NAEUS was constituted the first president and to which establishment the king granted several pri∣vileges particularly that of free postage to all pa∣pers directed to the secretary By the rules of the academy the president held his place but three months at the expiration of which he made his ORATIO  de memorabilibus in Insectis  Oct in which he endeavours to excite an atten∣tion and enquiry into the knowledge of insects by displaying the many singular  phaenomena  that occur in contemplating the nature of those animals and by pointing out in a variety of instances their usefulness to mankind in particular and to the economy of nature in general  During all this time however LINNAEUS appears to have had his eye upon the botanic and medical  chair at  Upsal  at this time occupied by  Rudbeck  who was far advanced in life We learn in∣deed that he was so intent on pursuing and per∣fecting his great designs in the advancement of his favourite study of nature that he had deter∣mined if he failed in procuring the professorship at  Upsal  to accept the offer that had been made to him by  Haller  of filling the botanic chair at  Gottingen  However in course of time he obtained his wish In the year upon the re∣signation of  Roberg  he was constituted joint pro∣fessor of physic and physician to the king with  Rosen  who had been appointed in the preceding year on the death of  Rudbeck  These two col∣leagues agreed to divide the medical departments between them and their choice was confirmed by the university  Rosen  took anatomy physiology pathology and the therapeutic part LINNAEUS natural history botany  materia medica  the dietetic part and the  diagnosis morborum  During the interval of his removal from  Stock∣holm  to  Upsal  in consequence of this appointment our professor was deputed by the states of the kingdom to make a tour to the islands of  Oëland  and  Gothland  in the  Baltic  attended by six of the pupils commissioned to make such enquiries as might tend to improve agriculture and arts in the kingdom to which the  Swedish  nation had for some time paid a particular attention awakened as it were by the desolating wars of  Charles  the XIIth to extend their commerce and cultivate the arts of peace The result of this journey was very successful and proved fully satisfactory to  the States and was afterwards communicated to the public  LINNAEUS on his return entered upon the pro∣fessorship and pronounced before the university his ORATION  de Peregrinationum intra Patriam neces∣sitate  Oct in which he forcibly displays the usefulness of such excursions by pointing out to the students that vast field of objects which their country held out to their cultivation whether in geography physics mineralogy botany zoology or economics and by shewing the benefit that must accrue to themselves and their country as re∣wards to their diligence That animated spirit which runs through the whole of this composition renders it one of the most pleasing and instructive of all our author's productions That intimate knowledge which LINNAEUS himself had acquired of his own country by his repeated travels fraught as he was too with every requisite for making use∣ful observations enabled him to point out with the utmost precision the most proper objects of investigation in every part of nature and his love to his country gave a zeal to his wishes that shewed him on this occasion to great advan∣tage not to add the aid arising from that self∣congratulation which he must feel having just gained by his late appointment the summit of his wishes  The ITER OELANDICUM ET GOTLANDICUM in  o  pp were printed at  Stockholm  in in the  Swedish  language as was also the ITER SCANICUM in  o  pp We cannot help regretting that these  Itinera  have not made  their appearance in the  English  or some other language besides that of  Sweden  for though in a country cultivated like ours many hints perhaps might not be drawn from these volumes of real importance to agriculture  here  yet they are so replete with curious and philosophical observa∣tions that they could not fail to be an acceptable present to the public as the general scope of these volumes is to adapt natural history to eco∣nomical purposes In the  Iter Gothlandicum et Oelandicum  LINNAEUS'S instructions were di∣rected principally to these particularsHe was to endeavour to find some kind of earth proper for making potteryware in imitation of the porcelaine of  China  he was to notice every production of nature that might supersede the necessity of the importation of any article used either in physic or manufactures and in fine he was to have a regard to every part of natural history In the execution of his plan however he went much farther than his commis∣sion extended having interspersed a number of observations relating to the antiquities of these islands the mechanic arts to the manners of the people their fishery and various other articles He was as might reasonably be expected un∣successful in the first part of his commission since the two islands are almost entirely com∣posed of limestone or coral rocks which abound in a remarkable degree in the  Baltic  As a proof of the little attention that had been paid to natural history in  Sweden  we may observe  that our author in this journey discovered above an hundred plants which before were not known to be indigenous many of which were such as are used in physic and in dyeing He pointed out to the natives several plants of great use in rustic economy and shewed them the advantage of planting the Seareed grass  Arundo arenaria  to arrest the sand and form soil on the shores to which it is extremely well adapted by the length of the roots In the ITER OELANDICUM there occurs a curious remark in vegetation confirming the annual increase of the wood in an oaktree in which was perfectly distinguished the hard winters of and by the narrow∣ness of the circles in those years He describes the process for making tar as practised by these islanders and further intersperses many observa∣tions relating to mineralogy in general to iron in particular with which  Sweden  abounds de∣scribes the iron mountain  Taberg  See  Phil Transact  vol xlix p the alum mines of  Mockleby  the  Poma chrystallina  or  aëtites marmo∣reus  which illustrates the formation of chrys∣tals c  In the ITER SCANICUM performed in our author treats largely on the culture of marshy grounds on the useful and noxious herbs for instance the  Stakan  supposed to be the  Phellan∣drium aquaticum  or  Water Hemlock  which it is believed renders horses that eat it paralytic on the  Gramen Mannae  or  Festuca fluitans  the seeds of which are so particularly useful in fattening geese on the  Agaricus muscarius  c  In on occasion of conferring a degree on Dr  J Westman  the professor delivered his third ORATION  de Telluris habitabilis incremento  an elaborate and ingenious defence of that hypo∣thesis which Sir  Isaac Newton  and several other philosophers have inclined to  That the pro∣portion of water on the globe of this earth is constantly decreasing  This leads the pro∣fessor also to discuss the d section of the  PhilosophiaInitio rerum ex omni specie viventium unicum sexus par creatum fuisse suadet ratio  The visible recession of the waters of the sea in divers parts of the earth particularly apparent in the  Baltic  had inclined the  Swedish  philosophers to this opinion of Sir  Isaac Newton  's The position of the  Philosophia  he thinks naturally deducible from the foregoing hypothesis and necessarily so from the  Mosaic  history In solving the difficul∣ties attending the latter part of the hypothesis he is led by his subject to enter largely into a part of the economy of nature which renders his dis∣course highly interesting independently of ali con∣jectures relating to the main argument this re∣lates to the various ways in which vegetables are disseminated and by which they find their way to every part of the globe To this effect winds rain rivers the sea animals c are all subser∣vient as well as the various structure and pro∣perties of the seeds themselves in illustrating which last affair the professor has taken great pains and constructed tables of the genera founded on these different properties of the seeds In the introduction to this oration our author turns the  attention of his readers to some of the more re∣markable discoveries that had lately been made in natural history and philosophy such were those relating to the  Polype Rattlesnake  and the  Senega  c among others also he mentions a remarkable fact that had been communicated by  Sauvages  of  Montpelier  respecting the effect of the berries of the  Coriaria myrtifolia  Spec pl Myrtleleaved Sumach in occasioning instant epilepsy  The three orations of LINNAEUS are subjoined to the second volume of the  Amoenitates Academicae  printed in  In the professor published his FLORA SUECICA  exhibens Plantas per Regnum Sueciae cres∣centes systematice cum differentiis specierum synonymis autorum nominibus incolarum solo locorum usu Pharmacopoeorum    o  Holm pp and again with many additions in pp The first edition contains plants In the second they are increased by his own and the discoveries of his pupils to No generical characters are introduced into this work but re∣ferences made to them as they stand in the  Genera Plantarum  before spoken of A number of select  synonyma  is added to his own specific name under each plant and not only the  Swedish  names in general but the  provincial  ones highly worthy this of imitation in works of this kind and quite ne∣cessary in so extensive a kingdom Many of the rare plants are described at large and botanical criticisms added to many others In the last edi∣tion the author has interspersed a great number  of curious observations relating to the economical and medical uses of the plants and has particu∣larly noted those that are capable of being ap∣plied to the purposes of dyeing The author moreover never fails to mention  euporistic  medi∣cines which he seems to think perhaps very justly have not been attended to by physicians as they deserve The plan of this work has been a pattern for all succeeding writers of  local  cata∣logues more especially those who have followed the  Linnaean  system and has been very little im∣proved by any perhaps excelled by none The plants of  Lapland  are all included in this work and the preface besides the account of  Swedish  authors on botany contains a curious division of the several provinces of the kingdom in respect to their different soils and situation as adapted to particular plants specifying under each pro∣vince the plants found therein  In appeared the FAUNA SUECICA  sistens Animalia Sueciae Regni Mammalia

not less than Neither in this work are any  classical ordinal  or  generical  notes given at large The world had never seen so compendious and it may be truly said at the same time so complete a  zoology  before Here as in plants the author has given to each animal a new specific name expressive as far as possible of its essential character The  synonyms  are added  or referred to from almost every author on the subject and almost every animal is moreover com∣pendiously described  Insects  make a very consi∣derable part of this catalogue near species all found in that kingdom are enumerated distin∣guished and methodized in a manner entirely new and which has been adopted by nearly every writer on the subject since We shall speak more fully of the classification in the abstract intended to be given of the  Systema Naturae  A compendious manual of  English Zoology  on this plan is a work much wanted though we think it could not fail to enhance its value if the tables of the genera were prefixed to each class and the characters to each genus as in the  System  of our author Two plates of some of the rarer birds chiefly accom∣pany this volume on which are explained the technical terms used in  ornithology  The number of each class of animals stands thus  Mammalia    Aves    Amphibia    Pisces    Insecta    Vermes    An accident having thrown into the hands of the professor an  Herbarium  consisting of five large volumes of plants he discovered that it was the collection of the famous Dr  Paul Herman  which had been made in the island of  Zeylon  by that gentleman at the expence of the  Dutch  East India Company This  Herbarium  had been lost for up∣wards of half a century until chance threw it into the hands of M  Gunther  apothecary to the king of  Denmark  who sent it to LINNAEUS re∣questing  the professor to examine it and affix the names to the plants of this superb collection Its great value as being collected by so eminent a man induced our author to examine the whole with great attention and he was thereby enabled to form many new  genera  and settle many doubt∣ful species He published the result of his la∣bour under the title of FLORA ZEYLANICA  sistens Plantas indicas Zeylonae Insulae quae olim    lectae fuere à Paulo Hermanno Professore Botan Ley∣densi demum post    annos ab A Gunthero orbi redditae  Holm  o  pp tab  This work is yet of use as a  pinax  of these plants and as a  Linnaean  catalogue of  Burman  's  Thesaurus Zeylanicus  published in and illus∣trated with the figures of upwards of of these plants Many of the rare species are described and a very copious number of synonyms added to several of the  East Indian  plants The  Her∣barium  consisted of about plants of which the true places in the system are assigned to up∣wards of and the remainder were too im∣perfect to admit of distinction This volume is rendered valuable by a concise history of the pro∣gress of botany from the restoration of learning in the th century a natural history of the island and its general produce the life of Dr  Herman  a short account of  J Hartog  who was sent by Dr  Sherard  to make collections in this island and of  Burman  's  Thesaurus Zeylanicus  LINNAEUS authenticates this  Herbarium  to have been  Herman  's by shewing that the numbers and  the plants answer to his  Museum Zeylanicum  pub∣lished in  We now see LINNAEUS fixed in the situation that was so well adapted to his character his taste and abilities and which seems to have been the object of his ambition and center of his hopes Soon after his establishment he laboured to get the Academical Garden which had been founded in put on a better footing and very soon effected it procuring also a house to be built for the residence of the professor The whole had been in ruin ever since the fire in and at the time  Linnaeus  was appointed professor of botany the garden did not contain above plants that were exotic His correspondence with the first botanists in  Europe  soon supplied him with great variety He received  Indian  plants from  Jussieu  of  Paris  and from  Van Royen  of  Leyden European  plants from  Haller  and  Ludwig American  plants from the late Mr  Collinson  Mr  Catesby  and others and variety of annuals from  Dillenius  in short how much the garden owed to his diligence and care in a few years may be seen by the catalogue published under the title of HORTUS UPSALIENSIS  exhibens Plantas exoticas horto Upsaliensis Academiae a sese  Linnaeo  illatas ab anno    in annum    additis differentiis synonymis habitationibus hospitiis rariorumque descriptionibus in gratiam studiosae ju∣ventutis  Holm  o  pp tab By this catalogue it appears that the professor had introduced species exclusive of all the  Swedish  plants and of varieties which latter in ordinary gardens amount not unfrequently  to one third of the whole number The preface contains a curious history of the cli∣mate at  Upsal  and the progress of the seasons through the whole year From these observa∣tions we learn that the greatest degree of heat in the summer of at  Upsal  was on the second day of  July  when  Celsius  's thermometer stood at degrees above that the greatest degree of cold on the th of  January  was de∣grees below In this thermometer the freezing point is and boiling water From seven years observations on the  leafing  of the oak it was found never to push before the th of  May  or to be retarded beyond the d  About this period it was that LINNAEUS made a remarkable discovery relating to the generation of pearls in the  river PearlMuscle  Mya Margaritifera Syst This shellfish must not be confounded with what is called the  Mother of Pearl Shell  as that belongs to another genus is a seashell and an inhabitant of the warmer countries only The shellfish in question is found in  rivers  in all the northern parts of the world in  Norway  and  Sweden  it abounds it is found in the rivers of the county of  Tyrone  in  Ireland  and in those of  Done∣gall  in  Scotland  the  Don  is said to abound with it and it is not unfrequent in the rivers of  Eng∣land  This fish will bear removal remarkably well and it is said that in some places they form reservoirs for the purpose of keeping it and taking out the pearl which in a certain period of time will be again renewed From observa∣tions on the growth of these shells and the num∣ber  of their annular  laminae  or scales it is sup∣posed the fish will attain a very great age or years are imagined to be a moderate computation The discovery turned on a method which LIN∣NAEUS found of putting these muscles into a state of producing pearls at his pleasure though the final effect did not take place for several years he says that in or years after the operation the pearl would have acquired the size of a  Vetch  We are unacquainted with the means by which he accomplished this extraordinary ope∣ration but it was probably published at the time and considered as important since it is cer∣tain that the author was rewarded with a munifi∣cent  praemium  from the States of the kingdom on this account We regret that we cannot speak more fully on this head but may ob∣serve that it is probable from a paper published many years afterwards in the  Berlin  Acts that the method consisted in injuring the shell externally perhaps by a perforation as it has been observed that these concretions in shellfish are found on the inside exactly opposite to perforations and injuries made from without by  serpulae  and other animals  From the time that LINNAEUS and  Rosen  were appointed professors at  Upsal  it should seem that the credit of that university as a school of physic had been increasing and the fact in∣deed is certain that numbers of students re∣sorted thither from  Germany  attracted by the character of these two able men and certainly in  Sweden  itself many young men were invited to  the study of physic by the excellent manner in which it was taught who otherwise would have engaged in different pursuits We must not deviate into the line of  Rosen  's department suf∣fice it to say that these two eminent men by their united zeal and abilities failed not to exalt together with their own fame that of their uni∣versity LINNAEUS in teaching the  diagnosis mor∣borum  had adopted the plan with some alteration of M  Sauvages  's Nosology of which we shall be led to give some account hereafter In the year he published for the use of his students MATERIA MEDICA  Liber I de Plantis digestus secundum genera loca nomina qualitates vires dif∣ferentias durationes simplicia modos usus synony∣ma culturas praeparata potentias composita  Holm  o  pp The compendious method in which this work is executed and the several useful preliminary papers annexed render it a very useful and instructive manual to students in medicine A  materia medica  of the vegetable king∣dom in which every simple was ascertained by so able a botanist as LINNAEUS was a very con∣siderable acquisition to science In this volume are arranged subjects and several are for the first time reduced to their proper  genera  such are the  Ipecacuanha Pareira brava Coculi Indici  and others The method pursued in this volume is as follows The author gives  His own specific character of the plant    C Bauhine  's synonym or if the plant was unknown to him that of the first discoverer  The country where it is produced In  the same line is expressed by a single epithet whether it be an  herb shrub  or  tree  whether it be

title of  Amoenitates Academicae seu Dissertationes variae phy∣sicae medicae et botanicae  This publication has  been continued from time to time to the com∣pletion of the seventh volume in the year  Holm  These volumes as soon as published were constantly reprinted in  Germany  and  Hol∣land  As these academical dissertations were sustained under LINNAEUS in his professorial character and were selected by himself they have been regarded as of equal authority nearly with his own writings and many of them do in a particular manner extend and exemplify divers parts of his works the subjects having been pointed out by himself in many instances for that purpose For these reasons we shall in the course of this volume give a very brief ac∣count of the purport of each dissertation since they contain a great variety of curious intelligence on the subjects of physic and natural history every where digested in the most scientific taste  Whilst LINNAEUS was meditating one of his capital performances which had long been ex∣pected and greatly wished for he was interrupted by a very long and painful fit of the gout which left him in a very weak and dispirited state and according to the intelligence that his friends gave of him nothing was thought to have contributed more to the restoration of his spirits than the seasonable acquisition at this juncture of a col∣lection of rare and undescribed plants  Upon the recovery of his health he published his book PHILOSOPHIA BOTANICA  in qua expli∣cantur fundamenta botanica cum definitionibus partium exemplis terminorum observationibus rariorum ad∣jectis  figuris aeneis  Stockh et Amst  o  pp  tab  This must be considered as the in∣stitutions of the  Linnaean  system of botany and is a work which none who wish to be acquainted with the sexual system can be without as it is the author's own comment on his  Fundamenta  first published in and which are comprized in aphorisms divided into chapters The author's original intention was to have explained all these aphorisms at large in the manner that had been done in the  Bibliotheca Botanica Classes Plantarum Sponsalia Plantarum Critica Botanica  and  Vires Plantarum  but he says his numerous avocations did not allow him requisite time  Ch Exhibits a systematical distribution of the principal botanical writers and is that part which is treated of at large in the  Bibliotheca  Ch  Systemata  A view of all the botanical systems being a compend of the  Classes Plantarum  but here brought down somewhat later so as to comprehend the general view of  Van Royen  's  Haller  's and  Wachendorf  's  Ch  Plantae  Explains the terms used in de∣scribing the different kinds of roots stalks and leaves of plants  Ch  Fructificatio  Describes the parts of fructification and defines all the terms used re∣specting their  number figure proportion situation  and  uses  Ch Relates to the sexes of plants a subject which is more copiously treated in a paper called  Sponsalia Plantarum  printed in the first volume of the  Amoenitates Academicae  Ch  Characteres  Rules and definitions for establishing the characters of  classes orders  and  genera  Ch  Nomina  Rules for rightly forming  ge∣nerical  names and those of  orders  and  classes  Ch  Differentiae  Rules for establishing the  specific  characters of plants  Ch  Varietates  Rules for distinguishing va∣rieties among plants  Ch  Synonyma  Rules relating to the right disposition of  synonymical names  in botanic writ∣ings  The four chapters last mentioned make the sub∣ject of the CRITICA BOTANICA in which work every aphorism is much more largely explained than in the present  Ch  Adumbrationes  Rules for properly de∣scribing and naming the  species  and for giving their complete history in a scientific manner  Ch  Vires  Relates to the virtues of plants as deducible from their agreement in their charac∣ters as of the same  genus  the same  natural order  or  class  The subject of this chapter is treated in a more comprehensive manner in the  Vires Plantarum  printed in the first volume of  Amoeni∣tates Academicae  To give a few instances how∣ever as illustrationsThe Scammony Me∣choacan Turbith and Sea Bindweed are all  species  of the genus  Convolvulus  and all agree in possessing a purgative quality The Mallow Marshmallow and Cottonbush are so many distinct  genera  under a natural order called  columniferous  and agree in being all mucilaginous  Of the  umbelliferous  plants such as grow in  dry  places are aromatic and considered as sudorifics and carminatives those growing in  watery  places on the contrary are mostly of a quality to be justly suspected and not a few of them quite  noxious  Plants of the  papilionaceous  class are all excellent food for cattle The  syngenesious  com∣monly  bitters  The  coniferous  class all evergreens and  resinous  are considered as diuretics  Ten explanatory plates are added to this vo∣lume on which are described the different leaves and their situations on the stalk c different stalks roots flowers c The first part of these plates relating to the leaves had been given in∣troductory to the  Hortus Cliffortianus  Some new terms in botany▪ which have been invented since the publication of the  Philosophia  may be found in a paper under the title of  Termini Botanici  in the th volume of the  Amoenitates  In this work of LINNAEUS it is difficult to de∣termine whether we ought most to admire the ge∣nius of its author in his inventive power or that exquisite scientific arrangement which he has given to the whole and which both together constitute this a most excellent performance  At the end of the volume we meet with several curious fragments such are  Directions to botanic pupils  The method of constructing an  herbarium  Method of conducting botanical excursions  Method of laying out a botanic garden  Plan for naturalists in travelling and con∣structing  their journal with an enumeration of all those subjects that demand their attention  Idea of a compleat botanist Some of the principal botanists are here enumerated  A compend of the philosophy of vege∣tation  In appeared the Professor's  Opus maximum et aeternum  the SPECIES PLANTARUM  exhibentes Plantas rite cognitas ad genera relatas cum differentiis specificis nominibus trivialibus synonymis selectis locis natalibus secundum systema sexuale di∣gestas  Tom II  Holm    o  pp and a second time in pp To give this work its utmost perfection had been the author's object for many years and to this all his other bota∣nic productions are in some measure only prepara∣tory especially the  local  catalogues as the rightly ascertaining the  species  is the great object of all me∣thod In this work  Linnaeus  takes in every plant that had come sufficiently under his  own  inspec∣tion seldom admitting any on the authority of others and wheresoever he has done it the plant is distinguished by a proper mark The plan of this work is in general agreeable to that of all his other local catalogues no other part of the system being exemplified except the  species  and as it is entirely botanical none of the uses of the plants are here introduced Every plant has its  specific  name constructed according to the rules established in the eighth part of the  Philo∣sophia Botanica  with a reference to all or any of his own works in which it has been mentioned be∣fore  and the synonym is given if it be different from the present Then follow the synonyms of the best authors and constantly where the plant is at all rare or newlydiscovered there is a reference to the best figures The country in which the plant grows is then added and frequently a sym∣bol expressive of its duration whether annual biennial or perennial  In this work for the first time the professor has given to each plant what he calls a  trivial  name that is a single epithet which may be ex∣pressive as far as possible of the  essential specific  difference among the species of the genus this however can take place but rarely in other in∣stances it is expressive of some the most striking and obvious difference and not seldom it is a lo∣cal term or the name of the first discoverer The latter method could it have taken place would have had the advantage of conveying somewhat like a chronological history of each plant and at the same time perpetuating due credit to the dis∣coverer These  trivial  names are printed in the margin to catch the eye instantly which is a great advantage The invention of trivial names the hint of which was probably borrowed from  Rivini  by assisting the memory has much promoted the knowledge of plants and must be considered as a capital improvement Their use in speaking of plants and forming compendious catalogues has been acknowledged by every botanist since the introduction of them  In the preface the author gives an ample ac∣count of the assistances he received and of the  pains he had taken to bring this work to its pre∣sent state To this end he specifies the coun∣tries he had travelled over the many botanic gardens he had visited the various excellent  her∣baria  that he had examined in  Sweden Holland England  and  France  the names of his pupils educated under him and their various peregrina∣tions from all which he reaped great advantages as from these he received various new plants and finally he acknowledges the many liberal communications of seeds and specimens sent to him from all parts of the world by the first bota∣nists of the time  As this work contains all the plants of the known world which had come to  Linnaeus  's knowledge or rather inspection which at the publication of these volumes appear to have amounted to about species all varieties excluded the professed botanist has only to regret that it could not have been extended by the author himself to a com∣pleat  pinax  and  history  of every plant therein de∣scribed  In this year also LINNAEUS published MUSEUM TESSINIANUM  opera Ill Comitis C G  TESSIN  Regis Regnique Senatoris c c collectum  Holm fol pp tab This is a description of the cabinet of LINNAEUS'S first patron and great friend  Count Tessin  at that time preceptor to the Prince Royal now King of  Sweden  who had spared no expence in collecting a rich museum principally consisting of subjects in mineralogy and particu∣cularly abounding in fossils of the figured or ex∣traneous kind The work is in  Swedish  and  Latin  and the tables represent several scarce and very valuable  figured fossils  not to be seen elsewhere  The petrifactions or figured fossils in this work are arranged in four orders founded on the dif∣ferent modes of the formation of them    Fossilia  commonly so called shells corals animal

mould thus retaining the cast without the external coat    Impressa  Impressions only as of fishes and capillary plants or ferns c    Transubstantiata  Perfect petrifactions in which the original

Animalia rariora imprimis et exotica Quadrupedia Aves Amphibia Pisces In∣secta Vermes describuntur et determinantur Latine et Suetice  Fol pp tab This splen∣did volume is frequently referred to by our author in his  Systema  on account of the figures of so many of the rarer serpents and fishes here engraven Of the former there are species and of the lat∣ter specimens of which are all preserved in spirits in the royal museum in the palace of  Ulricksdahl  The fame which our author had now acquired  by his  Systema Naturae  of which a sixth edition much enlarged had been published at  Stockholm  in in  o  pp with eight tables expla∣natory of the classes and orders and which was also republished by  Gronovius  at  Leyden  had brought as it were a conflux of every thing rare and valuable in every branch of nature from all parts of the globe into  Sweden  The king and queen of  Sweden  had their separate collections of rarities the former at  Ulricksdahl  as hath just been mentioned the latter very rich in exotic insects and shells procured at a great expence at the palace of  Drottningholm  These our author was employed in arranging and describing Be∣sides these the  museum  of the royal academy of  Upsal  had been augmented by a considerable do∣nation from the king whilst hereditary prince in by another from Count  Gyllenborg  the year before by a third from  M Grill  an opulent citizen of  Stockholm  The contents of these three collections are given in the first volume of the  Amoenitates Academicae  We mention them here only to shew that LINNAEUS now began to enjoy ample resources in every branch of natural history at home besides that many ingenious men who had been educated under him were now dispersed into various quarters of the globe and that from their letters he received great intelligence and satisfaction Seeds and specimens of plants were sent him from  Siberia  by  Gmelin  from  America  by Dr  Mitchel  and Governor  Coldingham  from  England  by Mr COLLINSON Mr  Ellis  as also from his friends in  Holland  and various other parts  of  Europe  And thus it will be seen that he be∣gan scarcely to feel the disadvantages of his northern situation  We shall now also begin to see the professor in a more elevated rank and situation in life His reputation had already procured him ho∣nours from almost all the Royal Societies in  Eu∣rope  Into the  Imperial Academy  he had been very early received and distinguished according to the custom of that institution with a classic name having most aptly been called DIOSCORIDES  secun∣dus  and in the year he received this honour from the Royal Society of  London  and his own sovereign truly sensible of his merit and greatly esteeming his character and abilities favoured him with a mark of his distinction and regard by creating him a KNIGHT of the POLAR STAR It was now no longer  Laudatur et alget  His emo∣luments kept pace with his fame and honours his practice in his profession became lucrative and we find him soon after possessed of his country house and gardens at  Hammarby  about five miles from  Upsal  He had moreover received one of the most flattering testimonies of the extent and magnitude of his fame that perhaps was ever shewn to any literary character the state of the nation which conferred it with all its circumstances duly considered This was an invitation to  Ma∣drid  from the king of  Spain  there to preside as a naturalist with the offer of an annual pension for life of pistoles letters of nobility and the perfect free exercise of his own religion An offer not readily parallelled in the history of modern  times That he did not accept of it is cer∣tain having after the most perfect acknowledg∣ments of the singular honour done him returned for answer  that if he had any merits they were due to his own country  In the year the Royal Academy of Sciences at  Stockholm  honoured our professor with one of the first premiums agreeably to the will of Count  Sparre  who had decreed two gold medals of ten ducats value each to be annually given by the academy to the authors of such papers in the preceding year's  Stockholm  Acts as should be ad∣judged most useful in promoting agriculture par∣ticularly and all branches of rural oeconomy This medal bore on one side the arms of the Count with this motto  Superstes in Scientiis amor  FREDE∣RICI SPARRELINNAEUS obtained it in consequence of a paper  de Plantis quae Alpium Suecicarum in∣digenae magno rei oeconomicae et medicae emolumento fieri possint  and the ultimate intention was to re∣commend these plants as adapted to culture in  Lapland  This paper was inserted in the  Stockholm  Acts for Vol XV  LINNAEUS also obtained the  praemium centum au∣reorum  proposed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at  Petersburgh  for the best paper written to  establish  or  disprove  by  new  arguments the doc∣trine of the sexes of plants On this occasion the professor wrote his DISQUISITIO  de quaestione ab Acad Imper Scient Petrop in annum    pro praemio proposita  SEXUM PLANTARUM  argumentis et experi∣mentis novis praeter adhuc jam cognita vel corroborare vel impugnare praemissa expositione historica et physica  omnium Plantae partium quae aliquid ad faecundationem et perfectionem seminis et fructus conferre credun∣tur ab eadem Academia die    Sept    in con∣ventu publico praemio ornata Petrop    o  pp  Apart from all foregoing arguments facts and experiments brought in support of this question the professor has in this little tract sufficiently proved by a series of  new  facts that the dust of the  Antherae  analogically called the male parts is absolutely necessary to be shed on the  stigma  or female part in order to render the seed fertile His theory of vegetation prefixed to this paper is explained more at large in the  Prolepsis Planta∣rum  printed in the th volume of the  Amoenitates  It was if possible an additional glory to LIN∣NAEUS to have merited this premium from the  Peters∣burgh  academy inasmuch as a professor of that society a few years before had with more than common zeal although with a futility like that of the other antagonists of our author endeavoured to overturn the whole  Linnaean  system of botany by attempting to shew that the doctrine of the sexes of plants had no foundation in nature and was unsupported by facts and experiments  The great character of LINNAEUS and that of his colleagues particularly of  Rosen  in the medical departments and their united endea∣vours had very considerably raised the credit of the university of  Upsal  as we have before ob∣served It is certain that the number of stu∣dents are at this time nearly double what they are said to have been in accounts written and  years ago The emulation excited among the students amply rewarded those gentlemen for their pains by the vast harvest of useful information flowing in particularly on the subjects of natural history from their pupils now dispersed in every part of the world Many of these young men after being properly grounded in the principles of physic had with an ardour which nothing but the strongest love of science could inspire volun∣tarily undertaken the most distant and perilous voyages supported by the munificence of parti∣cular patrons or societies to gratify their taste in the pursuits of natural history and other useful knowledge Several of these young men perish∣ed from change of climate or various other causes and much of the fruit of their labour was lost with them Such was the fate of  Ternströem  at  Pulicandor  in of  Hasselquist  who went into  Aegypt  and  Palestine  and died at  Smyrna  in of  Loefling  who died in  Cumana  in Of the first of these we have no remains The papers of  Hasselquist  were redeemed by the queen of  Sweden  and published by LINNAEUS under the title of ITER PALAESTINUM in in  o  and those of  Loefling  under the title of ITER HISPANICUM in to each of which is pre∣fixed a short account of the author We have also the fruit of  Kalm  's journey in  N America  and of the voyage of  Osbeck  and  Toren  who both went chap∣lains to  Swedish East India  ships These are here mentioned particularly as they are all translated and published since in the  English  language We yet deplore the more recent fate of  Forskal  and his  unfortunate associates in  Arabia  and the more so since his posthumous pieces published at  Copen∣hagen  in are sufficient to convince us that the fruit of that expedition would have been rich and large had it not been so unfortunately blasted  There were also several others who made less remote journies for the same purpose such were  L Montin  who visited  LulaLapmark  in  M Koehler  who travelled into the southern part of  Italy  in Dr SOLANDER who visited  PithoLapmark  and  TornoLapmark  in where he made several discoveries and brought back divers rare plants and other subjects in natural history which had escaped the diligence of his great master  D Rolander  who visited  Surinam  and  St Eustatia  in  A R Martin  who searched  Greenland  in as  C Alstroëmer  did the southern parts of  Europe  in We do not mention others who revisited the isle of  Gothland  in and after  Linnaeus  's own tour into that place  The travels of these gentlemen afforded great sources of information and furnished ma∣terials for our author that proved very favour∣able to the last editions of his  Systema Naturae  and  Species Plantarum  insomuch that we shall see him exemplifying in a much more perfect and de∣tailed manner his  System of Nature  This work as far as respected the  vegetable  kingdom had been separately and largely exhi∣bited as before mentioned in the  Genera Plan∣tarum  and the  species  given in the several  Florae  of  our author and finally in the  Species Plantarum  As yet however although it had passed through nine editions little more had appeared in the  ani∣mal  kingdom than the generical characters with a single specific name insomuch that the ninth edition at  Leyden  in was contained in a small octavo of pages This it must be ob∣served notwithstanding was only a republication of the author's sixth edition in The scheme therefore cannot be considered as perfected by the author until the publication of the th edition in the first part of which relating to the animal kingdom makes a volume of pages and the same part in the th and last edition is augmented by the addition of new subjects to pages This work therefore published in two volumes at  Stockholm  in and is to be considered as having received the author's finishing hand as far as possible since he pro∣fesses to describe only such  animals  as had fallen under his own inspection except in some instances where his dependence upon other authority ren∣dered it justifiable The title of this enlarged edition runs thus  SYSTEMA NATURAE  per regna tria Naturae secun∣dum classes ordines genera et species cum charac∣teribus differentiis synonymis locis  Holm I II III  TOM I  The  ANIMAL KINGDOM  In this volume after a philosophical history of the animal kingdom in general our author pro∣ceeds to the establishment of the classical cha∣racters  previous to which he presents us with the  natural  division of animals arising from their different  internal structure  an arrangement partly established by  Aristotle  and of which our own great naturalist Mr RAY has made considerable use in the introductory part of his  Synopsis Ani∣malium  By this division all the animal kingdom naturally falls into six classes as follow animals having the  HEART furnished with  Two ventricles and auricles  Blood  warm and red  Viviparous  MAMMALIA  Oviparous  BIRDS  One ventricle and auricle  Blood  cold and red  Respiration voluntary  AMPHIBIA  Breathing by Gills  FISHES  One ventricle with∣out auricle  Sanies  cold and co∣lourless  Antennated  INSECTS  Tentaculated  VERMES  He then gives the  natural  characters at large of each class taking in with the foregoing internal structure all the differences arising from the  lungs  or other organs of respiration as  gills  from the  maxillae  jaws or mandibles the organs of  genera∣tion  those of  sensation  the  teguments  or outward covering and the  fulcra  or legs wings c Our plan does not admit of introducing these at large  At the head of each class is given a concise and most instructive  description  of the  classical  cha∣racter so methodically constructed as to include at the same time an explanation of all the  terms  appertaining to that class concluding with a ge∣neral mention of the best authors thereon  After this our author proceeds to the establishment of the  natural  characters of each  order  of the class respectively These also we must omit as incon∣sistent with our compendious view of the system and more especially the latter classes of this king∣dom where the subjects are so numerous but in the four first classes we propose to give the  artificial  generical characters as they stand at the head of each order  Class I MAMMALIA  This class comprehends not only all the animals which we call  Quadrupeds  the  Lizard  genus or rather the  reptiles Pedati  excepted but also the  cetaceous  order or Whales Cachalots and Porpesses This arrangement of Whales with Quadrupeds which did not take place in the first editions of this work has not been relished by some very respectable Zoologists who wrote be∣fore LINNAEUS but our author thinks himself fully justified on account of the agreement of these animals in the  structure of the heart  in the respiration by means of  lungs  in their hav∣ing  moveable eyelids ears  in being  viviparous  in being furnished with  teats  and in other parti∣culars by which they differ so materially from  fishes  as to more than balance that single agree∣ment in living in the same  element  The MAMMALIA are divided by our author into seven  orders  the distinctions of which are in this  artificial  arrangement principally established on  the difference in the  number  situation and form of the three kinds of teeth namely the  primores  or  incisores  called  foreteeth  or  cutting  teeth the  laniarii  or  canini  called dogteeth  canine  or lace∣rating teeth and the  molares  double teeth or  grinders  LINNAEUS notwithstanding does not entirely neglect the  feet  as will appear from his description of the  natural  characters of the  orders  as well as from the following  systematic  arrangement of this class    Digitated  Foreteeth

adding to the latter only the abbreviated characters  I PRIMATES Animals furnished with foreteeth or cutting teeth four above parallel Two pectoral teats  II BRUTA No foreteeth  III FERAE Six sharp foreteeth in the up∣per jaw One canine tooth on each side  There are exceptions in this order The  Di∣delphis  hath The  Sorex  hath And the  Erinaceus    IV GLIRES Two foreteeth in each jaw close together but remote from the grinders No canine teeth  V PECORA No foreteeth in the upper jaw six or eight in the lower jaw very remote from the grinders Hoofed feet inguinal teats  VI BELLUA Foreteeth truncated Hoofed feet  VII CETE Breathing apertures on the head Pectoral fins Tail placed horizontally No claws  Abbreviated  generic  characters  I PRIMATES  Howsoever the pride of man may be offended at the idea of being ranked with the beasts that perish he nevertheless stands as  an animal  in the system of nature at the head of this  order  and as such is here described with his several varieties observable in the different quarters of the globe in a manner and with an accuracy peculiar to our author and which we may venture to say is no where else to be met with But man is not left by LINNAEUS to contemplate himself merely as such but he is led to the consideration of what he ought to be as an  intelligent and moral being  in a comment on the  Grecian  Sage's dictate KNOW THYSELF by the true application of which he cannot but be sufficiently elevated above every humiliating idea which can otherwise arise from such an association  SIMIA  Ape  Canine teeth separate

species Mr  Pennant  in his  Synopsis of Quadrupeds  and our learned friend  Professor  MARTIN in his  Elements of Natural History  by including some animals that were unknown to LINNAEUS and giving the rank of species to several that were considered by our author as varieties have extended the number of  Mammalia  to species  Class II AVES BIRDS  These are divided by LINNAEUS into six  orders  the distinctions of which are chiefly taken from the  beak  but in some genera it has been necessary to call in the  tongue nares  or  nostrils  and in some instances the  feet  and other parts We shall give the characters of the  orders  as they stand at the head of each and subjoin the  abbreviated generical  characters enumerating the number of species under each genus  I ACCIPITRES RAPACIOUS Birds having the upper mandible of the  beak  furnished on each side with an angular process  II PICAE PIES Birds having the  beak  some∣what compressed on the sides and convex on the upper

spe∣cies  COLUMBA  Pigeon  Beak rather arched or convex nostrils gib∣bose and half covered with a membrane  Wood Pigeon  and its descendant the Common  Ring Dove Tur∣tle Dove Migratory  c species  The  specific  characters in the class of  birds  are deduced from a great variety of particulars In several as in the  Falcon  genus the colour of the  cere  or naked tunic that surrounds the basis of the  beak  and the colour of the legs assist in distin∣guishing the species The  colour  of the bird in general is subject to great variation in different countries as well as in the same country at dif∣ferent  seasons in the year as is more particularly seen in the arctic regions not to mention that of the sexes in almost all kinds Our author therefore does not trust to this wherever a more permanent mark can be found It must however be con∣fessed that in too many instances it is necessary to trust entirely to this distinction howsoever un∣stable The form of the  tail  as it happens to be  even cuneated  or  forked  is an excellent and firm note in the  Parrot  genus its length as  shorter  or  longer  than the body is of great service In others the  colour  of the  beak  a  naked  or  crested head  con∣tribute to form the note of distinction And in fine nature has stamped upon others some pecu∣liarity which points them out immediately as the  receptacle  of the lower mandible in the  Pelican  two long  tailfeathers  in the  Tropicbird  the di∣rection of the mandibles in the  Crossbeak  c Among the common marks none more frequently occur than the differences of colour in the  quill∣feathers  and those of the  tail  This class compre∣hends upwards of subjects  Class III AMPHIBIA  This class is so called by LINNAEUS not because all the subjects of it are strictly speaking ca∣pable of living either in air or water but prin∣cipally from their power of suspending or per∣forming the function of respiration in a more ar∣bitrary manner than other animals This class is divided into four  orders  I REPTILES REPTILES Amphibious ani∣mals breathing through the mouth by means of  lungs only and furnished with four feet  II SERPENTES SERPENTS Amphibious animals

Flying Dragon  of  Amboina  c species  This part of the System contains upwards of subjects  In the REPTILES order the specific characters of the  Testudo  genus are deduced principally from the difference in the  shells  and the  feet  which in the  Turtles  are pinniform and in the  Tortoises  di∣gitated In the  Lacerta  genus from the  tail head toes  and various other parts and in the  Rana  from the diversity in the  make of the body  and number of the  claws  on the fore or hinder feet  In the SERPENTES order the specific distinctions have ever been matter of great difficulty with naturalists as they were commonly taken from the  colour  which is subject to an almost infinite variation Hence it has happened that  Seba  de∣pending on the  colours  alone hath in the opinion of our author figured the  Boa Constrictor  or Gi∣gantic Serpent ten times as so many distinct spe∣cies and the  Coluber Naga  or Hooded Viper fourteen LINNAEUS at length discovered a much  more certain and permanent note upon which his  specific  characters are solely founded it was first exemplified in the  Amphibia Gyllenborgiana  and he has since retained it in all his works sensible however that it is yet liable to failure this arises from the number of the small  shields  and  scales  or  rings  and  rugae  of the belly and tail and the pro∣portion those numbers bear to each other in the different species for example in our  Common Viper  the  shields  of the  belly  are usually about and the  scales  of the  tail  that is all below the anus about or the  shields  in our  Common Snake  about and the  scales  about  In the NANTES the specific characters are short but very various in the different  genera  as to the parts of the animal from which they are deduced in the  Petromyzon  and  Raia  from the  mouth fins teeth  c in the latter very much from the  body  itself in the  Squalus  from a variety of parti∣culars in the  Acipenser  from the  cirri  or beard and the  dorsal shields  or  squamae  in the  Balistes  from the fins and tail in the  Ostracion  from the different  angulated form  of the  body  in the  Tetrodon  from differences in the body chiefly and in the remaining  genera  from the form of the body and the differences in the fins  Class IV PISCES FISHES  In the earlier editions of the  Systema Naturae  our author in the distribution of FISHES had followed the method of his friend and fellow collegian  Artedi  whose  Icthyology  he had published  during his residence in  Holland  in This method which took in the CETACEOUS order now among the MAMMALIA and the NANTES now referred to the AMPHIBIA was established on the structure or rather  situation  of the  tails  in the  cetaceous  order and in others on the difference in the gills and the  rays  of the  fins  whether  car∣tilaginous  or  bony  In the two last editions ano∣ther disposition is attempted after having dis∣missed the  cetaceous  order to the MAMMALIA and the CHONDROPTERYGII or Cartilaginous Fishes and the  Branchiostegi  to the NANTES our author forms four  orders  of the  bony  fishes which respire by means of gills only from the  situation  of the  ventral  fins which he analogically considers as the  feet  of the animal according as they are placed either  before under  or  behind  the  pectoral  or gill fins or as in one order wanting the  ventral  fins  I APODES

later discoveries among which those made by Dr  Forskal  in  Arabia  are not the least as appears by his fragments lately published  Great pains were taken by  Artedi  and since by  Gronovius  and our author to distinguish the species by the  number  of the  rays  in the  fins  and although from repeated observations they are found to agree in many species very re∣markably yet in others they vary so much as not to establish a sufficient character At present in this system the specifical characters are taken from a great variety of particulars amongst which however the  number  of the  rays  in the  fins  is frequently the most distinctive and whe∣ther so or not it is subjoined to most species and usually as they have been observed by different authors The  form  of the  tail  the  cirri  or beard at the  mouth  the  length  of the  jaw  the  spots  and  lines  on the body c all conspire in their turn to the same end  Class V INSECTA INSECTS  No part of the system of nature has undergone a greater change than this class neither does our author stand more unrivalled than in the excel∣lent arrangement he has given to this branch of natural history which before his time was nearly without method It comprehends GENERA disposed into seven  orders  founded in most of them on the differences observable in the  number  and  texture  of the  wings  Our intended brevity will not permit a detail of the  genera  in the suc∣ceeding parts of the system we must therefore now that we are descended to the inferior parts of the animal kingdom only give the definitions of the several  orders  with a few observations The first order is called  I COLEOPTERA Insects having the wings co∣vered with two crustaceous cases divided by a longitudinal suture  This order is the most numerous it contains almost all those insects which go under the general name of  Beetles  and includes upwards of species ranked under genera Among these are the Chafers Stagbeetles Leathereaters Car∣rionbeetles Tortoisebeetles Ladyflies Honeybeetles Weevils Muskbeetles Glowworm Springbeetles Waterbeetles Blisterbeetle Rovebeetle Earwig and several other  genera  II HEMIPTERA Halfwinged insects having the shells or cases semicrustaceous not divided by  a straight suture but incumbent on each other in the margin The beak curved inwards  This order contains about species under  genera  among these are the Cockroach Camelcricket Locusts and Common Crickets Lan∣thornfly Flealocust Boatfly c Bug a nu∣merous genus Aphis or Currantlouse Cochi∣nealinsect and others  III LEPIDOPTERA Insects with four wings imbricated or cloathed with fine scales or feathers tongue spiral and coiled up body hairy  This order contains only three  genera  but the species are very numerous nearly The But∣terflies Hawkmoths and the Moths or  Phalenae  Of the latter LINNAEUS enumerates species This being the most beautiful tribe of insects has been much sought after and later entomologists have considerably increased this number  IV NEUROPTERA Insects with naked trans∣parent or reticulated wings tail in most kinds without a sting  Upwards of species in  genera  among these are the Dragonfly Mayfly Springfly Pearlfly Scorpionfly c  V HYMENOPTERA Insects with membra∣naceous wings excepting some few species which are destitute of wings females with the tail armed with a sting  This is a numerous order it contains in∣sects in  genera  among these are the Sawfly or  Tenthredo  Tailedwasp Ichneumonfly Ichneu∣monwasp Wasp Bee Ant and Golden Wallfly c  VI DIPTERA Insects with two wings fur∣nished also with a balance or club behind each wing  This order under  genera  contains near species among which are the Gadflies Gnats Common Fleshfly Waspfly Horsefly Beefly and others  VII APTERA Insects without wings in either sex  This order contains species under  genera  and falls easily into three divisions  With legs The Sugarmite Groundflea Deathwatch Louse Common Flea  With to legs The Tickspiders Scor∣pion Crab Kingcrab and Millepede  With numerous legs The Centipede and Gallyworm  In forming the  genera  under each of these or∣ders the  antennae  hold a principal rank and par∣ticularly in the COLEOPTERA but the author does not trust to them alone the  elytra  or out∣ward cases the head the  rostrum  or mouth the thorax and tail and indeed in almost every  genus  some or other of them are called in to assist in forming the character  In the HEMIPTERA the  rostrum  gives a note of primary use but here the  antennae wings  and  feet  come in also  In the LEPIDOPTERA the  antennae  and wings form the character  In the NEUROPTERA the mouth wings and tail  In the HYMENOPTERA the mouth the wings and the sting  In the DIPTERA the mouth or  proboscis  alone  In the APTERA the eyes the tail and the num∣ber of the feet c  Class VI VERMES  The sixth and last class contains the VERMES which are divided into five orders LINNAEUS very early adopted the new system of  Peysonnel Jussieu  and some others in introducing the corals and corallines into the animal kingdom under the names of LITHOPHYTA and ZOOPHYTA This system has had great light thrown upon it by the late excellent Mr ELLIS in his history of Coral∣lines and several papers printed in the Philosophi∣cal Transactions  As this is by far the most anomalous of all the classes the characters of the orders are very va∣rious  INTESTINA Animals simple naked desti∣tute of limbs  This order includes  genera  among which are the Guineaworm Ascarides Earthworm Gourd∣worm Leech c It contains but species  II MOLLUSCA Animals simple naked not in∣cluded in a shell but furnished with limbs  This order includes  genera  containing species Among these rank the common naked Snail Sea Hare of  Rondeletius Doris  Sea Mouse  Nereis Ascidia Actinia  or Sea Anemone  Tethys  Cuttlefish Sea Lungs or Blubbers Starfish and  Echinus  called Sea Hedgehog and others  III TESTACEA Animals generally of the foregoing order but included in a shell  This order takes in the whole tribe of shells consisting of upwards of species under  genera  and disposed in a method entirely new The three first  genera  are the  multivalves  the next fourteen  bivalves  and the remainder  univalves  IV LITHOPHYTA Composite animals affixed to and fabricating a fixed calcareous base called  Coral  This order contains species under four  gene∣ra  the  Tubipora  red tubular Coral  Madrepores  or Brain Stones  Millepores  and another called  Cel∣lepore  V ZOOPHYTA Animal composite resembling a flower and springing from a vegetating stem  This order contains genera of which nine are fixed and the other locomotive amongst the former rank the  Isis  or red Coral Sea Fan  Al∣cyonium  Sponge Corallines c among the latter the Polype Sea Pens  Taenia Furia  and lastly the assemblage of chaotic or microscopi∣cal  Animalcula  The species under this order are  The  generical  distinctions among the INTESTINA arise from the diversity of the body of the animal almost solely  In the MOLLUSCA from the body and feelers called  tentacula  and from other parts  In the TESTACEA the included animal the general differences between the shells themselves but principally the  cardo  or hinge in the bivalves  and the  aperture  in the univalves furnish the ge∣neric note  In the LITHOPHYTA the inhabitant animal and the form of the coral itself and in the ZOOPHYTA the animal and the very different forms of the fabrifications lay a foundation for the generic notes  After having thus exhibited a view of the  Classes  it remains that we give a general account of the method pursued in treating on each species To this end it must be observed that throughout the whole  system  the  classical  character that of the  order  and the  generical  note always make a part in the description of each  species  After these our author begins with his own  specific  name for the animal established upon the most essential difference observable between that and every other species of the  genus  and here it must be allowed that he has in general happily suc∣ceeded by giving in the space of two or three lines a distinction that more immediately points out the animal sought for than the long and la∣boured descriptions of many foregoing authors If the  specific  name is the same that is adopted in any of his former writings he refers to it He has however in many parts of this enlarged edition formed new names to animals noticed in the former edition and in the  Fauna Suecica  Where indeed the essential or specific distinction is the point in view this must frequently be the case so long as new species continue to come in for as the essential character of each  species  results  from the most careful comparison of the whole  genus  the introduction of a new one must in many instances so clash with the old as to re∣quire perhaps a total alteration in every  specific  name of the  genus  After his own specific name he gives the  synonyms  and page of the most reputed and au∣thentic writers in each class and particularly re∣fers to those who have best figured his subject then the  locus natalis  and in many instances more especially among the  Mammalia  and  Aves  a short but comprehensive history respecting the nature economy and uses of the animal To every animal the author has affixed his  trivial  name expressive most commonly of place where it is found of its colour form or some quality or attribute descriptive as far as may be of the ani∣mal or in a great variety of cases where the subject has been well known by a single term he retains that as his  trivial  name To instance in the Partridge and Quail which both belong to his  genus  established under the name  Tetrao  he therefore calls the former  Tetrao Perdix  and the latter  Tetrao Coturnix  It has been objected to LINNAEUS'S classification in various parts of his system that he has thrown together subjects too different in their general appearance and economy by keeping too closely to  one  character to instance particularly in the MAMMALIA by confining himself to the teeth To this it may be answered in general that if  only  quadrupeds were to be classed no system  needed to have bee built as their number is so small but when it is recollected that  all Nature  was under his eye and that therefore the subjects were almost infinite it became necessary to form the basis of every great division or class  as far as possible on one simple foundation  And perhaps it is the observance of this rule that has given LIN∣NAEUS'S system so greatly the advantage over all foregoing writers For as nature does not seem to have observed  any  system ours must be artificial and will ever have its anomalies As an artificial system therefore that must have the preference which will most readily lead to the subject under investigation in which case it is of small im∣portance where it is placed and how far removed from others with which it seems to bear a similar and general appearance  We shall close this brief view of the arrangement of animals by exhibiting the number of subjects enumerated all of which are synonymed by the author in the th edition of his  System  Mammalia    Insects    Birds    Vermes    Amphibia    Various from the Mantissae    Fishes    Total    With the first tome of the  Systema Naturae  is in∣timately connected a work of the professor's pub∣lished under the title of MUSEUM  Ludovicae Ulricae  REGINAE  in quo animalia rariora exotica imprimis  insecta et conchylia describuntur et determinantur pro∣dromi instar editum  Holm  o  pp This was drawn up and published by order of the queen of  Sweden  who had constructed a copious and rich cabinet of natural history at the palace of  Drottningholm  the subjects of which as hath been observed LINNAEUS had been appointed to arrange The great expence her majesty had be∣stowed in procuring particularly insects and fhells had given this collection an advantage that proved very favourable to our author by throwing in his way a multitude of fine and very expensive objects which otherwise probably he could have had no opportunity of describing and these were for∣tunately all collected before the publication of the enlarged editions of the  System  In this work the  exotic  insects and shells only are introduced of the former and of the latter with twentyfive of the  Mollusca  The in∣sects chiefly consist of the large and beautiful  Lepidoptera  and the shells abound with all their elegant varieties These are described at large with all that precision brevity and accurate ar∣rangement of the several parts which every where manifests itself so happily in our author's writings Both in  entomology  and  conchology  a new language is introduced and these descriptions may well stand as models for future writings  Annexed to this work is the second part or rather only the  prodromus  of the MUSEUM ADOLPHI  Frederici  REGIS  in quo animalia rariora imprimis et exotica aves amphibia pisces describuntur  pp  In this additional volume are described at large subjects of the animal kingdom all be∣longing to the first four classes and all acquired since the publication of the first part in Throughout the whole  System  LINNAEUS has referred to these books for descriptions at large to all the exotics and nothing could be more ac∣ceptable to the critical zoologist than to see the plan of this volume perfected through the whole history of animals  TOM II The VEGETABLE KINGDOM  The second part of the  Systema Naturae  relating to vegetables in all the editions prior to the tenth was very compendiously exhibited the au∣thor having after his  Clavis Classium  only given the names of the  genera  with their  essential  or ab∣breviated characters without touching at all on specific distinctions which were reserved for the present enlarged edition of the System and for the SPECIES PLANTARUM a work before spoken of This volume contains upwards of pages and in the twelfth edition of by the accession of new materials is enlarged to It contains in a most compendious manner a view of the whole vegetable kingdom as far as the subjects thereof had come under our author's own inspection dis∣posed according to that system of which LINNAEUS had been the inventor founded as to the classical part upon the  sexes  of plants a system now al∣most universally received It is in this branch  of the study of nature that this great naturalist has so distinguished himself From him  botany  boasts a new  aera  and HALLER one of the first writers of this age in the same line of science and who alone might dare to rival him has with a liberality of mind becoming a great man allowed this supe∣riority to LINNAEUS  Before we proceed to a particular account of this part of the system it may not be improper to premise some observations on  methods  of  botany  in general before our author wrote It is needless to urge the necessity of  method  in the study of na∣ture as it is the very soul of science and amidst such a multitude of objects which the vegetable kingdom affords all attempts towards the acqui∣sition of knowledge without it must end in un∣certainty and confusion We have sufficient proofs of this in the writers upon plants before the in∣vention of systems and see and deplore the want of them in the loss of many valuable articles not only in the  Materia Medica  but in the  Materia Pictoria  and  Tinctoria  of the antients Articles the virtues and properties of which appear to have been well ascertained are now lost to us for want of a more scientific arrangement of the subjects and accuracy in the descriptions of them  Botanic writers chose very different methods of arranging plants not only before but since the invention of systematic botany The  al∣phabetic  has been much followed especially in local catalogues Some have disposed the plants according to  the time of flowering  as  Pauli  in his  Quadripartitum Botanicum  published in  Bester  in the  Hortus Eystettensis  and  Dil∣lenius  in the  Catalogus Gissensis  Others have arranged them according to the  different places of their growth  as the authors of the  Historia Lugdu∣nensis  in and some according to their  virtues in medicine  Others again observing that numbers of vegetables agreed with each other in their general habit and appearance or had a certain harmony and proportion in the form and disposition of their roots leaves flowers or fruit in their particular mode of growing flowering or foliation saw that they naturally fell as it were into classes agree∣able to such distinctions Hence their division of trees into  pomiferae pruniferae bacciferae nuciferae glandiferae  c of herbs into  bulbosae siliquosae∣umbelliferae verticillatae papilionaceae  c These were so many  classes  or  orders  which nature had so characterized that they could not escape their notice and could all the subjects of the vegetable kingdom be  properly reduced  to such combinations and the whole chain  properly connected  we should then see what is meant by the NATURAL METHOD that  ultimum et desideratum  of botany of which our author says however  Nec sperare fas est quod nostra Aetas systema quoddam naturale videre queat et vix seri nepotes  Nevertheless the best writers of the last century such were  John  and  Caspar Bauhine  endeavoured to preserve the above∣mentioned arrangement although it was in a rude manner In this they were followed by our own countrymen  Gerard  and  Parkinson  but as  they established no precise definitions to their classes so in their subdivisions or chapters they paid little or no regard to the minuter parts of distinction taken from the fructification hence nothing like  generical notes  can be discovered in their methods so that the only resource in find∣ing many of their plants was to read over their long and tedious descriptions which after all were frequently insufficient to distinguish the plant sought for  That great naturalist  Conrade  GESNER who died in in his th year appears to have been the first who thought with any precision of a method of classing plants from the  flower  or  fruit  but he only slightly touches thereon in his epistles he lived not to bring any thing to perfection in this way It was reserved for  Caesalpinus  physician to Pope  Clement  VIII to be the first author who arranged plants in a true systematic manner in his  Libri de Plantis  published in in which he establishes the characters principally  from the fruit  It is wonderful that after his time though so many eminent botanists flourished among whom were the two  Bauhines  no one ever thought of pursu∣ing the plan he laid down until  Morison  and  Ray  who both published nearly together their separate systems founded also upon dis∣tinctions principally drawn from the fruit Since their time others have laboured to bring their systems to perfection as  Knaut  in  Germany Paul Herman  and  Boerhaave  in  Holland  and  Dillenius  late professor at  Oxford  had still far∣ther  perfected Mr  Ray  's method as is evident from the arrangement he has given to the  British  plants in the third edition of that author's  Synopsis  Several elegant systems have also been formed from the  flower  as the basis of the  classical  cha∣racter in considering which both the  regularity  and  irregularity  as well as the  number  of the  petals  have been made the principal distinction  Rivini  at  Leipsic  in was the first who took the flower as the foundation of his method as did  Ruppius  in But no one carried this me∣thod to such perfection as  Tournefort  in who forms his  classical  character from the  figure  of the  flower  and establishes his  orders  or subdivisions on the different  situation  of  the fruit  whether above or below the  empalement  or  receptacle  Besides these methods in which the authors have considered one part only either  flower  or  fruit  as the base of their systems several others have been constructed of late years in which ve∣getables have been arranged as far as possible according to what have been called the  natural classes  the foundations of which take in a nu∣merous set of characters arising from a combina∣tion and agreement in the  habit  of the plants as well as their  harmony  in the essential  parts of fructification  Among these that of  Van Royen  late professor at  Leyden  is among the most elegant at∣tempts towards this  ultimum  in botany This is exhibited in the  Prodromus Florae Leydensis  He is followed by  Gmelin  in the  Flora Sibirica  c These authors as also  L Gerard  in his  Flora Gallo▪provincialis  Paris preserve the  natural generical characters  of LINNAEUS almost entire through their systems and the latter writer has with some variations taken the  orders  of a  natural method  constructed by  B Jussieu  for his  classes  HALLER also planned and brought to great perfection a method of this kind as is exhibited in his  Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae  and in the  Hortus Gottingensis  which he has since still more elaborated in a work of infinite labour and merit the  Historia Stirpium Helvetiae  tom fol  LINNAEUS himself very early attempted a  na∣tural  method but it is evident he thought there were too many links wanting in the chain to ren∣der it the readiest guide to botanical science since he soon deserted it although he continued to improve it to the last however he only reduced the  genera  into  orders  but did not venture so far as to form the  classical  part of a system on that plan The present learned and indefatigable professor Dr HOPE at  Edinburgh  whose zeal and success in cultivating and diffusing the principles of the  Linnaean  system are well known has constructed perhaps the most elaborate attempt of this kind that the botanists have ever seen We join with many others in wishing that he may be enabled to give it all that perfection which may encourage him to present it to the public  Methods have also been formed from the dif∣ferent species and arrangement of the  calyx  or cup  of the flower in plants Professor  Magnol  of  Montpelier  published in on this plan and LINNAEUS himself in but he did not pursue it  Every method of arrangement hath its advan∣tage in some respect or other and it is surely rather to be regretted howsoever the  flower  may claim the preference that a method founded in the distinctions of the  fruit  should not also have as it were a secondary place in common use for as all artificial methods are only supposed to be so many  succedanea  to the  natural  one a due attention to each might tend to illustrate the natural classes to connect them and reduce the anomalies and so far pave the way to the accomplishment of that scheme which however will yet by many be considered as quite impracticable in botany  LINNAEUS was the first who constituted the  stamina  and  pistils  as the basis of an artificial me∣thod of arranging plants and he tells us in his CLASSES PLANTARUM he was led to this by considering the great importance of these parts in vegetation They alone are the essentials neces∣sary to fructification all other parts except the  anthera  and  stigma  being wanting in some flowers and the present philosophy of botany regards the former as the  male  and the latter as the  female  organs of generation in plants As such indeed they must be considered  analogically  and in a phi∣losophical view yet perhaps the  Linnaean  system admirable as it is would not have been less ac∣ceptable had the classical terms been expressive  only of  number  and  situation  without regard to the offices of the parts in framing the terms  Ludwig  of  Leipsic  who has endeavoured to com∣bine the systems of  Rivinus  and LINNAEUS by taking his  classes  from the method of the former and his  orders  from that of the latter has avoided this mode of expression in substituting the terms  monantherae monostylae  c c  The author begins the new and enlarged edition of the  Systema Vegetabilium  of by premising a compendious view of the philosophy of vege∣tation and then proceeds to what he calls  Delineatio Plantae  something analogous to what he had en∣titled in the editions prior to the th  Methodus Demonstrandi Vegetabilia  Here he introduces all the terms he makes use of in describing plants and by a methodical and apt disposition of them really explains them at the same time After this he gives the  Clavis et Characteres Classium  and then comes to the system itself  The prerogative of any artificial system in botany  is supposed  to consist in its keeping toge∣ther as much as possible the  genera  in what are called the  natural classes  or orders and thus so far approaching to the system of nature All  artificial  systems being founded on  some  or  other  or  all  the parts of  fructification  without regard to  habit  will be found in many instances to break the order of the  natural  classes and disjoin  genera  which nature seems to have classed The more simple and uniform the classical characters of any system are the more they are likely to interfere in this respect nevertheless it is pleasing to observe how  well many of the  natural  classes are kept together in the  Linnaean  system the characters of which enjoy the advantage of being very simple and easy to retain in the memory and of being found∣ed on the parts of plants as little subject to vari∣ation as any whatever yet like all other me∣thods it has its defects of which no one was more sensible than the author himself There are many instances of particular species that break through the  generical  and classical characters of the system itself but for these defects there is no other remedy at present than that which our au∣thor has applied in the volume under considera∣tion and which ought ever in arrangements of this kind to be rigidly observed Wherever these  anomalies  take place they are mentioned among the  fictitious  characters under the class and order to which the  number  of  stamina  or  pistils  entitle them to a place  The  sexual  system briefly is as followsAll known plants are divided into CLASSES the characters of which are established upon the  num∣ber  or different situation or arrangement of the  stamina  or male organs and the ORDERS or sub∣divisions of these classes as far as possible on a similar number situation or arrangement of the  pistils  or female organs  The first twenty classes contain what the author calls  hermaphrodite  flowers or such as have the  sta∣mina  and  pistils  both within the same  cup  or  petals  or standing on the same  receptacle  where those are wanting Of these twenty the first  ten  classes pro∣ceed in an uninterrupted series from MONAN∣DRIA  to DECANDRIA the plants of each having as many stamina as the title expresses  The th class is DODECANDRIA as there are no plants yet discovered which have only eleven stamina  The th ICOSANDRIA such plants as have about stamina or more but always arising from the  calyx  or  corolla  and not from the  recep∣tacle  The th POLYANDRIA such as have from twenty to even a thousand stamina but always arising from the  receptacle  The th class DIDYNAMIA such as have  four  stamina two long and two short The essential character of this class does not consist in the  num∣ber  of stamina otherwise the plants might be re∣ferred to the  tetrandria  class but in having two of the stamina shorter than the other one pistil only and an irregularlyshaped corolla  The th TETRADYNAMIA plants with  six  sta∣mina four long and two short  The th MONADELPHIA such as have the stamina not distinct at the base but united into one body  The th DIADELPHIA such as have the sta∣mina united at the base into two bodies  The th POLYADELPHIA such as have the stamina united at the base into several bodies  The th SYNGENESIA such as have the  anthe∣rae  but not the filaments coalescing together so as to form a tube or cylinder through which the pistil is commonly transmitted  The th GYNANDRIA such as have the sta∣mina springing from the pistil itself  The st MONOECIA such as have separate male and female flowers on the same plant  The d DIOECIA such as have separate male and female flowers on separate plants  The d POLYGAMIA such as have constantly besides hermaphrodite flowers others either male or female on the same plant  The th CRYPTOGAMIA containing those plants the mode and organs of whose fructification are not yet sufficiently ascertained heretofore called imperfect plants  The secondary part of the system the OR∣DERS or subdivisions of the foregoing classes are established on the  number  of the  pistils  or female parts through a considerable part of the system but in other parts from various characters Thus  The arrangement from number is pursued no farther than through the first thirteen classes that is so long as the  classical  character uninterrup∣tedly depends on the  number  of  stamina  so long the  orders  likewise depend on the  number  of  pistils  but when  situation  or different  arrangement  take place the  orders  are most commonly founded on other distinctions which we shall briefly specify  The th class or  Didynamia  is divided into GYMNOSPERMIA and ANGIOSPERMIA the former having four naked seeds the latter having the seeds inclosed in a seedvessel  The th  Tetradynamia  has two orders accor∣ding  to the size and shape of the  pod  or  shale  SI∣LICULOSA short and SILIQUOSA long  The orders in the three next classes  Monadel∣phia Diadelphia  and  Polyadelphia  are formed from the NUMBER of the  stamina  Those of the  Syngenesia  class are six in five of which the plants are POLYGAMIAE and in the remaining one MONOGAMIAE and the differences in the orders of the former arise from the different structure or sex of the  floscules  constituting the whole flower  In the th class  Gynandria  the arrangement of the orders arises from the NUMBER of the  sta∣mina  as in the th th and th classes  In the st and d classes the  Monoecia  and  Dioecia  the classical characters of the foregoing parts of the system are adopted as characters of the  orders  as far down as to the  Monoecia  class it∣self Thus the first order of those classes contains MONANDROUS plants and the last GYNANDROUS  The d the  Polygamia  class is divided into three orders as the plants are MONOECIOUS DIOE∣CIOUS or TRIOECIOUS  The th and last class  Cryptogamia  is divided into four orders containing the FILICES MUSCI ALGAE and FUNGI  Some Examples of Plants throughout all the Classes and Orders of the Linnaean System specifying also the Number of Genera under each Order and the Number of Species in each Class synonymed in the Species Plantarum  Cl MONANDRIA species  Monogynia  Genera among

together according to their  number figure pro∣portion  and  situation  Of these we have spoken before as they constitute a large volume in oc∣tavo to which we refer  But besides these NATURAL CHARACTERS or GENERA at large our author has invented for brevity's sake two other kinds of characters which he calls FACTITIOUS and ESSENTIAL The former serve to distinguish each genus from other  genera  of the same  artificial  order only by enume∣rating the most remarkable differences these greatly facilitate the labour of a young botanist The ESSENTIAL characters could they be rendered perfect are designed to distinguish the  genera  from each other in the  natural  orders but they are not complete as yet except in a few instances and  possibly they exist but in a small number never∣theless they are attempted through the whole system to save the trouble of turning over the  na∣tural characters  at large  As this volume was intended to contain all the plants hitherto known consequently the  natural  characters could not be introduced but the  fic∣titious  and  essential  ones are placed the former at the head of each  class  and the latter before each  genus  With each generical name the author refers to the number where it is exhibited at large in the last edition of the  Genera Plantarum  in and to the page of the  Species Plantarum  of where the species are detailed and the  sy∣nonyms  added as he gives in this volume only the specific name invented by himself  In forming the last branch of the system the SPECIFIC names LINNAEUS has done more than all the writers on the subject had done before him and taken the utmost pains to fix them upon distinctions as permanent and invariable as pos∣sible This is indeed the ultimate object of all method and on this plan he has given new  spe∣cific  names to all the plants that have come to his knowledge names not taken as had been cus∣tomary before from that of the discoverer the likeness of the plant to other species place of growth time of flowering its size the colour of the flower or of the plant smell taste or vir∣tues in medicine or any other such vague in∣definite or mutable circumstance but from some remarkable difference in the root trunk  stalk and particularly the leaf foliation ramifica∣tion or some other abiding distinction  Besides these  specific  names or descriptions LIN∣NAEUS has invented and in all his works after the first edition of the  Species Plantarum  in has applied what he calls TRIVIAL names to each plant consisting of a single adjunct to the generical name expressive if possible of some essential dis∣tinction of the species as for instance  integrifo∣lia laciniata erecta repens aquatica montana  c sometimes of the name of the inventor and where from the laws of his  Fundamenta Botanica  he has been obliged to change the generical name of a plant well known before and especially if it was an  officinal  one he frequently retains the  old generical  name as his  trivial  epithet Thus as the Pennyroyal or  Pulegium  really belongs to the  Mentha  genus according to his characters he therefore calls it  Mentha Pulegium  The Horse∣radish known by the old name  Armoracia  as it agrees with the  Cochlearia  genus he calls  Cochle∣aria Armoracia  The VARIETIES of plants which for want of fixing true  specific  characters had almost increased the number of plants double what LINNAEUS thinks they really are in this work as in the SPECIES are totally excluded Our author has indeed in the opinion of many of his contemporary botanists carried this matter too far in disallowing the name of species to many plants that are thought to have sufficiently permanent distinctions  To conclude the space of time elapsed since the publication of the  Genera  and  Species Plantarum  to∣gether  with the vast quantity of new materials ac∣quired from all parts of the world enabled our author greatly to elaborate this last edition and to amend very many  generical  and  specific  characters as also to make many removes tending greatly to the advancement and perfection of his work Among these removes many have taken place particularly in the  Monoecious Dioecious  and  Polyga∣mous  classes which is the less to be wondered at since observations have confirmed that there are plants of these classes which in their younger state have produced only male flowers afterwards both male and female and at length only female  The  Species Plantarum  contains near seven thou∣sand three hundred plants In this volume the number is augmented by the addition of new plants and such as were unknown by our author before to above seven thousand eight hundred  It is proper to remark that this second tome of the System was immediately preceded by MAN∣TISSA PLANTARUM  Generum editionis sextae et Specie∣rum editionis secundae  Holm pp in which are described as in the  Genera Plantarum  the natural characters at large of fortyfour  genera  newly constructed These are followed by an enu∣meration of upwards of four hundred and thirty new species with their synonyms as in the  Species Plantarum  All these plants are included in the volume of the System of which we have just given the account  TOM III The FOSSIL KINGDOM  We are now to accompany our author into the  Fossil  kingdom in which though he very early gave a specimen of his method of classing he did not fully exemplify as in vegetables until the year when the third tome of the th edition of the  Systema  was published containing the REGNUM LAPIDEUM This volume makes pages and is concluded with a short appendix of some unno∣ticed or not well described animals and vegetables together with a general index of the author's own  generical  names throughout every part of the System distinguishing by a different type the subjects of the three kingdoms the whole amounting to  genera  In arranging Fossils there have been various me∣thods invented each of which have had their pa∣trons and for different purposes each have their advantage Some have founded the basis of their system on the  figure colour structure  and other ex∣ternal and visible characters yet scarcely ever trusting solely to these they called in the aid of chemistry so far at least as the mineral acids would assist them Others as the professed che∣mists and metallurgists have established their ar∣rangement chiefly on  chemical principles  as more immediately leading to the  origin  of fossil bodies in general on which it must be acknowledged the best basis for a system must be built when we are happy enough to get sufficient light for this pur∣pose and at present mineralogists throughout the world seem more intent on this view than ever  and probably the due consideration and extension of the volcanic system will open new sources of information in this way  This volume begins with LINNAEUS'S own theory of the origin of fossil bodies in general and their several combinations into those forms in which we meet with them in the body of the earth The methodical and abbreviated manner in which our author has here given his  philosophy  of fossil bodies renders it incapable of an ab∣stract He then proceeds to give a synoptical or classical view of the several systems of arranging those bodies as they stand exhibited in the best authors on the subject beginning with  Bromelius  who published in and enumerates  Wal∣lerius  in  Woltersdorf  in  Cartheuser  in  Justi    Anomymus Cronstedt  in and concludes with  Vogel  in To each of these he has subjoined short remarks relating to their methods and theory of fossil bodies and concludes this introductory part with an ex∣planation of the terms of art used in his own work  In these  termini artis  our author with his usual precision has defined a set of terms equally new and curious which are principally adapted to and used in the ultimate and most difficult part of the System the specific characters They are happily framed to express all differences in the  figures  of fossil bodies in their  crust  or outward appear∣ance their  superficies  their  component particles  or  fibres  in their  texture  whether plated fissile c in their  hardness  or in their  colour  the alterations  they undergo by  solution  whether by acids or by fire  It has been doubted by some of the most respectable mineralogists whether we ought to descend below what are called  generical  distinctions in the fossil kingdom so infinitely do the subjects thereof vary and so imperceptible in general is that gradation by which they run into each other in the various combined forms in which they are found in the earth In the mean time some distinctions of this kind seem quite necessary in systems established principally on external cha∣racters Those which have for their basis the  elementary  or  constituent principles of bodies  as ana∣lyzed may stand with propriety in the form of  synoptical  tables as exemplified in  Cronstedt  's mi∣neralogy LINNAEUS and  Wallerius  were among the first who attempted the arduous task of fixing the  specific  characters whether future mineralo∣gists will adhere to and improve this part of the scheme time only must shew  In all systems of the fossil kingdom writers have been more particularly embarrassed by the  earths  and  stones  especially when those have been more or less reduced to the state of  ores  by the admixture of  metallic  principles  Salts inflamma∣bles  and  metals  generally falling more easily and almost naturally into their several classes or or∣ders The chemical systematics and metallur∣gists begin usually with the  earths  considering them as the basis of stones LINNAEUS begins with the latter professing to take a middle way between the mere  metallurgist  and those who  characterize from external appearance only He divides the whole REGNUM LAPIDEUM into three classes under the names of  Petrae Minerae  and  Fossilia  each being subdivided into several orders the whole comprehending genera We must only give a general account of his  classical  cha∣racters and those of the  orders  and enumerate the  genera  under each with some of the most dis∣tinguished  species  Class I PETRAE STONES  Fossil bodies originating from a terrene princi∣ple by cohesion  Simple  as being destitute of saline inflammable and metallic principles as

consisting of a base united with saline inflammable or metallic principles  Soluble  perfectly in the appropriate menstruum  Order I SALIA Sapid bodies soluble in water distinguished from each other by their different effects on the organs of taste  Under this order are arranged to the great of∣fence of most mineralogists all the  Gems  or pre∣cious stones notwithstanding their texture and in∣solubility as also many other lapidose chrystallized bodies To this our author tells us he was led by considering that all regular polyedrous figures or bodies in the mineral kingdom are the result of chrystallization which can only take place under re∣quisite and certain degrees of fluidity and therefore whether they are saline or lapidose chrystals they must owe their figure to the same uniform prin∣ciple operating on them in either case while in the fluid state hence from the similarity of the figure with the chrystals of nitre  Mountain Chrystal  hath a place in the same genus the  Topaz  with the  Borax  the  Diamond  and  Ruby  with  Alum  LINNAEUS hath given his reasons more at large in a paper published in the first volume of the  Amoenitates Academicae  and hath since added

CLASSIFICATION of DISEASES  WE must now look backwards a few years to consider our author in another part of his Profes∣sorial character It has been observed that after his establishment at  Upsal  one of his departments as a professor was that of teaching the  Diagnosis Morborum  and to this end he drew up a system  in which as in natural history all diseases were disposed into  classes orders  and  genera  founded on distinctions taken from the  symptoms  alone no regard being had either to remote or proximate causes Before we proceed to a particular view of LINNAEUS'S method of classing diseases it will be proper to premise that a  nosology  on this plan the great object of which is to fix  pathognomonics  to every disease had been long wished for by some writers of the first character in the profession such were  Baglivi Boerhaave Gorter Gaubius  and  Syden∣ham  the latter of whom has thus expressed himself on this subject in the preface to his works  Expe∣dit ut morbi omnes ad definitas ac certas species revo∣centur eadem prorsus diligentia ac  qua id factum videmus à botanicis scriptoribus in suis phytologiis  Yet amidst that almost infinite variety and complication of appearances which are seen in diseases the difficulty of obtaining suf∣ficient distinctions by which the  genus  and  species  may be accurately discriminated must be allowed to be very great and possibly is in many instances unsurmountable Hence some of the most emi∣nent physicians have been led to reject all such arrangements as futile and impracticable This however hath not deterred others from paying attention to the subject more especially some of those who from their province as professors are led to teach the rudiments of the art and to whom method  in some form  is absolutely neces∣sary Systematic writers had used various me∣thods in the disposition of their subject Some  had chosen the  alphabetic  if that deserves the name of an arrangement others after the ex∣ample of  Aretaeus  and  Caelius Aurelianus  had di∣vided diseases from their duration into  acute  and  chronical  Some had preferred the  anatomical  order which as it presupposes a knowledge of the seat of the disease must not unfrequently prove fallacious  Sennertus  's is an instance of this kind However the  äitiological  arrangement has been most followed by the best writers among the moderns such as  Hoffmann  and  Boerhaave  al∣though perhaps not much less fallacious than the anatomical since it is in many instances founded on an hypothesis of the writer and though  Felix Platerus  in his  Praxis Medica  published in had given an imperfect sketch of a nosology on the  symptomatic  plan yet no writer ventured to pursue his idea for more than a century after his time discouraged as it should seem by the diffi∣culty of the attempt At length the late profes∣sor M SAUVAGES of  Montpelier  after communi∣cating his scheme to  Boerhaave  published in in  mo  the outlines of such a work under the title of  Nouvelles Classes des Maladies  in which he professes to define diseases from  their constant and evident symptoms only  In the year the au∣thor augmented his work by the addition of the  species  under each  genus  into volumes in  vo    Sauvages  may be considered as having spent his life in giving to this design a certain degree of perfec∣tion having enlarged it into quarto volumes in which form it was published after his death in  A work it is to be presumed now in the hands of most physicians  It will easily be imagined that an arrangement of this kind was too congenial to LINNAEUS to be neglected by him In fact it appears that he very early corresponded with  Sauvages  on this subject that he soon adopted it and framed a set of institutes under the title of GENERA MOR∣BORUM as a basis of his lectures in this depart∣ment LINNAEUS'S scheme was first published in a  thesis  in but he had taught it in his class for ten years preceding that time In he published it himself in a small quarto though we do not find that he ever enlarged it by the addition of the  species  The  symptomatic  plan of arranging diseases has since been followed by some other professors of physic Dr  Vogel  of  Gottingen  having published in his  Definitiones Generum Morborum  Dr  Cullen  also who at this time fills the practical chair at  Edinburgh  with such deserved reputation has published a  Synopsis nosologiae methodicae  and has made it the basis of his  First Lines of the Practice of Physic  In Dr  Sagar  a physician at  Ig∣law  in  Moravia  published a  Systema Morborum sym∣tomaticum  vo  Vien  pp His work allow∣ing for some alterations and additions may be ac∣counted an useful abridgement of  Sauvages  's the author all theory apart has described the  species  under every  genus  and subjoined the method of cure Dr  Cullen  by omitting many  genera  and reducing others to the rank of  species  only has so  considerably abridged the whole as not to have retained more than half the number of  genera  that the foregoing writers enumerate and in this form he has published it annexed to those of the four abovementiond by which display of each their several merits may be compared and a judg∣ment formed of the practicability and use of the scheme in general which it must be confessed af∣fords a very ample field for cultivation yet from that reform which Dr  Cullen  has already made in various parts it is not perhaps too much to hope that it is capable of receiving a much higher degree of improvement in the hands of those whose genius and industry may prompt them to extend the design of these writers  Of LINNAEUS'S method we are led by our plan to exhibit a general view to which end although our prescribed brevity will not admit of giving his  definitions  at length yet it will be necessary to enumerate the  names  of all his  genera  since no∣thing short of a view of the whole collectively could enable the reader to form a just idea of the author's scheme Under each  class  we shall ob∣serve wherein LINNAEUS differs materially from  Sauvages  and note the alterations which Dr  Cullen  has made in the disposition of the same  genera  LINNAEUS in the classification of diseases has pretty nearly retained the arrangement of M  Sau∣vages  although he has altered his terms and con∣stituted one more class with which he begins his method the  Exanthematic  or eruptive fevers which in the systems of  Sauvages  and Dr  Cullen  form only an  order  or subdivision of a class He has also changed the order of the classes and re∣ferred the  Vitia  or  local external disorders  which are principally the objects of surgery to the end of his system In this he has been followed by the two succeeding nosologists Dr  Vogel  and Dr  Cullen  The classical distribution is however confessedly not the  primary  consideration that of fixing the  generical  character and determining what shall constitute the  specifical  being the first object of every system To this end a still farther reduction of the number of  genera  and  species  will probably not a little contribute  Class I EXANTHEMATICI Fevers attended with eruptions on the skin  CONTAGIOSI Contagious  Morta  Vesiculary Fe∣ver  Pestis  The Plague  Variola  Small pox  Rubeola  Measles  Petechia  Spotted Fe∣ver  Siphylis  Venereal Dis∣ease  SPORADICI Sporadic fevers not conta∣gious  Miliaria  Miliary Fe∣ver  Uredo  Nettle Fever  Aphtha  Aphthous Fe∣ver  SOLITARII Affecting a part of the body only  Erysipelas  St Anthony's Fire  In this class as the disease is complicated of fever and eruption the genus is defined from the nature of each To instance the  Variola  or Small pox is defined  A disease attended with pus∣tules of an erysipelatous suppurating escha∣rotic kind at length drying off and leaving a cicatrix accompanied by a fever of the ardent and malignant kind with headach and pain of the loins  The term  Pustula  and the others in this class expressive of the different kinds of eruption have their definition in another part of the system Such as appear in the Morta are called  Phlyctenae  in the Pestis  Anthraces  or  Bu∣bones  in the Variola  Pustulae  in the Rubeola  Papulae  in the Petechia  Sudamina  This class constitutes the first  order  of Dr  Sau∣vages  's PHLEGMASIAE and the third of Dr  Cullen  's PYREXIAE class In both these  genera  are preserved nearly alike except that the  Morta  of LINNAEUS is the  Pemphigus  of those authors and the  Petechia  is considered by Dr  Cullen  as only a  symptom  Our author stands alone in bringing the  Syphilis  into the febrile exanthematic class He thinks himself justified by considering it as attended in the advanced state at least by fever and eruptions It certainly however ranks better with the IM∣PETIGINES  Class II CRITICI Critical Fevers  CONTINENTES Continual Fevers  Diaria  Diary Fever  Synocha  Ardent Fever  Synochus  Malig∣nant Fever  Lenta  Slow Fever  INTERMITTENTES Intermitting Fevers  Quotidiana  Quoti∣dian  Tertiana  Tertian  Quartana  Quartan  Duplicana  Double Tertian  Errana  Erratic Fe∣ver  EXACERBANTES Remitting Fevers  Amphimerina  Con∣tinued Quotidian  Tritaeus  Continued Tertian  Tetartophya  Con∣tinued Quartan  Haemitritaea  SemiTertian  Hectica  Hectic Fe∣ver  The  Genera  of the CONTINENTES are determin∣ed from the different duration of each simply  Those of the INTERMITTENTES from the dura∣tion of the intermissions  The EXACERBANTES supposed to be compound∣ed of the two foregoing have their characters acordingly  Our author allows the  Tertian  to be the root of all the FEBRES CRITICI although he has in the foregoing division kept pretty close to Dr  Sauvages  's method in retaining the distinctions In this they are not followed by Dr  Cullen  who denies the existence of a  continent  fever and has greatly simplified this division having reduced all the CRITICAL  fevers  to six genera and allowing the  Hectic  to be  symptomatic  only  Class III PHLOGISTICI Inflammations  MEMBRANACEI Membranous Inflamma∣tions  Phrenitis  Of the Meninges of the Brain  Paraphrenitis  Of the Diaphragm  Pleuritis  The Pleu∣risy  Gastritis  Of the Sto∣mach  Enteritis  Of the Bowels  Proctitis  Of the Anus  Cystitis  Of the Bladder  PARENCHYMATICI Visceral Inflammations  Sphacelismus  Of the Brain  Cynanche  Quinsey  Peripneumonia  Of the Lungs  Hepatitis  Of the Liver  Splenitis  Of the Spleen  Nephritis  Of the Kidneys  Hysteritis  Of the Uterus  MUSCULORI Muscular or external Inflam∣mation  Phlegmone  In∣flammation of an external part  LINNAEUS defines the  Phlegmon  to be  a tense throbbing tumour or enlargement of a part accompanied by fever and attended with heat and redness  This he considers as suggest∣ing also the idea of all the foregoing internal in∣flammations  The generical character in the  Phlogistic  class of our author does not arise wholly from the part affected supposed to be the seat of the disease but from the  genus  of the attending fever also Thus he defines  the  Hepatitis  to be the  Amphi∣merina  attended with a difficult respiration cough without expectoration hiccup and a sense of heat and tension in the right  hypo∣chondre  The  Nephritis  is a  Synochus  attend∣ed with nausea hiccup eructation urine vari∣ous costiveness burning lumbago and numb∣ness down the thigh  In this class LINNAEUS has followed  Sauvages  in dividing the diseases into MEMBRANACEI and PARENCHYMATICI a division neglected by Dr  Cullen  from the difficulty of determining the seat of the inflammation  The  Phlegmone  being external is ranked by  Sauvages  among his VITIA On the other hand Dr  Cullen  gives it the first place in his  order  PHLEG∣MASIAE and has reduced thirteen  genera  of LIN∣NAEUS'S and twelve of  Sauvages  's to the rank of  species  under the term  Phlogosis  further account∣ing  Abscess Pustule Gangrene  and  Sphacelus  as effects only of  Phlogosis  and therefore not entitled  to the separate character of  genera  Numerous instances of this kind afford a striking proof of the difficulties attending these arrangements in de∣termining what distinctions shall take place be∣tween  genus  and  species  Class IV DOLORES Painful Diseases  INTRINSECI Of the internal Parts  Cephalalgia  Head∣ach  Hemicrania  Me∣grim  or pain of one side of the head only  Gravedo  Dull pain of the Forehead  Ophthalmia  Pain of the Eye  Otalgia  Earach  Odontalgia  Tooth∣ach  Angina  Pain in the Fauces with a sense of choaking  Soda  Burning pain in the Throat with rancid Eructations  Cardialgia  Pain at the Heart  Gastrica  Pain of the Stomach  Colica  Colic  Hepatica  Pain of the right Hypo∣chondre  Splenica  of the left Hypochondre  Pleuritica  Pain of the Side  Pneumonica  Weight or load on the Chest  Hysteralgia  Pain of the Uterus  Nephritica  Pain of the Kidneys  Dysuria  Pain in the Bladder  Pudendagra  Pain in the genital Parts  Proctica  Pain of the Anus  EXTRINSECI Of the Limbs  Arthritis  The Gout  Ostocopus  Fixed Pain in the Bones  Rheumatismus  The Rheumatism  Volatica  Flying Pain of the Limbs  Pruritus  Excessive Itching  Our author does not take into the characters of these  genera  the idea of fever and there are several of them used by him as auxiliary terms in the de∣finition of other  genera  Dr  Sauvages  has a class of five orders under the term DOLORES disposed in the anatomical method under which most of the foregoing  genera  are comprehended  Dr  Cullen  having no such class as the DOLO∣ROSI is necessarily led to arrange these  genera  in different parts of his system but with him the greater number are either  species  only or symptoms he having admitted only three to the character of  genera  in his PHLEGMASIA These are the  Oph∣thalmia Arthritis  or Podagra and  Rheumatismus  Class V MENTALES Diseases in which the Functions of the Mind are disturbed  IDEALES Those in which the Judgment is principally affected  Delirium  Sympto∣matic or febrile Delirium  Paraphrosyne  Tran∣sitory Insanity with∣out Fever  Amentia  Idiotic Insanity  Mania  Madness  Demonia  Melan∣choly with Idea of Possession  Vesania  Tranquil partial Melancholy  Melancholia  Fixed Melancholy  IMAGINARII Those in which the Imagi∣nation is principally affected  Syringmos  Imagi∣nary Sound in the Ear  Phantasma  False Vision  Vertigo  Giddiness  or  false Idea of Gyration in Objects  Panophobia  False fear of Evil  Hypochondriasis  Hypochondriac Dis∣ease  Somnambulismus  Nightwalking or Noctambulation  PATHETICI Those in which the Appetites and Passions are principally affected  Citta  Unnatural Longings  Bulimia  Voracious Appetite  Polydipsia  Exces∣sive Thirst  Satyriasis  Erotomania  Nostalgia  Swiss Ma∣lady  Tarantismus  Rabies  Canine Mad∣ness  Hydrophobia  Hor∣ror of Drinking  with  Rigor  and  Sardiasis  Cacositia  Fixed A∣version to Food  Antipathia  Aversion to particular Objects  Anxietas  Restlessness  In this class which answers to the VESANIAE of Dr  Sauvages  the  genera  stand nearly the same as in that author's arrangement  They constitute after great reduction the fourth  order  under the term VESANIAE of the class NEUROSES in Dr  Cullen  's system com∣prehending four  genera  Of the IDEALES of LINNAEUS Dr  Cullen  only ranks the  Amentia  the  Mania  and the  Melancholia  as  genera  the  Delirium  and  Paraphrosyne  being symp∣tomatic The  Demonia Vesania  and  Panopho∣bia  rank with  Melancholy  under which he has also brought the  Erotomania  and  Nostalgia  from the PATHETICI Of the remaining  genera  only the  Hypochondriasis  and the  Hydrophobia  are ad∣mitted as such the former in the ADYNAMIAE and the latter among the SPASMI The  Syrigmus  and  Phantasma  are referred to the LOCALES class and the  Somnambulismus  to the  Oneirodynia  in the  order  VESANIAE The  Citta  or  Pica  the  Polydipsia Satyriasis  and  Bulimia  belong also to the LOCALES in the  order  DYSOREXIAE It is justly doubted whether the  Tarantismus  exists and the  Rabies  can scarcely be separated from the  Hydrophobia  Class VI QUIETALES Diseases in which the voluntary and involuntary Motions and the Senses suffer a Diminution  DEFECTIVI Defects of the vital Powers  Lassitudo  Muscular Debility  Languor  Debility of Spirits  Asthenia  Extreme Debility  Lipothymia  Faint∣ing  Syncope  Swooning  Asphyxia L  ong fai∣lure of vital and animal Power  as from  Drowning Mephitism c  SOPOROSI Soporose Affections or Di∣minution of Sense and Motion  Somnolentia  Som∣nolency  Typhomania  Coma Vigil  of authors  Lethargus  Lethar∣gy  febrile Som∣nolency  Cataphora  Coma Somnolentum  of authors  Carus  Sopor and Insensibility with quiet Respiration  Apoplexia  Apo∣plexy Sopor and Insensibility with Snoring  Paraplegia  Palsy of all the Limbs  Hemiplegia  Palsy of one Side  Paralysis  Palsy of a particular Part  Stupor  Transitory Numbness  PRIVATIVI Diminutions of the Senses  Morosis  Defect of Imagination  Oblivio  Defect of Memory  Amblyopia  Ob∣scure Vision without apparent Defect in the Organ  Cataracta  Priva∣tion of Sight with apparent Defect in the Organ  Amaurosis  Priva∣tion of Sight with∣out apparent Defect of the Organ  Scotomia  Transitory Blindness  Cophosis  Deaf∣ness  Anosmia  Defect of Smelling  Ageustia  Defect of Taste  Aphonia  Defect of Voice  Anorexia  Want of Appetite  Adipsia  Want of Thirst  Anaesthesia  Defect of Feeling  Atecnia  Defect of venereal Appetite  Atonia  Atony Defect of muscular Power  The diseases of this class very nearly correspond with the DEBILITATES of  Sauvages  and the two first  orders  the DEFECTIVI and SOPOROSI with the COMATA and ADYNAMIAE of the class NEUROSES in Dr  Cullen  's system  The three first  genera  of the DEFECTIVI Dr▪  Cullen  takes no notice of the three last he in∣cludes under his  Syncope  as different degrees only of the same diminished power of the functions  Among the SOPOROSI of our author Dr  Cullen  ranks the  Carus  and  Cataphora  under the  Apo∣plexia  and also considers the  Typhomania  and  Le∣thargus  as symptomatic of the same For the like reasons he accounts the  Paraplegia  and  Hemiple∣gia  as different degrees of the same disease in∣cluding them all under  Paralysis  The PRIVATIVI rank under the two first  orders  of Dr  Cullen  's LOCALES as far as he allows them to hold the character of  genera  The  Morosis  and  Oblivio  he refers to his  Amentia  The  Scoto∣mia  he does not notice The  Cophosis  he calls  Dysoecia  the  Anorexia  stands under his  Dyspepsia  genus among the ADYNAMIAE the  Atonia  as a  species  of  Palsy  The  Amblyopia  under  Amaurosis  the  Cataracta  under his  Caligo  The  Anosmia Ageustia Aphonia Anosexia Adipsia  and  Anaesthe∣sia  under their respective names separately and the  Atecnia  under that of  Anaphrodisia  Class VII MOTORII Spasmodic Diseases Diseases attended with involuntary Motion  SPASTICI Spastic or Tonic Diseases  Spasmus  Cramp  Priapismus  Pria∣pism  Borborygmi  Rum∣bling of the Bowels  Trismos  Locked Jaw  Sardiasis  Involun∣tary or convulsive Laughing  Hysteria  Hysteric Affection  Tetanos  Rigidity of the Spine with Sensibility  Catochus  Rigidity of the Body with∣out Sensibility  Catalepsis  Cata∣lepsy  Agrypnia  Intense

attend∣ed with Insensibility  opposed to the foregoing  Hieranosos  Conti∣nued Convulsions without Pain or Loss of Sensibility  Raphania  Spastic Contraction of the Limbs with Con∣vulsions and Pain  Most of the diseases of this class stand in the corrseponding one of  Sauvages  called SPASMI except the  Borborygmus  and the  Agrypnia  the lat∣ter of which is referred to the anomalous VESA∣NIAE He also considers the  Sardiasis  and  Stridor  of LINNAEUS as species only of the  Trismos  and the  Subsultus  he calls  Carpologia  In Dr  Cullen  's system the MOTORII of LIN∣NAEUS make the third  order  of his NEUROSES called SPASMI Of the  Spastici  he has the  Trismos Hysteria  and  Tetanos  only as distinct  genera  un∣der their respective terms The  Catochus  he refers to the  Tetanos  and the  Catalepsis  is his  Apoplexia Cataleptica  The others are not noticed by him  Of the AGITATORII the  Tremor  Dr  Cullen  ac∣counts rather as a symptom of various disorders The  Beriberi  which he had heretofore ranked with  the  Paralysis  he has omitted in the last edition of his  Synopsis  the  Chorea  is admitted as a genus and the  Hieranosos  stands under the idiopathic  Convul∣sio  The  Psellismus  is removed to the LOCALES class and of the remainder the  Palpitatio Epi∣lepsia  and  Raphania  only retain their place in his system under their respective names  Class VIII SUPPRESSORII Affections and Diseases arising from or attended with Oppres∣sion of the Organs and impeded Excretions  SUFFOCATORII Diseases attended with a Sense of Suffocation  Raucedo  Hoarse∣ness  Vociferatio  Squeal∣ing  Risus  Laughing  Fletus  Weeping  Suspirium  Sighing  Oscitatio  Yawn∣ing  Pandiculatio  Stretching  Singultus  Hiccup  Sternutatio  Sneez∣ing  Tussis  Coughing  Stertor  Snoring  Anhelatio  Pant∣ing  Suffocatio  Difficult Respiration from Narrowness of the Fauces  Empyema  from an Abscess in the Thorax  Dyspnoea  Labori∣ous panting Respi∣ration without a Sense of Narrow∣ness in the Fauces  Asthma  Chronic laborious wheez∣ing Respiration  Orthopnoea  Acute sighing suffocating Respiration  Ephialtes  Night∣mare  CONSTRICTORII Diseases attended with Constriction  Aglutitio  Impeded Deglutition  Flatulentia  Fla∣tulence  Obstipatio  Cos∣tiveness  Ischuria  Impeded or suppressed Mic∣turition  Dysmenorrhoea  Suppression of the Menses  Dyslochia  Suppres∣sion of the Lochia  Aglactatio  Defect of Milk  Sterilitas  Barren∣ness  Under the  genera  of the SUFFOCATORII our au∣thor has departed from his usual rule in having subjoined to each a note expressive of the intention of Nature in exciting these affections Thus to instance after defining  Suspirium  to be  a deep slow agitating inspiration  he adds that the effect is  "that of expelling the blood from the lungs"  Most of the SUFFOCATORII have a place in  Sau∣vages  's system among the ANHELATIONES but the CONSTRICTORII are scattered in various parts of his system  Dr  Cullen  hath not introduced into his system the lighter affections under the SUFFOCATORII which seem to have been defined and explained by LINNAEUS principally to use them as auxili∣aries in other parts of the work  In Dr  Cullen  's system the  Raucedo  has a place as symptomatic only under the Catarrh and again in another part as a species of  Para∣phonia  The  Tussis  is also received under the Ca∣tarrh and the  Empyema  is considered as a conse∣quence of Pleurisy or Peripneumony The  Ortho∣pnoea  as a  genus  is not noticed by Dr  Cullen  The  Dyspnoea  is admitted in the last edition which with the  Asthma  are the only  genera  he receives from this  order  as he has made the  Ephialtes  a species of his  Oncirodynia  under the VESANIAE in the class NEUROSES  In the CONSTRICTORII order the  Flatulentia  of LINNAEUS comes under the  Dyspepsia  of Dr  Cullen  and the  Obstipatio Ischuria  and  Dysmenor∣rhoea  enter into the fourth  order  of the LOCA∣LES called EPISCHESES the latter under the term  Amenorrhaea  Class IX EVACUATORII Diseases attended with increased Excretion and Discharges  CAPITIS Of the Head  Otorrhoea  Puru∣lent Discharge from the Ear  Epiphora  Lachry∣mal Flux  Haemorrhagia  Bleeding of the Nose  Coryza  Mucous Discharge from the Nose  Stomocace  Bleed∣ing of the Gums  Ptyalismus  Saliva∣tion  THORACIS Of the Breast  Screatus  Hawking  Expectoratio  Ex∣pectoration

Bloody Flux without Co∣lic  Dysenteria  Bloody Flux with Colic and Tenesmus  Haemorrhois  Bleed∣ing Piles  Tenesmus  Need∣ing and frequent Dejection of Mucus  Crepitus  Dejection of Flatus  GENITALIUM Of the Genital Passages  Enuresis  Involun∣tary Micturition  Stranguria  Stran∣gury  Diabetes  Diabetes  Haematuria  Bloody Urine  Glus  Mucous U∣rine  Gonorrhoea  Gleet Mucous Flux from the Urethra  Leucorrhoea  Whites  Menorrhagia  Inor∣dinate Flux of the Menses  Parturitio  Labo∣rious Parturition  Abortus  Abor∣tion  Mola  False Con∣ception  CORPORIS EXTERNI Of external Parts  Galactitia  Over∣flowing of Milk  Sudor  Inordinate Sweating  This class stands nearly the same as our au∣thor found it in  Sauvages  's arrangement under the term FLUXUS except that LINNAEUS has introduced three or four  genera  not in that author such are the  Screatus Vomica  which is a species of  Sauvages  's  Anacatharsis  the  Ructus Glus  a spe∣cies of his  Pyuria Parturitio  and  Mola  He has also taken his  orders  from the anatomical division of the parts whereas  Sauvages  divides them accord∣ing to the nature of the discharge whether bloody or serous which must be allowed to be equivocal in many instances It has been objected that  Par∣turition  is not a disease LINNAEUS however seems only to consider it as such when it proves labori∣ous protracted or unnatural  Dr  Cullen  does not admit more than about a third part of the diseases of this class into his sys∣tem He has the  Epiphora Ptyalismus Enuresis  and  Gonorrhoea  under their respective names in an  order  called APOCENOSES belonging to the class LOCALES  Haemorrhagia  is synonymous to his  Epistaxis Coryza  to his  Catarrhus  under which he considers  Expectoratio  as only symptoma∣tic and  Vomica  as the effect of Pleurisy or Peri∣pneumony  Nausea  and  Vomitus  come under  Dys∣pepsia  the  Iliaca  under  Colica  the  Cholerica Coe∣liaca  and  Lienteria  as different species of  Diar∣rhoea  Leucorrhoea  and  Abortus  under  Menor∣rhagia Stomacace Haematemesis  and  Haematuria  as symptomatic only  Haemoptysis Cholera  and  Haemorrhois  form distinct  genera  in both systems  Class X DEFORMES Diseases occasioning external Deformity of the Body  EMACIANTES Such as emaciate the Body  Phthisis  Consump∣tion  Wasting with hectic Fever Dys∣pnoea and puru∣lent Expectora∣tion  Tabes  Wasting  with hectic Fe∣ver but without Expectoration  Atrophia  Atro∣phy  Wasting with Atony without Hectic or Ex∣pectoration  Marasmus  Wast∣ing  without Ato∣ny Hectic or Ex∣pectoration  Rachitis  Rickets  Wasting of the Flesh with En∣largement of the Head and Joints attended some∣times with Flexi∣lity of the Bones  TUMIDOSI Such as enlarge the Body or Parts thereof  Polysarcia  Corpu∣lency  Leucophlegmatia  Emphysematose In∣tumescence  Anasarca  Oedema∣tose Intumescence  Hydrocephalus  Oedematose Enlarge∣ment of the Head with Gaping of the Sutures  Ascites  Dropsy Oedematous En∣largement of the Abdomen  Hyposarca  Fixed partial Tumour of the Abdomen  Tympanites  WindDropsy  Graviditas  Extra∣ordinary Distention of the Abdomen du∣ring Pregnancy  DECOLORES Such as deform and change the Colour of the Skin  Cachexia  Cachexy  Oedematose Pale∣ness  Chlorosis  Green∣sickness  Scorbutus  Scurvy  Icterus  Jaundice  Plethora  Redness of the Skin from Fullness of Blood attended with Dys∣pnoea  This class answers to the CACHEXIAE of  Sau∣vages  and Dr  Cullen  and most of the  genera  are admitted into the system of the latter under three corresponding orders also The  Marasmus  is not distinguished by Dr  Cullen  from the  Atrophy  The  Phthisis  has been classed before as the consequence of  Haemoptysis  The  Chlorosis  stands in the ADY∣NAMIAE order in the class NEUROSES The  Graviditas Cachexia  and  Plethora  have no place in Dr  Cullen  's system  Class XI VITIA Cutaneous external or pal∣pable Diseases  The class which corresponds to this in the  Sau∣vagesian  system stands first under the same term  and is there professedly intended to contain such disorders as are more immediately the objects of surgery This character is not so strictly appli∣cable to that of LINNAEUS'S or of Dr  Cullen  's LOCALES since both these contain  genera  which come under the province of the physician inde∣pendent of manual operation or assistance In all the systems it is the most comprehensive class The congruity of the orders will be noted in our progress through the class  HUMORALIA Diseases attended with vi∣tiated or extravasated Fluids  Aridura  Wasting and

Sphace∣lus  or  Necrosis  belong to his class of CA∣CHEXIAE The  Digitium  is a species of his  Pa∣ronychia  and stands with the remaining  genera  of this order among the VITIA  Dr  Cullen  neglects the  Aridura  and  Digitium  the  Emphysema  is his  Pneumatosis  the  Sugillatio  his  Ecchymoma  and the four remaining  genera  of LINNAEUS come under his  Phlogosis  DIALYTICA Solutions of

system called PLAGAE and the seventh of the LOCALES class in Dr  Cullen  's under the name of DIALYSES Under  Vulnus  are comprehended the three succeed∣ing  genera  also of LINNAEUS'S The  Fractura  consti∣tutes a separate genus the  Luxatura  belongs to the ECTOPIAE order of Dr  Cullen  's the  Profusio  to the APOCENOSES the  Intertrigo  and  Combustura  to the PHLOGOSIS genus the remaining  genera  are not noticed in the  Cullenian  system  EXULCERATIONES Ulcers purulent or ichorous Solutions of Continuity  Ulcus  A suppu∣rated Wound of a fleshy Part  Cacöethes  A spreading superfi∣cial

Phleg∣mon of the Finger End from the ef∣fect of Cold  Arctura  Inflam∣mation of the Nail from Curvature thereof  Most of these  genera  rank with the PLAGAE of Dr  Sauvages  's class The  Paronychia  however comes in among the PHYMATA and the  Pressura  and  Arctura  of LINNAEUS are species only of the  Paro∣nychia  as the  Pernio  is of the  Erythema  in the same system  The first six  genera  in this  order  are classed in Dr  Cullen  's system under  Ulcus  the  Caries  is a distinct genus the  Arthocace Paronychia  and  Pernio  rank under the  Phlogosis  and the others are not noticed

Tinea  and  Psora  are referred to the IMPETIGINES in the class CACHEXIAE  The following are distinct  genera  in Dr  Cullen  's system the  Lepra  under the IMPETIGINES the  Tinea Psora  and  Herpes  under the DIALYSES The  Bubo Verruca  and  Clavus  form distinct  ge∣nera  in the same  order  with the  Phlyctena  or  Hydatis  being all referred to the TUMORES Almost all the others rank under the  Phlogosis  as different species of that genus  Lippitudo Serpigo Myrmecium  and  Eschara  have no place in the  Cullenian  system  The characters of the  genera  in this order are well adapted to distinguish the different kinds of  Pustules  and are of great use as auxiliary terms in defining other  genera  in different parts of the system  TUMORES Tumours  Aneurisma  Aneu∣rism  Varix  Varix

first and the last of these  genera  stand in the corresponding class of the systems of  Sauvages  and Dr  Cullen  under the same names LINNAEUS'S  Struma  is their  Scrofula  and his  Spi∣nola  the  Hydrorachitis  The  Atheroma  is the  Lupia  of Dr  Cullen  The  Ganglion  is a  Condyloma  of  Sau∣vages  but stands in the  Cullenian  system under LINNAEUS'S term The  Natta  is neglected by Dr  Cullen  but belongs to the  Sarcoma  of our other nosologist  PROCIDENTIAE Tumours arising from Dis∣location of fleshy or membranous Parts  Hernia  Rupture  Prolapsus  Pro∣lapsus  Condyloma

the  Hernia  and  Prolapsus  The  Sarcoma  he refers to the TUMORES and the other  genera  are not admitted into his system as such  DEFORMATIONES Distortions of particu∣lar Parts and other

should seem among spasmodic diseases the  Gibber  or  Gibbosites  and the  Lordosis  among the EXCRESCENTIAE of the VITIA class the  Nyctalo∣pia  and the two  genera  succeeding it as species of  Amblyopia  in the class of DEBILITATES as is the  Lagostoma  as a species of  Psellismus  the  Plica  under the name of  Trichoma  with the CA∣CHEXIAE and the  Trichiasis  as a species of  Op∣thalmia  Dr  Cullen  receives only five of these  genera  the  Contractura Strabismus  the  Presbytia  and  My∣opia  the two latter as species of his  Dysopia  all under the LOCALES class the  Plica  under his genus  Trichoma  among the IMPETIGINES in the CACHEXIAE class  MACULAE Blemishes on the Skin  Cicatrix  A Scar  Naevus  A Mole  Morphaea  Scurf  Vibex  Purple Spots and Wheals  under the Skin  Sudamen

lighter affections stand in  Sauvages  's sys∣tem either among the MACULAE or EFFLORESCEN∣TIAE but he does not allow them all the rank of  genera  The  Cicatrix  is a  species  of his  Leucoma  as the  Morphaea  and  Melasma  are of his  Vitiligo  and the  Vibex  and  Sudamen  of the  Ecchymoma  The  Naevus  stands under the same generic name in both but the  Lentigo  of LINNAEUS is a species of  Sauvages  's  Ephelis  Dr  Cullen  has not given a place to these  genera  in his system  Our author has subjoined to this distribution of diseases a brief view of his  Theory of Physic  de∣livered in that terse concise and methodic man∣ner so peculiar to himself and which as it ap∣pears to have been intended entirely for the use of his pupils nothing less than the author's own comment can do sufficient justice to We should not therefore have taken notice of it in our plan had it not been necessary in order to explain several  papers hereafter to be mentioned in the  Amoenitates Academicae  Briefly therefore the  Linnaean  prin∣ciples of physic suppose the human body to consist of a  cerebrose medullary  part of which the nerves are so many processes and which we call the  ner∣vous  system and a  cortical  or vital part includ∣ing the  vascular  system and contained fluids the former being the animated part or that in which the  sentient  moving principle peculiarly resides is considered as deriving its  nourishment  from the subtlest fluids of the vascular system and its  energy  from an electrical principle inhaled by the lungs Farther this theory supposes the cir∣culating fluids to be capable of being vitiated by principles which the author chuses to consider either as  acescent  or  putrid  ferments the former acting on the  serum  and being the exciting cause of  critical  fevers the latter on the blood pro∣perly or  crassamentum  and exciting  phlogistic  dis∣eases The  exanthematic  class is supposed to be excited by some external causes which we call  Contagion  and which  hypothetically  he proposes as being  animalcula  From the incessant attrition of the  cortical  or vascular system it requires perpe∣tual reparation this is to be effected by an  appro∣priate  diet From an  impropriate  diet or regi∣men spring the diseases of this part of the system originally and more particularly these are to be remedied by  sapid  medicines as those of the  medul∣lary  system are by  olids  Hence arises the author's general division of all medicines as discoverable by their sensible qualities to the  taste  and  smelling  The  Sapids  according to this theory acting pecu∣liarly on the cortical part as the  Olids  do immedi∣ately on the  medullary  or nervous system In or∣der however to obtain a more complete idea of the effects of each of these general classes of medicines each must be viewed in its most simple state by which  Sapids  will appear to be rather what we call  Nutritives  and  Olids  more strictly speaking  Me∣dicines  A table of of the several  qualities  of medi∣cines acording to these two general divisions closes the  Genera Morborum  In LINNAEUS published a small piece un∣der the title of CLAVIS MEDICINAE  duplex exterior et interior  Holm vo pp This small tract may be considered as a syllabus of his lectures It is an enlarged view of the theory just mentioned connecting it with general  Pathology  and the the∣rapeutic part of physic In the latter part all simples are arranged in thirty  orders  according to their sensible qualities agreeably to the theory which is displayed more at large in two papers printed in the  Amoenitates Academicae  under the titles of  Sapores et Odores Medicamentorum  It appears from several parts of the writings of LINNAEUS that the  dietetic  part of physic had been an object to which he had paid much atten∣tion and he has explained himself in the follow∣ing manner relating to it  In his meae deliciae in his plura collegi quam quod novi alius ullus  but whether our author's observations on this sub∣ject may hereafter be published we are yet to learn  In was published LINNAEUS'S last work being the continuation of the  Mantissa  in which the work is carried on to pages under the title of MANTISSA ALTERA Near one half of this volume comprehends additional new  genera  and  species  and the remaining part a variety of emendations with some considerable augmentation to the animal kingdom These will greatly enrich a future edition of his works and in the preface he has earnestly intreated succeeding editors to pay a pro∣per regard to them  Besides his separate works which we have now brought to a conclusion LINNAEUS wrote a great number of papers on the subjects of physic and natural history which were published in the  Acta Literaria Upsaliensia  and in the  Stockholm Acts  The first of these works was begun by  Olaus Celsius  in and continued to the year and is in Latin in volumes quarto The lat∣ter publication is in the  Swedish  language in the octavo form and has been continued ever since the establishment of the academy at  Stockholm  in by king  Adolphus  Many of these papers are superseded by the subsequent works of our author neither would it be within our plan to give a particular detail of them we are therefore only to subjoin a catalogue of these detached pieces and regret that it is not in our power to make it more complete or to add such if there be any as may have been given by LINNAEUS to foreign academies  In the  Acta Upsaliensia  are the following papers written by LINNAEUS  Florula Lapponica  in This as is before observed was our author's first publication and consists only of a bare catalogue of the  Lapland  plants digested into the order of the  sexual system  of which it is the first specimen The second part of this list appears not till the year  Animalia Regni Sueciae  in  Orchides iisque affines  in This catalogue is accompanied by a copious collection of syno∣nyms to each species  Genera

Kalendars  by which means useful intelligence finds its way into the most remote and obscure recesses of every king∣dom in  Euporista in Dysenteria  in  Pini usus oeconomicus  in  Abietis usus oeconomicus  in  The manifold uses of these trees some of which were not sufficiently known in divers parts of the kingdom of  Sweden  induced our author to throw together all that his extensive journeys had enabled him to collect thereon in these two papers  Sexus Plantarum  in  Sexus Plantarum usus oeconomicus  in The practical use of this paper is more particularly an object of all who have the care of gardens to  whom the sex of plants is no longer a matter of mere speculation  Theae Potus  in  Scabiosae novae Speciei Descriptio  in after∣wards called by our author in his  Species

illa licet solvetur in aequore navis  Quae nunquam liquidis sicca carebit aquis  We know not of any other publication of LINNAEUS'S after the  Mantissa altera  in and indeed the preface to that work is sufficient to preclude the expectation of any new performance if his advanced age had not of itself rendered it sufficiently improbable after that period  In the spring of the year Dr  Murray  Professor of Physic and Botany at  Gottingen  a  Swede  by birth who had been educated under LINNAEUS and had long enjoyed a great share of his confidence and esteem paid his Preceptor a visit he found his faculties unimpaired and his ardor for the improvement of science as strong and vigorous as ever He speaks with great de∣light of the satisfaction he received from his com∣pany and in the contemplation and inspection of his museum at  Hammarby  but regretted much to find that LINNAEUS had no farther thoughts of publishing a new edition of his  System of Nature  purposing only to give a supplement However before Dr  Murray  left  Upsal  he prevailed on him to promise that he would transmit to him his ad∣ditional observations to the  Systema Vegetabilium  in order to enable him to give a complete edition of that work This the Professor did and Dr  Murray  performed it in the year very much to the satisfaction of all who pursue the LINNAEAN method The manuscript additions communica∣ted on this occasion by our author together with those collected from the several  Addenda  and from the  Mantissae  enabled Dr  Murray  to extend this volume to above one hundred pages beyond that of the th edition published in  It appears that LINNAEUS upon the whole en∣joyed a good constitution At times however he had been severely afflicted with an  hemicrania  and had not been exempted from the gout How much he suffered from this latter distemper we  have before mentioned when treating on the  Phi∣losophia Botanica  And notwithstanding the sound state in which Dr  Murray  left him we find that very soon after his memory became somewhat impaired The consciousness of this defect was said to have induced him to decline all thoughts of further publications and to transmit to Dr  Mur∣ray  such materials as were in readiness to compleat future editions of his  System  In the summer of it was known here that his strength was declining apace and his infirmi∣ties in general much increased he being unable to take his usual walks in his garden without assistance At the latter end of the year he was seized with an  apoplexy  which left him paralytic and at the be∣ginning of the year he suffered another stroke which very much impaired his mental powers These attacks at his advanced stage of life shew∣ed that dissolution was not far off But the dis∣ease which was said to have been the more imme∣diate cause of his death was an ulceration of the urinary bladder Nevertheless he languished through the year and died on the th of  January  aged years and months  To the lovers of science it will not appear strange nor will it be unpleasant to hear that uncommon respect was shewn to the memory of this great man We are told that  on his death a general mourning took place at  Upsal  and that his funeral procession was attended by the whole university as well professors as stu∣dents and the pall supported by sixteen doctors  of physic all of whom had been his pupils  The King of  Sweden  after the death of LINNAEUS or∣dered a medal to be struck of which  one side exhibits LINNAEUS'S bust and name and the other  Cybele  in a dejected attitude holding in her left hand a key and surrounded with ani∣mals and growing plants with this legend  Deam luctus angit amissi  and beneath  post obitum Upsaliae die x Jan  MDCCLXXVIII  Rege jubente  The same generous monarch not only honoured the Royal Academy of Sciences with his presence when LINNAEUS'S commemora∣tion was held at  Stockholm  but as a still higher tribute in his speech from the throne to the assembly of the states lamented  Sweden  's loss by his death Nor was he honoured only in his own country The present learned and worthy professor of botany at  Edinburgh  not only pro∣nounced an eulogium in honour of LINNAEUS before his students at the opening of his lectures in the spring of but laid also the foundationstone of a monument to be raised to his memory which while it perpetuates the name and merits of LINNAEUS will do honour to the founder and it may be hoped prove the means of raising an emulation favourable to that science which this illustrious  Swede  so highly dignified and improved This monument consists of a vase supported on a pedestal with this inscription  LINNAEO POSUIT J HOPE  The high reputation which this great man has long held among the naturalists throughout the world might readily perhaps preclude any encomium from our pen since to all lovers of  natural  sci∣ence his  name  itself is eulogy and will doubtless very long be inseparable from the idea of his ex∣traordinary merit Might we nevertheless be indulged so far we hope the following brief esti∣mate of his talents will be thought just and easily deduced from an impartial view of his writings  Nature had in an eminent manner been liberal in the endowments of his mind He seems to have been possessed of a lively imagination corrected however by a strong judgment and guided by the laws of system Add to these the most retentive memory an unremitting industry and the greatest perseverance in all his pursuits as is evident from that continued vigour with which he prosecuted the design that he appears to have formed so early in life of totally reforming and fabricating anew the whole science of natural history and this fabric he raised and gave to it a degree of perfection unknown before and had moreover the un∣common felicity of living to see his own struc∣ture rise above all others notwithstanding every discouragement its author at first laboured under and the opposition it afterwards met with Neither has any writer more cautiously avoided that com∣mon error of building his own fame on the ruin of another man's He every where acknowledged the several merits of each author's system and no man appears to have been more sensible of the  par∣tial  defects  of his own Those anomalies which had principally been the objects of criticism he well knew every  artificial  arrangement must abound with and having laid it down as a firm maxim that every system must finally rest on its in∣trinsic merit he willingly commits his own to the judgment of posterity Perhaps there is no cir∣cumstance of LINNAEUS'S life which shews him in a more dignified light than his conduct to∣wards his opponents Disavowing controversy and justly considering it as an unimportant and fruitless sacrifice of time he never replied to any numerous as they were at one season  To all who see the aid this extraordinary man has brought to  natural science  his talents must appear in a very illustrious point of view but more especially to those who from similarity of taste are qualified to see more distinctly the vast extent of his original design the greatness of his labour and the elaborate execution he has given to the whole He had a happy command of the Latin tongue which is alone the language of science and no man ever applied it more successfully to his purposes or gave to description such copi∣ousness united with that precision and conciseness which so eminently characterize his writings  In the mean time we are not to learn that it has been objected as derogatory to his learning in no small degree that he has introduced a num∣ber of terms not authorized by classical authority But granting this it ought to be recollected that LINNAEUS in the investigation of nature has  discovered a multitude of relations which were entirely unknown to the antients if therefore there be any force in the objection it should first be shewn that the terms which he has introduced to express these relations are not fairly and analo∣gically deduced from the language since it must surely be granted that LINNAEUS could not have spoken the language of  natural history  as it is known at this day in that of  Pliny  or of any clas∣sical writer whatever  The ardor of LINNAEUS'S inclinations to the study of nature from his earliest years and that uncommon application which he bestowed upon it gave him a most comprehensive view both of its pleasures and usefulness at the same time that it opened to him a wide field hitherto but little cultivated especially in his own country Hence he was early led to regret that the study of natural history as a public institution had not made its way into the universities in many of which logical dis∣putations and metaphysical theories had too long prevailed to the exclusion of more useful sci∣ence Availing himself therefore of the advan∣tages which he derived from a large share of elo∣quence and an animated style he never failed to display in a lively and convincing manner the relation this study hath to the public good to incite the great to countenance and protect it to encourage and allure youth into its pursuits by opening its manifold sources of pleasure to their view and shewing them how greatly this agreeable employment would add in a variety of instances  both to their comfort and emolument His ex∣tensive view of natural history as connected with almost all the arts of life did not allow him to confine these motives and incitements to those only who were designed for the practice of physic He also laboured to inspire the great and opulent with a taste for this study and wished particularly that such as were devoted to an ecclesiastic life should share a portion of natural science not only as a means of sweetening their rural situ∣ation confined as many are perpetually to a country residence but as what would almost in∣evitably lead in a variety of instances to disco∣veries which only such situations could give rise to and which the learned in great cities could have no opportunities to make Not to add that the mutual communication and enlargement of this kind of knowledge among people of equal rank in a country situation must prove one of the strongest bonds of union and friendship and con∣tribute in a much higher degree than the usual perishing amusements of the age to the pleasures and advantages of society  LINNAEUS lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labour in an uncommon degree Natural his∣tory raised itself in  Sweden  under his culture to a state of perfection unknown elsewhere and was from thence disseminated through all  Europe  His pupils dispersed themselves all over the globe and with their master's fame ex∣tended both science and their own More than this he lived to see the sovereigns of  Europe  establish several public institutions in favour of this study and even professorships established in divers universities for the same purpose which do honour to their founders and patrons and which have excited a curiosity for the science and a sense of its worth that cannot fail to further its progress and in time raise it to that rank which it is entitled to hold among the pursuits of man∣kind  Were it in our power minutely to describe the person of our author in conformity to the custom of biographers it would be a matter of small mo∣ment as the endowments of his mind and his great talents have so superior a claim to atten∣tion In the commemorationspeech delivered by his friend Dr  Baeck  physician to the king of  Sweden  LINNAEUS'S stature is described as being  diminutive his head large his look ardent piercing and apt to daunt the beholder His ear not sensible to music his temper quick his memory good though in the latter period of his life liable to fail him some∣times his knowledge of languages confined yet no interesting discovery escaped him In summer he used to sleep from ten to three o'clock in winter from nine to six and instantly to cease from his labours when he found him∣self not well disposed for them He was an agreeable companion of quick sensibility but easily appeased  Those who would be gra∣tified by forming an idea of his person may be acquainted that there are extant three half∣length  prints of LINNAEUS in his works Two of these are in octavo and the other in a half∣sheet or rather large quarto The first was pre∣fixed to the  Leipsic  edition of the  Systema Naturae  printed in and represents LINNAEUS as we apprehend in about the fortieth year of his age another to the second edition of the  Species Plan∣tarum  in and the larger one to the sixth edition of the  Genera Plantarum  in In the first and the last of these which are by much the better engravings he is figured in an undress resting upon a volume of the  Systema  and holding in his hand a sprig of the LINNAEA a plant so called by Dr  Gronovius  in honour of his name In that of he is represented in a full dress with the  insignia  of the  Order of the Polar Star  at his breast and  Aurivillius  's inscription under∣neath  "Hic ille est cui regna volens natura reclusit  "Quamque ulli dederat plura videnda dedit"  The Academy of Sciences at  Stockholm  have at their own expence directed that an engraving of his portrait should be made at  Paris  from an ori∣ginal picture by the famous  Swedish  painter  Roslin  There is a striking likeness also exhibited on a large medallion  a'l'antique  of almost two feet in dia∣meter by M  L'Archeveque  In  England  we have an elegant small medallion fabricated by those excellent artists Mess  Wedgwood  and  Bently  It represents LINNAEUS in profile when far advanced in years The bust is white upon a lightblue  ground and the  Linnaea  placed at the breast This is said by all who knew the professor to bear the greatest likeness We regret that it is not in our power to describe the medals which were struck in honour of LINNAEUS by order of several noblemen of the first distinction in  Sweden  parti∣cularly that by Count  Tessin  's direction since that nobleman was among the first who discerned and patronized the merit of our author and ever bore to it the most public and honourable testimony This LINNAEUS hath acknowledged in the warmest effusions of gratitude  It hath been observed before that the professor married the daughter of Dr  More  the provincial physician of  Dalekarlia  soon after he settled at  Stockholm  in This lady survived him and he has left a son named  Charles  and four daughters The younger  Linnaeus  was demonstra∣tor in the botanical garden at  Upsal  so early as the year having in that and the succeeding year published two  Decads of rare Plants  lately raised there accompanied with the figures Not long after he was constituted joint professor in the botanical chair with his father and of late years entirely occupied that department Since the death of his father we learn that he has obtained some of his employments particularly the professorship of the theory of physic and has resigned that of botany in favour of Dr  Thunberg  It has been said that he intends to publish a MANTISSA TERTIA which his father left nearly finished also several collections of plants which had been sent to LIN∣NAEUS  not long before his death from the  Cape of Good Hope  and from several other parts of the world  Elizabeth Christina  one of the daughters of our author made herself known to the learned world in by a discovery which was published in the  Swedish Acts  of the same year It re∣lated to a curious and before quite unobserved appearance in the flowers of the  Indian Cresses  Tropaeolum majus which she had perceived to emit spontaneously at certain intervals sparks like those of electricity or rather such as arise from a fulminating powder This was only visible in the dusk of the evenings and ceased when total darkness came on She had shewn this singular appearance to her father and other philosophers particularly to Mr  Wilcke  a celebrated electrician who was inclined to believe that it was an electri∣cal phenomenon  A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE  THE collection known under this title con∣sists of seven volumes in vo and contains theses It is supposed the first volume was not originally collected by LINNAEUS himself but he at least reprinted it very early and that he might not be defrauded of the advantage of these publications became the editor of all the succeeding volumes Something has been said relating to this collection in the course of these memoirs to which we have only to add that we beg the reader to regard the following pages as little more than an enlarged table of contents intended only to excite a due at∣tention to this part of LINNAEUS'S works which the compiler presumes to be less known than it deserves and at the same time to entreat him to consider that it is impossible by means of any abridgment to give an adequate idea of that merit and excellent arrangement of the subjects in these volumes which cannot but render them an agreeable and useful miscellany and ornament to the library of every naturalist philosopher and physician  AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE VOL I Holm pp  BETULA NANA  L M Klase    In this dissertation is exhibited a complete his∣tory accompanied with a figure of the  Betula  nana  foliis orbiculatis crenatis  Spec Plant pp or the  Dwarf Birch  which cloaths the  Lap∣land  alps in great quantities and is of signal use in the oeconomy of the inhabitants of that arctic region The branches furnish them with their chief fuel and the seeds are the food of the ptar∣migans or white partridge  Tetrao Lagopus  Syst These birds being much esteemed make a considerable part of the sustenance of the inhabitants great quantities are caught in the winter season and sent to different provinces Before LINNAEUS made his  Lapland  expedition this  Birch  had been considered as a  variety  only of the common tree of that name but its distinct specific characters have since been established This tree has within these few years been added to the  Flora Britannica  having been found in the highlands of  Scotland  HISTORIA  naturalis et medica  FICUS  C He∣gardt    From the earliest times the cultivation of the figtree has been an important object in all the oriental countries In this dissertation we are presented with a history of this  genus  of which  the writer has enumerated species LINNAEUS has however greatly reduced this number in his  Species Plantarum  since many are varieties effected by culture That part of the history of this tree which for many ages was so enigmatical and which nothing but the doctrine of the sexes of plants has completely cleared up namely the husbandry or  caprification  as it is called is more particularly worthy of attention not only as a singular pheno∣menon in itself but as it has furnished one of the most convincing proofs of the reality of the sexes of plants Our limits will not allow us to detail this subject in brief it is thisIt is now known that the flowers of the figtree are situated within a pulpy receptacle which we call the  Fig  or fruit of this tree of these receptacles in the wild figtree some have male flowers only and others have male and female both distinct though placed in the same receptacle In the garden or  cultivated  fig these are found to contain only fe∣male flowers which are fecundated by means of a kind of gnat  Cynips Psenes  Syst Nat bred in the fruit of the  wild  figtrees which pierces that of the  cultivated  in order to deposit its eggs within at the same time diffusing within the re∣ceptacle the  farina  of the male flowers Without this operation the fruit may ripen but no  effective  seeds are produced hence the  garden  fig can only be propagated by layers and cuttings in these countries where the  wild  fig is not known The process of thus ripening the fruit in the oriental countries is not left to nature but is managed  with great art and different degrees of dexterity so as to reward the skilful husbandman with a much larger increase of fruit than would other∣wise be produced A tree of the same size which in  Provence  where caprification is not practised may produce about pounds of fruit will by that art in the  Grecian  islands bring ten times that quantity  DISSERTATIO  de  PELORIA  D Rudberg    A description with the figure of a very ex∣traordinary variety of the common yellow  Toad Flax Antirrhinum Linaria  Sp Pl which was found in several parts of  Sweden  and since in  Germany  and engaged the attention of the bota∣nists very greatly at the time Indeed its variation is uncommonly singular The flower instead of the ringent tetrandrous flower of the  Linaria  with a single corniculated  Nectarium  was found with a regular monopetalous pentandrous tube from the base of which proceeded five  Nectaria  yet uncommon as this proved LINNAEUS discovered it to be no other than a monster or  hybrid  plant sprung from the  Linaria  though it does not ap∣pear to this day that its origin on the other side has been sufficiently ascertained The habit of the plant and its sensible quality agree with those of the  Linaria    De  CORALLIIS BALTICIS  H Fougt    In this tract the author after having traced the history of  Corals  from the remotest period of natural  history and considered the several theories that have at different times prevailed relating to the production of these bodies acquiesces in the  modern one  which ascribes their formation to  Polypes  and which the late Mr  Ellis  and seve∣ral other writers have much confirmed and illus∣trated He then gives a copious description of twenty species all found in the  Baltic  of which an excellent engraving is subjoined These bodies are found in immense masses in some parts of this sea on the coast of  Gothland  there are strata of corals extending through tracts of several miles  AMPHIBIA GYLLENBORGIANA  B R Hast    A detailed description of species of animals all of the  Amphibia  class which were presented by Count  Gyllenborg  to the university of  Upsal  of which he was at that time chancellor and to which he had been a munificent patron having inte∣rested himself in procuring to be built and fur∣nished an astronomical observatory in restoring to a state of usefulness the botanic garden which had been in ruins for many years in causing stoves to be erected and a house built for the demonstrator and finally in having presented to the university his own  museum  collected at a great expence and consisting of rare  amphibia  insects corals minerals and moreover of many elegant works of art  In this tract is exhibited the first specimen of LINNAEUS'S method of zoological description at  large as also the first attempt to form the spe∣cific character of the  Serpentes  ORDER from the  different number of the rings and scales of the body and tail taken conjointly  Former authors generally had recourse to colour alone in distinguishing these animals which was found at length to be too unstable and had given rise to a most enormous multiplication of the species This mode of distinction has been since adopted by others and is retained in the  Systema Naturae  PLANTAE MARTINOBURSERIANAE  R Martin    J Burser  a most diligent disciple and friend of  Caspar Bauhine  and afterwards professor of phy∣sic at  Sora  in the kingdom of  Naples  who had travelled almost all over  Europe  and had particu∣larly sought for rare plants in the Alps had col∣lected in these journeys an  Hortus Siccus  contained in volumes which after various fates was given by M  Coijet  to the university of  Upsal  The purport of this tract is to illustrate the most rare plants contained in this collection and such particularly as were obscurely known to the collec∣tor and to add to these the specific names ac∣cording to the principles of the  Linnaean  method with this view species are here enumerated  HORTUS UPSALIENSIS  S Naucler    Botanical gardens began to be founded in  Eu∣rope  so early as the middle of the sixteenth century  the first was that of  Padua  in The gar∣den of  Upsal  was founded in by  Charles Gustavus  under the direction of the elder  Rudbeck  How much this garden owes to LINNAEUS we have already said in the account of the catalogue of plants published by himself in This history of the antient and modern state of the garden given by  Naucler  contains a variety of curi∣ous matter on the subject and is illustrated with a groundplot and view of the garden lists of the succulent plants and others and what is more particularly acceptable the lives of the  Rudbecks  father and son whose literary fame is founded not on botany alone but on anatomy and the knowledge of antiquities  De PASSIFLORA  J G Hallman    A very methodical history of that beautiful and muchadmired genus of plants which the Catho∣lics who first saw it in  America  and from the fancied resemblance of the cross which they per∣ceived in the flower called  Passion Flower  and which soon held a distinguished rank in the  Euro∣pean  gardens M  Hallman  after a chronological list of those writers who first exhibited the several species from  Peter Ciltza  and  Monardes  down to  Dillenius  describes at large species and gives their several synonyms adding afterwards a list of many which are dubious He subjoins the uses which the natives of  America  make of these plants principally borrowed from  Piso  The whole is  ornamented and rendered much more useful by a plate on which are engraven different views of the flower and a figure of the leaf of each species  The  Passion Flower  belongs to the  gynandrous  plants with five stamina and the number of species as they now stand in the system is aug∣mented to without mentioning two others de∣scribed and figured as new by M  Jacquin  who brought them from  Carthagena  All the  Passion Flowers  yet known are natives of the warmer parts of  America  only and not found in any other parts of the globe  De ANANDRIA  E Z Tursen    The history of a singular  Siberian  plant which during the time of flowering was found not to open the  calix  and was called  Anandria  by pro∣fessor  Siegesbeck  of  Petersburgh  who had  fancied  that it was destitute of  stamina  and having de∣clared himself a strenuous opposer of the  sexual  system thought by the instance of this plant to have overturned the whole doctrine of the sexes of plants having written a treatise in which he had asserted that the  stamina  did not constitute the  essential  parts of the plant and that the seed would become fertile without the influence of the  Pollen Antherarum  This plant is  syngenesious  and of that genus which we name  Coltsfoot  It stands in the System under the name of  Tussilago Anandria scapo unifloro subsquamoso erecto foliis lyratoovatis  and subsequent observations proved that in a  warmer situation  than its native one the  calix  would open and shew a radiated flower The contro∣versy which was managed in behalf of LINNAEUS by Dr  Gleditsch  of  Berlin  much extended the knowledge and favoured the establishment of the  Linnaean  system at that time unwillingly received by many of the older botanists  De ACROSTICO  J B Heiligtag    A botanical dissertation on a genus of plants belonging to an extensive  natural  order placed in the  Cryptogamia  class which we call  Ferns  and which were known to former botanists by the name of  Epiphyllospermous  plants since they chiefly pro∣duce their parts of fructification on the back of the leaf or  frons  After some general observations on the plants constituting this order which have also been called  Capillary  plants and shewing the place they hold and their  characters  in the several systems of  Ray Morison Tournefort  and LINNAEUS the writer proceeds to an ample description of the species of  Acrostica  of which he enumerates seven∣teen with their synonyms This genus is distin∣guished by having the fructification spread all over the surface of the leaf and the number of species in the last edition of the System is augmented to thirty They are mostly of  American  produce three only being  European  of which two are spar∣ingly found in  Britain  They are a singular set of plants and have much excited the attention of botanists A plate accompanies this tract on which five of the uncommon species are delineated  MUSEUM ADOLPHO FREDERICIANUM  L Balk    The subject of this paper is strictly zoological It contains a particular description of of the rarer kinds of animals which were presented to the  museum  of the university by the late King  Adolphus  of  Sweden  at that time hereditary prince These descriptions being drawn up with sufficient accu∣racy and regard to the rules of the  Linnaean  sys∣tem and referred to in the subsequent zoology of LINNAEUS yet retain their value  Amphibia  and Fishes form the greater part of this collection among the former we mention particularly an ex∣cellent description of the Chameleon  Lacerta Chamaeleon  Syst of the  Amphisboena Fuliginosa  Syst of the  Crotalus Horridus  or Rattle Snake and among the latter of the  Torpedo  which has so lately excited anew the attention of electricians as also of that remarkable fish called  Soldigo  by the  Portuguese Silurus Callichthys  Syst which  Marcgrave  and  Piso  say will travel in dry seasons across the land from rivulet to rivulet in quest of water Two copperplates accompany this tract  SPONSALIA PLANTARUM  J G Wahlbom    Whoever would see all the arguments for and the result of those experiments on which the doc∣trine of the sexes of plants is founded are refer∣red to this dissertation as containing by fat the most clear comprehensive and yet copious view  of that subject It is professedly a commentary upon the th chapter of LINNAEUS'S  Fundamenta  or  Philosophia Botanica  from section to inclusive and contains pages It is out of our plan to produce any detail of these arguments suffice it to say that although from the writings of  Theophrastus  and  Pliny  we learn that the antients had some idea of an analogy in this respect between the animal and vegetable kingdom drawn perhaps principally from the artificial mode of foecundating the  datetree  yet so crude and erroneous were their ideas that in many instances they called those plants male or female which modern discoveries have taught us are exactly the reverse Indeed it does not appear that any very precise ideas on this subject were established till late in the last century and were it a matter of importance to determine  to whom  applause is due for this discovery the  English  might perhaps with justice claim this honour and bestow it on Sir  Tho∣mas Millington  Savilian professor who appears to have been the first that gave the hint to Dr  Grew  since whose time this doctrine has received so much light that we presume few people can now doubt the following position which briefly con∣tains the whole of what is understood now by this analogy namely  That the influence of the  farina  from the  antherae  of flowers upon the  stigma  is essentially necessary to give fertility to the seed  If there are any who yet wish to see what arguments may be adduced  against this  doc∣trine they are referred to the  Anthologia  of  Ponte∣dera  and to the late Dr  Alston  's Dissertation on Botany It hath been before observed that LIN∣NAEUS was honoured with a premium from the Royal Academy of Sciences at  Petersburgh  for his excellent Treatise on the  Sponsalia Plantarum  in which he is thought to have most irrefragably proved his position  NOVA PLANTARUM GENERA  C M Dassow    In this paper are described and established the natural characters of new  genera  all which were afterwards taken into the th edition of the  Genera Plantarum  of LINNAEUS published in  VIRES PLANTARUM  F Hasselquist    Practical physicians have wished and some have formed the idea that it is possible to deduce the virtues of plants from their agreement in similar characters of fructification in habit or agreement in  natural orders  or classes Mr  Petiver  long since was among the first that hazarded some re∣flexions on this subject see Philosophical Trans∣actions N  o  and  Lowthorp  's Abridgment vol ii p And the very eminent Dr HOFFMANN has a professed dissertation on it in the fifth volume of his works p It is the intention of the present paper written by this in∣genious but unfortunate disciple of LINNAEUS to extend and illustrate the same idea by this com∣mentary on the th chapter of the  Philosophia Botanica  which contains the general doctrine of  this attempt and an enumeration of those  natural  or  artificial  orders in botany which are supposed to illustrate and confirm the possibility of attain∣ing this desirable end To mention a few in∣stances of this agreement in character and qualities The stellated class in  Ray  's system are mostly  diuretics  the  asperifoliae  are chiefly  demulcents  the  umbelliferous  plants which grow in dry places are  aromatics  particularly the roots and seeds but if growing in wet situations usually partake more or less of a deleterious quality The  Icosan∣drous  plants of LINNAEUS abound with  pulpy  and  esculent  fruits the  Polyandrous  are many of them poisonous the  Syngenesious  in frequent instances intense  bitters  c It most not be concealed how∣ever that there are not wanting those who consider both the  natural method  in botany and the deduc∣tion of the virtues of simples from  these congruities  as the  philosopher's stone  of the science notwith∣standing which there is no attempt in the im∣provement of botany or its true application to the uses of physic which ought more strenuously and unremittingly to be pursued than that of bringing to all possible perfection the purpose of this dissertation  De CHRYSTALLORUM GENERATIONE  M Kahler    In this tract is discussed at large that opinion which LINNAEUS early imbibed and which led him to ascribe to the operation of one and the  same principle the regular polyedrous figure of all those bodies called  Chrystals  acting upon them during their suspension in an aqueous menstruum and this he conceived to be equally the case whether these bodies are what we usually call  sa∣line  or whether they are  lapidose pyriticose  or  arsenical  or finally whether they are such as are termed  metallic  salts Hence arose his arrange∣ment of figured  Spars Selenite quartzose Chrystals  including all the  gems  under that  genus  of salt to which their agreement in figure entitled them to a place This opinion gave so much offence to mi∣neralogists that most probably it rendered his  System  in the mineral kingdom much less accept∣able than the other parts of that work had been In this paper  lapidose  chrystals only are considered many of which are figured and described and referred to the several salts with which they agree in figure LINNAEUS'S idea on this subject has been lately taken up and pursued in a very ex∣tensive manner by M  de Romé de Lisle  in an Essay printed at  Paris  in It must be con∣fessed however that the greatest difficulties attend the solution of this matter how far the further consideration of the  volcanic  system which is gain∣ing ground in the minds of some philosophers and mineralogists may elucidate the origin of certain figured bodies which are said to have a  chrystal∣line  or vitreous basis time only must shew hi∣therto it seems to bid fairer towards solving some difficulties than any foregoing hypothesis  SURINAMENSIA GRILLIANA  P Sund    The description at large of subjects of the animal kingdom chiefly  Serpentes  collected at  Suri∣nam  by Mr  Gerret  famous for being among the first who introduced and successfully cultivated coffee in  America  and who sent these curiosities to M  Grill  an opulent citizen of  Stockholm  by which means they came finally into the museum of  Upsal  We here meet with an excellent account of the  Rattlesnake  and particularly a description and figure of the  Boa Constrictor  that gigantic serpent of which we have such copious and astonishing ac∣counts in  Adanson Piso Kaempfer  and others The plate also presents a figure of the  Coecilia Tentaculata  Syst of the  Coluber Ammodytes  Syst and of the  Egyptian  Locust  Gryllus Cristatus  Syst all which are amply described  FLORA OECONOMICA  E Aspelin    There is scarcely any morsel in this collection more worthy of regard or that has a more use∣ful tendency than this paper which is in∣tended to display and really contains in a com∣pendious way the uses of the indigenous plants of  Sweden  whether in  Agriculture rural Oeconomy in general  in the  Arts  or in  culinary uses  It does not profess to deliver their medicinal qualities that not being a part of the plan The plants are enumerated in the order in which they are found in the  Flora Suecica  but no botanical distinctions or disquisitions are here introduced We have  no work on this plan  extant in  England  and are per∣suaded  that something of this kind on a more extended scale written in the language of the country and adapted to common use could not fail to meet with a favourable reception and would certainly be highly beneficial not only by disclosing matter of real and instant information to many who are ignorant of the various appli∣cations that have already been made of plants which are daily neglected but by exciting a spirit of investigation in general would doubtless lead to new discoveries An  economical Flora  or  Herbal  is what we have never yet seen our works that bear the name of  Herbals  treat on plants and trees as if their utility was alone confined to the pur∣poses of physic and even here in a variety of instances attribute to them virtues which neither their sensible qualities have justified nor experi∣ence has ascertained  We have observed that this work is confined to the native plants of the country out of which as an instance of the variety of subjects that are here mentioned as objects of economy in various ways there are not less than three hundred that have a place in this catalogue    De  CURIOSITATE NATURALI  O Soderberg    This concluding paper of the first volume is a discourse intended as an incitement to the study of natural history by a train of wellconnected arguments and observations drawn from that ad∣mirable display of wisdom and goodness manifest  throughout all nature and from its dignity and importance as so immediately connected with uti∣lity to mankind from all which considerations the author thinks it entitled to one of the most distinguished ranks among the objects of human enquiry and that so far from being a frivolous pursuit it is in every view one of the worthiest employments of the human mind  AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE VOL II pp  OECONOMIA NATURAE  J J Biberg    It is impossible in an abstract to do any proper justice to this excellent production the design of which is entirely physicotheological and conse∣quently its scope is various and extensive The writer first considers in general the  Structure of the Earth  its seas mountains c and the effects of the change of seasons on all parts of its surface and on the elements the disposition of the  Fossil Kingdom  and the various origin of its several bo∣dies with their gradual transmutation from whence in many instances arise their different denominations with us in the  Vegetable Kingdom  the various means by which the dissemination of seeds is effected thereby cloathing in every climate the whole surface of the earth and conducing to the preservation of animals in the  Animal King∣dom  itself the extraordinary increase of some the paucity of others their means of preservation  and their use even in their destruction▪ to the general economy of nature all these positions he has illustrated and confirmed by apt examples and finally draws this conclusionthat all nature is most harmoniously arranged and adapted to produce upon the whole reciprocal good This paper is among those translated by Mr  Stillingfleet    De  TAENIA  G Dubois    At the time this treatise was written the sub∣ject had more than usually engaged the attention of the  Swedish  naturalists and physicians and par∣ticularly of LINNAEUS and his colleague Dr  Rosen  the family of the latter having suffered much from this dangerous animal as appears by his treatise  on the Diseases of Children  lately ren∣dered into  English  by Dr  Sparmann  The author has here described and figured four species all of which are found in the intestines of animals chiefly in those of carnivorous quadru∣peds and unhappily two of these kinds but more particularly the  T Solium  too frequently infest the human body The specific differences of the  Taeniae  arise from the  number and situation  of the mouths or suckers in each link of this com∣pound animal the history of which has employed the pens of many ingenious men and is notwith∣standing yet involved in considerable obscurity  The Tapeworms most commonly infesting the human body are those described by LINNAEUS under the names of  Taenia Solium  and  Taenia Vul∣garis  Syst Nat p both of which are not  unfrequently found extended from the  duodenum  almost through the whole tract of the intestines Much controversy has been spent in determining whether these animals have any part that is analo∣gous to the brain or head in other animals our author affirms the contrary considering them as  compound animals  consisting as it were of a chain every link of which is a perfect animal furnished with a mouth and all its proper organs and ca∣pable when separated from its original chain of propagating its species as if by a vegetative power and independent of any  oviparous  or  vivi∣parous  process In this idea he is opposed by Dr  Tyson  who has figured the head of the  Taenia Solium  in the Philosophical Transactions see N  o  and  Lowthrop  's Abridgment Vol iii p as also by  Pallas  in his  Elenchus Zoophytorum  and by some other authors The  Vermes Cucurbitini  or gourd∣worms of foregoing writers are now however allow∣ed to be the descending or posterior links of the  Taenia Solium  and these according to LINNAEUS are again capable of extending themselves and pro∣ducing another chain According to  Pallas  and others these joints are pregnant with  ova  In either case the reason is at once seen why these noxious creatures are with such difficulty expelled from the human body LINNAEUS however does not deny that they are capable of propagation by  ova  too and says they are found though much smaller in muddy springs to which  Pallas  with difficulty assents LINNAEUS'S opinion however is confirmed by subsequent observations and in∣deed  we cannot but observe that without allow∣ing them to exist elsewhere than in the intestines of animals it is exceedingly difficult to account for the  locality  of the disease arising from these worms  We cannot enlarge on this treatise consistent with our plan it must be sufficient to observe that this dissertation besides being in itself highly satisfactory may be considered as an  index  also to those writers that are most worthy of being con∣sulted on the same subject  LIGNUM COLUBRINUM  J A Darelius    This is a critical enquiry to determine the spe∣cies of that drug called  Lignum Colubrinum  which it is said the  Indian Ichneumon Weesel  or  Mungos Viverra Ichneumon  β Lin Syst first point∣ed out to the  Indians  This wood the  Zeylanese  use as an antidote to the poison of the Hooded Serpent or  Naja  called also  Cobra de Capello Coluber Naja  Syst of which  Kaempfer  has given so extensive an history as the most poison∣ous of all serpents  Darelius  prefixes to his en∣quiry the history of both these animals of which too many marvellous things have been related he then examines into the pretensions of that drug which had usually been sold in  Europe  under the name of  Lignum Colubrinum  see  Dale's Pharmaco∣log  p which is the  Strychnos Colubrina  Spec Plant and rejects its claim inclining at length to bestow it on the plant described by  Kaempfer  under the name of  Radix Mungo  p This plant was received into the System among  the  Pentandrous  tribe under the name of  Ophior∣rhiza Mungos  and is figured in the  Materia Me∣dica  of our author The root is exhibited in  India  and in  Zeylon  not only as an antidote against the venom of this serpent but against the bite of the mad dog as also in putrid fevers  Grimmius  who lived long as a physician at  Columbo  in  Zey∣lon  professes to have made great use of it Our author subjoins several preparations from this  simple  and from  Lockner  presents us with the  formula  of the famous  Lapis de Goa  in which the  Mungos  root stands as the first ingredient He con∣cludes with an enquiry into the effects of the spu∣rious drug of this name the result of which suffici∣ently agrees with what is related of the  Nux Vomica  to which genus it is referred according to the sexual system  RADIX SENEGA  J Kiernander    As the terror of the  Naja  is dispelled in  Asia  by the  Ophiorrhiza  so is that of the  RattleSnake  in  America  by the  Senega  After premising the his∣tory of the RattleSnake  Crotalus Horridus  Syst chiefly borrowed from  Catesby  Dr  Kiernan∣der  gives a full botanical and medical history of this famous plant which for so long a time the  Indians  concealed from the  Europeans  The au∣thor then recites ten different vegetables of which the  Europeans  during their endeavours to come at the true  RattleSnake root  tried the effects against this subtle venom Some of these are said to have been not quite unavailing at length Dr  Tennent  discovered the secret and  found the plant to be a species of  Milkwort  which stands now in LINNAEUS'S works under the name of  Polygala Senega  Spec Pl and of this genus there are not fewer than species known The description of the  Senega  is accompanied by a figure of the plant The root which is the part alone used in medicine affords an acrimony on the palate perhaps unexampled in the whole  Materia Medica  The author gives the analysis of the root enumerates its effects as a  sialagogue diu∣retic  and  expectorant  the various preparations and their use in inflammatory diseases dropsy gout rheumatism in a disease which he mentions as endemic in  Virginia  under the name of  Ma∣rasmus Virginicus  and finally as the great specific to the venom of the rattlesnake to which end the  Indians  instantly chew it swallow the juice and apply the masticated root to the puncture The root of the  Polygala vulgaris  which grows so plentifully in  England  appears from experiments to possess the qualities of the  Senega  but in a far weaker degree  GENESIS CALCULI  J O Hagstrom    Before Dr  Hagstrom  comes to the immediate consideration of the origin of the  Calculus  of the urinary bladder he premifes some observations on calcareous substances in general and enume∣rates the several kinds of calculous concretions and their situations in the animal body such are the  Calcular Urinae Salivae Pulmonum Gastricus  Fellis  and the  Calculus Podagrae  He then consi∣siders the component parts of that  Faex Chyli  or  Lixivium  the  Urine  and the changes to which it is liable in smell taste and colour by the dif∣ferent  ingesta  under which article he mentions a singular fact of a gentleman who after having laboured under an inveterate acidity at the sto∣mach for which he had taken large quantities of chalk found his urine altered so as to have entire∣ly a milky appearance In considering the im∣mediate generation of the  Calculus  he adopts the  Boerhaavian  theory and ascribes it to  chrystalliza∣tion  this leads him to consider all those circum∣stances which favour and accelerate this mode of concreting and to seek for somewhat analogous thereto in the human body as predisposing causes to this malady which he finds in  Atonia  and the use of acid and fermented liquors He finishes the theory by some curious and apt reflections on the great analogy between this disorder and the gout and their transitions  In the therapeutic part notwithstanding all that had been written relating to the power of alkaline medicines in dissolving the connecting gluten and thus promoting the decomposition of the  Cal∣culus  the author does not allow them so much merit as hath been attributed to them by many writers He is inclined to give more efficacy to bitters particularly as  Prophylactics  from the idea of their striking more immediately at the  Atonia  and adduces two examples communicated to him by the President LINNAEUS himself of the use of the  Essentia Absinthii  in this dreadful disease This disquisition concludes with an observation on a milkdiet in the stone and gout the efficacy of which he confirms by two welladapted cases which however agreeably to foregoing observations prove the necessity in the gout of adhering to the regimen when once adopted throughout life One of these affords a melancholy lesson of the danger of deserting it in the case of a  French  ge∣neral who after twenty years freedom from the disease at the age of died in consequence of a fit brought on by  one  plentiful meal of animal food  GEMMAE ARBORUM  P Loëfling    This gentleman who afterwards at the recom∣mendation of LINNAEUS obtained a pension as naturalist to the King of  Spain  and died in his service in  America  has here given us a curious and elaborate disquisition on the  Buds  of trees a part in vegetables which till this time had been less attentively examined than many others  Gems or  Buds  are small rounded parts made up of scales differently arranged situated commonly on the stem or branches of trees and containing in epitome the rudiments of either the future  flower  singly the  leaves  singly or both  flower  and  leaves  Analogous to the  flower  and  leaf∣bearing Gem  which is the most common is a  Bulb  placed at the root of many plants inasmuch as both contain a future perfect plant requiring only envelopement by the genial effect of heat These  Gems  and  Bulbs  are called by LINNAEUS  Hyberna∣cula  as inclosing the embryo during the winter and the former are almost confined to trees of the colder countries After a requisite account of the subject in general Dr  Loëfling  exhibits a classifica∣tion of the  Gems  of species of trees and shrubs founded on the different  structure  and  situation  of the various kinds In consequence of this ar∣rangement the species of any of these trees is sup∣posed to be capable of being discovered in the winter season and state of defoliation by the buds alone  PAN SUECUS  N L Hesselgren    The originality and singular good tendency and design of this paper induced the writer of this volume several years ago to throw it into a form more immediately adapted to an  English  reader by referring to  English  authors and it was then laid before the public in the Gentleman's Magazine for the year accompanied with some notes and general observations This has enabled him to annex it in a still more enlarged form to this volume  SPLACHNUM  L Montin    Mr  Montin  at the instance of LINNAEUS had made an expedition the preceding summer into  Lapland  and amongst other natural productions had brought back this curious and uncommon moss and in this paper gives a complete botanical history of its  genus  called  Splachnum  the first  species of which singular for the elegant form of the heads had been first discovered by an  English∣man  in  Nonway  and communicated to Mr  Petiver  There are three others of which a less specious kind is not uncommon on our bogs in  England  Mr  Montin  in this journey had an opportu∣nity of confirming an opinion which LINNAEUS had before conceived relating to the cause of a most excruciating  colic  to which the  Laplanders  are often subjected and which he describes very particularly in the  Flora Lapponica  p when treating of the  Angelica  which among other simples is used as a remedy Mr  Montin  thinks it clear that it arises from swallowing in their waters the  Gordius Aquaticus  a species of worm de∣scribed in the  Fauna Suecica  N  o  well known to  Gesner  and the older writers under the name of  Vitulus Aquaticus  and  Seta Aquatica  as being no thicker than a horse hair  SEMINA MUSCORUM  P J Bergius    Dr  Bergius  since professor of pharmacy and natural history at  Stockholm  has in this tract thrown considerable light on the fructification of the second order of vegetables in the  Cryptogamia  class much more however has been done since the time he wrote and it is now thought that the tribe of Mosses have separate male and female flowers the former of which usually stand on long pedicles the latter are as yet in most  genera  very obscurely investigated and LINNAEUS him∣self appears to be doubtful whether the dust which  we observe in the heads of mosses is the  Pollen Antherarum  or the seeds themselves  MATERIA MEDICA E REGNO ANIMALI  K J Sidren    This enumeration contains subjects and is executed exactly on the plan of our author's  Ma∣teria Medica e Plantis  of which we have before spoken  PLANTAE CAMSCHATCENSES RARIORES  J P Halenius    A description at large of new  Siberian  plants sent to LINNAEUS by Dr  Gmelin  who had spent almost years by the command and at the expence of the Empress of  Russia  in investigating the natural history of that kingdom Amongst these we may particularly remark that foetid plant called  Cimicifuga foetida  Syst Nat ii so offensive and even poisonous to those insects from which it receives its name A decoction of this drastic herb is used in  Siberia  as  Gmelin  informs us  Flor Sib  iv p with great success in dropsies  It is a curious remark which is suggested by our author that in journeying eastwards in  Kamtchatka  the botanist sees his nearer approach towards  North America  by the  habit  of many of the plants and hence arose a presumptive proof of the vici∣nity of the two continents before real discoveries had confirmed the truth of it The author has  given a list of several plants that are actually the same as are found in  North America  SAPOR MEDICAMENTORUM  J Rudberg    After having premised some general observa∣tions on all the antient sects of physicians and felicitated the present age on the rejection of all hypotheses and opinions not supported by expe∣riments and considered the general physiology of the human body Dr  Roberg  proceeds to his subject which may be regarded as a very instruc∣tive comment on the d  Aphorism  of the  Phi∣losophia Botanica "Sapida in fluida et solida agunt"  under which all vegetable simples are arranged into eleven classes founded on distinctions arising from their sensible qualities principally as they affect the taste as follows  Sicca  Aquosa  Viscosa  Salsa  Acida  Styptica  Dulcia  Pinguia  Amara  Acria  Nauseosa  Under each of these heads respective simples are arranged and the comment is subjoined explain∣ing the mode of their  action  and  effects  both on the  solids  and  fluids  and frequently specifying the par∣ticular diseases in which they are employed A set of apt corollaries are added and upon the whole this little tract is by no means unworthy  the attention of medical students in general and especially of those who wish to comprehend the  Linnaean  theory of physic  To this volume of the  Amoenitates  are subjoined the three orations of LINNAEUS which as they make part of his own proper works have been spoken of in the foregoing pages of this volume  AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE VOL III pp  NOVA PLANTARUM GENERA  L J Chenon    Chiefly a description of new  genera  and species of plants brought from  North America  by Dr  Kalm  who had spent three years in that country Pre∣vious to the descriptions we have a brief mention made of those who had treated upon the plants of  North America  before  Kalm  These were  Cor∣nutus  the first writer in  Banister  in  Ray  's  history    Plukenet  in  Bobart  in  Ray  in his supplement  Catesby    Gronovius  or rather  Clayton  Dr  Mitchell  Governor  Colden  By the industry of these writers botany had been augmented with new  genera  to which  Kalm  added eight As Dr  Kalm  's plants are all now received into the System any further account of this paper is super∣seded A plate is added on which are engraven seven of the rarer species  PLANTAE HYBRIDAE  J Haartman    The subject of this paper is very intersting in botanic science and being as yet somewhat pro∣blematical has exercised the pens of several inge∣nious men but of none perhaps more successfully than that of the late Dr  Gmelin  in his  Sermo aca∣demicus de novorum vegetabilium ortu  Tubing Mr  Haartman  allows the possibility of this origin or new creation of vegetables arising from the influ∣ence of the  farina  of one species upon the  pistil  of another either of the same or of a different  genus  thus producing what is called a  Hybrid  plant In∣stances of this admixture and production of  mon∣sters  in the vegetable kingdom have been fre∣quent but as in the animal kingdom they have not usually been found to perpetuate themselves by producing fertile seeds The general effect of culture and the immense number of species with which particularly many of the  African genera  abound such as the  Geranium Erica Mesembry∣anthemum  c very much favour this hypothesis A catalogue is given of species of well∣known plants supposed to have originated in this manner specifying those also from which they are suspected to have sprung and a compa∣rison is made between the several parts and habit of each with the corresponding  hybrid  offspring to shew the probability of this origin Another list of many other plants follows in which the traces are not so strongly marked Among the  English  indigenous plants thought to have thus originated  we mention the  Veronica Hybrida  or  Welch  Speed∣well which is believed to have arisen from the  Officinalis  and the  Spicata  as the  Sibthorpia Euro∣paea  is from the Golden Saxifrage and Marsh Pennywort  OBSTACULA MEDICINAE  J G Beyersten▪    An enquiry into and a brief discussion of the causes that have hitherto impeded the progress of physic An ingenious and wellconducted plan and most laudable design which all those who wish well to the art would desire to see still farther illus∣trated by some such character as would command attention and give the subject that importance which it demands Among other obstacles the writer mentionsthe force of custom in directing prescription theories founded on hypotheses neglect of nosology too little attention to reputed poisons timid prescription too small doses ig∣norance of apothecaries in botany and the Materia Medica use of compound medicines ignorance of the natural classes of plants call which positions are confirmed by suitable reflexions and examples  PLANTAE ESCULENTAE PATRIAE  J Hiorth    A list of such native plants of  Sweden  as have been or in some way or other may be objects of culinary use principally as aliments to which are added Condiments and  Succedanea  to several  of those articles of exotic luxury which the opu∣lent nations of  Europe  import from distant parts of the world It is happily not an object of importance much less of necessity to consult such a catalogue in this nation but it would be matter of pleasure and surprise to many to see the great number of ve∣getables which in a country from its situation far from fertile may supply the want of bread The subjects of this tract amount to many of which would demand a place in an  economical herbal  adapted to a much milder climate  EUPHORBIA  J Wiman    A complete botanical history of one of the most extensive  genera  of plants several of which have a place in the  Materia Medica  which in the  Lin∣naean  system stands in the  Dodecandrous  class and furnishes greater instances of anomalies in the ha∣bit of the species than perhaps is elsewhere to be met with as it contains not only the  Euphor∣bium  the  Esula  and  Cataputia  of the shops but also all the  Tithymali  or Spurges of authors Fiftythree species are described in this dissertation and their synonyms delivered together with a general account of their uses in physic In the  Species Plantarum  this genus is augmented to the number of kinds to which probably more might be added from  Burman  's  Flora Indica  At this day the  Euphorbia  are but little used inter∣nally scarcely ever their extreme acrimony and drastic powers being too unmanageable  MATERIA MEDICA E REGNO LAPIDEO  J Lindhult    Under heads Dr  Lindhult  has comprised all the simples of the  Materia Medica  from the fossil kingdom digested exactly in the method observed by LINNAEUS himself in his separate publication of the vegetable  Materia Medica  MORBI EX HYEME  S Brodd    Preceding the history of the diseases arising from winter cold in  Sweden  Dr  Brodd  gives a general account of the effects of intense cold on the ani∣mals of the country in changing their colour diminishing the size of the breed in various spe∣cies and in  Lapland  he thinks it is instanced in the human race itself the state of the atmo∣sphere the production of meteors differences observable in the particles of the snow effects of various and additional degrees of cold on the ice of lakes c extraordinary appearance of the  Aurora Borealis  prognostics of severe winters and signs of the approaching remissions of cold with other curious particulars  The diseases of the winter season in  Sweden  are more particularly such as follow  Perniones  or Kibes unusually painful and untractable for the cure among other applications mentioned is the diluted marine acid recommended by LIN∣NAEUS himself who had found it useful among the sailors when he was physician to the fleet but this cannot be used when the disease is advanced  to its ulcerated state  Paronychia  or Whitlow of various kinds very frequent and not seldom attended with dangerous consequences  Congestio Hyemalis  a species of Catarrh extremely common and the source of worse diiseases usually arising from sudden transitions from heat to cold and incautious exposure to the latter observations on this disorder from the  Iter Westrogothicum  of LINNAEUS  Coughs  universal sometimes to the entire disturbance of all public assemblies  Pleu∣risies  especially among the country people who indulge in strong liquors  Peripneumonies  parti∣cularly considered as endemic with the inhabi∣tants about the copper mines The tract con∣cludes with a compendious view of the effects of cold and the phaenomena of winter season in a set of corollaries and a mention of the hard win∣ters in  Europe  in In the latter the lowest point of the ther∣mometer at  Upsal  was of  Celsius  's equal to about below in  Fahrenheit  ODORES MEDICAMENTORUM  A Wahlin    An ingenious illustration of the doctrine which teaches that those different sensations excited in the organs of smell by different odours will lead to the explanation of the qualities inherent in such bodies and that from thence they may be classed and their general effects on the human body de∣duced After a train of general explanatory and physiological observations Mr  Wablin  introduces  Sir  Francis Bacon  's contrast between youth and old age in order more clearly to illustrate which he does in a familiar but striking manner the effects of wine and spirituous liquors in their various and progressive operation on the nervous system from their first exhilarating effect in a moderate quantity to their intoxicating and fatal issue This he makes in some measure the basis of his reason∣ing on the effects of other odorous substances which he at length arranges into seven classes    Aromatici  Cinnamon Seeds of Amomum c    Fragrantes  Saffron Jasmin Flowers c    Ambrosiaci  Musk Musk Crainsbill c    Alliacei  Garlic Assa Foetida c    Hircini  Herb Robert Stinking Orach    Tetri  Opium Henbane Corianders    Nauseosi  White and black Hellebore To∣bacco  The specific effects of each of these classes are then briefly explained and their reputed mode of operation This paper may be considered as a comment on section of the  Philosophia  and properly accompanies the  Sapor Medicamentorum  beforementioned  NOCTILUCA MARINA  C F Adler    Mr  Adler  who went as surgeon in a  Swedish East India  ship to  China  in first gives an account of those authors who have treated on the luminous appearance of the sea water in storms and in the current occasioned by the course of  ships and then proceeds to inform us that it was not till the year that this phaenomenon was certainly discovered to be owing at least in many parts of the ocean to an inconceivable number of minute insects One of these is the subject of this paper and is completely described and a figure given as augmented by the microscope It is of the  Vermes  class and the  Mollusca  order and stands in the  System  under the name of  Nereis Noctiluca  p being the first of eleven species there de∣scribed Its real length does not exceed the th part of an inch  Later writers have thrown more light on this discovery by exhibiting a great variety of these living  Phosphori  RHABARBARUM  S Ziervogel    A botanical and medical history of the  Rheum Undulatum  Sp Pl described here under the idea of its being the  true Rhubarb  having been sent from  Russia  as such by Professor  Gerber  to Consul  Sprekelsen  at  Hamburgh  and by him intro∣duced into many gardens The medical history therefore of this plant must be transferred to the  Rheum Palmatum  which is now generally believed to be the true  Rhubarb  of which a description and figure may be seen in the  Phil Trans  vol lv p communicated by Dr HOPE professor of botany at  Edinburgh  who raised it from seeds sent him by Dr  Mounsey  in and under whose culture the plant has greatly thriven and yielded large quantities of good Rhubarb Mr  Pennant  has told us in his late  Tour  that the Duke of  Athol  has produced it in great perfection and pro∣bably if particular interests did not militate against it the importation of this root might soon become unnecessary It is not wonderful that the former plant should have been taken for the  true  Rhubarb as both grow in  China  and about the famous wall  CUI BONO  C Gedner    To what purpose are all the researches of the naturalist A question which only ignorance or incuriosity can dictate We will not pay our readers so ill a compliment as to suppose they need the conviction here referred to Neverthe∣less if there are any who wish to see what reasons may be alledged by the naturalist against those who object the frivolousness and inutility of his researches they will most probably receive some satisfaction from an attentive consideration of this paper which is incapable of abridgment and may be properly read with the th  Curicsitas Na∣turalis  and th  Oeconomia Naturae  The author has introduced a pleasant and instructive allegory which LINNAEUS himself was wont to use on these occasions  NUTRIX NOVERCA  F Lindberg    This tract is very recommendable as contain∣ing a compendious view of every material argu∣ment that has been urged to prove the propriety and advantage of mothers nursing their infants at  their own breast Several observations on the dis∣eases of children are interspersed and some local ob∣servations which lose their force in this country  This subject has been so ably discussed by seve∣ral masterly pens in this kingdom that we shall only observe respecting the present tract that Dr  Lindberg  allows more force than some of our own writers to those arguments which admit of dis∣eases and temperaments being transmissible from nurses to their fosterchildren  HOSPITA INSECTORUM FLORA  J G Forsskahl    The author of this paper begins by giving a general history of all the material writers on Insects and the method in which they have treated the subject whether in relation to the  metamorphoses  and economy principally in the manner of  Swam∣merdam  or by giving a detail of the  species  at large also as  Ray Reaumur  and  De Geer  have done He then does due honour to the Queen of  Sweden  on account of the magnificent museum which her majesty had constructed at the palace of  Drottning∣holm  which is very superb in  Insects Shells Corals  and  Chrystals  c He next exhibits his plan it consists in arranging all such insects as are natives of  Sweden  each under the plant on which it is found or on which it feeds the references being made to the  Fauna  and  Flora Suecica  of LINNAEUS It would be highly acceptable to those who culti∣vate this branch of natural history to see this ar∣rangement augmented by the numerous discoveries  that have been made since the publication of this tract as it is a part of the history of insects not sufficiently attended to before and nothing would conduce more to extend and facilitate the know∣ledge of it or lead more effectually to the means of destroying the noxious species  MIRACULA INSECTORUM  G E Avelin    Intended to awaken curiosity and excite atten∣tion to the study of insects by pointing out the extraordinary instincts and properties with which particular kinds are endued many of whose operations were inexplicable and frequently attri∣buted to other causes  Nothing exemplifies this truth more than the history of a minute insect or rather worm of which we have in this dissertation the first proper intelligence it is very curious and worthy of notice In  Finland Bothnia  and the northern provinces of  Sweden  it was not unfrequently that people were seized with a pungent pain confined to a point in the hand or other exposed part of the body which presently increased to a most ex∣cruciating degree hath sometimes been sud∣denly fatal This disorder was more particularly observed in  Finland  especially about boggy and marshy places and always in autumn At length it was discovered that this pain instantly succeeded somewhat that dropped out of the air▪ and in a moment penetrated and buried itself in the flesh The  Finlanders  had tried variety of applications to no purpose until at length a poultice of curds or  cheese was found the most effectual in easing the pain and the event confirmed that the insect was allured by this application to leave the flesh as on its removal this worm no longer than the sixth of an inch was found in it and thus the cause of this painful disease explained LIN∣NAEUS himself once suffered from this animal the effect here spoken of but we owe the com∣plete history of it and its place in the System to Dr SOLANDER who gave it in to the Royal Academy of Sciences at  Upsal  This worm stands in the System under the name of  Furia Infernalis  p but by what means this creature is raised into the air is as yet unknown  NOXA INSECTORUM  M A Baeckner    A curious and useful paper particularly speci∣fying all those insects that are more immediately hurtful to animals and vegetables They are classed in eleven divisions according to the several sub∣jects on which they prey or to which they bring devastation  Such as are particularly offensive to man Under this head the author seems inclined to favour that opinion which Mr  St André  and some other  French  physicians and philosophers have held in ascribing to  Acari  the cause of many  cu∣taneous  and  contagious  diseases  Such as are destructive within doors to furniture cloaths grain c Among these is particularly mentioned the Seed Beetle  Bruchus Pisi  Syst the cause of great destruction to  pease in  Pensylvania  c and which has found its way into southern  Europe  See also  Kalm  's Tra∣vels i p  English  edition  To fruitbearing trees and culinary herbs  To trees woods stove and greenhouse plants  To cornfields pastures c  To horses horned cattle and other ani∣mals c  The subjects of these three last papers are of great importance in rural economy and would come with all possible propriety into an  Economical Herbal  that should specify in treating upon each plant the species of insect which inhabits or feeds on it  VERNATIO ARBORUM  H Barck    A curious essay perhaps the first on the sub∣ject relating to the  Leafing of Trees  in  Sweden  being the result of a variety of observations made at the request of LINNAEUS himself in almost all the provinces of that kingdom and intended to lead as if by the dictates of nature to the true time of committing the grain to the earth A table is ex∣hibited shewing at one view the days on which species of trees all natives of  Sweden  put forth their leaves in three successive years The same table shews also the day on which  Barley  was sown and reaped in all the same provinces From an∣other table it appears that at  Pitha  which lies in about degrees north from the average of years there intervene days between the sowing  of barley and its harvest and at  Upsal  in de∣grees the average of six years turned out to be days It is concluded upon the whole that in  Upland  the leafing of the  Birchtree  should di∣rect the time for sowing barley but that diffe∣rent trees will best indicate the time in different places Another curious observation follows from this paper that notwithstanding the difference in the number of days between the ripening of barley in  Lapland  and in  Upland  it will be found that the greater  length  of days in the former coun∣try gives a balance of sun equal to the greater  number  of days in the latter  INCREMENTA BOTANICES  J Biuur    A concise history of the rise fate and progress of botanic science from the first traces of it to the present time divided into four periods or epochs The first includes only the antients by whom are understood  Aristotle Theophrastus Dios∣corides  and  Pliny  who as compilers chiefly did little but deliver the tradition of the times and whose plants after the commentaries of a century cannot be known by their descriptions to this day so little had they extended their ideas to specific distinctions yet we must venerate their writings as the only remains of this science transmitted to our times The second period commences with the restoration of letters after the taking of  Con∣stantinople  by the  Turks  beginning with  Brunfel∣sius  and ending with the  Bauhines  The third which is called the period of  Systematics  is con∣tinued  to the time of LINNAEUS who effected that great reformation in the whole science by which it is fixed as on a new basis The conclusion of this paper contains some information relating to the introduction of figures cut in wood for the old herbals whence it appears that  Plantin  the fa∣mous printer of  Antwerp  monopolized almost all the figures of this kind during his time and be∣came the principal printer in his day for botanical books By such means  Norton  the printer of  Gerard  's herbal procured from  Frankfort  all the figures we see in his book which had before served for an edition of  Tabernamontanus  's herbal in  DEMONSTRATIONES PLANTARUM  J G Hojer    Intended principally for the use of those pupils who attended the botanical lectures in the  Upsal  garden consisting chiefly of a list of the exotics therein cultivated as they stood in this year amounting to near distinct species which in deg min N latitude is no inconsiderable number all double flowers and varieties being entirely excluded After the invention of trivial names this list is the first specimen of the use of them in forming compendious catalogues and is at once an evidence of the utility of them There is an observation in this paper which may appear somewhat paradoxical to some readers several of the plants that are natives of southern  Europe  produced seeds this year without shewing any  corolla  such were  two  Cisti  c It may seem strange too that  Lapland  and alpine plants should perish in the same situation through cold but it is true and the fact is that in their  native  situations they are at the change of season instantly covered with snow and thus defended from injury  HERBATIONES UPSALIENSES  A N Fornander    As the foregoing catalogue comprehends those of the garden this exhibits the indigenous plants of the neighbourhood of  Upsal  as they occur in the simpling excursions which the professor made with the botanical students and were usually per∣formed in about eight days during the course of each summer  INSTRUCTIO MUSEI  D Hultman    The method of constructing a museum for the purposes of natural history in all its branches with directions for collecting preserving and dis∣posing the subjects An enumeration of the best repositories of this kind in  Sweden  such is that of the  Queen  rich in shells insects and corals that of the  King  in amphibia fishes animals of the Vermes class in spirits and the birds of  Sweden  that of Count  Tessin  abounding in fossils and gems shells pictures c that of Chan∣cellor  Gyllenborg  that belonging to the Royal Academy  Stobaeus  's at  Lunden  and  Ziervogel  's at  Stockholm  The method of drying and preserving  plants for an  Hortus Siccus  those of former cele∣brated botanists enumerated A method perhaps more curious than useful of casting an artificial plant by forming a mould with plaister over a real plant placed in a vessel then burning the in∣closed plant to ashes which are to be shook out and the cavity filled with melted silver  This little tract has been published in  Holland  for the use of merchants who deal in the subjects of natural history and something of the same kind has been lately done here  AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE VOL IV pp  PLANTAE OFFICINALES  N Gahn    The scope of this paper is entirely  pharmaceuti∣cal  and howsoever it may be superseded at present it must have been very useful at the time of its pub∣lication having been drawn up for the benefit of the apothecaries in  Sweden  in consequence of some new regulations intended by the royal college of phy∣sicians under the presidentship of Dr  Boeck  and it was also highly acceptable to others as being probably the first list of the  medicinal  plants to which the  Linnaean  synonyms had been accommo∣dated This paper contains  A catalogue of the vegetable simples of the  Materia Medica  amounting to near specify∣ing the parts of each used in medicine to which is opposed the  Linnaean generical  and  trivial spe∣cific  name from the  Species Plantarum  marking  also by a different character all such as the au∣thor thinks might be expunged Then follow directions for rightly gathering and preserving the several plants or such parts of each as are in use  A list of such  simples  as grow spontaneously in  Sweden  many of which had needlessly been imported  Lists of such as might advantageously be cultivated for medicinal purposes to which is finally added a list of such drugs as are imported from the several distant

might without detriment be expunged from the  Materia Medica  The second such as might advan∣tageously be received into that catalogue their vir∣tues having been sufficiently ascertained to justify such an introduction To this latter the author has subjoined under every article the quality of the simple and his authority in general for allow∣ing each its designed rank A paper of this ten∣dency is not unworthy the observation of all those who would improve and enrich the  Materia Me∣dica  and probably considerable additions might be made to this list We add the names of these simples

Lin∣naean  school as laid down in the  Methodus Demon∣strandi  The writer considers the whole race as  reducible to one species and distinguished from other congenerous animals such as the  wolf fox hyaena  c not only by the curvature of the tail which is usually to the left but by the disposition of the  Suturae Velleris  or ridges formed by the meeting of the several courses of hair on divers parts of the body and the number and situation of the  Verrucae  or▪ warty risings in the face In these distinctions heretofore unnoticed all the varieties of this animal agree Eleven varieties of the  dog  kind are here specified after which the properties and uses together with the whole of the economy of this  faithful  animal are fully set forth and his diseases described Our author tells us that the  Laplanders  and  Dalekarlians  are in possession of some secret by which they instantly disarm the most furious dog and oblige him to fly with all his usual signs of fear becoming silent at once and dropping his tail This art how∣ever is said not to be unknown in  England  STATIONES PLANTARUM  A Hedenberg    The intention of this paper is to prove that the knowledge of the  Natale Solum  the natural places of growth of plants is the true foundation on which the art of gardening successfully must be built The author laments that botanists and writers of  Florae  have been too remiss in their ob∣servations of this kind whence numbers of exotic seeds and plants have failed to produce flowers or to perpetuate themselves in gardens He mentions a remarkable instance in the  Nitraria Schoberi  Spec Pl which remained destitute of flowers for years in the  Swedish  gardens at length LINNAEUS rendered it fertile by means of salt scattered about the roots The knowledge of the  Stationes Plantarum  is also equally useful to the practical botanist in assisting his researches  Every plant has its natural situation and soil in which alone it will thrive and out of which in many instances no care or culture will preserve it alive The knowledge of this axiom as far as respects indigenous plants is applicable to pur∣poses of agriculture and with this view the au∣thor has given an arrangement of the  Swedish  plants divided into six classes according to their several places of growth as follows  Aquatics  Alpine  Woodplants  Upland plants  Mountainous  Parasitic  These are again subdivided the aquatics into  marine maritime marsh bog plants  c after which follows the definition of the terms ex∣plaining the nature of these different soils and situations  FLORA ANGLICA  J O Grufberg    At the time of the publication of this paper the  Linnaean  system of botany had made but small progress in  England  to such however as had adopted it this must have been a very acceptable present as being the first arrangement in the  Lin∣naean  method that had been given to the  English  plants as also the first of those compendious  Florae▪  in which the newlyinvented  trivial  names had been exemplified and which have since been much used greatly to the emolument of the science  The author first discusses the utility of such local catalogues and of adhering to the  trivial  names he then briefly describes the climate of  Britain  and its different soils and elevations as favouring the growth of particular plants enu∣merating some of those which are  peculiar  to  Eng∣land  and in what way those of  Sweden  differ from ours He says  Sweden  abounds more in  alpine upland  and  wood▪plants  than  England  which ex∣cels in  marine  plants and such as affect a chalky soil of which latter  Sweden  is almost destitute  Having given due praise to the  English  botanists and particularly to Mr RAY he subjoins the cata∣logue in which there is a reference from each  Linnaean  name to the plant as it stands in the last edition of  Ray  's  Synopsis  by  Dillenius  This  Flora  contains nearly a thousand plants the Mosses and Fungi not being introduced Such as are not found in  Sweden  are distinguished by the Italic type and of these there are nearly three hundred A list of upwards of an hundred which the au∣thor could not investigate concludes the whole  HERBARIUM AMBOINENSE  O Stickman    The  Herbarium Amboinense  is one of the greatest and most magnificent botanic treasures the world ever saw and which we owe to the singular zeal  and industry of RUMPHIUS who lived upwards of years in  Amboina  and was consul there under the  Dutch East India  company He sweetened the leisure hours of his life by an uncommon and suc∣cessful application to the study of natural history which he pursued in all its branches but particu∣larly in botany He had the misfortune to lose his family by the fatal earthquake of and some years after having collected his materials for this work and meditated his return to  Europe  suffered the loss of his sight from a cataract in which state he lived years and died in  This work comprehends the plants of  Amboina Malacca Banda  and the neighbouring islands and allowing for the time when it was written contains excellent descriptions of the several vege∣tables of the  East Indies  with a copious account of their uses and though inferior to the  Hortus Malabaricus  as to the engravings excels it in the history of the subjects There are nearly one thou∣sand vegetables described in this work of which a great number were entirely new to the  European  botanists of this number upwards of seven hun∣dred are engraved  The manuscript was years in the possession of the  Dutch East India  company and was rescued from oblivion by the interest and extraordinary zeal of the editor Professor  Burman  of  Amsterdam  who with great industry and skill has also ex∣tricated the synonyms as far as possible and sub∣joined them to each description He began this  publication in and finished it in in seven volumes folio except a small supplement which was not published until In the editor rendered his work still more useful by the publication of an alphabetical  index  to these volumes with the  Linnaean  synonyms together with a like one adapted to the  Hortus Malaba∣ricus  The pupils of the  Linnaean  school much re∣gretted that the  Herbarium Amboinense  had not been completed before the publication of LINNAEUS'S  Species Plantarum  that the synonyms might have been introduced To remedy this defect was the intention of Mr  Stickman  's paper in which the sub∣jects are arranged in the order of the original work with the  Linnaean  name annexed to each and afterwards as many as could be extricated are thrown into a  Flora  according to the Sexual system  It is to our neighbours the  Dutch  that the bo∣tanists are obliged for two of the most valuable performances that are yet extant in the history of foreign vegetables this of  Rumphius  and the  Hortus Malabaricus  of  Rheede  But we hope that it will not be long before they will be more indebted to an illustrious  Englishman  who in pursuit of the same object has encountered the perils of a cir∣cuit round this globe for a work which from his taste his liberality and zeal for the promo∣tion of science may be expected to surpass those abovementioned as well in extent as in gran∣deur and elegance of execution  CERVUS TARANDUS  C F Hoffberg    In this tract we have a complete history of the  Reindeer Cervus Tarandus  Syst Nat p an animal which almost solely constitutes the riches not only of the  Laplander  but of the other arctic inhabitants of the globe In  Lapland  more particularly the whole  res pecuaria  respects this animal as it is in that country in a more especial manner domesticated In summer the  Reindeer  feed on various herbs but reject a considerable number that are eaten by others Of the parti∣cular species thus refused the reader is presented with a catalogue from the experiments of a curi∣ous observer In winter they are solely sustained by the Reindeer liverwort  Lichen Rangiferinus  or  Coralline Moss  with which the alps of the north are covered The  Reindeer  are obnoxious to many diseases which are all here distinctly de∣scribed and particularly those arising from the  Gadfly  called after its name  Oëstrus Tarandi  Syst Nat which deposits its eggs on the back of these animals and in consequence of which immense numbers of the  Deer  perish yearly See also  Flor Lappon  p  OVIS  J Palmaerus    This dissertation contains the natural history of the Sheep on the same plan as that of the forego∣ing paper and abounds with many curious ob∣servations The genus species and varieties are described and many physiological observations  given A list of those plants which the sheep does not eat amounting from the experiments of the  Pan Suecus  to upwards of species some pointed out that are particularly grateful of which number are the  Sheep's Fescue Grass Fes∣tuca Ovina  Sp Pl p the  Thlaspi Bursa Pastoris  or Shepherd's Purse and an enumera∣tion of

observations are evidently the result of long acquaintance and attention He says they are deli∣cate food  HORTICULTURA ACADEMICA  J G Wollrath    This paper is intimately connected with N  o  the  Stationes Plantarum  It exhibits a com∣pendious system of the principles of gardening particularly as applicable to botanical or aca∣demic gardens In the beginning it is laid down as an axiom "that the whole depends on a per∣fect knowledge of the climate of each plant and the soil in which it flourishes in its own climate" As a striking instance of the necessity of paying re∣gard to proper soil and to induce curious people who transmit seeds and plants to  Europe  to be more accurate in this particular the writer mentions that of the  Ricotia Aegyptiaca  Spec Pl p which no management could bring to flower and fruit until LINNAEUS suggested mixing the  Ar∣gilla Nilotica  the clay of the  Nile  with the earth in the pot and which very soon fully succeeded  The  Linnaean  terms applicable to the several kinds of gardens are defined the heat of the dif∣ferent climates ascertained by  Celsius  's thermometer and the various soils and situations proper to each enumerated  CHINENSIA LAGERSTROMIANA  J L Odhelius    At the time that LINNAEUS'S great patron Count  Tessin  was chancellor to the King and president of the Royal Academy of Sciences he obtained by the concurrence also of M  Lagerstrom  then coun∣sellor of the chamber of commerce and director of the  Swedish East India  company an order that each ship should be provided at the expence of the Company with a naturalist wholly devoted to his proper pursuits To this institution we owe the discoveries made by  Ternstrom Toren  and  Osbeck  and in consequence M  Lagerstrom  who was him∣self a man of letters and a friend to science pro∣cured at his own expence a great number of natural curiosities from  China  and the  East Indies  which he presented to the museum of the univer∣sity at  Upsal  Among these particularly was a collection of the medicinal plants preserved in the apothecaries shops in  China  also a  Chinese  herbal in volumes in vo of which two consist en∣tirely of figures  The tract before us is a scientific description of more than subjects of natural history chiefly birds and fishes collected from  China  by M  La∣gerstrom  It is still of value as being referred to from the System of our author  CENTURIA PLANTARUM  A D Juslenius    CENTURIA II PLANTARUM  E Torner    These tracts contain the descriptions of very rare or heretofore undescribed plants sent to  LINNAEUS from various parts of the world Those described in the second  century  were transmitted by  Seguier  from  Verona  by  Sauvages  from  Mont∣pelier  by Dr  Burman  who had received his from the  Cape of Good Hope  and some by Mr  Miller  of  Chelsea  The time elapsed since the publication of these papers hath not lessened the usefulness of them since they are closely connected with the  Species Plantarum  are referred to in that work and remain as so many illustrations of the system of LINNAEUS  SOMNUS PLANTARUM  P Bremer    The subject of this paper at the time of its publication excited the attention of the curious throughout  Europe  That nocturnal change to which certain plants are liable and which is here analogically called  Sleep  is more particularly manifested in those vegetables that are furnished with pinnated leaves and of these the  Diadel∣phous  class affords the greater number The change consists in the different position which the  folioles  or small leaves assume in the  night  time from that which they exhibit by  day  Slight no∣tices of this faculty are met with in the antients in this paper the observations have been extended so far as to take in upwards of species which are here enumerated and divided into ten classes according to the differences observable in the po∣sition of the leaves during this sleeping state The late Dr  Hill  by a wellinstituted set of expe∣riments fully confirmed the idea that this change  was owing to the absence of light His experi∣ments were made with the  Abrus Precatorius  or scarlet  Indian  Pea in which plant this change had been observed by  Prosper Alpinus  and in which it is remarkable  The novelty of this paper induced the author of this volume soon after its publication to give the substance of it an  English  dress and it was pub∣lished in the  Gentleman's Magazine  for the year p to which the  English  reader who wishes for further information is referred  FUNGUS MELITENSIS  J Pfeiffer    This plant notwithstanding the name it bears is very far removed from the  Fungus  tribe since it produces perfectly distinct flowers and belongs to the  Monandria  order of the  Monoecious  class and is called by LINNAEUS  Cynomorium Coccineum  Sp Pl The  Maltese Fungus  is a parasitical plant singular in its form which is little more than that of a simple stalk about a finger's thick∣ness and six or seven inches long and in its state of fructification the whole plant may be consi∣dered as an  Amentum  or Catkin It is found on the coast of  Barbary  in  Sicily  and sparingly in  Malta  springing from the roots of trees and shrubs as does the  Asarum Hypocistis  with which it also agrees in its sensible qualities and effects and is much esteemed and used in the countries above mentioned as an astringent medicine The writer of this paper gives us from the  Acta Bononiensia  a detail of experiments made with this and several  other subjects of the same class to determine their comparative astringent and antiseptic powers on the human blood from the result of which he tells us that the author was led to consider this  simple  as one of the safest and most powerful astringents  METAMORPHOSIS PLANTARUM  N E Dahlberg    The subject of this paper will scarcely admit of an abridgment agreeable to our contracted plan In order the more clearly to understand what the author calls the  Metamorphosis Plantarum  he delivers in a brief way the  Linnaean  doctrine of the physio∣logy of plants which supposes that the  flower  is no other than the expansion or evolution of the trunk or stem in the following arrangement namely that the  Cortex  or outer Bark is ulti∣mately spent in forming the  Perianthium  or Cup the  Liber  or inner Bark in forming the  Corolla  or Petal the  Lignum  or woody part in forming the  Stamina  or Chives and the  Medulla  or pithy part in forming the  Pistillum  or Pointal Hence what∣soever causes can disturb the usual natural and re∣gular expansion and evolution of these parts may be supposed to occasion great variety and changes in the appearance of plants and that such effects are brought about by change of climate different soil situation air culture and perhaps various other yet unknown causes is certain To these sources must be traced the varieties we observe in the leaves flowers and roots whether permanent as is the case in some instances or not This  doctrine is here illustrated and confirmed by nu∣merous examples and the young and inexperi∣enced botanist is guarded against the delusion frequently occasioned by the operation of these causes which are very extensive in the vegetable creation  CALENDARIUM FLORAE  A M Berger    The  Calendar  of Flora is intended to exhibit the progress of the seasons as they are manif  sted by the times of the flowering of vegetables which in each species appears to be determined from some fixed law of nature and from the due ob∣servance of which after a sufficient course of ex∣periments had been made the author thinks that the sowing of grain and many other branches of rural economy dependent on the seasons might in every country be better regulated than by the rules in common use The tables in this tract were formed from observations made on the com∣mon plants of  Sweden  in the  Upsal  garden in This affair is also connected with the re∣turn and departure of migrating birds and fur∣nishes many curious and useful hints but we do not enlarge as this  thesis  was translated and pub∣lished with an  English Calendar of Flora  by the late Mr  Stillingfleet  to which we refer our readers for more ample satisfaction See also the  Vernatio Arborum  N  o  of this collection a paper strictly connected with the Calendar of  Flora  FLORA ALPINA  N N Amann    The alps of  Europe  produce a set of vegetables very different from and incapable of culture in the lower situations The author of this tract who was a native of one of the provinces border∣ing on the  alps  of  Lapland  with a laudable zeal for the improvement of his country enquires what kinds of vegetables might be cultivated in those desart regions to the most advantage where so few thrive where shrubs scarcely ever attain even a moderate size and where a tree will hardly grow erect  To this end he first enumerates all the alpine parts of  Europe  and gives a list of plants pe∣culiar to those situations He expresses a wish that at the royal or public expence a garden might be planted in the  alps  to determine with precision what exotic plants would bear introduction into  Lapland  and concludes by pointing out some of the esculent and medicinal kinds as also some that are applicable to dyeing and other arts which he thinks might be culti∣vated to advantage in that northern region  FLORA PALAESTINA  B J Strand    Many commentators have employed themselves in determining the plants of the sacred writings among whom none are thought to have been more successful than the late learned Professor  Olaus Cel∣sius  in his  Hierobotanicon  who was not only well qualified by his skill in the learned languages and  particularly in the oriental but was himself also an excellent botanist He lamented that by a sin∣gular fate whilst the missionaries of the  Romish  church had in various other parts of the world been very instrumental in improving natural science  Palaestine  had been totally neglected hence he was doubly solicitous to recover the collection of his countryman  Hasselquist  and much rejoiced that it was at last redeemed as he hoped a view of the subjects would throw great light on his favourite pursuit of illustrating the  Phytology  of the scriptures  Hasselquist  had particular instruc∣tions to attend to this point how well he performed this function is proved by the pre∣sent  Flora  which is chiefly drawn from his dis∣coveries  This catalogue is compiled in the same com∣pendious method as the other  Florae  of these vo∣lumes after the  generical  only the  trivial  name be∣ing cited The author has also availed himself of other helps from those travellers whose skill in this part of knowledge was indisputable some plants he has introduced on the authority of  Rau∣wolf Prosper Alpinus Shaw Pocock  and  Grono∣vius  The whole number amounts to six hundred species Mr  Strand  has applied  Celsius  's names to his list wheresoever it was possible but the curi∣ous will regret that the learned author of the  Hie∣robotanicon  did not live to give the public another edition of his work after such new materials had come to his hands  FLORA MONSPELIENSIS  T E Nathhorst    The happy climate and variety of soil and situa∣tion of  Montpelier  renders this  Flora  one of the most copious of any The vicinity of some con∣siderable mountains and forests and the maritime situation of the place conspire to favour the growth of the plants of northern  Europe  and of northern  Africa  many of which are common to the  East  also This catalogue is compiled from the  Botanicon Monspeliense  of  Magnol  and the  Methodus Foliorum  of  Sauvages  The  Flora Monspeliaca  has since been greatly enriched by the publications of  Gouan  FUNDAMENTA VALETUDINIS  P Engstrom    The author of this thesis derives the foundation of firm health and vigour of constitution from two sources st Good stamina transmitted by pa∣rents dly Care taken in the education from the birth to the perfect state of adolescence From the first he thinks that strength in the  nervous  system and from the second that strength in the  vascular  system must be derived In considering his first position he has in a concise manner thrown together a variety of arguments which he endeavours to confirm by the most respectable authorities to prove that various disorders are transmissible to the offspring also that inde∣pendent of the specific disorders thus transmitted from the parent others arise in children from enervated and debauched progenitors To the  first class he refers  Mania  Epilepsy Gout Stone and some others to the latter particularly the Rickets In considering his second position he prescribes the appropriate regimen to the mother during pregnancy and for the nurse whom he would always suppose to be the mother and finally concludes with some forcible persuasives to young men not to defeat these desirable ends by a course of intemperance  SPECIFICA CANADENSIUM  J Von Coelln    In the first chapter of this tract the writer after presenting us with a view of the progress of medical science through the several schools and sects of physicians and condemning that  sarrago  of compound medicines with which the practice of physic hath been so long burthened considers the return to a more simple mode of prescribing as in∣timately connected with its improvement This leads him to his subject which is intended to exhibit and recommend to the notice of physicians a num∣ber of simples from the vegetable kingdom used by the natives of  North America  in the cure of their diseases some of which may be worth the notice of  European  physicians These may be considered as constituting the  Materia Medica  of the  Indians  among whom as with other barbarous nations all that can be called physic depends en∣tirely on the empirical application of simples nor can it be doubted that long experience hath con∣firmed the efficacy of many to them  This catalogue is chiefly compiled from  artram  's appendix  Colden  's papers in the  from the communications of  is not within our plan to de∣tail  pects of

Johnson  who purchased it of the  Indians  at a great price this is much more largely treated of by  Kalm  The virtues of many of these plants are confirmed by  Colden  The  Spigelia Anthelmintica  or Indian Pink the  Phyto∣lacca Americana  Pokeweed  Polygala Senega  are all considered and the  Geum Rivale  or Mountain Avens which is used instead of  Peruvian  Bark and that with great confidence in  North America  The catalogue contains near plants and the author finishes by proposing a certain number of these which appear to be most worthy of regard to be cultivated in  Europe  for medicinal purposes such are the  Aralia Nudicaulis  naked bastard Angelica  Collinsonia Canadensis  called Horseweed  Lobelia Siphylitica  blue Cardinal Flower  Rumex Britannica Virginian  Waterdock  Polygala

advan∣tages and disadvantages of eating crude vegetables shewing to what constitutions such food is adapted and having treated largely on the qualities of  Oil  and  Vinegar  gives a catalogue and describes the sensible qualities and powers of the different vege∣tables eaten in the various parts of  Europe  as  Sallads  Eighteen different sorts are here enume∣rated most of which are superseded

Mulberry  The writer thinks it probable that  silk  was first wrought by the  Chinese  from whom the art might pass to the  Per∣sians  The Emperor  Justinian  attempted to intro∣duce this worm into  Italy  but it did not then suc∣ceed neither was the true culture of it brought to perfection until about the year in  Sicily  from whence it spread into other parts of  Europe  The author mentions a species of  Bombyx Pha∣laena Atlas  Syst Nat p the coccoons of which are abundantly larger than those of the  Silkworm  and the silk much stronger but it is to be regretted that they are difficult to wind and are  therefore commonly spun We fear that M  Ly∣man  is rather sanguine in thinking that the culture of the  Silkworm  may succeed in so northern a cli∣mate as  Sweden  MIGRATIONES AVIUM  C D Ecmark    This paper is confessedly one of the most com∣plete that has been published on this curious sub∣ject which is yet involved in considerable obscu∣rity the  cause  of these migrations with respect to several birds and the places of their resort being yet unknown With respect to the greater number it cannot be doubted but that the facility of find∣ing their appropriate food in distant countries in the different seasons and their security during in∣cubation have the principal share in this part of their economy  Mr  Ecmark  observes that the greater number of migrating birds belong to the  flatbilled  order  Anseres  particularly to the Goose and Merganser  genera  and to the Waders  Grallae  the former mostly breed in the extreme north where from the relation of LINNAEUS their number almost darkens the air and they are driven southward by the freezing of the lakes and rivers Numbers also of the smallbilled birds  Passeres  especially those with  slender bills  are of the migrating class The  insectivorous  retire southwards when our winter advances as  others  in that season visit us for the sake of berries  It is no small merit in Mr  Ecmark  that in this paper he brings together in one view more com∣pletely  than any other writer had done all the known species of migrating birds whether exotic or indigenous to  Sweden  He gives a list of all such as are mentioned in the writings of  Catesby Klein  and  Hasselquist  but the most considerable part of his tract is employed in a methodical enu∣meration of the indigenous birds of  Sweden  under each of which he mentions as fully as is yet pos∣sible the particular times of their several migra∣tions the places whither they resort their food c and intersperses many other remarks equally curious and satisfactory to those who wish for in∣formation in this part of natural history  AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE VOL V pp  MORBI EXPEDITIONIS CLASSICAE  P Bierchen    The author of this tract was physician to the fleet of observation which was fitted out in the beginning of the last war between  England  and  France  by the  Swedes  to act in conjunction with the  Danes  in the north sea The  Swedish  squa∣dron consisted of eight ships of the line besides frigates When M  Bierchen  took his appoint∣ment in  August  he found not fewer than men on the sick list and that the principal diseases were  Fluxes Fevers  and the  Scurvy  The  first  were attended with great pain in the bowels extreme weakness fever and a very weak pulse The  Fevers  were of that kind which has been  called the  Upsal Fever  from its having been re∣markably epidemical in that city and neighbour∣hood This disease was evidently of that class which is called  putrid  and was much more acute in summer than in autumn It was at∣tended with frequent and obstinate  haemorrhages  from the nose early in the disease a quiet kind of  delirium trembling tongue twitching tendons deafness petechiae  and  vibices  on the skin As the heat declined  haemorrhages  were not so much observed the disorder attacked with  pain  and  las∣situde  of body  vertigo  and  pain  in the head  cough  and  oppression  of the breast and was afterwards attended with  cardialgia nausea vomiting turbid  and sometimes in the decline  bloody urine  Also great  prostration  of strength  weak pulse  and  sub∣sultus tendinum  were symptoms of this fever and many were seized in the beginning with violent  fluxes  The  Scurvy  seems to have been attended with no other than the usual symptoms  Our author appears to have been very solicitous in his endeavours to find out the cause of the ex∣treme prevalence of this disease in the fleet In the  Scurvy  besides the use of salted meats he attri∣butes much to the want of sufficient exercise on board the ships and confirms the observations of some other writers that the disease independent of regimen or diet decreased when the fleet was out at sea and consequently the ships more agi∣tated by wind and waves and the men more em∣ployed and that it augmented when they were in a state of inaction in port He condemns the use  of fat and lard as difficult of coction and favour∣able to the disease In the cure he recommends acids and says he used principally the  vitriolic  but above all he celebrates the praises of  sour∣krout  for the efficacy of which he also cites the authority and experience of Sir  John Pringle  He considers the  Fevers  as arising from impeded perspiration cooperating with the effects of cold moist and foul air and in  this expedition  he thinks the insufficiency of proper cloathing dur∣ing the  watches  might not unfrequently be found a predisposing cause He is of opinion that the disease was contagious and says many were cured by the early exhibition of  emetics  In the general method of cure the practice laid down by our later writers in  England  was successfully pur∣sued  The  Fluxes  and  Dysenteric  disorders he ascribes particularly to the prevalence of  saline  and  putrid  acrimony in the food of seamen aided by foul air and want of exercise and propagated at length by contagion too  Our author concludes by suggesting that there are two causes of a general and permanent nature which predispose to these diseases in all naval ex∣peditions These are  impure air  and a constant depression of spirits in seamen not hitherto suffi∣ciently attended to and inducing a degree of real  Nostalgia  He seems to be sufficiently aware of the importance of correcting the first and re∣commends strongly the use of  ventilators  to the other it is not easy to apply a remedy He informs us that both  Swedes  and  Swiss  find the greatest  relief in the  Maladie du pais  next to their return home from strong exercise however he hints his wishes that the  pay  of the men was advanced as one of the best means of inspiring them with chear∣fulness and hilarity necessary to counterbalance this evil at least in some degree  To conclude the subject of this paper has been so well treated by several later judicious writers amongst us that the  English  physician cannot ex∣pect to meet with much new matter in this dis∣sertation but it is nevertheless very worthy the regard of all who wish to make themselves acquaint∣ed with the diseases of the navy  FEBRIS UPSALIENSIS  A Bostrom    The fever here described which had been re∣markably epidemical in divers parts of  Sweden  but particularly at  Upsal  for several years before this time and which had by many been supposed to be a new distemper Dr  Bostrom  considers as of the  Remittent  class and common in all other parts of  Europe  He has determined its type to be that of the  Hemitritaea  of LINNAEUS see  Gen Morb  N  o  or the  Semitertian  of authors In some years indeed he observes that it seemed to have changed its form was attended with  Petechiae  and became contagious under which appearance it was named  Febris Petechizans  and  Febris Nervosa  when attended particularly with  delirium  and spasms In its milder state especially in the spring it as∣sumed a regular  quotidian  or  continued tertian  type  In seeking the causes of the frequency of this fever in  Upsal  particularly our author accedes to that opinion which attributes  intermitting  and  exacerbating  fevers to the effects of  moist  and  foul  air and thinks from the situation of the city of  Upsal  the closeness of the streets and especially from the stagnating canals and waters that its pre∣valence in that city may fairly be referred to this cause To confirm his opinion he cites two re∣markable instances of cities rendered free from these fevers by leading off and drying up stagnant and putrid waters  In the  Prognostics  he says a stiffness of the neck was not uncommon and that it usually betokened a long continuance of the disease and frequently ended in convulsions or other dangerous affec∣tions of the nervous system  The cure of this fever was usually begun by giving gentle  emetics  and repeating them for a few days occasionally without which it was observed that the  bark  and other remedies failed to have their proper effect Gentle  paregorics  and saline medicines were interposed and the following preparation of the bark exhibitedOne ounce was infused in five ounces of red wine for a few hours the residuum boiled in water to eight ounces and three ounces of syrup of oranges mixed with this tincture and decoction Of this a dose was given every two hours Dr  Bostrom  entirely forbids bleeding having commonly found it hurtful  FLORA DANICA  G T Holm    This  Linnaean  catalogue of the plants of  Den∣mark  is formed principally from the  Viridarium Danicum  of  P Kylling  published in which comprehends eleven hundred species A few are introduced into this list from  Burser  's  Herbarium  and some from the author's own observations  Dr  Holm  was made Professor of  Economy  at  Copenhagen  and died much

adding briefly their general qualities and the esti∣mation in which they were held by the antients He then specifies the various kinds of bread whe∣ther leavened unleavened or fermented con∣siders it as it is the general food of man the na∣ture of it as a nutriment and the different tenden∣cies to acescency in the several kinds condemning the too liberal use of it by the studious persons of weak

Ocean and a comparison between its inhabitants and those of the Earth intended to excite the young and curious voyager to a more close and diligent investigation of this hitherto almost unknown but

history accompanied with figures of a small plant of the  Cryptogamia  class  Buxbaumia Aphylla  Sp Plant singular in being desti∣tute of leaves it was first discovered near  Astracan  by Mr  Buxbaum  professor of botany and member of the royal academy at  Petersburgh  since that time in divers other parts of  Europe  and was named after the discoverer by  Haller  in conside∣ration of his having enriched natural history with many new plants from his expedition into the countries around the  Caspian  sea for that purpose  EXANTHEMATA VIVA  J C Nyander    The origin of contagious diseases has exercised the pens of many ingenious physicians and vari∣ous theories have been invented all of which are briefly recited in the beginning of this disquisition The author had been led by some singular circum∣stances to incline to that of  Kircher  which ascribes them to  Animalcula  and who has had many fol∣lowers especially in  France  He next proceeds to shew the several analogies that subsist in the symptoms of contagious diseases and as  Animalcula  have been demonstrated in the  Itch  and as he thinks in the  Dysentery  too so he tells us they have been seen in the Measles by  Langius  in the Pestilence by  Kircher  in the Siphylis by  Hauptman  in Petechiae by  Sigler  in the Smallpox by  Lusitanus  and  Porcellus  as also in the Serpigo and other cutaneous affections He then proceeds to adduce all that occurs in de∣fence of this theory from the consideration of facts arising in the following diseases the  Itch Dysentery Hoopingcough Smallpox Measles Plague  and  Siphylis  In the  Itch  the existence of the  Acarus Siro  Syst p is acknowledged and he thinks it not less certain that a species of this genus exists as the cause of  Dysenteries  to this opinion the au∣thor was led by a singular fact that occurred to Dr  Rolander  during his residence in Professor LINNAEUS'S house he had been infested with the  Dysentery  for some time and had been relieved twice by taking rhubarb but the disease recurred commonly at the end of about eight days He was the only one in the house thus affected and was put by the Professor upon examining his  egesta  with a view to prove the truth of  Bartho∣line  's assertion who relates that he had seen the alvine dejections full of the most minute insects in this disease Dr  Rolander  's observation on his own state confirmed the fact and he afterwards discovered that these  Animalcula  were conveyed  into his body in water received from a vessel made of juniper wood This  Acarus  is described in the  System  p Our plan will not allow us to follow the author through the whole of his dis∣quisition it must suffice to say that it is ingenious and well worthy the attention of all those who wish to be acquainted with the doctrine which it favours  TRANSMUTATIO FRUMENTORUM  B Hornborg    The purport of this dissertation is to combat and abolish a longestablished vulgar error which nevertheless prevailed until the time of  Harvey  among some men of considerable knowledge and even now still subsists among the vulgar in some parts of  Europe  namely that one kind of grain was convertible by different soils into an inferior distinct and more useless species thus that  Wheat  in an impoverished soil would change to  Rye  this to  Barley Barley  into  Darnel  this into  Bromegrass Bromegrass  into  Oats  Some of the antients carried their belief farther supposing on the other hand that in fertile lands the reverse would take place As these ideas were repugnant to truth so they were in many cases unfriendly to improvement This author after having ob∣served that among the  Romans  the  Res Rustica  was held in such estimation that even the men of quality themselves disdained not to cultivate agriculture laments that in modern times it is too much ne∣glected by the great he therefore urges gentle∣men  to pursue the history and philosophy of vegetables through the whole extent of them as the foundation of practical improvements With this view he refers them to the many excellent papers thereon contained in this collec∣tion and from the physiology of plants the consi∣deration of the mechanism of them and particu∣larly that of the parts of fructification he shews the futility of the opinion which he had under∣taken to confute and particularly levels his argu∣ments against that part of it which has gained the most belief and remained longest in the minds of his countrymen and the peasants that  Oats  are mutable into  Rye  No notice is taken in this dissertation of the  Secale Cornutum  or Ergot which with other viti∣ated grain has been supposed to occasion the  Necrosis Ustilaginea  vide  Sauvages  's  Nosolog  vol ii p and which lately engaged the attention of the learned in  England  See  Phil Transact  vol lv p and vol lii p  CULINA MUTATA  M G Osterman    In a former paper was exhibited a list of vege∣tables that are eaten in a  crude  state as sallads The present is intended to shew the change which has taken place since the time of the antients in the choice of vegetable aliments by substituting instead of what were then used a number of more bland agreeable and nutritive plants  In this review of the alteration which this part of the culinary system has undergone the author under each article gives a comparative sketch of the qualities of each and shews the superiority of the modern substitute to mention some of the most material  The  Acorns  and  Nuts  of the primitive days have given way to all the variety of sweeter farinaceous seeds and roots  To the  Malvaceous  tribe of plants so much used by the  Greeks  and  Romans  hath succeeded the more grateful  Spinach  And to the  Blite  the  Gar∣den Orach  The rough  Borage  is supplanted by the acescent  Sorrel  and  Asparagus  has banished a number of roots recorded by the  Roman  writers under the name of  Bulbs  though at this day it is not easy to determine the several species  Our author however thinks that the  Parsnip  has undeservedly usurped the place of the  Skirret  The  Bean  of the antients improperly so called being the roots as well as other parts of the  Nym∣phaea Nelumbo  Sp Pl or  Indian  Water Lilly is superseded by the  Kidneybean  The  Garden Rocket Brassica Eruca  Sp Pl eaten with and as an antidote against the chilling  Lettuce  is banished by the more agreeable  Cress  and  Tarragon  The  Apium  by the meliorated  Cel∣lery  the  Pompion  and others of the  Cucurbitaceous  tribe by the  Melon  and the  Sumach Berries  by the fragrant  Nutmeg  The  Silphium  or  Succus Cyrenaicus  which the  Romans  purchased from  Persia  and  India  at a great  price and is thought by some to have been the  Asa foetida  of the present time is no longer used in preference to the  Alliaceous  tribe  To turn from the vegetable to some of the animal substitutes we may mention the  Carp  among  Fishes  as having excluded a great number held in high estimation in antient  Rome  The change of  Oil  for  Butter  of  Honey  for  Su∣gar  of  Mulsa  liquors made of wine water and honey for the exquisite  Wines  of modern times and that of the antient  Zyihus  for the improved  Malt Liquors  of this day are all recited not to mention also the  Calida  of the  Roman Taverns  ana∣logous to our bewitching Tea and Coffee  SPIGELIA ANTHELMIA  J G Colliander    A botanical and medical history of the  Indian Pink  or Wormgrass which has been so much used and so greatly celebrated for expelling worms from the human body  Dr  Colliander  does more than barely treat of the plant having enumerated the several kinds of worms infesting the human species the  Ascaris Vermicularis  and  Lumbricoides  Syst p the  Lumbricus Terrestris  γ ib and the  Taenia  Syst He then gives a distinct account of the symptoms that indicate their presence in the human body and the diseases which they too frequently occa∣sion then follows a distinct catalogue of all the supposed  Anthelminthics  from the vegetable and mi∣neral classes and before he comes to the history  of the plant in question he recites the several simples which have been considered as  Specifics  among these we may note particularly the  Fern  mentioned by  Dioscorides  as anthelminthic and lately published in  France  as such at the expence of the king  The history of the  Spigelia  with a figure annex∣ed is then delivered at large nearly as it stands in  Browne  's History of  Jamaica  and in the  Essays and Observations physical and literary  by Dr  Lining  vol i p  The success of this remedy among the negroes and  Indians  introduced it into practice Dr  Browne  administered it in decoction the  North American  physicians give the powder of the root on which occasion we may observe that subsequent observa∣tions have proved the  South American  and  North American Spigelia  to differ  in specie  the former is figured in  Browne  and the latter in the  Essays  above∣mentioned vol iii p See their botanical distinctions also  Linn  Syst Nat ed xiii p  MEDICAMENTA GRAVEOLENTIA  J T Fagraeus    It is a  postulatum  in the philosophy of LINNAEUS that "the qualities of medicines are in a general way to be determined by their effect on the or∣gans of taste and smelling" And further that the  "Sapida  or those which more sensibly strike the  taste  than the smell do principally operate on the  vascular  and  vital  system" and that the  "Olida  or those which more sensibly strike the organs of smelling operate on the  medullary  or  nervous  sys∣tem" The  Sapor Medicamentorum  of this collec∣tion  N  o  may be considered as a comment on the first part of this general distribution of medi∣cines distinguished by the term  Sapida  and the present  thesis  as an explanation of a large division of the  Olida  here called  Graveolentia  from their strong and ungrateful smell  The combinations of  Sapids  and  Olids  are innu∣merable but that simples strictly of the latter kind do in a sudden and extraordinary manner exert their influence on the nerves is certain though our author contents himself with the fact without enquiring whether the functions of the nerves are performed by means of animal spirits by vibration the medium of electricity or by any other way And from the  Graveolentia  which are the subject of his thesis he justly observes that we derive some of the most powerful remedies Of these he gives a catalogue dividing them into three classes SUBINSIPID ACRID BIT∣TER each of which is subdivided into two orders as the subjects differ in degrees of strength The  Subinsipid  contains chiefly the Narcotics the  Acrid  several of the purging and fetid roots the fetid gums and carminative seeds the  Bitter  con∣tains others of the purging roots and leaves and some of the bitter herbs Under each the au∣thor specifies in technical terms very briefly the quality and the diseases to which it has been ap∣propriated  He then presents us with a concise but very in∣structive theory of the operation of this division of the  Olida  leaving to the consideration of others the  Suaveolentia  after which follows a general  pathology of those diseases which are remedied by the  Graveolentia  In treating on the use of external applications Dr  Fagraeus  appears to be dissatisfied with the common theory of repellents which are usually drawn from the styptic class and thinks that the first class of  Graveolentia  the  Narcotics  which he supposes to induce a relaxation or temporary palsy in an inflamed part more effectually pro∣mote a return of the stagnating and accumulating fluids into the circulation than any styptics can possibly effect and are therefore more justly en∣titled to that term  ARBORETUM SUETICUM  D D Pontin    FRUTETUM SUECICUM  D M Virgander    The design of these papers nearly coincides with that of the  Flora Oeconomica  N  o  having for its object the culture of the native trees and shrubs of  Sweden  and some of exotic origin which time hath naturalized amounting to species In these excellent papers no botanical descriptions are given the name only by which they stand in the  Linnaean  system being introduced the pro∣vinces in which they are most plentifully found the soil in which they best thrive their times of leafing flowering and ripening their fruit their duration the best methods of sowing or propagat∣ing each and their uses as applicable to the arts but particularly in rural economy are concisely and distinctly treated of  At the end of the  Arboretum  are subjoined some  general  rules to secure the propagation and growth  of trees and at the conclusion of the  Frutetum  the author has pointed out the proper kinds of shrubs for all sorts of hedges adapted to different situations and soils  PANDORA INSECTORUM  E O Rydbeck    Mr  Rydbeck  pursues the plan of the  Hospita Insectorum  N  o  the completion of which can∣not but be subservient to the art of gardening agriculture and the economy of cattle in a variety of instances and is even necessary to faci∣litate the enquiries of the entomologist  The author in his preliminary sections presents his reader with a history of the  metamorphosis  of insects from the worm or maggot through that of the chrysalis to the perfect state when it comes out in its full beauty and performs all the functions of its being  The catalogue as that of the  Hospita  exhibits a list of the vegetables of  Sweden  arranged in the sexual method and under each is given the insect which it nourishes It has this advantage beyond the former thesis that the insects are better defined by the more complete addition of the trivial names taken from the enlarged edition of the  System of Nature  which had been published in the interval of these two papers It is accompanied with a plate containing near of the more rare species with references to the numbers in the tenth edition of the  System  SENIUM SALOMONEUM  J Pilgren    A paraphrase and comment on  Solomon  's descrip∣tion of old age which has so frequently employed the pen both of medical and theological critics With the reader's leave this may be called a physio∣logical and pathological explanation of the text not that the author has failed to intersperse suitable moral reflexions  Solomon  's allusions are probably too ob∣scure at this distance of time to admit of uncon∣troverted explanation The present attempt must be allowed to be an ingenious one and worthy of the regard of those who wish to turn their atten∣tion to this subject  AUCTORES BOTANICI  A Loo    We are here presented with an alphabetical cata∣logue of botanic writers amounting to upwards of on the following planAfter the name of the writer follows the time of his birth his rank or profession the period in which he flourished commonly taken from the date of his first publi∣cation the title of which is given in brief and lastly the year of his death The catalogue takes in some authors yet living  Such as have been eminently conspicuous for their merit are in this list denoted by an asterisk affixed to the name After the alphabetic cata∣logue other arrangements of the fame authors take place in one particularly they are arranged according to the countries of which they were natives The catalogue concludes by pointing  out such capital writers as are indispensably neces∣sary to such as would make any considerable pro∣gress in the knowledge and history of botany  INSTRUCTIO PEREGRINATORIS  E A Nordblad    After some pertinent instructions to the young traveller for his conduct in foreign countries and useful hints relating to those requisite qualifica∣tions in which it is to be regretted too many who travel are deficient we are presented with the complete method of keeping a journal on the most extensive scale pointing out whatsoever is worthy of observation It is not easy to conceive a plan of instruction on this head more perfectly described in which the traveller will not only find his memory much assisted by having proper objects of inquiry suggested to him whether in nature or art but the method of arranging them also greatly facilitated  One part of his advice is of the utmost import∣ance without the due and regular observance of which nothing will effectually be done  "Nulla dies sine linea"  He must if he would excel most strictly observe to enter and arrange the observa∣tions of each day before the next arrives  PLANTAE TINCTORIAE  E Jorlin    Intended to bring into one general view all the vegetable substances whether indigenous or im∣ported used in the art of dyeing The author determines the exact plant from which each is  produced adding short observations on the co∣lours they yield and the methods of extracting them In this  Materia Tinctoria  occur many of the indigenous plants of  England  not commonly known to be possessed of any colouring quality and though their use at present may be super∣seded by the facility of procuring better from abroad yet these nevertheless remain fit objects of inquiry with the encouragers of arts The ca∣talogue consists of articles exclusive of a few from the animal

the class of  Vermes  making the last links in the chain of animal na∣ture and thus connecting it with the vegetable kingdom These in opposition to those of the three foregoing orders of the same class which live simple and separate from each other are called  Compound Animals  as being connected together by one common base or support either in the form of irregular or rudelybranched stony masses of a calcareous nature as the  Lithophyta  or Corals or as fixed to one common stalk more or less branched as the  Zoophyta  or Corallines and some others  In order to give a more perfect idea of the na∣ture of these animals the author holds forth the general analogy between animals and vegetables principally to shew that the former are not like the latter endowed with that multiplicative power of propagating themselves without the particular energy and exertion of the generative function whereas the  Animalia Composita  seem to unite these powers since they not only appear to propagate by  eggs  or  viva soboles  but also by progressive extension and ramification  The animals of the LITHOPHYTA like the  Testacea  fabricate their own base of calcareous  matter forming the whole mass into tubes each ending on the surface in pores or cells according to their specific difference where alone the animal seems to dwell and extending these habitations progressively in the manner of vegetables leaving the base at length to perish  The animals of the  Zoophyta  containing the Corallines c particularly the  fixed  ones approach much nearer than the foregoing to vegetables both in their texture and form in general arising as if from a root and forming a stem and branches which are beset at the extremities and articulations with the animals or  Polypes  appearing by the help of glasses like so many flowers  Since this tract was written the subject has re∣ceived much farther illustration from the disco∣veries of the late Mr  Ellis  FLORA CAPENSIS  C H Wannman    In the time of the  Romans  it was a trite proverb  that Africa was the land of wonders  and it still re∣mains true as in these days it affords both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms some of the most stupendous and singular productions of nature From the first discovery of the  Cape of Good Hope  from whence  Europe  has chiefly been furnished with the plants of  Africa  their uncommon aspect so very different from those of  Europe  has attracted the notice not only of naturalists but of all man∣kind and as the mildness of that climate allowed of their cultivation here they soon became fa∣vourites in the  English  gardens  Some of the first  Cape of Good Hope  plants that were brought to  Europe  we owe to  J Heurnius  who sent them to his brother a professor at  Ley∣den  and they are figured in  Bodeus á Stapel's Theo∣phrastus  p among these were the Indian Reed  Canna Indica  the  Haemanthus Coccineus Stapelia  the  Aletris Uvaria  and a few others But the first botanist who visited the  Cape  was  Paul Herman  he collected species then unknown in  Europe  after him  H B Oldenland  a  Dane  and  J Hartog  a  Dutchman  both made collections of  African  plants which at length falling into the hands of the present able professor of botany at  Amsterdam  Dr  John Burman  he published en∣gravings of  ten decads  of the more rare kinds From these materials chiefly the present  Flora  is composed according to the usual plan with the  trivial  names only  Among the plants of the  Cape  there are  genera  peculiar to that part of the world several of which excel all others in the number of species as well as in their uncommon and superb appearance The vast number of species under the same genus so frequently met with in that country strongly favours the idea of the perpetual new origin of plants and that many which elsewhere are only  hybrid  there propagate and become permanent But  Caffraria  beyond all other countries abounds with extensive genera of plants the succulent kinds particularly cover the sandy soil where nothing but the fact could convince us that vege∣tation would in any degree succeed Such are the  Figmarygolds  Mesembryanthema  Aloes  Purs∣lanes  c Among the others we are astonished with the variety of the  Heaths  Ericae  Gerania Protaeae  and  Gnaphalia  Since the publication of M  Wannman  's thesis great discoveries in botany have been made in southern  Africa  by  Thunberg  and  Sparmann  and by Mr  Masson  and we have reason to expect a com∣plete account of the plants of that country from Dr  Laurence Burman  son of professor  J Burman  who has already given us a compendious list of them in his  Flora Indica  FLORA JAMAICENSIS  C G Sandmark    The author begins his  Flora  with a general account of the geography of the island and its produce specifying particularly some of the most useful articles thence imported as  Guaiacum Fustic Ebony Logwood Brasiletto Mahogany In∣digo Sugar Coffee Cotton Pimento  and  Ginger  He then subjoins an account of the two principal works from which his catalogue is compiled these are Sir  Hans Sloane  's History and Dr  Browne  's The former of these writers appears to have been the first  naturalist  who visited that island and he brought back with him species of plants The latter is said to have made a collection amounting to which after the publication of his His∣tory he presented to LINNAEUS As Dr  Browne  followed the  Linnaean  system his book is referred to in this  Flora  PUGILLUS JAMAICENSIUM PLANTARUM  G Elmgren    A description of one hundred and thirty species of the  more rare  among the foregoing plants made from Dr  Browne  's collection which was in the hands of professor  LINNAEUS  NOMENCLATURA PLANTARUM  B Berzelius    Contains the vernacular names of the  genera  of plants particularly of  European  and  garden  kinds in  Italian French English Dutch  and  German  placed in columns opposed to the  Latin  name It would have been an acquisition to have had the plan of this paper extended much farther so as to have included not only the name of the  genus  but that by which each  species  is known in the several coun∣tries a thing too much neglected by almost all writers of local catalogues although highly neces∣sary to render them more extensively useful Nay farther even the provincial names if possible should be collected as they are frequently very different for the same plant LINNAEUS in his  Flora Suecica  is almost the first and only one who has taken due notice of and supplied this defici∣ency There is extant on this subject the  Index Plantarum Polyglottus  of  Mentzelius  published in but the writer of this  Nomenclator  found it insufficient to his purpose neither indeed can the plan be completed otherwise than by the united endeavours of botanists throughout the world  AER HABITABILIS  J V Siefvert    The comprehensive nature of the subject and the concise manner in which the history of the air is treated in this dissertation render it impossible to give a proper abstract in our confined plan This element is here considered in all the various changes to which it is subject its properties un∣der the different and opposite alterations discussed its effects on the earth in the various quarters of the globe and its influence on the health and eco∣nomy of life and manners of the inhabitants  With respect to its  heat  and  cold  in the diffe∣rent quarters of the earth of these the general re∣sult is given according to the computation of the  Swedish  thermometer or  Celsius  's in which is the point of congelation and that of boil∣ing water five degrees in this being equal to nine of  Farenheit  's  Its  dryness  and  moisture  and the general effects of those qualities pointed out The torpid state of the inhabitants of hot countries during summer heat in those countries defoliates trees as cold does in temperate climes  Its  gravity  and the different degrees and effects of it considered  The effects of the different  winds  and their salutary and pernicious tendencies That of  Calms  also In the Isle of St  Thomas  there is a dead calm for two months during which the worst diseases prevail  The effects of an hot atmosphere farther il∣lustrated by the state of the  Indians  Diseases thereby produced in more moderate climates  Temperate air and its exhilarating qualities on the animal creation c    Moist air  and the diseases thence arising    Air  impregnated with  exhalations  of various kinds a comm on cause of fevers dysenteries headach c    Stagnant air  in vaults in subterraneous gra∣naries and mines    Effluvia  from burning substances instances of their pernicious effects largely treated of  Mineral  vapours those from

particularly in its cultured and tame state in which the whole economy also of the animal and its uses to mankind are perhaps more completely treated of than in any other pub∣lication and which cannot fail to be acceptable and useful to those who make this animal an object of merchandize  AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE VOL VI pp  GENERATIO AMBIGENA  C L Ramstrom    The author begins his subject with a concise view of the antient and modern theories relating to this obscure affair He observes that the antient doctrine of  equivocal  generation prevailed in gene∣ral until  Harvey  exploded it and taught that every animal is generated  ex ovo  and that his sys∣tem may now be considered as including a double hypothesis first that taught by himself which supposes the entire rudiments of the future  foetus  to be present in the  ovum  and only waiting for animation from the vivifying principle or  aura genitalis masculina  the other that of the  seminal animalcule  entering into the  ovum  according to the theory arising from  Lewenhoeck  's microscopical discoveries We have before observed that LIN∣NAEUS very early forsook  Lewenhoeck  's theory in consequence of attending  Liëberkuhn  's demonstra∣tions The argument of the present hypothesis tends to shew that both sexes are equally efficient in this work leaning however to the following opinion "that the external form as well as the specific energy of the vital functions are princi∣pally derived from the male parent" This is partly the opinion also of the very eminent Dr  Haller  Phys § Our intended brevity does not allow us to pursue our author through all his  arguments in behalf of his hypothesis we must rest satisfied with observing that after drawing a physiological analogy between vegetables and ani∣mals he thinks it  evident  that in both the  male  is most commonly conspicuous in the  external form  and this he illustrates by several examples of  hybrid  species in both the vegetable and animal king∣dom  POLITIA NATURAE  H C D Wilcke    Intended to display that perfect order and just subordination of all the several parts of nature by which they are rendered mutually subservient to the conservation of each other and of the whole and which collectively considered our author not unaptly has named  the Police of Nature  This physicotheological design is pursued near∣ly on the same plan as that of the  Oeconomia Na∣turae  N  o  by exhibiting  A general view of the  Fossil  kingdom as con∣stituting the surface of the globe and as disposed into land and water hills mountains vallies c  That innumerable variety of  Vegetables  with which the surface of the earth is cloathed and adorned as adapted to the different soils climates and elevations and again as affording nutriment to animals of various kinds  In the  Animal  kingdom a general view of their relations to each other and the proportion they bear in the scale through the several classes from the  Vermes  up to the highest and most per∣fect  in which are considered their specific uses in the general economy  Our author has illustrated his subject by addu∣cing numerous examples from all parts of the  Ve∣getable  and  Animal  kingdom to shew how ad∣mirably the whole is ordained to contribute to the generation nutrition and due proportion of each in the grand fcheme of nature and providence  THESES MEDICAE  J C D Schreber    In this dissertation Dr  Schreber  delivers a brief view of the  Linnaean  doctrine relating to the ana∣tomy and physiology of plants in which he endea∣vours to sustain the following thesesThat all plants consist of a  medullary  and  cortical  substance in the former of which is manifested the life of the plant and through which it is perpetuated either by seeds or buds which are considered as the ulti∣mate extension of this part The  cortical  part is considered as the organ of nutrition to the wholeThat as in a number of certain species of plants which in artificial systems form a  genus  we see a similar proportion and agreement of the parts of fructification howsoever different the external form of the whole plant and as we not unfrequent∣ly see  hybrid  plants produced he therefore proposes it as a matter worthy of speculation whether ori∣ginally  all  the species have not been produced in the same way by the various admixtures of the  farina  From this power in the  medullary  part of perpetuating itself and modifying the whole  internal structure the author also deduces the similar qualities which are commonly found in plants of the same genus as manifested by the  taste  and  smell  FLORA BELGICA  C F Rosenthal    A  Linnaean Flora  of the indigenous plants of the  United Provinces  compiled from the catalogues of  Commeline  printed in and of Dr  David de Gorter  printed in at that time professor at  Harderwick  and afterwards physician to the Em∣press of  Russia  The author refers to the page for each plant in both these works He premises a general account of the country with respect to its divisions into provinces the climate the inha∣bitants the commerce enumerates their univer∣sities and gardens then gives concise lists of the plants found in particular situations in the canals for instance on the dykes in the woods osieries c  The plants of  Holland  as far as soil and situa∣tion admit are nearly those of  England  but as the country is destitute of mountains rapid rivers alps and chalky soil a great variety are necessarily excluded  These works are superseded by an enlarged edition of Dr  De Gorter  's book under the title of this thesis printed in and which contains upwards of species  ANTHROPOMORPHA  C E Hoppius    The history of the  Simia  genus especially as it respects those species which so nearly approach the  human form and feature is yet involved in no small obscurity After a general account of the manners of these animals the reader is here presented with an history of four remarkable species    Simia Pygmaeus  the Wild Man of the Woods described and figured by  Edwards  t  Simia Satyrus  Syst p    Simia Satyrus  of  Tulpius  which LINNAEUS considers as the same animal with the foregoing differing only in having the abdomen more promi∣nent and less furnished with hair    Simia Lucifer  or  Homo Caudatus  of  Bontius  said to exist in  Java  and  Nicobar  of which tra∣vellers have related strange stories The author describes this animal on the authority and testi∣mony of  Koping  a  Swede  who asserts that he had seen both male and female nevertheless it may justly be suspected that there is somewhat of fable or much exaggeration mixed with this relation The reader may see more relating to this animal and  Koping  's book in a letter from LINNAEUS himself to the author of "The Origin and Pro∣gress of Language" vol i ed d p note    Simia Troglodytes  or Orang Outang of  Bon∣tius  the  Homo Nocturnus  or  Troglodytes  of the Syst Nat p Concerning these the author takes great pains to prove that they are really children of darkness and incapable from the ex∣treme dilatation of the pupil of seeing in the day∣time The length of the arms would incline one to rank this creature with the  Gibbon  of M  Buffon  or that of which an account accompanied with a figure was transmitted by Mr  De Visme  from  Can∣ton  and published in the  Phil Trans  vol lix p t See also  Lin Mant alter  p Figures of these several animals taken from the respective authors accompany this dissertation  PLANTAE AFRICANAE RARIORES  J Printz    Of all the quarters of the globe no one dis∣plays such luxury and variety in the production of plants as southern  Africa  from whence the  European  gardens have derived their most superb and ornamental species This catalogue contains the description of a century of the most  rare  some entirely new and others before imperfectly noticed It was drawn up by the author from an inspection of the plants themselves in a collection sent from  the Cape of Good Hope  with a view of which Dr  Laurence Burman  gratified LINNAEUS when he paid him a visit in the summer of Extremely different as the plants of  the Cape  are from those of  Europe  many of the latter nevertheless thrive well in that climate The author has prefixed a list of kinds which occurred in looking over this collection He concludes this paper with a list of  African  plants as an  Appendix  to the  Flora Ca∣pensis  N  o  before published in this collection It comprehends near species from  Oldenland  's  Herbarium  made in Mr  Printz  's catalogue is yet of use as being referred to from our author's  Species Plantarum  MACELLUM OLITORIUM  P Jerlin    Under this title our author includes the plants of the kitchengarden and we are here presented  with a catalogue amounting to kinds of culi∣nary herbs principally such as are found sponta∣neously growing or are easily cultured It is drawn up on the same plan with LINNAEUS'S  Ma∣teria Medica  specifying briefly the duration of each whether annual biennial or perennial the part of the plant in use and the mode of dressing it after these follows a brief indication of the taste or other sensible qualities and their reputed effects on the human body  The author divides the culinary herbs into three classes  Roots and these into fusiform and tuberous  Stalks comprehending particularly the young and blanched shoots as  Asparagus  and the  disk  of the flower such is the Artichoke  Leaves divided into  Olera  or boiling herbs sprouts and greens and  Accetaria  or sallads eaten crude  Our author commends  Parsnips  in preference to Turnips and Carrots as being less flatulent and more nutritive He condemns the use of  Mush∣rooms  says the  disk  and the young stalks of the Cotton Thistle  Onopordon Acanthium  may be eaten and resemble Artichokes It is here re∣peated that  Cellery  is prejudicial to people subject to nervous disorders The contents of this paper would enrich an  Economical Herbal  MELÖE VESICATORIUS  C A Lenaeus    A complete history of the  Melöe Vesicatorius  Syst p or the Blistering Fly or Beetle an  insect of the  Coleopterous order  with filiform an∣tennae and distinguished from the other  genera  by the rounded thorax and gibbous inflexed head The species in common use is found all over  Eu∣rope  more or less on the  Privet  the  Ash  and the  Elder  but there are also three others endued with the same vesicating acrimony two of which are  European  and the other common all over the  East  and particularly in  China  where it is used in the shops and there are many reasons mentioned by our author to prove that this last the  Meloe Cichorii  Syst is the true  Cantharis  of  Dios∣corides  After a copious natural history of the insect our author gives the form of several vesicating plasters and prescribes the places and mode of application In his last chapter which is profes∣sedly medical he treats on the internal and external use of  Cantharides  principally considering how far they are safe and useful as diuretics when admini∣stered internally under this head he introduces a case which furnishes a caution against the use of them as  Aphrodisiacs  After premising some general observations on the action and use of blisters he con∣cludes by enumerating all those diseases in which they are salutary and those in which they are par∣ticularly contraindicated In  England  where it is thought the use of blisters is better ascertained than in some other nations the intelligent physi∣cian will not expect to meet with much new matter on this subject  DIAETA ACIDULARIS  E Vigelius    It is not surprizing that in a country abounding with iron chalybeate waters should be frequent In fact these  Acidulae  are so in  Sweden  and their efficacy has been known and much extolled in that country as our author observes from the most antient times He thinks the inhabitants of those northern climes were led to the frequent use of the  Acidulae  by long experience of the salutary effects of them as  diuretics  and  tonics  in remedying the inconveniences arising from a long winter's diet of salted meats which dis∣posed the constitution to scorbutic cachectic and dropsical disorders The later physicians of  Sweden  have regulated the use and confirmed the good effects of them and Mr  Vigelius  in this disser∣tation has in a concise elegant and perspi∣cuous manner prescribed the regimen adapted to such as enter upon a course of these waters digested under the six wellknown heads of the  Nonnaturals  POTUS COFFEAE  H Sparschuch    A very circumstantial botanical and medical history of the Coffeetree and its fruit  Coffaea Arabica  Sp Pl p The writer is one of the last of authors who have written professedly on this shrub all of whom he enumerates by name with the date of their writings from to  Kalm  's treatise in  Coffee originally the produce of  Arabia Felix  where the best is  now  most successfully culti∣vated is called by the  Egyptians Bon  and is first mentioned by the  Arabians  about the year Our author says it was brought into  Eu∣rope  about the year and that the first public coffeehouse was set up at  Marseilles  in The shrub itself was introduced into the  European  gar∣dens about the year by means of seeds pro∣cured from  Arabia  by Governor  Van Hoorn  of  Batavia  who also first cultivated it in  America  at  Surinam  We are next presented with the classical gene∣rical and specific character of this plant to which succeeds a copious list of synonyms and the description at large as it stands in the  Hortus Cliffortianus  The culture of the shrub the pre∣paration of the berry the different times and modes of drinking this liquor which custom hath established in the various nations and the  succe∣danea  to this berry are then discussed Among the latter are mentioned  Pease Beans Beechnuts Almonds Maiz Wheat  and the seeds of the  Sun∣flower Helianthus Annuus  Vide  Gouan Flor Monsp  p Of these he prefers Almonds but he observes that they dispose to flatulency much more than Coffee  In speaking of the qualities and virtues of Cof∣fee our author thinks it should rather be classed with medicines than considered as a nutritive ar∣ticle in diet He appears to be no friend to its frequent and indiscriminate use he thinks it de∣stroys rather than creates appetite that it occasions  watchfulness  and promotes  flatulence  and  indigestion  instead of relieving them as is generally believed that it  debilitates the nerves  and occasions  tremblings  On this occasion he thinks it worth enquiry whe∣ther it may not contribute to those sudden deaths which are frequent at  Stockholm  about the winter solstice as they have been observed to happen to such as were inordinate drinkers of this liquor that it is  antiaphrodisiac  he says is generally al∣lowed and he illustrates and confirms this qua∣lity by a pleasant tale from  Olearius  's Travels that it  weakens the sight  is noxious to  melancholic hypochondriacal  and  hysterical  people that it pro∣motes  hemorrhages  of all kinds and that a free indulgence in the use of this liquor cannot be safe except to the corpulent  Considered as a medicine from its heating qua∣lity it is forbidden in  fevers  From its stimulating and drying quality allowed by all physicians is deduced its usefulness in  corpulency  and in the  leucorrhaea  It has been considered as an  anthel∣minthic  but its ill effects on the tender habits of children more than balance any good ones in that way In  soporose affections  in  phlegmatic  and  cor∣pulent  habits our author allows its use and from its known effect in promoting hemorrhages it must be considered as an  emmenagogue  That  headachs  are frequently relieved by Coffee is con∣firmed by daily experience and our author relates that LINNAEUS himself found it singularly useful in taking off a  cardialgia  with which he was affected at the time he was physician to the fleet in and which he attributed to the effluvia of the hos∣pital  as it constantly succeeded his morning visits to the sick  INEBRIANTIA  O R Alander    Inebriants are almost universally derived from vegetables They are defined by our author to be such things as affect the nerves in a particular and agreeable manner and through them alter and disturb the functions of the mind They are pro∣properly divided into  native  and  artificial  the for∣mer chiefly in use among the oriental and other nations the latter principally throughout  Europe  Of  native Inebriants  the following are enumerated and the mode of administration and effects of them described    Opium  in use all over the East and of which the  Turks  through custom swallow a drachm    Peganum Harmala  Sp Pl Syrian Rue The seeds are sold in  Turkey  for this purpose and with these as  Bellonius  relates the  Turkish  Emperor  Solyman  kept himself intoxicated    Maslac  of the  Turks  or  Bangue  of the  Per∣sians  prepared from the dust of the male flower of  Hemp  or from the leaves    Bangue  of the  Indians  from the leaves of the  Hibiscus Sabdariffa  Sp Pl  Seeds of various species of the  Datura  or  Thorny Apple  of which see  Rumph  Herb  Amb  p    Pinang  or  Betle  of the  Indians  Roots of  Black Henbane Hyoscyamus Niger  Sp Pl  The  Hyoscyamus Physaloides  Sp Pl  Berries of the deadly Nightshade  Atropa

mentioned such are  Clary Saffron  and  Darnel  Artificial Inebriants are  fermented Liquors  from farinaceous seeds  Wines  and  Spirits  drawn by distillation With these our author ranks the  Nectar  of the gods and the anodyne medicine of  Homer  commonly called  Nepenthes  and the spells by which  Medea  and  Circe  produced their inchant∣ments He then in a most striking and lively manner introduces a fable to illustrate the effects of intoxicating liquors on the human frame and passions and after having shewn when they may be safely allowed concludes with cautions and exhortations against the abuse of them  MORSURA SERPENTUM  J G Acrell    In this tract on the venomous bites of  Serpents  after a general description of the structure of this order of  Amphibia  and some observations relating to the  Boa Constrictor  Syst Gigantic Serpent of the  East Indies  and its capacity of ingorging large animals of the fascinating power of the  Rattle Snake  with which also he says the  Coluber Berus  Syst or Viper is in some degree en∣dued the author describes the mechanism of the jaw and the venomous apparatus in Serpents and these are illustrated with a figure He then  gives an abstract of  Redi  's Experiments and dis∣cusses the theory of the operation of the  virus  in the explication of which he inclines to that of the mechanical theorists in attributing the effects rather to an almost instantaneous alteration induced in the fluids than to its immediate action on the nervous system The symptoms ensuing the punc∣ture of the various species are then described those from the  Viper  particularly and those of the  Asp  which kills by inducing  sopor  and  lethargy  Three  Asps  are mentioned by the antients that called  Ptyas  he supposes to be the  Coluber Am∣modytes  of the moderns See Syst p de∣scribed and figured in the  Surinamensia Gril∣liana  of this collection N  o  Besides those of the  Rattle Snake  genus there are eighteen of the  Viper  genus furnished with venomous organs of which a list is subjoined Among these none strike more suddenly fatal than the  Coluber Naja  called  Cobra de Capello  This author next treats briefly on the various re∣medies in use among the antients and notes their general inefficacy He then comes to discuss the three noted antidotes of  Europe Asia  and  America  which are regarded as specifics against the venom of the most dangerous kinds in the respective quarters of the globe such are  Oil of Olives  against the  Viper  of  Europe  the  Ophiorrhiza Mungos  against the  Naja  of  Asia  vide N  o  of this collection and the  Senega  against the  Rattle Snake  of  America  There is nevertheless a small venomous Viper  Co∣luber Chersea  Syst p in  Sweden  against the bite of which the oil of olives failed to produce its  usual good effects and the patient died The author mentions a successful case of the administration of the  Senega  in  Sweden  He concludes with descant∣ing on the  Psylli  of the East or the Charmers of Serpents and tells us that M  Jacquin  of  Vienna  purchased a secret of this kind in the  West Indies  TERMINI BOTANICI  J Elmgren    This paper is incapable of abridgment it is a methodical arrangement and complete explanation of all the  terms  amounting to used in descri∣bing plants according to the  Linnaean  method of botany Somewhat of the same kind was begun in the  Hortus Cliffortianus  and is also prefixed to the enlarged editions of the  System  These terms also necessarily occur and are explained in our author's  Philosophia Botanica  In this paper the whole is amplified improved and methodised in so excellent a manner that no one who would gain precise ideas on the subject would wish to be without it  PLANTA ALSTROMERIA  J P Falk    This plant is of  American  origin and belongs to the  Hexandrous  class and  Monogynous  order of the System There are three species the two first of which were described and figured by  Pére Feuillée  in  Peru  who ranked them with the  Hemerocallis  or Day Lily LINNAEUS received the seeds of this singular and beautiful plant from  Cadiz  by means of  C Alstromer  son of a gentleman of that name counsellor of the College of Commerce in  Sweden  and finding it a new genus gave it his name  The species here so completely described and figured is the  Alstromeria Pelegrina  Sp Pl The virtues of this species are not ascertained but the sensible qualities of the root rank it with the  Sarsaparilla  and it appears by  Feuillée  's ac∣count that there is a third species in  Chili  which the natives use as a substitute for the above plant and LINNAEUS has hence given it the trivial name of  Salsilla  NECTARIA FLORUM  B M Hall    Dulci distendunt nectare cellas  Virgil Georg iv Hence LINNAEUS gave the term  Nectarium  to a particular gland or repository which in most plants contains the honey This part in flowers had been but little noticed before LINNAEUS raised it to importance and in his System it affords an excellent mark of distinction in divers genera and species  Our author premises some short observations relating to the  glands  of plants in various classes which are mostly situated on the leaves or petioles He then proceeds to the direct design of his tract which is to point out the several kinds of  Nectaria  in flowers and to specify the different situation of this part in different classes orders or genera It is therefore an instructive paper to those who would attain a more complete idea of this singular and heretofore neglected part the use of which how∣ever is as yet imperfectly ascertained  FUNDAMENTUM FRUCTIFICATIONIS  J M Graberg    Having briefly stated the improvement of bo∣tany and defined it as a science M  Graberg  proceeds to the explanation of his term Under the word  Fructification  he includes not merely the  Corolla Pericarpium  and  Semina  simply consider∣ed as  Tournefort  had done but also the  Calyx Nectarium Stamina  and  Pistilla  All these parts therefore constitute the organs of  fructification  and on which the  foundation  of all true system must be laid He then briefly traces the rise of system from  Gesner  through the improvements of  Caesalpinus Columna Morison  and  Tournefort  down to LIN∣NAEUS who by defining as above the parts of fructification first laid the basis of true  generical  distinctions He then inlarges on  specifical  dis∣tinctions and shews what constitutes  varieties  in plants He proceeds to consider the generation of  hybrid  plants concerning which he favours the opinion laid down in the  Generatio Ambigena  N  o  of this collection that the internal struc∣ture or parts of fructification in hybrid plants resemble the  impregnated  plant and the habit or external parts that which furnished the  farina foecundans  A singular instance of this kind is brought from the  Verbascum  genus Finally he pro∣poses a question whether all the  species  may not have sprung from one original in each  genus  by hy∣brid impregnations He thinks the contempla∣tion of the numerous species under many  African  and  American genera  adds weight to his hypo∣thesis  On the whole this paper abounds with curious matter for speculation on this subject and is highly worthy the regard of those who would enter more minutely into the knowledge of botany  REFORMATIO BOTANICES  J M Reftelius    We are here presented with a very entertaining history of the rise progress and present improved state of botany To this end it is divided into three epochs Under the  founders  of the science after the restoration of letters Under the  systematics  And under the auspices of the great  Swedish  botanist  Among the restorers of botany  Brunsfelsius Tragus Gesner Fuchsius  and  Cordus  stand foremost in the list They may be said to close with  Caspar Bauhine  who by his incomparable  Pinax  in which he collected all their synonyms into one work gave use to their writings and improvement to the study which otherwise it could not have acquired    Bauhine  having laid this foundation the knowledge of plants made a rapid progress in the seventeenth century and received vast addition from the discoveries of  Cornutus Marcgrave  and  Piso  in  America  from those of  Herman Rheede  and  Commelin  in  Asia  from  Sloane Plukenet Pe∣tiver  and  Sherard  from  Tournefort  and  Plumier  during which period also it was reduced to  system  from the hints of  Gesner  first by  Caesalpinus  and afterwards more successfully by  Morison Ray  and  Tournefort  This author dates the  epoch  of  reformation  from the first publication by LINNAEUS in and then collects together into one view the im∣provement it has received from the labours of this great man He enumerates the several disciples of LINNAEUS who assisted him by their travels into foreign parts adds a list of those writers that have followed his method and closes with a sketch of what is yet wanting to give further perfection to the science  PROLEPSIS PLANTARUM  H Ulmark    The theory of vegetation built by  Malpighi  and  Grew  on the anatomy of plants and that of  Hales  and others drawn from what may be called their physiology has not been followed in the  Linnaean  school LINNAEUS early conceived the idea of an analogy between plants and animals and speaks of vegetables also as consisting of a  medullary  and  cortical  substance in the former of which the pro∣per life and principle of vegetation resides and by which alone it is propagated considering the latter as the organs of nourishment to the former This idea seems also to have led him to adopt the opinion of  Caesalpinus  relating to the evolution of these two parts in the order which is mentioned in the th thesis namely that the  Cortex  or outer Bark is ultimately spent in forming the  Perianthium  or Cup of the flower besides which it must be ob∣served that the leaves are produced from the cor∣tical substance only the  Liber  or inner Bark in the Corolla or Petals the  Lignum  or woody part  in the  Stamina  or Chives and the  Medulla  or pithy part in the  Pistillum  and Seed  Principally to confirm and illustrate these  data  is the design of this  thesis  which in fact is a com∣ment on a part of the th section of the Introduc∣tion to the second tome of the  System  p con∣taining a concise view of this doctrine Before the author proceeds to his immediate subject he reca∣pitulates with the forementioned some other prin∣ciples relating to the life and organization of vegetables and then endeavours to prove by appearances observable in plants that this arrange∣ment of parts and this evolution actually exists As this cannot be so aptly illustrated in annual and other plants on account of the tender texture and quick growth the author endeavours to exemplify it from observations made on the budbearing trees in which he observes that the full evolution of the parts from the origin of the bud to the expansion of the flower as the final act of vegetation in each is a progressive work the ac∣complishment of which requires five or six years and that it takes place in the following order That the  Leaves  which are unconnected with the  medullary  substance and derive their origin from the  cortical  are the produce of the first year and in plants and trees that are furnished with  Bracte  or floral Leaves that such are the issue of the second year and the  Perianthium  or Cup of the flower of the third the  Petals  of the fourth the  Stamina  of the fifth and the  Pistil  c of the sixth Our author endeavours to sustain this theory  by a number of facts and observations tending to corroborate the doctrine advanced in this dis∣sertation  FRUCTUS ESCULENTI  J Salberg    The design of the  Plantae Esculentae  N  o    Ace∣taria  N  o  and the  Macellum Olitorium  N  o  is in this paper pursued and extended to the escu∣lent fruits which are here enumerated to the num∣ber of and their nature and uses briefly pointed out To which end they are disposed into six classes as follow  Berries  Plumbs  Pomaceous Fruits  Podded Fruits  Grain  Nuts  PROLEPSIS PLANTARUM  J J Ferber    Mr  Ferber  who is probably the same per∣son that has published  Physicogeographical Tra∣vels into Italy  endeavours in this paper as Mr  Ulmark  hath done to illustrate and con∣firm the theory of vegetation received in the  Up∣sal  school  He first treats on the food of plants which without entering into any subtle disquisitions re∣lating to its elementary principles and composition is defined to be the watery tincture of the soil re∣ceived by the roots and transmitted to the  medullary  by the vascular part of the  cortical  substance He establishes it as a fact that too great an afflux of nutriment thrown into the  cortical  part retards the fructification by compressing the  medullary  He  thinks this is proved by the state of luxuriant plants in general and by the effects of depriving them of this superfluity on which head he quotes the experiments of Mr  Fitzgerald  re∣corded in the  Philos Transact  vol lii p as confirming the truth of the theory here ad∣vanced  After having established the cortical part as the organ and deposit of nutriment he proceeds to shew that  heat alone  excites to action and vigour the life or protrusive and expansive force of the medullary part which is ever spent in propagat∣ing the plant by forming  buds bulbs  or  seed  as its final and most perfect issue and that this in∣tention of nature succeeds in a proportion equal to the degree of nutriment afforded by the cortical to that of the heat administered to the medullary part respectively  In the second chapter M  Ferber  treats on the origin and evolution of buds in which he accedes to the doctrine of the progressive perfection of them mentioned in the dissertation just reviewed  The last chapter is appropriated to the  Involu∣tion of Plants  in the Seed Buds and Bulbs in which he asserts that in the seeds of the  Nymphaea Nelumbo  the very leaves of the future plant are visible In bulbs the rudiment of the next year's plant is also conspicuous in like manner buds contain the perfect plant although the evolution in these requires a longer process  Those who would attain a complete idea of the theory of vegetation advanced in the works of our author are referred more particularly to the  following papers in the  Amoenitates Academicae  N  o    Gemmatio Arborum    Metamorphosis Plantarum    Generatio Ambigena    Prolepsis Plan∣tarum  and to the  Introduction to the Vegetable System  It may be observed that there is a set of ex∣periments made by M  Mustel  printed in the  Phil Trans  vol lxiii p which seem to favour the theory of vegetation here advanced as far at least as relates to the  cortical  substance being the deposit of nutriment and the effect of warmth on the expansive and protrusive force of the me∣dullary Yet it must be allowed that too many difficulties attend every theory on this obscurc subject  CENTURIA INSECTORUM  B Johansson    Insects were scarcely noticed before the time of  Conrad Gesner  whose comprehensive mind extended over the whole field of nature He together with  Mouffet  and  Aldrovand  may be said to have laid the foundation of entomological science To these succeeded another set of writers who were princi∣pally employed in investigating the economy and surprizing metamorphoses of insects such were  Geodart Lister Swammerdam  and  Reaumur  to whom may be added Madam  Merian  who took a voyage to  Surinam  with the sole view of gratifying a taste for this branch of natural history  Nevertheless after all the researches of these in∣genious persons and the labours of our excellent Mr  Ray  a defect of system rendered this subject the most difficult to study of any part of na∣tural  knowledge and it will easily be granted that the true aera of this science commences with LINNAEUS who very early turned his at∣tention to it and has established that method which has been since universally followed and by which the history of these minuter animals has been greatly extended  The present catalogue contains the description of an hundred rare and mostly undescribed species sent to LINNAEUS from  Carolina Pensylvania Su∣rinam  and  Java  As all these zoological descriptions are supple∣mental to and illustrative of the author's  Systema Naturae  they yet retain their value and cannot be superseded but by a general history of animals on the same plan  LIGNUM QUASSIAE  C M Blom    The  Quassia Amara  Spec Plant p and p or  Bitter Ash  as it is called in the  West In∣dies  is a tree of the decandrous class the root of which was brought into use first at  Surinam  by a negro named  Quassi  who revealed its virtues The medicine was known but the species and true history was long undefined till at length a branch of the tree with the flower and fruit was sent to LINNAEUS from  Surinam  The root is the part used and appears to be the most pure and intense of all bitters At  Surinam  it has acquired a high character in curing the intermitting exa∣cerbating and malignant fevers so endemial to that country and this as the author asserts in  cases where the  Quinquina  has failed It is given in any form but most commonly in an aqueous infusion in the proportion of one drachm to a pint the dose of which is one ounce  The history of this drug is accompanied with a figure of the leaf and parts of fructification Three cases of its good effects from trials made in  Sweden  are inserted and which are not con∣fined to fevers only  There is a confirmation of its virtues in febrile cases from Mr  Farley  of  Antigua  inserted in the  Phil Trans  vol lviii p in circumstances where the Peruvian bark would not stay on the stomach  RAPHANIA  G Rothman    The disease here described is defined in the  Ge∣nera Morborum  of our author to be  a spastic con∣traction of the limbs or joints attended with convulsions and excruciating periodical pains  The author gives a full description of this disease from the two most capital  Swedish  writers on the subject He had seen it himself and observes that it had frequently been epidemical in that country moreover that some physicians had thought it a new distemper He has however traced it in the writings of a numerous set of au∣thors from the year to by which it appears to have been common to other parts of  Europe  This dreadful distemper sometimes held the sick for three or four weeks and those who perished  generally sunk under a diarrhoea or died in con∣vulsions  Valerian Castor Camphor  and Antispas∣modics of the like kind appear to have been the most beneficial remedies  He next brings together in one view the  hypo∣theses  of the various authors relating to the cause of this malady some of whom suppose it owing to a certain constitution of the air others to viti∣ated grain Darnel or the  Secale Cornutum  which were all rejected as unsatisfactory by Dr  E Rosen  one of the last and most intelligent writers on the subject Our author says that in  Sweden  it al∣ways commenced in autumn was frequent only among the lower order of people and consequent upon eating bread made of the new corn Hence he sought for its origin in impure admixtures with the grain and finally his own hypothesis attributes it to the seeds of the  Raphanus Raphanistrum  Sp Plant p or Charlock and hence the name given to the disease The dissertation closes with a figure and botanical description of the plant  The hand of a master is no where more visible than in the scientific manner observed by Dr  Roth∣man  in drawing up the history of this disease and it may be proposed as a model in its kind  GENERA MORBORUM  J Schroder    Of this arrangement of diseases as it stands in LINNAEUS'S own publication made in the year a detailed account hath been given before to which the reader is referred  AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE VOL VII pp  MOTUS POLYCHRESTUS  C Lado    There are few who do not require rather to be reminded than convinced of the many be∣nefits arising from proper exercise Its signal uses both as a preservative and restorer of health are in this dissertation concisely but very strikingly delineated  After some general physiological observations on the effects of exercise the writer displays its efficacy as a  preservative  in strengthening the body procuring the most genial warmth helping digestion increasing perspiration and promoting all the excretions in due time and proportion in procuring the most refreshing sleep and in vale∣tudinary habits particularly subduing that fruit∣ful source of disease acidities in the first pas∣sages  He then enumerates those diseases in which ex∣ercise is to be considered in a  medicinal  view In hypochondriac cases habitual debility languid appetite obstructions of the viscera consumptions asthma and in various diseases from laxity its use has been indispensable  In speaking of the  Hemicrania  he relates that LINNAEUS himself had been subject to violent pa∣roxysms of that kind which usually held him hours with intervals rarely of little more than a week and that these fits were excited by very slight causes even such as the drinking only a spoonful of wine and that after trying ineffectually various  remedies the professor attributed the restoration of his health to the use of daily morning exercise after drinking a large draught of pure water A case is also related of one who from his infancy to his th year had never been free from  Ascarides  but he entirely got rid of them by taking a journey on horseback as far as  Tornoa  in  Lapland  HORTUS CULINARIS  J C Tengborg    Exhibiting a view of all those vegetables which are or which the author thinks might advantage∣ously be cultivated in the fields and gardens of  Sweden  and describing in a succinct way the manner of propagating the several kinds of grain hops tobacco saffron kitchen or boiling herbs sallads potherbs fruittrees and shrubs and finally plants for ornament their proper soil and the methods of guarding them against the seve∣rity of the climate  HIRUDO MEDICINALIS  D Weser    There are nine species of Leeches described in the  Systema Naturae  p That used for me∣dicinal purposes is distinguished under the name of  Hirudo Medicinalis depressa nigricans supra li∣neis flavis sex intermediis nigroarcuatis subtus cinerea nigromaculata  The anatomical structure and natural history of this worm the opinion of the antients relating to it the proper time of pro∣curing it the method of preserving and applying it are all discussed After this the author points out those diseases in which the mode of bloodletting  by means of Leeches hath been preferred to others previous to this however he quotes  Zacutus Lusi∣tanus  for a case where the Leech during its ap∣plication made its way into the  Rectum  and takes occasion to recommend in any similar instance the immediate injection of salt water and thinks it would be equally efficacious in the stomach if the animal has unwarily been swallowed which has sometimes fatally happened  OPOBALSAMUM DECLARATUM  W Le Moine    Among several articles of the  Materia Medica  of the production of which physicians had a very imperfect knowledge none excited more curiosity than this drug called also  Balm of Gilead  and  Bal∣sam of Mecca  from the place of its growth a drug the virtues of which were highly extolled through∣out all the East from the most antient times Near twenty authors are here mentioned who have written professedly on this production but few had seen the shrub that produced it  Prosper Alpinus  says he saw the plant growing in a cultivated state in gardens near  Cairo  but it is now doubt∣ful whether that he saw was the true species though of the same genus We owe the full dis∣covery of the shrub which yields it to Dr  Forskal  one of those unfortunate gentlemen who were sent to  Arabia Felix  on the expedition planned by Pro∣fessor  Michaelis  which did so much honour to the late  Frederick  V of  Denmark  He saw it growing plentifully in that country particularly about  Medina  and transmitted a branch to LINNAEUS in It is now known to be a plant of the  Mo∣nogynous  order in the  Octandrous  class and belongs to the same genus with the plant that in  America  yields the gum  Elemi  It now stands in the Sys∣tem under the name of  Amyris Gileadensis soliis ternatis integerrimis pedunculis unifloris lateralibus  Mant Syst Nat Veg xiii p A com∣plete history of the shrub and the virtues of the balsam are exhibited concerning which we need only observe that modern physicians have found a substitute in other  natural balsams  and therefore do not entertain so high an opinion as the antients did of the wonderful restorative powers of this drug The present age hath made us acquainted with the plants which afford the Gum  Elemi Animae  and  Copaiba  we yet wait for the full discovery of the  Balsam of Peru Ammoniacum Caranna Myrrh Bdellium  and  Sagapenum  This tract closes with a description of the plant which LINNAEUS ho∣noured with the name of  Forskalea  It is figured in  Plukenet  's  Phyt  t f and stands among the  Decandriae Pentagyneae  next to the  Spergula  DIAETA AETATUM  D J Ohrquist    A succinct view of the changes which the hu∣man body passes through in the several stages from the birth to extreme old age inculcating the due observance of all those rules respecting diet and regimen which are best adapted to give vigour to the constitution and permanence of health  during these vicissitudes Pointing out also under each period the disorders incident thereto and laying down proper instructions how best to escape the influence of them  MORBI ARTIFICUM  N Skragge    It is too well known that artificers in various trades are almost necessarily subject to dangerous and sometimes lingering diseases which frequently shorten the period of their lives Miners hewers of freestone workers of metals painters and various others are notorious instances of this truth But as our author observes they are not the only sufferers in this way inasmuch as a too close application to any business or profession will ever be attended with insalutary effects In this con∣cise view of the diseases of tradesmen the author professes to have made all possible use of  Ra∣mazzini  's work on the subject but he has ex∣tended that author's catalogue and availed him∣self of subsequent observations from various au∣thors and interspersed several of his own In brief by confining his view through the several employments of mankind to the immediate ope∣ration of causes and their effects he has rendered this tract at the same time agreeable instructive and interesting  LEPRA  J Uddman    The distemper here described has been long endemial in  Norway  and in several parts of  Sweden  particularly on the eastern coast of the  Bothnian  Gulph and in  Finland  also in the islands of  Oeland  and  Gothland  So long since as the year a pest∣house was erected in the parish of  Croneby  for the reception of the sick of that neighbourhood Our author defines the  Lepra  from LINNAEUS'S  Genera Morborum  as "a distemper shewing itself in pustules throwing off dry scales or scurf at∣tended with moveable discoloured nodes in the flesh and  rhagades  or dry fissures on the skin" N  o  Whether the distemper he undertakes to give the history of be the same with the  Lepra Arabum  or  Alexandrina  the  Javanensis  and the  Americana  of all which he has given the charac∣ters he does not absolutely determine as he inclines to think it a disease various in its appearance Being a native of  Bothnia  he had frequent opportunities of inspecting it and describes it under the follow∣ing appearances in that country  It shewed itself in  tubercles  or nodes fixed in the fleshy parts in the forehead cheeks arms hands and thighs these were indolent moveable with the finger and of a livid hue There were also tubercles of a livid or sometimes brown∣ishyellow cast in the mouth palate fauces and about the root of the tongue  ulcers  in the nos∣trils  tumours  or thickenings of the edges of the outer ears  thick lips feet  and  hands  enlarged and inflamed And in some ulcers or rather  fissures  on the skin creeping broad and deep with cal∣lous edges bleeding from slight pressure or hand∣ling but destitute of pain as were all the  nodes  and  tubercles  as far as the author ever observed  but he says they were inclined to itch round their bases  We cannot pursue our author through his en∣quiries into all the hypotheses relating to the cause of this disorder howsoever ingenious it must suf∣fice to observe that he favours the theory of  Exan∣thematic Animalcula  and from the frequency of this disorder on the seacoast where the inhabitants live much upon fish and particularly herrings which abound with the  Gordius Marinus  Syst or Sea Hairworm adduces a train of argu∣ments to shew that this distemper probably origi∣nates from these worms  In the cure he descants upon the  viperbroth  of the antients and remarks that the famed viper of the East is a different serpent from ours He next treats on the inefficacy of mercurials as vermifuges and quotes Dr  Scopoli  as observing that no people are more troubled with worms than those that work in the quicksilvermines of  Car∣niola  At length against this obstinate and for∣midable malady Dr  Uddman  informs us that Dr  Russel  's method of cure which consists in giv∣ing large quantities of seawater assisted by the other part of the process to which were joined frictions with warm and acrid oils had been at∣tended with more success than any other  FUNDAMENTA ORNITHOLOGICA  A P Back∣man    To all lovers of Ornithology this must have been an acceptable morsel as containing the rudi∣ments  of the science according to the  Linnaean  method and a full explanation of the terms therein employed It is divided into four parts In the first the author gives a brief history of Ornitho∣logists amongst whom he places  Belon  and  Gesner  as the first authors worth attention descending to  Aldrovandus Marcgrave  WILLOUGHBY and RAY before any thing like system was introduced To these succeed  Rudbeck  whose collection of paint∣ings yet unpublished are in the hands of M  de Geer Albin Catesby  and  Edwards  the last of whom from his unwearied diligence and the op∣portunities that his situation at  London  afforded him had excelled all others To these must be added M  Brisson  's publication of  Reaumur  's col∣lection as also  Klein Brunniche  and  Barrere  In the second part the anatomical structure and external form of this order of animals are described First the form in general then the particular parts explaining under each the terms used in describing them and in forming the  generical  and  specific characters  This part is illustrated with a plate which has been copied into several succeed∣ing works on this subject  The third treats on the history of birds re∣specting their habitations migrations incubation and the whole of their natural economy To which is subjoined the method of constructing scientific descriptions and generical characters  The fourth exhibits a general view of the use of birds in the police of nature in diet and their utility to man and here we cannot but note the  Chavaria  of  Jacquin  a species of the  Parra  Syst p which is trained by the  Indians  in the neighbour∣hood of  Carthagena  who breed large flocks of poultry that stray in the woods to defend them against the numerous birds of prey no one of which will dare to encounter this bird It is never known to desert the flock and returns every even∣ing to roost Our author touches on the prog∣nostics of birds in presaging weather so well un∣derstood by seamen and finally as beautiful and pleasurable objects to man  FUNDAMENTA ENTOMOLOGIAE  A J Bladh    The knowledge of insects may be said to be the last branch of natural history that raised its head notwithstanding which it has of late attained a high degree of perfection nor can it be too much to attribute this to the excellent arrangement of LINNAEUS under whose auspices it has extended it∣self beyond all other parts of zoology  The plan of this paper is exactly that of the foregoing and will amply satisfy those who wish to enter on the study of insects In his first chap∣ter Mr  Bladh  gives a chronological list of writers on the subject beginning with  Mouffet  who published in and ending with  Schaeffer  in But the substance of this dissertation has been translated and published in  English  by Mr  Curtis  so that any further account of this work is now superseded  FUNDAMENTA AGROSTOGRAPHIAE  H Gahn    M  Gahn  professes to have undertaken this tract partly with a view to aid the good designs of those  societies  which to the honour of their founders have been established in several parts of  Europe  for the advancement of agriculture with which the subject of this paper is intimately connected  In this large natural class of plants called  Gra∣mina  are comprehended also the  Cerealia  or Grain and including all that are hitherto known do not amount in the System of our author to fewer than species in that of others to many more Such a number of plants so nearly alike in their habit as these must require numerous subdivi∣sions and nice distinctions to discriminate each species To effect this is the intention of this tract in which after some curious preliminary observations relating to the station and uses that nature seems to have assigned to some particular species and a list of the common grasses classed according to their native places the author pre∣sents us with an historical account of the prin∣cipal writers who have treated separately on this class exhibiting under each a brief view of their systems of classification These are  C Bauhine Rudbeck Ray  and above all  Scheuchzer  who with incredible labour has described all the spe∣cies To these might be added several other writers who have also illustrated this branch of botany particularly  Morison  and  Haller  Then follows the description of the natural character  and habit of a plant of this class intended to con∣vey a full explanation of the  terms  referring to two explanatory plates on which is engraven a flower of each genus  Various have been the methods invented to class this tribe our author here gives them a new dis∣position entirely independent on the sexual system established on the  figure  and  number  of the valves composing the Glume or  Calix  and those of the  flower  classed under two general heads as they grow either in the form of  Spikes  or  Panicles  In all  natural classes  the distinctions of the genera depend on minute differences which require very nice discriminations the author therefore proceeds to point these out in several instances of this tribe he has also added the  exceptions  that arise under the several genera in various species an imperfection that attends all systems He concludes with a full explanation of his tables which are better adapted to convey to a learner a true idea of this class than any that we are yet acquainted with since  Schreber  's tables are not adapted to common use in  England  VARIETAS CIBORUM  A F Wedenberg    The immense variety in food which custom necessity and luxury have introduced is here in a concise way displayed the simplicity of some nations whether arising from penury or from cli∣mate the  Apician  luxury of others and the vari∣ous effects of the culinary art are also briefly pointed out then follows a division of aliments into classes thus  Watery  Dry  Pinguious  Styptic  Acid  Bitter  Viscous  Salt  Sweet  Acrid  Under each are subjoined summary observations relating to the effects of a regimen in which any of these classes form the prevailing part and to its tendency in producing particular diseases The author then speaks on the great power of custom on the habit and concludes with inculcating the  Ne quid nimis  an axiom of much higher impor∣tance than any of those nice discriminations relating to the  wholesome  and  unwholesome  which so often perplex the minds and disturb the peace of many wellmeaning people  FERVIDORUM  et  GELIDORUM USUS  C Ribe    Dr  Ribe  fixes the heat of the human body be∣tween and of the  Celsian  thermometer and pronounces all  foods  and  drinks  which arise to to be  fervid  He considers the constant and daily use of hot aliments as an abuse that calls for the strictest animadversion and shews by the effects of them on the solids of the human body their tendency to produce a variety of chronical diseases which he here specifies Man is the only animal accustomed to hot foods and is almost alone affected with carious teeth Hence he takes occasion to condemn in a forcible manner the cus∣tom of drinking hot tea coffee and chocolate and  dissuade his countrymen from the practice of eat∣ing hot bread boiled rice puddings and other like foods to which perhaps from the severity of the climate the  Swedes  are more addicted than some other nations He does not however con∣clude this part without pointing out those cases where  tepid  and even  fervid  liquors are both al∣lowable and beneficial such are some fevers seve∣ral of the spasmodic diseases and those resulting from rigidity of the fibres  In the second part the author reprobates the use of  iced creams jellies  and  drinks  and dissuades especially from a sort of food unknown among us though frequent in  Sweden  this is  congealed oysters  The pernicious quality of these he endea∣vours to prove by several cases He is also not less decisive in condemning a kind of  iced  malt∣liquor drunk in  Sweden  in the summer months Observations on the diseases occasioned by the abuses of all these and a recital of the advantages of simply  cool  liquors conclude this dissertation  POTUS THEAE  P C Tillaeus    At the time of its publication this treatise had perhaps the merit of being the most complete his∣tory of this shrub occasioned by the lucky inci∣dent of its arriving safe in a vegetating state in  Sweden  through the care and skill of Capt  Ekeberg  who is said to be the first that succeeded in the several attempts that had been made to introduce it into  Europe  LINNAEUS had suggested the put∣ting the seeds into earth just as the ship left  China  and the success confirmed the propriety of his method  Tea  is now known to be the leaves of a plant of the  monogynous  order belonging to the  polyandrous  class the flower of which is succeeded by a  tricoc∣cous Capsule  The writer describes the shrub at large gives all the synonyms and mentions those authors who have given figures of it among these  Kaempfer  's is the only exact one It was long be∣lieved that there was but one species but the  Green Tea  is now said to be the produce of another which differs from the  Bohea  in having nine pe∣tals in the flower whereas the Bohea hath but six It is not known to grow spontaneously else∣where than in  Japan  and  China  in which latter kingdom it is cultivated in all the provinces from  Canton  to  Pekin  Mr  Tilley  delivers the mode of preparing the leaves of which we have a diffuse and most exact account by  Kaempfer  who having resided two years in  Japan  was enabled to give the most com∣plete information The origin of the use of  Tea  in those countries is too remote to be ascertained and commerce has now extended its use to almost every corner of the globe The high price of  Tea  at its first introduction induced many physicians to think of a substitute and it is well known that  Simon Pauli  thought the  Myrica Gale  Sp Pl p to be the shrub itself Other  succedanea  are men∣tioned also by our author such as the leaves of the  Prunus spinosa  Sp Pl Sloe Tree  Origanum vulgare  Sp Pl Wild Marjorum  Rubus arcticus  Sp Pl Arctic Bramble  Veronica officinalis  Sp Pl Male Speedwell  Veronica Chamaedrys  Sp Pl Wild Germander  Chenopodium Ambrosioides  Sp Pl Mexican sweet Blite  Capraria biflora  Sp Pl Sweetweed or Goatweed  To this part of our author's treatise may be ad∣ded the wellknown sophistication of Tea prac∣tised by the smugglers in some of the southern parts of this kingdom who have reduced to a regular process the management of the leaves of the  Ash  and  Elder  particularly which when pre∣pared is called  Smouch  and mixed as is said in the proportion of one third with the ordinary  Teas  To what an extent the trade in this sophisti∣cated Tea had been carried to the detriment of the trees may be imagined when the reader is informed that an act of parliament has lately been obtained to prohibit it under very severe penal∣ties But to return to our author  He next considers the sensible qualities of  Tea  its fragrant odour and styptic taste and from its place in the System botanically considered with respect to the  natural orders  he thinks it highly probable that what  Kaempfer  relates of its  narcotic  quality when green is consonant to truth And from similar instances he proves that this quality may readily be thrown off by that degree of heat which the sudden exsiccation of the leaves require  In discussing the virtues of Tea he observes that the  Chinese  recommend the use of it in all lethargic  diseases but condemn it in ophthalmies colics and palsies From  Kalm  he tells us the  Indians  of  North America  knew not the inconveniences of carious teeth debilitated stomachs nor the wo∣men difficult labours until the introduction of Tea among them That the physicians at  Ham∣burgh Amsterdam  c attribute the frequency of the  Leucorrhaea  among the women of condition to their indulgence in this liquor And further that  Boerhaave  ascribed to the sipping hot Tea a schirrosity in the glands of the oesophagus which he met with on dissection and which he thought a disease not known to the antients  The author subjoins some observations on the important and extensive influence of Tea in a mer∣cantile view and as an article of luxury and concludes with the history of the introduction of the living plant into  Europe  as above mentioned hinting also at the possibility of naturalizing it in other countries A plate of the  Bohea Tea  shrub is annexed  POTUS CHOCOLATAE  A Hoffman    We are now come to the last and what our au∣thor thinks the most salubrious of the three ele∣gant articles of luxury that the moderns have ac∣quired by the discovery of the  East  and  West Indies  Chocolate is the produce of an  American  intertro∣pical tree flowering twice in a year and singular in producing its fruit from the body or trunk and not from the branches It belongs to the  Pentan∣drous  order of the  Polyadelphous  class and is dis∣tinguished by the name of  Theobroma Cacao foliis integerrimis  Sp Pl  We are presented with three methods of prepar∣ing Chocolate as practised by the  Indians  by the  Spaniards  and by others as follow The  Indians  to one pound of the roasted nuts put half a pound of sugar dissolved in rosewater and half a pound of flour of Mays or  Indian  corn The  Spaniards  to six pounds of the nut add three and an half of sugar seven pods of vanillas one pound and an half of flour of  Indian  corn half a pound of cinna∣mon six cloves one drachm of capsicum and whatsoever is thought requisite of the roucounut to improve the colour together with amber∣grease or musk to impart an agreeable scent In  the other  and more common way to seventeen pounds of nuts are added ten pounds of sugar twentyeight pods of vanillas one drachm of am∣bergrease and six ounces of cinnamon  The  Vanillas  are the pods silled with minute seeds from a parasitical climbing plant described under the name of  Epidendrum Vanilla  Sp Pl belonging to the  Gynandrous  class with the  Orchides  and like them reputed an aphrodisiac Spices are added to give pungency and mitigate the oleaginous quality of the nut  Having detailed the history of the  nut  the au∣thor considers Chocolate as an  aliment  and in a  medicinal  view He recommends it in  emaciating  diseases both as aliment and medicine and next very strenuously in  hypochondriacal  cases and in confirmation adduces that of Cardinal  Richelieu  who he says was restored to health by living on Chocolate He is not less copious on its good effects against the  Hemorrhoids  in aid of which he  relates a singular case communicated to him by the President himself  SPIRITUS FRUMENTI  P Bergius    The  Arabians  have the credit of inventing the alembic and the distillation of ardent spirits which they are said to have used principally if not at first entirely as solvents only to extract the vir∣tues of simples and exhibit them in the form of tinctures Our author observes from  Raymond Lilly  that they were unknown in  Europe  at the commencement of the th century but the dis∣tillation of  spirit from fermented grain  is attributed to  Arnoldus de Villa Nova  about the year Soon after this time  Brandy  was made in  Sicily  first from spoiled grapes and very early became an article of great commerce at  Venice  Having enumerated the properties of this in∣flammable fluid from  Boerhaave  's chemistry and described a method of preparing the grain for dis∣tillation as practised in  Sweden  which is different from ours the author discusses the salutary effects of  Spirits  medicinally taken as analeptic diuretic cordial and stomachic under all which heads he lays down apposite rules for their use Diluted with coffee he recommends brandy as a diuretic in calculous cases He much prefers it to wine as a preservative against contagious dysenteries and asserts that this was clearly proved among the seamen of the  Swedish  fleet in the expedition of He then considers the imprudent use of it and from its power in  coagulating the fluids  and  indu∣rating  the solids  deduces its effects in producing in∣flammatory fevers consumptions dropsy jaundice hemorrhoids tremors phrensy c and concludes with some welldigested observations on the general abuse of fermented liquors and upon their influence on society both in a political and moral view  MENTHAE USUS  C G Laurin    Mint  is one of those vegetables which have re∣tained their character in medicine from the earliest ages it having been used by the  Greeks  and  Romans England  above all other countries abounds with plants of this genus of which there are not less than eleven species mentioned by the  English  bo∣tanists as indigenous the  Pulegium  which is a true species of Mint being included  In the  natural orders  of botany  Mint  is among the  verticillated  plants which are in general sup∣posed to have  resolvent  and  nervine  qualities and from these powers arise the good effects usually ascribed to this plant in a variety of disorders here particularly specified  PURGANTIA INDIGENA  P Strandman    After some preliminary observations relating to the opinions of the  empirical  and  dogmatic  sects in medicine as connected with his subject and some encomiums on the institution of hospitals as af∣fording a field of observation and experiment to the physician which private practice does not allow the writer presents us with a catalogue of  such vegetables as are endued with a purgative quality confining his tract to such as are either indigenous or easily cultivated in the gardens of  Sweden  Under each he mentions the place of growth the part used its preparation the dose the effects and the disorders in which it has prin∣cipally been employed as a purgative We sub∣join a summary catalogue    Rhamnus Frangula

made between the  cortical  and  medullary  or in other words the  vascular  and  nervous  systems of the human body The present dissertation is a comment on the first part of the  Clavis  relating to the diseases of the vascular system Dr  Bergman  traces the immediate effects both upon the solids and fluids of any excess or defect in the  Air Nourishment Motion  and  Rest Sleep  and  Watch∣ing Excretions  and  Retentions  The  Passions  as be∣ing more immediately connected with the  medullary  or nervous system do not belong to his scheme Having discussed the ill consequences of these errors to the constitution and remarked the dis∣eases originating from thence he turns to the con∣sideration of the old canon "that diseases are cured by their contraries" and agreeably to the theory of his master that such as spring from these errors are principally the objects of dietetic medicine and are to be cured by  Sapids  he pro∣duces the several classes of  Aquosa Sicca Acida Amara Pinguia Styptica Dulcia Acria Mucosa Salsa  and shews their power in preventing and curing diseases concluding his tract with the distinction between the rational and empirical phy∣sician  In mentioning the scurvy and the effects of salted meat he relates a memorable instance of  an arthritic patient who after taking in one summer boles of Mrs  Stephens  's medicine became in the highest degree afflicted with the genuine scurvy which he thinks might fairly be attributed to the quantity of alkaline salt contain∣ed in that medicine  USUS MUSCORUM  A H Berlin    The uses of this class of vegetables in wellcul∣tivated countries and in benign climates can be but little known in the northern regions they are conspicuous The writer after having mentioned those botanists who have particularly attended to this class and given due praise to the matchless work of  Dillenius  on the subject displays the particular advantages of mosses in the general economy of nature for instance the  terrestrial Liverworts  lay the first foundation of soil on barren rocks as the  Sphagnum  and many other  bog mosses  do in marshy and boggy places In human economy nothing is more remarkable than the utility of the  reindeer moss  in the arctic regions Many of the liver∣worts are ingredients in dyeing and several mosses have their place in medicine among which parti∣cularly may be mentioned the  Lichen Islandicus  Sp Pl Iceland or Eryngoleaved Liver∣wort of the virtues of which in consumptions Dr  Scopoli  has written a distinct treatise published in the  Annus    dus  Historiconaturalis  Lips  The reader will find a paper written by the au∣thor of this volume on the uses of this  order  of  plants in the  Philosophical Transactions  for the year vol l p  MUNDUS INVISIBILIS  J C Roos    The subjects of this thesis have been much agi∣tated of late years by the philosophical  literati  who have been skilled in the use of microscopes It turns principally on the discoveries of the Baron  Munkhausen  relating to the  smut  of wheat and bar∣ley and to the dust of the  Lycoperda  or Puffballs  Agarics  and other  Fungi  which he has asserted to be no other than the  ova  of  animalcula  from whence had arisen a doubt whether mushrooms should be ranked with vegetables or animals LINNAEUS adopted though with great hesitation the Baron's opinion as appears from his  Systema Nat  p but his sentiments on this subject after the experiments made by our late Mr  Ellis  who at his request instituted a course professedly to determine this point do not appear The re∣sult of Mr  Ellis  's enquiry proved the negative as may be seen by his papers published in the  Phil Trans  vol lix p and  Gent Magazine  for p Much curious matter on this sub∣ject occurs in Mr  Roos  's paper but we conclude with an important fact related from the Baron's book who recommends the seed wheat to be washed in a lye made of lime and seasalt by which prac∣tice for twenty years he had secured his crop from smut although his neighbours around him had sometimes lost a third part of theirs In the lat∣ter  part of the thesis the author descants on  ex∣anthematic animalcula  and appears to favour that hypothesis candidly confessing however the dif∣ficulties that occur and concluding with a string of doubts proposed by way of queries relating to this abstruse point  USUS HISTORIAE NATURALIS  M Aphonin    This ingenious discourse written by a young  Russian  nobleman a student at  Upsal  is one of the most entertaining and bestdigested papers on the subject that this collection affords and cannot fail to carry conviction with it It is divided into two parts in the first he displays the necessity of a knowledge of natural history at large in leading the way to improvements in all branches of agriculture and in gardening the utility espe∣cially of being acquainted with the indigenous plants of the country an object greatly neglected and which if more attended to must lead as he endeavours to shew to the improvement of woods hedges the culture of barren ground wet mea∣dows to the extirpation of hurtful plants and the better adapting pastures to the several kinds of cattle To illustrate this latter position he mentions a memorable fact related by LINNAEUS in the  Iter Scanicum  of a number of goats which were perishing in an island that abounded with the Reed Bent Grass  Agrostis arundinacea  a plant on which horses feed with avidity and thrive  greatly Thus also on the other hand goats will riot and fatten on the Meadow Sweet  Fili∣pendula Ulmaria  whilst horses and horned cattle especially when they are young will not touch it  The second part abounds with curious observa∣tions concerning the economy of domesticated ani∣mals in treating on which he points out both the most nutritive and noxious herbs to each species descending afterwards to domestic fowls and the inferior parts of the animal creation which are more particularly the objects of husbandmen A plate is added on which is engraven together with a rare species of  Henbane  the  Actaea Cimici∣fuga  Sp Pl famous in  Russia  and  Tartary  beyond all other things for expelling bugs and some other noxious insects  NECESSITAS HISTORIAE NATURALIS ROSSIAE  A De Karamyschew    This paper is also written by a  Russian  noble∣man and is intended to excite his countrymen to a diligent cultivation of the study of natural his∣tory as a science eminently beneficial to a rising people To this purpose he endeavours to raise their emulation by shewing the progress it has made in the eastern nations of  Europe  displaying its beneficial influences and by exhibiting the vast field which the empire of  Russia  affords He then gives some biographical anecdotes of those who have improved the natural history of that country under the patronage and command of their sovereigns from the time of  Peter  the First  Such were  Messerchmidius Buxbaum Gmelin  the last of whom sojourned in  Siberia  from to  Krascheninnikow Martin Steller Amman  and others He then recites from the  Museum Petropolitanum  a list of zoological subjects for further investigation which although natives of  Russia  and  Siberia  are yet very imperfectly known He endeavours to persuade his countrymen to the culture of a number of useful vegetables by pre∣senting them with a long catalogue of exotics that have been in some sort naturalized at  Abo  in  Fin∣land  under the care of Professor  Kalm  His tract concludes with a list of plants which are natives of  Siberia  extracted from the MSS of  Heinzellmann Gerber Lerche  and  Schober  all which MSS were in the hands of LINNAEUS A figure of a specious  Siberian  plant accompanies this tract It is the  Fumaria Spectabilis  Sp Pl p  RARIORA NORWEGIAE  H Tonning    The pen of a learned ingenious and skilful naturalist is visible in this agreeable specimen of natural history The writer first traces the origin of the science among the  Danes  whose monarchs have lately been its celebrated patrons Among the principal modern writers stands  Gunner  the late Bishop of  Dronthem  who to the highest merit in his sacred profession also added an exquisite taste for natural history and a consummate know∣ledge in that science as his writings fully testify Neither is Mr  J Strom  forgotten who published in a natural history of  Sondmore  in the diocese  of  Bergen  After this literary introduction the principal intention of the writer is to exhibit lists of the more rare subjects of nature especially such as are not common in  Sweden  Agreeably to this design we have a catalogue of the peculiar plants of  Norway  the alpine some other rare species and particularly of the  Fuci  or Sea Wracks with which the coast of  Norway  abounds Also a list from the  Dronthem Act tom  II of all the  American  fruits which are thrown on the  Norway  shore every year and which have raised much speculation among the curious to account for their transmis∣sion so particularly to that part of  Europe  The author asks the solution of this difficulty from the learned inasmuch as they are sometimes found in no inconsiderable quantity and so recent as to germinate upon being properly secured from the climate These fruits are usually the  Cassia Fistula Anacardium  or Cushew Nuts  Cucurbitae Lagenariae▪  Bottle Gourds Pods of the  Mimosa Scandens  Sp Pl p called  Cocoons  in the  West Indies  Pods of the  Piscidia Erythrina  called Dogwood Tree by  Sloane  and Coconuts  The author next pursues his catalogue through all the classes of animals using only the  Linnaean  trivial names and referring to the  Fauna Suecica  to  Gunner  and to  Strom  It may be observed that the latter writer thinks that what deceived the fishermen and by their means Bishop  Pontoppidan  under the appearance of a serpent of the extraordinary length described in his  History of Norway  was no other than a string of sturgeon which at the stated time of the year follow each other in a line in immense  numbers with only their backs above water which might suggest the idea of the waving motion of a serpent  The remaining part of the tract chiefly respects the medicinal plants and the diseases of the coun∣try An account of some vegetable productions which form an article of commerce being exported in considerable quantities among which are reck∣oned the Cloudberry  Rubus Chamaemorus  Sp Pl and the  Lichen Islandicus  mentioned in the account of the  Usus Muscorum  N  o  Then follows a list of medicines easily obtained or such as are in use among the country people Among these the good effects of the  Linnaea borealis  Sp Pl in rheumatic disorders are well known and much celebrated He relates on the authority of the President himself that two men who had been confined to their bed for several months by ischiatic pains were cured in three days by a strong decoction of it Its operation appears to have been of the sedative kind since the patients were thrown into a sleep which lasted sixteen or twenty hours He confirms the opinion of the  Lepra  arising from the  Hair Worm  as mentioned in N  o  of this collection and has some obser∣vations relating to the  Colica Lapponum  described in M  Montin  's thesis N  o  The dissertation closes with the description of an  African  plant called by LINNAEUS  Gunnera  in honour of the Bishop of  Dronthem  ITER  in  CHINAM  A Sparrman    We presume this is the same person who af∣terwards made the voyage round the world with Dr  Forster  in Capt  Cook  's ship and has since travelled over a large tract of country in southern  Africa  in pursuit of those gratifications which his zeal for natural history enabled him to enjoy The present voyage which was begun  Dec  and finished  July  was made with Capt  Ekeberg  who has been mentioned as having first introduced the  tea  shrub into  Sweden  This epi∣tome of the voyage consists of little more than an enumeration of those subjects of natural history which occurred to the journalist both at land and at sea for as he makes use of the  trivial  names all descriptions are superseded except that in the notes some of those imperfectly known are more amply detailed  OBSERVATIONS tending to shew the Utility of botanical Knowledge in Relation to Agriculture and the feeding of Cattle accom∣panied with a Translation of LINNAEUS'S  Pan Suecus  accommodated to the  English  Plants with references to Authors and to Figures of the Plants  THE science of botany certainly holds its most dignified station when subservient to  medicine  but its utility does not terminate in this alone though it has too long been considered as having no other connection This notwithstand∣ing is but a partial nay even an injurious idea of it for nothing has more retarded its usefulness than this contracted notion It has a relation in a variety of ways to many other arts and sciences Among which may be mentioned the  art of paint∣ing and dying  but of all others  Agriculture  cer∣tainly claims the strictest relation some of its most important branches being greatly dependent upon it and others from an happy application of it being perhaps capable of further emolument The subsequent paper it is presumed will in some measure illustrate this truth But howsoever great the real dignity and importance of this art yet it must be allowed that it has not been cultivated sufficiently on scientific principles nor advanced in equal proportion with other branches of know∣ledge It is not many years since Dr  Home  ob∣served  that  Virgil  and  Columella  old as they are remained almost the only writers worth con∣sulting upon this subject The writings of Mr  Hart  Dr  A Hunter  Lord  Kaims  Mr  Young  and of many others since published in our own nation we hope have superseded Dr  Home  's remark and from that laudable spirit now diffusing among us throughout  Great Britain  for the improvement of  Arts  and  Sciences  under the protection of our pub∣lic institutions we may expect to see every branch of agriculture studied as it deserves and attended with that success which commonly results from the right application of knowledge to the pur∣poses of human life On the continent the  Swedes  are making large and daily progress in the im∣provement of this branch of  economics  In  France  Mr  Du Hamel  has rendered himself conspicuous by his writings on this subject and in various parts of  Europe  societies have been formed with a professed view to this end We cannot help mentioning with peculiar pleasure that of  Padua  over which Dr  Arduin  presides who by the mu∣nificence of the  Venetian  state has a garden allotted for the cultivation of such vegetables as they wish to subject to experiments in agriculture dyeing and other arts A noble institution and worthy of imitation  Amidst that almost infinite variety of vegetables with which the beneficent hand of nature has re∣plenished our earth those which go under the general name of  Grasses  form the principal food of our cattle next to these among the  natural classes  of plants none are more acceptable than the  diadelphous  or leguminous herbs of this class is the  Clover  so much cultivated in  England  the  Saint Foin  or  Cockshead  and the  Lucern  or Medic∣fodder in  France  Besides these our horses horned cattle sheep c will all in their turn eat with equal pleasure and some with more avi∣dity a great variety of other vegetables Nume∣rous instances occur where one species of animals will feed greedily upon those herbs which others refuse to touch and will even almost famish rather than eat Some plants are highly noxious and even poisonous to certain kinds of animals while they are eaten by others without the least subsequent ill effect to instance the  Cicuta Virosa  or long∣leaved Water Hemlock the most virulent plant which grows spontaneously in  England  but hap∣pily is not common is fatal to cows when through scarcity of food they are obliged to eat it yet sheep and horses feed on it with impunity and goats even greedily devour it  Videre licet pinguescere saepe  Cicutâ  Barbigeras pecudes homini quae est acre venenum  LUCR  Facts of this kind must in some measure have been obvious to the most incurious of mankind even in the earliest ages The first race of shep∣herds had daily instances among their flocks of the selection and refusal of particular herbs and subsequent observations must have multiplied and confirmed them But they were still only known in the general and no  experiments  had been insti∣tuted to ascertain the  precise species  thus eaten or  rejected The facts are at this time undeniable It is well known that  Flagflowers Houndstongue Henbane Mullein Nightshade Hemlock  several  Docks Arsmart Agrimony Celandine  several  Crowfoots Marsh Marigold Horehound Figwort  many  Thistles Fern  and other plants are commonly neglected by our horses and horned cattle and stand un∣touched even in pastures where it might be ex∣pected that necessity should constrain them to eat any thing These are but a few out of many in∣stances there are more than is commonly imagin∣ed and it was desirable in consequence of these observations that a course of experiments should be instituted to elucidate this instinct in that part especially of the brute creation which is so imme∣diately subservient to mankind The utility of such experiments must be evident as they must necessarily lay the foundation of farther improve∣ments in the economy of cattle The intelligent husbandman would by this means have it in his power to rid his pastures of noxious and useless plants and give room for the salubrious ones  In this view of the affair it will be seen that physicians are not the only persons who may study botany to advantage many others would find not only a fund of pleasure from this study but numberless other advantages resulting from the knowledge of the plants of their own country In the instance before us science has opened the way and surely it is not too much to say that it evi∣dently points to greater improvements in one of the most important branches of agriculture as it relates to the economy of cattle More than this  ought not to be expected from its aid It is to the intelligent grazier and the gentleman well versed in the knowledge of the  indigenous  plants fraught with careful observation and practised in the eco∣nomy of cattle that the rest must be owing No∣thing but the want of this knowledge in such gentlemen as reside in the country chiefly can de∣prive us of the benefit which might otherwise ac∣crue from reducing it into practice The eradi∣cating from pastures poisonous and useless weeds would be but one although indeed no mean one among many other advantages Further than this the husbandman would be better enabled to suit his several sorts of cattle to the different pas∣tures in his possession more to their benefit and consequently his own Even in marshy grounds where it is a difficult undertaking to mend the soil the growth of many plants might be encouraged and the seeds of others sown which are highly acceptable to different kinds of cattle By degrees too we should undoubtedly be led to the cultivation of other vegetables besides  clover  as fodder and the foregoing observations imply that this might be done in soils and situa∣tions where that would not thrive Our hay would in consequence be much improved for al∣though cattle will eat those herbs among hay which they reject while green and growing yet it does not follow that all are in their dried state equally nutritive and wholesome The benefits in fine which would arise from a diligent and general pursuit of these hints would undoubtedly be vari∣ous and extensive and many more in all probabi∣lity  in a course of years than can at present be thought of  Agreeably to these ideas a beginning has been made under the auspices of our celebrated author whose attempt was truly laudable and worthy of himself To this end it is indeed certainly the province of the botanist to make the plants of his own country the principal objects of his atten∣tion This has been eminently the case with LIN∣NAEUS and his country will continue to reap the fruit of his labours The result of these experi∣ments may be seen in a paper called PAN SUECUS printed in the second volume of the  Amoenitates Academicae  the substance of which so far as the experiments were made with plants common to this country will be exhibited in the subsequent pages  LINNAEUS conceived the first design of this in∣stitution from observations made in his  Dalekarlian  journey which has been mentioned in the course of the preceding pages he observed that his horses left untouched among other plants  Mea∣dowsweet Great Wild Valerian Lilly of the Valley Angelica Rosebay Willow Herb Marsh Cinquefoil Mountain Crowfoot Crane'sbill Globe Crowfoot  and various shrubs It was not till several years after that these experiments were instituted in which a number of his pupils were engaged eight or nine of whom he mentions by name and he had himself a large share in directing and conducting them More than two thousand experiments were tried upon the  horned cattle goats sheep horses  and  hogs  many were repeated ten and some twenty  times with the sole view of determining what vegetables these several animals would eat or re∣ject It is easy to see that numberless difficulties must arise in the prosecution of this scheme and that imperfection in a variety of instances must at last attend their greatest accuracy In the mean time care was taken as far as circumstances would admit that the experiments were made as unexceptionably as possible and it must be con∣cluded that the result upon the whole is true as they have a real foundation in those unerring laws of instinct to which nature has subjected the whole brute creation The plants were all fresh gather∣ed not bruised in collecting nor offered to the cattle when they were either almost famished or glutted with variety nor yet in the springtime when many of them greedily devour almost any vegetable they can get sometimes such as are fatal to them and which at other times they will not touch The plants were also in many examples offered to several individuals of the same species  These trials were made only with the indigenous plants of  Sweden  which are at least three fourths the same as ours in  England  The plants growing spontaneously in  Sweden  exclusive of the mosses and funguses amount to about species Of such a number in every country many must be very rare it is not therefore to be expected that all these could be brought to trial Some although plentiful in one part of the country would be very sparingly found in another From the result it appeared that the  horned cattle  eat of the plants which were offered to them▪ only species and  that they rejected The  goats  of kinds refusing The  sheep  of refusing The  horses  of species refusing And of those which were offered to  swine  they eat kinds and refused  The  Pa  Suecus  it may be presumed is but in few hands at least of such whom the subject most concerns It is written in Latin and put into the most compendious form imaginable by inserting only the  trivial  names of the plants and referring to the number in the  Flora Suecica  where the sy∣nonyms are given In this form it is almost use∣less to persons unacquainted with LINNAEUS'S writ∣ings and from an  English  reader is entirely hid It appeared of importance enough to be thrown into an  English  dress to which end it was necessary to give it a form different from the original  So far as the trials were made with plants which are common to both countries the result may be seen in the following pages and they amount to no very inconsiderable number Being taken  nearly  in the order in which they stood in the original paper so the sexual system is of course preserved Yet perhaps a more apt disposition of them might have been given by arranging them according to their usual places of growth  In order to render it more generally intelligible and acceptable the  English  name of the plant is first given then the  Linnaean  generical and trivial name by which it may instantly be found either in LINNAEUS'S own works or in Mr  Hud∣son's Flora Anglica  To these follow three columns The first contains the reference to the page in Dr  Hill  's  British Herbal  which it may be presumed is in many hands and which has now superseded in a great measure the  Herbals  of  Gerard  and  Perkinson  being better accommodated to the purposes of bo∣tanic intelligence and furnished also with figures The second column refers to the page in RAY'S  Synopsis of British Plants  where the synonyms of the two  Bauhines  and those of  Gerard  and  Parkinson  are quoted By this means the reader is very compendiously directed to a variety of authors on each plant For the sake of those who wish to see an accurate figure a reference to the  Flora Danica  is added a work coming out at the expence of the King of  Denmark  and intended to contain all the indigenous plants of that kingdom of which plates are already done Of these above are natives of this kingdom on which account it supplies so far the want of a work of the same kind here It must however be observed that in this column under the  Grasses  those excellent tables in  Morison  's  Historia  On this head it is much to be regretted that these tables are not republished separately with the history of the  Grasses  and  Grain  annexed a work which if executed by a proper hand could not but be acceptable to all lovers of rural economy This view might be rendered still more complete by extending it to  all  those plants which are par∣ticularly the objects of this paper  Plantarum Oxoniensis  are referred to The columns on the other page contain the result of the experiments for brevity's sake expressed as in the original by nu∣merical characters which it will be necessary to illustrate There is a column retained for every  species of animals with which the experiments were made in  Sweden  for although  goats  are not so commonly kept with us as in that country yet it will at least be matter of entertainment if not of utility to see what choice of vegetables they will make  When this figure is made use of it denotes that the plant is eaten by that animal to which the column is appropriated  O  horned cattle or  Oxen G Goats Sh Sheep H Horses S Swine  Two units thus denote that the ani∣mal is very fond of the plant When the cypher occurs we are to understand that the plant is rejected by that animal When both are found together in a column thus or they denote that it was sometimes eaten and sometimes rejected the former is supposed to signify that it was generally eaten but sometimes refused the latter the reverse Where no figure occurs it is to be understood that no opportunity had been taken of making a trial of that plant upon those animals The native place of each plant is added and the month in which it flowers in as compen∣dious a manner as possible as this seemed to be a requisite addition also its duration whether an∣nual  A  biennial  B  or perennial  P  To the whole are collected and subjoined from the last edition of the  Flora Suecica  the  Flora Oeconomica  RAY'S  Historia Plantarum  HALLER'S  Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae  and others a few

Tartars  who live a migratory life tending their flocks and herds always in the summertime choose places where this grass abounds on account of its acceptableness especially to the sheep It is found on dry mountainous pastures in most parts of  Europe  and in  England  is common on downs and uplands The superiority of our wool in some parts of  England  may possibly be owing to a particular  ood which the sheep meet with in disferent places and it might be worth enquiry whether this grass may not have a great share in producing this effect In general we know that wool to be the finest which is bred on high pastures but all such pastures are not equal in this respect Until a better reason be assigned for this difference may it not be ascribed to the difference of their food  Sheep's
