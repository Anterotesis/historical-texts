 AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION That No body thinks of  VIZ But what if the QUEEN should die  LONDON  Printed for J BAKER at the  Black Boy  in  Paternoster Row  Price Six Pence  AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION c  THAT we are to have a Peace or That the Peace is made What sort of Peace or How it has been brought about these are Questions the World begins to have done with they have been so much so often and to so little purpose banded about and toss'd like a Shuttlecock from one Party to another the Parties themselves begin to want Breath to rail and throw Scandal  Roper  and  Ridpath  like two  Tom Tmen  have thrown NightDirt at one another so long and grop'd into so many Jakes's up to their Elbows to find it that they stink now in the Nostrils of their own Party They are become perfectly nauseous to read the Nation is surfeited of them and the People begin to be tired  with ill using one another Would any tolerable Face appear upon things we might expect the People would be inclined to be easie and were the Eyes of some Great Men open they may see this was the Opportunity they never had before to make the Nation easie and themselves safe The main thing which agitates the Minds of Men now is the Protestant Succession and the Pretender Much Pains have been taken on both sides to amuse the World about this remaining Dispute one side to make us believe it is safe and the other to convince us it is in Danger Neither side hath been able to expatiate upon the Part they affirm Those who say the Protestant Succession is secure have not yet shewn us any Step taken since these New Transactions for its particular Security Those who say it is in danger have not so clearly determined even among themselves from what particular Head of Publick Management that Danger chiefly proceeds Both these Uncertainties serve to perplex us and to leave the thing more undetermined than consists with the publick Ease of the Peoples Minds To contribute something to that Ease and bring those whose Place it is to consider of Ways to make the People easie in this Case this Work is  made Publick Possibly the Question propounded may not meet with a Categorical Answer But this is certain it shall shew you more Directly what is the chief Question which the substance of Things before us is like to turn upon and to which all our Questions seem to Tend Were the great Difficulty of the Succession brought to a narrow Compass tho' we might spend fewer Words about it we should sooner come to a direct Answer Before I come to the Great and chief Question upon which this Affair so much seems to Turn it seems needful to put the previous Question upon which so much Debate has been among us and let that be Examined This previous Question is this Is there any real Danger of the Protestant Succession Is there any Danger that the Pretender shall be brought in upon us Is there any Danger of Popery and Tyranny by Restoring the Son  as they call him  of Abdicated King  James  This is the previous Question as we may now call it It is well known that there are some People among us who are so far from allowing that there is any such Danger as the said Question mentions that they will have it be a Token of Disaffection to the Government to put the Question and are for loading whoever shall  offer to Start such a Question with Characters and PatryMarks odious to good Men such as Incendiary Promoter of Discontents Raiser of Faction Divider of the People and the like Names which the Writer of these Sheets at the same time both contemns and abhors He cannot see that he is any Enemy to the Queen in Inquiring as diligently as possible whether there are any Attempts to Depose Her or dangerous Prospects of bringing in the hated Rival of Her Glory and Dominion It is so far from that that it is apparently the Duty of every true Subject of Her Majesty to Inquire seriously whether the publick Peace the Queen's Safety Her Throne or Her Person is in any Danger from the wicked Design of Her and Her Peoples Enemies Wherefore and for the joint Concern every Protestant  Britain  has in this thing I shall make no Difficulty plainly and seriously to State and to Answer this previous Question  viz  Whether there is any Danger of the Protestant Succession from the present Measures and from the present People concern'd I am not ignorant of what has been said by some to prove that the present Ministry cannot be suspected of having any View to the Pretender in any of their Measures The  best Reason which I have seen given upon that Subject is that it is not their Interest and that as we have not found them Fools that are blind to their own Interest that either do not understand or pursue it This we find handled sundry ways by sundry Authors and very much Insisted upon as a Foundation sor us to build upon We shall give our Thoughts upon it with plainness and without Fear or Favour Good Manners requires we should speak of the Ministry with all due regard to their Character and Persons This is a Tract design'd to Inquire seriously of a Weighty and Essential not a trifling Thing which requires but a trifling Examination nor shall it be handled here with Satyr and Scurrility We Approve neither of the Flatteries of one side or the Insultings of the other We shall readily and most willingly Joyn with those who are of Opinion that it is not the Interest of the Ministry to be for the Pretender and that the Ministry are not blind to or careless of their own Interest and Consequently that the Ministry cannot be for the Pretender This I hope may be called a direct Answer When I say  Cannot  I must not be understood potentially that they have no Moral Capacity But they cannot without such Inconsistencies  Contradictions and Improbable things happening in which render it highly Irrational so much us to suppose it of them To shut the Door against any possibility of Cavil It may be needful also to take it with us as we go what we mean by the Words  be for  the Pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a Design however remote and upon whatever Views to bring him in to possess the Throne of these Kingdoms The matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the Question pointblank and think it our Duty to say with the greatest Sincerity that we do not believe the Ministry are in any Kind or with any Prospect near or remote Acting for or with a Design or View to bring in the Pretender Having granted this we must however to prevent any Breaking in by way of Cavil on one Hand or Triumph on the other subjoyn immediately that we do not in the least Grant by this that the Protestant Succession is in no Danger even from several of the Measures now taken in the World It is far from any Reflection upon the Ministry to say that however they may Act upon a right sincere Principle for the Protestant Succession in all they do which as above  we profess to believe Yet that many of the Tools they make use of are of another Make and have no Edge to cut any other way no Thoughts to move them towards any other End no other Center which they can have any Tendency to that the Pretender's Interest is the Magnet which draws them by its secret Influence to point to him as their Pole that they have their Aim at his Establishment here and own it to be their Aim And as they are not Shy to prosess it among themselves so their Conduct in many things makes it sufficiently publick This is not meant as any Reflection upon the Ministry for making use of such Men The late Ministry did the same and every Ministry will and must Employ Men sometimes not as they always Joyn with them in their politic Principles but as either the Men are found useful in their several Employments or as the Ministry may be under other Circumstances which makes it Necessary to them to Employ them Nor as the  Review  well enough observ'd does it follow that  because the Ministry have Employ'd or Joyn'd with  Jacobites  in the publick Affairs that therefore they must have done it with a  Jacobite  Principle  But let the Ministry Employ these Men by what Necessity or upon what  Occasion they will tho' it may not follow that the Ministry are therefore for  the Pretender  yet it does not also follow that there is no Danger of the Protestant Succession from the Employing those sort of People  For what if the Queen should Die  The Ministry it is hoped are Established in the Interest of their Queen and Country and therefore it has been Argued that supposing the Ministry had the Pretender in their Eye yet that it is Irrational to suggest that they can have any such View during the Life of Her present Majesty Nay even those profest  Jacobites  who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of Deposing the Queen who has been so Bountiful so Kind so exceeding Good to them as in several Cases to suffer them to be brought into the Management of Her own Affairs when by their Character they might have been thought Dangerous even to Her Person▪ thus Winning and Engaging them by Her Bounty and the Confidence that has been plac'd in them not to Attempt any thing to Her prejudice without the most Monstrous Ingratitude without flying in the Face of all that Sense of Honnor and Obligation which it is possible for Men of common Sense to entertain  And it can hradly be thought that even Papists themselves under the highest possessions of their Religious Zeal can Conquer the Native Aversions they must have to such abominable Ingratitude or to think of bringing in the Pretender upon this Protestant Nation even while the Queen shall be on the Throne But tho' this may  and some doubt that also  tye up their Hands during the Queen's Life yet they themselves give us but small Reason to expect any thing from them afterward and it will be hard to find any body to Vouch for them then These very  Jacobites Papists  and profest Enemies to the Revolution may be supposed upon these Pretentions to be Quiet and offer no Violence to the present Establishment while Her Majesty has the Possession and while that Life lasts to which they are so much Indebted for Her Royal Goodness and Clemency  But what would they do if the Queen should die  Come we next to the  French King  We are told that not the  French King  only but even the whole  French Nation  are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the Obligation they are under to the Justice and Favour which they have Received from Her Majesty in the putting an End to  the War a War which lay Heavy upon them and Threaten'd the very Name of the  French Nation  with Ruin and much more Threatn'd the Glory of the  French Court  and of their Great Monarch with an entire Overthrow a total Eclipse A War which by their own Confession it was Impossible for them long to have supported the Expences of and which by the great Superiority of the  Allies  became Dreadful to them and that every Campaign more than other a War which they were in such Pain to see the End of that they tried all the Powers and Courts in Christendom who were the least Neutral to Engage a Mediation in order to a Treaty and all in vain and a War which if Her Majesty had not Enclin'd to put an End to must have Ended perhaps to the Disadvantage and Confusion of both  France  and  Spain  if not of all Christendom The Obligations the  French  are under for the bringing this War to so just and Honourable a Conclusion are not at all Concealed Nay the  Freuch  themselves have not been backward to make them publick The Declarations made by the  Freuch King  of his Sincerity in the Overtures made for a General Peace the Protestations of his being resolved to Enter into an entire Confidence and a League  Offensive and Defensive with the Queen's Majesty for the Preservation of the Peace of Christendom his Recognition of Her Majesty's just Right to the Crown his entring into Articles to preserve the Union acknowledging the Ninth Electorate in favour of the House of  Hanover  and joining in the Great Affair of the Protestant Succession As these all convince the World of the Necessity his Affairs were reduced to and the great Advantages accruing to him by a Peace so they seem to be so many Arguments against our Fears of the  French  entring into any Engagements against the Crown of  Britain  much less any against the Possession of the Queen during her Life Not that the Honour and Sincerity of the King of  France  is a Foundation fit for her Majesty or her People to have any Dependance upon and the Fraction of Former Treaties by that Court when the Glory of that Monarch or his particular Views of things has dictated such Opportunity to him as he thought fit to close with are due Cautions to us all not to have any Dependance of that kind But the State of his Affairs and the Condition the War has reduced him to may give us some Ground to think our selves safe on that side He knows  what Power he has taken off from his Enemies in making Peace with Her Majesty he knows very well with what loss he sits down how his Affairs are weaken'd and what need he has to take Breath after so terrible a War besides the Flame such an Action would kindle again in  Europe  how it would Animate this whole  British  Nation against him in such a manner and Endanger bringing in a new War and perhaps a new Confederacy upon him so violently and that before he would be in a Condition to Match them that no one can reasonably suppose the  French  King will run the hazard of it And these things may Tend to make some People easier than ordinary in the Affair of the Succession believing that the  French  King stands in too much need of the Favour of the Queen of  Great Britain  whose Power it well behoves him to keep in Friendship with him and whose Nation he will be very Cautious of provoking a third time as he has already done twice to his fatal Experience All these things we say may seem pretty well to assure us that nothing is to be feared on that side so long as Her Majesty lives to sit upon the  British  Throne But all leaves our Grand Question unanswered and tho' we may Argue strongly for the  French  King's Conduct while the present Reign  continues yet few will say  What he will do if the Queen should die  Nay we may even mention the  Pretender  himself if he has any about him whose Councils are fit to be Depended upon and can Direct him to make a Wise and prudent Judgment of his own Affairs if he Acts by any Scope of Policy and can take his Measures with any foresight most easie it is for them to see that it must be in vain for him to think of making any Attempt in  Britain  during the Life of the Queen or to expect to Despose Her Majesty and set himself up The  French  Power upon which he has already in vain Depended as it has not hitherto been able to serve him or his Father but that their Exile has continued now above Twenty four Years So much less can he be able to Assist him now while he has been brought as it were to Kneel to the  British  Court to put an End for him to this cruel destructive War The Reason is just spoken to  viz  that this would be to rekindle that Flame which he has gotten so lately Quenched and which Cost him so much Art so much Management so much Submission to the  Allies  to Endeavour the Quenching of before To Attack the Queen of  Great Britain  now in behalf of the  Pretender  would not only be in the highest Degree  Ungrateful Perfidious and Dishonourable but would for ever make the  British  Court as well as the whole Nation his Violent and Implacable Enemies but would also Involve him again in a new War with all  Europe  who would very gladly Fall in again with  Britain  to pull down more Effectually the  French  Power which has so long been a Terror to its Neighbours So that the  Pretender  can Expect no Help from the King of  France  As to what the  Pope  the  Spaniard  and a few petty  Popish  Powers who might pretend upon a Religious prospect to Assist him and with whose Aid and the Assistance of his Party here he may think fit to hazard an Attempt here for the Crown it is Evident and his own Friends will agree in it that while the Queen lives it is Nonscence and Ridiculous for them to Attempt it that it would immediately Arm the whole Nation against them as one Man and in Humane probability it would like as his supposed Father was serv'd at the Revolution be the Ruin of his whole Interest and blow him at once quite out of the Nation I believe that there are very few who Alarm themselves much with the Fears of the  Pretender  from the Apprehension of his own strength from Abroad or from his own Party and Friends  at Home here were they once sure that he should receive no Assistance from the King of  France  If then the King of  France  cannot be reasonably supposed either to be Inclin'd or be in a Conditon to Appear for him or Act in his behalf during the Life of the Queen neither can the Pretender  say some  unless he is resolved to Ruin all his Friends and at last to Ruin himself make any Attempt of that Kind during Her Majesty's Life  But what if the Queen should die  Having then View'd the several Points of the Nation's Compass whence our Danger of  Jacobite  Plots and Projects against the Protestant Succession may be expected to come Let us now Enquire a little of the State of the Nation that we make a right Estimate of our Condition and may know what to trust to in Cases of Difficulty as they lye before us In doing this as well to avoid giving offence to the People now in Power as to the Entring into the Quarrels which Engage the present contending Parties in this Divided Nation we shall allow however some may think fit to Question it the main Debate and Grant this for the present as a Fundamental  viz That we are in no Danger  of the Pretender  during this Queen's Reign  or  during this Ministry's Administration  under Her Majesty  and avoiding all Contention of that Kind shall allow our Condition to be  SAFE  in every Article as we go along  for so long as the Queen Lives  referring the Observation of things in every Head to those who can Answer the main Question in our Title  viz But what if the Queen should die  First of all it may be Noticed that the present Safety of this Nation whether we respect Liberty Religion Property or publick Safety and Prosperity Depends upon this one Fundamental  viz  That  alluding reverently to that Text of Scripture  we are all built upon the Foundation of the late Revolution  Establisht Law  and  Right  being the  chief CornerStone  By this it is that Her Majesty is made our Queen the Entail of the Crown being reserv'd in the remainder to Her Majesty in the Act of Settlement made at the filling up the vacant Throne and by all those subsequent Acts which Her Majesty's Title was Confirm'd by during the Life of the Late King  This Revolution  is that upon which the Liberties and Religion of this Nation were Rebuilt after the Conflagration that was made of them in the Calamitous Times of King  Charles  II and King  James  II  and from hence to the Love of Liberty which is found almost to be Naturally plac'd in the Hearts of true  Britains  and upon the View whereof they have acted all along in the Late War and in all their Transactions at Home has obtained the Title of a  REVOLUTION PRINCIPLE  Noting this then as above that Her Majesty is our Queen by vertue of the Revolution and that during Her Reign that Establishment alone must be the Foundation of all Her Administration this must effectually Secure us against any Apprehension that the Persons acting under Her Majesty can Act in behalf of the  Pretender  during Her Majesty's Life for that they must immediately Overthrow the Throne Turn the Queen out of it and Renounce the Revolution upon which Her Majesty's Possession is Established As the Revolution therefore is the Base upon which the Throne of Her Majesty's Possession is Established so her Majesty and all that Act under her are obliged to Act upon the Foot of the said Revolution even  Will  they  Nil  they or else they sink immediately out of rightful Power to Act at all Her Majesty's Title would fall to the Ground their own Commissions would from that Hour be Void they must Declare their Royal Mistress  and Benefactress a Subject to the  Pretender  and all Her Pretences of Rightful Possession Injurious and an Usurpation These things being so plain that he that runs may read them seem to stop all our Mouths from so much as any Suggestion that any Body can Attempt to bring in the  Pretender  upon us during the the Life of Her present Majesty  But what if the Queen should die  Subsequent to the Revolution many Essential things are form'd by our Parliaments and Government for the publick Good on the Foundation of which much of the present Peace of the Nation is Founded and while the said Revolution Foundation stands fast there is good Ground to believe those Essential Points shall be preserved If then we are satisfied that the Revolution Principle shall subsist as long as the Queen Lives then for so long we may have good Ground to believe we shall Enjoy all those Advantages and Benefits which we received from the said Revolution But still when we look back upon those dear Privileges the obtaining of which has Cost so much Money and the Maintaining of which has Cost so much Blood we must with a deep Sigh reflect upon the precarious Circumstances of the Nation whose best  Privileges hang uncertain upon the Nice and tender Thread of Royal Mortality and say we are happy while these last and these may last while Her Majesty shall Live  But what if the Queen should die  Let us Descend to some other Particulars of those Blessings which we do Enjoy purely as the Effect of the Revolution and Examin in what Posture we stand with respect to them and what Assurance we have of their Continuance And First as to  TOLERATION  This was the Greatest and first Blessing the Nation felt after the immediate Settlement of the Crown which was Established by Vertue of the Revolution Engagement mentioned in the Prince of  Orange  's Declaration The Design of this Law as it was to give Liberty for the Worship of God to such Dissenters as could not Conform to the Church of  England  and to give Ease to tender Consciences so as by the Law it self is expressed it was to Ease the Minds of their Majesty's Subjects and to give general Quiet to the Nation whose Peace had been frequently Disturbed by the violence of Persecution We have seen frequent Assurances given of the Inviolable Preservation of this Toleration by Her Majesty from the Throne in Her Speeches  to the Parliament and during Her Majesty's Reign we have great Reason to hope the Quiet of the poor People shall not be broken by either repealing that Law or Invading the Intent and Meaning of it while it remains in Force and there is a great many Reasons to hope that the present Ministry are so far Convinc'd of the Necessity of the said Toleration in order to preserve the Peace and the common Neighbourhood of People that they can have no Thought of Breaking in upon it or any way making the People who Enjoy it uneasie Nay the rather we believe this because the Ferment such a Breach would put the whole Nation into is not the safest Condition the Government can be in upon any Account And as the Ministry cannot be supposed to desire to give Uneasiness and Provocation to the Commons but rather to keep them Easi  and Quiet and prevent the Enemies  the present Management from having any Handle to take hold of to fomen  Distractions and Disturbances among th  People It cannot be thought that the  will push at the Toleration so as to de  +prive the People of so Considerable  Thing But after the present happy  blishment shall have received such a Fa+ Blow as that will be of the Queen  Death and when Popish Pretenders and  French  Influencies shall prevail it may well be expected then that not Toleration of Dissenters only but even of the whole Protestant Religion may be in danger to be Lost so that however secure we are of the free Enjoyment of Liberty of Religion during the Queen's Life we may be very well allow'd to ask this Question with respect to not Toleration only but the Church of  England  also  viz  what will become of them  If the Queen should die  From Toleration in  England  come we to the Constitution of Religious Affairs in  Scotland  and here we have different Views from what the Case in  England  affords us the powerful Interest of Jacobitism if it may be said to be Formidable any where is so there The Enemies of the Revolution are all the Implacable Enemies of the Church Establishment there Nay many Thousands are the declared Enemies of the Revolution and of the Queen's being upon the Throne from a meer Implacable Aversion to the  Presbyterian Kirk  which is Erected and Established by that very Revolution which has set the Queen upon the Throne The  Union  which has yet farther Establish'd that  Prebeterian Kirk  is for that Reason the Aversion of the  same People as it is the Aversion of the  Jacobites  by being a further Confirmation of the  Hannover  Succession and a further Fixing the Queen upon the Throne Now as  it is sure  that  as before  while the Queen Lives and the Revolution Influence carries its usual Force in the Kingdoms now United the  Presbyterian Kirk  must and will remain and all the little Encroachments which have been made upon the  Kirk  as it may be observed tho' they have created Uneasiness enough yet they still seem to suppose that the Establishment it self cannot be overthrown The Union and the Revolution Settlement remain in  Scotland  and must remain as is said While the Queen Lives we can have no Apprehensions of them The Reasons are given above and as we said before we are to take them for granted in this Discourse to avoid other Cavils While then the Revolution and the Union are to be the Foundation of the Administration in  Scotland  the  Presbyterian  Establisht Church Government there must also remain as the only Legal  Kirk  Constitution and so long we can Entertain no Fears of any thing on that Account  But what if the Queen should die  From such Religious Concerns as effect  Presbyterians  and other Sectaries or  Dissenters  as we call them let us take a look at the remote Danger of the Church of  England  We have had a great deal of Distraction in the time of the late Ministry about the Danger of the Church and as it appears by the  Memorial  of the Church of  England  published in those times and Reprinted since by the Sermons of Dr  Sacheverell  and the eminent Speeches at his Trial that Danger was more especially Suggested to come from the Encrease of  Dissenters  here the Ministry of the  Whiggs  and the Establishing  Presbyterianism  in the North of  Britain  These things being in a great Measure now overthrown by the late Change of the Ministry and the new Methods taken in the Management of the publick Affairs the People who were then supposed to Aim at overthrowing the Ministry of those  Whiggs  are pleased to assure us of the Safety and flourishing Condition of the Church now more than ever while the other Party taking up the like Cry of the Danger of the Church tell us that now a real visible appearace of Danger to the Church is before us and that not only to the Church of  England  as such but even to the whole Interest and Safety of  the Protestant Religion in  Britain  that this Danger is imminent and unavoidable from the great Growth and Encrease of  Popery  and profest  Jacobitism  in the Nation This indeed they give but too great Demonstrations of from the spreading of Popish Agents among us whose profest Employment it is to Amuse and Impose upon the poor Country People as well in Matters of  Jacobitism  as of Religion and the great Success these Emissaries of Satan have obtain'd in several Parts of  Britain  but especially in the North Now tho' we cannot but acknowledge but that much of this Alarm is justly Grounded and that the Endeavours of  Popish  and  Jacobite  Agents and Emissaries in diverse Parts of  Britian  are too apparently Successful yet as wise Men could never see into the reality of such Danger as was by some People pretended to be Impending over the Church in the Time of the late Ministry So neither can we allow that Popery is so Evidently at the Door at this Time as that we should be Apprehensive of having the Church of  England  immediately Transvers'd and the Protestant Religion in  Britain  And one great Reason for this Opinion is that Her Majesty who is a Zealous Professor of the Protestant Religion and has been Bred up in the Bosom of the  Church of  England  is so Rooted in Principle and had Declared from Her very Infancy such Horror and Aversion to Popery that it cannot Enter into any true Protestant Thoughts to apprehend any thing of that Kind while Her Majesty lives  BUT  Lord have Mercy upon us  What if the Queen should die  From Religious Matters come we next to consider Civil Interest Liberties Privileges Properties the Great Article that in the late Revolution went always Coupled in the Nation's Negative with that of Religion as if they were woven together and was always Cry'd upon by the Mob in one Breath  viz  No  Popery  no  Slavery  The first of these concerns our Civil Interest such as the Publick Credit by the Occasions of a long and Expensive War and to prevent Levying severe Taxes for the Carrying on the War such as would be Grievous to Trade Oppressive to the Poor and Difficult to be Paid The Parliament for the Ease of the Subjects thought fit rather to lay Funds of Interest to raise Money upon by way of Loan Establishing those Interests payable as Annuities and Annual Payments for the Benefit of those who Advanc'd their Money for the publick Service And to  make these things Current that the publick Credit might be Sacred and the People be made free to Advance their Money all possible Assurances of Parliament have been given that the Payments of Interests and Annuities shall be kept punctually and Exactly according to the Acts of Parliament that no Misapplicaons of the Money shall be made or Converting the Money received upon one to make good the Deficiency of the other and hitherto the Injunctions of that Kind have been exactly observ'd and the Payments punctually made which we call the Credit of the Nation At the first of the late Change when the New Ministry began to Act the Fright the People were put in upon the Suggestion of some that all the Parliamentary Funds should be wiped off with a Spunge was very Considerable and the Credit of those Funds sunk Exceedingly with but the bare Apprehension of such a Blow the Sums being Infinitely great and the Number of Indigent Families being Incredibly many whose whole Substance lay in those Securities and whose Bread depended upon those Interests being punctually Paid But wiser Men saw quickly there was no Ground for those Fears that the New Ministry stood upon a Foot that could no  more be Supported without the publick Credit than those that went before them that Especially while they were under a Necessity of Borrowing further Sums they behoved to Secure the punctual Paying of the Old and by making the People entirely Easie not only take from them the Apprehensions they were under of Losing what they Lent already but make them forward and willing to Advance more to this Purpose They not only Endeavoured to give the People all possible Satisfaction that their Money was Safe and that the Funds laid by the Parliament in the former Ministry should be kept Sacred and the Payments punctually made but took care to obtain Parliamentary Securities by real Funds to be Settled for the Payment of those Debts contracted by the former Ministry and for which no Provision was made before This was the Establishment of a Fund for Payment of the Interests of the  Navy  Debt Ordnance Victualling Transport  c  to the Vallue of Seven or Eight Millions which is the Substance of what we now call the SouthSea Stock By this means the publick Credit which it was Suggested would receive such a Blow at the Change as that it should never recover again and that it would be Impossible for the New Ministry  to Raise any needful Sums of Money for the Carrying on the War or for the publick Occasions recovered it self so as that the Government hath ever since found it Easie to Borrow what ever Sums they thought fit to Demand in the same manner as before Now that these Loans are Safe no Man that weighs the Circumstances of the Ministry and Government and the Circumstances of the People can Doubt the first being in a constant Necessity of Supporting the publick Credit for the Carrying on publick Affairs on any suddain Emergency that may happen and being liable to the Resentment of Parliament if any open Infraction should be made upon the Funds which touches so nearly the Honour of the Parliaments and the Interest of most of the best Families in the Nation While this is the Case we think it is not Rational to believe that any Ministry will venture to attack Parliamentary Credit in such a manner and this will Eminently be the Case as long as Her Majesty sits on the Throne Nor can a thing so barefac'dly Tyrannical and Arbitrary and above all Dishonourble and Unjust be Suggested as possible to be Attempted in the Reign of so Just and Consciencious a Prince So that we may be very willing to allow that  there is not the least Danger of the publick Faith being Broken the publick Credit lost the publick Funds stopt or the Money being Misapply'd No Cheat no Spunge while Her Majesty  BUT  Alas for us  What if the Queen should die  From this piece of Civil Right come we to those Things we call Liberties and Privileges These may indeed be joyned in some Respects but as we are Engag'd in speaking particularly to such Points wherein our present Dangers do or do not appear It is proper to mention them apart  Privileges  may be distinguished here from Liberties as they respect Affairs of Trade Corporations Parliaments and Legislature  c Liberty  as they respect Laws Establishments declared Right and such like As to the first from the Revolution to this Time they have not only been Confirm'd which we had before but many Privileges added to the People Some of which are Essential to the wellbeing of the Kingdom All the  Quo Warranto's  against Corporation Privileges the HighCommission Court against the Church's Privileges extending Prerogative in Detriment of the Subjects natural Right and many such things which were Fatal to the Privileges of this Protestant  Nation were laid aside and received their just Condemnation in the Revolution and not so only but the Privileges obtain'd since the Revolation by Consent of Parliament are very considerable such as the Toleration to this part of  Britain  and the Establishment of the Church of  Scotland  For the North part in matters of Religion such as the Triennial Election of Parliaments In Civil Affairs such as the several Corporations Granted upon really useful Foundations in Trade as the  Bank Company  c and such like These and many more which may be Named and which these are Named only as Heads of are Secured to us by Law and those Laws yet again made sure to us by the Honour and Veracity of Her Majesty and as long as Her Majesty's Life is spared to these Nations we have great Reason to believe we shall rather Encrease than Lose our Privileges  BUT what if the Queen should die  Our  LIBERTIES  which come next in Order may be Summ'd up in what we call  Legal  and  Native  Right or such as by the natural Consequence of a Free Nation and a just Government or such as by mutual Assent and Consent of Soveraign and Subject are become the  Legal Right of the latter These needless to be Enumerated here are Summ'd up into One or are expresly Enacted by Statute Law and thereby become Fundamental to the Constitution These receive no Wound but one of these two ways either by open Infraction and Contempt of Right or by Dispensing Arbitrary Power both of which by the many Assurances from the Throne by the constant Jealousies of Parliaments and the full Liberty they have more of late than ever taken to Examin into and Censure Breaches of the Laws We are very well assured shall not be Attempted in Her Majesty's time Nay on the contrary the Superiority and Influence of Parliaments over and upon the Management of publick Matters Nay even their Influences upon the Royal Majesty of the Soveraign has been such and has in such a manner Insensibly Increased of Late that the like has never been known or Practised in this Nation for some Ages before We see Her Majesty declines Extending Her Perogative either to the Detriment of Her Subjects in Cases Civil or Religious and wherein it might be so Extended nay when even the Parliament have desir'd Her to Extend it So that we have a great Satisfaction in the Safety of our Established Liberties and  that no Tyrannical Arbitrary Invasions of Right shall be made during Her Majesty's Reign  BUT what if the Queen should die  In like manner for our Properties our Estates Inheritance Lands Goods Lives Liberties  c  These are effectually Secured by Laws of the Land and the Sovereign in this Counrty having no Right but by Law to any part of the Subjects Estate Causes that Estate to be called  PROPERTY  The Kings and Queens of  Britain  are Monarchs limited to Act by the Laws When they Cease to Rule by Law the Constitution is Broken and they become Tyrants and Arbitrary Despotick Invaders of Right This is Declared by the Revolution wherein the Right of the Subject are openly not set down only but Claim'd Demanded at what Justice required should be Granted to them and as what the Soveraign as aforesaid has no Right no Pretence no just Authority to take or detain from him This is the Great Capital and Fundamental Article of  MagnaCharta  and the Foundation upon which all the Laws Subsequent and Consequential to  MagnaCharta  have been made  No freeman shall be Taken or Imprisoned or be Disseized of  his Freehold or Liberties or Free Customs or be Outlawed or Exiled or otherwise Destroyed nor we will not pass upon him nor Condemn him but by Lawful Iudgement of his Peers or by the Law of the Land  MagnaCharta  Cap xxix The Words are Plain and Direct and as to the Subject we are now upon they require no Comment no Explication Whatever they do as to Pleading in Law the Proof of the Subject's Right to the free Possession of his own Property is also the less needful to Enlarge upon here because it is acknowledged in full and express Terms by the Soveraign as well in Practise as in Expression Her Majesty adhering strictly to this as a Rule has from the beginning of Her Reign made it Her  Golden Rule  to Govern according to Law Nor while the Establishment of the Crown it self is Built upon the Legal Constitution of this Nation can it be otherwise here That Prince that Governs here and not by Law may be said rather to Oppress than to Govern rather to Overrule than to Rule over his People  NOW  it cannot without great and unjustifyable Violence to Her Majesty's just Government be Suggested that we are in any Danger of Oppression during the Righteous Administration of Her Majesty's Reign The Queen  Raises no Money without Act of Parliament keeps up no Standing Army in time of  Peace  Disseizes no Man of his Property or Estate but every Man Sits in Safety under his own Vine and his Figtree and we doubt not but we shall do as long as Her Majesty Lives  BUT what if the Queen should die  Possibly Cavils may Rise in the Mouths of those whose Conduct this Nice Question may seem to Affect that this is a Question unfit to be asked and Questionless such People will have much to say upon that Subject as that it is a Factious Question a Question Needless to be Answered and Impertinent therefore to be askt that it is a Question which respects things remote and serves only to fill the Heads of the People with Fears and Jealousies that it is a Question to which no direct Answer can be given and which Suggests strange Surmises and amuses People about they know not what and is of no use but to make People uneasie without Cause  As there is no Objection which is Material enough to make but is Material enough to Answer so this altho' there is nothing of Substance in it may  Introduce something in its Answer of Substance enough to consider It is therefore most necessary to Convince the considering Reader of the Usefulness and Necessity of putting this Question and then likewise the Usefulness and Necessity of putting this Question  NOW  at this time and if it appear to be both a needful Question it self and a seasonable Question as to time the rest of the Cavils against it will deserve the less regard That it is a needful Question seems justified more abundantly from a very great Example to wit the Practise of the whole Nation in Settling the Succession to the Crown This I take to be nothing else but this The Queen having no Issue of Her Body and the Pretender to the Crown being Expelled by Law Included in his Father's Disastrous Flight and Abdication when the Parliament came to Consider of the State of the Nation as to Government as it now stands that King  William  being lately Dead and Her Majesty with universal Joy of Her People being reciev'd as Queen the Safety and the lasting Happiness of the Nation is so far Secur'd  BUT what if the Queen should die  The Introduction to all the Acts of Parliaments for Settling the Crown Implies  thus much and speaks directly this Language  viz  to make the Nation Safe and Easie in Case the Queen should die Nor are any of those Acts of Parliament Impeach'd of Faction or Impertinencies much less of Needless blaming the People and filling their Heads with Fears and Jealousies If this Example of the Parliament is not enough Justifying to this Enquiry the well known Truth upon which that Example of Parliament is Grounded is sufficient to justifie it  viz  That we all known the Queen  MUST die  None say this with more Concern and Regret than those who are forwardest to put this Question as being of the Opinion abovesaid that we are effectually Secured against the Pretender and against all the terrifying Consequences of the  Frenchify'd  Govournours during Her Majesty's Life But this is Evident  the Queen is Mortal  tho' crown'd with all that Flattering Courtiers can bring together to make Her appear Great Glorious Famous or what you please yet the Queen yea the Queen Her self is  Mortal  and  MUST die  It is true Kings and Queens are called Gods but this respects their Sacred Power nothing supposing and Immortallity attending their Persons for they all  Die  like other Men and their Dust knows  no Distinction in the Grave Since then it is most certain that the Queen  MUST die  and our Safety and Happiness in this Nation depends so much upon the Stability of our Liberties Religion and aforesaid Dependencies after Her Majesty's Life shall End it cannot be a Question Offensive to any who has any Concern in the Publick good to enquire into what shall be the State of our Condition or the Posture of our Affairs when the Queen shall die  but this is not all neither  As the Queen is Mortal and we are assured she must die so we are none of us certain as to be able to know when or how soon that Disaster may happen at what time or in what manner This then as it may be remote and not a long time  God of his Infinite Mercy grant it may be long first and not before this difficult Question we are upon be Effectually and Satisfactorily Answered to the Nation  So on the other side it may be  near  None of us know how  near  the fatal Blow may befal us soon and sooner far than we may be ready for to day it may come while the cavilling Reader is objecting against our putting this Question and calling it Unreasonable and Needless while the Word is in thy very Mouth mayest thou hear the fatal Melancholly News  the Queen's  Dead  News that must one time or other be heard the Word will certainly come some time or other to be spoken in the present Sense and to be sure in the time they are spoken in How can any one then say that it is improper to ask what shall be our Case what shall we do or what shall be done with us  if the Queen should die  But we have an other Melancholy Incident which attends the Queen's Mortality and which makes this Question more than ordinarily seasonable to be ask'd at this time and that is that not only the Queen is Mortal and she  MUST die  and the time uncertain so that she  may die  even to Day before to Morrow or in a very little space of time But Her Life is under God's Providence at the Mercy of  Papists  and  Jacobites  People who the one by their Principles and the other by the Circumstances of their Party are more than ordinarily to be Apprehended for their bloody Designs against Her Majesty and against the whole Nation Nay there seems more Reason to be Apprehensive of the dangerous Attempts of these desperate People at this time than ever even from the very Reasons which are given all along in this Work for our  being Safe in our Privileges our Religious and Civil Rights during Her Majesty's Life it would be mispending your time prove to that the  Papists  and  Jacobite  Parties in this Nation however they may as we have said be under Tyes and Obligations of Honour Interest and Gratitude  c  Not to make attempt upon us during the Queen's Life yet that they are more Encouraged at this time than ever they were to hope and believe that when the Queen shall die their Turn stands next This we say we believe is lost Labour to speak of The said People the  Popish  and  Tory  Party will freely own and oppose it They all take their Obligations to the Queen to End with Her Majesty's Life The  French King  however in Honour and Gratitude he may think himself bound to Encourage the  Pretender  to insult Her Majesty's Dominions while the Queen with whom he Personally is Engaged by Treaty shall remain alive will think himself fully at Liberty from those Obligations when the Queen shall die If we are misinform'd of the  French  Affairs and of the Notions they have in  France  of these things they are generally no otherwise understood then that the King of  France  is Engag'd by the Peace now in View not to disturb Her Majesty's Possession during Her Reign  and Life but that then the  Pretender's  Right is to be receiv'd every where The  Pretender  himself howsoever as abovesaid he may despair of his Success in Attempting to take Possession during the Queen's Life will not fail to assume new Hopes at Her Majesty's Death So much then of the hopes of  Popery  and  French  Power so much of the Interest of the  Pretender  depending upon the single Thread of Life of a Mortal Person and we being well assur'd that they look upon Her Majesty only as the Incumbent in a Living or Tenant for Life in an Estate what is more Natural than in this Case for us to apprehend Danger to the Life of the Queen Especially to such People who are known not to make much Consciencies of Murthering Princes with whom the King killing Doctrine is so Universally receiv'd and who were so often Detected of villanious Practices and Plots against the Life of Queen  Elizabeth  Her Majesty's famous Predecessor and that upon the same Foundation  viz  The Queen of  Scots  being the  Popish Pretender  to the Crown what can we expect from the same Party and Men acting from the same Principles but the same Practices It is known that the Queen by Course of Nature may Live many Years and these People have many  Reasons to be Impatient of so much Delay They know that many Accidents may Intervene to make the Circumstances of the Nation at the Time of the Queen's Death less favourable to their Interests than they are now they may have fewer Friends as well in Power as out of Power by length of time and the like These and such as these Considerations may excite Vilanious and Murtherous Practices against the precious Life of our Soveraign God protect Her Majesty from them but while all these Considerations so Naturally offer themselves to us it seems most Rational needful seasonable and just that we should be Asking and Answering this great Question  What if the Queen should die  Thus far we have only asked the Question it self and shewed our Reasons or Endeavoured to Justifie the Reasonablness of the Enquiry It follows that we make some brief Essay as an Answer to the Question This may be done many ways but the Design of this Tract is rather to put the Question into your Thought than to put an Answer into your Mouths The several Answers which may be given to this Important Question may not be proper for a publick Print and some may  not be fit so much as to be spoken The Question is not without its Uses whether it be Answered or no if the Nation be sufficiently Awaken'd but to ask the Question among themselves they will be brought by thinking of the thing to Answer it one to another in a short Space The People of  Britain  want only to be shewed what imminent Danger they are in in Case of the Queen's Decease How much their Safety and Felicity depends upon the Life of Her Majesty and what a State of Confusion Distress and all Sorts of dreadful Calamities they will fall into at Her Majesty's Death if something be not done to Settle them before Her Death and if they are not during Her Majesty's Life secured from the Power of  France  and the Danger of the  Pretender▪  FINIS
