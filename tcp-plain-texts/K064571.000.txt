 A THIRD DISCOURSE ON THE MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR    In VIEW of the Present Controversy between INFIDELS and APOSTATES  Litteratos gravissimo Somno stertere convincam  HIERON  By THOMAS WOOLSTON sometime Fellow of  SidneyCollege  in  Cambridge  LONDON Printed for the Author and Sold by him next Door below the  Star  in  Aldermanbury  and by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price One Shiling  TO THE Right Reverend Father in GOD  RICHARD  Lord Bishop of St DAVID'S  MY LORD  _IN your  Sermon  before the  Society  for Reformation of Manners you are pleased to give  Discourse on Christ's Miracles  Notice of them a  Favour  that I have long'd for from a considerable  Clergyman  but could nor flatter  myself with the Hopes of receiving it from so great a  Prelate  Some of the inferior  Clergy  whom I despise for their Ignorance and Malice have before in their Conversation represented me as an  impious  and  blasphemous Infidel  and I have met with Affronts for it But I never imagin'd that any much less your  Lordship  would have ventur'd such a Character of me from the  Press  for fear of a Resentment which would not be agreeable Surely your  Lordship  has not read my  Discourses  but has taken a Report of them upon Trust from some Ecclesiastical  Noodle  or you could never have been so much mistaken about my Design in them  I took myself to be a Christian of the same Faith with the Fathers of the Church and without Vanity think I have publish'd some Tracts in Defence of Christianity  equal if not superior to any Thing this Age has produced I repeatedly also in my  Discourses on Miracles  to obviate the Prejudices of an ignorant  Clergy  made solemn Protestations of the Sincerity of my Design not to do Service to Infidelity but to make Way for the Demonstration of  Jesus  's Messiahship from Prophecy But all these Asseverations of the Integrity of my Heart it seems stand for nothing and I don't wonder at it with the  Clergy  who in their Principles their Oaths and Subscriptions are so accustom'd to prevaricate with God and Man I shall make no more serious Protestations of my Faith but expect your  Lordship  should soon publish a Defence of your foul Charge against me that I may see what Skill you have in the impious and blasphemous Writings of an Infidel  And if your  railing Accusation  be not soon followed with a Dissertatation  of more Reason I shall insist on a publick Reparation of the Injury done to my Reputation by your  vile  and  slanderous  Sermon and appeal to the worshipful  Societies  for Reformation of Manners whether it be not just and reasonable you should do one or the other  Now I have laid hold of your  Lordship  than whom I could not have wish'd for an  Adversary  that will do me more Honour to overcome I will hold you fast and you must expect to be teaz'd and insulted from the  Press  if you enter not the Lists against me  A clear Stage  my Lord  and no Favour If you have the Sword of the Spirit in your Hand cut as sharply as you can with it I had conceiv'd a great Opinion of your Learning and should have been a little apprehensive of the Power of it if you had not in your Sermon betray'd  as great Weakness and Ignorance as could be in a poor  Curat  or you had never asserted that the  Greek  Commentators adher'd more strictly to the litteral Sense of the Holy Scriptures as if you knew not that St  Theophilus  of  Antioch  and even  Origen  himself and others the greatest  Allegorists  if a Comparison may be made were  Commentators  of the  Greek  Church  The sooner your Lordship appears from the  Press  the better in as much as you may possibly prevent my Publication of more  Discourses  of this Kind And that it may not be long first I will accept of a Dissertation from you on any two or three of the Miracles I have handled as sufficient for all Take your Choice of them but don't I beseech you touch the Miracle of  Jesus  's driving the  Buyers  and  Sellers  out of the Temple because it is a  hot  one and may possibly burn  your Fingers The Miracles that I have most ludicrously and of consequence most offensively handled are the two of this present Discourse If you please  my Lord  let them be the easy and short Task imposed on you If you can defend the Letter of the Stories of these two Miracles I'll quietly give up the Rest to you  So heartily thanking your Lordship for the Favour done me in taking Notice of my  Discourses on Miracles  which shall be turn'd to good Use and Advantage I subscribe myself  My LORD  Your most obliged Humble Servant  Tho Woolston  Feb  A THIRD DISCOURSE On The MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR  c  _MY two former Discourses having met with a favourable Reception I am encourag'd to go on and publish another which without any more Preface I enter upon by a Repetition of the three general Heads at first proposed to be spoken to and they were  I To show that the Miracles of healing all Manner of bodily Diseases which  Jesus  was justly famed for are none of the proper Miracles of the  Messiah  neither are they so much as a good Proof of his divine Authority to found a Religion  II To prove that the literal History of many of the Miracles of  Jesus  as recorded by the  Evangelists  does imply Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities consequently they either in whole or in part were never wrought as they are commonly believed nowadays but are only related as prophetical and parabolical Narratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  III To consider what  Jesus  means when he appeals to his Miracles as to a Testimony and a Witness of his divine Authority and to show that he could not properly and ultimately refer to those he then wrought in the  Flesh  but to those Mystical ones that he would do in the  Spirit  of which those wrought in the Flesh are but meer Types and Shadows  Tho' I have already spoken what may be thought sufficient to the first of these Heads yet I have several Things still both  from Reason and Authority to add to it but having not here a convenient Place for that Purpose I defer it to a better Opportunity and so pass immediately to the Resumption of my  II Second general Head and that is to prove that the literal History of many of the Miracles of  Jesus  as recorded by the  Evangelists  does imply Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities consequently they either in whole or in part were never wrought as it is commonly believed nowa days but are only related as prophetical and parabolical Narratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  To this Purpose I have taken into Examination six of the Miracles of  Jesus    viz  those  Of his driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple  Of his exorcising the  Devils  out of the Madmen and sending them into the Herd of Swine  Of his Transfiguration on the Mount  Of his healing a Woman that had an Issue of Blood twelve Years  Of his curing a Woman that had a Spirit of Infirmity eighteen Years and  Of his telling the  Samaritan  Woman her Fortune of having had five Husbands and being then an Adulteress with another Man  Whether I have not prov'd the Storys of these Miracles either in whole or in part to consist of Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities according to the Proposition before us I leave my  Readers  to judge and now will take in Hand  A Seventh Miracle of  Jesus    viz  that  Matt  Chap xxi  Mark  Chap xi  of his cursing the Figtree    for not bearing Fruit out of Season  which Miracle upon the bare mention of it appears to be such an absurd foolish and ridiculous if not malicious and illnatured Act in  Jesus  that I question whether for Folly and Absurdity it can be equalled in any Instance of the Life of a reputed wise Man The Fathers such as  Origen  St  Augustin  St  John of Jerusalem  and others have all said as smart Things as the wittyest Infidels can against the Letter of this Story St  Augustin  Hoc factum nisi figuratum stultum invenitur  In Serm  lxxvii  very plainly says that  this Fact in Jesus  upon Supposition that it was done was  a foolish one  If therefore I treat  this Story a little more ludicrously than ordinary and expose the Folly of the Fact as well as of the modern Belief of it I hope their Authority and Example will plead my Excuse for it  Jesus  was hungary it seems and being disappointed of Figs to the Satisfaction of his Appetite cursed the Figtree Why so peevish and impatient Our  Divines  when they please make  Jesus  the most patient resign'd and easy under Sufferings Troubles and Disappointments of any Man If he really was so he could hardly have been so much out of Humour for want of a few Figs to the Allay of his Hunger But to curse the Figtree upon it was as foolishly and passionately done as for another Man to throw the Chairs and Stools about the House because his Dinner is not ready at a critical Time or before it could be got ready for him  But  Jesus  was hungry some will say and the Disappointment provoked him What if he was hungry He should as he knew the Return of his Appetite have made a better and more certain Provision for it Where was  Judas  his Steward and Caterer with his Bag of Victuals as well as Money Poor Forecast  and Management amongst them or  Jesus  had nevet trusted to the uncertain Fruits of a Figtree which he espy'd at a Distance for his Breakfast  And if  Jesus  was frustrated of a long'dfor Meal of Figs what need he have so reveng'd the Disappointment on the  Nulla esset Ligni Culpa quia Lignum sine sensu non habebat Culpam Augustin  in Serm  lxxxix  sensless and faultless Tree Was it because he was forc'd to fast longer than usual and expedient not so I hope neither Could not Angels if he was in a desert Place have administred unto him Or could not he miraculously have created Bread for himself and his Company as he multiplied or increased the Loaves for his Thousands in the Wilderness What Occasion then for his being out of Humour for want of Food If he was of Power to provide Bread for others on a sudden he might sure have supply'd his own Necessities and so have kept his Temper without breaking into a violent Fit of Passion upon present Want and Disappointment  But what is yet worse  the Time of Figs was not yet  when Jesus look'd and long'd for them Did ever any one here  or read of any Thing more  Quaerit poma necesciebat tempus nondum esse quod Cultor Arboris sciebat Creator Arboris nesciebat  Augustini in Serm  lxxxix  unreasonable than for a Man to expect Fruit out of Season  Jesus  could not but know this before he came to the Tree and if he had had any Consideration he would not have expected Figs on it much less if he had regarded his own Reputation as a wise Man would he have so resented the Want of them What if a  Yeoman  of  Kent  should go to look for  Pipins  in his Orchard at  Easter  the supposed Time  Hoc ideo probamus quia Passionis Domini Dies propinquabat et scimus quo tempore passus sit  Ibid  that  Jesus  sought for these Figs and because of a Disappointment cut down all his Trees What then would his Neighbours make of him Nothing less than a  LaughingStock  and if the Story got into our publick News he would be the Jest and Ridicule of Mankind How  Jesus  salv'd his Credit upon this his wild Prank and prevented the Laughter of the  Scribes  and  Pharisees  upon it I know not but I cannot think of this Part of the Letter of this Story without smiling at it at this Day and wonder our  Divines  are not laugh'd  out of Countenance for reading it gravely and having  Jesus  in Admiration for it  Again I would gladly know whose Figtree this was and whether  Jesus  had any legal Right to the Fruit if haply he had found any on it or any Leave or Authority to smite it with a Curse for its Unfruitfulness As to the Tree's being  Jesus  's Property that could not be For he was so far from being either Landlord or Tenant that it's said he had not where to lay his Head During the Time of his Ministry he was but a Wanderer like a Mendicant Fryar or an itenerant Preacher and before that Time was no better than a Journeyman Carpenter of whose Workmanship I wonder the Church of  Rome  has no holy Relicks not so much as a Threefootedstool or a Pair of Nutcrackers consequently he had no House nor Land of his own by Law much less any Figtree and least of all  this  which he espy'd at a distance in his Travels How then had he any Right to the Figs if he had met with any I hope he ask'd Leave beforehand of the Proprietor or  Infidels  will say of him that if he had had an Opportunity he would have been a  RobOrchard  And if he had no Right to the Fruit much less to smite the Tree with a Curse where was  his Honour  Arbor non est justé siccata  Johan Hierosol in Loc Marci  his Justice his Goodness and his Honesty in this Act The  Evangelists  if they would have us to think  Jesus  did no wrong to any Man should have left us somewhat upon Record to Satisfaction in this Case or  Infidels  who have here Scope for it will think worse of  Jesus  than possibly he may deserve Whether  Jesus  modestly speaking met with any Blame or Reprimand from the Proprietor for his Act of Execration none can affirm or deny But if any one so spitefully and maliciously should destroy almost any other Tree whether fruitful or not of another Man's in this Country he would have good Luck if he escaped the House of Correction for it  And what now have our  Divines  to say to all this Reasoning against the Letter of this Story Nothing more than "That the Act of cursing the Figtree whether it be at this Distance of Time reconcileable to Reason Justice and Prudence or not was a supernatural Work above the Power of Nature or Art to imitate consequently it was a Miracle and they will admire and adore  Jesus  for it" And to agree with them at present that it was a real Miracle and a supernatural Event yet I hope they'll acknowledge that if  Jesus  as St  Augustin  Si miraculum fuerat tantummodo commendandum et non alquid prophetice figurandum multo clementiùs dominus et sua misericordia digniùs fecerat Si quam aridam invenerit viridem redderet sicut languentes sanavit Tunc vero e contrario quasi adversus Regulam Clementiae suae invenit Arborem virentem praeter tempus fructus nondum habentem non tamen fructum agricolae negantem et aridam fecit  In Serm  lxxxix  Sect    says had instead of cursing the Figtree made a dry dead and withered one immediately to bud flourish and revive and in an Instant to bring forth ripe Fruits out of Season it would have pleased them much better Such an Instance of his Power had been an indisputable Miracle Such an Instance of his divine Power had carry'd Goodness along with it and none of the foresaid Exceptions could have been made to it Such an Instance of his Almighty Power had been a Demonstration of his being Lord of the Creation and Author of the Fruits of the Earth for the Use of Man in their Season or he could not have produced them out of Season In such  an Instance of Power his divine Care and Providence against Hunger and Want would have been visible and it would have been an Admonition to us to depend daily upon him for the Comforts and Necessaries of Life Such an Instance of his Power would have been as St  Augustin  says above like his Miracles of healing Diseases of making the Languid  Sound  and the Feeble  Strong  and we might more certainly have infer  d from one with the other that both were the Operations of a good God But this Instance of his cursing the Figtree in this Fashion spoils the Credit and sullies the Glory of his other Miracles It is in its own Nature of such a malevolent Aspect that its enough to make us suspect the Beneficence of  Christ  in his other Works and to question whether there might not be some latent Poyson and diabolical Design under the Colour of his fairer Pretences to Almighty Power It is so like the malignant Practices of  Witches  who as Stories go upon Envy Grudge or Distaste smite their Neighbours Cattle with languishing Distempers till they die that it's hard if not impossible to distinguish one from the other in Spite and Malice If  Mahomet  and not  Jesus  had been the Author  of this Miracle our  Divines  would presently have discover'd the  Devil  's Foot in it and have said that  Satan  drew him into a Scrape in the Execution of this mad and foolish Frolick on purpose to expose  him  for a  Wizard  and  his  Musselmen of all Ages since for Fools in believing on him The Spirit of  Christ  who is all Love and Mercy should one Would think breath forth nothing but Goodness and Kindness to Mankind but that such a pestilential Blast like a mortiferous NorthEast Wind in some Seasons should proceed from his Mouth to the Destruction of another Man's harmless and inossensive Tree is what none upon Earth can account for  Our  Divines  one or other of them have publish'd several notable Notions about Miracles and have laid down good Rules to distinguish  true  from  false  ones but none of them as far as I perceive have taken any Pains to shew the Consistence of  Jesus  's Miracles to their own Rules and Notions Mr  Chandler  who as the  Archbishop  See Archbishop  Wake  's Letter to Mr  Chandler  which is handed about Town and Country  says has rightly stated the Notion of a Miracle among  his Rules of judging by whom Miracles are perform'd says  Vindication of the Christian Religion p  That the Things pretended to be done are to be such as that it is consistent with the Perfections of God to interest himself in  and again  they must be such as answer to the Character of God as a good and gracious Being  and again  It seems reasonable to believe that whenever the first and best of Beings is pleased to send an extraordinary Messenger with a Revelation of his Will he will furnish him with such Proofs of his Mission as may argue not only the Power of him in whose Name he comes but his Love to Mankind and his Inclination to do them good  I have no Dislike to these Notions of Mr  Chandler  but as it is not to be questioned that he and the  Archbishop  too had this Miracle of  Jesus  's cursing the Figtree and some others as of  his boisterous driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple  of  his sending the Devils into the Herd of Swine  of  his turning Water into Wine for the Use of Men    who had before well drank  c in his View when he gave forth the foresaid Rules for acute and learned Writers in Theology are supposed to have their Wits about them so it is  to be hop'd that he or the  Archbishop  will soon publish somewhat to reconcile these Miracles of  Jesus  to their own Notions tho' I don't expect it before  latter Lammas  But after all it may be questioned if Infidels should go about it whether this Work of  Jesus  was miraculous and whether there was not more of the Craft of Man than of the Power of God in it or to use Mr  Chandler  's  Ibid  Words Whether it don't  look like the little Tricks and cunning Deceits of Impostors  St  Matthew  says  presently the Figtree withered away  but this  presently  is an indeterminate Time and may be understood of a Day or a Week or two as well as of the Moment in which the Words were spoken  Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever  St  Mark  says  that in the Morning as the Disciples passed by    they saw the Figtree dry'd up from the Roots  which was at least the Day  Quod sequenti die viderint exaruisse ficum  Theophylact in Locum Marci  after the Curse was utter'd so that there was certainly four and twenty Hours for its withering and if it is said that the  Tree dry'd up from the Roots  it does not imply that the Trunk of it perish'd or was reduc'd to  nothing but only that the green Leaves of the Whole and of every Part of it were in a withering Condition And might not all this be done without a Miracle What if  Jews  and  Infidels  should say that  Jesus  being minded to impose on his Disciples and Followers took a secret Opportunity beforehand to lay his Capenter's Ax to the Root of this Tree and so imperceptibly circumcised it as that the Leaves did what they will do wither in a Night and a Day's Time God forbid that I should think  Jesus  did so but as to the Possibility of such a Fraud in an Impostor none can doubt of it  I am so far from thinking there was any such Fraud in this supposed Miracle of  Jesus  that I don't believe it was at all done by him according to the Letter And for this I have not only a clear and intrinsick Proof from the Story itself but the Authority of the Fathers St  Ambrose  treating on the Parable of the Figtree in  Chap xiii  St  Luke  intimates that what St  Matthew  and St  Mark  write of  Jesus  's cursing the Figtree is but  Quid sibi vult quod in Evangelio suo Dominus Fici Parabolam  frequenter  inducit Habes enim alibi quod jussu Domini Viriditas omnis hujus Ligni frondentis aurerit  In Loc Lucae  Part of the same Parable  And St  John  of  Jerusalem  Vidiamus ubi alibi scriptum de ist a ficu in Evangelio secundum Lucam legimus c  In Loc Marci Hom  xii  says expressly enough that the three  Evangelists  write of one and the same Figtree consequently parabolically and that what St  Matthew  and St  Mark  write of it was no more a literal Transaction than the Parable in St  Luke  Thanks to these holy Fathers for their ridding us of the Belief of the Letter of this Story which otherwise might have perplex'd us with its Absurdities before urg'd And to their Opinion I desire it may be added and considered whether it be not as reasonable in itself to take what the three  Evangelists  write of this Figtree as Part of one Story as well as what they write of the  Woman with her Issue of Blood  and of  Jesus's casting the Devils out of the Madmen  and of other Miracles which are but several Relations of the same Story Parable or Miracle Neither is it any Argument for a literal Transaction of this Miracle that the  Evangelists  speak of it as a Thing done For as  Origen  says there are some Things spoken of in the  Evangelists  as Facts which were never transacted so it is of the Nature of Prophecy and our  Saviour in his whole Life prophesied to speak of Things to come as if they were already past because such Prophecies are not to be understood till after their Accomplishment and then the Reason of the Use of the  praeter  instead of the  future  Tense in Prophecy will be visible But what in my Opinion is an absolute Demonstration that there's no Truth in the Letter of this Story is what our Saviour adds upon the Disciples wondering at the sudden withering of the Figtree saying  Matth  Chap xxi  that if they had Faith    they should not only do what was done to the Figtree    but should say to this Mountain  that was near him I suppose  be thou removed and cast into the Sea    and it shall be done  But these Things were never litterally done by them consequently  Jesus  himself did not litterally curse the Figtree or the Disciples wanted Faith for the doing the said Miracles which is an Absurdity to suppose or  Jesus  talked idly of a Promise to invest them with a Power they were never to be possess'd of But of what ill Consequence to Religion either of these Suppositions is let the old Objection  in  Paschasius Ratbertus  Quanquam igitur juxta Literam haec facta non legantur ab Apostolis sicut quidam Paganorum calumniati sunt et garriunt contra nos etiam in suis scriptis asserentes Apostolos non habuisse fidem quia montes non transtulerunt neque Ficulneas verbo exsiccarunt  In Loc Matth  speak which I shall not stay here to urge and revive but only say at present that if  Jesus  actually cursed a Figtree his Disciples ought to have done so too and to remove Mountains If we adhere to the Letter in one Case we must in the other also but we are only to look to the Mystery in both or St  Augustin  Legimus Apostolorum miracula nusquam autem legimus arborem ab his arefactam aut montem in mare translatum quaeramus ergo in mysterio ubi factum sit non enim Verba Domini vacare potuerant  In Serm  lxxxix  will tell us that  Jesus  utter'd vain empty and insignificant Words and Promises  St  Augustin  who believes no more of the Letter of this Story than I do says that Works of  Jesus  are all figurative and of a spiritual Signification which is so manifest from his Act of cursing the Figtree as Men must  Sed futurum aliquid Miraculo commendasse multa sunt quae nos admoneant nobis{que} persuadeant imo ab  invitis  exterqueant  Ibid  whether    they will or not  acknowledge it But he is mistaken Tho' there might be none in his Time  who would question that this supposed Fact of  Jesus  had a mystical Signification yet if he had liv'd in our Days he would have met with  Divines  who for all the foresaid Absurdities and their Cogency to drive us to Allegory do adhere to the Letter only whether the Truth Credibility and Reasonableness of it be defensible or not But then to do Justice to St  Augustin  's Assertion he would have met with others who  against their Wills  interpret this Miracle figuratively such as Dr  Hammond  and Dr  Whitby  who say  Jesus  cursed the Figtree by way of Type of the Destruction of the  Jewish  State which declined and wasted away after the Similitude of this withering Tree But why then don't these  Commentators  allegorically interpret and apply other Miracles of our Saviour Because they think the Letter will stand good and abide the Test without an Allegory And why do they allegorise this Miracle only Because of the Dificulties and Absurdities of the Letter which they can't account for And are these Reasons good No certainly The  Evangelists  should have made the Distinction for them They should have told us which Miracles are to be allegoris'd and mystically applied and which are not or we are to allegorise all or none at all  how came these modern Allegorists of this Miracle to apply it as they do and to make it a mystical Representation of the Ruin of the  Jewish  State Did they take up this Notion of their own Heads or did they borrow it of the Fathers Why in all Probability they took the Hint from the Fathers wherefore then don't they what none of them do cite and acknowledge their Authors for it Because like Men of Subtilty they would be thought to devise it of themselves for if they had quoted the Fathers for it the Fathers would have oblig'd them upon their Authority to allegorise the rest of  Jesus  's Miracles in the way that I have interpreted some of them but this would not have agreed with their Stomachs for many Reasons No Thanks then to the aforsaid  Commentators  for their allegorical Application of this Miracle which they are again to desert or abide the Consequence of allegorising others also which for their Interests and Reputations they will not do Therefore let them return again to the Letter of this Miracle and say for it what is all that is to be said for it with  Victor Antiochenus  an Apostatical Writer of the  fifth Century  Porro quando in hunc locum incidimus nemo curiosè inquirat aut anxie disputet justene an secus factum sit sed Miraculum editum contempletur et admiretur Nam de submersis Porcis quo{que} nonnulli hanc quaestionem moverant factum{que} justitiae colore destitutum praedicare veriti non sunt  In Loc Marci  that when we read this Passage of Scripture concerning the Figtree  Jesus  cursed we ought not curiously to enquire whether it was wisely or justly done of  Jesus  or not    but we ought to contemplate and admire this Miracle    as well as that of  Jesus'  s drowning the Swine    notwithstanding some think it void of the Face of Justice  Ay ay our  Divines  must allegorise all  Jesus  ' s Miracles or betake themselves to this Opinion of  Victor  which this  freethinking  Age will hardly let them quietly rest in So supposing our  Divines  to be what they generally are still Ministers of the Absurdity of the Letter I pass to the Consideration of the Authority of the Fathers and to see whether we can't learn of them this Parable of the Figtree  Who or what is meant by the Figtree seems not to be agreed among the Fathers or more properly speaking they are not agreed all of them to apply it always to  one and the same Thing Some as  Quid Arbor fici nisi humanam naturam designet  In Homil  xxxi  Gregory  the  Great  say Human Nature or Mankind is typified by the Figtree Others as  In Ficu Synogogae positum Exemplum est  In Loc Matt  St  Hilary  say the  Jewish  Church or State is meant by it Others as  Absit a nobis ut Jesu veniènte ad nos et volente manducare de ficu  Ecclesiae  non inveniatur Fructus in ea  In Matth Tract  xxx  Origen  say it is a Type of the Church of Christ So do the Fathers seem to be divided in their Opinions but it is without any Difference or Inconsistency with each other For as there is according to the Fathers Mystery upon Mystery in all the Actions of  Jesus  so I believe the Figtree here as a Type may be properly enough apply'd to the foresaid three Purposes And if the Fathers had been ask'd their Opinion in this Case I dare say they would have said so too This is certain that  Origen  Pote  autem ficus illa intelligi populus Circumcisionis  Ibid  understands it as applicable to the  Jewish  as well as the  Christian  Church And St  Augustin  as Occasion offers itself takes it in the foresaid three Senses When they understand it as a Type of all Mankind they say that the  three Years  of its Unfruitfulness  are to be interpreted of the  Arbor ficulnea Genus humanum estTriennium autem tria sunt Tempora unum aute Legem alterum sub Lege tertium sub gratia  St Augustin in Serm  cx  three grand Periods  of the World the  one  before the Law of  Moses    another  under the Law and the  third  under the Gospel at the Conclusion of which  third  Period as it was an ancient and common Opinion  Jesus  in Spirit would come to his Figtree of Mankind and animadvert on them for their Unfruitfulness not by any Destruction of human Nature but by a Cessation of its Unfruitful State which then will wither away and be turn'd into a fruitful one against the grand Sabbath or acceptable Year which is the Year signified in the Parable  that it is to be let alone to bring forth Fruit in  They that understand the Figtree as a Type of the  Jewish  State mean by the  three Years Jesus  came to it the  three Years  of his preaching among the  Jews  at the End of which after  Christ  's Passion and Resurrection the  Jewish  State like the Figtree withered away and for its Unfruitfulness was rooted up They that understand the Figtree as a Figure of the Church of  Christ  by the  three Years  mean the apocalyptical  twelve hundred and sixty Days  that is three Years and a half of the Church's barren and unfruitful State in the Wilderness at the Conclusion of which the Fathers say  Jesus  will come again to his Church or Figtree seeking Fruit on it  Some perhaps may be ready here to interpose with a Question and say how will  Jesus  then come to his Church I have carefully perused the Fathers upon this Question and can't find that they mean any more by  Christ  's second or spiritual Advent than that clear  Truth  right  Reason  and divine  Wisdom  which are the mystical Names of  Jesus  will descend upon the Church on the Clouds of the Law and the Prophets to the Removal of her unfruitful and unprofitable Errors and to enable her to bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit against the grand Sabbath Neither can any reasonable Man conceive how otherwise  Jude  ver  the Lord should come  not  with ten thousand of his Saints  as our Translation has it but  that is as  Origen  interprets  in his holy thousands of  Allegorists    to criticise upon all  the Scripture and to convince  Ministers of the Letter  of their  abominable Errors and of their horrid Blasphemies spoken preach'd and printed against the Holy Ghost or Spirit of the Law and Prophets As to that litteral and common PulpitStory with all its Appendages of  Jesus  's second Coming on aetherial Clouds as on a Woolsack in his human tho' glorious and majestick Appearance for the Resurrection of Mens Bodies by Sound of a Trumpet in the Audience of the Dead  c  it is the most absurd nonsensical and unphilosophical such groundless and worthless Stuff have the  Clergy  sold and preach'd to God's People that ever was told against Reason against prophetick and evangelical Scripture and against other ancient and good Authority It is no Place here to multiply Testimonies and Arguments to either of these Purposes which my Readers if they do but attend will see no Occasion for But if our  Divines  should think I have put a false Gloss on the Text of St  Jude  above I have a Bundle of Arguments and Testimonies to produce in Defence of it at their Service  In the Parable of St  Luke  it is said  Lo    these three Years come I seeking Fruit on this Figtree  as if  Jesus  came annually and successively for  three Years  together but according to the Original it ought to be  read  Lo it is three Years and now come  or  Lo the three Years are now past and I come  And here it is to be noted that whether we understand the Figtree as a Figure of the Church in particular or of Mankind in general the mystical Number of  three Years  will terminate about the same Time against the Evangelical Sabbath on which the Unfruitfulness of the Church or of Mandind according to the Fathers is to have an End put to it  And  Jesus  when he came to the Figtree  found nothing thereon but Leaves only  So  Jesus  when he comes to his Church will find nothing in her but Leaves only And what is here meant by Leaves Let the Fathers such as  Inveniet infaecundam foliis tantomodo vestitam id est Verbis inanibus gloriantem sed fructibus vacuam Operibus quippe bonis sterilem  In Loc Matt  St  Hilary  St  John  Habentem folia et non fructus Verba non Sensus Scripturas non intelligentiam Scripturarum  In Loc Marci  of Jerusalem  and  Folia sola habentem hoc est apparentem Litteram non Fructus Spiritus  In Loc Matt  St  Theophylact  tell us who by Leaves understand a vain and empty Appearance of Wisdom and good Works or the Words and Letter of the Scriptures which are the Leaves of the Oracle without any Figs of  spiritual Interpretations of them And wheher this ben't the Case of the Church at present our  Divines  are to consider The Figs that  Jesus  may be supposed to look for at his Coming are not only the Fruits of the Spirit mention'd by St  Paul  but  Quaerens non Sensiles Fructus sed intellectilem ex Lege et Prophetis dulcem{que} Faecundiratem  Caesarii in Dialog    spiritual Interpretations  of the Scriptures which St  Jerome  Ficus sunt dona dulcissima Spiritus Sancti Spiritualia dogmata et Scientia Scripturarum  In Agg  Cap  ii  says are  mystical Figs  because as ripe Figs are sweet to the Palate of our Mouths so are they no less delicious to the Soul of Man  But  Jesus  is said to be  hungry  after Figs so will  Jesus  in Spirit  hunger  for the mystical Figs of his Church that is as  Origen  Esuriit autem Jesus semper in justis volens manducare Fructum Spiritus Sancti in eis  In Matt Tract  XXX  rightly interprets he will earnestly desire like a Man that is hungry the Fruits of the Spirit in his Church which will be as grateful to him as Figs can be to a Man naturally To understand this Expression of  Jesus  's  Hunger  literally is such a mean Circumstance of Life that unless it be what's next to impossible necessarily introductory to some noble Transaction  it's unfit to be remember'd of a Saint in History  Diogenes Laertius  would have disdain'd to mention such a frivolous Circumstance in the Life of a Philosopher as  this  of  Jesus  But if we understand this  Hunger  in  Jesus  mystically and figuratively of his Desires of the Fruits of the Spirit in his Church it is sublime and noble and the Emblem confessedly proper and instructive  But  Jesus  is said to come to the Figtree at an unseasonable Time  For the Time of Figs was not yet  which Expression has been the Perplexity of  Commentators  who with all their Wit and Sagacity can't get well over it I shall not mention here all or any of their pretended Solutions of this Difficulty but let us see whether we can't easily and at once unlose it St  Mark  's Words are  which are and have been commonly translated  for the Time of Figs is not yet  But if we change the  Point  into an  Interrogation  and read thus  for was it not the Time of Figs  the Difficulty vanishes as certainly as that it is absurd to suppose  Christ  should come to his Figtree and look for Fruit when he could not reasonably expect any This my Solution of this Difficulty certainly serves the Purpose of the mystical Interpretation  and if it does not the litteral I answer we are not to heed the Letter which seldom or never has any Sense or Truth in it But by the by it does the litteral too since there are no Grounds from the Text to think what has been the common Opinion that it was about the  Jewish  Passover that  Jesus  came to the Figtree If this my Solution of the Difficulty don't please I must say with  Ad quem Locum intelligendum ut oportet expectandum esse Eliae ut nonnu  quam loquuntur Veteres de Locis obscurissimis Adventum  In Exercitat Sac Lib  ii  cap    Heinsius  that it must be left as a Knot for  Elias  to untie who according to the  Fructus dulces omne genus de arbore Vitae comedendum praebebit Elias  Apud Buxtorf Synag p    ancient  Jews  is first to gather Fruits off this mystical Figtree and present them to the intellectual Taste of Mankind But that my Solution is good will appear by what follows  And  Jesus  finding Leaves only says in St  Matthew  to the Figtree  Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever  which with its parallel Place in St  Mark  is in my Opinion a false Translation The Original is  and ought to be  englished  not as yet  or  not untill now  that I came  against the  grand  Age  of the Sabbath has Fruit grown on thee So that the Miracle of  Jesus  was to make the Figtree of the Church fruitful and if her preceeding unfruitful State which in St  Mark    Jesus  is said to curse or rather to devote to Ruin wasted away it was by Consequence  But what Time of Day was it that  Jesus  came to the Figtree It was in the  Morning  And of what Day That is uncertain as to the Letter but according to the mystical Extent of the  Three Years  whether we understand the Figtree as a Type of the Church or of all Mankind of all Ages it will be on the  Morning  of the great Sabbath when upon the Appearance of the Light of Christ like the Rising of the Sun an unfruitful and erroneous Church must needs wither away And the Disciples on the said  Morning  will as  Origen  Oculis Spiritalibus viderunt Mysterium fici siccatae  Matt Tract  xvi  says with their intellectual Eyes behold her waste with Admiration And then too they under Christ  will do what is done to the Figtree  of the Church and  remove Mountains  of Antichristian Power that exalt themselves against  him as the Fathers interpret and I need not explain  And what is meant by the Means which St  Luke  speaks of to make the Figtree of the Church fruitful on the Sabbatical Year  the Year it is to be let alone to bear Fruit in  There must be  digging about it  that is  Effodientes Literam Legis  Cyril Glaphyr  L P  into the Earth of the Letter of the Scriptures and  dunging  of it that is calling  Mittitur ergo Cophinus Stercoris ad Radicem Arboris quando pravitatis suae Conscientia tangitur memoria Cogitationis  Gregor M in Hom  xxxi  to Remembrance her Sins and Errors of the Time past which rationally speaking will make the Church to bring forth good Fruit  After this Fashion is the rest of the Parable of the Figtree to be allegorized out of the Fathers St  Gregory  Sed hoc significat Ficulnea infructuosa quod Mulier inclinata et hoc Ficulnea reservata quod Mulier erecta Hoc autem et octodecem Annorum Numero signatur quod tertio die Dominus Vineae Ficulneam venisse perhibetur  In Homil  xxxi  the  Great  and St  Augustin  make these two Stories or Parables  viz  of the Figtree and of the Woman with her  Spirit of Infirmity  as they are blended together in St  Luke  to be Figures of the same Mystery The  eighteen Years  of the Woman's Infirmity and the  three Years  of the Figtree's Unfruitfulness they will have to be mystically synchromical And the Woman's  Incurvity  to the Earth is they say significative of the same Thing with the  Unfruitfulness  of the Figtree And the  Erection  of the Woman on the Sabbath is of the same Import with the  Reservation  of the Tree for Fruitfulness on that Day And let any one see if they don't admirally agree as I have interpreted these two Parables  Before I dismiss this Story of the Figtree I can't but adore the Providence of God that the Miracle has been hitherto placed in the withering away of the Tree If the Miracle had been a plain Story of a dead and wither'd Tree's being made to bring forth Leaves and Fruit on a sudden this would have been such a manifestly supernatural Work and so agreeable to modern Notionists about Miracles that Mens Thoughts would have been so absorpt in the Consideration of the Letter as they would never have extended them to the Contemplation of the Mystery And our Divines would have made such a Noise in our Ears of the Excellency and Marvellousness of such a Miracle as that there would be no bearing of it But  But as the  Evangelists  have in a good Measure suppress'd all mention of the after Fruitfulness of the Tree and the Story by Misconstruction is clog'd with the foresaid Difficulties and Absurdities we are of Necessity driven to the search after Mystery for good Sense and Truth in it  And thus have I spoken enough to the Miracle of  Jesus  's cursing the Figtree which according to the Letter is a foolish and absurd Story But the mystical Operation of which the Letter is a Shadow will be ravishing marvelous and stupendous and not only a Proof of  Christ  's Power and Presence in his Church but a Demonstration of his  Messiahship  in as much as an infinite Number of Prophecys upon Prophecys will thereupon be discern'd to be accomplish'd or the Church can't bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit that is Spiritual Interpretations of the Scriptures like ripe Figs And so I pass to an    Eighth  Miracle of  Jesus  and that is  John  Chap v  "of his healing a Man of an Infirmity of thirty eight Years Duration at the Pool of  Bethesda  that had five Porches in which lay a great Multitude of impotent Folk blind halt withered waiting the troubling of the  Waters upon the Descent of an Angel who gave a Sanative Virtue to them to the curing of any one be his Distemper of what kind soever who first stept down into them"  This whole Story is what our Saviour calls a  Camel  of a monstrous Size for Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities which our  Divines  and their implicit Followers of these last Ages have swallowed without chewing whilst they have been straining at  Knats  in Theology and hesitating at frivolous and indifferent Things of the Church of no Consequence  As to  Jesus  's Miracle in this Story which consisted in his healing a Man of no body knows what  Infirmity  there neither is nor can be proved any Thing supernatural in it or there had been an express Description of the Disease without which it is impossible to say there was a miraculous Cure wrought As far as one may reasonably guess this Man's  Infirmity  was more  Lazyness  than  Lameness  and  Jesus  only shamed him out of his pretended Illness by bidding him to take up his Stool and walk off and not lie any longer like a lazy Lubbard and Dissembler among the Diseased who were real Objects of Pity and Compassion Or  if he was no Dessembler he was only fancyfully sick and  Jesus  by some proper and seasonable Talk touch'd his Heart to his Relief and so by the Help of his own Imagination he was cured and went his Way This is the  worst  that can be made of this  infirm  Man's Case and the  best  that can be said of  Jesus  's Power in the Cure of him as will appear by and by upon Examination into it But the other Parts of the Story of the healing Virtue of the Waters upon the Descent of an Angel into them is not only void of all good Foundation in History but is a Contradiction to common Sense and Reason as will be manifest after an Inquiry into the Particulars of it  St  John  was the beloved Disciple of our Lord and I hope he lov'd his Master or he was worse than an Heathen who loves those who love him But this Story and some others that are peculiar to his Gospel such as of  Jesus's telling the Samaritan Woman her Fortune  of  his healing the blind Man with EyeSalve made of Clay and Spittle  Of  his turning Water into Wine for the Use of Men    who had before well drank  and of  his raising Lazarus from the Dead  are enough to tempt us to think that he wilfully design'd either to blast the Reputation of his Master  or to try how far the Credulity of Men who through blind Love were running apace into Christianity might be imposed on or he had never related such idle Tales which if the  Priesthood  who should be the philosophical Part of Mankind had not been amply hired into the Belief of them would certainly have been rejected with Indignation and Scorn before now  St  John  wrote his Gospel many Years after the other  Evangelists  What then should have been his peculiar Business Certainly nothing more than to add some remarkable Passages of Life to  Jesus  's Honour which they had omitted and to confirm the Truths which they had before reported of him But St  John  is so far from doing this that the Stories he has particularly added are not only derogatory to the Honour of  Jesus  but spoil his Fame for a Worker of Miracles which the other  Evangelists  would raise him to By reading the other  Evangelists  one would think that  Jesus  was a Healer of all manner of Diseases however incurable by Art and Nature and that whereever he came all the sick and the maim'd excepting a few Infidels were perfectly cured by him But this Story before us will be like a Demonstration that  Jesus  was no such Worker of Miracles and  Healer of Diseases as he is commonly believed to have been and that he wrought not near the Number of Cures he is supposed to have done much less any great ones The best Conception that an impartial Reader of the Gospel can form of  Jesus  is that he was a tolerable good natural  Orator  and could handsomely harangue the People off hand and was according to the Philosophy of the Times a good  Cabalist  and his Admirers finding him endewed with the Gift of Utterance which was thought by them more than human they fancy'd he must have the Gift of healing too and would have him to exercise it which he did with Success upon the Fancies and Imaginations of many who magnified his divine Power for it And the Apostles afterwards to help forward the Credulity and Delusion of the People amplified his Fame with extravagant Assertions and strange Stories of Miracles passing the Belief of considerate and wise Men Whether this Representation of the Case according to the  Letter  of the Gospels be false and improbable let my  Readers  judge by the Story before us which I come now to dissect and make a particular Examination into the several Parts of it Accordingly it is to be observ'd  First  that this Story of the  Pool  of  Bethesda  abstractedly considered from  Jesus  's Cure of an infirm Man at it has no good Foundation in History It merits no Man's Credit nor will any reasonable Person give any heed to it St  John  is the only Author that has made any mention of this Story and tho' his Authority may be good and better than another Man's in Relation to the Words and Actions of  Jesus  in as much as he was most familiar and conversant with him yet for foreign Matters that have no immediate Respect to  Jesus  's Life he's no more to be regarded than another  Historian  who if he palm upon his  Readers  an improbable Tale of sensless and absurd Circumstances will have his Authority questioned and his Story pry'd into by the Rules of  Criticism  and rejected or received as it is found worthy of Belief and Credit If there had been any Truth in this Story before us I cannot think but  Josephus  or some other  Jewish  Writers it is so remarkable peculiar and astonishing an Instance of the Angelical Care and Love to the distressed of  Jerusalem  would have spoken of it But I don't find they have or our modern  Commentators  would have refer'd to them as to a Testimony of the Credibility of the  GospelHistory  Josephus  has professedly written the History of the  Jewish  Nation in which he seems to omit nothing that makes for the Honour of his Country or for the Manifestation of the Providence of God over it He tells us of the Conversation of Angels with the Patriarchs and Prophets and intermixes ExtraScriptural Traditions as he thought them fit to be transmitted to Posterity How came he then and all other  Jewish  Writers to forget this Story of the Pool of  Bethesda  I think we may as well suppose that a Writer of the natural History of  Somersetshire  would neglect to speak of the medicinal Waters of  Bath  as  Josephus  should omit that Story which if true was a singular Proof of God's distinguishing Care of his peculiar People or an Angel had never been frequently as we suppose sent to this Relief of the Diseased amongst them Is then St  John  's single Authority enough to convey this Story down to us Some may say that there are several Prodigies as well as political Events of ancient Times that tho' they are reported but by one Historian meet with Credit and why may not St  John  's Testimony be equal to another Writer's I grant it and tho' it is hardly probable but that this Story if true before  us must have had the Fortune to be told by others yet St  John  's single Authority shall pass sooner than another Man's if the Matter be in itself credible and well circumstanc'd But were it is blindly Imperfectly and with monstrously incredible Circumstances related like this before us it ought to be rejected Which brings me  Secondly  To ask what was the true Occasion of the Angels Descent into this Pool Was it to wash and bath himself Or was it to impart an healing Quality to the Waters for some one diseased Person The Reason that I ask the first of these two Questions is because some ancient Readings of v say  Vid Milli Nov Test  In Loc  the Angel  was washed  which supposes some bodily Defilement or Heat contracted in the Caelestial Regions that wanted Refrigeration or Purgation in these Waters But how absurd such a Thought is needs no Proof To impart then compassionately an healing Power to the Waters for the Benefit of the Diseased was the sole Design of the Angel's Descent into them And God forbid that any should philosophically debate the Matter and enquire how naturally the Waters deriv'd that Virtue from the Angel's corporal  Presence The Thing was providential and miraculous our  Divines  will say and so let it pass But I may fairly ask why one diseased Person only at a Time reap'd the Benefit Or why the whole Number of impotent Folks were not at once healed I have a notable Answer presently to be given to these Questions but I am afraid beforehand our  Divines  will not approve of it Therefore they are to give one of their own and make the Matter consistent with the Goodness and Wisdom of God or the said Questions spoil the Credit of the Story and make an idle and ridiculous Romance of it And when their Hands are in to make what is impossible a satisfactory Answer to the said Questions I wish that for the sake of  Orthodoxy  they would determine whether the Angel descended with his Head or his Heels foremost or whether he might not come swauping upon his Breast into the Waters like a Goose into a Horsepond But  Thirdly  How often in the Week the Month or the Year did the Angel vouchsafe his Descent into the Pool And for how many Ages before  Christ  's Advent and why not since and even  Quare modo non movetur Aqua St  Ambros de Sacrament Lib C    now  was this Gracious and Angelical Favour granted St  John  should have been particular as to these Points which he could not but know Philosophers would be curious to enquire about If it was but once in the Year as St  Chrysostom  In Serm contra Eberictatem  hints little Thanks are due to him for his Courtesy One would think sometimes that his Descent was frequent or such a Multitude of impotent Folk variously disorder'd had never attended on it And again at other Times one would think that his Descent was seldom or the Diseased as fast as they came which could not be faster than the Angel could dabble himself in the Waters had been charitably dismissed with restor'd Health Here then is a Defect in St  John  's Story and a  Block  at which wise and considerate FreeThinkers will stumble But  Fourthly  How came it to pass that there was not better Care taken either by the Providence of God or of the Civil Magistrates of  Jerusalem  about the Disposal of the Angelical Favour to this or that poor Man according to his Necessities or Deserts But that he who  could fortunately catch the Favour was to have it Just as he who runs fastest obtains the Prize So here the Diseased who was most nimble and watchful of the Angel's Descent and could first plunge himself into the Pool carried off the Gift of Sanation An odd and a merry Way of conferring a divine Mercy And one would think that the Angels of God did this for their own Diversion more than to do good to Mankind Just as some throw a Bone among a Kennel of Hounds for the Pleasure of seeing them quarrel for it or as others cast a Piece of Money among a Company of Boys for the Sport of seeing them scramble for it So was the Pastime of the Angels here It was the Opinion of some Heathens that  Homines sunt Lusus Deorum  the Gods sport themselves with the Miseries of Mankind but I never thought before I considered this Story that the  Angels  of the God of the  Jews  did so too But if they delighted in it rare sport it was to them as could be to a  TownMobb  For as the poor and distressed Wretches were not to be supposed to be of such a polite Conversation as in Complaisance to give place to their betters or in Compassion to make way for the most miserable but upon the Sight  or Sound of the Angel's Fall into the Pool would without Respect of Persons strive who should be first So those who were behind and unlikely to be cured would like an unciviliz'd  Rabble  push and press all before them into it What a Number then of some hundreds perhaps of poor Creatures were at once tumbled into the Waters to the Diversion of the City Mob as well as of God's Angels And if one arose out of it with the Cure of his Disease the rest came forth like drown'd  Rats  to the Laughter of the foresaid Spectators and it was well if there was not sometimes more Mischief done than the healing of  one  could be of Advantage to those People Believe then this Part of the Story let him that can If any Angel was concern'd in this Work it was an Angel of  Satan  who delights in Mischief and if he healed  one  upon such an Occasion he did it by way of Bait to draw others into Danger of Life and Limb But as our  Divines  will not I suppose bear the Thoughts of it's being a bad Angel so I leave them to consider upon our Reasonings whether it was credible that either a good or a bad Angel was concerned and desire them to remember to give me a better Reason why but  one  at a Time was healed  If any Pool or Cistern of Water about this City of  London  was so blessed with the Descent of an Angel to such an End the Magistrates such is their Wisdom would if God did not direct take care of the prudent Disposal of the Mercy to the best Advantage of the Diseased And if they sold it to an infirm  Lord  or  Merchant  who could give for it most Money to be distributed among other Poor and distress'd People would it not be wisely done of them To suppose they would leave the Angelick Favour to the Struggle of a Multitude is absurd and incredible And why then should we think otherwise of the Magistrates of  Jerusalem  Away then with the Letter of this Story And if this be not enough to confute it Then  Fifthly  Let us consider to its farther Confutation who and what were the impotent Folk that lay in the Porches of  Bethesda  waiting the Troubling of the Waters St  John  says they were  Blind    Halt    Withered  and as some Manuscripts  Vid Milli Nov Test  In Loc  have it  Paralyticks  And what did any of these there How could any of them be supposed to be nimble enough of Foot to step down first into the Waters and carry off the Prize of Sanation before  many others of various Distempers Tho' the troubled Waters might be of such medicinal Force as to heal a Man of whatsoever Disease he had yet none of the foresaid Persons for want of good Feet and Eyes could expect the Benefit of it Tho' the Ears of the Blind might serve him to hear when the Angel plump't like a Stone into the Waters yet through want of Sight for the guidance of his Steps he would by others be jostled out of the right Way down into them And if the Lame had good Eyes to discern the the Descent of the Angel yet Feet were all in all to this Purpose Consequently these impotent Folk specified by St  John  might as well have slay'd at Home as resorted to  Bethesda  for Cure I know not what Fools the Diseased of  Jerusalem  of old might be but if there was such a Prize of Health to be strove for by the Distempered of this City I appeal to all Men of common Sense whether the  Blind  the  Lame  the  withered  and  Paralyticks  would offer to put in for it St  John  then forgot himself or else blundered egregiously or put the Banter upon us to try how far an absurd Tale would pass upon the World with Credit There might be if there was any litteral Sense in the Story many of other Distempers but there could  be neither  blind    halt  nor  withered  without  such an Absurdity  as absolutely disparages the Story blasts the Credit of the  Relator  or rather brings to mind the Assertion of St  Ambrose  that the Letter of the  New  as well as the  Old Testament  lies abominably If what I have here said does not overthrow the Letter of this Story Then what I have  Sixthly  To add will do it more effecttually and that is of the  certain Man    that had an Infirmity thirty and eight Years  and lay at this Pool for an Opportunity to be cured of it Tho' these  thirty  and  eight  Years are in our  English  Translation praedicated of this Man's Infirmity yet more truely according to the Original are they spoken of the Time he lay there and the Fathers so understood St  John  's Words What this Man's Infirmity was we are uncertain For  Weakness  or  Infirmity  is a general Name of all Distermpers and may be equally apply'd to one as well as to another Whereupon tho' we can't certainly say from this Man's Infirmity that he was a Fool to lay there so long expecting that Cure which it was impossible for him to obtain yet what he says to our Saviour  I have no Man when the Waters are troubled to put me into the Pool but while I am coming another steppeth down  before me  does imply his Folly sufficiently or rather the Incredibility of the whole Story What then did this  infirm  Man at this Pool if he had neither Legs of his own good enough nor a Friend to assist him in the Attainment of Sanarion Was he not a Fool if it was possible for any to be so great a one for his Patience Would it not have been as wisely done of him to wait in the Fields so long the Falling of the Sky that he might catch Larks The Fathers say this Man's  Infirmity  was the  Palsy  but whether they said so for the Sake of the Mystery or to expose the Letter I know not But that Distemper after  thirty  and  eight  Years Duration and Increase if it was more curable than another at first had in that time undoubtedly so weakened and render'd him uncapable to struggle with others for this Relief that it is without Sense and Reason to think he should wait so long for it Our  Divines  if they so please may commend this Man for his Patience but after a few Years or rather a few Days Experience another Man would have been convinc'd of the Folly and Vanity of his Hopes and returned Home If he could not put in for this Benefit with Prospect of Success in his more youthful Days when the Distemper was young too  much less Reason had he to hope for it in his old Age after  thirty  and  eight Years  Affliction unless he dream'd of what was not to be imagined an Opportunity without Molestation and Competition to go off with it Whatever then our  Divines  may think of this Man and his Patience I will not believe there ever was such a Fool and for this Reason will not suppose St  John  could litterally so romance unless he meant to bambouzle Mankind into the Belief of the greatest Absurdity A Man that Lies with a Grace to deceive others makes his Story so hang together as to carry the Face and Appearance of Truth along with it which this of St  John  that for many Ages has been swallowed for the Reason before us has not But what is the worst of all against this Story is  Seventhly  That which follows and absolutely destroys the Fame and Credit of  Jesus  for a Worker of Miracles  And  V  Jesus went up to Jerusalem where there was by the SheepMarket a Pool called Bethesda having five Porches in which lay a great Multitude of impotent Folk blind halt withered  Why then did not  Jesus  heal them Here was a rare Opportunity for the Display of his Healing and Almighty Power and why  did he not exercise it to the Relief of that Multitude of impotent Folk If he could not cure them there's an End of his Power of Miracles and if he would not it was want of Mercy and Compassion in him Which way soever we take this Case it turns to the Dishonour of the Holy  Jesus  What then was the Reason that of so great a Multitude of diseased People  Jesus  exerted his Power and extended his Mercy on only  one  poor Paralytick St  Augustin  Tot jacebant et unus curatus cum posset uno Verbo omnes erigere Quid ergo intelligendum est nisi quia Potestas et Bonitas illa magis agebat  c In Loc Johan  puts this Question and Objection into my Mouth and tho' neither He nor I start it for the Service of Infidelity but to make Way for the Mystery yet I know not why  Infidels  may not make Use of it till Ministers of the Letter can give a satisfactory Answer and Solution to it  The Evangelists  Matthew    Mark  and  Luke  tell such Stories of  Jesus  's healing Power as would incline us to think he cured all whereever he came He  heal'd  they say  all Manner  of Diseases among the People and they make mention of particular Times and Places where all the Diseased were healed by him which  Assertions imply that  Jesus  's healing Power was most extensive and excepting to an hardhearted and unbelieving  Pharisee  now and then universal so far that it might be question'd whether any died during the Time of his Ministry in the Places where he came And our  Divines  have so harangued on  Jesus  's Miracles as would confirm us in such an Opinion But this Story in St  John  confutes and confounds all St  John  in no Place of his Gospel talks of  Jesus  's healing of many nor of all manner of Diseases much less of all that were Diseased which if it be not like a Contradiction to the other  Evangelists  is some Diminution of their Authority and enough to make us suspect that they stretch'd much in praise of their Master and said more to his Honour than was strictly true But this Place before us is a flat Contradiction to them and  Jesus  is not to be supposed to heal many in any Place much less all manner of Diseases or he had never let such a Multitude of poor Wretches pass without the Exercise of his Power and Pity on them Some good Reason then must be given for  Jesus  's Conduct here and such a one as will adjust it to the Reports of the other Evangelists or  Infidels  will think that either  they romanc'd for the Honour of their Master or that St  John  in Spite told this Story to the Degradation of him I can conceive no better of this Matter according to the Letter  The  Bishop  of  Lichfield  very remarkably says  Defence of Christianity P  that Jesus whereever he went healed all that came to home without Distinction the important halt withered  He certainly had this Text of St  John  in his Eye when he said so because  Impotent    Halt    Withered  are only mention'd here where Jesus cured  none  of them Whereupon if his  Lordship  had made but a marginal Reference to this Text it would have been the best Jest and Banter with a Sneer that ever was put upon  Jesus  and his Power of Miracles As it is it's a very good one and I desire my Readers to take Notice of it that his Lordship may not lose the Credit and Praise of it It's sor such Circumspection of Thought Exactness of Expression and Acuteness of Wit that I admire that  Prelate  and must needs say of him whether he ever be translated to  Canterbury  or  York  or not that he's an  arch  Bishop  But to return and go on The Conduct of  Jesus  to all Appearance is not only blameable his Power of healing disputable and his Mercy indefensible for that he cured but  one  infirm Man out of a Multitude at  Bethesda  but  Eightly  and lastly it may reasonably be questioned whether he wrought any Miracle in the healing of this  one  Man Miracles to say nothing of the ridiculous Distinction between divine and diabolical ones are Works done out of the Course of Nature and beyond the Imitation of human Art of Power Now whether the Cure of this infirm Man can be brought under this Definition of a Miracle may be doubted What this Man's  Infirmity  which is a general Name for all Distempers was we know not How then can we say he was miraculously cured unless we knew his Disease to be incurable by Art which none can affirm The worst that we know of this Man's Case is that it was of a long Continuance no less than of  eight  and  thirty  Years And the  Bishop  of  Lichfield  and others in their florid Harangues of  Jesus  's Works make the Cure of such Chronical Diseases to be miraculous But why so Many Instances may be given of Infirmities of human Nature of a long Duration  which in Time and especially in old Age wear off If such Infirmites don't occur to the Memory of our  Divines  I could put them in Mind of them And who knows but this was the Case of this impotent Man whose Infirmity  Jesus  observing to be wearing off bid him to be gone and take up his Couch for he would soon be made whole  The Fathers indeed call this Man's Infirmity the  Palsy  which in truth is generally worse than better by Time and after  thirty  and  eight  Years must needs be very deplorable and incurable without a Miracle But why do they call it the Palsy They have no Authority for it from the Text without which as our litteral  Doctors  will not subscribe to their Opinions in other Cases so why should I here In short the Fathers had never call'd it the  Palsy  but for the sake of the Mystery and I am not bound to own  that  to have been the Distemper any more than it was want of Legs for that would be making of Miracles for  Jesus  without Reason and Authority  If  Jesus  here had healed the whole  Multitude of impotent Folk  without Enquiry what Numbers there might be of them I should have believed that he wrought there many great Miracles in as  much as in such a great Multitude there must needs in all Probability be some incurable by Art or Nature But since he cured only this  one  Man it affords Matter of Speculation whether he was the  most  or the  least  diseased amongst them Our  Divines  for the sake of the Miracle may possibly suppose him to be the most grieviously afflicted of any but  Infidels  on the other hand will say not so but with their Cavils will urge that this infirm Man was either a Dissembler whom  Jesus  shamed out of his pretended Disease or that he was only hippish and fancyfully more than really distemper'd of a long Time whom  Jesus  by suitable Exhortations and Admonitions working upon his Imagination persuaded into a Belief of his Cure and bid him to walk off Certain it is that  Infidels  will say it was not a Power of Miracles in  Jesus  which heal'd him or he had used it then and there for the Sanation of others also  And thus have I finish'd my Invective against the Letter of this Story which if any are offended at they enjoy what is the most reasonable Thing in the World the same Liberty to write for the Letter which I have used against it And so I pass to the Consideration of the Opinions  and Expositions of the Fathers on this strange Story  The Fathers upon whose Authority I form'd my preceding Invective against the Letter so universally betake themselves to the mystical Interpretation of this Story that it may be question'd whether any of them more than myself believ'd any Thing at all of the Letter of it St  Chrysostom  who is as much a litteral Interpreter of the Scriptures as any of them here intirely discards the Letter saying admirably thus  Quis hic Curationis modus quid ho cnobis mysterium significatur non  nec  haec sed futura nobis tanquam imagine et figura quadam describuntur ne res nimium incredibilis et in expectata accedente fidei Virtute Multitudinis  offenderet  In Loc Johan  what a strange Way and Story of healing the Diseased is here but what is the Mystery of it that we are to look to The Matter could not be so simply and unadvisedly transacted litterally as it is related There must be somewhat future here as by a Type and Figure signify'd    or the Story it is so incredible in itself will give Offence to many  St  Chrysostom  was certainly in the right on't and I wonder for which no Reason but want of Liberty can be  given that  Infidels  have not before now with their Jests and Cavils ridiculed this Story St  Augustin  to the same Purpose says  Aqua turbatacredas hoc Angelica Virtute fieri solere non tamen sine significante aliquo Sacramento  In Loc Johan  Can any one believe that these Waters of Bethesda were wont to be troubled in this Fashion and that there was not Mystery and a spiritual Signification in it  Yes I could tell St  Augustin  that our modern  Divines  seem to believe it tho' he if he was now alive would laugh at them for it But to come to the profound Mystery signified by this Story which to use the Words of  Cujus Rei et cujus signi profundum mysterium quantum Dominus donare dignatur loquar ut potero  Ibid  St  Augustin  as God shall enable me I will now speak to  Our  English  Version says  There is at Jerusalem by the SheepMarket    a Pool  How our  Translators  came by the Notion of a  Market  here I can't imagine since there is nothing to favour it in the Original which stands thus  By  the Fathers understand  Piscina illa Baptismum designat  Theophyl In Loc  Quaenam igitur haec descriptio Futurum erat Baptisma plenum maximae Potestatis et Gratiae purgaturum peccata  Chrysost in Loc  Baptism or the spiritual  Laver  of Regeneration and who is that for but the Flock of Christ signified by  So we have another and clearer Interpretation of these two Words And as to  Bethesda  that is a mystical Name of the Church which according to the Signification of  Bethesda  is the House of Grace And if it is said to be at  Jerusalem  it is not to be understood of the Old  Jerusalem  but of the  New  and Apostolical  Jerusalem  at the Entrance into which the Flock of Christ will be baptiz'd by the Waters of the Spirit as in mystical Laver  Bethesda  is said to have five  Porches  that is as the Fathers  Per quinque Porticus quinque Libros Mosis intelligo St  Theophil Antioch in Loc  Quinque Porticus sunt quinque Libri Mosis St  August in Loc  agree the five Books of  Moses  which are as so many Doors of Entrance into the House of Wisdom or of the Grace of  Christ  At these  five Porches  of the five Books of Moses lay  a great Multitude of impotent Folk blind halt withered  And who are these mystically The ignorant erroneous and unstable in Faith and Principle as the Fathers often understand them spiritually And what is the Reason of these their mystical Diseases Because as  St  Augustin  Mosis quinque Libros scripsit sed in quinque Porticibus Piscinam cingentibus languidi jacebant et curari non poterant Vide quomodo manet littera convincens eum non salvans iniquum Illis enim quinque Porticibus in figura quinque Librorum prodebantur potius quam sinabantur aegroti Ergo quicunque amatis litteram sine gratia in Porticibus remanebitis aegri eritis jacentes non convalescentes de littera enim praesumitis  In Psal  lxx  and other Fathers say they rest on the Letter of the Law which throws them into various Errors like Diseases of different Kinds of which they can't be cured without the Descent of the Spirit like an Angel to instruct them mystically to interpret  With these impotent Folk lay  a certain Man who had an Infirmity  And who is this infirm Man Mankind in general say St  Cyril  Est Figura Populi in ultimis temporibus sanandi  In Loc Johan  and  Languidus ille de quo in Evangelio legimus quia jacebat Typum Generis humani habere videbatar  In Serm  cclxxiv  Append  St  Augustin  And what is his Infirmity The Fathers call it the  Paralyticum qui juxta Natatoriam jacebat  Irenaei Lib  ii Cap  Palsy  because of his Instability and Unsteadiness in Faith and Principles which is now the Case of of Mankind St  John  calls it  a Weakness  which being a general Name  of all Distempers we can't guess what might be here the specifical one But reasonably speaking according to the Rule of Interpretation this Man's  Infirmity  is the same with the Woman's  Spirit of Infirmity  and that is a Weakness at the Spirit of Prophecy which Mankind as well as the Woman of the Church is to be cured of in the Perfection of Time  And how long did this Man with his Infirmity lay in these Porches of  Bethesda Thirty eight Years  So has Mankind with his Weakness at the Spirit of Prophecy lay eight and thirty hundred  Tempus et Annus sunt centum Anni  Tichonii in Reg      Years reckoning two thousand under the Law and eighteen hundred since under the Gospel St  Augustin  Quod autem triginta et octo Annos in Languoribus positus erat do illo Quadraginta numero quem supra diximus duo minus habens et quae sunt ista duo nisi duo praecepta dilectio Dei et Proximi Ista duo in quibus tota Lex pendet et Prophetae si non habuerit languidus et Paralyticus jacet  In Ps  lxxxiii  has an ingenious and more mystical way of Computation of these  thirty and eight Years  which pleases me too but possibly some Readers may not so easily apprehend it unless they are well acquainted with the Mystery of Prophetical Numbers  And how is Mankind to be cured of his Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy By being instructed by the Spirit of Truth who is to come at the Conclusion of the said thirty and eight mystical Years  to arise and take up his bed and walk  that is to raise his Thoughts to the Contemplation of the divine Mysteries of the Law and to lift up his Bed of the Letter on which he has hitherto  rested  into a sublime Sense and then he will walk uprightly and steadily in the Faith without wavering like a Paralytick  And at what Season did  Jesus  come to this infirm Man It was at a Feast of the  Jews    Irenaeus    Chrysostom    Theophylact  and  Cyril  call it the Feast of Penticost And the grand Feast of Penticost is as St  Cyril  Quod autem sub finem Hebdomadum Sanctae Pentecostes ipse revertitur Hierosolymam figuratè et aenigmatice significat futurum nostri Salvatoris Reversionem ultimis praesentis aevi temporibus  In Loc Johan  says upon the Place at the Perfection of Time the Time of the Evangelical Sabbath and of  Jesus  's spiritual Advent which will be a Time of feasting on intellectual and divine Mysteries of seeing Visions and of dreaming Dreams consequently at that Time as the ancient  Jews  and Fathers assert Mankind will be cured of this Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy  And this too is the  certain Season that the Angel will descend and trouble the Waters  By Angel is here meant  Turbabat Angelusdictus est Dominus magni consilii Angelus  Augustin in Serm  cxxv  Sect    the Spirit of Christ And by Waters the Fathers understand  Turbavit Aquam id est turbavit Populum  Ejusdem in Ps  cii  the People of all Nations But how will the Descent of the Spirit of Truth like an Angel trouble these Waters that is give any Molestations and Disturbance to the People Is there not a Mistake in the Oracle If the  Clergy  will be but greater Lovers of Truth than of their Interests if they who should be Teachers of Forbearance of one another in Love will but keep their Temper there would be found a mistake in it But alas  Lastly  The  Jews  as is intimated seem to have been mov'd with Indignation at the Cure of the infirm Man saying to him v  it is the Sabbath it is not lawful for thee to carry thy Bed  which litterally could not be true The  Jews  were not such precise Observers of the Sabbath nor  so stupid and foolish  as St  Cyril    Sabbatum est et Grabatum non licet tollere Quid stupidius aut inertius esse potest  In Loc Johan  says as to  think the taking up and carrying a Stool to be a Breach of it But mystically it is to be fear'd this will be most true and that the  Clergy  who would be  Jews  inwardly and the Circumcision in Spirit will be bitter Enemies to Man's Exaltation of his Couch of the Letter of the Scriptures on or against the Evangelical Sabbath and will make it if possible an  unlawful  Work because it will bring to them Shame Dishonour and Loss of Interests along with it  After this Manner is every other Circumstance of this Story to be allegorically apply'd out of the Fathers The Moral or Mystery of the whole in short is this that at the Perfection of Time signified by the  Sabbath  the  Pentecost  the End of  thirty eight Years  the Spirit of Truth will descend on Mankind to their Illumination in Prophecy and to the healing of their  Errors  call'd  Diseases  which is admirably represented by the Parable before us that according to the Letter has neither Reason nor common Sense in it  And thus have I spoken to  eight  of the Miracles of  Jesus  and whether I have not shew'd them in whole or Part according to the Proposition before us to  consist of Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities and whether they are not prophetical and parabolical Narratives of what will be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by  Jesus  I appeal to my  Readers  After another Discourse of some other Miracles I intend to take into Examination the several Stories of  Jesus  's raising of the Dead as of  Lazarus    Jairus  's Daughter and the Widow's Son of  Naim  which reputedly are  Jesus  's grand Miracles but for all the seeming Greatness and Excellency of them I don't doubt but to give the Letter of these Stories a Toss out of the Creed of a considerate and wise Man at least show their Insufficiency for the Purpose for which they have been hitherto apply'd And if I should afterwards by the Leave and Patience of the  Bishop  of  London  give my Objection against  Christ  's Resurrection a Review and some more Force then what will become of the Argument of  Christ  's Power Authority and  Messiahship  from his Miracles  But besides  Jesus  's Miracles I am as Opportunity serves to take into Consideration some of the Historical Parts of his Life and shew them to be no less senseless absurd and ridiculous than his Miracles  And why may I not sometimes treat on the Parables of  Jesus  and show what nonsensical and absurd Things they are according to the Expositions of our most famous Commentators of these last Ages  Jesus  was certainly the absolute and most consummate Perfection of a  Cabalist    Mystist  a  Parabolist  and  Enigmatist  but according to modern Commentaries and Paraphrases he was the merest Ideot and Blockhead that ever open'd his Mouth in that sort of Learning to the Instruction of Mankind And I am oblig'd a little to speak to the Absurdities of  Christ  's Doctrine and Parables because one Article of the Prosecution against me was for saying  that any of the Philosophers of the Gentiles  or  any rational Man  meaning according to modern Expositions  would make a better Teacher than Jesus was  What a great deal of Work have I upon my Hands which if God spare my Life and Health I intend to go on with If what I have already done in it be not acceptable to the  Clergy  their Way to prevent the Prosecution of this great Undertaking is to battle me upon what's past Who knows but they may write if they would try their Strength so acutely in Defence of the Letter of  Jesus  's Miracles already discuss'd as may effectually  stop my Mouth and prevent my giving them any more Trouble of this Kind And I suppose I have now gotten an Adversary in the  Bishop  of St  David  's Who has already discharg'd one Fool's Bolt at me  There has nothing been a more common Subject of Declamation among the the  Clergy  than the  Reasonableness  of Christianity which must be understood of the History of  Christ  's Life and Doctrine or the Application of the Word  Reasonableness  to the Christian Religion is impertinent But if I proceed as I have begun in this Work I shall shew Chistianity as it is understood to be the most unreasonable and absurd Story that ever was told and our modern Systems of Theology groundless and sensless in almost every Part of them  Mahometanism  without Offence be it spoken is a more  reasonable  Religion than the Christian upon modern  Schemes  and  Systems  If what I here say is offensive to our  Divines  the  Press  is open for them as well as for myself and they may if they can shew their Resentment of it Thanks unto God and our most excellent Civil Government for such a Liberty of the  Press  A Liberty that will lead and conduct us to the Fountain of Wisdom and Philosophy which Restraint is a downright Enemy  to And that this Blessing of Liberty may be continued for all  Bishop Smalbrook  and Dr  Rogers's Hobbism  is I dare say the Desire of the curious inquisitive and philosophical Part of Mankind If this Liberty should be taken away what a notable Figure will our  Divines  make from the  Press  and  Pulpit  declaming on the Reasonableness Excellency and Perfection of the Christian Religion without an Adversary and telling their Congregations that all their bitterest and acutest Enemies can object is clearly answered  The  Press  of late Years has been productive of so many cogent and persuasive Arguments for Liberty of debate and the Advocates for this Liberty in the Judgment of the impartial and considerate have so far gotten the better of their Adversaries that I wonder any one can appear in behalf of Persecution If I was a  Bishop  or  Doctor  in  Divinity  I shoud think it a Disgrace to my Station and Education to ask the Assistance of the Civil Authority to protect my Religion I should judge my self unworthy of the Wages and Emoluments I enjoy'd for the Preaching and Propagation of the Gospel if I was unable to give an Answer to any one that ask'd a Reason of my Faith Or if I was so Shallowpated as to  think Heresie and Infidelity punishable by the Civil Magistrate I should think myself as much oblig'd to confute by  Reason  as he is to punish by the  Sword  If the  Bishop  of  London  had taken this Course with me if he had publish'd a Refutation of my supposed Errors as well as endeavour'd at a Prosecution of me for them I had forgiven him the Wrongs and Injuries done me and made no repeated Demands of Satisfaction for them  Christianity is as I believe founded on a Rock of Wisdom and what's more has an omnipotent and omniscient God on its Side who can incline the Hearts of Men to believe and open the Eyes of their Understanding to discern the Truth of it consequently there can be no Danger in the Attempts of our Adversaries whether  Jews    Turks  or Domestick  Infidels  against it But Persecution implys Weakness and Impotency in God to defend his own Cause or his Priests would not move for the Help of the Arm of Flesh in Vindication of it And if at this Time of Day after so many Treatises of  lnfidels  and some of them as yet unanswered against our Religion this good Cause should be taken out of the Hands of God and committed to the Care of the  Civil Magistrate if instead of Reason the Clergy should have Recourse to Force what will Bystanders and even Wellwishers to Christianity say Nothing less than that  Infidels  had gotten the better of  Christ  's Ministers and beaten them at their own Weapons of Reason and Argument  The two great Pleaders for Persecution to the Disgrace of themselves and Dishonour of our Religion that have lately arose are Dr  Rogers  and the  Bishop  of St  David  's Dr  Rogers  's chief Reason against Liberty of Debate is because as he says it is pernicious to the Peace and Welfare of the Community by unsettling the Minds of the People about the Religion established But here's no Consequence unless it could be proved that such as the great Mr  Grounds  and Mr  Scheme  have it in their Hearts to raise Mobbs upon the Government and to beat out the Brains of the  Clergy  All the Harm or rather Good they aim at is to exercise the Wits of the  Clergy  with their Doubts and Objections and if the Passions of our  Ecclesiasticks  are not raised upon it to the doing of Violence to these  Gentlemen  the Peace of the Publick will never de disturb'd As to myself tho' I have a vast and numerous Party on  my Side no less than all the Fathers and primitive Christians for some Ages yet as we were peaceable and quiet Subjects of old and passively obedient to the  Emperors  of  Rome  so we will continue to the Civil Authority of this Nation We only take the Liberty to awaken the Clergy out of a Lethargy of Dulness and Ignorance and hope the Civil Magistrate will consider the Goodness and Charity of our Intentions and guard us against their Insults for it  The  Bishop  of St  David  's  Sermon before the Society for Reformation  c  p  says "It is absurd to assert that the Liberties of any Nation will allow with Impunity a Set of distinguish'd Infidels to insult and treat with the greatest Contempt and Scorn the most sacred and important Truths that are openly professed by the whole Body of the People of whatever Denomination" By a Set of Infidels I suppose he means me and the Fathers And by  treating with Contempt and Scorn the most sacred and important Truths  he means our burlesquing bantering and ridiculing the  Clergy  for their Ministry of the Letter And for  this  he would I conceive have incensed the  Societies  for Reformation of Manners to a Prosecution of me And if they had not  been wiser and more merciful than their Preacher I must have gone to Pot But why should the  Bishop  dislike this way of Writing Don't he know that the Fathers of the Church used to jest and scoff at the  Gentiles  and their Priests for their foolish Superstitions Don't he know that our  Reformers  banter'd and ridicul'd Popery out of Doors and almost within the Memory of Man it was reckon'd but a dull Sermon that was not well humm'd for its Puns and Jests on the Papists why then should the  Bistop  be against that way of writing which was of good Use to the  Reformers  and first  Christians  The grand Subject for  Burlesque  and  Banter  in my Opinion is  Infidelity  and that  Bishop  who can't break two Jests upon  Infidels  for their one upon Christianity has but a small Share of Wit The Christian Religion according to the  Bishop  will abide the Test of calm and sedate Reasoning against it but can't bear a Jest O strange  But to leave these two Contenders for Persecution to the Chastisement of acuter Pens What I have here pleaded for Liberty is not through any Fears of Danger to myself but for the Love of Truth and Advancement of Christianity which without it can't be defended propagated and  sincerely embraced And therefore hope that the Controversy before us between  Infidels  and  Apostates  will be continued by the Indulgence of the Government till Truth arises and shines bright to the Dissipation of the Mists of Error and Ignorance like the Light of the Sun to the Dispersion of the Darkness of the Night I will by God's Leave go on to bear my part in the Controversy And if it was not more against the Interests than Reason of the  Clergy  to believe me would again solemnly declare that what I do in it is with a View to the Honour of  Jesus  our spiritual  Messiah  to whom be Glory for ever Amen  FINIS
