 Who's the Dupe A FARCE As it is ACTED at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  By Mrs COWLEY AUTHOR of the RUNAWAY a COMEDY  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY L DAVIS W OWEN S CROW∣DER T LONGMAN T CADELL T BECKET and Messrs CARNAN and NEWBERY MDCCLXXIX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Reader will find Passages in the following Scenes which are not spoken on the Stage Actors of skill and ability ac∣quainted with the ideas of the Writer and assisted by all the advantages of Stagerepre∣sentation give impressions of character and situation with more expedition and certainty than can be done by Words alone elucida∣tions which may be necessary for the Reader are therefore very frequently and properly omitted by them  The Author owes too much to the very excellent manner in which the Farce is acted not to seize this opportunity of acknow∣ledging her obligations to the Performers  Judging from her own experience as well as her observation on that of others she feels that Authors are so far from having reason to join in the common clamour on the declension  of the Stage that there has been no period in which performances in the Comic line have been represented with such uniform strength and though it is impossible for her to form distinctions on the merit of so perfect a repre∣sentation yet she cannot omit expressing her particular obligations to Mr King for accept∣ing from the best motives and in the most polite and candid manner a part not perfectly agreeable to himself but which owes its effect principally to his performance  CHARACTERS OF THE DRAMA  MEN  DOILEY  Mr  Parsons  SANDFORD  Mr  Aickin  GRANGER  Mr  Palmer  GRADUS  Mr  King  WOMEN  ELIZABETH  Mrs  Brereton  CHARLOTTE  Mrs  Wrighten  The AUTHOR was disappointed of a promised  Pro∣logue  The following was sketched the evening pre∣vious to the representation of the Farce but not spoken on account of the length of the several enter∣tertainments on that nightIt is printed as an explanation of the principal idea on which the plot was formed  IN days of yore liv'd doughty Knights  Enchanters 'Squires and valiant Wights  Scamp'ring o'er mountains seas and land  Prompt at their haughty Fair's command  Castles were raz'd and Giants kill'd  Volcanos sunk or Rivers fill'd  No Ravisher dar'd stalk the earth  No faithless Lover turn'd to mirth  The oaths his fondness once had swore  Is he inconstantHe's  no more  Rare times were these yet some there were  Who even then against the Fair  Fearless of Conj'rer 'Squire or Knight  Could shew their teeth and vent their spight  These were your Learned Menyour  Writers  Whom no age ever mark'd for Fighters  But war with  Women  they could wage  And fill their bold satyric page  With petty foibles  Ladies  faults  Who still endure their rude assaults  For even now it is the way  In this our polish'd modern day  On Female Follies to be witty  From the Court Beauty to the City  Those who can't rhyme in weighty Prose  Their  whims  and  vanity  expose  In Epigrams Sir Witling's folio  Makes of the sex a perfect olio  Of noise caprice and pride compos'd  To ev'ry thing  outré  dispos'd  Whilst Cards and Dress and studied Airs  More than good Housewifery or Prayers  Engross their time their hearts their cares  Thus have they borne from distant ages  The lash of Wit the frown of Sages  Sure then 'tis fair  one  hour to give  'Tis all she asksa Woman leave  To laugh at those same  learned  Men  The gall of whose sarcastic pen  By Youth and Beauty is supply'd  Nor spares the Matron Maid nor Bride  If any from the musty Halls  Or the chill gloom of Collegewalls  To bask in Pleasure's tempting ray  Have Phaëtonlike obtain'd a day  And thron'd in yonder circle sit  Deciding on the claims of Wit  Think not that  you  our Author means  When thro' her saucy Farcic scenes  A Pedant she has dar'd to scan  From Alma Materspick and span  No in her name she bids me swear  You  are chief fav'rites of the Fair  You've blood and spirits in your veins  And give  geheup  to joy the reins  Skim Life's sweet surface and pursue  The flying blessings still in view  For Pleasure ever on the beat  And  roasted  SQUARE CAPSthink a treat  WHO'S THE DUPE  ACT

Grang  Then your letter and I jostled each other at two o'clock on this side Hounslow My damn'd postillionnodding I suppose over the charms of some Greasalindarun against the lettercart tore off my hind wheel and I was forced to mount his oneey'd hack and in that curious equipage arrived at three this morning  Sand  But how has the negotiation with your Brother ended Will he put you in a situation to  Grang  Yes to take a sweating with the Gentoos He'll speak to Sir Jacob Jaghire to get me a commission in the EastIndies  "and you know every body grows rich thereand then you know you're a Soldier you can fight"  In a tone of mimickry  Sand  Well what answer did you give him  Grang  Yes Sir Bobby I can fight  mimicking  but I can't grow rich upon the smell of gun∣powder Your true  EastIndia  Soldier is a dif∣ferent genius from those who strew'd Minden with Frenchmen and must have as great a fe∣cundity of character as a Dutch Burgomaster Whilst his sword is in his hand his pen must be in his cockade he must be as expert at Frac∣tions as at Assaults today mowing down ranks of soft Beings just risen from their Embroidery tomorrow selling Pepper and Beetlenutthis hour a Son of Mars striding over heaps of slain the next an Auctioneerknocking down Chintz and Callico to the best bidder  Sand  And thus your negotiation ended  Grang  Except that I was obliged to listen to some very wise dissertation about  running out  as he calls it  "Five Thousandenough for any younger Son but the Prodigal"  mimicking  Really Sandford I can't see how I could help it Jack Spiller to

America with the distresses of my fellow Soldiers have swallowed the rest  Sand  Poor Granger So with a spirit to do honour to Five Thousand a year thou art not worth Five Shillings  Grang  C'est vrai  Should my affairs with Elizabeth be cross'd I am the most undone Dog on earth  Sand  Now tell me honestly is it Elizabeth or the fortune which is your object  Grang  Why look'ee Sandford I am not one of those sighing Milksops who could live in a cottage on love or sit contentedly under a hedge and help my wife to knit stockings but on the word of a Soldier I had rather marry Elizabeth Doily with Ten Thousand Pounds than any other woman on earth with an Hundred  Sand  And the woman must be very unreason∣able who would not be satisfied with such a distinction But do you know that Elizabeth's Father has taken the liberty to chuse a Soninlaw without your permission  Grang  Ha a Lover That then is the secret my Charmer hinted and which brought me so hastily to Town Whowhat is he  Sand  Every thing that you are not  Grang  There is such a mixture of jest and earnest  Sand  Upon my soul 'tis confoundedly seriousSince they became my neighbours in Suffolk I am in the secrets of the whole

world believes  Miss Doil  To what purpose Sir  Grad  PurposePurpose Madam Why really Miss our Booksellers shelves are loaded with volumes in the unfruitful road of plain sense and nature and unless an Author can clance himself from the common track he stands as little chance to be known as a Comet in its Aphelion Pray Ma'am amuse yourself  Miss Doil  O Lord Sir you may as well offer me a sheet of HieroglyphicsBesides I hate reading  Grad  Hate reading  Miss Doil  Aye to be sure what's reading good for but to give a stiff embarrassed air It makes a man move as if made by a Carpenter who had forgot to give him joints  observing him  he twirls his hat and bites his thumb whilst his hearershis  beholders  I mean are gaping for his wit  Grad  The malicious creature 'Tis my pic∣ture she has been drawing and now 'tis more impossible for me to speak than ever  Miss Doil  For my partfor my part if I was a Man I'd study only Dancing and BonMots With no other learning than these he may be

compliments Instead of be∣ing gallant they were brave instead of Flattery they studied Virtue and Wisdom It was  these  Madam that nerved the Roman arm that em∣powered her to drag the nations of the world at her chariotwheels and that raised her to such an exalted height  Miss Doil  That down she tumbled in the dustand there I beg you'll leave her Was ever any thing so monstrous I ask for a Compliment and you begin an Orationan oration on a par∣cel of stiff Warriors and formal Pedants Why Sir there is not one of these brave wise god∣like Men but would appear as ridiculous in a Modern Assembly as a Judge in his long wig and a Maccaroni jacket  Grad  Now I am dumb again Oh that I had you at Brazennose MadamI could manage you there  Aside  Miss Doil  What now you're in the pouts Sir 'Tis mighty well Bless us what a life a Wife must have with such a Being forever talk∣ing sentences or else in profound silence No delightful nonsense no sweet triflingall must be solemn wise and grave Hang me if I would not sooner marry the Bust of Seneca in bronzethen I should have all the gravity and coldness of Wisdom without its impertinence  Grad  The impertinence of WisdomSurely Madam

to me the very Apex of human felicity I found that word for him in a book of Geometry this morning  Aside  Grad  Indeed  Charl  Positively I have listened to your con∣versation and I can't help being concerned that Talents which ought to do you honour should  by your mismanagement be converted into downright ridicules  Grad  This Creature is of a genus quite dif∣ferent from the other She has

it by in lavender for your Grandson's christeningand here's cambrick enough in your ruffles to make his shirt  Grad  I perceive my error The votaries of Love commence a new childhood and dignity would be as unbecoming in them as a hornpipe to a SocratesBut habit is so strong that to gain an Empress I could not assume that careless air that promptness of expression  Char  Then you may give up the
