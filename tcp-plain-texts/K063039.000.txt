 HENRY AND EMMA A NEW POETICAL INTERLUDE ALTERED FROM PRIOR'S NUT BROWN MAID WITH ADDITIONS AND A NEW AIR AND CHORUS THE MUSIC BY DR ARNE As Performed on WEDNESDAY APRIL AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF MRS HARTLEY  LONDON Sold by T DAVIES in RUSSELSTREET COVENTGARDEN and all the Booksellers in Town and Country Price SIXPENCE  ADVERTISEMENT  IT needs the most humble apology from the Compiler of this little Interlude for the liberties he has taken with a Poem so universally and justly admired The different prunings which he judged necessary for his purpose were as sensibly lamented by the hand that performed them as they can possibly be by the most zealous advocate for the ingenious PRIOR These however with various other alterations far from being the result of selfconsequence arose from absolute necessity in order to give the whole an appearance somewhat conformable to the laws of our drama It was therefore found expedient likewise to introduce the two new though trifling characters of VENUS and EUGENIUS and to conclude the whole with an AIR and CHORUS which are here tacked to the piece with every conviction in the breast of the author for his presumption  A transposition of some lines an occasional addition of others some variation of the personal pronouns c were judged proper to accommodate the performers and prepare the piece for stage representation  Under these circumstances it is hoped that this temporary sacrifice of PRIOR will be candidly overlooked by the Public since it was made but to assist in some measure the modest merit of MRS HARTLEY and to gratify no other desire in the COMPILER  April    th    PERSONS OF THE DRAMA  HENRY  MR SMITH  EUGENIUS  MR HULL  EMMA  MRS HARTLEY  VENUS  MISS BROWN  CHORUS c c  HENRY AND EMMA A NEW POETICAL INTERLUDE c  SCENE  A moon light view of an extensive forest  EUGENIUS  entering alone  NIGHT silent reigns the world in sleep is laid  Save HENRY tortur'd for his  Nut Brown Maid  He wretched slave to love's corroding fears  Greets solemn midnight with his manly tears  And clad in false attire with borrow'd name  Now meets the lovely object of his flame  From prattling infancy I train'd his mind  To honor's call and virtues most refin'd  Now soft repose his troubled breast forsakes  Of every pang my sympathy partakes  Tho' full of years I watch his sorrowing way  And strive to guide him by calm reason's ray  Led by the moon's pale lamp thro' yonder grade  The anxious lovers seek this beachen shade  Their converse trying to fair  Emma  's heart  A fiction plann'd by Love's and  Henry  's art  With wishes rais'd with jealousies opprest  Alternate tyrants of the human breast  By one great trial he resolves to prove  The faith of woman and the force of love  If scanning  Emma  's virtues he shall find  That beauteous frame enclose a steady mind  He'll fix his hope of future joy secure  And live a slave to Hymen's happy pow'r  But if the fair one as he fears is frail  Light fly her merits and her faults prevail  His mind he vows to free from am'rous care  Resume his arms and shine again in war  But softtheir mournful accents speak them nigh  In spight of fond affection I must fly  May no curs'd daemon o'er their mind prevail  But every thought be weigh'd in virtue's scale    Exit  Enter  HENRY  and  EMMA  HENRY  Sincere O tell me hast thou felt a pain  Emma  beyond what woman knows to feign  Has thy uncertain bosom ever strove  With the first tumults of a real love  If so with pity view my wretched state  At least deplore and then forget my fate  To some more happy knight reserve thy charms  By fortune favour'd and successful arms  For lo these hands in murther are imbru'd  These trembling feet by justice are pursu'd  And I this night must fly from thee and love  Condemn'd in lonely woods a banish'd man to rove  EMMA  What is true passion if unblest it dies  And where is  Emma  's joy if  Henry  flies  If love alas be pain the pain I bear  No thought can figure and no tongue declare  Oh cease then coldly to suspect my love  And let my deed at least my faith approve  Alas no youth shall my endearments share  Nor day nor night shall interrupt my care  Nor to hard banishment shall  Henry  run  While careless  Emma  sleeps on beds of down  View me resolv'd where'er thou lead'st to go  Friend to thy pain and partner of thy woe  Blest when my dangers and my toils have shewn  That I of all mankind could love but thee alone  HENRY  Let prudence yet obstruct thy vent'rous way  And take good heed what men will think and say  That full of youthful blood and fond of man  You to the woodland with an exile ran  Reflect that lessen'd fame is ne'er regain'd  And virgin honour once is always stain'd  Timely advis'd the coming evil shun  Better not do the deed than weep it done  No penance can absolve our guilty fame  Nor tears that wash out sin can wash out shame  EMMA  Let  Emma  's hapless case be falsely told  By the rash young or the illnatur'd old  Let ev'ry tongue its various censure chuse  Absolve with coldness or with spight accuse  Fair truth at last her radiant beams will raise  And malice vanquish'd heighten virtue's praise  Let then thy favour but indulge my flight  O let my presence make thy travels light  HENRY  But canst thou wield the sword and bend the bow  With active force repel the sturdy foe  When the loud tumult speaks the battle nigh  And winged deaths in whistling arrows fly  Wilt thou tho' wounded yet undaunted stay  Perform thy part and share the dang'rous day  EMMA  Near thee mistrust not constant I'll abide  And share each danger fearless by thy side  Tho' my inferior strength may not allow  That I should bear or draw the warrior bow  With ready hand I will the shaft supply  And joy to see thy victor arrows fly  Touch'd in the battle by the hostile reed  Should'st thou but heav'n avert it should'st thou bleed  To stop the wounds my finest lawn I'd tear  Wash them with tears and wipe them with my hair  HENRY  But canst thou tender maid canst thou sustain  Afflictive want or hunger's pressing pain  When with hard toil we seek our ev'ning food  Berries and acorns from the neighb'ring wood  And find amongst the cliffs no other house  But the thin covert of some gather'd boughs  Wilt thou not then reluctant send thine eye  Around the dreary waste and weeping try  Tho' then alas that trial be too late  To find thy father's hospitable gate  That gate whence long excluded thou must mourn  That gate for ever barr'd to thy return  EMMA  Did I but purpose to embark with thee  On the smooth surface of a summer's sea  While gentle  Zephyrs  play in prosp'rous gales  And fortune's favour fills the swelling sails  But would forsake the ship and make the shoar  When the winds whistle and the tempests roar  No  Henry  no One sacred oath has ty'd  Our loves one destiny our life shall guide  HENRY  But e're thou goest unhappy'st of thy kind  Thy sex and habit thou must leave behind  No longer shall thy comely tresses break  In flowing ringlets on thy snowy neck  But with a bolder stride and looser air  Mingl'd with men a man thou must appear  Vagrants and outlaws shall offend thy view  For such must be my friends a hideous crew  With such must  Emma  hunt the tedious day  Assist their violence divide their prey  With such she must return at setting light  Tho' not partaker witness of their night  Now  Emma  now the last reflection make  What thou would'st follow what thou must forsake  EMMA  O Grief of heart that our unhappy fates  Force thee to suffer what thy honour hates  Mix thee amongst the bad or make thee run  Too near the paths which virtue bids thee shun  Yet with her  Henry  still let  Emma  go  With him abhor the vice but share the woe  And sure my little heart can never err  Amidst the worst if  Henry  still be there  HENRY  O wildest thought of an abandon'd mind  Name habit parents woman left behind  Ev'n honour dubious thou preferr'st to go  Wild to the woods with me said  Emma  so  Or did I dream what  Emma  never said  O guilty error and oh wretched maid  Whose roving fancy would resolve the same  With him who next should tempt her easy fame  EMMA  Are there not poisons racks and flames and swords  That  Emma  thus must die by  Henry  's words  Yet what could swords or poison racks or flame  But mangle and disjoint this brittle frame  More fatal  Henry  's words they murder  Emma  's fame  Did e'er my tongue speak my unguarded heart  The least inclin'd to play the wanton's part  Did e'er my eye one inward thought reveal  Which angels might not hear and virgins tell  And hast thou  Henry  in my conduct known  One fault but that which I must ever own  That I of all mankind have lov'd but thee alone  HENRY  Vainly thou talk'st of loving me alone  Each man is man and all the sex is one  Nor in love's ritual can we ever find  Vows made to last or promises to bind  Be wise and false shun trouble seek delight  Change thou the first nor wait thy lovers flight  Why shouldst thou weep let Nature judge our case  I saw thee young and fair pursu'd the chase  Of youth and beauty I another saw  Fairer and younger yielding to the law  Of our allruling mother I pursu'd  More youth more beauty blest vicissitude  This younger fairer pleads her rightful charms  With present power compels me to her arms  And years may roll e'er in her turn the maid  Shall weep the ardor of my love decay'd  EMMA  Are we in life thro' one great error led  Is each man perjur'd and each nymph betray'd  Of the superior sex art thou the worst  Am I of mine the most compleatly curst  Yet let me go with thee and going prove  From what I will endure how much I love  This potent beauty this triumphant fair  This happy object of our diff'rent care  Her let me follow her let me attend  A servant She may scorn the name of friend  Yet when encreasing grief brings slow disease  And ebbing life on terms severe as these  Will have its little lamp no longer fed  When  Henry  's mistress shows him  Emma  dead  Rescue my poor remains from vile neglect  With virgin honours let my herse be deck'd  Oh let my  Henry  then at least persuade  This happy nymph that  Emma  may be laid  Where thou dear author of my death where she  With frequent eye my sepulchre may see  See the sad fate which she may one day prove  Who hopes from  Henry  's vows eternal love  HENRY  Hear solmn  Jove  and conscious  Venus  hear  And thou bright maid believe me whilst I swear  No time no change no future flame shall move  The wellplac'd basis of my lasting love  O powerful virtue O victorious fair  At least excuse a trial too severe  No banish'd man condemn'd in woods to rove  Intreats thy pardon and implores thy love  In me behold the potent  Edgar  's heir  Belov'd in peace and terrible in war  Crown of my love and honour of my youth  Henry  thy  Henry  with eternal truth  As thou may'st wish shall all his life employ  And sound his glory in his  Emma  's joy  Music and song shall wake the marriageday  And while the priests accuse the brides delay  Myrtles and roses shall obstruct her way  Hence then for ever from my  Emma's  breast  That heav'n of softness and that seat of rest  Ye doubts and fears and all that know to move  Tormenting grief and all that trouble love  EMMA  O Day the fairest sure that ever rose  Period and end of anxious  Emma  's woes  Sire of her joy and source of her delight  Now wing'd with pleasure take thy happy flight  Yet tell thy vot'ry potent queen of love  Henry  my  Henry  will he never rove  Will he be ever kind and just and good  And is there yet no mistress in the wood  None none there is the thought was rash and vain  A false idea and a fancy'd pain  Doubt shall for ever quit my strengthen'd heart  And anxious jealousie's corroding smart  Nor other inmate shall inhabit there  But foft belief young joy and pleasing care  But hark  HENRY  What sounds harmonious strike the ravish 'dear    SCENE shifting  VENUS  is discovered alighting from her Car    RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  VENUS  HENRY  and  EMMA  kneeling    Descending from my sacred Paphian bow'r  Far hence I've chac'd suspicion and her train  Hail happy pair extatic bliss pursue  And reap the harvest of your well try'd love  These two stanzas are omitted to shorten the representation  AIR  Miss  BROWN  To  HENRY  Now thy trophies grac'd with beauty  HENRY'S valor is repaid  Love and honor be thy duty  Guardian of the  Nut brown Maid  To  EMMA  Tho' our slaves when most obeying  Are but captives of the mind  EMMA beauty's sceptre swaying  Will a constant empire find  AIR  VENUS  To  BOTH  Love's bondage shall charm ye  No tumults alarm ye  If anxious you fan the dear fire  The flame once neglected  Its rays back reflected  By Time's icy fingers expire  CHORUS  Hark the spheres with rapture swelling  Ratify their vows above  Fame with ready trumpet telling  HENRY'S honorEMMA'S love  THE END
