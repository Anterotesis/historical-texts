 THE HISTORY OF TOM FOOL  More know TOM FOOL than TOM FOOL knows  VOL II  LONDON Printed for T WALLER opposite FetterLane FleetStreet  M DCC LX  THE HISTORY OF TOM FOOL  CHAP I  T  HE Report of young  Fool  's Marriage spread like a new Fashion Curio∣sity brought several of the neighbouring Gentry to stare at the Wretch Lady  Greensy  had thrown herself away upon  Sir  Martin Fullmatt  very wisely ob∣serv'd as he and his Family were travel∣ling to pay the Wedding Visit that  there was something very dark in this Match But Matrimony tho' it may make the Husband dimsighted always opens the Wife's Eyes Therefore Lady  Ferd  declared she cou'd see the Scheme as plain as Noonday but must beg to be excused from saying any more yet it was Time enoughlet the longest Liver take Broom Field  Sir  Martin  Right my Dear leave it to Time that's my Way and I may say without Vanity in all the Affairs of Conse∣quence that have been on the Carpet for Years I never once have been mistakenI have always left them to Time  Lady  I wish Sir  Martin  you wou'd not put one in Mind of Time soyou know it vapours me and therefore chuse to do itLord if  Greensy  's Husband shou'd dare  Sir  Martin  How Madam am I  Lady  Patience dear Sir  Martin  I'm not going to make any Comparisons As to the Fright she has married he must be some odd Mortal a strange Animal to be sure But her Ladyship alter'd her  Opinion before she had been half an Hour in Mr  Fool  's Company The Moment he went out of the Room she address'd his Lady withby my Soul  Bella  I doat upon your Choice Let me dye my dear Creature if I don't honour your Taste the young Gentleman is immensely agreeable and it must be vastly odd indeed if you ar'nt vastly happy  Lady  Fool  Indeed Lady  Ferd  I have no Reason to complainas to the Censures of the Word  Lady  Ferd  Well now that's vastly high indeed What have People of Fashion to do with the World the vulgar Part of it I mean Women of Quality are not to be called to Account for what they do so they have nothing to answer for  Young  Fullmatt  Sir  Martin  's eldest swore he wou'dn't give a Fox's Brush for all that the World said of him one way or t'other but yet if he sat in the House as his Father did he'd muzzle the Mob's Mouths tho' they shou'dn't babble about what their Betters did He wish'd he was Whipperin to'um that's all  Sir  Martin  Child the Observations made by In∣feriors are extrajudicial and politi∣cally  Lady  Ferd  Dear Sir  Martin  for Heaven's Sake no Politics nor no Parties  Miss  Dear Meem that's true I kent bear any Party but one at Kedrill and I beg we may have a Pool won't that agreeable Creater your Spouse my Lady make one with us  Lady  Fool  Mr  Fool  Ladies never plays at Cards  Lady  Ferd  My GodHow do you do to kill Time then when you don't see Com∣pany I am sure Sir  Martin  and I shou'd be the two dullest Creatures ex∣isting if it wa'ant for Cardsfor he's so apt to doze after Dinner and I de∣test Reading  Young  Fullmatt  I hope my Lady with your Leave to have the Honour of introducing Mr  Fool  to our Sporting Club  Lady  Fool  I am oblig'd to you Sir but I have heard him say he is not fond of Horse∣racing  Indeed I believe his chiefest Diversion is Books  Young  Fullmatt  Books Books a Diversion I'm sure I didn't think them so while I was at um They are well enough indeed for Parsons or those that deal in um but for a Man of Fashion to readbar that throw however let his Chaplain What has he got else to doBut for Gentlemen to throw away their Time upon such NonsenseI'd as soon go of my own MessagesNow here's a Dog my Lady better than e'er a Library in  Europe  Miss  Lord now shall we be stunn'd with a Fox Chace I suppose  Young  Fullmatt  That's as good as a Fool's Chace I supposeMy Sister's never easy with∣out she has half a score Couple of Beaux yelping about herLady  Fool  to pre∣vent any farther Altercation had the Cardtables brought in immediately Upon which all the good Company came to Order  CHAP II  PAST Four o'Clock and a Moon∣light Morning the Company broke up and with the Reader's Leave as indeed it is but Goodmanners we'll see Sir  Fullmatt  's Family safe Home  Sir  Martin  as he hobbled into the Hall began by certain shooting Symp∣toms to expect a severe Attack in both Feet therefore order'd his Bed to be warm'd immediately Upon which his Lady cou'd not help observing she thought it was vastly odd that ever since Sir  Martin  's Gout had made them lye in separate Apartments he was always hur∣rying to Bed But I insist Sir  Martin  before you do go you shall let me know your Opinion of  Greensy  's Choice For my Part tho' I detest Scandal I wonder what some Women are made of to bra∣zen it out as she does Well for Effron∣tery she indeed does exceed any thing I ever sawAs to her Husband as she calls himmy GodI'm sick of Wed∣lockThe Fellow is really personal enoughbut her telling us he was a  GentlemanI shall never love Gentility again  Sir  Martin  It is to me a Matter of much Won∣der  Lady  Ferd  Nay my Dear why shou'd you wonder at what some of our Sex will doWhy now you saw fine Miss  Relt  TodayShe's with Child by the Butler  Miss  Now that to me is amazing if a Lady did fall her Pride shou'd not methinks her own Spirit wou'd hinder her from sinking If I did intrigue it shou'd be with somebody of Family howeverThat's what I blame my Bro∣ther for to take up with such a coarse Creature as our Housemaid  Bett  is I wonder how he can touch her filthy Flesh  Young  Fullmatt  was nettled to be re∣proach'd for his Indelicacy of Taste and replied to his Sister rather too tartly She return'd it the Parents join'd in the Dispute and the Quarrel might have been attended with bad Consequences had not the Delinquent Mrs  Betty  been call'd for and as soon as she enter'd my Lady order'd her out of Doors vow∣ing  she wou'd not sleep under the same Roof with a Strumpet  The rest of the Family then prepared for Bed all but young  Fullmatt  he was resolv'd to keep  Betty  Company in the Hall Porch till Daylight  After he had every way endeavour'd to pacify the Maid swearing the Loss of her Place shou'd be no Loss to her The Girl interrupted him sobbing that's not it Squire thank God I don't fear to get my Living but to be call'd Whore soI dursn't say any thing be∣fore your Father or else it was at my Tongue's End when Madam call'd me Strumpet so and spit in my Face I cou'd have told her ay and Miss too if I am one I a'ant the only one in the Family no that I a'ant for all she's your Sister  Young  Fullmatt  's Curiosity was rais'd he press'd the Girl very seriously to ex∣plain herself and whether it was owing to Revenge or Remorse or Friendship every Operation of Female Dispositions has not yet been mathematically ascer∣tain'd but she led him like  Guy Fox  with a dark Lanthorn in his Hand into that Part of the House which was thought by most of the Family to be  haunted There lay his Mama along with the Gardener And as fast asleep in an adjoining Room the Bed∣cloaths all toss'd off outspread was Miss  Fullmatt  and his Honour's Po∣stillion  For some Moments the Esquire stood astound he rubb'd his Eyes look'd on his Sister stared at the Maid Then treading softly on Tiptoe he took away his Mother's Sister's and their Gallants Apparel but left his own Coat in the Lad's Room Then fastening all the other Outlets he placed a Light at the Top of an Entry leading down into the Hall from their Chambers and stood under the Windows calling out Fire Fire  This alarm'd the Lovers they started out of Bed scrambled for their Cloaths seized the first Things that came to Handand Helterskelter Slipshod they came tumbling into the Hall together  Young  Fullmatt  stood there in the Dark like a decoy Bird But when by their Voices he found himself sure of his Prey he call'd  Bett  to bring Can∣dles  The first Figure the Light disco∣ver'd was Miss  Fullmatt  with a Horse's Hood on the Postillion in her Bro∣ther's laced Frock Lady  Ferd  with the Gardener's Apron about her Shoul∣ders the Gardener wrapp'd in a Silk Petticoat the Esquire in a Livery Jacket and  Betty  in her Ladyship's Negligee  How they star'd at the Maidor how young  Fullmatt  look'd at them is now impossible to describe For just as their Portraits were going to be colour'd while Shame Sorrow and sundry other Passions alternate flush'd in their Faces a Footman whom the Noise of Fire had waked and who to save his Linnen always lay in Buff bolted naked upon themSuch a Sight sent the Women shrieking away the Esquire turn'd the Fellow to Bed again bid  Bett  see the Ladies safe to their own Rooms and went up Stairs to quiet the Baronet who lay roaring and swearing in a Fit of the Gout he shou'd be burn'd in his Bed  Next Morning the Gardener and Lad were discharg'd and the Maid who but the Night before was not suffer'd to sleep in the House took Place of all her  fellow Servants by the Title of my Lady's Woman  When Sir  Martin  heard of this he cou'd not account for itBut as my Lady permitted him to know only as much as she thought proper of dome∣stic Occurrences he satisfied himself with remarkingthat there are sudden Changes in private Families as well as Kingdoms beyond the Ken of keenest Politicians  CHAP III  AMONG the many welldress'd Visitants Mr  Fool  on the Ac∣count of his Marriage had the Honour of being Gentleman Usher to one La∣dy as he offer'd her his Hand with a Sigh tenderly looking at him in a plaintive Tone whispered What Mr  Fool  have you forgot me  Tom  blush'd bowed his Heart beat quick with downcast Look he reply'd No Ma∣dam nor ever shall I and trembling he led her into the Parlour  The Reader may suppose this Lady to be Miss  Fash  it was indeedthe late Miss  Fash  She had given her Hand to the Right Honourable Lord  Pillow  For Lady Dowagerbut to preserve the Unity of our Drama we must beg Leave to return To the  History of Patchwork  In the Conclusion of the Chapter of Ghosts Mr  Israel  wrapp'd up in the Roquelaure barefooted limp'd to his Lodgings Miss  Mask  took Post Chaise that Evening for  London  Esquire  Sin∣gleten  went to the Christopher's to drink  away his Misfortunes and  Junior  and  Matilda  saunter'd to her Sister's  Batilda  and her  Dutch  Merchant in three or four Days set out for  London  and Miss  Demirep  with them unlover'd Such an universal Dissipation then reign'd at  Bath  that a Lady of her Figure Ele∣gance Wit and strong Sensations was neglected for the more fascinating Ex∣cercise of the E O Table  Junior  and  Matilda  who grew re∣markably intimate staid at  Bath  and Esquire  Singleten  with them This lastmentioned Gentleman made strong Pro∣fessions of Friendship to  Junior  and be∣hind his Back was as eager in his Pro∣testations of Love to  Matilda  nay the Esquire proffer'd to make her a very handsome Settlement This she told  Junior  who advised her by all Means to accept of the Conditions for as he ob∣served Constancy was no Moneygetting Virtue Pleasure she might keep always in waitingbut l a Year was not an every Day Visitor As he spoke like a Man of Sense and one who knew the World and the best Way to live in it she was ruled by him Therefore with her Consent he borrowed for his own Use Pieces of the Esquire then like  a Man of Honour put the Lady into the Lender's Hands as a Security  With that Sum  Junior  intending to strike a bold Stroke set up an Equipage and as it was Taste then to be waited on by foreign Servants he hired a  Swiss  or  Frenchman  its all the fame in the  Greek  for his Valet  Junior  called him a  Swiss  indeed as  England  was then at War with  France  he would not be thought so AntiAntigallican as to che∣rish an Enemy differently thought his Servant he knew himself to be a Sub∣ject and Slave of the Grand Monarch that it was his Duty to make Reprisals upon his King's Enemies taking the Advantage of his Master's coming Home late one Evening and very much in Li∣quor he plunder'd him of all his Cash Watch Ring  c  and with the Dex∣terity common to that Nation eluded his Pursuers This Misfortune threw  Junior  into Prison where he met with  Tom Fool  as related in the first Part as Reference being had thereto will more fully appear  CHAP IV  BY the Help of his faithful  Amy  he gain'd his Liberty but ingrateful∣ly contracted an Acquaintance with a  Dutch  Jewess who formerly had been a celebrated Woman of the Town but of late Years hawk'd Trinkets about at Coffeehouses With this  Hebrew  La∣dy he sat forwards for  Turnbridge  but as at the first Baitingplace he met with a Person it much behoved him to ac∣knowledge we beg Leave to journalize the Particulars  One of the Guests being rather too pro∣lix in saying Grace after Dinner was question'd by another of the Company If he didn't think the Meat would digest as well without so much Ceremo∣ny Hoot Hoot ye tawk Blosphomy mon  replied the Preacher  and snatch∣ing down his Hat stroaked his Hair up behind his Ears and muttering some Words to himself hurried out of the Room  A Gentlewoman in a Vellumholed Habit formerly new observed after taking a large Pinch of Snuff that there ought to be a Distinction made between the Sinful and the Needful But as this  is the Lady we have given the Reader the Trouble to halt for whoever thou art O patient Peruser of this Perfor∣mancebehold her Picture as she sat to  Junior  and which we beg all Facepainters to take Notice of both Pen and Pencil Men  Her Countenance had not lost all its original Brightness for her Forehead and Nose were abundantly enrich'd with purplecolour'd Pimples The Lillies of her Neck were sallow'd by the im∣moderate Use of Snufftaking and the Roses of her Cheeks crack'd crimson'd and peel'd by the fiery Exhalations of Juniper Her Teeth like the remain∣ing Pillars at  Persepolis  stood irregular∣ly and seem'd decaying The Ala∣baster Hue was sably sullied as if in Mourning for their departed Neighbours She wore by way of Tete a bob Wig once Brown but by long Use was tann'd into a dingy Red From under∣neath which some straggling grey Hairs hung down her Temples like Icicles in dirty Thatch  After recovering her Hand from her Snuffbox she very emphatically insist∣ed that whatever is is right because it was to be for Predestination as she ob∣served was one of the Cardinal Virtues  Landlady  Indeed Madam and so I have often told my Husband it was to be for Women are sometimes drove to do such Things they can no more account for than why our Beer is fine sometimes and sometimes muddy  Doctor's Spouse  In our Sex Madam there is an Agi∣tation of the Senses which compels us to commit some Things for which in∣deed we were preordain'd  Innkeeper  But Madam suppose I find a Man in Bed with my Wife is that ordain'd too I've heard Marriages were made in Heaven but I don't believe Whore and Rogue were  Doctor's Spouse  The Crime Sir should never be laid at the Lady's Door for as  Mat Prior  says  If Women chance to go astray  Their Stars are more in Fault than they  The Landlady clapp'd her Hands to∣gether and cry'd outso they are to be sure MadamAn't please the Lord I'll drink the Gentleman's Health that said so Pray Ma'am wa'ant he a Bishopa Bishopno he was too good for one of that SortTheir spiri∣tuous Court will punish a poor Girl when a Rogue gets her with Child tho' as you say Madam she was ordained to it  Mr  Pattern  the Rider thrusting the Points of the Fork he had employed as a Picktooth into the Table observed that there was so much about Bishops and Religion nowadays the Nation's sick on't  Doctor  But if they wou'd take my Antiper∣pendicular Catoptric Syphilicon Elixir it would bring Great  Britain  right again  Pattern  The Nation was never so near being undone as now nor becoming a Pro∣vince to  France  neither  English  Liber∣ty Yes faith fine  English  Liberty in∣deed here they have put down Mas∣querades without having an Act of Par∣liament for it and here's a new Tax upon Cards and they talk of Dogs pay∣ing Duty to I have a Couple of Poin∣ters and a Leash of Greyhounds that  always in the Season go my Rounds with me now let me see any Body make me pay Excise for 'um that's all any single ManDammee if it was  Jack Broughton  if I woudn'tA sud∣den Outcry prevented him from finishing his Harangue he sat with Mouth open and Eyes fix'd and aghast the crow∣ing of a Cock will terrify a Lion  Junior  run up the Stairs to the Place from whence the Noise issued and the Women followed him  The Doctor Rider and Landlord kept their Seatsthe Innkeeper in∣deed once said he wou'd go up to take care of his Wifebut the other two observing he was hang'd who left his Liquor behind him the Motion was overruled  Junior  on bursting open the Cham∣berDoor discover'd the Cookmaid bareheaded her dishevell'd Locks brist∣ling about her Ears in one Hand she grasp'd a pewter Chamberpot and in the other waved a Piece of Linnen which seem'd to be Part of a Shirt Sleeve under the Bed lay the Longwindedgracesayer like a large Turtle his Hands and Head only to be seen  The Landlady sharply enquired into this Confusion the Girl with much  blubbering declared it was all upon Account of that  Scotch  Dog For that as how upon her Honour he wou'd have ravished her Had not  Junior  took the Delinquent's Part they wou'd have pulled the poor Pedlar to Piecesbut they were at last prevail'd on to retire which they did along with the Cookwench to hear every minute Circum∣stance of the intended Rape  After Mr  Macdugle  was enough re∣covered to return Mr  Junior  Thanks thus he delivered himself As I have a Sol tull be saved Ise tall ye the hale Truth gued Sir Sawton got Possession o'me this Afternoon for ye ken unco∣well Sir how he gangs aboot like a roaring Lion And I stud in his Wa Don na ye remamber how that wacked Loon like Tyke tawked Blosphomy aboot Prayer and Grace Oh tis aw oer wi us when Grace gangs oot on us Weel weel Sir I gang'd my Gate and and speerd my Prayerbuke Than as Beelzabub wood ha it this Katchen Whore stepped intull my Room to clap her Cap on her HedeSawton as I tald ye before was a're strong in me and mad me hold a parle wi herwo worth the Time tho' Yet ken me right twas no Art nor Part of mine ane 'twas  aw the Deel's doing himsel he gang'd intull me as he yance did intull the weeporkers when the Swene were sank in the Sea as the Gospull talls us Than Sir I gi her a braw Silk Hankercher sike like this to ha my Wull on her and the Watch wud na lat me lig her down she gat my Gueds and wud na gi me a Bawbee for um and as I tuke a hantle o'her Hair in my Fist she seiz'd my Sark wi yae Hond and wi tither clitter clatter'd o're my Hede wi the mamber Mugg as if she war the Deel's Drummer  On that Instant the tarnish'd Jacket Lady enter'd and reproach'd the  North Britain  with Indelicacy for attempting to force the Wench For Sir turning to  Junior  Women are not to be ravish'd we are free Agents and Compulsion is incompatible with our Passions We may be won for as the Duke of  Marl∣borough  who was a Relation of mine used to say if a Town is open at Top it may be takenSo may our Sex we are openwe are to be taken But Sir I should be pleas'd if you'd retire with me from this Scene of Confusion for as I hear your Name is  Junior  there is something in that Name which alarms my Soul They withdrew and after  interchanging a few Questions she dis∣cover'd herself to be the identical Lady  Senior  secreted among the Gipsies  If  Junior  was pleased at finding his Parent the Lady was no less rejoiced at meeting her Son The whole House was rejoiced and the Evening conclu∣ded with that exquisite Essential to  En∣glish  Happiness a General Drinking Rout  CHAP V  NEXT Day after  Junior  had in∣form'd his Mother of the materi∣al Incidents he had been engaged in she in return began her Story as follows  To have you torn from my Arms to be brought up as a Gipsy shock'd me so essentially I resolv'd to quit the hor∣rid Crew I found an Assylum at an elderly Gentleman's a Batchelor his Name was  Sear  he had made a great Figure formerly in the Beau Monde and had enjoyed as he often told me himself all the fine Women of his Age for he was a vast Wit and it was not then as it is now impossible for a Man to be a Wit and a fine Gentleman to∣gether He had been a perfect Hero in his Time he kept the very best Com∣pany spent two great Estates and was the Terror of all the  London  Watchmen His Courage and Generosity were im∣mense and such a Spiritmy God why he'd make nothing of betting l at a Horserace but such is the Fate of all sublunary Beings he who used to keep three or four Coaches and Six had now only a Footwalk to keep him for when I began my Connection with him  he was only an Exciseman but like  Desdemona  I lov'd him for the Dan∣gers he had passed  I was indeed younger than I am now but I had not acquired that Ease of Fi∣gure I at present enjoy Yet it seems the Infancy of my Bloom made an Im∣pression on his Heart In this Cohabi∣tation I existed about half a Year and by way of Amusement I instructed an elderly Lady's Footboy in whom I dis∣cover'd a vast Genius to write and read  Mr  Sear  my Spouse having Notice that his Friend and Patron the Collec∣tor wou'd be down in a Day or two inform'd me of it I was therefore more than ordinary assiduous about my Ap∣pearance when I knew so great a Man as the Collector was to wait upon us for modern Examples as well as antient History had inform'd me a handsome Wife was a Husband's SheetAnchor therefore for my Spouse's Sake I prac∣tis'd all my Attractions But I had been given up beforehandfor the Lad whom I observ'd to you I took under Instructions disclosed a horrid Plot to me it seems my present Incumbent had agreed to part with me provided the Collector liked me this Proviso shock'd me I was determin'd to disappoint  themWas I not born free And shou'd I be traffick'd for Nay left to a Wretch's Option NoHad this Gen∣tleman or any other Gentleman in a polite Way made himself Master of my Honour either by surprizing me from a Morning's Dream or stealing on me in an Evening's Solitude it was to be forgiven But to be offer'd like dead Game as a Gift nay to have the Chance of a NegativeNo  Pinch  th perish me if my Soul disdain'd not the MotionI left himthe Lad and I took Places in the Waggon for  London  On my Arrival there I applied for Em∣ployment among the Booksellers and really pick'd up a very pretty Living by writing Things against the Govern∣ment Not Child that I was disaffected far from itbut we must eat and any Thing on t'other Side didn't sell so well  The young Man whom I brought to  London  my  Adonis  as I used to call him soon died of a gallopping Consumpti∣on the foul Fogs of  London  were too heavy for the Delicacy of his Frame I was inconsolable nay shou'd certainly have followed him had not my Land∣lady introduced a  Jew  Gentleman to my Acquaintance He took Lodgings for  me at  Hachney  and tho' I was under infinite Obligation to him yet perish me  Pinch  th if I cou'd ever aggregate my Ideas to any Complacency for him I was conscious he was an Infidel nor  Junior  cou'd I ever have believ'd that any Existence sprung from my Womb wou'd so grossly have debased the Dig∣nity of his Specie as you have done by your Cohesion with this  Jew  Woman For me I wou'd sooner go to Bed to a Christian supperless than be kept by the richest Wretch in  England  that did not believe in the New TestamentI soon retreated from such an irreligious Acquaintance  A Gentleman belonging to the Law had Lodgings in the same House we were in He was a great Freethinker and talk'd to me concerning the Eterni∣ty of Matter of the Soul's Materiality and Divisibility and why Reason and Religion were incompatible I was fas∣cinated with his Discourse for his Tongue dropp'd Manna With him I came to  London  for he was a Counsellor and solicitor in Sessions Time at  Justice Hall  and while he follow'd the Court I be∣gan to compile a Treatise on the Ab∣surdity of Faith without Demonstration But my Ideas not being sufficiently ar∣ranged  the Counsellor my Spouse brought me all the best Authors such as  Massey  's Travels  Woolston  against Miracles Christianity as old as the Cre∣ation the Infallibility of human Judg∣ment the Oracles of Reason and se∣veral more of the famous Champions of the rational Side of the Question By their Help I tickled up as pretty a Piece of Metaphysics as ever laid Ax to the Root of Priestcraft But before it was published some Enemies of my Husband's pretending he had forg'd a Seaman's Will and Powers had him ta∣ken up and we wanting Money at that Time to do Things as we shou'd do in respect of Evidence contrary to the Laws of what shou'd be right and wrong he suffer'd  But I'll leave you to guess my dear Son how much I was amazed when I came to comfort him the Evening af∣ter he was cast to see the New Testa∣ment in his HandHeeven he who had made so great a Jest of reveal'd Religion in his ProsperityI was fright∣ed to hear him call out for Mercy wringing his Hands and crying What wou'd become of him in the next World When he used by mathematical Investi∣gations  formerly to prove to me the Impossibility of there being one  After his Decease the Ordinary took me as his Housekeeper I then sup∣press'd my Treatise of Materialism and put forth a Dissertation on the Condition of stillborn Infants in a future State and dedicated it to the Hutchinsonians A Romish Gentleman who used some∣times to visit the Prisoners under Sen∣tence came often to our House we had several logical Disputes he fell in Love with me and promised me to turn Pro∣testant if I wou'd go with himTo save a Soul I did so We went to  York  together where Money being scarce he was oblig'd to leave  England  for trying to make more He left me big of my third Child When I was up having had so much Experience I practised Midwifery for my Genius was always extensive but still I sigh'd for  London  Conscious such a Person as I had and such Abilities shou'd not be bury'd in the Country therefore Ireturn'd to Town and resumed my Pen But the System of writing was alter'dThe Town from Politicians were turn'd Electrifiers I soon made myself Mistress of every atmospherical Experiment In conse∣quence of which I set about a System  wherein I form'd a Process of extracting from the aetherial Fluid an efficient Quantity of pure inflamable Rays of Heat which when collected into con∣cave Speculums of different Diameters placed at right Angles wou'd form a Focus strong enough to destroy any Enemy's Fleet in Harbourand I pre∣sented this Project to the Sunfire Office for their Inspection  I was prevented from putting my De∣sign in Execution by the Owners of Salt∣petre and Gunpowder makers they setting forth in their Case that as they had with great Cost and Pains and solely for the Good of their Country pre∣pared Combustibles enough to destroy the whole World or any Part thereof at a Week's Warning Therefore they remonstrated that if Lightning was once brought into common Use all their vast Stocks of readymade Destruction wou'd lye dead upon their Hands to the great Loss of themselves and Families  Then I began a Compendium of Na∣tural Philosophy wherein I prov'd be∣yond Contradiction that there never were such Things as Mermaids I shew'd demonstratively that  Vesuvius  and Mount  Hecla  could have no Communication I proved that the  Indian  Way of rub∣bing  two Sticks together to make Fire was an Antediluvian Invention Then I wrote a History of the Fly call'd a Blue Bottle and a Dissertation proving the Antiquity of our Marrowbones and Cleaver Music that they came from the Pyrrhic Dances of the  Greeks  striking their Spears and Shields together And in a Supplement I confuted Mr  Swam∣merdam  shewing that the Grubs in  Lapland  are no ways related to the Gnats in  Lincolnshire Fens  This Work which would have made six Vol in Fo∣lio I intended to have publish'd with several Copperplates but the Graving coming dear I laid it by and resolv'd against any more being concern'd in Writings of Consequence so just to kill Time I abridged the Works of the Learned  My Printer's youngest Prentice who used to bring me the Proof of Sheets had acted in several private Plays and wou'd often repeat Speeches to me Now you must know Child I have a strong theatrical Genius but not so much for Acting as for writing PlaysNot but I believe if the Managers and I could have agreed I should have exhibited in about half a Score of  Cibber  's or  Wof∣fington  's or  Pritchard  's PartsBut  there happened at this Time to be a Dearth of dramatic Writers therefore I undertook to manure and fertilize the Theatres  Don't imagine me vain Child I was qualified for this Undertaking I had read over  Aristotle  and all the  French  Critiques and wou'd have suffer'd Mar∣tyrdom sooner than wrote any Thing in Violation of the Unities I am consci∣ous  Shakespear  's Writings are crept into some Estimation Yet you see no dra∣matic Writer now chuses to copy him his Flights are bold but very irregular to be sure Indeed considering the Time he lived in and his being unac∣quainted with the Classics some of his Pieces are pretty enoughbut rude tho'his Clowns for Instancethey are absolutely incongruous to the Politesse of the  French  Drama for it must be granted that every Thing which is quite comic must be quite low there∣fore not fit for the Delicacy of the Boxes so I turn'd the Merry Wives of  Wind∣sor  into a Tragedygot a great Man's Letter and it was put into Rehearsal  The first Thing I had then to do was to insert proper Paragraphs in the Pa∣pers for Advertisements are as necessary to prepare the Town as Physic is before  Inoculation Puffing for a Thing is as essential as the Thing itselfI have in my Time puffed three or four Players into very good SalariesI scorn to ca∣lumniateBut what did I ever get in ReturnNot this Pinch of  Strasbourg  perish meNo matterGratitude is not a concomitant Characteristic in thea∣tric Breasts  Her Majesty's Death shutting up the Houses my Tragedy was postpon'd but hold I am premature in my Story I was mentioning about our Printer's Prentice rehearsing several Parts of Plays with me One Day by a Fatality the greatest Metaphysician never cou'd ac∣count for as we were performing the Couch Scene of  Loveless  and  Berinthia  I granted him the last Favour Some∣what hung over me impelling me as it were and made such Actions unavoi∣dable His Youth and Eagerness made me forgive him his Obedience and As∣siduity made me doat on him  As soon as he was out of his Time we were lawfully marry'd till unluckily taking Lodgings for the Air in  Moor∣feilds  he became acquainted with some of the Tabernacle Preachers there they thunder'd so much in his Head about Sin and such Stuff I was forced to put  him among the Incurables I then found a Friend in the Gentleman with whom I am at present He's a Physicianit is true indeed he travelsWhat then 'Tis his Humanity only that wakes him keep a Stage People in every Town press him to settle with them but as I and my Husband tell them if he was confin'd to one Spot what must become of the rest of  England  For Country Doctors and Apothecaries are so igno∣rantmy God And yet to see the Force of Genius The Doctor took it all himself he was not bred up to it His Father is only a Ticket PorterWhat then The Parent of  Socrates  made Barbers Blocks  CHAP VI  THE next Day  Junior  and his La∣dy prepared to set forward But as Mrs  Slymstraat  was putting up her Things she discovered the Doctor's Wife and the Merry Andrew in a too familiar Conversation  When  Junior  heard of this he took his Mother aside to expostulate with her But she interrupted him saying Child there is an essential Distinction be∣tween voluntary Sin and the Necessity of acting As for what happened between me and  Robin  it was no more than an Accident of Matter I was lost in Re∣flection It was not criminal in me I was merely passive therefore not cul∣pable because not intentionally guilty But as for that Infidel to reproach me with want of Taste meno  Junior  I love you as much as a Mother ought but never see my Face again unless you part from that Unbeliever Then in∣stantly bridling herself up she stalk'd out of the Room with the Straddle Toss and Importance of an  Haymarket Signiora  after finishing a  Da Capo  Junior  appeared at  Tunbridge  to be quite the Thing He dress'd gay drank deeply play'd high swore ele∣gantly and sung drolly He was Ma∣ster of Arts in Sentimentmaking had all Odds  ad Unguem  As for the Pedi∣gree of a Plate Horse he was a critical Genealogist  He took Care to make much Parade of his Honour therefore was thought to be one of very strict PrincipleFor it was his Maxim that according to the first Impression which you make upon the Company thro' that Medium you will be afterwards look'd at  Among the many Personages who ex∣hibited themselves at the Wells that Sea∣son there was a Person who by his Address seem'd to be a Gentleman He was allow'd to be a very sensible Man by an Observation or two which he made at a Picture Sale the Day he came downHe was allow'd to be very rich tooYet so great an Oddity he never went to the Gaming Table rarely to the Tavern and then not a Word of Politics slipt from himHe seem'd very fond of reading which made the very polite Company there fancy he had crack'd his Brain by Study  The inquisitive Club had been very busy in enquiring after himA Club where Scandalbut why shou'd Spleen fall from a Poet's PenNo it is proper some People shou'd meddle with other Peoples Business It is the Duty we owe our Country a Duty we owe our Neigh∣bours a Duty we own ourselves to be assiduous in our Questions not only concerning Persons we don't know but more especially to examine into every Report that is propagated of Intrigue or Malepractices in our Friends and those we do know  Junior  whose Scheme was to make all the Acquaintance he cou'd among money'd Men judg'd this Gentleman well worth knowing and soon made the Stranger's Temper his StudyFor like  Alcibiades Jack  cou'd be any thing with any Man  But what is  Tom Fool  doing all this while Why must the History of a Sharpera dull Copy of Count  Fathom  be retail'd upon the Reader Is it judg∣ment to suffer the principal Character in this Epic to be idle so long and let an Episode in Bulk exceed the grand His∣tory When  Tom Fool  was in Goal no∣thing cou'd be expected from him But now he is married every thing is ex∣pectedby  various People thus has the Editor been questioned All his reply wasPatienceMr  Fool  like other newmarried Gentlemen is waiting in his white Gloves Master of the Cere∣monies at the Ladies LeveeWe'll therefore let him alone until the visiting Week is over and attend upon Mr  Saltern  that is the strange Gentleman's Name and  Junior  who were thus con∣versing together  Junior  I have met with many Disappoint∣ments Sir  Saltern  Disappointments are as incidental as Colds and most Persons are equally ready to prescribe for bothBe Judge Sir how I have been disappointed  When I was a Youth by the flattery of my Tutors and Dependants I was made to believe my own Understanding superior to the rest of Mankind there∣fore was resolv'd to spare no Costs or Pains till I had acquired that high and mighty selfsufficient Title A Man of universal Knowledge  After I had pleas'd myself with reflect∣ing on my Plan as Maidens do of Ma∣trimony I began to put it in Execution Having the Good of my Country at  Heart I intended to get a Seat in Parlia∣ment therefore immediately apply'd myself to the Study of Eloquence But  Tully  in his Treatise upon Rhetoric doubting whether Oratory was more an Advantage or Detriment to the State I became irresolutenay soon relin∣quish'd it despairing to excel in what  Cicero  was found Fault with both by  Brutus  and  Quintilian  Yet bent to pursue the Good of my Country I attended Borough Jobbing but a Change in the Ministry forcing me to have all my Work to do over again I grew tired of so precarious an Employment went once more to my Books and immersed myself in ancient PhilosophyWhat a Parcel of Absur∣dities did I there meet with Every Fel∣low at that time of Day with an over∣heated Imagination or possess'd of inve∣terate Rancour set up for a Systemmaker There required not much Ca∣pital to begin with they open'd their Opinions and the World at once be∣came their Customers For altho' there is not any thing to be conceiv'd more ridiculous than what the Sectarists of all Ages have in their Turns asserted yet such is the Weakness Wilfulness and Vanity of human Kind they are  sure to find Followers Believers and Defenders  Like a Town Lady on her first Coun∣try Visit I soon grew tired of my Com∣pany shifted my Quarters into the planetary System and found the Study of Astronomy very much to my Satis∣faction I lectured upon the Orrery explain'd Attraction settled the Comets Routs accounted for the Winds and Tides pervaded thro' the milky Way assign'd Causes  à Priori  and boldly and technically answer'd for all the Motions of the Universe  I grew very fond of the Discoveries I made nightly in the Moon For having  Stevelius  's Map of that Planet by that and from what he had wrote upon it cou'd by the help of my Glasses see very plainly upon her Surface Rivers Rocks Towns Trees and Churches But af∣terwards reading  Hugenius  he contra∣dicted all the Moonland Discoveries nay proves it is not possible for us to discover any Objects on her Disk I confess after weighing his Arguments all my former pretty Prospects vanish'dI cou'd not find one Picture on the Moon's Face I had formerly fancy'd thereAway went my Telescopes  Then I became eager to study His∣tory But by their own Accounts anci∣ent Authors are not much to be depended upon and Moderns too often misled by the Rage of Party religious Prejudices or Partialities to their own Country Determined no more to depend on what others had said but resolv'd to search into the Nature of Things myself I erected a Laboratory I was at first fond of  Galen  till meeting with the Work of  Paracelsus  left off my first MasterBut I as soon grew sick of the Second when I found even this  Para∣celsus  who ridicules  Galen  so much and who promised himself vast Riches and Longevity from his rare Secrets die insolvent between forty and fifty From him I turn'd to  Van Helmont  but read∣ing his Process upon the four PortersI threw all my chymical Volumes into the Furnace gave the whole Furniture of my Laboratory to the Workhouse and turn'd my Speculations to Physic That I did not attend long disgusted at not being able to account for animal Secretion  In vain I read and it was as much in vain for me to enquire They told me indeed that the Stomach like the Load∣stone was possess'd of occult Qualities  That I granted but was determin'd not to pursue a Study where we cou'd not come to a Demonstration of its first and grand Principle  To dissipate the Chagreen which the Insufficiency of these Pursuits had occa∣sion'd I undertook Music When I heard the Compositions of the great Ma∣sters they transported me I no longer wonder'd at the extravagant Effects Poets ascrib'd to the Power of Sounds I im∣mediately became Consort Hunterstudied Compositions and cou'd relish no Companions but those who under∣stood the Nature of Unisons but was ve∣ry much surpriz'd to find that most musical Performers look'd with Disdain on the Professors of every Art and Science but their own Yet except in their own they are the most incurious and unenter∣taining of any other Artists Nay even in the very Branch they excel you must tire yourself with requesting before they'll exhibit But when once they be∣gin they know not how to stop but are as palling by doing too much as they were disgustful before by not doing any thing I bid adieu to the Gamut least it shou'd lead me into the same Infatuation  My next Attempt was extremely amusingI studied Painting and  Sculpture but was shock'd at the un∣friendly Treatment several Men of Me∣ritgave their Contemporaries  I had like to have tumbled over Head and Ears into the Tide of Taste and be∣come Picturefancier Auctionhunter and Connoisseur But as I had studied with∣out travelling my Opinions were not of equal Weight with those who had tra∣vell'd without studying  The better to judge of Sculpture and some parts of Painting I found it ne∣cessary to apply myself to Anatomy and as that in some Measure is connected with both natural and experimental Phi∣losophy I soon gave myself up entirely to the Investigations of Nature I dragg'd the Ditches for Embryo's com∣mitted Burglary upon the Habitations of halfform'd Insects stripp'd Trees of their Moss examin'd Puffballs and search'd for the Heads of Snake Stones  I have seen Sir the Circulation of Blood in a Frog's Toes Spider's Leg and a Shrimp's Tail I have counted the Number of blue Animals a Sloe has upon its Surface and knew accurately what Penfeathers there were in a But∣terfly's Wing  Many curious Observations have I made upon Duckweed and Dung∣hillwater  and the several  Animalcula  in each  I have impaled Gnats upon Pins to try how long they cou'd live without eating Have press'd Woodlice and Silkworms to Death to discover their seminal  Ani∣malcula  and destroy'd many Colonies of Ants to be certain whether they did or did not bite off the Ends of the Corn I have attended the microscopical Dissec∣tions of Bugs to resolve that grand Debate among the Learned whether they were or were not Hermaphrodites I have also open'd Batts to authenticate what Genius they shou'd be class'd un∣der Birds or Beasts  Junior  Do you think Sir these Studies benefit the Understanding  Saltern  Yes Sirjust as much as making your Fences in the  Chinese  Manner wou'd improve your EstateYet so far is Prejudice prevailing that were we to deride such Pursuits all the minute Phi∣losophers wou'd be alarm'd and our Treatment wou'd be as severe as if at  Madrid  we shou'd reason against SaintworshipingI own I have been asto∣nish'd at beholding Millions of Beings smaller than the smallest Grain of Sand  skimming upon the Water sailing along the Air and circulating in our finest Fluids I ask'd myself seriously what these cou'd be forThat  For  was my Gordian Knot  I determin'd to find out a Man of Sense to whom I cou'd communicate my Doubts and by comparing our O∣pinions we might come to know why and for what End these Things were soI related my Design to the only sur∣viving Relation I have a prodigious Humourist  When he had heard me outhe shook his Head methinks I see him now and reply'dOh Nephew Ne∣phew before you endeavour to account for the Deity's Actions regulate your own Don't begin the Study of Wisdom at the wrong End like some of our Folks of Fashion who are sent Abroad before they see their own CountryReceive Things as they are use them as they shou'd be employ your Talents in praiseworthy Exercises but throw not away your Time in vain Specula∣tions like the thirsty Lunatic who when he arrived at a River instead of quench∣ing his Thirst lost himself in looking for the Springhead  I made him a Bow thanked him for his Advice promis'd him to consider of it but left the Room and my Pro∣mise behind melike a Lover who requests his Friend's Opinion tho' he is already determin'dI set out upon my Travels immediately to search for a Man of Sense  I knew Nature not partial to Birth therefore fancy'd Understanding like Beauty might be found among the meanest and began my Enquiry among the Shepherds and Labourersbut found them as reasonless as the Cattle they tended They possess'd a low Cun∣ning which answer'd all their Ends  Junior  Poets indeed amuse us Sir with fine Stories about pastorial Simplicity Innocence might go to Market in  Ar∣cadia  but in  England  's Country Towns Vice and Folly are as well receiv'd as in any Parish within the Bills of Morta∣lity except that of playing at Cards on a  Sunday  Tho' these Country People jump run ring wrestle and play at Football on the Eve of the same Day  Saltern  Then I visited their Mastersbut I was still at FaultMarketday Meet∣ings rubb'd off a little of their Rusti∣cities  yet they were not thoroughly humaniz'dOne Day every Week they were drunk once in seven Years Mad and every Year at Law From them I took a Turn to the Country Squires but they are only Farmers with fine Cloaths on  All the Distinction I cou'd make be∣tween them was the Man of l  per Ann  cou'd kill Game and they who paid him his Rent were persecuted if they kept a Gun in the House  I then paid my Respects to the Coun∣try Gentlemen Cou'd I have been sa∣tisfied among the last I might have hung up my Shieldbut I wanted something morelike a nice Lady of my Acquaintance who resolv'd never to marry till she cou'd meet a Man without a Fault liv'd single till and then run away with her Brother's hump∣back'd Postillion  In the Winter I came up to  London  and took Lodgings in  Pallmall  And as my Search had hitherto been confin'd to my own Sex I resolv'd now to dedi∣cate some Time to the Ladies since I found myself in the Neighbourhood of so many beautiful Assemblages Scarcely had I form'd a proper Acquaintance among them before it almost determin'd  me to give over my Pursuit after a Man of Sense and fix on one of the many amiable Women I had convers'd with as a Partner for Lifebut I was too irresoluteI saw too many and what was worse saw them too often I was weaned from my Thoughts when I be∣held the most elegant Figures and the finest Understandings sacrificed to the Irregularities of Fashion I began to think my Uncle right and cou'd not help confessing that altho' Women and Wisdom are the worthiest Objects of our Admirations yet too much Speculation is ever attended with In∣felicity  I paid my Attendance to the Men in Power But as the Ladies gave up their Merits to the ModeJealousy jaun∣dic'd the fair Face of the great Men's Perfections  I remov'd into the City and directed my Inquest among the Men of Business Here I met many praiseworthy Acquain∣tance The most of those I convers'd with I found to be sensible knowing and sociableYet few very few valued themselves upon what they were really excellent in or cou'd be quiet while they were happy Some I say who af∣ter accumulating large Estates by in∣credible  Industry or as incredible good Fortune were infected by the Epidemic of Taste and commenc'd Connoisseurs Others far gone in a Fondness for Qua∣lity either to be allied or even ac∣quainted with Nobility wou'd lavish all their former Gettings A third Sort who had from among Dangers Hardships and Hazards gather'd a happy Inde∣pendance stung by the Venom of Par∣ty wou'd squander it all to purchase a Seat in Parliament altho' there they never spoke nor were ever properly spoke to  Resolving not to give over my Search I associated with the Men of Repartee but their Inattention to social Duties shock'd me They are such Enthusiasts in Rallery that like  Ben  the Sailor they must have their Joke thof the Ship was sinking Friends as well as Foes are sure to suffer if they come within the way of their Wit like the drunken Prize∣fighter who cut and slash'd every one round him to show People how finely he cou'd flourish  Still resolute in my Inquiry I deter∣min'd to follow Nature tho' she was earth'd in a Nightcellar I was intro∣duc'd among the Choice Spirits as they call themselvesTheir Spirits were  choice indeedThey live the Life of those Insects who are bred brought to Maturity and die within Hours For all that these singsong story telling mimic Existences pretend to is but to eat drink and divert for the Day Ne∣cessity their ruling Passion a Tavern Teat their  summum bonum  Yet among these sometimes you meet with the Glimmerings of Merit tho' sod∣den'd by the Dregs of Debauch  But it often thus happens that even real Genius shall so far debase itself as to prostitute the Bounties of Nature like supperless Streetwalkers to a Set of People whose only Qualifications are they can pay the Reckoning  After laughing at these and the rest of Mankind I began to look back on my past Adventures by way of Recri∣mination but I was not then so much pleas'd as I expected to be I found I had been a Bubble to my own Selfsufficiency that I had set out to seek an Impossibility expecting to meet with a Man who shou'd exceed me in Understanding and yet as I was to be Judge my own Vanity wou'd always prevent me from giving a true Verdict Upon Reflection I found I had only taken Man in the Gross that they had all a Sufficiency of  Understanding to answer the Purposes they were intended for that I was not half the Man of Sense I imagin'd my∣self to be and that from a superficial Knowledge of the World I had despis'd several Persons who had a greater Right to hold me in Contempt  Tomorrow Mr  Junior  I set out for an Estate I have in  SouthWales  and if you are disengag'd and will waste a Month with me a hearty Welcome shall supply the Place of much Ceremony In  Wales  Sir you'll meet with Persons I dare say worth your Acquaintance For altho' they are not as much pa∣troniz'd as the People of neighbouring Principalities and their Mountains in∣deed produce not  Peruvian  Treasure yet the hardy Inhabitants inherit Virtues that wou'd lend a Lustre to the best Birth∣day Dress at the most brilliant Court in  Christendom  Junior  accepted the Invitation pro∣posing to himself many Opportunities for private Play which he knew how to make beneficial But on the second Af∣ternoon of their Travelling Mr  Saltern  's Horse threw him which oblig'd them to lay by for a Day or two  CHAP VII  JUNIOR after seeing his Friend blooded and put to Bed retired and according to the modern Custom of  solo  Travellers order'd a Room and bid the Drawer send in his Master and a Bottle of Claret  As soon as they made their Appear∣ance  Junior  ordering the Landlord to be seated enquir'd if that Gentlewoman in the Bar was the Innkeeper's Spouse who reply'd in the Affirmative  Junior  She's a very fine Woman Landlord won't she take a Glass with us  Landlord  I hope Sir you'll excuse her at present she's very busy but she shall wait upon you at Supper Sir  Junior  I insist then she shall pledge us where she isWaiter carry a Bottle of Claret with my Compliments to your Mistress  Landlord  I humbly thank your Honour but why shou'd she put your Honour to so much Charge tho' to be sure if she does love any Liquor better than ano∣ther it is Claret If your Honour had  been bred and born with her as the Song says you cou'd not have pleased her better  Junior  How long have you been married Landlord  Landlord  Four Years come  Lammas  Sir  Junior  A Man must be vastly happy with such a Wife  Landlord  Happy Sir I don't believe there's never a Gentleman in a hundred Miles lives happier with his Wife than I do Sir I give her her way in every Thing only just in laying out a little MoneyWe are apt to squabble about that now and thenbut its soon overI get out of the Way for when once she begins scolding there's no stopping herThere will be Words in all Families Sir so I let her tattle and I go and buy her some Nicknack and that sweetens her and she's as pleasant as a cool Tankard  Junior  She looks to be very fit for a Bar∣keeper  Landlord  Ay Sir tho' I say it there wou'dn't be a better Barkeeper in the World if  she wou'd but give her Mind to it and so I tell her sometimes for when our House is full of Company she'll gallop ye twenty Miles after a Hare or a new Fashion then we have a few Words in∣deed or else we live as happily as the Day is long  Junior  She seems to be a very handy Woman  Landlord  I can't say as to that Sir she's very well in every Thing else to be sure but as to stirring about her Business she hates it she'll jigg it after a Fiddle for four and twenty Hours together but tir'd to Death if she puts out her Hand only to fold up a Table Cloth  Junior  She looks to be very goodhumour'd  Landlord  Her Temper's a little uneven now and then that's all she's to blame for The Servants seldom do any Thing to please her nor I neither but there's nobody without their Faults she wou'dn't have one in the World if she didn't sulk it so But she'll sometimes go about the House for a Week together taking the Rust as the Jockies say and then I say  Bett  How can you bear Illwill so long That's sure to bring her to her Tongue  for she hates to be call'd  Bett  So then she begins to rate mebut I hark to cover Faith lock myself into the Cyder∣cellar and there am snugg as an earth'd Fox and so Sir my Service to you  Junior  I fancy she's a very agreeable Com∣panion  Landlord  Yes Sir she can talk indeed and does talk toonly she's apt to talk a lit∣tle too much and then she let's her Tongue run about her own Town's Folks sobut this happens only when she gets a Glass too much and yet I love to see her in Company she never baulks her Glass it's Pity she lets it get the bet∣ter of her so  Junior  I am afraid then that Bottle will be too much for her  Landlord  No Sir begging your Honour's Par∣don she has not such a weak Head as that comes to neither if she wou'd but be goodnatur'd when she's elevated but the Devil on 'tisa sudden Up∣roar in the Street stopp'd the Conversa∣tion  Junior  lifting up the Sash saw a Parish Beadle driving before him a poor ragged Figure with a Child swath'd  to her Back the Fellow rudely thrust∣ing his Fist against the Infant as he push'd the Mother along The Cries of the Child hurry'd  Junior  into the Street and he enquired why the poor Creature was used so  She's a Vagrant reply'd the Officer and she wanted to die in our Bounds and she's a Cheat and fainted away just now on Purpose to leave her Bastard upon us  Perhaps replied  Junior  she fainted thro' Want Indeed I did Sir the poor Sufferer reply'd very feebly and turning her Head towards  Junior  as she spoke he observed something of Ele∣gance in her Face tho' it was pale her Eye brows were regularly arch'd her Eyes black and inexpressibly lan∣guishing He cou'd not also help taking Notice of the Evenness and fine Polish of her Teeth and between the dishe∣vell'd Partings of her Hair he saw a Neck of a most extraordinary Whiteness  Junior  tho' not strictly a Man of Ho∣nour now and then had Touches of those subordinate Virtues Generosity and CompassionHe therefore deter∣min'd to relieve her sent off the Beadle and went with her himself to a mother∣ly Woman's House called  Goody Wen  to whom he was recommended by the Neighbours  The Report of this Piece of Humani∣ty reach'd the Inn before  Junior  's Re∣turn Mr  Saltern  congratulated him upon it and on the Conquest he had made for continued he I am certain by the manner in which my Landlady related it to me she's fond of you Wo∣men are more forward to admire or re∣ward Actions of Generosity than our Sex She is of a very sanguine Complexion and you see what a Wretch she has for a Husband for want of something bet∣ter to do I made her Maid tell me her whole History  She was bred up in that old Hall we were admiring when my Horse threw me The Housekeeper's Daughter but at seventeen having added one to the Posterity of  Adam  without asking Leave legally for it she was discharg'd Our Landlord was Butler he marry'd her and the Squire bought this House for them She's now but twentyfour and if I am not extravagant in my Gues∣ses  Junior  she's your own She has been so full of your Praises it must be soat least I beg you'll try if it be on∣ly to satisfy me how far I am right as to reading of Womankind  When  Junior  came down he found in the fore Parlor his Landlady with several Town's Folks  As he enter'd she rose up smiling and in a pretty lisping manner address'd him withdear Sir well to be sure you'll go to Heaven I wish all Gentle∣men were like youLord Sir to have so much Charity upon such a forlorn Creature  To be sure Sir you are one of the best Gentlemen that ever liv'd and yet to see some Folksthat Gentleman came to know the Truth of it for you was told wa'ant you Doctor that the Beggar woman was the Gentleman's Wife and how he had left her and plunder'd her of all she had and so she lighted on him by Chance and so he gave her some Gold for Hushmoney  Mr  Opifer  reply'd he had heard so but the Story was not properly digested for as the animal Spirits are more heat∣ed in the secretory Vessels of some Peo∣ple than of others they see Things in different or adverse Mediums Now Sir turning to  Junior  I am always neu∣tral in my Judgment until I have ana∣lytically consider'd the Ingredients of every Report For it is an establish'd Postulalum with me and not only with  me but with most of the great Men of Antiquity never to believe any thing till we can be assur'd of its Credibility as  Hypocrates  observes in his fortyninth Aphorism  Another of the Company whose Ink∣horn dangling from his Buttonhole de∣noted his Profession rapping his Knuc∣kles hard against the Table call'd out now God forgive my Sins if I didn't hear that this Gentleman begging his Pardonbut that the Woman did pick his Pockets to be sureYes indeed of his Watch and so he did seize her coming to Town  Mr  Illicit  the Attorney declared he had the Case stated three or four diffe∣rent Ways to him and with Submission he cou'd not tell what to decree in it To be sure Charity was not against the Statutes but then to give away such a Sum a five Guineas merely out of Compassion He must demur to that it was contrary to all Law or Equity But however Sir your HealthI have been in  London  myself and have had all the fine Girls there ha Land∣lord you have heard me say so before and they have all their Ups and Downs and so I rest my Plea upon thatThe Gentleman has seen her before or else  he looks to be a Gentleman of too much Sense to throw away such a Sum as five Guineas to encourage Beggars not∣withstanding so many Laws to the con∣trary  As when all ermin'd and emboss'd glittering with foil Stones and spun Glass in Sultana State the high Salary Ac∣tress is seated in the green Room shou'd some inferior allowanced Lady dare to thwart her High Mightiness with even a Hint about Equality of Merit sudden her Imperialness wou'd arise and darting the ScowlTheatric at the Pattinwear∣ing Rival majestically more out of the Room like  Dido  's Ghost silent and sullen  Thus  Junior  gave the Lawyer the Look contemptuous and desiring the Landlady to bring him a Bowl of Rack up Stairs order'd the Waiter to show him into his own Room  After he had slapp'd to the Door the Company sat staring at one another like a Parcel of imperfect Actors At last the Landlady declared she was sure and sorry that the Gentleman was so affronted and how do we know but he may be some Nobleman in Disguise of some great Man perhaps belonging to the Government  As sure as Saint  Winifred  and so he is reply'd the Squire of the Squareroot and one of our  Mary  's Relations  Mr  Illicit  with a Sneer enquired if  Mary  's Relations were all great People  Yes by God's Blessing and good Grace they are all so ay and have all Coats of Arms too as well as my Family  Unluckily the Lawyer interrupted him by observing that some People pretended to Coats of Arms yet wanted Arms to their Coats Flesh and Blood cou'd not bear this he flung his Fist full upon Mr  Illicit  's Face the astonish'd Lawyer started up like a Cock that's chained and darting his Arms out strait by way of keeping off Blows he entangled his Fingers in Mr  Aprice  's Hair  Aprice  rushing forward drove Mr  Illicit  into a Corner and there the Exciseman's Head like a battering Ram butted and rebut∣ted against the Lawyer's Chin The Welchman springing upon his Toes at every stroke Mr  Illicit  's Teeth gnash'd lamentably and the hinder Part of his Skull striking against the Wainscot sounded dismal  The Apothecary mounted himself by a Chair's Help on a Table at the other End of the Room with two Candles  in his Hands to see and show them fair PlayThe Landlord stole away to call the Exciseman's Wife and the Landlady stood shrieking clasping her Arms round a large  China  Bowl she had snatch'd up  In the Corner where the Heat of Bat∣tle roar'd happen'd to be a Vessel which for Delicacysake is named a Look∣ingglass Whether the Combatants overset the Vessel or the Vessel over∣threw them is yet undetermin'd Cer∣tain it is they were all three rolling on the Floor together but  Aprice  soon got astride Mr  Illicit  forcibly his Blows fell upon the Lawyer when Mrs  Aprice  entering came suddenly behind her Hus∣band seiz'd his Arms and obtain'd in an Instant a Cessation of Fists  The Doctor who had all this while manfully maintain'd his Post as Candlebearer to the Combatants now descend∣ed and proffer'd his Service to Mr  Illicit  chirurgicallybut the Lawyer swore he wou'dn't join Issue with any of umbut he wou'd have Revenge He'd let them see what it was to strike a sworn Attorney for all his Eyes were closed at present He was oblig'd to be led Home wet bruised and blinded The Landlady went out to obey Mr  Junior  's Order and the Gentleman of vulgar Fractions remain'd Master of the Field of Battle  The Distributer of Medicines then be∣gan to observe how wrongheaded Mr  Illicit  was in not suffering his Bruises to be dress'd hinting somewhat about Inflammations tumefy'd Flesh Fissures Fevers and Phlebotomy  Now it was said that Mr  Opifer  and Madam  Aprice  had been naught toge∣ther but that the Doctor was incon∣stant having Hopes to meet with a more agreeable Patient in the Landlady This Mrs  Aprice  had great Suspicion of She had long time kept herself to herself but now was resolv'd to give Vent to her Indignation  Her Husband had from what some∣times his Neighbours said great Jea∣lousies about his Wife and Mr  Opifer  and he also was then determin'd to have it out The Wife's Blood was up the Husband's Blood was up and after some Altercation they set Mr  Opi∣fer  's Blood up  He hit Madam in the Teeth with some Particulars which no Man cou'd be suppos'd to have known but her Hus∣bandShe flew at himhe fled from  her She seiz'd the Knots of his Tye Wig he left it in her Hands as a Bird escapes with the Loss of his Tailfeathers and run out of the Room the Husband and Wife after him they overtook him in the Entry the Exciseman be∣gan to beat him unmercifullyMrs  Aprice  seconded every Blow of her Hus∣band's by hitting the Wig in the Doc∣tor's Face who all the while was cry∣ing out Murder Murder for God's Sake The Ostler rescu'd him and he run Home like a true Tragedy Ghost bareheaded with Shirt bloody and mealy Face  Mr  Aprice  and his  Mary  went Home Arm in Arm She comforting herself that tho' his best Neckcloth was tore thank God her Husband had be∣hav'd himself like a Gentleman  CHAP VIII  NOW was Tranquility reinstated below Stairs and the Mistress of the House ascended to Mr  Junior  with a Bowl of Rack and began her Apo∣logy for the People's having made such an obstropulous Noise  Tho' for that Matter I'm glad Sir Mr  Illicit  met his Deserts for affront∣ing such a good temper'd Gentleman as you are tho' to be sure our Exciseman did thrash him vexatiously and yet I cou'dn't help being frighten'd Sirone's House being disturb'd so and then to see them all bloody and my best  China  Bowl had like to have been brokeand if I hadn't shriek'd out Sir and caught hold of it Sir my best Bowl wou'd have tumbled all to smash SirThus glib glided her Speech she lisp'd she laugh'd her Face was flush'd her Eyes glissen'd sure Symptoms that she had been too busy with her best  China  Bowl  Junior  observed it and resolv'd to try how far his Friend was right He put the Glass quick about he squeez'd her Hand he prais'd her Face he kiss'd her Lips he press'd her Neck he sigh'd  he stroveshe begg'd he'd be easy she must go downnay she vow'd she wou'dthat Momentwhat cou'd such a fine Gentleman see in hernay Sir pray don't pull meexcusedear what with a Stranger tooifSir indeedI'llthere's the Curtain Rod downO Lordthe Door wellnaySirpray oh oh Dies  ACT II  Next Morning  Junior  went to visit the Person he had so lately relieved If in her Wretchedness he discover'd she was handsome now neatly habited he cou'd not help loudly affirming upon Oath she was the most striking Figure he ever saw  Fixing her Eyes upon the Floor and fetching a deep Sigh she reply'd alass Sir forgive my Abruptness but if you'll condescend to hear my Story  Junior  bow'd and seating himself by her thus she began  I hope Sir you'll excuse me if for the present I don't mention my Name But few Years are past since I was counted the Toast and great Heiress of the County my Father represented in Par∣liament  As you know Sir it is impos∣sible for a young Woman of Fashion to compleat her Education but under a  French  Governess I had one who soon gain'd me to think her the most polite friendly and sensible Creature living She made me despise my own Country and setting all those who came to pay their Addresses to me in a contemptible Light and every Time she stood by me at my Dressingtable lamented that such Beauty as I was possess'd of shou'd be made a Sacrifice to some rude coarse  English  Savage  I sigh'd for  France  began to fancy myself choak'd with the foggy Air of  England  for as Madamoiselle told me if I was at  Paris  it wou'd be a very easy Thing for me to make a Conquest of one of the Princes of the Blood You must be certain my  English  Lovers did not meet with much Encouragement Nay I disbanded them all but one whose Name was  Soil  he wou'd take no De∣nial He had the greatest Estate in our Neighbourhood and the Relations on each Side desired it to be a Match There∣fore they contriv'd it so that sometimes I was forc'd to suffer myself of sit with him But you wou'd have smil'd to have seen our Tete a Tete Parties when∣ever  he offer'd to speak I met his Eyes with a full StareHe stammer'd and blush'd like a Schoolboythen I us'd to burst into a loud Laugh and he'd hang down his Head turn round his Dog's Collar putting the Buttend of his Whip into his Mouth as an Infant does its Coral play'd the Lash of it against his Boots at the same Time I was pinching my Apron or twirling my Watch Key  One Day indeed he ventur'd so far to open his Mind as to invite me to see him ride a SweepstakesMy reply was I detested HorseracingHe look'd as simple as a ShepherdI told him if I was ever again to be punished with his Company I desir'd he wou'd not bring any of his Brother Brutes with him not but I assur'd him pointing to his Greyhound I thought the Dog a much more sensible Animal than his Master  He started up look'd round the Room as if he had lost something clapp'd his Cap on smack'd his Whip whistled his Dog out bounced the Door after him and got on Horsback cursing himself if he ever open'd after me again  However resolving not to be thrown out as he said by a Puss he determin'd to demand me in Form and of myself too But preparing himself with rather  too many Bumpers to deliver so im∣portant a Question he made his At∣tack upon my Woman in so boisterous a Manner that I was forced to leave my Dressingroom to rescue her This Story I related in all the Places I visited with several Embellishments placing him in so ridiculous a Light that he was forc'd to leave the Country vowing Revenge against mebut that I thought so tri∣fling to take Notice ofmy Heart was set upon  France  and I soon persuaded my Mama to spend the following Win∣ter with me in  Paris  One Day when every Thing was got ready for the intended Tour Mr Re∣corder's Daughter a young Lady about my Age came to tell me what a Won∣der was come to Town  A fine Gentleman she said an out∣landish one his Servants had Feathers in their Hats and himself was all over Gold Lace  The Mention of a Foreigner alarm'd me my Heart beat impatient to make so important a Conquest The very Day of his Arrival was our Subscription Assembly He danc'd with meand I learn'd from his own Mouth he was a  French  NoblemanHow inimitable I thought was every Thing he did so odd  so out of the way so polite so easy all the young Ladies were charm'd with him as much as I was but I had the Satisfaction of triumphing over them all for it was to me alone he paid his Addresses He prais'd my Figure my Dancing my Understanding I cou'd have heard him for ever But when he waited on me Home judge Sir what such a giddyheaded Girl as I must feel to see him kneel at my Feet and hear him name the Dames of the first Quality and Beauty in  France  and swear I was in point of Person superior to them all  When he took his Leave all in Rap∣ture I made my Governess sit with me for two Hours talking about him while shebegg'd me not to be too cre∣dulousnor fix my Affections on a Stranger 'Tis true she said he had the Air of Nobility yet he might be a Sharper for all that and begg'd I wou'd not give him the least Encou∣ragement till she had enquired into the Truth of what he was  I was charm'd with this fresh Assu∣rance of what I thought the most sincere Friendship but I reply'd her Care was needless I was certain by his Address he must be a Man of FashionThat did not signify she answer'd several  young Ladies had been ruin'd by For∣tunehunters and it was her Duty to take Care of me and she wou'd go that Day and be convinc'd  When return'd from her Enquiry she congratulated me on the Conquest I had made for she knew my Lord's Gentle∣man in  Paris  and he assured her his Master was violently in Love with me  That Afternoon my Lord drank Tea with me I shall not trouble you with our Courtship indeed there was not much But prompted by my Governess I agreed to go off with him which in four Days from our first Acquaintance I did  I had a pretty considerable Fortune independant When we arrived at  Lon∣don  that I drew out of the Bank put into my Husband's Hands and the next Day set forward for  France  You may easily guess Sir the Cata∣strophe of this AmourHe plunder'd and left me informing me by a Letter that he was sent down by Mr  Soil  on pur∣pose to make his Addresses to me and that after I had received his Visits  Soil  wou'd come down and expose me by discovering my Gallant that I had pre∣ferr'd to be only a Waiter at  White  'sBut this Fellow who was really a  French∣man  was too cunning for us both and went off with my Governess with whom I have since discover'd he had concert∣ed the Plan when she went to enquire after him  That Instant the Beadle opening the Door interrupted her Narration say∣ing that his Worship Muster chief Constable must speak with them both this Minute  Junior  desiring the Lady not to be uneasy went with the Beadle but called of Mr  Saltern  by the Way to inform him of the Headborough's Message  Mr  Saltern  who happen'd to know the Magistrate and his Family begg'd  Junior  to pay a particular Regard to the chief Constable's SisterShe was always present at all Examinations and took vast State upon her  Junior  promis'd him he wou'd and instantly went towards his Worship's yet he cou'd not help wondering what the Magistrate wanted with himThe Reader perhaps may have the same Cu∣riosityWe will satisfy himbut it must be in the next Chapter  CHAP IX  MR  Illicit  's Bruises not suffering him to sleep he lay ruminating how this Beating might be made pro∣fitable He felt himself very sore and wou'd have SmartmoneyBut in the midst of his Pains he had the Pleasure of thinking  Aprice  's Wife and five Chil∣dren shou'd come to the Parish  But how to get Money by all thisHe recollected the Fight began about a strange Gentlemantherefore he de∣creed the strange Gentleman was the Aggressor Ay and the strange Gen∣tleman shou'd pay Costs because if the strange Gentleman had not been there the Quarrel wou'd not have happen'd  But how to prove DamagesThe Woman  Junior  reliev'd came into his Head something may be made of that The Thought pleas'd him he forgot his Aches got up put on his Banyan and without staying for his Breakfast went to his Brotherinlaw's his Worship aforemention'd  Mr  Oatley  the Magistrate had been a  London  Chairman and plied at St  James  's but marrying a Publican's Wi∣dow  who kept a Nightcellar they left off Business being well to pass and came down into the Country to settle near his Brotherinlaw's And being as he declared brought up at Court which he took care to let every body know when he first came down in the Country tho' not what Character he acted was look'd upon among his Neighbours as a very extraordinary sort of a Man and invited to a great many rich People's Houses for he cou'd tell all about St  James  's and the Royal Fa∣mily knew to an Hour how old my Lord Duke was to the tenth of an Inch how high my Lady  Jane  's Shoes were what colour'd Silk the Dutchess's Chair was lined with when such a Countess cut her Nails what Snuff the Prince used and how the King's Shoemaker took Measure of his Majesty  Mr  Oatly  had not heard of the Fray and was surprised to see his Brother's Eyes black his Face swell'd and Lip with a Patch on'tHe began to won∣der at such a Sight and observ'd such Things were never suffer'd at Court  Mr  Illicit  Look ye Brother these Things shall appear at Court in a Court of Law too I had like to have been murder'd by  that Rascal  Aprice  and two or three more of them but I'll do for that Excise Fellow I warrant himbut that a'ant all Here are two Sharpers come to Town they put up at the Crown one of um pretends to keep his Bed by a Fall and t'other has pick'd up a Mi∣stress and there's some Scheme in it  Mr  Oatley  Like enough like enough I've met with such Things at Court very often  Illicit  Now you must know Brother I'd have you send for this Fellow and exa∣mine him and the Woman too for he gave her five Guineas Yesterday and this is a Case requires explaining  Oatley  Nay this is extraordinary for when I was at Court we us'd to observe where Money was given there was always some MysteryTherefore the Chief dispatch'd his Beadle for  Junior  imme∣diately  Just as the Messenger went out Ma∣dam  Illicit  enter'd and the Moment she saw her Brother and Husband she points to her Spouse's Face crying out here's a pretty Figure for youthis is keep∣ing Company with Strumpetsyes Bro∣ther my Husband is now always at the  Crown  with that brazenface Landlady and so I suppose some of her Bullies beat him  The Husband call'd for Silence the Brother call'd for Silence but neither his Worship's Authority nor the Autho∣rity of Mr  Illicit  were equal in Power to her Voice she stamp'd she roar'd she scoldedThey stood staring mo∣tionless as if unawares they had glanc'd on  Medusa  's Head till her Breath Voice and Spirits being exhausted she sunk like an expiring Heroine mute into a Chair  Just then the Beadle introduc'd  Ju∣nior  saying that Gentleman is his Wor∣ship Sir with one Eye  Junior  Sir I receiv'd a Message to come be∣fore you but shou'd be glad to know what Right you have to send for me or any other Gentleman as suspicious Persons  Madam  Illicit  Yes Sir my Brother has a Right he's a Magistrate  Mr  Chief  Pray give me Leave SisterhemhemSirI have had the Honour of belonging to Court many Years there∣fore  do you see I know Right and Wrong Sir  Junior  By all Means Sir but give me Leave Sir first to plead my Excuse in not pay∣ing a proper Respect to that Lady who I am certain I have had the Pleasure of seeing at St  James  's for there is an Air inseparable to true Quality which Coun∣try Ladies may endeavour to imitate but never can come up to  Madam  Illicit  bridling up her Head gave him a slow low Curtesy wink'd upon her Brother turn'd up her Nose at her Husband and with contracted Mouth lisp'd out she was sorry her Brother shou'd send for so polite a Gentleman so  Mellopropo  To be sure the Town Air was to be observ'd with half an Eye both in Ladies and Gentlemen except it was by some People who had a Look at Mr  Illicit  no Taste and could pre∣fer lowlif't Innkeepers Wives to Per∣sons who had suck'd in the Court Air with their Milk  Mr  Illicit  who sat chewing the Cud of Resentment told his Brotheryou know you have a Right of Examination I say and insist on't that not only this Person be ask'd to give an Account of himself but  Junior  Pray Sir in which of the Statutes  Illicit  Pray what do you know of the Sta∣tutes Ha  Mr  Chief  Hold Brother as you say I have a Right of Examination why do you pre∣tend to examine any body before me  Illicit  Brother this is out of your Way  Mr  Chief  What's out of my Way ha You are a very pretty Fellow indeed to say Exami∣nation is out of my Way ask my Cha∣racter at Court  Illict  You don't understand me Brother  Mr  Chief  I hope Sir I have as much Under∣standing as you and have kept better Company  A Note just then came from Mr  Sal∣tern  directed to the chief Constable the Contents were as follows  Mr  Oatley  I wou'd have you be ex∣treamly cautious concerning your Pro∣ceeding against the Gentleman at pre∣sent before youHe is travelling in cog and is one of the Lord's of the Bed∣chamber  to his present MajestyI'll bail him for Twentythousand Pounds  Yours  Saltern  Mrs  Illicit  was leaning over the Back of his Worship's Chair to read the Note when Mr  Oatley  rising hasty his Head met her Forehead it whisk'd her round and down she sunk This the Chief never minded but kept bowing and complimenting  Junior  desiring him to take the arm'd ChairThe Attor∣ney star'd like a Man just gorg'd with a large BumperHis Brother turning about told him he was sorry to say it but he was a very impertinent Fellowfor all you're my Brotherand I hope my Lordyou are a very impudent Dog SirrahI ask ten thousand Par∣dons my LordMr  Illicit  's Spouse who had by this Time recover'd her Sen∣ses from the Blow and was rising up to reak her Revengebut hearing the Word Lord mention'dshe smooth'd her Capshook her Petticoatsand sideling round simpering she ask'd his Lordship's Pardon for her Husband's Illmannerdness and hoped his Honour wou'd accept of Mr  Illicit  's asking his Honour's Pardon  Junior  who grew tired of the Farce insisted on no more Mention to be made  of it and took his Leave The chief Magistrate and Madam the chief Ma∣gistrate's Sister ushering him to the Door with Bows Curtsies Apologies Prayers and Praisesthe Attorney walking backwards and forwards all the Time almost frantic like an outlaw'd Smug∣gler just takenThere let them rest while we attend the more interesting Scenes of this Miscellany  CHAP X  THE Head and the Heart are di∣stinct Organs A Writer therefore in his Address to each shou'd vary his Manner and Matter But as the Editor acknowledges himself but indifferently provided with Head he begs Leave to continue this History in the same Stile it began and hopes the Reader will accept of an unbellish'd Relation of what befel the Lady after  Junior  's De∣parture  For some Moments she sat silent her Hands cross'd upon her Knees lost in ThoughtA loud wrap at the Door rouz'd her in burst a Shoal of Ladies  ruralbredno Apologyfor in the Country Familiarity is the Grammar of good Manners  They had all the Morning flirted from House to House and Snowball like gathered as they went forwardsall agog to hear what the two Gentlemen were who the Woman was and who father'd the Child  After they had collected the whole Troop of Femaleinquisitors it was  nem con  agreed to pay Goody  Wen  a Visit and ask her new Lodger several Que∣stions They enter'd crowding gig∣gling staring and curtsying all speak∣ing togetherI hope no  London  ac∣complish'd Lady will be offended at my Supposition that the Female Folks of Country Hamlets may be a little in Taste  I have heard it asserted how true it is I know not but that in some Coun∣try Towns there are broad Starers loud Talkers scandal Spreaders deep In∣triguers keen Gamesters husband Ha∣ters religion Scoffers  c c c c  Indeed ye true townbred Toasts as ye have not a Patent for your several high Qualificationswhy shou'd you wholly possess themYe do notthey  have found their Way into the Country as well as flounc'd Petticoats  Just as they had address'd the strange Lady  Junior  return'd and put an End to the scrutinising Party They look'd a little silly or so begg'd Pardon made several short Curtsies like  Mayday  Milkmaids huddled to the Door each striving to be first out as if the House was on Fire and tittering whispering pushing pinching and shrieking run into the Street like Schoolboy's in breakingup Time leaving the Lady to continue her Relation uninterrupted  Continuation of the Lady's Story  At a Place call'd  Chantilly  was I left without a second Necessary and but a single Guinea in the whole World I acquainted the Landlady with my Misfortunes she endeavoured to com∣fort me and the next Morning came to let me know that there was an  English  Gentleman who desir'd to be introduc'd to me  How did I rejoice to hear there was any of my own Country there I who had so lately despised every Person in it So true it is what in Prosperity we most  slight in Adversity we first fly to for Succour  As soon as I had sufficiently recover'd myself the Gentleman waited upon me offer'd me his Sword his Fortune to make me easylet me know he was a Man of Fashion and begg'd Leave he might have the Honour of conducting me to  England  or where else I thought fit  There was something I thought so no∣ble in his Manner I accepted of his Offers and he attended me to  Dover  From thence I wrote to an elderly Lady an Aunt the only Friend I cou'd de∣pend uponFor she had in her Youth suffered for her Fondness for your Sex and was therefore most likely to pity my Indiscretion  Being oblig'd to wait for an Answer the Gentleman who came over with me begg'd Leave to visit me while I staid thereI cou'd not refuse him his Be∣haviour was most respectful his Con∣versation very engaging his Actions so disinterested and his Expressions so very tender I esteem'd himAh when once a Lady thinks highly of any of any of your Sex it is the Gallant's Fault if he does not receive the last Proof of it  This Sir was my CaseOut of Gra∣titude I confess'd to him he was not  indifferent to me but he wanted imme∣diately rudely to avail himself by that Ac∣knowledgmentThus Mankind behave generally to eager or too insensible sel∣dom knowing how to make a proper Use of our Concessions What I in∣tended as a Present to his Disinterested∣ness he wanted to command by an Act of Powerhe was deceivedhe lost me by the Scheme that he laid to possess me  I escapedrefused to see him and the next Day he arrested me for Money laid out for my Use An Answer to the Letter which I had sent arrived that ve∣ry Day and seasonably relieved me unexpectedly for my Creditor I paid his Demands and set off without seeing him for my Relations  Lady  Veltry  was one of those very good Ladies who dedicate most Part of their Time to the making up and ad∣ministring Medicines to the Poor and I had not any better Amusement than like a Pupil at the Hospitals to attend upon her  This I soon grew fatigued withthen I used to weary myself with sauntering backwards and forwards under a long Elmwalk Rookery Visiters we had none and as to Books all that her La∣dyship would allow in her Library treat∣ed  upon Drugs and Diseases and the se∣veral Symptoms of each Distemper yet even these for Want of Employment I began to read over but the Effects they had on me were terrible not a Dis∣ease they mentioned but what I soon fancied I was attacked with  The first Volume I turned over was a Treatise upon Cancers and the very next Day I happened to have a Pain in my Breast which alarmed me a Discourse upon Consumptions cured me of my Concer but then I dreaded an Ulcer upon my Lungs those Prognostics were removed by an Account of the Gravel which made me expect a Fit of the Stone A Volume of dropsical Cases fell next into my Hands they dissolved the Stone indeed but fixed me in a very watry Statebut a Book concerning the Eyes restored me to Health tho' it gave me great Reasons to fear a  Gutta Serena  I was obliged to leave off reading for Fear of its being prejudicial to my Sight and just then Lady  Veltry  's only Son ar∣rived from  Italy  As soon as I saw him I felt an Uneasiness I could not account for at first I only imagined it to be a Compassion for his Youth  He had a Delicacy of Figure that I am certain would prejudice any of my Sex that saw him in his Favour I often pitied him in secret to think what Dan∣gers from the Debaucheries of  London  a Gentleman of his Rank Fortune and Spirits was exposed to  But I soon was alarmed at my own Condition Involuntary Sighs sudden Flushings Palpitations of the Heart unaccountable Anxiety and Tremors Days wasted without breaking my Fast and Nights without Sleep the Symp∣toms frightened me I flew to my Phy∣sic Books but could not find my Case in any one Author  A Self Examination proved I was in Love I thought I had been so with that  French  Impostor but found now that was only Price I had never before suffered those tender Sensations those Uproars I then every Day experienced I delighted in the Discovery and in∣dulged my Distemper consulted my Glass and was assured by that Oracle I should succeed but I lost my Time I despised both him and myself him for his Insensibility me for my Want of Power  A few Days after his Arrival as we were sitting at Breakfast the Conversa∣tion  happened to turn upon Love and Beauty He very carelessly declared he looked upon Love only as a poetical Rattle invented to amuse overgrown Boys and Girls with and as to beauti∣ful Women they were like  Dresden  China pretty Pieces of ornamental Fur∣niture I was choaked could scarcely keep my Seat but Lady  Veltry  not be∣ing so immediately concerned in the Re∣flection as I was had Power to go on desiring him to be explicit concerning Matrimony hoping she told him to see him wed before she died to his and her Wishes  He fixed his Eyes full on her Face shrugged up his Shoulders starting from his Seat and turning round with such a Smile as some Ladies express Hate by he replied dear Mem you're vastly good and I'm immensely obliged to you It is become quite the Thing to be sure for Men of Fashion to be hum∣med into one Piece of Folly or another I am not to be out of Taste I find positively my Lady I doat upon your Advice And as I find marrying and keeping a Pack of Hounds are much practised at present I believe I may mortify myself so far as to build a Dog's Kennelbut as to Matrimonyno  I'll not come into the Buckbasket And turning upon his Heel left the Room singing Part of a Concerto  We looked upon one another like two Travellers who had lost their Way I began to entertain a mighty Contempt for his Understanding yet I admired his Figure I was certain he was a Fool yet I could not help loving him Men of many Words may reconcile this Pa∣radox all I can say is I felt it to be true  When I retired to my Chamber I found a thousand Excuses for his Beha∣viour I recollected an Intimacy a ve∣ry particular one between this Gentle∣man and the Person who pass'd for his Valet they dressed much alike they were not unlike in Figure The Valet never sorted with the rest of the Servants and several Expressions his Master made use of to him made me conclude that this Servant was some young Lady whom he had stole from a Nunnery I had often read of such Things and that it was owing to this Connection he seemed so averse to Marriage  Lovers Sir altho' they may be mis∣taken in Point of Judgment are gene∣rally very quicksighted at least so we are apt to flatter ourselves As soon as  I had made this Discovery I enjoyed greatly my Penetration I exulted on the Sagacity I fansied myself possessed of I pitied the young Lady wanted sadly to hear her Story and resolved gene∣rously to make a Sacrifice of my Passion to my Rival  With this noble Disposition I went to sleepPity indeed we cannot be so dispassionate or irresolute as we wish to be All my fine Flights of Disinterest∣edness vanished in the Morning and as soon as I saw the Valet I wished the Creature out of the House  That very Afternoon as I was in my Dressingroom I heard in an adjoining Chamber Lady  Veltry  's Son and his Valet a Division in the Wainscot gave me an Opportunity of seeing them with∣out their discovering it I could not resist the Temptation of looking thro' the Cre∣vice there I saw them embrace each other with vast Fondness my Conjectures were then past doubt but good God in a few Minutes after excuse me Sir turning my Face away I found the Wretches to be both of the same Sex Shocked and trembling I hurried out of the Room rushed down Stairs and at the Bottom I fell into a fainting Fit One of our Servants luckily crossing the  Hall at that Moment recovered me Too detestable is this Subject to dwell up∣on I told what I had seen and the Pair of  Catamites  were seized When Lady  Veltry  's Son came before her La∣dyship so far from being daunted at the Discovery he gloried in it pro∣nounced it superb Taste and pretended to vindicate himself by vast Fashion and high Examples  Lady  Veltry  would not hear him pro∣ceed ordered him out of her Sight took to her Bed immediately and in four Days Time without ever suffering her Son to come near her died in my ArmsBut here the Lady was inter∣rupted by the following Accident  CHAP XI  AFTER the Departure of  Junior  from the chief Constable's Ma∣dam  Illicit  whose Penetration could ne∣ver enough be admired discovered they had affronted a Lord and that as how they mought be all ruined suppos∣ing he had a Mind to sue them for  Scrambulum matum  Scandalum magnatum  you mean my Dear her Spouse replied very good na∣turedly but sometimes it is unlucky to set Folks right She began upon her Husband saying it was all his doing by following of his Whores and Strumpets Had not Mr  Illicit  very prudently left the Room upon the first Prognostic of the approaching Tempest it might have been of fatal Consequence fatal at least to every Thing brittle about the Room Madam  Illicit  being one of the best tem∣pered Women in the World but rather too hot and she would in her Heat of Passion throw any Thing that came in her Waybut then it was soon over and she was very sorry for it afterwards as indeed all hasty People generally are Her Anger was ended the Moment her Spouse made his Retreat She begged her Brother's Pardon for being in a Pas∣sionbut vowed she would for her own Family's Sake go and wait upon my Lord's Lady for Fear worse should come on't  Mr  Oatley  approved her Intention  But first she strictly enjoined her Brother to Secresy concerning the whole Affair Herein imitating some of the mighty Men who make Lawsnot for themselves indeed they act  ad Libitum  Thus this Lady tho' she positively in∣sisted upon her Brother's not opening his Lips about it yet she could not help calling at three or four Neighbours Houses to let them know what a Blun∣derbuss her Husband had been and as how my Lord knew her the Moment she came into the Room and that she was sent for to drink Tea with his Lordship and the Lady and that she knew who the Lady was and all about herbut thank God she was no Blab and how if it hadn't been for her knowing my Lord my Lord would have ruined her Brother and her Husband for affronting his Lordship but that my Lord was her intimate Acquaintance  Just as Madam  Illicit  came to Goo y  Wen  's Door where  Junior  was earnestly attending to the fair Unfortunate's Nar∣ration she met Mr  Seap  one of the Parish Officers who was coming to pay the strange Lady a Visit but not out of an idle unwarrantable or impertinent Curiosity no  Junior  's Liberality had been mentioned all over the Town and according to ancient gossipping Custom was encreased by arithmetical Progres∣sionTherefore Mr  Seap  having the Good of his Parish at Heart came to wait upon the Gentleman to know concerning  the Woman and the Child not that he imagined they would increase the Town's Poorrates but Accidents that might happen ought to be provided a∣gainst besides as the Gentleman was known to be so generous a Gentleman it was doing his Duty to try at least if by threatening the Wench about Secu∣rity he could not get  Junior  to make him a Present for the Benefit of the Parish  Seneca  observes doing Duty is duplex  There is a Duty we owe our Neigh∣bours and a Duty we owe ourselves  Now to attempt one of these Duties Mr  Seap  came invested with an Autho∣rity to punish or protect as Justice should find it right necessary equitable and best For Justicebut here I must beg Leave to observe that the Symbols of Justice and  Janus  are quite wrong and that they should be shifted  For as every Schoolboy knows the Temple of  Janus  was relative to War and Peace  Janus  should certainly be blindfolded to shew that War is sometimes but a Game of Blindman'sbuff and in Peacemaking we should take Care not to be hoodwink'd  Justice should wear two Faces one to smile at her Friends with the other to frown upon her Enemies  The Utility Erudition and Occasion of this Digression will be a sufficient Atonement for its Introduction  As the Superintendant of the Work∣house was going to lift up the Latch the Lawyer's Lady seized him by the Cuff of his Coat and in a very hasty Sort of a Tone demanded to know what he wanted in that House  Seap  I come Madam to look after some Parish Business  Madam  Then I insist upon knowing what that Parish Business is for I and my Hus∣band should know because I and my Husband do most of the Parish Business  Seap  But Madam this is concerning a Woman and a Child and you can have no Business  Madam  How Sirrah do you think me past Childbearing You RascalI no Bu∣siness with Children  Junior  was that In∣stant opening the Door to know what was the Matter when at the very Mo∣ment backwards Mr  Seap  fell into the House driven down by a violent Blow on the Nose given him by Madam  Il∣licit  for his Imporence as she said to contradict her in so vulgar a Manner  Like a Corpse ready for the Coroner's Inquest Mr  Seap  lay all at his Length on his Back cross the Brickfloor which his Head had hit hard against But Madam  Illicit  regardless of his Fate straddled athwart him unconcerned and addressed herself to  Junior  and the Lady with  I beg your Honour's Pardon my Lord and her Ladyship's Honour's Pardon but this Fellor was a coming to insult your Honour's and your Ladyship's Honour's ChildShe was going on im∣patient to express herself curtsying at every other Word to shew her Breeding when poor  Seap  in one of her Sinkings seized her by the Gowntail and cut short her Compliments by pulling her bump upon his Breast  He lay breathless for some Time with the Blow and she sat speechless for some Time upon him staring wildly con∣founded at her Disgrace but  Junior  who new enough of her Temper to judge what must become of the Victim underneath her lifted her up and led her to her Ladyship then assisted the Parish Officer and by the friendly In∣terposition of the strange Lady my  Lord's Authority Mr  Seap  's Submis∣sion and three or four Glasses of ge∣nuine Coniac Madam  Illicit  returned Home in good Humour and Mr  Seap  with her leaving the Lady at Leisure to go on with her Adventures  The Story of the Lady continued  I fear Sir my Tale is already grown tiresome the Remainder of it I doubt you will think more so since I shall be obliged to mention several Facts wherein the Vanity and Ingratitude of Mankind are conspicuousFrom what already I had known of your Sex you must not suppose they could be much in my Es∣teem and what afterwards happened to me corroborated the Contempt I en∣tertained for them and was as I then thought a sufficient Excuse for the Manner in which afterwards they were treated by me I wish what I have suf∣fered might deter others from too much indulging the strong Sallies of their Imagination and by my Example would remember that they who attempt to make others ridiculous always lay themselves open to Revenge  All that Lady  Veltry  could leave from her Son she gave me and after her  Decease in Money Bills and Jewels I found myself worth upwards of five thousand Pounds As soon as the Fune∣ral was over I sat out for  London  A Wheel of my Chaise giving Way on the Road I put up at Noontime at an Inn a single House upon the Bench before the Door I saw a very neat dressed young Woman sit crying her Arms had some black and blue Marks on them and her Cap and Hat was in Dis∣order I enquired of the Bystanders what was the Reason of her Distress They told me her Husband had been beating her and just at the Instant he came back a black illlooking Fellow I asked him mildly the Reason of his using so prettya young Creature so barba∣rously He replied surlily she was his Wife and no Body had any Business with her but himself However I at last by giving him some Money paci∣fied him I took such a Fancy to the young Woman that I brought her to Town and kept her with me She had been educated by her Parents on Purpose to go into Place as an upper Servant her Father was a Jailor where this Fel∣low of her's had been committed for smuggling nay outlaw'd she tookPi∣ty of him helped him to make his  Escape and went off with him They had been rambling about the Country for six Months he was a Tinker and she was very ingenious she made and sold artificial Flowers at the Gentlemen and Farmers Houses about the Country But in the last Town they came from a very rich Man wanted to be rather too familiar with her she repulsed him but her Lover would not give it over went to her Husband and proffered him a Sum of Money to sell his WifeThe Fellow consented and the Blows she had received were because she would not comply This Relation I could not help entering in my Account Courant against your Sex and yet I own Sir I wished to meet with some Incidents that would make me think better of Man∣kind  In the Afternoon a Man on Horse∣back called to my Postillion to stop but just as he came up to the Chaise his Crape dropped from his Face and I knew him to be one of Lady  Veltry  's Servants who had been discharged about two Months before I then thought there was some Injustice in his Dismis∣sion and I remember at his taking Leave of me I put a Moidore in his Hand and to his Gratitude I imputed  my not being robbed by him The next Morning my Servant came to tell me that he was sure he saw the Highway∣man in the Yard that stopped the Chaise Yesterday and asked my Leave to have him taken up I was shocked at the News and ordered him on his Peril not to say a Word but sent my Woman with him down Stairs to find the poor Wretch out and bid him get off They did so and it gave me great Ease when they told me of it for I dreaded if he was seized that I must have taken an Oath in a Court of Justice upon Life and Death That Action I knew would sit heavy upon my Mind as long as I livedto be accessary in hanging any Person even tho' they deserved it was what I could not reconcile to my∣self It may be looked on as a foolish Woman's Prejudice but I can no more get over it than several of your Sex can their Tremblings at Cats Cheese and many other Antipathies  That Evening as I sat at Supper I received a Letter directed to me It sur∣prized me how any Person could send me a Letter as I was upon a Journey but I could hardly fancy myself awake or in my right Senses when I found it  was from the Wretch who but that Morning I cautioned to make his Es∣capeand that it was a Loveletter tooI read it over so often it is not easy for me to forget it He began with hoping my Honour wasn't fright∣ened when he came up to the Chaise for he wouldn't hurt a Hair of my Head for all the World hoped I would par∣don his Boldness in breaking his Mind to me That to be sure he never could have had the Boldness to think that so fine a Lady as I was could have liked him so very much not but that his Fel∣low Servants used to say when he lived at Lady  Veltry  's that young Madam meaning me took his Part very much but to be sure Madamthus the Wretch went on when you put the Moi∣dore in my Hand as I was leaving my Place I thought you gave my Hand a Squeeze and you have run in my Head ever since and when Yesterday the young Woman told me you advised me to get off I was pretty sure you had ta∣ken a Fancy to me so was resolved to let you know it Tho' I have wore a Livery Gentlewomen put up with that and as to my taking the Road what can a Man do that has been used to live well without Working And there's  Cheating in all Trades and every Body allows the Highway is as much a Gen∣tleman's Profession as playing at Cards  You may suppose Sir the Answer I sent himI never saw my Lover any morebut I kept his Letter as a Mas∣terpiece of human Vanity  As soon as I arrived in  London  I be∣gan to put my intended Schemes in Ex∣ecution of making your Sex my Dupes I did so I used my Lovers as some Sportsmen do Game lure hunt and toil them But  The Waiter from the Inn came just then to let the Gentleman know Mr  Saltern  desired his Company to Dinner which was taking up and begged Mr  Junior  would bring the Lady with him  Junior  immediately went with the Waiter the Lady promised to follow after Dinner was over During the Meal  Jack  let his Friend into as much of the Lady's History as he knew and then went to Goody  Wen  's to escort her to the Inn As soon as Mr  Saltern  saw her he could not help saying  a Beauty indeed  Mr  Junior  told the Lady he had related to Mr  Saltern  all the preceding Part of her Historyupon which as there were only them three pre∣sent she thus concluded her Adventures  What a Multitude of ridiculous Ac∣tions I did occasion several very wise Lo∣vers to commit  I must say this in Praise of Under∣standing Sapience Knowledge or what∣ever other Title learned Folks know it by that I found those my greatest Dupes who imagined themselves too mighty to be made Fools of Your real Coxcombs Dunces and Imperti∣nents I could do nothing withFow∣lers might as well attempt to follow wild Geese by their Track Yet let me do your Sex so far Justice Ingratitude is not solely confined to the Masculine Genderfor my Woman who had been my Confident in all my Schemes nay my Agent in most whom I had rescued from the Blows of that Outlawshe Gentlemen revenged your Sex  For when I grew to be tired of mak∣ing Mankind my Maygame she advis∣ed me to MatrimonyI had often thought of it myself and upon her Recommendation admitted a rich  West India  Merchant just arrived from  Ja∣maica  to pay his Addresses to me Oh Gentlemen they who will deceive ought to be deceived in their Turns I was so and not to tire you with dull  commonplace Repetitions I was a se∣cond Time trepanned  Afterwards but too late indeed I found out the Villainy My Woman had met in  London  her Fellow whom I had rescued her from and he persuad∣ed her to be concerned in this Confede∣racy against me They dressed up one of their Gang in a proper Habit and introduced to me as a  West Indian  Sure Villainy must severely suffer in the next World it meets with so much Success in this We were married and on my Husband's praising the Island of  Ja∣maica  to me and the vast Profits that were made there by  English  Merchan∣dize he persuaded me to go with him draw my Money out of the Stocks and lay it out in Trade We went over from  Parkgate  to  Dublin  where one of his Ships lay as he told me Indeed he carried me on board a very handsome Ship where I was treated with the ut∣most Civility and lay in the great Ca∣bin that Night But Gentlemen think what my Surprize must be in the Morn∣ing to find myself when I woke in the Arms of a Stranger After much strug∣gling I sprung from him but I had no where to shelter myself the Ship I found was under Sail and I was sent for a Slave  to the Plantations The Captain of the Vessel which was indeed a Ship that carried such unhappy Wretches over told me that I was represented to him as a common Woman of the Town that the Gentleman I came on board with was to be married to a great For∣tune but I persecuted him so there was no Way of making two Families happy but by contriving to get me out of the WayI asked after my Trunks He shewed me a Chest which was left for meI had it broke open and instead of Cloaths it was filled with Straw Sticks and Stones  This the Captain told me opened his Eyes and he believed that I was ill usedbut as the Wind was fair should he alter his Course to set me upon Shore his Owners would ruin him but he would take Care of me he swore and begged Pardon for getting to Bed to me but since what was done could not be undone he supposed there was no Harm he said if I and he stowed in the same Birth together  What could I do Gentlemen in these most wretched Circumstances He ad∣ded that when I came to the  West Indies  I should live like a Lady that he would bring me safe back again and that if it  cost him all he was worth in the World he would find out the Villains who had wronged me  For the Remainder of the Voyage we lived together and when the Ship came into Harbour he fulfilled his Promise of behaving to me like a ManHe sold me for a three Years indented Ser∣vant having persuaded me to sign a Paper before he went ashore which he said was necessary for both our Securities to his Owners  You may wonder perhaps Mr  Ju∣nior  how I had a Fortitude of Mind sufficient to endure such Shocks as these were Indeed Gentlemen I cannot boast of what your Sex calls Stoicism I don't know whether I am right in the Word or no but I mean that Phi∣losophic Armour of Indifference in which the famous Men of former Times are said to have given Battle to the Pas∣sions  Yet our Sex has a Shield that is our sure Defence when we please to make Use of it It is Spiritand a Lady's Spirit like a King's Prerogative is ab∣solute we will do what we please with it  I was taken by a Widow Lady a Tawnymoor to be her Waitingwo∣man I had an easy Place of it only  now and then I was a little puzzled a∣bout chusing Ribbands to suit her Com∣plexionYou smile Gentlemen up∣on my Honour it is true Tho' her Face Neck and Arms were exactly a Copper Colour she spent three Hours every Day at her Dressingtable but these  Mu∣lattos  are much more affected than  Europeans  at least I fancy if in  Eng∣land  any illfavoured Persons should take Pains to ornament their Faces they would be stared at as Prodigies of Va∣nity vastly odd Creatures and such as don't appear above once in a Century  My Mistress tho' very old as well as intolerably ugly was incredibly rich several Persons even of the best Fami∣lies upon the Island paid their Addresses to her in this too I hope we differ from them  One Afternoon as I was sitting by myself in the Diningroom a Gentle∣man who was the greatest Favorite my Mistress had came behind me softly and before I was aware throwing his Arms round my Neck gave me three or four Kisses the first and the last Time he ever served me so the old Lady entered that Moment and took immediately such an Antipathy to me that she was resolved to have me poisoned those  Things are often and very easily done there  Had it not been for an  Englishman  one of the Overseers of her Slaves I had died a Victim to her Jealousy By his Means tho' it was attended with in∣numerable Difficulties I made my Es∣cape off the Island He took me with him to  Hispaniola  from whence we sail∣ed for  England  but on the  Cornish  Shore our Ship was lost and tho' we sav'd se∣veral Things of Value out of the Wreck the Country People came down Wo∣men as well as Men and plundered us of them all  I wonder those Things are suffered in such a Kingdom as  England  is I am no Politician but really believe our Legi∣slators know not that such Things are practis'd or if they have heard of them fansy them to be so much exaggerated they are not worth attending to  Mr  Saltern  I have heard that a Clause concerning the preserving of Properties in the Case of Shipwrecks is to be tacked to the Bill for Preservation of the Game throughout  England  for at present it is not only on the Coast of  Cornwall  but on every County in this Kingdom whose Land lies open to the Sea where a Ship  comes on Shore the Vessel is not only plunder'd but the Sailors too often mur∣der'd  Lady  Thus Sir it was they serv'd the Per∣son who came over with me As he strove to defend a Chest of valuable Ef∣fects which he had purchas'd Abroad he receiv'd a blow on his Head by a Club from one of the Barbarians of which Fracture he died On the Day of his Death I was brought to Bed of the Child Mr  Junior  has so generously taken Care of and with which Infant I have wander'd ever since in a most mi∣serable Condition  It is almost incredible what a Wo∣man's Pride can make her capable of either doing of suffering I don't speak Gentlemen like a Scholar by Rote 'tis only from Practice I draw my Observati∣ons but when once it becomes acquaint∣ed with Want it is sure to degenerate Haughty Minds will suffer any Afflic∣tion but Poverty at least it was so with me Necessity beggar'd me of Resolu∣tion and my Spirit was sunk like a decay'd Prop crush'd by the Building it shou'd support  CHAP XII  IT is needless I believe to observe that when a beautiful Woman re∣lates her Distresses the Audience espe∣cially if they be of the Male kind seem to sympathize in all her Sufferings Each Man pretends to Pity because he admires and admiring he hopes to do as others have doneTho' from the fair Relater he has already heard that Man's unwarrantable Pursuits oc∣casion'd every Misfortune she had en∣dured  Oh ye high and mighty Inhabitants of many Acres why will you class Beauty as a Specie of Game Destroy them accordingly and boast of it afterwards Yearly are many beautiful Innocents be∣tray'd and beggar'd yet except at the  Old Baily  seldom is Man brought to a Sense of Shame for it  NB  No Apology is made for the above Piece of MoralityIt may not be altogether thought proper for the History altho' it is very proper for the Historian Did not we circulating Li∣brary Scribes Imitators and Plagiarists  now and then thus inform the Reader we had some Morals they cou'd not easily find it out by the rest of our Writings  Yet I hope to be allow'd observing one Thing in Behalf of us Putterstogetherof things for the Amusement of the very indolent Part of the Public  That altho' our Enemies say we have neither Morals Learning Money nor MannersAs to Morals  vide  the first Part of this Chapter and our Learning is elaborately shown by our Quotations from the  Greek  Grammar the  appropos French  Phrases we have se∣lected from Dictionaire Royal and the many classical Lines which with much Trouble we have help'd ourselves to out of what is call'd  Lilly  's  Sintaxis  Thirdly as to our Manners since Mr  Hart  has taken upon him to teach grown Gentlemen to be sure we are much more polish'd than before we now and then receiving a genteel Lesson for writing a proper Advertisement  Indeed as to Money I have nothing to say to it in this ungrateful illiberal Age We Geniusses are no more minded than wornout Women of the Town nay not so much for they can turn Bawds and keep the best Company  but who the Devil can we pimp for The Muses are old Maids and Prudes and past Childbearing and we're too shabby and shamefac'd to say any thing to terrestial Toasts  What an unrewarding Aera this is The World knows we have nothing to live by but our Wits and they are re∣solv'd we shall have nothing more sub∣stantial to live upon I remember when a welltimed Pamphlet against either Party was Bread and an Attack upon the Administration a Suit of Clothes certain But there's nothing read nowadays but such a General beats the  French  there and such an Admiral takes the  French  here and this and that Island surrenders to the  English  just like the old Stories we heard at School about the  Grecians  and  Romans  conquer∣ing every body  These things are so common and  Englishmen  are so uncharitable that if we were to waste the last Drop of our Ink in the Cause of our Country in what part of our Country shou'd we be taken Care of for it Or tho' we wore our Pens to the Stumps in praise of roast Beef we shou'd never get a Bellyfull by it  For my own Part let Ignorance en∣crease I resolve against publishing any more Things I'll have my Bundle of Ma∣nuscripts buried with me and say with  Scipio  my ungrateful Country shall have none of my Remains  Yet benign Reader as I have a very capacious Family and there are several outstanding chalk Accounts in the Neigh∣bourhood against me let me beg you'll give this Work a good Word if it's only for the Sake of the old Maxim since you have been taken in to buy it Lend your Help to hum others or you may praise it upon the same humane Prin∣ciple as some Masters and Mistresses will give Servants they Discharge for male Practices a good Character Not that the Wretches deserve to be wellmentioned but what can the poor Crea∣tures do either Authors or Footmen if no body speaks for them  That you may have something to praise me for please Reader to observe the elegant Quaintness of Stile which is interspersed up and down in several pe∣culiar Phrases thro' this Compilation Many more Hints Sir have I to offer you but I believe by the Help of this digressional Appendage I have brought  this Chapter to a tolerable Length At least it will be when I have ad∣ded in order that I have the Ho∣nour to be  Friendly tho' unknown Reader your most oblig'd most obedient and most Sincere humble Servant The TRANSCRIBER  CHAPT XIII  THE Lady's Story with her man∣ner of telling it made such an Im∣pression upon Mr  Saltern  he offer'd her himself and Fortune so genteely she must have been guilty of the utmost Illmanners not to have accepted of at least one of them  Junior  had left them to themselves all that Evening being entirely taken up  with pacifying the Landlady Mrs  Belcy  Her Husband had struck her that Day an Action which as she said was horrid to think of and what he never before had ever dared to attempt but she'd be reveng'd of him by all that was Good Vow'd never more to come between a Pair of Sheets with him nor live longer in the same House And letting  Junior  see she had five hundred Pounds in Bank Bills and Cash he consented to go off with her the first Opportunity For  Jack  knew by Experience fine Women in the sporting Way are better Tools than false Dice more Money is got with them and without the Fear of Detection which sometimes cramps a finefinger'd Fellow's Dexterity  No sooner had  Aurora  no not so soonDay's Curtains had been some∣time undrawn and the rosyfinger'd La∣dyship had taken her Pinch of Snuff after Breakfast before the two Gentlemen and Lady met at the Teatable  Mr  Saltern  after making a proper Apology inform'd Mr  Junior  he wou'd postpone his intended  Welch  Tour un∣til his Return from  London  for which City he intended instantly to set out and with this Lady's Consent set her down safe there and assist her to make an  Appearance worthy her Family and Breeding begg'd Mr  Junior  wou'd meet him in Town which  Jack  promis'd without Hesitation  When every Thing was concluded off rattled the Postchaise with Messrs  Sal∣tern  and Company and at the same In∣stant into the Yard came limping a brokenknee'd Hackney whose Sides and Shoulders look'd like an illflea'd Bul∣lock upon his Back sat sideling al∣most incrustated with Dirt a tall thin Fi∣gure meagrefac'd whose whitepaper'd Curls hanging down his bloodless Cheeks made him yet look more ghastly He pitch'd his Voice in the proper Key of understrapping Authority and bawl'd about him Ostler Landlord Cook Drawer and Tapster ordering some burn'd Wine for himself warm Stables for the Horses and a Fire in the best Parlour for his Honour  Away burst the Servants hurrying here and there like a Parcel of disturb'd Ants when on a sudden they heard the Horses trampling in high Trot along the Street and dextrously turning under the Gateway up the Yard prancing ap∣pear'd a nice harness'd Set of sleekcoated chesnut Geldings rolling in their Rear a  French  varnish'd Vis a Vis out  of which nimbly skipp'd Sir  Tasty Flash  Lady Dowager  Grotto  follow'd him cau∣tiously stepping down between Land∣lord Landlady three Chambermaids two Drawers and Tapster regularly rang'd at the Door of the Carriage as a Ship's Side is mann'd for the Entrance or Exit of a great Personage  Junior  was by his Profession Company for a Man of Fashion and being inti∣mate with the Baronet no wonder they were rejoiced to see each otherSir  Tasty  had been down to take Possession of an Estate about fifty Miles farther to the West The Baronet introduc'd  Junior  to Lady  Grotto  Her Ladyship receiv'd him with a Politeness due to her Son's Recommendation declaring she shou'd be proud to have the Pleasure of cultivating an AcquaintanceThere was something in  Junior  's Figure not displeasingbut of this more hereafter or perhaps notBut we must men∣tion Sir  Tasty  fell in Love at first Sight with the Landladycou'd talk of no∣thing else all Dinnertime smoak'd the Reason of  Junior  's being theredesir'd  Jack  to take a Turn in the Garden with him and the Baronet then told him he'd give if he had her in  London  A sudden Scheme came into  Junior  's Head on hearing Sir  Tasty  's Offer But the Reader must excuse me if I don't discover it since as  Jack  did not put it in Execution it is not proper any one else should  Alass what do we gain by publishing all we know I question if even the in∣defatigable Patriot born  Ann Dom  ever clears his Advertisements  This Age is not the Age for Merit to set up his Equipage Genius is paid by the Day Bounty turn'd Electionhunter and Reward fritter'd away a∣mong ********  Yet let me for the Honour of these Times observeno let us rather ob∣serve Sir  Tasty  and  Junior  there they are close together the Baronet leaning his Elbow on a Dial playing his Bril∣liant in the Sunbeams and  Junior  with folded Arms resting himself against the Summerhouse  Sir  Tasty  Look ye  Junior  among Friends I'm fond of her she's quite the Thing I've seen something between you and her but mum You know my dear Friend I know the World you have had her I like her and he who won't part from  his Woman to his Friend has not a Drop of social Virtue about him  Junior  What makes you Sir  Tasty  imagine such a Thing is practicable  Sir  Tasty  Come come don't be queer don't hum neither did you ever know a Wo∣man that wou'dn'tthat's all Pon Honnor I'll disburse here's a Bill for Fifty bring her up to  London  I know you're an honest Fellow Hush here's our Elders  Enter Lady  Dowager  Mr  Junior  my Lady has given me his Honour he'll now and then kill an Hour this Winter with us in  London  Lady  If Mr  Junior  can find any thing there equal to his Merit  Sir  Tasty  You'll excuse me my LadyI believe we shall have more Time to say fine Things when we meet next  Will  I see is ready so Dr  Jack  Adieu as the Ghost says in  Hamlet  Farewell remem∣ber me  Junior  began now to believe there was such a Thing as being in Luck and that he was the identical Existence that For∣tune  had fix'd on for her Favourite with the Landlady Under Pretence of ta∣king an Airing he gallop'd off and after a few Days crossing the Country to avoid Pursuit they arriv'd safe in  London  of which in about a Week more he inform'd Sir  Tasty  not forgetting to enumerate the mighty Difficulties and vast Expences which attended the Un∣dertaking  Sir  Tasty  all in Rapture flew to him caress'd him in the highest Manner bid him command his Fortune vow'd an eternal Friendship to him and introdu∣ced him as his most intimate at Lady Dowager's  CHAP XIV  IN the Beginning of these Memoirs or Collection of Paragraphs the Editor promised a History of the hu∣man Mind but never declared whether it was to be a Male or Female one If he intended to describe a Lady's Incli∣nations he flattered himself  For where is the scientific Page that can lead us to unravel the whimsical Workings of a fine Woman's Fancy  Yet they themselves can account for the greatest seeming Inconsistencies of their own Sex's Behaviour as easily as we form a cometary System Nay I heard several of their Opinions upon Mrs  Belcy  the Landlady's Case who tho' she went away with Mr  Junior  as we may suppose for Love yet if she did grant Sir  Tasty  a Favour or so she was not so much to blame as People might imagine her to be This may indeed as the Lady said seem odd to some strange Mortals but they must be excessively ignorant and shockingly absurd in their Ideas to fansy a fine Wo∣man could be constant Besides as Miss  Juliet  the great Actress observed  Sir  Tasty  was a Man of Consequence and perhaps rich as  Peruvian  Mines and generous as Woman's warmest Wishes  Mr Deputy's Lady presumed that  Junior  might grow cold neglect her and not give Madam  Belcy  so much of his Time as he ought and she did it to be even with him For as Revenge is sweet this must be a very sweet Re∣vengeor perhaps Miss in her Teens sighing remarked that Sir  Tasty  might take at first some unbecoming Advan∣tage and hinted something about a Mas∣querade that terrible  Autodese  to  En∣glish  Chastities  Harry Hatzell  an Intimate of the Editor's hit off the true Reason at once saying the Landlady thought that two Friends like two Heads would be better than one that Emulation is Vi∣gour's Whetstone and a Lady who has only one Lover is as ill served as a Town with but one Tavern in it  To this Opinion the Transcriber signs for she wanted as many Friends as she could get to secure her from her Hus∣band's Resentment who presently af∣ter her Elopement broke up House∣keeping advertised her and was on his Journey to  London  to search for her  The Baronet tho' very vain had not yet talked of his Mistress either at the  Star King'sArms  or  Shakespear  whe∣ther out of Regard to Mrs  Belcy  or Fear of her Husband is undetermined He had Subtlety enough to have every Thing transacted in  Junior  's Name and every Thing was perfectly easy with  Jack  as if he had been her Husband Indeed he came Home but seldom he was eternally at my Lady Dowager's he was her Ladyship's Righthand And he also became equally necessary to Miss  Fash  who was but just recovered out of a Fit of Sickness which  Tom Fool  's Banishment had occasioned  Every Day Lady  Grotto  was obliged to pay or return Visits Mr  Junior  stayed at Home to divert Miss  Fash  at Piquet for since her last Illness Cards were ordered her by way of Alterative  Grief as Mr  Vellum  very slowly ob∣serves is twofold 'tis like Cinnabar na∣tural and factitious and Sorrow is dry Drink therefore is held by some as a wonderful Panacea in Catholic Coun∣tries a Cloister is the Specific Hang∣ing drowning and shooting are used by the good People of  England  but as they are only quack Experiments not slaying  secundem Artem  the Faculty have not ad∣mitted them into the Dispensary  Cardplaying is the best and most pro∣per Cure either for Love or Despair provided the Patients are Persons of Condition Miss  Fash  therefore applied herself incessantly to so certain an Ab∣sorbent  Junior  did not in every Party with her act consistent with the Character of a Gentleman for when he wanted Luck he made it N B This is a Sort of a Secret and like some Phrases in Free Masonry only known to the fellow Craft  By Degrees her bad Run of Cards took all her ready Money then she played upon Honour next she pledged her Jewels to him and to redeem the Diamonds she was forced to leave her Honour in his Hands  Thus we read of infatuated Victims making Compacts with the Prince of  Pandemonium  his sulphureous Majesty and because he should allow them to ap∣pear in Splendor at present give up to him for always the only precious Thing or Part belonging to them  O ye much reasoning  Literati  Why will ye not do something more than just tell us like Guideposts the Way we have to goWhy will ye not budge  yourselves Do but once ye Dispas∣sionates hold in a dozen Hands at Ha∣zard take off your own Toast in a pint Bumper or feel yourselves embra∣ced in the dark Hour of Assignation then ye would judge more like Men and Women of the World and not expect we can become pure Philosophers on this Side Fifty  By the Vigilance of Miss  Fash  's Ma∣ma this Commerce was discovered Lady  Grotto  surprizing  Junior  and her Daughter in what she called unlawful Trafficking but she resolved to prevent the Affair from being blown therefore took the Gentleman to herself and or∣dered Miss to prepare for her Marriage with Lord  Pillow  His Lordship was very polite exces∣sively goodnatured vastly complaisant and inestimably well bred if any Thing rather too easy Seldom speaking in Company not but he was allowed to have a deal of Sense only he had been often told nothing could be worse than to affect Wit Neither was he very curious because Enquiries would have sometimes led him into Societies below his Birth and a Man of Fashion should never have any Thing to say to the Vul∣gar He was never guilty of any illmannered  Contradictions but entirely regulated by the Advice of his Friends Relations and Domestics What they told him to be Taste he believed to be so Was it either to build or pull down to clump or inclose to subscribe to furnish to bet to influence Elec∣tions to buy Pictures breed running Horses or address a Lady  In Pursuance therefore of their Coun∣cils he paid his Attendance to Lady Dowager's Daughter and Miss  Fash  not caring to disoblige her Mama and as Necessity not Affection had occa∣sioned the Intrigue between her and  Ju∣nior  she gave his Lordship her Hand The Wedding was solemnized with all imaginable Magnificence  CHAP XV  A Return to  Fool Hall  ONCE more my good Reader well met at the Squire's You see the Company are drinking Tea in the Saloon we won't disturb them they'll have done presently Here's a fine green painted  Chinese  Backbenchex∣cuse my Boldness but pray be seated and permit me to ask you two or three Questions  Pray Sir how do you like this Hi∣story  Reader  So so  Author  Why sosobe it then A deal of Pains has been bestowed upon it  Reader  Very likely But pray to what Pur∣pose Would not your Industry have answered much better had you em∣ployed it to improve yourself in that Bu∣siness whatever it was to which your Pa∣rents bred you  Author  That it what I would have done O most friendly Monitor has I been  brought up to any We would no more scribble than poor Strumpets would strole the Streets had we any Thing else to do  Have you not seen Children raise Dams to stop a Kennel's filthy Current Have you not also observed some grown Persons cut Tables Dressers and Sticks to PiecesAlas Boys making mud Walls Men whittling Wood and our patching up Pamphlets are all from the same Principle a simple Inclination to do something  But as it is customary for Sculptors to chizzle their Names Architects to make their Marks and Painters to portrait their own Faces so is it proper Authors in some Parts of their Works should give an Account of themselves least like  Homer  our Patron and Preceptor after our Deaths seven or eight Parishes may go to Law or Loggerheads about paying our burial Dues  To begin then with my own Account  My Fatheralas I had a Father but Lady  Fool  's Visitants are up ready to promenade round the Garden I'll postpone my own History and go on with their'sThis Way gentle Rea∣der along that evergreen Hedgerow  cross 'twixt those Tulipbeds and we shall meet them in the Musictemple  Mr  Fool  and  Junior  are earnest in Ar∣gument  Junior  is lamenting the Insince∣rity of Mankind the Depravity of Taste Decay of Trade Encrease of Taxes Abuse of Power and all the other trite Topics with which this Nation is now and then Pamphletbubbled  Mr Fool  Excuse me Mr  Junior  but there are Valetudinarians in the Body politic as well as the Body muscular and when the Breath of Rumour blows it puts them out of Heart and they believe the Nation's Constitution to be immediately incurable  Then there are always too many ano∣nymous Writers who like Quacks must starve for Want of Business had every Individual Understanding enough not to be imposed upon by their For∣geries but they with specious Pretence of public Utility like a Toad under Sage spread their Poison unsuspected  When Ladies and Gentlemen are up∣on a Visit together in this Kingdom the Conversation is divided as it was at Mr  Fool  's For while  Junior  and the Squire were deeply engaged in the Busi∣ness of the Nation the Ladies were as  earnest in expatiating upon Trolly Gar∣net Trimmings  Dresden  Figures Ser∣vants Carelessness and  French  Varnish  Lady  Pillow  endeavoured to ingratiate herself with Lady  Fool  and she succeed∣ed to Admiration The City Lady was charmed to hear the late Miss  Fash  re∣peat the Particularities of  James  's Parish and then such elegant Notions as Lady  Grotto  had about fancying Furniture and Notableness in domestic Management They were prevailed upon by Lady  Fool  to stay a Month at  Foolhall  and  Junior  was included in the Party  One Morning after all this good Company had been there about a Week Lady  Pillow  left her lonely uneasy Bed much sooner than is customary with the Delicate her Mind was horribly di∣sturbed she fancied a Walk in the Gar∣den would be of Service There she happened to meet  Junior  who like her had rose for the Benefit of Contempla∣tion  Her Ladyship as they met declared she must needs speak with him imme∣ciately They came close to a many pil∣lar'd Building generally called the  Pan∣theum  they ascended the Steps she threw herself into a Cushioncovered Windowseat and after three or four  Sighs which gave her animal Spirits sufficient Relief she was enabled to de∣liver intelligibly the following Words  Lady Pillow  Mr  Junior  I find that when a Lady has made one false Step she's liable to trip all her Life afterYou know the Obligations you have to me I know the Connections 'twixt you and MamaI must have Mr  Fool  Junior  My Lady  Lady Pillow  I don't care what becomes of all the Worldhear me out He can't love this City Creature he has married Gra∣titude indeed He has a grateful Spirit to all the World but meHe behaves to her like an AngelShe loves him but indeed what Lady would not Oh Mr  Junior  help meMr  Fool  shuns mebe but my Friend in this all past Actions shall be forgiven if not by Heavens tho' I myself sink in the Discovery all shall be known  Junior  Will your Ladyship permit me to hear how I may assist you  Lady Pillow  You must commence an Intrigue with Lady  Fool  Junior  What Madam when she loves her Husband  Lady Pillow  Your Sex are not always thus diffident of succeeding with oursbut that's no MatterShe has not Sense enough to lovenoI'll assist you and let a Wo∣man alone to win a WomanI know her FoibleShe drinks Mr  Junior  Nay you must have perceived her since we have visited here to have been some∣times on the wrongside Reason Leave me to prepare the Way and be you ready to improve the Opportunity  Junior  vowed an implicit Obedience and both well pleased returned into the Breakfast Parlour  There is a famous pantomimical En∣tertainment called the Contention be∣tween Reason and Will but tho' it is hourly performed by Mankind's Com∣pany of Comedians yet the Players are not so perfect in their Parts as they ought to be the Study being so very difficult  Now on what is called the Theatre Actors and Actresses may keep up their Consequences just as they please since they appear not in inferior Casts but only now and then like Eastern Mo∣narchs  with all the Pride Pomp and Circumstance of pageant Finery  But we on Life's real and various Stages cannot preserve the consequen∣tial Part of our Character because as we are obliged every Day to make some Part of an Appearance it necessarily follows that we must sometimes act out of Character  Thus the once amiable Miss  Fash  be∣came deceitful and the careful Lady  Greensay  is metamorphosed into a Dram∣drinker once or twice in a Century such Things will happen In her Hus∣band the Baronet's Time Lady  Fool  used to take a Cordial for Lowness of Spirits and since  French  Liquaeum became tiptop Taste she grew fashionably fond of them and indeed looked sometimes as if she had but a confused Notion of Things  We don't say tho' her Chaplain Mr Rector did that the Day she would go out to look out for  Tom Fool  her Lady∣ship had been sipping  CHAP XVI  AN Opportunity soon offered which Lady  Pillow  did not neglect The two Ladies had been one Afternoon  Tete a Tete  conversing together for two or three Hours when a Walk to the  Indian  Pavillion at the Bottom of the Garden was proposed by Lady  Grotto  's Daughter  Arm in Arm they tripped along by Chance  Junior  was there just when they were seated Lady  Pillow  started up she had lost one of her brilliant Drops beg∣ged to be excused and hurried out to hunt for it  Now came on the fatal Time for Lady  Fool  Always it is said against the Death of noble Personages the Uni∣verse is unshipped Creation's Anatomy dislocated and the Wheels of the World put out of Order Monstrous Births Multiplication of Suns Showers of red Ink dismal aerial Yells and JackoLanthorn Dances are seen heard and wondered at  Antient authentic History abounds with Omens and modern Memorialists  throw in a Prodigy now and then just to grace their Annals with decent Horror  For as Mr  Lee  says when a great Man falls i e one who has sacrificed about two Millions of Mankind just to make himself a great Man yet at his Death Creation feels a Loss and Dame Nature like a distracted Parent tears herself to Pieces  Is it then to be doubted that at the Death of Lady  Fool  's Honour the fol∣lowing Portents were forthcoming  Cross the silvery shining Moon a broad black Cloud spread like a mourn∣ing Veil as it were in Sorrow for the Lady's Loss Behind the Alcove a Bittern with Bill ingulphed deep in the reedy Ditch sounded hoarse the whoop∣ing Own forsook its Ivytangled Cell flittering Bats fled forth blinking Bee∣tles doleful hummed their nightly drone∣ing Peal the Housedog howled dread∣ful croaking Toads crawled cross the smoothmown Mead a noisome Fog spread its unwholesome Vapour growl∣ing Thunder rumbled overhead the rustling Wind whistled hollow thro' the Rafters of an unroofed Barn and a fast falling Shower rattling pattered against the Sashes  But in the very Honeymoon of this Intriguenay before even Lady  Pillow  could reap any Advantage by it it was destroyed Lady Dowager too well experienced not to take Notice of the slightest Neglect discovered that Lady  Fool  had clandestinely possessed her∣self of Lady  Grotto  's Property in Mr  Junior  this the Dowager took Care to inform Mr  Fool  of nay brought him to be Evewitness of his own Dis∣grace unperceived either by his Lady or her Paramour  Tom Fool  burst into the Room and in the Heart of Passion demanded Satisfac∣tion told  Junior  he should wait for him by the old Chapel and mounted his Horse immediately  Jack Junior  had a proper Quantity of fashionable Spirit which empowered him to back a bad Action with a worse in a few Minutes followed him out of the Room where he was met on the Landingplace by Lady  Grotto  who up∣braided him with Ingratitude for his wronging his Host As for my Part continued my Lady your taking up with such a Person after I have been weak enough to let you have any Thing to say to me does not in the least pique menot in the least I assure you Mr  Junior  it only shews me what your Sex are that's all but I congratulate your Taste to be sure Sir  Junior  replied to her somewhat penitentially and there would have been it is believed a Co∣alition of Parties presently and in∣deed it was what her Ladyship expected had not  Junior  recollected that his Ho∣nour lay at Stake therefore he left her abruptly went down to the Stables enquired which Way Mr  Fool  went and hearing the Squire had Pistols with him  Junior  borrowed a Pair from the Steward and set forward after the much injured Mr  Fool  Lady  Fool  whom Surprize had stu∣pefied sat for four or five Minutes after the Antagonists had left the Room like  Niobe  just petrified or to make a more credible Simily as when in the large Mansion waiting the Family's Return a solasitting Housewife pores over the melancholy Page of  Glan∣ville  's Witches the History of  Hobgob∣lins  or some other such Daemonraising Work as she reads on her Blood more chilly circulates an anguish Tremor agitates her Muscles if then the Wind chances to blow ope her Doors she seems fixed as if froze speechless all  her Powers cease from Motion even her Life indicating Eye alters not its Point  Thus frighten'd and frightful wildly staring sat Lady  Fool  upon the Bedside and as soon as she came to herself she rung the Bell with the utmost Vehe∣mence  Susan  enter'd on the Instant with a Bottle of Citron Water in her Hand judging that was what her Lady∣ship was in such a Hurry for The Mo∣ment the Maid enter'd her Ladyship wringing her Hands cry'd out oh  Susan  what will become of me I'm ruin'd  Susan  I'm ruin'd what shall I do  Susan  The Lord forbid Madam but pray my Lady how  Lady  O  Susan  here happen'd to be Mr  Junior  in my Room I don't know how he came in but I was taken with a Swimming in my Head and he was lift∣ing me from my Bed just as my Spouse open'd the Door And to be sure Mr  Fool  flew into such a jealous Passion I don't know what may be the Conse∣quence if he shou'd speak of it  Susan  I'm ruin'd  Crying  My Reputation my dear Reputation's gone for ever  Susan  Dear my Lady  Maid Crying  don't  weep I'm sure you'll break my Heart to see as how your Ladyship grieves yourselfTo be sure my Lady my Master his Honour has too much Sense  Lady  O  Susan  my Reputation I shall never  Susan  Do pray my Lady sip up this Spoon∣ful just to recover yourself To be sure my Lady Reputation's very well among poor Folks and we Servants when out of Place but you are a rich Lady and a fine Lady and great Ladies shou'd always be above minding Trifles There's my Lady  Grotto  why now she wou'dn't take on so and yet Mr  Junior  and she are greater than they shou'd be that I know  Lady  How  Susan  are you sure of that  Susan  Yes my Lady I'll take my corporal Oath on'tI saw something Yesterday between them made my Flesh creep upon my BonesTo be sure Servants shou'd hear see and say Nothing so I resolv'd to do only thought it was my Duty to tell your Ladyship  Lady  The Wickedness of this Age My  good God Cou'd I ever think Lady  Grotto  wou'd have done soWhat bring Fellows for her filthy Intrigues into my House if she had a Mind to play the Strumpet cou'dn't she do it at Home  Susan  Indeed my Lady I never lik'd that laced Coat Fellur Muster  Junior  and if as his Honour my Master shou'd come to any Harm by him  Lady  O  Susan  don't name itI shou'd never outlive ithe's the best of Hus∣bands Oh if my Lady  Grotto  's Fellow shou'd kill him  Susan  Dear my Lady shall I go and see for his Honour Pray my Lady don't cry do pray take this Tea Cupfull there my Lady I'm sure 'twill do your Ladyship goodCrying spoils the Eyes and such fine Eyes too as your Ladyship has For all the Gentle∣men that come to our House say Mrs  Susan  your Lady has lovely Eyes  Lady  Lord how the Wench runs on  Susan  Indeed my Lady Grief bringson Wrin∣kles  the most fastest of any thing in the whole World and such pure White and Red too as your Ladyship has and all natural tooand that's more nor my Lady  Grotto  can say for all she looks so Cherrycheek'd  Lady  Oh don't mention her  Susan  but go for Mr Rector bring him to me im∣mediately  Susan  Pray my Lady don't cry again I'll go fetch the Parsonpray my Lady be compos'dI'll leave the Bottle with your Ladyship  Exit  Susan  Now her Ladyship is left alone her Eyes fast fix'd on the Bottle like an Infant looking upon a Map Her Spi∣rits were frustrated she wou'd have re∣flected about herself Mr  Fool  Lady  Grotto  and  Junior  but a sudden Pain shot cross her Stomachshe was ob∣lig'd to have Recourse to her Cordial Her Imagination began to be abomina∣bly hurry'd Crouds of complex'd Ideas disturb'd her faltering disjointed Sylla∣bles fell from her Lips inverted Shapes danc'd before her Sight along the Bed she sidelong sunk then heavy Sleep  Seiz'd on each dizzy Sense and closed her coquer'd Eyes  As  Susan  left her Lady's Room the Maid was met by Lady  Pillow  to whom the communicative Mrs  Susan  related all Lady  Fool  's Distresses in∣forming the astonish'd young Lady that whereby his Honour her Master had found that Fellur  Junior  along with my Lady somehow the Squire took it ill and so they went out in a Huff toge∣ther and God forbid there comes no Harm on'tTo be sure as I told her Ladyship Servants shou'dn't say much but I think my Lady is but in a Dispa∣ration way herself or else she wou'd never have sent me for our Chaplain to say his Prayers by herand away Mrs  Susan  hasten'd down the Stairs leaving Lady  Pillow  to recover herself by De∣grees And indeed we must do the same to attend upon the Combatants  Tom Fool  rode out determin'd upon Revenge and  Junior  as determin'd fol∣low'd him Mr  Fool  hurry'd away by his Passion spurr'd his Horse on whipp'd leap'd and gallop'd Persons who are very uneasy do not chuse to suffer any thing to be at rest they have Power overThe Place of Appointment was  about three Miles off He soon arrived at it and while he was there amused his Expectation by raising himself every now and then in his Stirrups to look after his Adversary  On the moral Rectitude of Duelling the Reader may consult  Jacob Behmen  we have now no Time to do it being oblig'd as well as the Squire to enquire after  Junior  who to do him Justice rode out with a Resolution to give Mr  Fool  Gentlemanlike Satisfaction For Gamblers like Women of the Town must have something of the People of Fashion about them or they can never expect to be introduc'd into Companies where they may make their Market Now as no Man can be a Man of Ho∣nour that won't meet his Man  ergo  every Man is a Man of Honour that will and for that sole Accomplishment qualified to keep the best Company  CHAP XVII  TO speak is something so selfpleasing that we are apt to talk until we forget what we had to say Thus it has happen'd to the Memorialist whose Digression almost drove the Hi∣story out of his Head or else he wou'd in the last Chapter have inform'd the Reader that after  Junior  had got out of the Parkgate mistaking the Servants Directions he turn'd to the Left in∣stead of the Right and at a Distance perceiving something upon a Hill which he imagin'd to be the old Chapel Mr  Fool  mention'd he gallop'd up to it forthwith  As he mounted the Hill he observ'd it to be a large old stonebuilt Barn and rode up in Hopes of meeting some Per∣son to enquire his Way ofHe found a young Woman sitting at the Door of whom he ask'd his Road but the in∣form'd him she was a Stranger travelling towards  London  and begg'd he wou'd bestow something upon her Some Per∣sons when they are ask'd for Charity will give their Blessing but no Money others are more ready to part with their  Persons than their Cash  Junior  was at this Time in a loving Disposition The Girl look'd wanton and wholesome and they went in to the Barn together hanging his Horse at the Door as his Girl desir'd him  That was what his very yielding Mi∣stress wish'd for She knew that behind the Barn her Man had hid himself and was ready as soon as the fond Couple had retired to mount the Gentleman's Horse and gallop off with it accord∣ing to the Plan they had contriv'd as they saw  Junior  mounting the Hill Her Fellow had but just been clear'd at  York  Sizes for want of Evidence and they were tramping it to  London  when  Ju∣nior  's Appearance gave them a Hint to put in Practice the Scheme beforemen∣tion'd It was executed with all imagin∣able Success and  Jack  oblig'd to walk in his Boots above half a dozen Miles before he cou'd find an Inn to put up at from whence he sent a Letter to Lady  Pillow  to enquire how every Thing was at the Hall  All was Distraction there Mr  Fool  had so endear'd himself to every Ser∣vant by his Behaviour that the whole House was in an Uproar when it came to be known he went out with Pistols to  fight  Junior  The Men went of their own Accord several Ways to seek their Master But before this Mrs  Susan  had reach'd the Parsonage where she found Mr  Rector  deeply immers'd in electrical Experiments endeavouring to discover an universal Nostrum  For the Vicar after the loss of Lady  Fool  had given himself up entirely to the Study of the sublime Sciences saying like some other odd Philosophers Women were unworthy a wise Man's Notice As soon as Mrs  Susan  saw him she cry'd Lord Mr  Rector  you must come to my Lady immediately she's all out of Sorts  Mr  Rector  If her Ladyship is out of Sorts she must be electrifiedthat attenuates that stimulates  Mrs  Susan  It may be so Sir but our whole House is out of Sorts  Mr  Rector  Then the whole House must be elec∣trified as we fumigate against any epi∣demical Disease or as Catholics in their Exorcisms sprinkle with holy Water  Mrs  Susan  I'm sure Water won't do her Ladyship any good its too cold for herSo Mr  Parson you must come and talk about your Learning to her for she is but in a so and so Way I can tell you  Mr  Rector  Is she notbut I assure you Mrs  Susan  I can restore herI have a Spe∣cific there it is  pointing to the Ma∣chine  with this I will do such Things that were the great  Boyle  alive he wou'd say to me  Tu eris mihi magnus Apollo  Mrs  Susan  But you mustn't follow you must go along with me and I'll tell you what Doctor bring that Thing Umbob with youit's like a Show it may make my Lady laugh mayhapMr  Rector  not caring to trouble himself with explaining any thing to  Susan  only thought fit silently to despise her for her Ignorance and order'd his electrical Ap∣paratus to be brought after him to Lady  Fool  's As Mrs  Susan  and the Vicar cross'd the Closes the Maid let him in∣to some Part of the History relating to Mr  Fool  and  Junior  's going out together to fight  When the Vicar with Mrs  Susan  en∣ter'd her Ladyship's Apartment Lady  Fool  was dozingher Woman too hastily waking her made her Ladyship start up affrighted and her Eyes opening upon  Mr  Rector  's uncouth Appearance added to her Terror Altho' he was a Clergy∣man he had then nothing black about him but his Face and Hands they were crusted over by the Smoke of his Expe∣riments and Dust of his Study a true philosophic Bronze venerable as the Rust upon MedalsHe was a Man of too refin'd Notions to mind Externals Superior to Form and so much absorb'd in sublime Speculations cou'd not con∣sult Dress tho' he was to wait upon a LadyMust Man Prerogative pos∣sessing Man classically and contempla∣tively dignified must he descend to think to act or wear Clothes like eve∣ryday appearing MortalsNo thus Mr  Rector  answer'd Mrs  Susan  who found Fault with his having a coarse Flannel Nightcap on his Head over which Turbanlike a dirty Neckcloth was tied and a muchworn red Bays Banyan cover'd the rest of this Figure  Lady  Fool  struck with the Sight holding up her outspread Hands trem∣bling utter'dMy God What's that Jesus I hope you don't come to rob me A more cool Imagination than her Ladyship's might have been mistaken in the Gentleman's Profession But con∣vinc'd by Mrs  Susan  of her Mistake  the Lady ask'd his Pardon and burst∣ing into Tearswithoh Mr  Rector  I'm frighten'd out of my Wits  Rector  I opined indeed your Ladyship's Un∣derstanding was insane from the Incon∣gruity of Apprehension you just now was guilty ofbut  nemo Mortalium    Lady  Dear Mr  Rector  don't talk of Mor∣tality now I have been dreaming of Death's Heads and Plumes of Feathers  Rector  Give me Leave a Moment my Lady to consult with myself upon your Case and immediately he threw himself into a meditating Attitude He was like most of his booklearn'd Brethren of an un∣forgiving contemptuous Spirit She had taken him for a Felonthat he cou'd not pass overbut resolv'd to let it rest for a while especially as he concluded her to be delirious therefore he deter∣min'd to sooth her by soft Persuasion until his experimental Engine came then he design'd to cure her by Electri∣fication and publish her Case with all the concurrent Circumstances and thus at once gratify the two most indulg'd the meanest of all the Passions Vanity and Revenge Setting one Hand by his  Side and extending the other he made with it a Sweep from his Nose to his Knees at the same Time pawing forth his right Leg and Foot nodded his Head his Bow finished he stood erect again cough'd hemm'd and thus ora∣torized  St  Austin Seneca Cardan Boetius Plato  and  Epictetus  have discriminately my Lady elucidated to us the Preven∣tion of Grief and what  Tertullian  tells us upon that Head is worthy Observa∣tion Grief is in itself as St  Chrysostom  says an Antithesis to Joy therefore the Poets have defined Sorrow to be joyless or abstracted from Mirth Hence by the Constriction as well as Construction of the glandulous Valves stimulated by the Diaphragma's Suspiration the animal Spirits are jaculated into the la∣chrymal Ducts which occasions Tears  Lady  No Mr  Rector  it is Fear for my dear Husband's fighting a Duel occa∣sions my Tears  Rector  Pity it is that Duelling should be the Men of Mode's Nostrum when Electri∣fying is so much a safer Panacea I am my Lady conscious of as much innate Bravery as it is possible for any Man to  possess but must I put my Life upon the impelled Velocity of a Bullet Or suffer my Heart to be a horizontal Mark for the acute Point of a Rapier to per∣forate  Lady  Oh Mr  Rector  how can you talk about killing when that dear Creature my Husband may a be murdering this Moment  Rector  Madam if his Honour should be de∣stroyed I shall be as much concerned for him as a Philosopher ought to be the Man who kills him must be hanged and your Ladyship must be electrified  Word was brought him that his elec∣trifying Apparatus was come he bid it be brought up Stairs and began to set it in order Her Ladyship who had ne∣ver seen any of that Sort before stared and asked him if he was going to con∣jure but before he could answer her  Susan  bounced into the Room over the Machine she tumbled crash the glass Globe fell to the Ground poor  Susan  rowling about among the Pieces sprawl∣ing kicking and shrieking but up she soon scrambled and ran at Mr  Rector  openfisted crying Curse your Rattling Trapsshe scratched she tore she bit  him he calling out piteously all the while and at the same Time my Lady bawling herself black in the Face with bidding  Susan  leave off but nothing could stop her Rage but an Inability of Breath As soon as she was out of Wind the suffering Vicar arose baldpated his Band torn his Nose bit in two Places and his Face and Breast covered with Blood that came from  Susan  's cut Fin∣gers which she had mangled among the Bits of broken Glass  My Lady could not bear to look up∣on Mr  Rector  but begged he would go immediately to the Surgeon's for she vowed he looked horridly shocking and vastly frightful The Chaplain at that Moment casting his Eyes upon the Look∣ingGlass gave a great Groan and ran down Stairs crying out a Doctor a Doctor for God's Sake Oh I shall bleed to Death Consider what the Loss of me will be mine is no common Loss the World will miss me O that I had but published my Electrics then I should have existed to Afterages with  Bacon Newton  and the rest of my bro∣ther Geniusses like me  Britons  like me Philosophers but ah unlike me in FortuneWhat must I die ignoted Die soAy sothat's itDie  scratched to DeathWhat a Death for a ScholarI feel the Venom of her Nails now in my Nose the Poison ascends to the Olfactories the Cellulae of my Brain will be loaded and I shall be distracted yet bear Witness Neigh∣bours I won't forgive herMore he would have said had not a Surgeon been luckily at the Hall under whose Care we shall leave the Vicar and wait upon her Ladyship who was curious as the Reader may be to know the Reason of  Susan  's abrupt Entrance  We have already taken Notice of the Confusion all the Family was in at Mr  Fool  's being missing and that the Ser∣vants went several Ways to seek him Now the Stewards happened to be at the very Inn where  Junior  came to  The faithful Domestic had him seized and carried him before a Justice for murdering Mr  Fool  and as he could not give a very satisfactory Account about his Horse nor himself he was committed to PrisonThis was the News  Susan  brought in such a Hurry which occa∣sioned the electrical Catastrophe above mentioned It may be wondered at by some Readers that Lady  Grotto  came not at this Time to comfort Lady  Fool  but the Dowager was all this Time em∣ployed much more agreeably at least as she thought being taken up with writing Letters to every one of her Ac∣quaintance round the Country in which the History of Lady  Fool  's Infidelity and Disgrace was painted in a very plain and very particular Manner  Not so satisfactory was her Daughter Lady  Pillow  amused The young La∣dy after recovering herself from what  Susan  had related was a sorrowful Wit∣ness what Trouble Mr  Fool  's Absence occasioned and retired to her Cham∣ber attended by that terrible Tormen∣tor SelfAccusation  After some Moments Pause thus the unfortunate Lady began  Yes I am the wicked Author of all thisHe'll murder that charming Fel∣low Shoot him thro' the Back  The Villain that was base enough to take such an Advantage of me will ne∣ver give a Man fair Play  Junior  is an Assassin Oh my dear  Tom Fool  that I could but be by in any Shape to assist theeThe Arrival of her Spouse Lord  Pillow  who had been about a Month upon the Mountain's Moor shooting put an End to her Soliloquy With her Mama she attended his Lordship to  Tea Lady  Fool  sent her Excuse being immensely out of Order and not fit to see Company  That Lord  Pillow  might not remain a Stranger to Lady  Fool  's Illness Lady Dowager told his Lordship that an odd Accident happened here you know  Junior  my Lord my Son's great Fa∣vourite  Lord Pillow  Intimately my Lady and I assure you he has very much of the Man of Fashion about him  Lady Grotto  He has been one of our Party here I can't say it was any Desire of mine it should be so for pon my Onner the Man is a disagreeable to me as a Hackney Coach however Lady  Fool  is Mistress of her own House you know and she insisted on it I thought it was a little odd whimsical and so forth but as I detest Scandal I hate to be in∣quisitive however Love and Murder as they say will out The Affair's over and I am sorry to say her Ladyship's blown for young  Fool  her Spouse who was my Son's under Gamekeeper caught her and  Junior  in Bed together this Morn∣ing I am sorry to break off all Ac∣qaintance with her Ladyship so instan∣taneously  but it cannot be avoided for how can I Lord  Pillow  ever look up∣on Lady  Fool  with friendly Face again after she has so grossly forfeited her Honour  Lord Pillow  You are perfectly in the Right in∣deed Lady  Grotto  But where is  Junior  Lady Pillow  Mr  Fool  challenged him upon the Spot and they are afraid  Junior  is gone after to fight him  Lord Pillow  By all Means or I would never have spoke to  Junior  henceforward nor would Sir  Tasty  I assure you  Lady Pillow  My Dear dear Lord how can you talk so Suppose now a Thief  Lord Pillow  No my Dear you must pardon me there a Robbery is one Thing and an Affair of this Kind is another With a Thief you consider Loss of Property or some other mercantile View but with Respect to a Challenge you are not to consider any Thing  Lady Pillow  No  Lord Pillow  Nopositively no except the Chal∣lenge itself that like a Playdebt must be paid upon Honour  Lady Dowager  However I insist upon going away Tomorrow You Lordship to be sure has a right Idea what belongs to your Sex's Honour and I never yet I hope was deficient in what regarded me or mine Therefore I beg your Lordship will make it a Point that we may go off in the Morning for I cannot sleep with any Tranquility in a House the Mistress of which has so lately polluted it with Adultery  Here we would say something about Lady  Pillow  's Sentiments upon this Af∣fair were we not this Instant interrupt∣ed by the Vicar who sending in his Duty to the Right Honourable It was immediately granted and Mr  Rector  entered his Band changed Face and Hands wash'd Nose plaistered and Chin fresh shaved in his best Suit of Cano∣nicals with a fine flowing flaxen full∣curl'd Perriwig crown'd with a high Foretop and fullpowder'd  With a becoming Reverence he made a roundabout Obeisance then with  humble Submission began a Petition to their Ladyships addressing them with beseeching their Graciousnesses that they would out of the Benevolence of their Dispositions condescend to beam forth a Look of Compassion on that poor lost Sinner Lady  Fool  who was now in vi∣olent Hysterics  The Ladies immediately went to see her and his Lordship ordering the Chaplain to be seated entertained the attentive Mr  Rector  for the rest of the Evening with his dextrous Exploits up∣on Heathcocks and Country Wenches  CHAP XVIII  IT is now Time to inform those who have determined to read these Vo∣lumes through that after Mr  Fool  had waited some Hours at the Place appoint∣ed in vain he began to consider what could be the Reason of  Junior  's Ab∣sence Certain I am thus Mr  Fool  so∣liloquized he could not mistake the Place if he had a Mind to have met me he might have been here before now Perhaps Shame prevents him it must be soShall I search for him NoHome I am determined not to return and upon these Words spur∣ring on his Horse he gallopped across the Country  After he had hurried along about thirty Miles he found Night overtake him very fast as he entered upon a large Moor he was quite ignorant of the Country and as it grew dark  Tom Fool  laid the Reins loose upon his Horse's Neck and suffered the Beast to go which Way he pleased The Horse kept with∣out Food for the whole Day was seek∣ing something to eat when his fore Feet broke down the Earth and he  fell with his Rider into a deep Pit from whence Stones and Slates formerly were dug The Beast died upon the Spot and Mr  Fool  with much Difficulty dis∣engaging himself from the Carcase too much bruised to get up without Help was forced to remain below till Morn∣ing when he was found and relieved by the greatest Accident imaginable  One of the many elegant and inno∣cent Amusements which young Ladies of Fashion kill Part of their Morning Time with is collecting and arranging curious Shells and uncommon Pebbles  To obey a Lady's Orders the Morn∣ing after Mr  Fool  's Fall Mr  Borlace  had taken a Walk to the Quarry Peb∣blehunting there he found  Tom Fool  and had him conveyed to a Farmhouse the only Dwelling for many Miles round  This Mansion stood in the midst of a large uncultivated Common which was overspread with Furze Thistles Fern Rushes and Turf Pools for want of being properly enclosed For as it as divided into several Lordships the Per∣sons possessed of its different Manors were not unanimous about draining diking and improving it  Sir  Selzy Simkrimp  would not come in∣to it because as he told his Spouse  while he pointed his Finger over the Land Surveyor's Plan only mind me my Dear if I consent to this Affair Widow  Wail  comes in for four Acres and two Perch more than I have  His Curate took the Liberty to hint that inclosing would be a Means of em∣ploying a Number of Poor whose Fa∣milies were now starving that Charity was of heavenly Birth that he hoped the Great the Rich and Powerful would now and then condescend to think that the poorest Creatures are their fellow Creatures made of the same Materials quickened by the same Spirit and sup∣ported by the same Elements Then Sympathy nay even base SelfLove would dole out some Superfluities to feed the Hungry to cloath the Naked  Let's have none of your Nonsense in∣terrupted the Baronet as to Poor we have too many already and damn'd high Assessments and if these Wretches can get Children now they are half starv'd What would they do if they had their Bellies full I say they that stand up for the Poor only encourage Poachers and our Game is thin enough already so I'll not give my Vote for it  And if I do I'll be damn'd replied Squire  Bitt  it would destroy all my Co∣ver for Hares  From this modern Way of Reasoning but one Consequence could be supposed it was totally neglected except some Acres round the House to which Mr  Fool  had been carried  The Tenant of which Habitation in her Youth had been a celebrated Lady of Pleasure and dealt formerly with most of the Gentlemen belonging to that County  When she according to the common Custom of her Profession fell to De∣cay the neighbouring Gentlemen out of Gratitude as they will sometimes maintain worn out Hunters fitted up Part of an old Hall stock'd some Ground round it and gave it to her for Life It was to this House  Tom Fool  was carried  About the same Time that Morning Lady  Grotto  with Lord and Lady  Pil∣low  took their Leaves of Lady  Fool  her Ladyship immediately after retiring to her Chamber overwhelmed with Af∣fliction  Herehereseems to be a Stagna∣tion of the Story or the Business of the Story for the Editor like a savageminded  Tragedy Writer has maimed or made away with most of his  Dra∣matis Personae  except Mr  Junior  no we have him left to keep Attention a∣wake like a Dance between the Acts for something must be done  English  People love to be busy themselves or see others so Therefore as this will be the last Time we shall have any Occasion to mention Mr  Senior  's Son and that his Narration shall no more interrupt the Thread of our Chronicle we shall like a judicious Historian al∣tho' it is a little out of the Order of Time put all that is to come to Hand of him in the following Paragraphs which we would immediately lay before the Reader but beg Leave to refer him to the next Chapter  CHAP XIX  The Conclusion of the Adventures of  JUNIOR  AT first he made slight of being seiz'd but Lady  Fool  to clear her Reputation dispatch'd a Messenger to the Justice with a Letter in which she insisted on it the Villain shou'd be made an Example of for he had murder'd the best of Husbands  Lady  Grotto  gave up  Junior  entirely she despised him for the Absurdity of his Taste to neglect her for a City Lady and indeed wish'd he might be punish'd for his immense Illmanners in so ab∣ruptly leaving her at the last Interview Lady  Pillow  look'd on him as an Assas∣sin and Sir  Tasty  declared pon onner he cou'd have nothing to say to Mr  Ju∣nior  till he had clear'd up his Character  On his second Examination several very creditable Persons deposed that he always appeared to be very much of the Gentleman he always laid his Money very fair paid his play Debts punctu∣ally no Person wore better Cloaths or gave more Money to Servants on a Visit  but it is much more necessary for a Man at some Times to be really a Gentle∣man than only to look like one in the Eye of the Law all those hi fine Ac∣complishments were invalid Mr  Fool  was not yet found an Order came for him in Consequence of Lady  Fool  's Letter to be more closely confin'd  One Misfortune seldom comes alone for  Junior  found on his Return to Prison an Action lodg'd against him by the Innkeeper for criminal Conversation  Finding himself press'd by the Law and deserted by his Friends he thought that Things were almost over with him however he was resolv'd not to fling up his Cards while there seem'd to be a Probability of recovering the Game therefore began to scheme accordingly  Hunger will break through Stone Walls and Money he knew to have that hungry Quality The next Evening as the Goaler and he sat Tete a Tete over a large Bowl of Punch he after a little Circumlocution proffer'd the Prisonkeeper fifty Guineas nay pull'd the Sum out to shew it him to let him make his Escape  The Goaler reply'd he cou'd not say any thing to it  Junior  turn'd off the Discourse in an Instant as he knew his  Man and chose as  Othello  says  He shou'd chew upon it  pretended to be sleepy and went early to Bed  When the Lockerup had turn'd into his own Bed he cou'd not close his Eyes the Guineas seem'd still before them He began to grow very restless tumbling and tossing and turning His Spouse whom he had not for some Years before that Night disturb'd by his Overwakefulness was scared at the Oddness of the Thing cou'd not imagine what it was She a while lay still ex∣pecting what wou'd come on't but find∣ing him still continue insignificantly rest∣less began to rate him for disturbing her in such a manner as he did  Goaler  Why you must know my Dear that the Gentleman there our Prisoner prof∣fer'd me fifty Guineas if I shou'd let him out  Wife  Has he got the Money  Goaler  Has he Yes that he has twice as much I saw it but that a'ant the Thing I don't know what to do in it If as how I shou'd take the Money and it shou'd be blown why then Lord help me  Wife  Lord help you indeed you poor To∣ny who shou'd blow it indeed but your own self Howsomdever let me alone I'll find a Time to talk to him about it Sizes won't be these two Months and we heed nor be in a Hurry to get rid of him he's a special good Customer and a Power of the right Sort come after him  Goaler  That's all true my Dear  Wife  It's all a Fool's Head of your own my Dear as to the fifty Guineas we'll get it and he shan't get away neither  Goaler  No  Wife  No  Goaler  Lord if that cou'd be  Wife  Lord what a Wonderment you make about it but come turn to me and I'll tell ye I'll make the Bargain with him that one Night when you are gone out of Town you can make believe you know about going out of Town that I'll let him outso now do you mind me you know the Hosier's House which  is next to ours you have the Key of it and the  Frenchmens  Chamber where they broke thro' leads into that House and you know there are only some Boards nail'd against the Hole  Goaler  I take you my Dear  Wife  No but you don't so don't interrupt meI'll tell him as how I can let him into the empty House and give him the Key to let himself out into the Street provided that he will put the fifty Guineas into my Hands the Moment I have let him out of Prison into the empty HouseThis mun he'll agree to at once so then only mind me  Goaler  So I do  Betty  Wife  The Devil you do why you're going to sleep now you are  Goaler  No Child I a'nt so you had no Occasion to have given me such a Punch in my Side with your Elbow  Wife  Why then you shou'd answer me as you should do for you know I abo∣minatiously hate not to be minded so  as I was sayingWhere was I got to  Goaler  To the fifty Guineas my Dear  Wife  Oh ay so then he'll gi me the fifty Guineas into my Hand so then I'll give him the Key and leave him to unlock the Streetdoor where you must be waiting you know with some more Help so you'll seize him at once and bring him back again he can't accuse you you know and I'll go out of Town to my Uncle's he has wanted me to come a monstrous while and so then I won't come Home again till the Gentle∣man is hanged or acquitted so then there's the Money all snug and not a Soul in the varsal World ne'er the wiser  This Scheme as it was really a very deep one the Husband admired and they lay awake until Morning consider∣ing how and in what Way they should put out the fifty Guineas  Jack Junior  not having the second sighted Gift remained a Stranger to this Plot Observing the Husband not to take any Notice of it next Day hinted it to him again but the Goaler begged him for God's Sake not to think of it  for he wouldn't do such a Thing for the World  Perseverance is as much the Property of a Gamester as a Loverbut it would not dothe Man was still obstinate  Junior  changed his Plan sounded the Wife and found her very pliable she consented upon Consideration of  Junior  's giving her sixty Guineas she had a Mind to keep Ten to herself she would let Mr  Junior  out of the Goal into an empty House and give him the Key of the Street Door and he might let himself out but he must stay till the Nights were dark and her Husband gone out of Town  The long expected Time came at last her Husband was gone a Journey or at least pretended in  Junior  's Hear∣ing to do so  Junior  then went up with the Goaler's Wife into what was called the  French  Chamber and there he told out before her Face sixty Guineas after she had taken up several and exa∣mined them they that were not filed or false he replaced them in the Bag a∣gain tied up the Mouth and held it in his Hand ready to make her a Present of it the Moment she had conducted him past the Prison Walls She had a Candle and Lanthorn along with her  when they parted he received the Lan∣thorn and Candle she the Bag  Junior  entered the one Pair of Stairs of the Hosier's House she went to the Goaldoor to let her Husband know who was waiting there that the Gentleman was coming and then she went to her Bureau to lock up the Money  The most Cunning are frequently the greatest Dupes thus it was with  Junior  he had no Suspicion of the intended Am∣bush but merely by Instinct and Expe∣rience from former Practices he sat the Lanthorn down in a Corner and softly opened a Sash to look into the Street and listen if any Persons were passing At that Instant Mr Mayor's Coach hap∣pened to be going Home with his Wor∣ship and Family from a Visit and a Footman carrying a lighted Flambeaux behind illuminated the whole Street just as the Coach passed along  Junior  discovered underneath him several Per∣sons with Watchmen's Bills standing round the Door of the House he was in He had now need of all his Fortitude without shutting down the Sash softly on Tiptoe he stepped back again took the Lanthorn and hurried up Stairs in∣to the back Garrets in Search for a Trap∣door or Casement which opened upon  the Leads very luckily he found one quickly out he got and after a Trial or two found the Gutter would bear him along sideling he crept his Hands upon the Tiles until he was stopped by a Ladder which lay standing in his Way This he conjectured might have some Communication with others lower and after some Time feeling about for he had put out his Light he found a Bun∣dle of scaffolding Cords one End of which he made fast to the uppermost Ladder and depending on that and in Hopes of more Ladders he began to descend what with sliding and scram∣bling he found himself at last safe land∣ed in a narrow Lane just then he heard the Minster Clock strike One guided by that Sound he walked towards the Churchyard where he expected to find waiting for him a Friend and a couple of fleet Horses  For unknown to the Goalor'd Lady after he had fixed the Night and Hour in which he was to leave his Prison he ordered one in whom he could confide to be in the Minsteryard with a Brace of Geldings when the Clock struck Twelve and stay till  Junior  came  Jack  rightly judging it was a Place which at that Time of Night few Peo∣ple  would walk through therefore his Groom and Cattle might secrete them∣selves there and also  Junior  could find the Place more readily than any other  How did the Person in Waiting re∣joice when he heard  Junior  whistle the Signal Not that it was Joy proceeding from a Heartfelt Satisfaction to hear his Friend was at Libertynohe was glad he had got Company For Mr  Junior  's Assistant tho' one of the boldest Fellows living nay had actually fought a Duel yet began to be very uneasy as he staid a∣mong the Graves and Tombstones a cold Sweat bedewed his Face and Breast and he was at last so far Pannicstruck that when the Clock went Twelve he would have left  Junior  to get off alone as well as he could but had not Strength to get from the Tombstone on which he had laid himself at Length upon his Breast his Hands cross his Eyes  There is something so tremenduously gloomifical as Mr *** observes in a Churchyard at Midnight and only then as must appal the stoutest among Men This was what the Person declared to  Junior  after they had got the Town upon their Backs saying Look ye  Jack Junior  tho' as to Religion to be sure I know it all to be Priest∣craft  and as to Parsons they are no more knowing than other MenHow should they You know and every Body else knows I a'nt afeard of no∣thing yet damme if ever I was so out of Sorts as I was when I was among them Tombstones and if I could have said the Lord's Prayer by Heart or any Thing about the Bible I believe I should have pattered no∣thing else all the Time after the Clock struck Twelve for curse me  Jack Junior  tho' Iv'e more Sense than to believe a Word what such Fellurs as Par∣sons Jaw yet I'll hold five Pound to a Shilling and I say done first that no Man in the World can stay in a Churchyard at Midnight without sweating for it  Here would we give you the Answer his Companion made him but they both began to gallop along so fast hav∣ing found themselves on the Turnpike Road that they were too soon out of Earshot for us to take down even in short Hand the rest of their Conversa∣tion  Now to return to the Prisonkeeper after he and his Followers had waited themselves out of all Patience he dis∣patched his Wife back to go into the  very Place to which she had inducted  Junior  and see what was become of him As soon as she had been all over the House she bawled out of the Win∣dow  Jack  had left open Oh Lord he's got out aTop he has got out a Top The empty House Streetdoor they cou'dn't force open  Junior  had the Key in his Pocket they were forced to go round through the Goal and they soon discovered the Trapdoor open but not one would venture out alledging they had Families and who'd maintain their poor Babes if any Thing misfortunable was to happen to them∣selves  The Alarm by this Time was spread through the Neighbourhood that the Gentleman Murderer had made his Es∣cape the Mayor was informed of it and he sent immediately for the Goalor to be ascertained of the Truth of the Report  When her Spouse went to wait upon the Mayor Madam the Goalor's Lady retired to her Bedchamber opened her Chest of Drawers took out the Bag  Junior  had given her and united it to take Care of the ten supernumerary Pieces which as she had bargained for un∣known to her Husband she was unwil∣ling  he should come to hear of for Fear he might be angry with her  Out into her Lap she pours the pre∣cious Treasureahaoh my sweet Jesus Thus she shrieked out started up and down fell all the Contents of the Bag upon the Floor and she upon them dashing her Hands up and down among them for instead of sixty Guineas good and lawful Money of  Great Britain  there was nothing but small Leads of Sleeves thick Pieces of Glass ground round Pieces of Pewter and brass Curtain Rings There amidst the Heap like the Story of  Danae  done by a Sign∣post Painter she lay in a violent Fit not one Struggle of it feigned After burning all the Matches they could come at under her Nose it was as much as her Maid could do to keep her from relapsing  Her Spouse returned from Mr Mayor's with a very discontented Mind his Worship threatened him to take the Goalor's Place from him if the Prisoner was not forthcoming all he comforted himself as he walked Home was that let the worst come to the worst he had fifty Guineas to begin the World with  When he came into the Chamber where the Maid was sat on the Ground  holding his Wife's Head in her Lap and all the counterfeit Pieces scattered about her he cry'd out What the De∣vil and be damn'd to it is this  Wife  O Husband it's no Matterohbut we're ruined that's alloh Lordthen fell into another Fit which after some Trouble they brought her out of and she told her Husband that instead of the fifty Guineas the Rascal had given her that Stuff which lay about the Floor  Indeed some People are to be pitied for after he had listened with Astonish∣ment to her broken Relation often in∣terrupted with Sobs and was convinced he was undone without making her any Reply down Stairs he went to look for his Horsewhip and just as he had laid Hand on that he was laid Hands on by two of Mr Mayor's Officers and car∣ried by his Worship's Order to the black Hole for aiding  Junior  's Escape who was then with his Companion mak∣ing the best of his Way to  London  once more to cut a Figure but whether in the Sessionspaper as a Felon or in the Newspaper for marrying a great For∣tune Time only can be the Telltale  'Tis Odds indeed but that he is re∣warded for acting on the wrongside of  Equity sooner than punished for it which makes out what  Hamlet  observes about there being more Things in Hea∣ven and Earth than are found out by Philosophy if not we might account why Visagewearing Roguery shall dine upon Turtle and opencountenanc'd Honesty starve in  forma Pauperis  CHAP XX  MR  Fool  was very hospitably re∣ceived at the Mansionhouse to which by the Order of Mr  Borlace  he was carried  With the Lady who we have already mentioned to be in Possession of this Dwellingplace there boarded a young Gentlewoman to whom Mr  Borlace  was a great Favourite  As soon as their Guest Mr  Fool  was well enough recovered to see Company they made him a Visit at which Time  Borlace  observing all their Endeavours to dissipate his Melancholy were ineffectual first making a proper Apology for his Abruptness addressed Mr  Fool  as fol∣lows  Sir your Disorder does not seem en∣tirely to arise from any bodily Pains the Mind is I am afraid concerned in your Case I would not enquire into your Story out of a weak or illtimed Curiosity no Sir I have been unhap∣py myselfvery unhappythis young Lady has felt the severe Grasp of Cala∣mity we have all known what it has been to suffer if you'll give me Leave  Sir we'll relate to you our past Lives and you know Sir what we are taught at School that it is a Comfort to the Sorrowful to have Partners in Affliction  Tom Fool  I am indeed Sir very much hurt in my Mind yet should be grieved to find any one so unfortunate as I am  Mr Borlace  That Sir I leave you to judge my Name Sir is  Witwood Borlace  a Name I believe once as well known in the gay Life of  London  as  Fanny Murray  's I am a Man of Family and consequently a Man of Ambition but the Mode of my Mind was not constituted either for Field Sports at Home or Campaigns Abroad all my Wish Joy and Pride centered in being called a clever Fellow  To be a Man of Wit and Humour is a Character eagerly sought after like the great Prize in the Lottery and the World will put in because each Indivi∣dual thinks he may pretend to it But that's not the Thing every Lady is not born to be a Toast nor every Man to be a Genius  One Thing that led me to aim at so pleasing a Title was I had a prodigious Share of Spirits and from my Induction  at College to this present Time they never failed me  I was forced indeed to leave the University sooner than I expected on Account of the first Piece of Wit I ever attempted I put a Piece of hot Coal on my Tutor's Shoe as the old Fellow lay asleep it happened to lame him in∣deed but that was more than I intended  When I returned to my Father's I was ordered to prepare myself to make the grand Tour but an Aunt of mine objecting to him how weak it was in Parents sending their Sons Abroad be∣fore they had seen their own Country I had Liberty allowed me to go with her to  Tunbridge  I was soon take Notice of for my vast Spirits and made Principal in most Parties of Pleasure until the satyrical Talent which I possessed made me be thought too severe a Companion and I was in Consequence of that left out of several future Invitations  This pleased me for I was fond of being dreaded I lampooned away and enjoyed the Anxiety which it gave to se∣veral at the  Spaw  who would have poi∣soned me if they dared I had imbibed the Opinion from several Ladies of Fa∣shion  that to give Pain was the greatest Pleasure imaginable  My Father had been some Years a Widower and just as I came of Age dying left me a large unincumbered Estate with some Thousands in ready Money then I began to execute my Plan which was to be the tiptop Fel∣low for Fun Frolick Wit and Hu∣mour upon the Town  I gave over all Thoughts of going a∣broad being conscious that my own Country could furnish me with Curiosi∣ties enow for Entertainment however that I might not be disesteemed for a De∣ficiency of Taste I employed Persons who understood those Things to furnish me with a proper Quantity of Pictures Etchings Medals Bronzes Cameo's Intaglias Antiques and Petrifactions  While my House Cabinets and Cu∣riosities were fitting up in  London  I went to an Estate I had in  Cornwall  with half a Dozen excessive droll Fellows to practise all the Species of Wit and Hu∣mour I intended to be excellent in  After being absent a Year I burst on the Town a Prodigy I was allowed to be the greatest Genius that ever embellished an Evening's Conversation I could take off  Ryan  and the blind Man with his  Bladder and String I could play upon my Coat's Skirt like a Bagpipe and make an old Woman's Face upon my Hand I could make a Fiddle go like a  German  Flute and grunt with my Mouth like an Organ could do all the  London  Cries and play a Solo upon a Broomstick sound a Trumpet from the Corner of my Hat and play a Volun∣tary by snapping my Fingers I was the best Hand in  England  upon the Salt∣box and nobody sung the  Welch  Song like me then I could growl like  Quin  and squint like Parson  Whitfield  and every Body allowed at my own Table I said as many good Things as any Man in  England  There we was one Thing very remark∣able about me which was tho' I had an excessive Share of Spirits they never hurried me into any particular Extrava∣gancies I detested Gaming as to tos∣sing up for the Reckoning now and then or buying a few Lottery Tickets just to make Presents with those were Trifles not worth talking of and what would not hurt any Body but I was determined never to be taken in So tho' I have had all the tiptop Women of the Town they never had me they loved me as a clever Fellow but I was too knowing  to be a Keeper I have indeed some∣times made one Lady a Present of a Piece of Plate and folded up a Bankbill two or three Times and flung it by way of Frolick at another What then I was not scheemed out of it tho' I used to lie with them they never had a Penny from me as to any Thing else who the Devil would deny giving a fine Woman now and the forty or fifty Gui∣neas provided a Man was not made their Dupe which they honestly confes∣sed to me I was not they could not fi∣nesse me  While I was amusing myself in this Manner I received a little Damage from a Gentleman whose Wife I had toasted as a  Demirep  I retired into the Country a little while to recruit both my Consti∣tution and Circumstances for tho' I had not been very high above five Years I had somehow or other run my Estate a little out of Breath  During my being rusticated I mar∣ried an Heiress with l in her own Hands which she put me in Possession of on the Day of Marriage but had she not been one of the finest Women in  England  as to Person her Money should never have made me trammel myself in the matrimonial Tether I was  always too full of Spirits for a domestic sedentary Life I could not bear Con∣finement cooped up like a tame Rab∣bit no I must run wild about the Fo∣rest like a free bred Buck or as  Lo∣thario  says like the Birds great Na∣ture's happy Commoners  I brought my Bride up to Town to let the World bear Witness to my Hap∣piness I showed her off at every public Place she was not quite so fond of Os∣tentation as she ought to have been I could perceive Operas and Routs not so infinitely agreeable to her as I could have wished them she was rather too rural in her Taste for by all that's odd she whispered me in the Ear only at the second Masquerade we were at that she thought it very insipid Superlatively simple you must suppose her to be not but now and then she was well enough In her Opinion as far as an  English  Au∣thor or as  Garrick  's acting any Thing in the serious Way pleased her well enough  There is something in that  Garrick  's Execution excessively clever I can I believe without Vanity do as many droll Things as all the choice Spirits put together but I don't know how it is I never could get at what he does as to  the rest of the Actors I was at Home but he has got a Sort of a Knack that's past finding out and yet he seems so easy in what he does as if it was natural to him I believe in acting as well as free Masonry there's a Secret not to be divulged I beg Pardon Sir for this Observation but theatrical Knowledge is as useful for a Man of Fortune in  London  as classical Knowledge is at the University  My Wife after we had been in Town about two Months began tho' in the most tender Manner to complain I ab∣sented myself too much from her wish'd to have a little more of my Company begged me since I was so very entertain∣ing Abroad that I would indulge her now and then with my Conversation at Home It went against me I must confess to deny her but I had so many Invitations and was so universally ad∣mired as a Companion I could not help it as to pleasing one's Wife or the Pleasure a Man can receive from her Ap∣plause it was not forcible enough for one of my Spirits yet I made a secret Resolution altho' I was too much from her at present when I grew old she should have me all to herself  I have sometimes since thought that a Man may have too great a Quantity of Spi∣rits for I could not stay at Home and I was fearful too if I had that the World would have given out I had drowned my Faculties in the Cawdlecup The Ambition I had to be counted the cle∣verest Fellow in  England  forced me to enter too much into the Spirit of Things I sat up too late drank too deep used rather too much Ridicule and slighted the finest Woman in  England  and all often against my Inclination but he who has a Mind to gain a great Name must sacrifice his private Connections to the Opinions of the Public  My Wife to wean me as she thought from what here Country Simplicity called dangerous Habits told me that most of my Friends tho' she would not parti∣cularize them were Villains that they had at different Times hinted Love to her therefore begged me to be more at Home if it was only to protect her from such Insults for the future  But I saw through the Scheme she was a good Girl but a bad Politician I smiled and told her Politeness and Sincerity were as incompatible as  Hudi∣bras  and Algebra or common Sense and much Ceremony that the more Men  made Love to my Wife only proclaim'd the more the Goodness of my Taste in fixing upon so inestimable a Jewel I was conscious I told her she loved me bid her not be whimsical chucked her under the Chin vowed I adored her ordered a Chair and dined with  Lucy Cooper  I must confess I believe the Lady I married was not only one of the finest Women in  England  but as good a one as ever lived I had not indeed an Opportunity to discover all her good Qualities but this was the Character every Body gave her I should not have been a Stranger to her Perfections had not an unlucky Accident happened which deprived me from considering her in so amiable a Light as I ought to have done but Reflections are ridiculous few People know the Value of an Es∣tate till they have made away with it  Thus it happen'd with me Sir I had not been married to her much above a Twelvemonth before I lost her that was another Joke carried a little too far too But a Man at all Times don't know where to stop when he is in high Spirits  You must know Sir on Afternoon my Wife then had just been brought to  Bed a Week I had dined that Day at  Tomkyns  's I was in high Spirits and took three or four Friends Home with me to hum an old Parson a Relation of my Wife's whom I had promised to spend the Evening with I knew I shou'd undergo a Jobation from him but to stop his Mouth Sir  Grecian Grigg  and I began a sham Fight in the old one's Company  One of my Wife's foolish Maids run screaming to her Mistress that I shou'd be murdered among the drawn Swords and in spite of her Servants my Wife was so Headstrong that she wou'd come down Stairs only in her Wrapper and Slippers altho' she had not lain in above seven or eight Days  We soon convinc'd her it was only a Piece of Wit and Humour but to see how uneven the Tempers of some La∣dies are tho' she tripp'd down Stairs as nimble as a Wench at a Wake her Spirits took such a Turn that it was as much as all her Maids cou'd do to lift her up Stairs againShe died in three Day's Time I fancy she was piqued to be taken in so  However no Man cou'd be more afflicted at parting from his Wife than I was I had lost one of the finest Figures  in  England  Indeed I erected a fine Monument for her and kept my Room a whole Week to compose her Epitaph and without Vanity I may say that no Husband cou'd give more unfeign'd Testimonies of his Affection than I did in the Care I took of having her Memory celebrated  After her Decease I found my richest and greatest Friends discontinued their Visits I was in Repartee too severe for I never wou'd sink my Joke to save my Friend no wonder then they ab∣sented themselves as they had the Laugh so often against them especially now they knew the only Person was gone who took their Parts  I had then no other Visitors but those whose Circumstances made it worth their while to fill their Bellies at my Table tho' they were sure to be roasted for it I soon grew tired with those to whom I gave a Dinner only because they wanted one their Applauses were as insipid to me as the Caresses of a Wife three Months after Marriage I left off Housekeeping took Lodgings near  Arthur  's and was balloted into the Jockey Club  Here was a new Field for Game I cleared away a few Acres of Woodland  just to make an exercising Place run up a rubbing House bought a Brace of brood Mares got my Compliment of Colts and just till my own Stud was risen four Years old I purchased three or four capital Plate Horses for as I was determined to be distinguished I knew there was no doing those Things by Halves and to compleat me for the Turf I had several Hints from  Pond  how to lay my Money  I began rather too late I believe for tho' no Man ever had better Horses than myself nor won more Plates nor was oftener let into the Secret yet damn it let them say what they will there is such a Thing as  uck ay and bad Luck too for in about five Years my Estate my Horses and Grooms all gallopped away to the Devil leaving me at a dead Standstill in a Spunginghouse tho' there I had the Satisfaction to hear the Baileys allow that they be∣lieved me to be one of the cleverest Gentlemen in  England  After I had recovered my Liberty I entered into Life as droll as ever I was not quite so rich tho' But what is Mo∣ney to a Man of Spirit I used to treat now I was treated tossed into the Reckoning but I was welcome every  where and every Body admired my vast Sprits  Tom Fool  Pray Sir did not you begin to think  Borlace  No Sir when a Man of Wit and Humour begins to think he loses all Pretensions to those Titles as a Beauty ceases to be a Toast when she becomes a married Woman Besides I really lived so joyous I had no Time for Reflection I used to be engaged from Party to Party that I had no Hours to myself nor indeed did I wish for any I was just like a new celebrated Woman of Pleasure every one wished to be in Company with me  As to the Woman of the Town I visited all of them and knew every  De∣mirep  and fresh Face and as it was not in my Power to be as generous to them as I had been I resolved to be use∣ful in helping them to several rich Bucks of my Acquaintance who could not so conveniently have met together had I not contrived it I did it to serve my Friends and looked upon it as a Point of Honour so did the Girls for tho' Prudes may say what they will those Sort of Women have more Honour a∣bout them than People imagine They  always received me with open Arms but a Man may be sick with Sweetmeats I was at last in that sickly Condition which the modest Part of the female Sex have no Pity for  When I was tolerably well an old Acquaintance of mine invited me down to his Country Seat for the Summer This was a real Piece of Friendship I told him so when I consented to the Pro∣posal His Answer was why look ye  Borlace  you are a damn'd droll Fellow to be sure and can keep it up as well as any Man in  England  therefore you'll be quite in Character with me for as the general Election is coming such a Man as you among my Friends is worth a Thousand  Away we went in tiptop Spirits Faith I shan't tire you with the Tricks we played upon the Road about our humming the Parsons or frightening old Women with telling them the  French  were landed and our Fleets beat nor alarming the Country Towns at Mid∣night with crying Fire It was indeed one of the highest Journies I ever tra∣velled  After we had been some Time keep∣ing open House the Country Gentle∣men came forty Miles round to see and  hear me I began to be so necessary to my Friend for I could drink when he could not and sing he knew no Songs and tell Stories and he had no Humour that at last he swore to me as we sat over the Remains of a Bowl of Arrack every one else had left us it was about four o'Clock in the Morning he swore he would settle two hundred Pounds a Year upon me for Life and make a Point of it he swore squeezing me heartily by the Hand at the same Time that I was the cleverest Fellow in  Eng∣land  and should live independantly  But I was out of Luck for it was but next Evening I gave Judgment against my Friend and Patron that was to be about his holding a foul Card He did hold it to be sure and I was half fuddled and said he did immediately he flung a Bottle at my Head and or∣dered his Servants to turn me out of Doors About four in the Morning I was set adrift without a single Penny in my Pocket or knowing where to raise one  However I came to a Resolution to earn the Bread I should eat for the future and let it be ever so mean an Employ I was resolved to seek for a Livelihood There were several Ways that I could  maintain myself in for 'tis a very vul∣gar Error to say a Gentleman is not brought up to any Thing  I was qualified as Coachman or Cockfeeder or a Gamekeeper or a Whipperin or a riding Groom but I could not get Business in any of those Employments because those to whom I proffered myself objected to my being a Gentleman and I had no Body could give me a Character at last after hav∣ing put myself into a proper Dress I got myself hired to make Hay  In a Week's Time I found a won∣derful Alteration in myself for the better in Respect of Health and Quiet I fell asleep when Night came without being obliged first to get drunk by way of Opiate I waked next Morning neither sick sorry nor ashamed by the bitter Remembrance of how much like a Mad∣man I had behaved over Night I soon lost a Hoarseness which long had plagued me My Legs fell into their proper Shape my Wind was mended my Eyes ceased smarting my Hands were steady at Breakfast Time my Flesh grew firm and I wanted no Wine and Bitters to make me eat my Dinner  Thus I liv'd Sir for a whole Twelve∣month employed in one Part or other  of Country Business till Providence con∣ducted me to this House it was fitting up for this Gentlewoman I was Over∣seer of the Workmen and since I am employed for her Here we live retired we have every Thing we wish for among ourselves we have seen the World and despise heartily despise its Vices and Fol∣lies and would not again be intoxicated with them for more than ever we were formerly worth no not all the Pains and Penalties of the Inquisition could ever push me into the same Path again  Thus Mr  Borlace  entertained Mr  Fool  binding with several Oaths his Disapprobation of every Irregularity and that it was impossible for him ever again to run into the same Errors Mr  Fool  took Mr  Borlace  to be indeed re∣formed nay Mr  Borlace  believed him∣self to be soWho would notBut alas How can we pretend to know and read Mankind when we are Strangers to ourselves At least this was Mr  Borlace  's Case for tho' he promised and vowed so ardently against late Hours bad Company and many Bumpers it is not above seven to four or seven and a half to four at most but if he had the same Opportunities Abilities and Temp∣tations  he would do the same Things he had done  Reader be not in Wrath that our Characters are not compleatly good ei∣ther after Marriage or Repentance We endeavour to exhibit Life not ac∣cording to our Wishes but Observa∣tions and as we copy from Nature must do as Nature has done Only let me beg of thee to observe the ingenious Exhibitions of Mr  Hogarth  who is among Painters what Dean  Swift  was among Poets His Performances must please thee according to the Abilities thou hast to be pleasedYet seldom doth he present us with perfect Beauties in his Figures the Reason is obvious like  Shakespear  he is one of Nature's Agents and therefore must act accord∣ing to her Commissions  In the anatomical Figures made by Monsieur  Denoüe  which were not good enough for an  English  Collection every Part of Nature is laid open he aimed not to flatter but instruct Some Things indeed might shock his Pupils but they were Truths they ought to be acquaint∣ed with  CHAP XXI  AFTER Mr  Borlace  had ended his Story the youngest of the Ladies turning to  Tom Fool  thus be∣gan her's  My Father Sir was a Baronet his Name Sir  Philpot Fool  We must leave it entirely to the Reader's Imagina∣tion to form an ideal Picture of her Bro∣ther's Astonishment He ran to her threw his Arms about her Neck and as well and fast as the Joy of such a Meeting would allow him to be articulate he discovered himself to her The rest of the Day was spent in hearing every particular Transaction of his Life from his Ad∣mittance into Lady  Grotto  's House to his Delivery from the Stone Pit  Next Morning the two Ladies begg'd Mr  Fool  's Company into their Dressingroom As soon as they were all seated the eldest Gentlewoman to prepare the Brother to receive calmly a Relation of his Sister's Distresses began by way of Preamble to observe the vast Force of Passion how much Inclination was stronger than Reason and that Wo∣man's Will was like a Whirlwind  Then hinted about Heat of Blood Pre∣judice of Education Hurry of Youth Deceit of Mankind and all the other la∣mentable Topics so copiously declaimed upon by those who do err and those who pretend to say they do not  Tom Fool  interrupted the Speaker by taking hold of his Sister's Hand and pressing it tenderly betwixt both his with the utmost Affection in his Face He replied my dear Girl do not con∣ceal the Truth from your Brother your Brother is your Friend My dear God forbid I shou'd hold you hard in my Esteem since I have been so culpable myself  Miss  Ninny  's History  The Reason my dear Brother that Sir  Philpot  took no Notice of you after your being some Time at School was owing to a great Quarrel between him and my Mama  A Greyhound which was a great Fa∣vourite of my Papa's kill'd her Lady∣ship's  Chinese  Pheasant My Mama made the Shepherd's Boy shoot the Hound directly but the Moment Sir  Philpot  heard of it he snatch'd her green  Parrot off his Perch and with his own Hands wrung the Head off  My Mama Brother had a Spirit be∣coming a Woman of QualityA noble Spirit indeedshe never wou'd forgive an Insult but her Revenge she wou'd have let the Consequence be what it wou'd and I own myself so much of her Mind that altho' I have sometimes suffer'd for it I wou'd show a proper Resentmentay and will tho' I was sure to lose my Life by it  When her Ladyship saw her Parrot murder'd she flew into the Picture Gal∣lery and cut Holes in all the fine Paint∣ings which when Sir  Philpot  saw he burst open her  China  Closetdoor and broke every Thing to smash in it This was a terrible Stroke this my Mama cou'd not bear she fell into violent Hy∣sterics and on the Instant she was able to crawl knowing you to be Papa's Favourite she made an Affidavit that you were a Bastard  This Action stupified Sir  Philpot  for three or four Days afterwards he spoke to no body but sat in his own Room like a Man moped and on  Sunday  Morning it makes me shudder when I think on't Papa shot himself thro' the Head but what was the cruellest of all  he carried his Resentment beyond the Grave for he sent a long Letter to his particular Friend about half an Hour before he committed the Fact wherein he gave his Reasons for what he was about to do and begg'd the Gentleman by their long Intimacy and as he regarded the Words of his dying Friend that he wou'd make that Letter Public and by that prove he was not Lunatic when he kill'd himself so that his Family shou'd not inherit the Estate  The Gentleman to whom the Letter was sent liv'd about twenty Miles off and he and Sir  Philpot  had been School∣fellows together and no two were ever more intimate but the Gentleman was generous enough to show this Letter to my Mama and me no body else He was a Counsellor at Law and begg'd her Ladyship not to be uneasy he wou'd take Care of every Thing for her  How the Affairs were managed I cant' tell I suppose there are some par∣ticular Methods in the Law which when People know how to make use of they need not fear any Thing at least I heard the Counsellor tell her Ladyship so Sir  Philpot  's Letter instead of being pub∣lished was burn'd And when the Co∣roner  came he was a mighty civil Man and brought in a proper Verdict by which we saved the Estate  Perhaps Brother you may wonder that after my Mama had got clear of those Difficulties something was not done for you but really Lady  Philpot  at first would not hear a Word of Family Affairs because as her Ladyship ob∣serv'd they put her too much in Mind of the late unhappy Accident And as she was and you must remember Bro∣ther a very fine Woman she was sur∣rounded with Acquaintance And to dissipate her Grief she was hurried into so much Company that we had not a Moment to ourselves or for ourselves  For really Brother People of Fashion have more fatiguing Lives than the lower Set of Mortals wou'd believe Those Persons of Distinction I mean who are willing to appear as such for what with receiving and returning Visits Auction Day's Dressing and Undressing Opera Nights Routs Assemblies Break∣fastings Plays Airing in  HydePark  and  Vauxhall  Parties once or twice in the Seasons I do assure you we are in a continual Flutter of Dissipations and it must therefore be expected that fine Women instead of thinking about  Home are too much hurried to think about any thing  But now Brother I am to claim the Forgiveness you have promised me I shall faithfully relate Matters of Fact just as they happened I was barely Sixteen when we appear'd Abroad again and Lady  Philpot  contrary to other Parents was pleas'd to carry me every where with her But how unhappy are the young Part of our Sex who are shown into Life unaccompanied with a proper Guide our Minds tainted insensibly by our In∣timatesI am sure however that mine was  After Dinner when the Ladies are withdrawn Gentlemen as I've been told over their Bottle often converse toge∣ther very loosely Our Sex I assure you at sometimes are not much behind Hand with yours as to the Topics of their Discourse only we are I fancy more delicate in our Phrases  I had some very intimate Acquain∣tances Ladies who were rather older than myself but were full as sprightly and to use their own Words hated Pru∣dery From them I was instructed in such Things My God I have heard of People whose Brains have been turn'd by Pride one Passion will intoxicate the  Understanding as much as another I was almost mad for Enjoyment to such a Pitch I had heighten'd my Ima∣gination  I cou'd think talk or hear of no∣thing else and only the Fear of being refus'd prevented me from asking the first Man I met the Question they had made me imagine it must be all Elysium  A Gentleman just at this Time one of our Neighbours in the Country ask'd my Mama's Consent to pay his Ad∣dresses to me Upon his bare Promise of Marriage which I only took to save Appearances I admitted him to stay all Night with me in my Bedchamber there I gave myself up to all those pro∣mis'd Toys dying Murmers and swim∣ming Extasies I had so long and so fondly fancied  But Enjoyment answer'd not at all the Idea which I had entertain'd of it Next Morning I honestly declar'd so to my LoverConfess'd to him that it was Curiosity which had engag'd me in In∣trigue that I expected to have met with more than I cou'd express to himbut I found myself horridly disappointed it was to me the most momentary of all Gratifications no sooner felt than fled  troublesome and indelicate but the Pleasure of a Dream in a Moment vanish'd  My Gallant seem'd astonish'd and af∣ter he had recover'd himself as brutal and gross enough to tell me in his Reply I was the only Woman who had ever found Fault with his Abilities had I been a Man I cou'd have fell'd him to my Foot for the mean Opinion he had of me I contented myself with cooly replying to him it was not the Actor but the Deed which I disliked and protested I never more wou'd engage in any such Affair From thenceforth for some Time never thought any more about it except it was to despise those who extoll'd it as the ultimate of human Happiness  Still this Gentleman persisted in my granting him the same Favours as I had done I wou'd not he grew ten Times more importunate I was oblig'd at last to beg my Mama wou'd forbid him the House she did so and added it was done at my Request This so far piqu'd him that he immediately related to her what had pass'd betwixt us and not contented with that went to the Tavern and among all his Acquaintance told all I had granted him  It is impossible for me to describe the Rage I was in my Passion was so vio∣lent it threw me into a Fever but my Hope of Revenge contributed more than the Physician to my Recovery When I was just able to walk out a Gentleman who lived in the next House to Lady  Fool  's met me as I was taking the Air He accosted me with the utmost Re∣spect spoke with much Warmth against the Villainies of the Age we liv'd in particularis'd the several Follies his Sex were guilty of and dwelt a long Time on the wicked Vanity of those Cox∣combs who as  Horatio  said fancied Raptures that they never knew and I was charm'd to hear him He conti∣nued his Discourse assuring me that he thought it the Duty of every Gentleman to vindicate injur'd Beauty and begg'd my Permission to be allow'd my Cham∣pion  By this Time we had reach'd our House I begg'd he'd alight and walk in with me I led him into Sir  Philpot  's Study and there I confess'd to him that his manner of Expression had w  n me to think nobly of him that I was not so much irritated against the Scandal as I was at the Author of it This Gentle∣man  promis'd he wou'd punish the villain∣ous Boaster in the most exemplary Way nay he swore it upon the Bible before me that Evening and that Evening to encourage him in his Attempt I ge∣nerously made him a present of my Person  Is it to be believ'd Nay wou'd it be believ'd That this my second Pos∣sessor was an Accomplice with the first But so it was this latter Villain had it seems taken a Fancy to me and with the Help of the first laid this Scheme to get me I was innocently aiding this Piece of Baseness every Day expecting to hear of my first Gallant's Return from  London  It had been agreed upon by me that his Punishment shou'd be on the very Spot where he had propagated the Report but he kept out of Town on purpose till the other shou'd be tired of me They carried on a strict Corre∣spondence together this I did not dis∣cover until I had been upwards of a Month a Slave to his Desires I call it so it was so I'm sure to me  Mrs  Vielled  the elderly Gentlewoman  Ay and so it is to most of us that I insist on  Miss Ninney  A Letter I happened to find in my Room which dropp'd out of the Con∣federate's Pocket open'd the whole Plot to me I was for a Week almost ready for  Bedlam  but my Resolution to be re∣veng'd overcame my Distraction Just then Mr  Borlace  came up to acquaint Mr  Fool  there had been a Horseman at the Door who enquired for such a Per∣son as you are Sir but continued  Wit∣wou'd  tho' he describ'd Mr  Fool  ex∣actly and pretended to be one of his Servants I have seen too much of the World ever to believe what a Stranger says so I told him I knew nothing of you and he gallop'd away in a Hurry  Mr  Fool  thanked  Borlace  for his Care yet wish'd he cou'd have seen the Fellow for then as he observ'd he must have known if he really belong'd to him or was an Imposter  Why this it is reply'd  Borlace  to overthink one's Self I thought of every Scheme but that and that as it hap∣pens was the only one I shou'd have thought on But however Reflection without the Power of Recall is like playing a Game of Whist at second Hand  Come Ladies Dinner is upon the Table I hope Mr  Fool  will excuse this Interruption  Reader we hope thou wilt also ex∣cuse this Interruption but a Hackney Writer as well as a Hackney Horse must bait now and then or he never will get to the end of his Journey  CHAP XXII  Conclusion of Miss  Ninny  's History  THERE came down at this Time upon a Party of Pleasure with some more Gentlemen a Colonel of Horse It was always customary for every Stranger to be invited to Lady  Fool  's for my Mama was excessively fond of Visitors This Officer bore the best of Characters and his Behaviour was so very engaging that every body court∣ed his Company Lady  Philpot  I found was very particular in her Behaviour to him and he seem'd to tell me by Eyes he had rather have half such Civilities from me  Both Villains were now in Town for the Week following there was to be the Races I cou'd not sleep to think how basely I had been abused and had yet found no Way to redress myself After some Time deliberating I resolv'd to apply to the Officer I just now men∣tion'd I ingenuously related to him my whole Story and begg'd his As∣sistance  The two who had used me so basely were Men of great Fortune it was therefore not any way a lessening to his Character for him to call them to an Account He gave me his Honour he wou'd do it and the first Day in the Race Week at the Ordinary he forc'd my first Lover to confess publickly that every Thing which he had said of me was purely Invention acknowledg'd himself to be a Rascal and was usher'd down Stairs accordingly  My second Gallant who had that Morning in the Cockpit expos'd a  Cy∣press  Handkerchief which he took off my Dressingtable but had told every body I had given it him was stealing away on Tiptoe after he had been a Witness to the Disgrace of his Friend but the Colonel who had an Eye upon him stepping betwixt him and the Door stopp'd him saying at the same time to him calling him by his Name and you Sir who pretend to distinguish yourself by the Title of a Gentleman Where is the Trophy you have gloried in so this Morning Here here my dear Cap∣tain reply'd the other and trembling held out the Handkerchief to him and who says the Colonel when he received it looking my Gallant stedfastly in the  Face who gave you this Favour do you say Sir No no no body pon my Soul Colonel I found it in the Assemblyroom last Night that was his Answer  A Laugh eccho'd round the Room and the Colonel ordering the Doorway to be clear'd sent him out with the same Orders his Companion had receiv'd This News was brought Home to me immediately and I hope my Brother won't give me up entirely to Censure if I confess I did not long hesitate how I shou'd reward my Hero I was always violent in what I resolv'd upon eager to indulge the Resentment regardless of the future and what I once intended to gratify I was ever resolute to ac∣complish  Mrs Veilled  I never knew it otherways with young Persons who had Passions but Lord help me I have been a long while out of the World for I have lately heard a Gentleman say that there are a Set of very gaydress'd Figures of both Sexes about the Town now who seem entirely divested of all Passions and yet they have all the Marks of Liveliness about them They look without Expression they talk without Meaning and listen without Understanding they move me∣chanically  meer Machines like Showimages for Taylors and Milliners to dis∣play their Workmanship upon he call'd them Expletives in Society and com∣par'd them to Weeds in Blossom  Miss Ninny  Lady  Fool  one Day surpriz'd the Co∣lonel along with me and from that Time began to treat me with vast Severity The Counsellor my Mama's Friend got all our Estate into his Hands by one Means or other persuaded my Mamma to sign first one Parchment and then another on purpose as my Lady thought to prevent me from having any Share in it for it is incredible to how vast a Height her Hate was carried a∣gainst me  The Colonel was commanded into  Flanders  where he was kill'd Lady  Philpot  soon after broke up Housekeep∣ing and went to the Counsellor's and I with a little Pocketmoney went to board at my Maid's Mother's Lady  Philpot  declar'd I must never presume to expect any Assistance from her  I was at a small Farmhouse where the good People who liv'd in it thought they never cou'd do enough for me I had indeed always been very kind to their Daughter So you see Brother  tho' Gratitude is not to be found in fine Houses it may sometimes be met with under a thatch'd Roof I had not been in this Retirement above a Fortnight before their only Son came to see them from  London  As soon as he had a Sight of me he swore there was not such a fine Figure upon the Town I did not understand the Meaning of his Speech but I wish'd as he was a welllooking young Man and talk'd much of the Money he got and the fine Company he kept my Person cou'd win so far upon him that he wou'd make me his Wife  There was nothing I hope wicked in the Wish I was drove almost to Despair and the only Consolation I had was in now and then reflecting how justly the two Villains had been punish'd who betray'd me After my Maid's Brother had been in the Country with us for three Weeks he paid his Addresses to me and prof∣fer'd to marry me The Time had been when such a Proposal wou'd have been answer'd by a Horsepondducking But now what cou'd I do Oh Brother if there is one State on Earth more mise∣rable than another it is that of a Person of Fashion fallen to Decay We were  lawfully married at the Parish Church and next Week we went up to  London  At first I was a little chagrin'd to find my Spouse was only a Waiter at a noted Tavern in  Pallmall  and all the Noble∣men he boasted of being so intimate with always when he spoke of them calling them by their Christian Names of  Dick Harry Tom Will George  and so on were his Master's Guests  However he hired me very genteel Lodgings and took me to all public Places and often urg'd me to dress in a more gaudy showey Way than I had been used to insisting to me it was all Mode But I who had really been brought up as a Gentlewoman ought cou'd soon see the Difference between what was really elegant and the Affectation of it Con∣tinually was my Spouse praising one Man of Title or another to me for their Wealth and Generosity and telling me as soon as they came to Town he shou'd bring them to see me This Discourse at first I cou'd not readily comprehend However at last I made shift to find out that he married me only to make a Property of me and like the Wine he bottled serve me up to some of his Men of Quality  In a few Days he brought Home a very gaydress'd and very polite Gentle∣man and left us together I am not very patient under a trifling Injury but such an Affront as this was much more than I cou'd bear I burst into Tears the Gentleman my Visitor seem'd much surprised made me many Apolo∣gies and took his Leave of me very gen∣teely promising me his Protection  When my I don't know what to call him came Home there is not in Language a Name base enough to call him by who wou'd sell his Wife When he heard how coldly I had be∣hav'd to this his Patron as he call'd him he beat me lock'd me into a Gar∣ret fed me for a Week upon only Bread and Water and threaten'd to have me confin'd in Madhouse  But this Behaviour he found was lost upon me I inherited too much of my Mama's Temper to submit to such U∣sage He then tried gentler Methods with me at last let me live as I pleas'd only I was now and then oblig'd to bear a Visit from the Gentleman he first in∣troduc'd to me I did neither fret in∣wardly or show any Signs of Dislike either by my Behaviour or Conversation Indeed I was determin'd to be reveng'd  not only upon the Wretch to whom I had given my Hand but also upon this Patron he I resolv'd shou'd take a Share in my Resentment For this very Per∣son the Man of great Rank and con∣sequently of great Honour had been privy as I accidentally discover'd to all the cruel Treatment I had receiv'd from my Barbarian They according to the Gamester's Phrase play'd into each o∣ther's Hands just to make a poor help∣less Woman their Bubble Was it not right then think you in me if I endea∣vour'd to turn the Tables upon them  The Person whom I have so often mention'd that profess'd himself so stre∣nuously my Admirer was a married Man I went to his Lady related my Story to her and begg'd her Pro∣tection Whether in telling my Story I made her or her Husband look Little I can't tell but after having ey'd me from Head to Foot before she spoke her Face fill'd with Disdain she replied that she wonder'd immensely at my Im∣pertinence how I dared to have the Va∣nity to be so horribly absurd a to ima∣gine HER Spouse a Man of HIS Taste wou'd have any thing to say to such a Fright to such a vulgar Creature as I was and charg'd me never to dare to  under her Roof again upon Pain of be∣ing committed to  Bridewell  How I got Home I can hardly de∣scribe my Limbs trembled with Pas∣sion I was in such an Agony my Speech fail'd meBut luckily recollecting I had Revenge in my Power I soon came to myself My Wretch was gone to his Drawership's Business I dispatch'd a Card to the  Smyrna  Coffeehouse to the very Gentleman I had just been complaining or to his Lady He came immediately I told him that as he had often promis'd me his Protection I had taken the Liberty now to demand it He enquired in what manner he cou'd best serve me I replied my Husband was hateful to me as indeed he was and till I was releas'd from such a Wretch I wou'd never let any Man see my Face but hide myself down in the Country where it shou'd be impossible to find me  The Villain to whom I had been married was immediately sent for Ar∣ticles of Separation were immediately drawn He was immediately oblig'd to sign them tho' he fell on his Knees wrung his Hands begg'd me for God's Sake not to part from him Had he be∣hav'd to me but like a Man the World should not have parted us but I remem∣bered  the Usage I had received from him Resentment kept me silent and altho' it was but a mean Revenge I con∣fess I enjoy'd the Anxiety he endur'd and left him without so much as saying Adieu and found myself once more a free Woman in very elegantfurnish'd Lodgings at  Charingcross  I took Care to let the Lady who had so scornfully threatned me see by my Dress and Equipage that so vulgar a Creature as me cou'd be taken Notice of I was resolv'd she shou'd know also who it was that supported me in such Splendor it was that on which I de∣pended to compleat my Triumph over her As soon as she cou'd be convinc'd I was maintain'd by her Husband all her Haughtiness vanish'd She sent her own Brother to me with a Proposition to this effect That if I wou'd break off my Connection with her Spouse I shou'd have an Annuity of fifty Pounds a Year settled upon me and a hundred Guineas down  The Situation this Gentleman described his Sister to be in the happy Life they had always lived before and the Distrac∣tions which were like to ensue betwixt two noble Families determined me to  consent to a final Separation nay I did more for by my Means a thorough Reconciliation was made between the Gentleman who I had parted from and his Spouse He has ever since been one of the most indulgent Husbands and at his Lady's Desire as a Testimony of her Opinion of me has enlarg'd my annual Pension to fourscore Pounds a Year  CHAP XXIII  TOM FOOL sat attentive to his Sister while she related her Dis∣tresses attentive as a sensible Audience which follows Mr  Garric  thro' all the Workings of  Lear Hamlet  c c the whole Pit seem inform'd with one Soul smile when he smiles weep when he mourns and like a fine In∣strument play'd upon by a skillful Per∣former produces excellent Harmony  Thus was Mr  Fool  agitated during his Sister's Story After she had finish∣ed tenderly embracing her he thank'd her for the good Opinion she had of him in so ingenuously relating her Misfor∣tunes  Than he began a fine Discourse about the Passions and Reason and Prudence and Debauch At least if he did not say so the Editor might do it for him But alass all Selfdenial Subjects are be∣come so hacknied among Mankind that those very Topics which are so elo∣quently expatiated in the  Athenian  Porti∣cos are' at this Day dismally groan'd out in  TottenhamCourt  Tabernacle  Mute therefore be Declamation and turn we to the Dowager Lady of the Manor who had been silent almost all the Time Miss had been speaking Yet like a Person out out at the Whisktable wishing the Rubber was over  Mrs  Veilleid  bowing her Head as Mr  Fool  was expressing his Sentiments upon his Sister's Adventures begging Pardon for interrupting him thus the elderly Lady held forth The Pleasures of Life are much like the old Proverb great Cry and little Wool I have seen many Scenes of Life and am sick of all I have seen Unhappy Women as your Sister very well knows see hear and know more than most Folks imagine and were we to declare all we have ex∣perienced Mankind wou'd be asham'd to look one another in the Face  Poets pester us with Precedents of  Eve Cleopatra  and the  Ephesian  Matron We are frail very frail but what Man can boast of Infallibility except the Pope And I don't think his Opinion is held to be Orthodox We are accused of ruining Mankind of making Men mad but I speak from Experience they are mad before we have any Thing to do with them mad to be with us mad while they are with us and as mad to  leave us all their Lives only contrary Fits of madness  I once was mantain'd by a Person whom the World call'd a great Man He seem'd to be very fond of me but his Desires were indelicate irregular and sometimes preposterous He was pro∣fuse in his Expences upon me and rav∣ing if I ever appear'd what he call'd in∣different to his Favours Yet he had one of the best and one of the finest Women in the World for his Spouse and four as fine Children all which he despis'd for the empty Ostentation of being thought the Possessor of a Woman whom Hundreds had had before him You see Sir I'm as ingenuous as your Sister in my Account of myself I despis'd him in my Heart for the Grossness of his Taste in wasting Time Fortune and Reputation upon me who was unworthy to be Scullion to the Lady he abandon'd  However his Money was of Service to me and Women of the Town like any other Tradespeople are not to quar∣rel with their best Customers  I like a Frontier Town in Time of War often changed my Masters The next Person who own'd me was a Being whom I cou'd properly class under no  Character he call'd himself a Jemmy had a very fine Estate was very lavish of it in buying Nicknacks altering his Furniture Harness Post Charriots and Taverns Jaunting with me from Inn to Inn leaving me no other Socie∣ty than the Landlady or the melancho∣ly Amusement of looking thro' the Sashes at the Carriages and Travellers that came in and out of the Place where we happened to be He was always boast∣ing of the many fine Women he had enjoy'd nor wou'd he let a Lady of Quality escape him indeed he took Care where he told his Story It was only to the Landlord's Family who like other Dependants were obliged to be silent and seem to believe whatever their Pa∣tron was pleased to tell them For my Part I believe he was Innocency itself for in the six Months of our dawdling together I was a Westal to him he conversed with me as guiltless as my Bro∣ther But with his all Vanity and throw∣ing away his Money he never wou'd allow me Sixpence in my Pocket This I cou'd not bear and only staid with him till I cou'd fix upon a better Chap∣man  I was recommended to a Man of great Taste that was the Character giv∣en  me of him very rich but very ugly As to his Person Women of our Pro∣fession have no Business to mind Out∣sides Kept Mistresses have no more to do with real Love than Bailies have with Compassion I liv'd with him in much Splendor and great Uneasiness foolishly fond of me in Public and in private continually thwarting me  He was indeed as they said a Man of Taste but of a very odd one for as he confessed to me Enjoyment was almost insipid to him All his Pleasure was to be known to be well with some very celebrated Lady of Pleasure and has several Times declared to me that he wou'd not give Sixpence to lay with the most exquisite Beauty unless she was a noted Prostitute He was all for publick Opinion but that Opinion cou'd not make me doat upon him 'Tis true he was generous enough nay ra∣ther pressing me sometimes to take Mo∣ney for I am not the most mercenary of my Sex but I cou'd not like him and as he really said he proved too that Enjoyment was very insipid with him nay rather fatiguing and disgustful  Let those gentlemen who are pleased to make what Remarks they think fit on our Sex declare that a Woman's  Person is the best Part of the Pleasure if her Mind or Inclination is not at all concern'd in the Agreement the Gallant whatever he may fancy of the Feast has but an indifferent Share on it I cou'd not entirely divest myself while he liv'd of all Acquaintance with him for after we parted at all public Places he wou'd haunt me like my Shadow till I com∣promised Affairs with him He was to allow me five Guineas a Weak upon Condition I walk'd with him at  Ranelagh  wou'd let him drive me to  Epsom  Races call of him in a Chair three Mornings in the Week at the  Smyrna Slaughter  's and the  Bedford  Coffeehouses and once a Week in the Season sup with him in  Vauxhall  Gardens under the Orchestra while the Musick play'd  This Agreement I inform'd the Gen∣tleman of with whom I went next to live but he was too careless a Creature I found to concern himself about our Sex he told me that he kept me mere∣ly for an Amusement he lik'd my Fi∣gure and Conversation but all he did for me was to please himself that a Man of Sense cou'd not be jealous of a Woman of the Town as to my Time I was very welcome to do what I wou'd  with it when he did not want me pro∣vided I was careful of my Health  This strange Negligence of his made a deeper Impression on me than all the Assiduities I had receiv'd from others cou'd he now and then or wou'd he now and then have behav'd but commonly civil to me I shou'd have doated on him but he was quite a  Hottentot  he never had an amiable Moment There is a Time when Tenderness takes Place of Riot and even Savageness itself is softened but 'twas not so with him he was al Hurlyburly When I have artlessly indeed express'd myself fondly something like Love for a Minute steal∣ing over my Senses he has interrupted my Indulgence with pshah don't think to make a Fool of meHum Boys and old Men such as I am are not to be caught with Chaff  I quitted him for a famous Foxhunt∣er the finest Fellow in  England  so every body told me he was tho' a great Lump of Tobacco which swell'd out his lower Lip the first Time he saluted me gave me no great Opinion of his Delicacy However I accepted of him and my Acquaintance congratulated me upon my Luck in having so accom∣plished a Lover a Man of such fine  Sense such he might have I believe when sober and a great many other princely Qualities but I liv'd with him a Month and he was continually fuddled I part∣ed from himfearful of my Constitution  The next Day after I had left my last Lover I chanced to get acquainted with one who was really a clever Fellow but then he had not Sixpence that I did not then mind I had enough and I resolv'd since for some Time I had been a Slave to Man's various Inclinati∣ons I wou'd make one of that Sex sub∣ject to mine and after so much Labour resolv'd to have some Holidays  For the first three or four Days that I had this Genius with me he was the most entertaining Person I had ever kept Company with But he soon grew out of Temper he wanted to be in the wide World again not contented to be with me and have every Thing elegant about himnohe wanted a Ramble Regularity to him was a  Barbary  Slave∣ry I found him too witty to have any Sense There was no more fixing him than Smoke Yet I was so bigotted to him that I offer'd to sell my fine Fur∣niture retire into the Country marry him and live honest I shall never forget his Answer No Madam he  reply'd there's an Act of Parliament against Monopolies You belong to the Public and I have too great a Regard to my Country to pretend to keep that for my own Use which like the New River has and ought to serve half the Town Besides shou'd such a Thing happen I must banish myself from my own Sex's Society since I never cou'd meet too Acquaintance but I must be very certain one of them at least had lain with my Wife  I was mad with his Refusal yet I own I admired his Spirit We parted in a Pett and altho' we both I be∣lieve wish'd to come together again neither of us wou'd speak first I never after that had the least Affection for Mankind On the contrary they grew more and more disagreeable to me when a foolish Fellow of Fortune had me his Behaviour made me loath him when a jealous Man was my Master my Furniture was always in Danger A Sot impair'd my Health a Wit ru∣ined me a Gamester made a Slave of me young Fellows fretted me old Men fatigued me and with a marry'd Man I was in continual Alarms  I have in every Stage of Life found enough to make me miserable and  there is not any Set of Beings so contra∣dictorily titled as we are by those who call us Women of Pleasure like Sailors we get our Money in much Danger and throw it away on just the same Follies Dresses Midnight Riotings Hackney Horses and Spunging that is to say on gawdy Landladies  CHAP XXIV  THAT Evening  Tom Fool  told his Sifter the Resolution he had made to leave  England  but this Miss  Ninny  vehemently oppos'd desiring her Bro∣ther not to revenge himself upon him∣self that all Rashness was ridiculous Mrs  Veillied  observed that the World was at such a Pass at present that it was not worth any one's while to trouble their Heads about it  Borlace  swore that a Gentleman of Sense shou'd never let Passion get the better of his Reason and that we ought well to weigh the Con∣sequence of every Intention before we committed it to Practice  This Mr  Fool  promis'd to do and gave his Word and Honour that he wou'd not determine in a Hurry on what he had to do However he ob∣served as the next Day wou'd be  Sun∣day  and as he found himself so well heal'd he wou'd go to Church in the Morning to give Thanks for his Escape and Recovery  Mrs  Veilleid  Miss  Ninny  and  Bor∣lace  look's upon one another as if they said we fear the Gentleman's growing  light headed they wou'd not contra∣dict him for fear of making him worse seem'd to approve his Design but hinted it was Bedtime After they had seen Mr  Fool  to Bed they returned to hold a Consultation together they a∣greed  nem con  that his Senses were not perfectly sound and yet replied Mrs  Veilleid  you see not one Observation I made at Supper escaped him he has certainly a deal of Penetration And who cou'd behave better than he did replied Miss  Ninny  when he com∣mended me so for the manner in which I had related my Story Certainly says Mr  Borlace  Mr  Fool  is a very fine Man yet he is not the first Gentleman of extraordinary Sense whose Head has by Sickness been turn'd awry Besides consider he has only drank Water Tea and plain Gruel ever since he came his Blood must consequently be thin and poor and run cold and make him fan∣cy strange Megrims You see he began about Church we must not contradict him but let him go I hope it won't make him worse tho'  It was unanimously agreed that  Witwou'd  tho' it was Night shou'd have a Horse saddled immediately and set off to Mr  Fool  's House and let Lady  Fool  know where her Spouse was Miss  Ninny  wrote her Ladyship a Letter then the two Gentlewomen retired to rest and  Botlace  gallop'd away full of Spirits  Sunday Morning  Mr  Fool  went into the Church the instant the Doors were open'd he had therefore Time enough to walk about according to Custom and amuse himself by staring at one odd Thing or another as indeed there is in most Places of Wor∣ship As he sauntred about he might gaze at the Ceiling pore over the paint∣ed Glass or read the goldletter'd Ac∣count of the several celebrated Bene∣factors  Imprimis  How a Squire left forty Shillings  per Annum  for a yearly Sermon against Drunkenness to be preach'd on the Day the Mayor was chose  Item  That his Honour left thirtysix Shillings  per Annum  to the Ringers for a Peal to be rung on the first Day of  April  Item  How that the Lady of the Ma∣nor left fifty Pounds to new Fringe the Pulpit Cloth and line the Family Pew  Item  That the Reverend Vicar of the Church left two hundred Pounds to buy a new Set of chased Plate for the Communiontable and twenty Pounds for two Velvet Cushions with Gold Tassels  Item  The same Reverend Gentleman left twelve Shillings  per Annum  to be divided among twentyfour poor Housekeepers on  Christmasday  Item  Dame  Ursula  is Wife left ten Pounds  per Annum  for ever to new gild yearly the Iron Rails round her Tomb  There were several other Benefactions equally as devout essential and charita∣ble But Mr  Fool  took no Notice of any of these Things it was odd indeed but he did not so much as transcribe one Epitaph to communicate it to the Public for a Curiosity either for the Goodness of its Puns or the Badness of its Spelling  While he was at Church a religious Awe fill'd his Mind which made him solely intent upon the Business he came about  Oh resentful Reader whether you are a polite Person or a witty one despise not the Hero of this History for being so horridly out of Fashion as to be at  Church from a Principle of unfeign'd DevotionRemember he is but a Fool  Thou and I and the rest of the joyous Class of choice Spirits have too much Sense to suffer ourselves so to be impos'd upon  When Morningprayer was over for it was not this Parish's Turn to have a Sermon every  Sunday  altho' the Living was worth above a hundred Pounds  per Annum  and held in  Commendam  with three more Pluralities by the Reverend Mr **** Prebend of **** and Chap∣lain to **** yet the Incumbent was so frugal in Church Affairs that he hired a Cantab out of Preferment at ten Shil∣lings per Sabbath to do Duty for him at all his inferior Spiritualities so that the Deputy was oblig'd to hurry over the Job having no less than four more Churches to read Prayers and Sermons at that very Day  Tom Fool  chearfully walk'd through the Churchyard with a Mind fill'd with that heavenbestow'd Tranquility which always accompany true Devotion and as he look'd on the lovely Landscapes around him gratefully contemplated the Wonders of Creation  So much was he busied in Mediation he mistook his Road being a Stranger to the Country he walk'd until he came to four Roads then look'd round for the Church he came from and resolv'd to make up to it again thinking from hence he cou'd hit upon the right Path but like many wiser Men only took much Pains to be more out of the Way He grew tired and under a widebranching Oak in the midst of a smoothmown Grassplat he sat down The Fa∣tigue he had undergone made him drowzy and laying at his Length gave himself up to the gentle Indulgence of strengthrecruiting Sleep fast as the Aledrinking Alderman who snores in his Pew after Dinner during Sermontime  The Lady of the Manor had been walking that Afternoon with her Wo∣man along the Meadows her House was but two Fields off from the Spot where Mr  Fool  rested himself he cou'd not discover it because a thick Grove prevented on that Side a Footpassenger's View When she came to the Place where  Tom  lay she was surpriz'd her Maid was dismally frighten'd and wou'd have run Home to call for Help but she was order'd to stay Curiousity just  then giving the Lady a Twitch by the Sleeve observing the sleepy Person to be welldress'd she walk'd up gently towards him and began softly to praise his Figure  Indeed Mem as you say replied Mrs  Pinner  he is the most genteelest Man I have seen out of  London  and yet you may see Mem he as been walking a good way by the Dust upon his Shoes and Stockings and Mem what a white Hand he has too and  Dresden  Ruffles onAs sure as God made the World he's a Gentleman Mem and mayhap misfortuneable in Love for I thought as how he sigh'dPray Mem let me wake him for fear mayhap some Ver∣min should bite him  Her mistress was as willing as her Woman to know what cou'd bring a welldress'd agreeablelooking Man on Foot there took a Pinch of Snuff and lightly let it fall upon his upper Liphe sneez'dwak'dstarted up and be∣held the lovely Miss  Demirep  standing before him  Tom Fool  made an unaffected Apo∣logy for his being there hop'd he had committed no Trespass told the Lady he was a Stranger who had lost his Way and begg'd she wou'd permit  one of her Servants to set him into the right Road  Mr  Fool  's Countenance was open and florid the Tone of his Voice particularly sweet and plaintive his Eyes were not broadstretch'd into a rude Stare but he now and then lift them up while he was speaking and his Look was tender modest and sensible yet his whole Deportment seem'd to speak a Mind in Grief at least Miss  Demirep  thought so and the Appearance of Di∣stress is sure to waken a delicate Sympathy in female Minds which to the Shame of mighty Man be it know all our Reading cannot make us Masters of nor all our Writings properly describe  Upon Miss  Demirep  's Invitation  Tom Fool  attended her to the Hall where with a Grace peculiar to fine Women of Fashion she requested he wou'd let her know how she cou'd give her Leave to assure him that the Laws of Hospitality flourish'd under her RoofTo be sure it might seem oddbut as she was above Disguise herself flatter'd herself he was so tooPerhaps she might be wrongbut she fancied he had lost something more than his Way  Tom Fool  was not so eager to relate his Adventures as she was to hear them He told the Lady he was a Gentlemanhad been hurt by false Friendships and from thence took Occasion to de∣claim on the Falshoods of Mankind  Miss  Demirep  in whose Heart Com∣passion had a noble Dwellingplace view'd him with Pity but 'twas a Pity mix'd with Approbation She took Part in all he said look'd as he look'd sigh'd as he sigh'd his Mind she found was manly as his Person his Sentiments ge∣nerous and tender his Observations ju∣dicious yet without either Flattery or Rancour  Tom  who was amorous as  Ovid  sur∣vey'd with Attention the Brilliancy of the Lady's Figure and discover'd by con∣versing with her how elegant her Mind was enrich'd Thus by Degrees the Understanding the Accomplishments each discover'd in each rais'd a recipro∣cal Esteem pleas'd with the Entertain∣ment they sat up together till Morning and even then the Day wou'd have been unheeded by them tho' the Sun darted his Rays cross the Room had not Mrs  Pinner  ventured in to beg Leave to know when Mem wou'd please to have Breakfast  Next Day Mr  Fool  sent one of Miss  Demirep  's Servants to his Sister's to let her know where he was for  Tom  seem'd not in a hurry to quit his Quarters He and the lovely Miss  Demirep  soon con∣fess'd to each other the praiseworthy Opinions they had conceiv'd as none but noble Minds are capable of such un∣disguis'd Sentimentsso none but no∣ble Minds will believe this Passage but it was sothey own'd a mutualawhy shou'd we be asham'd to relate it This Performance is design'd to be a History of Nature of Nature actuated by honest InstinctTherefore with Submission to all abstracted Speculatists must acknowledge Mr  Fool  's lovely Hostess soon brought his own Lady in less guilty or to come nearer com∣mon Sense  Tom Fool  in the Arms of Miss  Demirep  found an universal Con∣solation  His Lady indeed met with a mo∣mentary one on the arrival of Mr  Bor∣lace  That Gentleman as we have be∣fore mentioned set out in the Night for  Foolhall  As soon as he had reach'd it and discover'd to Mrs  Susan  that he came from her Master and that Mr  Fool  was in Health and unhurt the whole House was overjoy'd and  Borlace  caress'd in a very extraordinary Manner as the Messenger of glad Ti∣dings  Lady  Fool  who had until that Time kept her Room and whose Health was visibly impaired order'd her Postcha∣riot to be got ready immediately and return with Mr  Borlace  to fling her∣self as she very afflictingly express'd herself at her dear Husband's Feet When she alighted at Mars  Veillied  's and miss'd of seeing her Spouse she was al∣most distracted with the Disappointment her Ladyship imagining Mr  Fool  shun'd her she return'd Home heavy at Heart altho' Miss  Ninny  whom she took with her us'd every Argument imaginable to comfort her  As soon as her Ladyship returned Home she sent for her Attorney for as there was most Part of the Estate vested in her so as she cou'd dispose of it with∣out her Husband's Consent yet she made a Will and left him whole and sole Executor And it must be allow'd she cou'd not be too careful in an Underta∣king of such Consequence for tho' the Law is the Grand Elixir for  England  's Constitution it is not amiss to be aware of Counterfeits  CHAP XXV  MR  Fool  had been at the amiable Miss  Demirep  's above a Week before he had Time to relate all his Ad∣ventures he had often begun and of∣ten had she interrupted him either by tenderly sympathising with his Distresses or bursting out into Praises of his Disin∣terestedness  At the Conclusion of his Story ea∣gerly pressing him to her Breast she sigh'd oh God what must that Wo∣man be who cou'd wrong you  At that Instant Mrs  Pinner  entering acquainted Mr  Fool  that there was a Man came on Horseback that had a Letter which he will deliver into no∣body's Hands but your Honour's And indeed Mem continued Mrs  Pin∣ner  addressing herself to Miss  Demirep  as soon as Mr  Fool  left the Room I believe as how it is from the Gentleman's House for the Man axt for his Master  Miss Demirep  Do you Mrs  Pinner  see that the Man is very well entertain'd but order all my Servants not to ask the Man any  Questions about the Family he lives in upon any Account  Mrs Pinner  No to be sure Mem  Exit Mrs Pinner  Now my Comates keen Tenants of the upper Story and Fellow Plagiarists here is the lovely Miss  Demirep  alone in a warm Room on a soft Settee her Senses all in a flutter  See how she looks Ay how That is the Question for to be free and faith∣ful to every good Reader we second∣hand Copyers are seldom admitted Tete a Tete into a Woman of Fashion's Re∣tiringroom we cannot therefore criti∣cally say how they look or what they converse about Yet as some Painters have copy'd  Madonas  from their Mis∣tresses we Journeymen Journalizers often avail ourselves of ourAcquain∣tance the Women of the Town and palm their Figures dress Bons mots and Behaviour upon the Injudicious for illus∣trious Originals  Let the Members of our penstump∣ing Society make as much Parade as they please about high Life and so forth we are as much unacquainted with it as we are with the Heathen  Gods and Goddesses that we jumble to∣gether in our jingling Invocations  Yet if any particular Reader as some Readers are very particular wou'd be inform'd what Colour Miss  Demirep  's Eyes were whether her Locks were fastened of fell loosely in flowing Curls upon her Shoulders whether she was in full Dress or in Dishabille if it was Coffee or Chocolate she had breakfasted upon how many shaking Mandarins nodded upon her Chimneypiece what sort of Paper the Room was lined with and how broad the  Turkey  Carpet was that covered the Flooring They shall be inform'd immediately Come Spirit of minute Description inspire meBut I am interrupted Mr  Fool  is returned with a Brace of Letters in his Hand he very gracefully presents them to Miss  Demirep  Reader we must be inform'd of the Contents one way or other every Body will satisfy their Curiosity The Lady has unfolded them I know it is not good Mannershowever we'll give a Peep over her Shoulder  LETTER the FIRST  Dear Brother  WE are all very much concern'd at your not coming back to Mrs  Weilleid  's that  Sunday  However we are all rejoiced to hear you are well I am at present along with your Spouse Lady  Fool  at your own House Your Lady is in a very declining Way she having had two Fits of Apoplexy and her Physicians de∣clare that if she has another she is a dead Woman Therefore I beg as soon as you have read the inclos'd you will set out which is all at pre∣sent from your loving Sister  N FOOL  P S Compliments to Miss  Demirep  LETTER the SECOND  Dear injur'd Husband  I Conjure you to be so merciful as to return to me if it be only to close the dying Eyes of your unhappy Wife who was betray'd intoxicated and undone by Villany  Yours till Death H FOOL  After Miss  Demirep  had read those Letters she return'd them to Mr  Fool  but her Hand she had not withdrawn from his In that Position for some Moments they stood silent tenderly looking at each other at length  Tom Fool  his Eyes glissening with Compassi∣on thus addressed her  Madam had not the Hospitality Miss  Demirep  has shown to a poor wandering Outcast bound him by the strictest Ties of Gratitude not to depart with∣out first at least acknowledging the Favours he had receiv'd I should not hesitate a Moment obeying the Purport of these Advices but circumstanced as I am 'tis to you and you only I ap∣ply for Advice What am I Madam to do  Miss Demirep  To goTo go this InstantI may be irregular but am not abandon'dI love mightly but not meanlyThere∣fore go this Instant go 'Tis not my Advice alone but my Intreaty go And may your Presence preserve your Lady's Health At the same Time she spoke this checking a swelling Sigh which Passion in Spite of Reason's Teeth was bursting out with Then  stepped forward to throw her Arms about his Neck and take a parting Em∣bracebut recollecting that her Ca∣resses might detain him some Minutes she check'd herself and broke from him sayingNo not a Kiss of mine shall stop you a Moment on a Event like thisAdieuAnd immedi∣ately rush'd up Stairs into her Dressingroom  Just as Mr  Fool  reach'd Home his Lady had another Fit and as the Fa∣culty had fortold lived but two Days after her Husband's Return leaving him in clear Possession of full two thousand Pounds  per Annum  and several Sums of ready Money  As soon as the Business of Burial was over Mr  Fool  sent for Mr  Borlace  and with an Ingenuousness peculiar to the nobleminded Part of Mankind told him  Mr  Borlace  Providence has been pleas'd to favour me with a large Inde∣pendency therefore I look upon it as my Duty to lay out the Superfluity of my Income in endeavouring to make those happy I think deserve it I will neither mantain Racehorses to enrich Grooms nor make sumptuous Enter∣tainments to cram Flatterers or let  my Servants learn the Way to ProfusionnoI am beholding to that Being to whom we all owe our Beings and how can I testify my Gratitude He stands not in Need of any Thing I have but I will endeavour to copy some small Part of his Goodness and be bountiful in my Turn for rich Men are or shou'd be God's Agents for him to the Poor  I am not now to be told the Disposi∣tion my Sister and you entertain for each otherbut her Husband is living as soon as I can legally procure a Divorce I will if I can make you happy together  As you left your Affairs in  London  in Disorder you will find in this Pocketbook a Sufficiency I believe to defray your Creditors Demands and this I wou'd have you do immediately set out for Town Tomorrow Morning You'll excuse me Mr  Borlace  but as you have seen and suffered so much you are suf∣ficiently wean'd from the Weakness of Indiscretions  Witwoud  wanted to throw himself at Mr  Fool  's Feet called him his Guardian Angel and by several desperate Oaths wou'd have given Bond for his good Be∣haviour but his Friend prevented him However nothing cou'd hinder  Borlace  from swearing he despised Debauchery  coursing the Madness of Riot and exe∣crating all the Folly of Extravagance and concluded with a very pathetic Ob∣servation concerning Misery and Con∣tempt  Thus is the Apothegm of  Aristotle  made out Man may know much of every Thing in the World except him∣self for as it was impossible for him to be in  London  with Money in his Poc∣ket and not be found out by his Friends so it was for him when found out to avoid keeping Company with them For that Man of Spirit wou'd be stig∣matiz'd with the odious Appellation of a damn'd sneaking Fellow  Borlace  therefore being a Man of Spirits will∣ing to convince his Friends whatever Alterations he had undergone were all for the better kept it up indeed was quite the Thing  ad unguem  As his Ho∣nour and Sir  Thomas  told him shaking him heartily by the Hand damn them if they wou'd not back him for a Thou∣sand and take him against the Field  As we have therefore brought him to  London  and left him in such good Com∣pany we must return to look after our other Passengers  It is Time to bring this Bundle of many Sections to a tolerable Conclusion  and we will immediately to it according to the present practis'd Rules of Me∣moirwriting We have taken them thro' Pages sufficient to swell this Work into two Volumes And now we have nothing to do but marry them off like  Fleet  Parsons we must be expeditious in our Vocation For we have many Sweethearts in Pairs who like Countrydancing Couples stand on Tiptoe to be at it  In a little Time after  Witwoud Bor∣lace  's Arrival in  London  Miss  Ninny  went up so see every Thing was in pro∣per Order in the late Lady  Fool  's Town∣house The Reader may easily guess who was shortly to be Mistress of it and as soon as Decency cou'd allow it Mr  Fool  paid Miss  Demirep  a Visit  Ye delicate Sensibilities whose Minds are untainted by the Insipidities of Fashi∣on's Multitude Ye who nobly relish Friendship's Feasts Fancies flow and every Beat of Heart distended Rapture form to yourselves the Meeting betwixt such a Pair as Mr  Fool  and the lovely Miss  Demirep  All was Embrace all was Rapture all was AdmirationWhen gently leading her to the lovereceiving Settee he thus addressed the allattentive Lady  Behold me now Madam possess'd of an unincumber'd Estate of upwards of two thousand Pounds a Year I know the Nobleness of your Disposition too well not to be conscious Wealth can't win you yet such is the Custom of the World I have no other way to show myself worthy of what I wish for Don't be offended Madam let me not by be∣ing too peremptory shock your Delica∣cy  Kneeling  Forgive me if I too much presumebut thus I offer you my Handto become your Husband is all that I wish for to compleat to fix me happy  The Lady was too much astonish'd to bid him rise a thousand Thoughts rush'd by Turns to her Mind for above a Mi∣nute she fat sat silent looking with Won∣der at him yet it was not an avaritious Hesitation whether she shou'd or shou'd not take his Offernoshe was charm'd amaz'denraptur'd with her Lover's Behaviour As soon as she found her∣self settled enough to reply this was her Answer  Thou Pattern of true PrincipleI may justly glory of possessing what few Ladies ever cou'd boast ofa real Lo∣ver But shall a Man show such Ho∣nour such Gratitude to one of our Sex  and shall not that one return itShe will tho' to that Honour she sacrifices HappinessI cannot Sir I must not go with you to the AltarI'mI'm unworthyI love you beyond Life I wou'd wander with you in Want and bear the World's Contempt to call you mine but my own Contempt I can't en∣dure Had I only trangress'd with you I cou'd have excus'd it nay vindicated it to myself but to deliver my Person to you in the sacred Tie of Wedlock when that Person has been the Property of others What Shall I demean the Man my Soul doats on Twou'd distract me to think for think I shou'd that any Man cou'd dare to say of one so worthy as youI have had his Wife  As your Mistress I'll be faithful but not dishonour you as heigh hoper∣haps I overstrain this Point Women like me think different from the rest of our Sex we are apt to refine too much or be too regardlessthis I feel now I have done Never before did I look upon what the World calls Innocence but as a Weakness of Understanding never cou'd I have thought such Anxiety wou'd arise in the Mind from only re∣flecting on lost ReputationDon't think the worse of me Sir for this Confession  no Lady ever gave up before me more than IohGodwhat shall I say I these are Selfdenials well may those Persons be proud who can put them in Practice  Tom Fool  But Madam are we to live for the World or ourselves  Miss  Hush for Heaven's Sake don't be your own Advocate against yourself It is a much as all my Resolution can do to keep the Field against Inclination and if you take its Part  Enter Mrs Pinner  Whose there  Mrs Pinner  Beg Pardon Membut your Com∣pany's come Mem and you always or∣der'd me to let you know to a Moment Mem  The abrupt Entrance of the Domestic made this Dialogue end very unsatisfac∣tory Mr  Fool  took a Turn upon the Terrace and Miss  Demirep  retired for a Moment into her Dressingroom to compose herself for the Reception of her Visitors  We shall name or announce them a better Phrase in the Manner they alighted  Imprimis  Madam  Vander Doit  for∣merly the fine  Batilda  for her  Dutch  Merchant had bought out Mr  Israel  's Property in her and by a Licence from  Doctor'sCommons  made her entirely his own  Secondly  Sir  Tasty  handing Lady  Pil∣low  Third Couple  Were young  Blood  who usher'd Sir  Tasty  's Lady whose Maiden Name was  Bonville  and as it is men∣tion'd in the former part of thi  e Regi∣ster the Baronet was about to make her a Settlementhe did sobut after some Time they parted  It was just before Lady  Grotto  and Sir  Tasty  came down into the Country and met  Junior  at the Inn as beforemen∣tion'd  When the Baronet and the Innkeep∣er's Wife were in  London  together Miss  Bonville  hearing that Sir  Tasty  had a new Mistress she threw herself in his Way in a very advantageous Situation appearing at  Ranelagh  three or four Times with a Star and Garter as her Attendant Squire and three or four more Men of Dignity crouding about her  Love like a Lease is often renewable and the Baronet thought her tentimes more handsome than ever begg'd Leave  to wait on her enquir'd her Address and all Lace and Feather next Day at Noontime he waited for her in her first Floor  She enter'd the Room stately as a Schoolmistress he rose to salute her she drew back and gave him a Look cold as a Creditor he was disconcerted his Face fell he saluted her Hand she begg'd he'd be seated The Baronet quite amaz'd bow'd squatted into a Chair stammer'd begg'd Pardon pull'd out his Snuffbox got up and sat down again then rose made a new Apology shut up his Snuffbox look'd thro' the Sash wonder'd and slid into his Chair again  Miss  Bonville  grave as a Lady Abbess at Vespers talk'd about Sin old Age Deathbeds and being virtuous Sir  Tasty  swore bit his Nails quoted Scraps of Plays Miss  Bonville  burst out into Tears  Sir Tasty  Madam by Heavens you are mad and have turn'd Methodist  Miss Bonville  No Sir you injure me but I have made a Vow and that Vow is register'd in Heaven never to hold Trust or Commerce more with Man until those  Dealings are sanctified by matrimonial Law  Sir Tasty  Do you expect that I shou'd marry you Child Something high that faith  Miss Bonville  No Sir  Tasty  but there is a Silkmercer in  Fleetstreet  to whom I have given my Consent  Sir Tasty  The Devil you have so my tow hun∣dred Pounds a Year is to furnish out a Cit's Shop with Silks and Sattins is itNoDamme thennot to be humm'd in that manner neitherI've a Scheme to stop that  This Scheme he put in Execution the Week followingit was only marrying the Lady himself and that was saving his two hundred Pounds a Year her Ladyship became in an Instant a Pattern of ReformationSo Chaste that at the very Mention of a kept Mistress she lifts up her Hands and Eyes and wonders how there can be such Women  Just as they were seated Mr  Fool  ent  'd his being in Mourning made him look more agreeable The Assem∣bly  m'd to be surprised Madam  Van∣der  t  in a Whisper congratulated  Dem  rep  Lady  Tasty  stared Lady  Pil∣low  sigh'd young  Blood  swore he thought he knew the Gentleman Sir  Tasty  de∣clared he shou'd be loth to give Of∣fence but pon his onner he cou'd be al∣most tempted to back his Opinion two Faces might be a like to be surebut he cou'd like to have five hundred on't Miss  Demirep  to cure him of Suspence I won't say she had any secret Satisfac∣tion in it undertook to be Lady Usher and introduc'd the young Widower by Name to all the good Company  Mr  Fool  the next Day received a Let∣ter from  Borlace  that his Presence was very necessary just then in  London  for the late Lady  Fool  had large Concerns in the  WestIndies  left her by her first Hus∣band which indeed she had never much minded therefore  Witwoud  in his Ad∣vice to Mr  Fool  desired him to come up immediately observing that Money∣matters in some of our Colonies are not transacted by Agents with that Perspi∣cuity as we cou'd wish  His amiable Hostess did not indeed press him to put off his Journey she fear'd Lady  Pillow  who she observ'd had an unusual softness in her Eyes just at this Time and was for ever looking at  Tom Fool  his Heart Miss  Demirep  had prov'd was all Tenderness there∣fore  she was alarm'd least he might be inclined to Pity at least and she knew by her own Disposition wherever Pity was taken in for a Tenant Love soon came to be a Lodger there  Soon after  Tom Fool  and Miss  Demirep  having handsomely acquitted herself of her visitants stepp'd into her Postchaise for her  London  Journey How often upon the Road did she rail at Tyrantcustom then curse our boasting Sex then blame herself for her own Delicacy  On the other Side how wou'd she sometimes congratulate herself upon her Resignation her Resolution her Mar∣tyrdom as she term'd it  He must love me for it I'm con∣scious he must thus she pleased herself with reflecting he does he will tho' I shall not have him for a Husband yet  as  a Husband he's mine he will be mine mine and only minebut all is not Gold that looks soevery Reck∣oning is not always rightHowever we will so far reckon right as here to finish the Chapter and the next we begin with Joy the Editor declares it to be  CHAP XXVI  WHEN  Tom Fool  came to  London  he found  Borlace  had made a very had Use of the Sum he had been in∣trusted with  Witwoud  also had been rather too premature in communicating to his Companions the History of his good Fortune with Mr  Fool  nay to his very great Intimates he whisper'd that he had had Miss  Fool  and hinted some∣thing about patching up Reputations and that Matrimony's Pill shou'd be well sweetned  Curse on that Flippancy of Tongue Why will you ye maudlin Declaimers why will ye form such midnight Friend∣ships Ye Mementos of Indiscretion who persist spite of Shame or Sufferings like venombreathing Serpents do discharge Infection from your Mouths  Miss  Ninny  had not conducted herself with the utmost Circumspection during her Abode in  London  Her Behaviour at public Places prejudic'd the grave Part of the World from entertaining a good Opinion either of her Morals or Understanding It is not worth while to describe her Dress or her Manner at  public Places We see many fine Ladies whose Actions and Appearance seem to say like the Founder of the Feast when Dinner's upon the Table Come Gentle∣men won't ye please to fall to  Her Brother very mildly expostulated with her and mention'd the Word De∣cency She replied Stuff but she spoke that Word aside to herself He obeserv'd to her that no Person shou'd incur if they cou'd help it the World's CensuresThat she took very ill did not Answer him indeed but begg'd Leave to retire and ready to burst with Vexation hurried into her own Apart∣ment flung herself into an arm'd Chair and with Tears told her Woman as the Maid held out the Lavender Drops to her  Hannah  my Brother is become a perfect Tyrant  that  Miss  Demirep  has set him against me  But to  Witwoud Borlace Tom Fool  was more severe He reprov'd him very sharply nay was almost angry with him for so ridiculously squandring away a Sum of Money which as Mr  Fool  told him was the Property of his Cre∣ditors  Witwoud  who not only had a great Share of Spirits but had also a great  Spirit cou'd ill brook to be told of his Faults by one much younger than him∣self and who had not seen half so much of the World neitherHe was mad in his Mindbut had Cunning enough to conceal it  He told  Tom Fool  a long Story how he was made drunk he cou'd not tell how and then indeed he did he cou'd not tell what that he had a great many Enemies and that they had rais'd a Parcel for Reports out of Envy against him that for his Part he was fuddled at first by the only Method that cou'd have made him so which was drinking Bumpers to Mr  Fool  's HealthHow∣ever he wou'd not drink any more for he saw now it was a Plant against him to get me Sir out of your Favour for I'll be doubly damn'd before I'd give so good a Man as you a Offence  But this Concession only lasted before  Tom Fool  for the Moment he left the Parlour he flew to Miss  Ninny  and af∣ter giving Vent to halfadozen full∣mouth'd Oaths he declar'd her Brother to be a meanspirited Fellow What's his Money to me Or where wou'd he have had any Money if it had not been for meDamn it is such a Man as  I am to be school'd as if I was sent like a Servant to Market and so must give an
