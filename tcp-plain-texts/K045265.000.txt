 THE STATUES OR THE TRIAL of CONSTANCY A TALE FOR THE LADIES  LONDON  Printed for T COOPER at the  Globe  in  PaterNosterRow  M DCC XXXIX  THE STATUES OR THE TRIAL of CONSTANCY▪  _IN a fair island in the southern main  Blest with indulgent skys and kindly rain  A Princess liv'd of origin divine  Of bloom coelestial and imperial line  IN that sweet season when the mounting Sun  Prepares with joy his radiant course to run  Led by the Graces and the dancing Hours  And wakes to life the various race of flow'rs  The lovely Queen forsook her shining court  For rural scenes and healthful Sylvan sport  IT so befel that as in chearful talk  Her Nymphs and She purfu'd their ev'ning walk  On the green margin of the oozy deep  They found a graceful Youth dissolv'd in sleep  His charms the Queen survey'd with fond delight  And hung enamour'd o'er the pleasing sight  By her command the youth was strait convey'd  And sleeping softly in her palace laid  NOW ruddy morning purpled o'er the skies  And beamy light unseal'd the stranger's eyes  Who cry'd aloud Ye Gods unfold this Scene  Where am I what can all these wonders mean  SCARCE had he spoke when with officious care  Attendant nymphs a fragrant bath prepare  He rose he bath'd and on his lovely head  Ambrosial sweets and precious oyl they shed  To deck his polish'd limbs a robe they brought  In all the various dies of beauty wrought  Then led him to the Queen who on a throne  Of burnish'd gold and beamy diamonds shone  But O what wonder selz'd her beauteous guest  What love what extasy his soul possest  Entranc'd he stood and on his falt'ring tongue  Imperfect words and half form'd accents hung▪  Nor less the Queen the blooming youth admir'd  Nor less delight and love her soul inspir'd  O Stranger said the Queen if hither driv'n  By adverse winds or sent a guest from Heav'n  To me the wretched never sue in vain  This fruitful isle with joy approves my reign  Then speak thy wishes and thy wants declare  And no denial shall attend thy pray'r  She paus'd and blush'd the youth his silence broke  And kneeling thus the charming Queen bespoke  O GODDESS for a form so bright as thine  Speaks thee descended of coelestial line▪  Low at your feet a prostrate King behold  Whose faithless subjects sold his life for gold  I fly a cruel tyrant's lawless hand  And storms have drove my vessel on your strand  But why do I complain of Fortune's frowns  Or what are titles honours sceptres crowns  To this sweet moment whilst in fond amaze  On such transporting excellence I gaze  Such symetry of shape so fair a face  Such finish'd elegance such perfect grace  Hear then my only wish and O approve  The ardent pray'r which supplicates thy love  From  Neptune  know O Prince my birth I claim  Replies the Queen and  Lucida  's my name  This island these attendant nymphs he gave  The fairhair'd daughters of the azure wave  But he whose fortune gains me for a bride  Must have his constancy severely try'd  One day each moon am I compell'd to go  To my Great Father's wat'ry realms below  Where coral groves coelestial red display  And blazing di'monds emulate the day  In this short absence if your love endures  My heart and empire are for ever your's  And hoary  Neptune  to reward your truth  Shall crown you with immortal bloom and youth  But instant death will on your falshood wait  Nor can my tenderness prevent your fate  Twice twenty times in wedlock's sacred band  My Royal Father join'd my plighted hand  Twice twenty noble youths alas are dead  Who in my absence stain'd the nuptial bed  Your virtues Prince may claim a nobler throne  But mine is yielded on these terms alone  Delightful terms reply'd the raptur'd youth  Accept my constancy my endless truth  Perfidious faithless men enrag'd he cry'd  They merited the fate by which they dy'd  Accept a heart incapable of change  Thy beauty shall forbid desire to range  No other form shall to my eye seem fair  No other voice attract my list'ning ear  No charms but thine shall e'er my soul approve  So aid thy vot'ry potent God of love  NOW loud applauses thro' the palace ring  The duteous subjects hail their Godlike King  To feastful mirth they dedicate the day  Whilst tuneful voices chant the nuptial lay  Lovedittiedairs hymn'd by the vocal quire  Sweetly attemper'd to the warbling wire  But when the Sun descending sought the main  And lowbrow'd night assum'd her silent reign  They to the marriagebed convey'd the Bride  And laid the raptur'd Bridegroom by her side  Now rose the morn and with auspicious ray  Dispell'd the dewy mists and gave the day  When  Lucida  with anxious cares opprest  Thus wak'd her sleeping lord from downy rest  Soul of my soul and monarch of my heart  This day she cry'd this fatal day we part  Yet if your love uninjur'd you retain  We soon shall meet in happiness again  To part no more but rolling years employ  In circling bliss and neverfading joy  Alas my boding soul is lost in woe  And from my eyes the tears unbidden flow  JOY of my life dismiss those needless fears  Reply'd the King and stay those precious tears  Shou'd lovely  Venus  leave her native sky  And at my feet imploring fondness lie  Ev'n she the radiant Queen of soft desires  Shou'd disappointed burn with hopeless fires  THE heart of Man the Queen's experience knew  Perjur'd and false yet wish'd to find him true  She sigh'd retiring and in regal state  The King conducts her to the palace gate  Where sacred  Neptune's  chrystal chariot stands  The wond'rous work of his coelestial hands  Six harness'd swans the bright machine convey  Swift thro' the air or pathless wat'ry way  The birds with eaglespeed the air divide  And plunge the goddess in the sounding tide  SLOW to the court the pensive King returns  And sighs in secret and in silence mourns  So in the grove sad Philomel complains  In mournful accents and melodious strains  Her plaintive woes fill the resounding lawn  From starryvesper to the rosy dawn  THE King to mitigate his tender pain  Seeks the apartment of the virgin train  With sportive mirth sad absence to beguile  And bid the melancholly moments smile  But there deserted lonely rooms he found  And solitary silence reign'd around  He call'd aloud when lo a hag appears  Bending beneath deformity and years  Who said My Liege explain your sacred will  With joy your sovereign purpose I fulfil  My will detested wretch avoid my sight  And hide that hideous shape in endless night  What does thy Queen o'errun with rude distrust  Resolve by force to keep a husband just  YOU wrong reply'd the hag your royal wife  Whose care is love and love to guard your life  The race of mortals are by nature frail  And strong temptations with the best prevail  Be that my care he said be thine to send  The virgin train let them my will attend  THE Beldam fled the chearful Nymphs advance  And tread to measur'd airs the mazy dance  The raptur'd Prince with greedy eye surveys  The bloomy maids and covets still to gaze  No more recals the image of his spouse  How false is Man nor recollects his vows  With wild inconstancy for all he burns  And ev'ry Nymph subdues his soul by turns  At length a maid superior to the rest  Array'd in smiles in virgin beauty drest  Receiv'd his passion and return'd his love  And softly woo'd him to the silent grove  ENCLOS'D in deepest shade of fullgrown wood  Within the grove a spacious grotto stood  Where forty youths in marble seem'd to mourn  Each youth reclining on a fun'ral urn  Thither the Nymph directs the Monarch's way  He treads her footsteps joyful to obey  There fir'd with passion clasp'd her to his breast  And thus the transport of his soul exprest  DELIGHTFUL beauty deck'd with ev'ry charm  High fancy paints or glowing love can form  I sigh I gaze I tremble I adore  Such lovely looks ne'er blest my eyes before  Here under covert of th' embow'ring shade  For Love's delights and tender transports made  No busy eye our raptures to detect  No envious tongue to censure or direct  Here yield to Love and tenderly employ  The silent season in extatick joy  WITH arms enclasp'd his treasure to retain  He sigh'd and strove but strove and sigh'd in vain  She rush'd indignant from his fond embrace  Whilst rage with blushes paints her virgin face  Yet still he sues with suppliant hands and eyes  Whilst she to magick charms for vengeance flies  A LIMPID fountain murmur'd thro' the cave  She fill'd her palm with the translucent wave  And sprinkling cry'd Receive false man in time▪  The just reward of thy detested crime  THY changeful sex in perfidy delight  Despise perfection and fair virtue slight  False fickle base tyrannick and unkind  Whose hearts nor vows can chain nor honour bind  Mad to possess by passion blindly led  And then as mad to stain the nuptial bed  Whose roving souls no excellence no age  No form no rank no beauty can engage  Slaves to the bad to the deserving worst  Sick of your twentieth love as of your first  These STATUES which this hallow'd grot adorn  Like thee were Lovers and like thee forsworn  Whose faithless hearts no kindness cou'd secure  Nor for a day preserve their passion pure  Whom neither love nor beauty cou'd restrain  Nor fear of endless infamy and pain  Now feel the force of heav'ns avenging hand  And here inanimate for ever stand  SHE spokeamaz'd the list'ning monarch stood  And icy horror froze his ebbing blood  Thick shades of death upon his eyelids creep  And clos'd them fast in everlasting sleep  No sense of life no motion he retains  But fix'd a dreadful monument remains  A STATUE now and if reviv'd once more  Wou'd prove no doubt as CONSTANT as before▪  FINIS
