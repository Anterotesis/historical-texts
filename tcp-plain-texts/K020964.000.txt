at the RoyalExchange J GARDINER in CharlesStreet Westminster and J ALMON in Piccadilly MDCCLXIV  THE DUELLIST BOOK I  THE Clock struck twelve o'er half the globe  Darkness had spread her pitchy robe  MORPHEUS his feet with velvet shod  Treading as if in fear he trod  Gentle as dews at Eventide  Distill'd his poppies far and wide  AMBITION who when waking dreams  Of mighty but phantastic schemes  Who when asleep ne'er knows that rest  With which the humbler soul is blest  Was building castles in the air  Goodly to look upon and fair  But on a bad foundation laid  Doom'd at return of Morn to fade  Pale  STUDY by the taper's light  Wearing away the watch of night  Sat reading but with o'ercharg'd head  Remember'd nothing that he read  Starving 'midst plenty with a face  Which might the Court of Famine grace  Ragged and filthy to behold  Grey  AV'RICE nodded o'er his gold  JEALOUSY his quick eye halfclos'd  With watchings worn reluctant doz'd  And mean distrust not quite forgot  Slumber'd as if he slumber'd not  Stretch'd at his length on the bare ground  His hardy offspring sleeping round  Snor'd  restless  LABOUR by his side  Lay Health a coarse but comely Bride  VIRTUE without the Doctor's aid  In the soft arms of sleep was laid  Whilst VICE within the guilty breast  Could not be physic'd into rest  Thou Bloody Man  whose russian knife  Is drawn against thy neighbour's life  And never scruples to descend  Into the bosom of a friend  A firm fast friend by vice allied  And to thy  secret  service tied  In whom ten Murders breed no awe  If properly secur'd from law  Thou Man of Lust  whom passion fires  To soulest deeds whose hot desires  O'er honest bars with ease make way  Whilst  Ideot  Beauty falls a prey  And to indulge thy brutal flame  A LUCRECE must be brought to shame  Who dost a brave bold Sinner bear  Rank incest to the open air  And rapes fullblown upon thy crown  Enough to weigh a nation down  Thou Simular of Lust  vain man  Whose restless thoughts still form the plan  Of guilt which wither'd to the root  Thy lifeless nerves can't execute  Whilst in thy marrowless dry bones  Desire without Enjoyment groans  Thou Perjur'd Wretch  whom Falshood cloaths  E'en like a garment who with oaths  Dost trifle as with brokers meant  To serve thy ev'ry vile intent  In the Day's broad and searching eye  Making God witness to a lye  Blaspheming Heav'n and Earth for pelf  And hanging  friends  to save thyself  Thou Son of Chance  whose glorious soul  On the four aces doom'd to roll  Was never yet with Honour caught  Nor on poor Virtue lost one thought  Who dost thy  Wife  thy  Children  set  Thy  All  upon a single bet  Risquing the desp'rate stake to try  Here  and  Hereafter  on a die  Who thy own private fortune lost  Dost game on at thy Country's cost  And grown expert in Sharping rules  First fool'd thyself now prey'st on fools  Thou Noble Gamester  whose high place  Gives too much credit to disgrace  Who with the motion of a die  Dost make a mighty Island fly  The Sums I mean of good  French  gold  For which a mighty Island sold  Who dost  betray intelligence    Abuse the  dearest confidence    And private fortune to create  Most falsely play the game of State  Who dost within the  Alley  sport  Sums which might beggar a whole Court  And make us Bankrupts all if CARE  With good  Earl  TALBOT was not there  Thou daring Infidel  whom pride  And Sin have drawn from Reason's side  Who fearing his avengeful rod  Dost wish not to believe a God  Whose Hope is founded on a plan  Which should distract the soul of man  And make him curse his abject birth  Whose Hope is once return'd to earth  There to lie down for worms a feast  To rot and perish like a Beast  Who dost of punishment afraid  And by thy crimes a Coward made  To ev'ry gen'rous soul a Curse  Than Hell and all her torments worse  When crawling to thy latter end  Call on destruction as a friend  Chusing to crumble into dust  Rather than rise tho' rise You must  Thou Hypocrite  who dost prophane  And take the Patriot's name in vain  Then most thy Country's foe when most  Of Love and Loyalty You boast  Who for the filthy love of Gold  Thy Friend thy King thy God hast sold  And mocking the just claim of Hell  Were bidders found thyself would'st sell  Ye Villains  of whatever name  Whatever rank to whom the claim  Of Hell is certain on whose lids  That worm which never dies forbids  Sweet Sleep to fall  Come  and  Behold    Whilst Envy makes your blood run Cold  Behold  by pitiless Conscience led  So JUSTICE wills that holy bed  Where PEACE her full dominion keeps  And INNOCENCE with HOLLAND sleeps  Bid Terror posting on the wind  Affray the spirits of mankind  Bid Earthquakes heaving for a vent  Rive their concealing continent  And forcing an untimely birth  Thro' the vast bowels of the earth  Endeavour in her monstrous womb  At once all Nature to entomb  Bid all that's horrible and dire  All that man hates and fears conspire  To make night hideous as they can  Still is thy sleep Thou Virtuous Man  Pure as the thoughts which in thy breast  Inhabit and ensure thy rest  Still shall thy AYLIFF taught tho' late  Thy friendly justice in his fate  Turn'd to a guardian Angel spread  Sweet dreams of comfort round thy head  Dark was the Night by fate decreed  For the contrivance of a deed  More black than common which might make  This land from her foundations shake  Might tear up Freedom by the root  Destroy a WILKES and fix a BUTE  Deep Horror held her wide domain  The sky in sullen drops of rain  Forewept the morn and thro' the air  Which op'ning laid his bosom bare  Loud Thunders roll'd and Lightning stream'd  The Owl at Freedom's window scream'd  The ScreechOwl prophet dire whose breath  Brings sickness and whose note is death  The ChurchYard teem'd and from the tomb  All Sad and Silent thro' the gloom  The Ghosts of Men in former times  Whose Public Virtues were their crimes  Indignant stalk'd Sorrow and Rage  Blank'd their pale cheek in his own age  The prop of Freedom HAMPDEN there  Felt after death the gen'rous care  SIDNEY by grief from Heav'n was kept  And for his brother Patriot wept  All Friends of LIBERTY when Fate  Prepar'd to shorten WILKES's date  Heav'd deeply hurt the heartfelt groan  And knew that wound to be their own  Hail LIBERTY a glorious word  In other countries scarcely heard  Or heard but as a thing of course  Without or Energy or Force  Here  felt enjoy'd ador'd she springs  Far far beyond the reach of Kings  Fresh blooming from our Mother Earth  With Pride and Joy she owns her birth  Deriv'd from us and in return  Bids in our breasts her Genius burn  Bids us with all those blessings live  Which LIBERTY alone can give  Or nobly with that Spirit die  Which makes Death more than Victory  Hail those Old Patriots on whose tongue  Persuasion in the Senate hung  Whilst They this sacred Cause maintain'd  Hail those Old Chiefs to Honour train'd  Who spread when other methods fail'd  War's bloody banner and prevail'd  Shall Men like these unmention'd sleep  Promiscuous with the common heap  And Gratitude forbid the crime  Be carried down the stream of time  In Shoals unnotic'd and forgot  On LETHE's stream like flags to rot  No they shall live and each fair name  Recorded in the book of fame  Founded on Honour's basis fast  As the round Earth to ages last  Some Virtues vanish with our breath  Virtue like this lives after death  Old Time himself his scythe thrown by  Himself lost in Eternity  An everlasting crown shall twine  To make a WILKES and SIDNEY join  But should some slavegot Villain dare  Chains for his Country to prepare  And by his birth to slav'ry broke  Make her too feel the galling yoke  May he be evermore accurs'd  Amongst bad men be rank'd the worst  May he be still Himself and still  Go on in Vice and perfect Ill  May his broad crimes each day increase  Till he can't Live nor Die in Peace  May he be plung'd so deep in shame  That S may'nt endure his name  And hear scarce crawling on the earth  His children curse him for their birth  May LIBERTY beyond the grave  Ordain him to be still a slave  Grant him what here he most requires  And damn him with his own desires  But should some Villain in support  And zeal for a despairing Court  Placing in Craft his confidence  And making Honour a pretence  To do a deed of deepest shame  Whilst filthy lucre is his aim  Should such a Wretch with sword or knife  Contrive to practice 'gainst the life  Of One who honour'd thro' the land  For Freedom made a glorious stand  Whose chief perhaps his only crime  Is if plain Truth at such a time  May dare her sentiments to tell  That He his Country loves too well  May Hebut words are all too weak  The feelings of my heart to speak  May HeO for a noble curse  Which might his very marrow pierce  The general contempt engage  And be the MARTIN of his age  END OF THE FIRST BOOK  THE DUELLIST BOOK II  DEEP in the bosom of a wood  Out of the road a Temple stood  Antient and much the worse for wear  It call'd aloud for quick repair  And tottering from side to side  Menac'd destruction far and wide  Nor able seem'd unless made stronger  To hold out four or five years longer  Four hundred pillars from the ground  Rising in order  most  unsound  Some rotten to the heart aloof  Seem'd to support the tott'ring roof  But to inspection nearer laid  Instead of giving wanted aid  The Structure rare and curious made  By Men most famous in their trade  A work of years Admir'd by all  Was suffer'd into dust to fall  Or just to make it hang together  And keep off the effects of weather  Was patch'd and patch'd from time to time  By wretches whom it were a crime  A crime which Art would treason hold  To mention with those names of old  Builders who had the pile survey'd  And those not Flitcrofts in their trade  Doubted the wise hand in a doubt  Merely sometimes to hand his out  Whether like Churches in a brief  Taught wisely to obtain relief  Thro' Chancery who gives her fees  To this and other Charities  It must not in all parts unsound  Be ripp'd and pull'd down to the ground  Whether tho' afterages ne'er  Shall raise a building to compare  Art if they should their Art employ  Meant to preserve might not destroy  As human Bodies worn away  Batter'd and hasting to decay  Bidding the pow'r of Art despair  Cannot those very medicines bear  Which and which only can restore  And make them healthy as before  To LIBERTY whose gracious smile  Shed peace and plenty o'er the Isle  Our grateful Ancestors her plain  But faithful Children rais'd this fane  Full in the Front stretch'd out in length  Where Nature put forth all her strength  In Spring Eternal lay a plain  Where our brave Fathers us'd to train  Their Sons to Arms to teach the Art  Of War and steel the infant heart  LABOUR their hardy Nurse when young  Their joints had knit their nerves had strung  ABSTINENCE foe declar'd to death  Had from the time they first drew breath  The best of Doctors with plain food  Kept pure the channel of their blood  in their cheeks bad colour rise  And GLORY sparkled in their eyes  The instruments of Husbandry  As in contempt were all thrown by  And flattering a manly pride  War's keener tools their place supplied  Their arrows to the head they drew  S  w if  to the point their javelins flew  They grasp'd the sword They shook the spear  Their Fathers felt a pleasing fear  And even COURAGE standing by  he hold with  eye  Each Stripling lesson'd by his Sire  Knew when to close when to retire  When near at hand when from afar  To fight and was Himself a War  Their Wives their Mothers all around  Careless of order on the ground  Breath'd forth to Heav'n the pious vow  And for a Son's or Husband's brow  With eager fingers Laurel wove  Laurel which in the sacred grove  Planted by Liberty they find  The brows of Conquerors to bind  To give them Pride and Spirits fit  To make a world in arms submit  What raptures did the bosom fire  Of the young rugged peasant Sire  When from the toil of mimic fight  Returning with return of Night  He saw his babe resign the breast  And smiling stroke those arms in jest  With which hereafter he shall make  The proudest heart in GALLIA quake  Gods with what joy what honest pride  Did each fond wishing rustic Bride  Behold her manly swain return  How did her lovesick bosom burn  Tho' on Parades he was not bred  Nor wore the livery of red  When Pleasure height'ning all her charms  She strain'd her Warrior in her arms  And begg'd whilst Love and Glory fire  A Son a Son just like his Sire  Such were the Men in former times  Ere Luxury had made our crimes  Our bitter Punishment who bore  Their terrors to a foreign shore  Such were the men who free from dread  By EDWARDS and by HENRIES led  Spread like a torrent swell'd with rains  O'er haughty Gallia's trembling plains  Such were the Men when lust of Pow'r  To work him woe in evil hour  Debauch'd the Tyrant from those ways  On which a King should found his praise  When stern OPPRESSION hand in hand  With PRIDE stalk'd proudly thro' the land  When weeping JUSTICE was misled  From her fair course and MERCY dead  Such were the Men in Virtue strong  Who dar'd not see their Country's wrong  Who left the mattock and the spade  And in the robes of War array'd  In their rough arms departing took  Their helpless babes and with a look  Stern and determin'd swore to see  Those babes no more or see them free  Such were the Men whom Tyrant Pride  Could never fasten to his side  By threats or bribes who Freemen born  Chains tho' of gold beheld with scorn  Who free from ev'ry servile awe  Could never be divorc'd from Law  From that broad gen'ral Law which Sense  Made for the general defence  Could never yield to partial ties  Which from dependant stations rise  Could never be to Slav'ry led  For  Property  was at their head  Such were the Men in days of yore  Who call'd by Liberty before  Her Temple on the sacred green  In Martial pastimes oft were seen  Now seen no longer in their stead  To laziness and vermin bred  A Race who strangers to the cause  Of Freedom live by other laws  In other motives fight a prey  To interest and slaves for pay  VALOUR how glorious on a plan  Of Honour founded leads their Van  DISCRETION free from taint of fear  Cool but resolv'd brings up their rear  DISCRETION VALOUR's better half  DEPENDANCE holds the Gen'ral's Staff  In plain and homespun garb array'd  Not for vain shew but service made  In a green flourishing old age  Not damn'd yet with an Equipage  In rules of  Porterage  untaught  SIMPLICITY not worth a groat  For years had kept the Temple door  Full on his breast a glass he wore  Thro' which his bosom open lay  To ev'ry one who pass'd that way  Now turn'd adriftwith humbler face  But prouder heart his vacant place  CORRUPTION fills and bears the key  No entrance now without a fee  With belly round and full fat face  Which on the house reflected grace  Full of good fare and honest glee  The  Steward  HOSPITALITY  Old  WELCOME smiling by his side  A good old Servant often tried  And faithful found who kept in view  His Lady's fame and int'rest too  Who made each heart with joy rebound  Yet never run her State aground  Was turn'd off or which word I find  Is more in modern use  resign'd    Halfstarv'd halfstarving others bred  In beggary with carrion fed  Detested and detesting all  Made up of Avarice and Gall  Boasting great thrift yet wasting more  Than ever Steward did before  Succeeded One who to engage  The praise of an exhausted age  Assum'd a name of high degree  And call'd himself OECONOMY  Within the Temple full in sight  Where without ceasing day and night  The Workmen toil'd where LABOUR bar'd  Her brawny arm where ART prepar'd  In regular and even rows  Her types a  PrintingPress  arose  Each Workman knew his task and each  Was honest and expert as LEACH  Hence  LEARNING struck a deeper root  And SCIENCE brought forth riper fruit  Hence  LOYALTY receiv'd support  Even when banish'd from the Court  Hence  GOVERNMENT was strength and  hence  RELIGION sought and found defence  Hence ENGLAND's fairest fame arose  And LIBERTY subdued her foes  On a low simple turfmade throne  Rais'd by  Allegiance  scarcely known  From her Attendants glad to be  Pattern of that Equality  She wish'd to all so far as cou'd  Safely consist with social good  The GODDESS sat around her head  A chearful radiance GLORY spread  COURAGE a Youth of royal race  Lovelily stern possess'd a place  On her lefthand and on her right  Sat HONOUR cloath'd with robes of Light  Before Her MAGNA CHARTA lay  Which some great Lawyer of his day  The PRATT was offic'd to explain  And make the basis of her reign  PEACE crown'd with Olive to her breast  Two smiling twinborn infants prest  At her feet Couching War was laid  And with a brindled Lion play'd  JUSTICE and MERCY hand in hand  Joint Guardians of the happy land  Together held their mighty charge  And TRUTH walk'd all about at large  HEALTH for the royal troop the feast  Prepar'd and VIRTUE was High Priest  Such was the fame our  Goddess  bore  Her Temple such in days of yore  What changes ruthless Time presents  Behold her ruin'd battlements  Her walls decay'd her nodding spires  Her altars broke her dying fires  Her name despis'd her Priests destroy'd  Her friends disgrac'd her foes employ'd  Herself  by  Ministerial  arts  Depriv'd e'en of the people's hearts  Whilst They to work her surer woe  Feign her to Monarchy a foe  Exil'd by grief selfdoom'd to dwell  With some poor Hermit in a cell  Or that retirement tedious grown  If She walks forth She walks  unknown    Hooted and pointed at with scorn  As One in some strange Country born  Behold a rude and russian race  A band of spoilers seize her place  With looks which might the heart disseat  And make like sound a quick retreat  To rapine from the cradle bred  A  Staunch Old Bloodhound  at their head  Who free from Virtue and from Awe  Knew none but the bad part of Law  They rov'd at large each on his breast  Mark'd with a  Greyhound  stood confest  CONTROULMENT waited on their nod  Highwielding Persecution's rod  CONFUSION follow'd at their heels  And a  cast Statesman  held the Seals  Those Seals for which he dear shall pay  When awful JUSTICE takes her day  The Printers sawthey saw and fled  SCIENCE declining hung her head  PROPERTY in despair appear'd  And for herself destruction fear'd  Whilst underfoot the rude slaves trod  The works of men and word of God  Whilst close behind on many a book  In which he never deigns to look  Which he did not naycould not read  A  bold bad  man by pow'r decreed  For that bad end who in the dark  Scorn'd to do mischief set his mark  In the full day the mark of Hell  And on the Gospel stamp'd an L  LIBERTY fled her Friends withdrew  Her Friends a faithful chosen few  HONOUR in grief threw up and SHAME  Cloathing herself with HONOUR's name  Usurp'd his station on the throne  Which LIBERTY once call'd her own  Gods that such mighty ills should spring  Under so great so good a King  So Lov'd so Loving thro' the arts  Of Statesmen curs'd with wicked hearts  For ev'ry darker purpose sit  Behold in triumph STATECRAET sit  END OF THE SECOND BOOK  THE DUELLIST BOOK III  AH Me what mighty perils wait  The Man who meddles with a State  Whether to strengthen or oppose  False are his friends and firm his foes  How must his Soul once ventur'd in  Plunge blindly on from sin to sin  What toils he suffers what disgrace  To get and then to keep a place  How often whether wrong or right  Must he in jest or earnest fight  Risquing for those both life and limb  Who would not risque one groat for him  Under the Temple lay a Cave  Made by some guilty coward slave  Whose actions fear'd rebuke a maze  Of intricate and winding ways  Not to be found without a clue  One Passage only known to few  In paths direct led to a Cell  Where FRAUD in secret lov'd to dwell  With all her tools and slaves about her  Nor fear'd lest Honesty should rout her  In a dark corner shunning sight  Of Man and shrinking from the light  One dull dim taper thro' the Cell  Glimm'ring to make more horrible  The face of darkness She prepares  Working unseen all kinds of snares  With curious but destructive art  Here  thro' the eye to catch the heart  Gay stars their tinsel beams afford  Neat artifice to trap a Lord  There  fit for all whom Folly bred  Wave plumes of feathers for the head  Garters  the Hag contrives to make  Which as it seems a babe might break  But which ambitious Madmen feel  More firm and sure than chains of steel  Which slipp'd just underneath the knee  Forbid a Freeman to be free  Purses  She knew did ever curse  Travel more sure than in a purse  Which by some strange and magic bands  Enslave the soul and tye the hands  Here  FLATT'RY eldest born of guile  Weaves with rare skill the silken smile  The courtly cringe the supple bow  The private squeeze the Levee vow  With which no strange or recent case  Fools  in  deceive Fools  out  of place  CORRUPTION who in former times  Thro' fear or shame conceal'd her crimes  And what She did contriv'd to do it  So that the Public might not view it  Presumptuous grown unfit was held  For their dark councils and expell'd  Since in the day her business might  Be done as safe as in the night  Her eye downbending to the ground  Planning some dark and deadly wound  Holding a dagger on which stood  All fresh and reeking drops of blood  Bearing a lanthorn which of yore  By TREASON borrow'd GUY FAWKES bore  By which since they improv'd in trade  Excisemen  have their lanthorns made  ASSASSINATION her whole mind  Bloodthirsting on her arm reclin'd  Death grinning at her elbow stood  And held forth instruments of blood  Vile instruments which cowards chuse  But Men of Honour dare not use  Around his Lordship and his Grace  Both qualified for such a place  With many a FORBES and many a DUN  Each a resolv'd and pious Son  Wait her high bidding Each prepar'd  As She around her orders shar'd  Proof 'gainst remorse to run to fly  And bid the destin'd victim die  Posting on Villainy's black wing  Whether He Patriot is or King  OPPRESSION willing to appear  An object of our love not fear  Or at the most a rev'rend awe  To breed usurp'd the garb of LAW  A Book she held on which her eyes  Were deeply fix'd whence seem'd to rise  Joy in her breast a Book of might  Most wonderful which black to white  Could turn and without help of laws  Could make the worse the better cause  She read by flatt'ring hopes deceiv'd  She wish'd and what She wish'd believ'd  To make that Book for ever stand  The rule of wrong through all the land  On the back fair and worthy note  At large was MAGNA CHARTA wrote  But turn your eye within and read  A bitter lesson N's CREED  Ready e'en with a look to run  Fast as the coursers of the Sun  To worry Virtue at her hand  Two halfstarv'd Greyhounds took their stand  A curious model cut in wood  Of a most antient Castle stood  Full in her view the gates were barr'd  And Soldiers on the watch kept guard  In the Front openly in Black  Was wrote The TOW'R but on the back  Mark'd with a Secretary's seal  In bloody Letters The BASTILE  Around a Table fully bent  On mischief of most black intent  Deeply determin'd that their reign  Might longer last to work the bane  Of one firm Patriot whose heart tied  To Honour all their pow'r defied  And brought those actions into light  They wish'd to have conceal'd in Night  Begot Born Bred to infamy  A PrivyCouncil sat of THREE  Great were their names of high repute  And favour thro' the land of BUTE  The FIRST entitled to the place  Of Honour both by Gown and Grace  Who never let occasion slip  To take righthand of fellowship  And was so proud that should he meet  The twelve Apostles in the street  He'd turn his nose up at them all  And shove his Saviour from the wall  Who was so mean Meanness and Pride  Still go together side by side  That he would cringe and creep be civil  And hold a stirrup for the Devil  If in a journey to his mind  He'd let him mount and ride behind  Who basely fawn'd thro' all his life  For  Patrons  first then for a  Wife    Wrote  Dedications  which must make  The heart of ev'ry Christian quake  Made one Man equal to or more  Than God then left him as before  His God he left and drawn by Pride  Shifted about to t'other side  Was by his sire a Parson made  Merely to give the Boy a trade  But he himself was thereto drawn  By some faint omens of the Lawn  And on the truly Christian plan  To make himself a Gentleman  A title in which form array'd him  Tho' Fate ne'er thought on't when She made him  The Oaths he took 'tis very true  But took them as all wise men do  With an intent if things should turn  Rather to temporize than burn  Gospel and Loyalty were made  To serve the purposes of trade  Religion's are but paper ties  Which bind the fool but which the wise  Such idle notions far above  Draw on and off just like a glove  All Gods all Kings let his great aim  Be answer'd were to him the same  A Curate first he read and read  And laid in whilst he should have fed  The souls of his neglected flock  Of reading such a mighty stock  That he o'ercharg'd the weary brain  With more than She could well contain  More than She was with Spirits fraught  To turn and methodize to thought  And which like illdigested food  To humours turn'd and not to blood  Brought up to London from the plow  And Pulpit how to make a bow  He try'd to learn he grew polite  And was the Poet's Parasite  With Wits conversing and Wits then  Were to be found 'mongst Noblemen  He caught or would have caught the flame  And would be nothing or the same  He drank with drunkards liv'd with Sinners  Herded with Infidels for dinners  With such an Emphasis and Grace  Blasphem'd that POTTER kept not pace  He in the highest reign of noon  Bawl'd bawdry songs to a Psalm Tune  Liv'd with Men infamous and vile  Truck'd his salvation for a smile  To catch their humour caught their plan  And laugh'd at God to laugh with Man  Prais'd them when living in each breath  And damn'd their mem'ries after death  To prove his Faith which all admit  Is at least equal to his Wit  And make himself a Man of note  He in defence of Scripture wrote  So long he wrote and long about it  That e'en Believers 'gan to doubt it  He wrote too of the inward light  Tho' no one knew how he came by't  And of that influencing grace  Which in his life ne'er found a place  He wrote too of the Holy Ghost  Of whom no more than of a Post  He knew nor should an Angel shew him  Would He or know or chuse to know him  Next for he knew 'twixt ev'ry Science  There was a natural alliance  He wrote t'advance his Maker's praise  Comments on rhimes and notes on plays  And with an allsufficient air  Plac'd himself in the Critic's chair  Usurp'd o'er Reason full dominion  And govern'd merely by opinion  At length dethron'd and kept in awe  By one plain simple Man of Law  He arm'd dead Friends to Vengeance true  T'abuse the Man they never knew  Examine strictly all mankind  Most Characters are mix'd we find  And Vice and Virtue take their turn  In the same breast to beat and burn  Our Priest was an exception here  Nor did one spark of grace appear  Not one dull dim spark in his soul  Vice glorious Vice possess'd the whole  And in her service truly warm  He was in sin most uniform  Injurious  Satire  own at least  One sniveling Virtue in the Priest  One sniveling Virtue which is plac'd  They say in or about the waist  Call'd CHASTITY the Prudish Dame  Knows it at large by Virtue's name  To this his Wife and in these days  Wives seldom without reason praise  Bears evidencethen calls her child  And swears that TOM was vastly wild  Ripen'd by a long course of years  He great and perfect now appears  In Shape scarce of the human kind  A Man without a manly mind  No Husband tho' he's truly wed  Tho' on his knees a child is bred  No Father injur'd without end  A Foe and tho' oblig'd no Friend  A Heart which Virtue ne'er disgrac'd  A Head where Learning runs to waste  A Gentleman wellbred if breeding  Rests in the article of reading  A Man of this World for the next  Was ne'er included in his text  A Judge of Genius tho' confest  With not one spark of Genius blest  Amongst the first of Critics plac'd  Tho' free from ev'ry taint of Taste  A Christian without faith or works  As he would be a Turk 'mongst Turks  A great Divine as Lords agree  Without the least Divinity  To crown all in declining age  Enflam'd with Church and Partyrage  Behold him full and perfect quite  A false Saint and true Hypocrite  Next sat a  Lawyer  often tried  In perilous extremes when pride  And Pow'r all wild and trembling stood  Nor dar'd to tempt the raging flood  This bold bad Man arose to view  And gave his hand to help them through  Steel'd 'gainst Compassion as they past  He saw poor Freedom breathe her last  He saw her struggle heard her groan  He saw her helpless and alone  Whelm'd in that storm which fear'd and prais'd  By slaves less bold himself had rais'd  Bred to the Law he from the first  Of all bad Lawyers was the worst  Perfection for bad men maintain  In ill we may perfection gain  In others is a work of time  And they creep on from crime to crime  He for a Prodigy design'd  To spread amazement o'er mankind  Started fullripen'd all at once  A Perfect Knave and Perfect Dunce  Who will for him may boast of Sense  His better guard is Impudence  His front with tenfold plates of brass  Secur'd SHAME never yet could pass  Nor on the surface of his skin  Blush for that guilt which dwelt within  How often in contempt of Laws  To sound the bottom of a cause  To search out ev'ry rotten part  And worm into its very heart  Hath he ta'en briefs on false pretence  And undertaken the defence  Of trusting Fools whom in the end  He meant to ruin not defend  How often e'en in open Court  Hath the wretch made his shame his sport  And laugh'd off with a Villain's ease  Throwing up briefs and keeping fees  Such things as tho' to roguery bred  Had struck a little Villain dead  Causes whatever their import  He undertakes to serve a Court  For He by heart this rule had got  Pow'r can effect what Law cannot  Fools He forgives but rogues he fears  If Genius yok'd with Worth appears  His weak soul sickens at the sight  And strives to plunge them down in night  So loud he talks so very loud  He is an Angel with the crowd  Whilst he makes Justice hang her head  And Judges turn from pale to red  Bid all that Nature on a plan  Most intimate makes near to Man  All that with grand and gen'ral ties  Binds good and bad the Fool and Wise  Knock at his heart They knock in vain  No entrance there such Suitors gain  Bid kneeling Kings forsake the throne  Bid at his feet his Country groan  Bid Liberty stretch out her hands  Religion plead her stronger bands  Bid Parents Children Wife and Friends  If they come thwart his private ends  Unmov'd he hears the gen'ral call  And bravely tramples on them all  Who will for him may cant and whine  And let weak Conscience with her line  Chalk out their ways such starving rules  Are only fit for coward fools  Fellows who credit what Priests tell  And tremble at the thoughts of Hell  His Spirit dares contend with Grace  And meets Damnation face to face  Such was our  Lawyer  by his side  In all bad qualities allied  In all bad Counsels sat a  Third    By birth a Lord O sacred word  O word most sacred whence Men get  A Privilege to run in debt  Whence They at large exemption claim  From Satire and her servant Shame  Whence They depriv'd of all her force  Forbid bold Truth to hold her course  Consult his person dress and air  He seems which strangers well might swear  The Master or by  Courtesy    The Captain of a Colliery  Look at his visage and agree  Halfhang'd he seems just from the Tree  Escap'd a Rope may sometimes break  Or Men be cut down by mistake  He hath not Virtue in the school  Of Vice bred up to live by rule  Nor hath he Sense which none can doubt  Who know the Man to live without  His life is a continued scene  Of all that's infamous and mean  He knows not change unless grown nice  And delicate from vice to vice  Nature design'd him in a rage  To be the WHARTON of his age  But having given all the Sin  Forgot to put the Virtues in  To run a horse to make a match  To revel deep to roar a catch  To knock a tott'ring watchman down  To sweat a woman of the Town  By fits to keep the Peace or break it  In turn to give a Pox or take it  He is in faith most excellent  And in the Word's most full intent  A true Choice Spirit we admit  With Wits a Fool with Fools a Wit  Hear him but talk and You would swear  OBSCENITY herself was there  And that PROPHANENESS had made choice  By way of Trump to use his Voice  That in all mean and low things great  He had been bred at  Bilingsgate    And that ascending to the earth  Before the Season of his birth  BLASPHEMY making way and room  Had mark'd him in his Mother's womb  Too honest for the worst of men  In forms are honest now and then  Not to have in the usual way  His Bills sent in Too great to pay  Too proud to speak to if he meets  The honest Tradesman whom he cheats  Too infamous to have a friend  Too bad for bad men to commend  Or Good to name beneath whose weight  Earth groans who hath been spar'd by Fate  Only to shew on Mercy's plan  How far and long God bears with Man  Such were the THREE who mocking sleep  At Midnight sat in Counsel deep  Plotting destruction 'gainst a head  Whose Wisdom could not be misled  Plotting destruction 'gainst a heart  Which ne'er from Honour would depart  "Is He not rank'd amongst our foes  "Hath not his Spirit dar'd oppose  "Our dearest measures made our name  "Stand forward on the roll of shame  "Hath he not won the vulgar tribes  "By scorning menaces and bribes  "And proving that his darling cause  "Is of their Liberties and Laws  "To stand the Champion in a word  "Nor need one argument be heard  "Beyond this to awake our zeal  "To quicken our resolves and steel  "Our steady souls to bloody bent  "Sure ruin to each dear intent  "Each flatt'ring hope He without fear  "Hath dar'd to make the  Truth  appear  They said and by resentment taught  Each on revenge employ'd his thought  Each bent on mischief rack'd his brain  To her full stretch but rack'd in vain  Scheme after Scheme they brought to view  All were examin'd none would do  When FRAUD with pleasure in her face  Forth issued from her hiding place  And at the table where they meet  First having blest them took her seat  "No trifling cause my darling Boys  "Your present thoughts and cares employs  "No common snare no random blow  "Can work the bane of such a Foe  "By Nature Cautious as he's Brave  "To  Honour  only he's a slave  "In that weak part without defence  "We must to  Honour  make pretence  "That Lure shall to his ruin draw  "The Wretch who stands secure in Law  "Nor think that I have idly plann'd  "This fullripe scheme behold at hand  "With three months training on his head  "An Instrument whom I have bred  "Born of these bowels far from sight  "Of Virtue's false but glaring Light  "My Youngest Born my dearest Joy  "Most like myself my darling Boy  "He never touch'd with vile remorse  "Resolv'd and crafty in his course  "Shall work our ends complete our schemes  "Most  Mine  when most He  Honour  's seems  "Nor can be sound at home abroad  "So firm and full a slave of FRAUD"  She said and from each envious Son  A discontented Murmur ran  Around the Table All in place  Thought his full praise their own disgrace  Wond'ring what Stranger She had got  Who had one vice that they had not  When strait the portals open flew  And clad in armour to their view  M the  Duellist  came forth  All knew and all confest his worth  All justified with smiles array'd  The happy choice their Dam had made  THE END
