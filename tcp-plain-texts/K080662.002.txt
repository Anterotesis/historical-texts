hatched run together like chickens  The old birds shew a remarkable solicitude for their young flying with great anxiety about them if disturbed and using every stratagem to decoy the disturber from the nest feigning to flutter as if wounded on the ground at a little distance or running along as if lame should those artifices prove useless they become desperate and will strike at the person or animal whom they cannot entice away  Towards winter both young and old assemble in flocks of four or five hundered on the heaths or marshy places at which time they are caught in nets for the use of

has described it as a British species nor has the latter included it in the Appendix of the British Zoology among the foreign birds which visit us at unstated periods  It is met with in many parts of  France  particularly in  Normandy  and the intermediate country between that and  Sweden  writers concur that it is of a very solitary disposition never mixing with other birds nor in numbers even with its own species it is chiefly found among the evergreen trees in the deep and gloomy recesses of extensive fo∣rests and is therefore little known even in those parts where the spe∣cies is most

should con∣sider the Tawny and Mountain Buntings with their varieties as the Snow Bunting in its different approaches to its summer appearance  Pennant is of a different opinion and has described it under the English name Tawny Bunting as a distinct species Latham has also described it as a different species in his general Synopsis and in the list of the Birds of Great Britain in the supplemental volume he adds "EMBERIZA FRIGIDA" and refers to the description of the Tawny Bunting in the British Zoology N  o    The name "Emberiza glacialis" has been also given to the same or a mere variety of

precisely corresponds with the description of the Honey Buzzard in  Latham  's General Synopsis of Birds but differs very materially from that either of Linnaeus  Linnaeus  describes the tail with only one cinerous band the tip white  Brisson  Brisson  says "the side tailfeathers are banded with white on the inner webs and are spotted with brown"  Pennant  Albin  describes the tail of his specimen "plain without bars"  or Albin  Pennant  in the Br Zool describes the Honey Buzzard "Chin breast and belly white the two last marked with dusky spots pointing downwards and three dusky bars on the tail" He mentions a variety "entirely of a deep brown had much the fame marks on the wings and tail as the male and the head tinged with ashcolour"    Albin  says "This bird builds its nest of small twigs laying on them wool and upon the wool its eggs Some of them have been found to  make use of an old nest of a kite to breed in feeding their young with the  nymphae of wasps  the combs of wasps being found in the aforesaid nests in which were two young ones covered with a white down spotted with black their feet of a pale yellow their bills between the nostrils and the head white their

ferruginous blotches of chesnut  Mr Latham  says he was informed by  Mr Boys  "that they are of a blueish white marked with irregular rufous spots the shape of the egg almost globular usually three in the nest"  Mr Pennant  says he was favoured with a description of the eggs by  Mr Plumly  "they were blotched over with two reds something darker than those of the Kestril"  PLATE XXXI LANIUS COLLURIO

more commonly in  April  it has been emphatically called the harbinger of Summer or the messenger of Spring and its note when heard early in the year should never fail to invite the rural oeconomist to his useful occupation With  Stillingfleet  and  Pennant  we acknowledge the fallibility of human Calendars for the purposes of husbandry and with them must conclude that "some attention should be given to those feathered guides who come heaventaught and point out the true commencement of the season their food being the Insects of those seasons they continue with us  Br Zool  "  The Cuckow is so well known in this and every other country of  Europe  that we are not surprised to find its Natural History has engaged the particular attention of every writer on Ornithology in whose works it could be introduced with propriety it may hence be difficult if not impossible to treat of its peculiar habits with an elegance of language superior to the description of  Buffon  to select more judiciously the beautiful fictions of Antient Bards than has been done by  Pennant  and other preceding writers who have thus embellished its history or to add to general information any material circumstance that has evaded the vigilance and accuracy of  Latham  The note of this bird is a call to love and is peculiar to the male who perched on the branch of a tree or the summit of an eminence thus invites the female from the coppice in which she sits in silence in a calm evening his note may be heard among the trees far off and when disappointed of its mate the neighbouring woods reecho his hollow note at the distance of a quarter of a mile  All Authors have allowed that the Cuckow does not hatch its own eggs but deposits them in the nest of some other bird generally in that of a HedgeSparrow WaterWagtail or a YellowHammer some Writers say the Cuckow lays only one egg others two  The egg figured by  Sepp  is like the Jackdaw's both in size and shape of a greenish white speckled with brown  Latham  says it is certainly not that of the Cuckow which he describes not much bigger than that of the HedgeSparrow greatly elongated in shape the ground colour not unlike it and mottled all over with ferruginous purple  in the nest the fosterparent attends them with the same care as her own and when the brood is hatched she shews no dislike to the spurious offspring she treats them with equal tenderness and toils with the same assiduity to supply them with food the young Cuckow when fledged follows its little instructor for a short time but as its appetite encreases and the small Insects it collects in imitation of its supposed parent soon become insufficient for its subsistence they sepa∣rate Its ingratitude is proverbial among the  French  "Ingrat comme un Coucou"  from a ridi∣culous supposition that it changed into a Hawk and devoured its nurse  About the end of  June  the call of the male ceases though it does not take its final departure till the end of  September  or beginning of  October Latham  observes he has heard it call at midnight more than once or twice in the course of the Summer and adds it was bright moonlight every time  They feed on

long protruding far beyond the  sternum  that part being so very short as not to be sufficient to take off the pressure in incubation whereby digestion may be impeded This has been assigned as the reason why it does not hatch its own eggs  Length of the adult bird is fourteen inches breadth twentyfive inches weight two ounces and an half  PLATE XLII CHARADRIUS MORINELLUS DOTTEREL GRALLAE  Bill

the remains of one by the side of a pond after having probably beaten off its first possessor  The forked tail of the Kite distinguishes it from every other bird and serves to direct its flight with
