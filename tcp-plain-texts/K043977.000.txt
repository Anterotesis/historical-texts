MDCCLI  TO THE READER  THE following lines were lately wrote in a fit of illness without any in∣tention of ever troubling the public with them but some very incorrect copies having been dis∣pers'd  unknown to the author occasion'd this edition  The writer has look'd on lif  too long and suffer'd too much in it to be anxious for the even of these rhymes they were wrote neither for profit nor re∣putation if he gets either by them its more than he expected or if he offends its what h  never design'd  Bath  Feb  RELIGION A RHAPSODY  BRIGHT emanation of all right'ous power  Religion bear me to thy sacred bower  Where fix'd in faith by holy patience bless'd  Calm resignation yields the wretched rest  Where hope divine to penitence is given  Beams in each breast and lists the soul to heaven  I  sons of shew ye unreflecting gay  Timetrifling youth the splendors of a day  Who lightly bounding o'er life's surface skim  Monarchs of mode and worshippers of whim  Thus thro' the air the wingpoiz'd warbler sings  Wanton thus flies display their painted wings  So struts the fowl with eyebespangled train  Like  you  self pleas'd as pretty and as vain  The time must come when dress and dancing's o'er  And your frail forms can play the fool no more  E'er 'tis too late look with religious eyes  Think think ye faulty and be timely wise  Ye  tender lovely loveinspiring race  Whose words are music and whose motion grace  Whose soft endearing looks insidious play  Feast the fond eye and snatch the soul away  Ye laughing sex who vainly wanton rove  Thro' the Elysium of unbounded love  Tho' round enamour'd crouds observant sigh  Watch the soft smile and catch the glancing eye  Still must you lose this senseensnaring form  And what now  eeds your lover feast a worm  Yet yet ye conscious beautybeaming train  A moment think then if ye darebe vain  Dispassion'd race  ye wealthy slaves of care  Whose cheeks ne'er felt the trickling tender tear  Whose breasts ne'er heav'd with sympathetic sigh  Whose hearts ne'er open'd to the asking eye  Ye sons of trade  ye busy tasteless train  Whose God is gold and whose religion gain  Your greedy minds to social joys unknown  In one dull drudging round rowl restless on  Can you expect a charity from Heav'n  Shall you ye stubborn hearted be forgiv'n  Fruitless your sighs repentant will appear  You'll want that mercy you derided here  Unmov'd the Godhead will your sorrows view  As weeping want on earth was seen by you  Starlustred breasts ye courtdelectant race  Ye souls of honour and ye sons of place  Big with each blessing that attends a throne  On the low wealthless look contemptuous down  Yet spite of pride the statesman and the slave  Rise undistinguish'd from the equal grave  Go search within for all ennobled earth  Go teach the tombbred worm respect to birth  Correct his feeding and refine his taste  Alas  Courtiers and clowns compose alike his feast  What will avail the di'monds sparkling blaz  The glare of titles or the vulgar's gaze  When wornout nature panting gasps for breath  And friends fly frighted from the face of dea  "To the sad sense what then can give content"  "The sweet reflection of a life well spent"  Calm each great soul quits his claycumb'rous  Springs to the skies and humbly waits his Go  While the low wretch by crime rais'd wealthg  great  Starts at life's loss and frightful meets his  Wideop'ning wild he rowls his ghastful eyes  He shakes he shrinks and agonizing cries  "Have mercy Heav'nCan I its mercy share  "See griefstab'd merit opes its bosom there  "Hear from the grave the plaintive orphan's groan  "Bursts sorrowing forth and strikes the heav'nly "throne  "Hark the lustruin'd fair extends her cries  "And the sound shakes along the trembling skies"  What shall we say in that great day of dread  When the rent graves shall render back their dead  When at the trumpet's sound the clouds give way  And the world blazes in eternal day  There the fierce tyrant feels th' avenging rod  And pride sinks trembling at the sight of God  There suff'ring virtue happiness receives  There the fool'd atheist tho' too late believes  The poor lost sinner hears th' eternal doom  And woe appall'd clings shudd'ring to his tomb  Bring ye bright fair your loveattending crow  Command your slain ye heroes from their shro  Ye prime in state display your deepest schemes  And ye nice wits your fancyforming dreams  Try try ye proud in that tremendous hour  The skill of science or the strength of pow'r  Selfpleasing wisdom the renown of birth  All all the vis'onary joys of earth  Lay them before the universal Lord  Go plead your merits and revoke his word  Sooner shall shadows stop the light'ning's blaze  Or gloworms dim the sun's refulgent rays  But chiefly you to whom the word was giv'n  Soulsaving sect ye delegates of Heav'n  Whose pious toils dispel the sinner's fear  Stop the throb'd sigh and dry confession's fear  Thus but unpension'd th' apostles went  On foot coarse clad with homely fare content  Declar'd the dictates of th' almighty Lord  But prov'd no doctrine by the dint of sword  Love justice faith humility they press'd  Yet threaten'd no damnation to the rest  Plain and unsully'd like the simple maid  Religion bloom'd by int'rest unallay'd  Leal truly servent penitence sincere  Bill'd the wrap'd soul and spoke the heartselt pray'r  Then social bliss descended from above  pread thro' each sex and ripen'd into love  o feign'd desires fed th' heavenly flame  ure blaz'd the passion as from God it came  ll beings then with mutual rapture strove  ove was religion and religion love  Ye motley sons compos'd of noise and she  Ye beautyhaunting gingling glitt'ring crew  Tho' round the fair you ever fondly rove  Think not insipids you were form'd for    Scorn worldly wealth ye pray'rdeliv'ring  Heav'n equal hearsequal dispenses place  With soulfelt awe adore all nature's Lord  Boldly proclaim his wonderworking word  Snatch the smooth mask from the rich  face  Check the gay vicious in their guilty race  Humble the haughty bend the scoffer dow  And scourge the shameless tho' the pow'r  ul  Raise tho' in rags and lend the wretched  Assist the friendless and protect the  Bounteous o'er earth the sun bestows his rays  Shines o'er a throne and thro' the cottage plays  Bounteous thus Heav'n the gospellight has spread  Pure you receive return it unallay'd  Shun the mean wrangling syllogistic rules  Scorn quibbling logic and the modes of schools  Free from dull learned jargon plainly preach  And act with ardour up to what you teach  Ye congregated lay who duly creep  As the bell tolls for churchto fall asleep  Ye welldress'd train who modishly resort  And treat the temple as you use the court  Ye senseless rude who with affrontive stare  Blush the meek beauty in her hour of pray'r  Ye empty idlings who insipid smile  Prettily pacing thro' the sounding isle  Devotion's hour loit'ring laugh away  Too nice to kneel and much too proud to pray  No more ye vain the sacred dome debase  Wanton with worship and your God disgrace  With me fall prostratepenitent adore  Confess your errors and offend no more  By chance condemn'd to wander from my birth  An erring exile o'er the face of earth  Wild thro' the world of vicelicentious  ace▪  I've started folly and enjoy'd the chace  Pleas'd with each passion I pursu'd their aim  Cheer'd the gay pack and grasp'd th  game  Revell'd regardless leap'd reflection o'er  'Till youth 'till health fame fortune are no more  Too late I feel the thoughtcorroding pain  Of sharp remembrance and severe disdain  Each painted pleasure its avenger breeds  Sorrow's sad train to riot's troop succeeds  Slow wasting sickness steals on swift debauch  Contempt on pride pale wants on waste approach  Scorn'd by the sad the cynie and the dull  The wou'dbe wit and milky minded fool  Eternal Good from Thee our hope descends  With Thee it centers and in Thee it ends  To Thee with shametorn heart I trembling kneel  Heal me with mercy oh my Saviour heal  Great Lord of life if daring I request  Still let me sigh among mankind unbless'd  Still sickness shipwrecks prisons plagues to kno  Whate'er my fate isstill my faith's in you  Still shall thy name attune thy suppliant's song  Still shall thy praise dwell rapt'rous on his tongue  Wretched or bless'd still shall I always own  Whate'er I feel Heav'n's holy will be done  FINIS
