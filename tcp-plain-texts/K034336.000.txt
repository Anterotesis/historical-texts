window  SERENADE  THOU restless God that lov'st to hold  Thy vigils where Zelida dwells  With peaceful sleep the fair enfold  From starts and tremors charms and spells  From goblin guard her elf and sprite  Which prying haunt defenceless night  With eye too free and hand too bold  Oh happy happy let her dream  Of some most sweet celestial theme  While Sylphs glide smiling by and starry meteors gleam  With music charm her ravish'd ears  Such and so heav'nly as the spheres  Of old to wond'ring sages play'd  These varied joys oh love decree  Worthy her and worthy thee  To nightly sooth th' angelic maid  The Musicians retire and  Jaquelina  enters from the street door  Jaq  Well this is charming This serenading and these raptures and loveI do believe all the young Dons in Madrid are dying for my mistressSuch sweet music and every night and all night long the sameone goes to  ep so happy and has such delightful dreams  Enter  Fabio  on the opposite side  Fab  Ah my sweet and gentle chambermaid Of all persons in the world you are the very person I was the most desirous to see  Jaq  Why then my most spruce and politic servingman you have only to open your eyesAnd having seen pray what is the nature of your very pressing business  Fub  An embassy of high import I am Love's plenipo Here is a letter from my master to your mistress I don't know the contents but I am sure they must be delicious Are not you of my opinion  Gives her the letter in one hand and money in the other  Jab  Hum partly  Fab  Oh Don Fernando writes in a very masterly stile on these occasions  Jaq  Pretty well pretty well but do you know that I was myself coming in search of that sweet face of your's  Fab  Indeed and what say you to my face  Jaq  Hum I cannot say much in its praise  Fab  Nor  much  in its dispraise I flatter myself  Jaq  You do indeedbut go run away with your face as fast you can and tell your master Don Fernando to wheedle his father into a good humour and bring him here as quick as possible for that our old Don is at present disposed to treat with him concerning this said marriage of their children  Fab  rubbing his hands and exceedingly pleased  Is he  Jaq  He is a good deal alarmed at our nightly concerts and wishes to see Zelida safely married  Fab  Good  Jaq  Overtures have been made by Don Velasco in behalf of his son Don Fabricio but in consideration of my mistress's preference of your master of his father's great wealth and of the still greater pains I have taken to persuade him in favor of Don Fernando why  Fab  We shall carry the day hey  Jaq  PerhapsYou know the grudge these two tetchy old fathers bear one anotherthey are for ever disputing fonder of their opinions than they are of their children and your master has no occasion to be told how necessary caution and expedition will be in this business  Fab  My dear delicate little dormouse your voice is sweeter than the nightingale's and your words more reviving than cherrybrandy This intelligence will be worth a quarter's wages to me at least but you are a divine little Angel that's the truth  Jaq  Do you think so  Fab  I'll swear itOh  apropos  my dear Jaquelina I had almost forgot to tell you how devilishly I am in love with you  Jaq  Are you  Fab  Desperately I though to have mentioned it the last time I saw you but some how or other the thing escaped my memoryIndeed one has so many affairs on hand one cannot think of every thing I recollected it before I had got a dozen yards from the door but then it was too late so I tied a knot in my handkerchief as you see to remind me the next time I met you  Jaq  That was extremely kind of you And really you are atolerablyimpudentagreeable fellowPraywhere did you lay in all that large as  ortment of assurance  Fab  By a long intercourse with people of fashion  Jaq  There I believe you are mistaken Mr Fabio You footmen have not learnt your agreeable assurance by imitating your betters but your betters have learnt theirs by imitating you  Fab  Upon my honor my dear I believe you are right footmen and keptmistresses lead the  ton  Jaq  Well Mr Fabio I must be gone and deliver your letter  Fab  You'll remember what I have said to you  Jaq  I'll tie a knot in my handkerchief  Fab  Ay do do  SONG  JAQUELINO  I'll certainly do my endeavor  Dear Sir  To remember your handkerchief favor  Dear Sir  I shan't want the wit to get out of your debt  Nor can I forget  That you're most prodigiously clever  Dear Sir  II  Your shape air and gait are so striking  Dear Sir  What damsel but must take a liking  Dear Sir  Turn about Sir look there how genteel debonnaire  Well I vow and declare  Oh dear you're prodigiously striking  Dear Sir  Exit  Fab  Now will I go in search ofwho have we here  Enter  Pedro  singing  My quondam comrade Pedro  Ped  The same  Fab  Still one of us I seeAnd how has fortune behaved to thee since I saw thee last  Ped  As she generally behaves to men of meritvery ill  Fab  TrueI am a living proof of her injusticeHad she treated me according to my deserts  Ped  Thou had'st been hang'd long ago  Fab  What still aiming at witwilt thou never learn a little common sense The way to thrive is not to persuade thysels but others that they are wittyWhat hast thou got in that brown paper parcel  Ped  My whole estate real and personal  Fab  Laughing  What all  Ped  All these few reals exepted  holding out his hand  with which I am going to purchase  Fab  What  Ped  A good lining  Fab  To a bad outside  Ped  No matter for thatHe that wants me may find me any time these two hours at the three Jolly Friars  Fab  What thou art in want of a place  Ped  Why no don't I tell thee I have not spent all my money  Fab  It's a great pity my master has got Don Pimiento's consent to marry his daughter Thou hast an excellent turn for intrigue and I might have helped thee to employment  Ped  Ay it's a damn'd shame fathers should be so reasonable and compliantBut no matterI desy Fortune with all her crew of obstinate relations called Fates and DestiniesWhen one spoke of the wheel is up another must be downThe road of life is very hillyfull of ups and downs  SONG  Of ups and downs we daily see  Examples most surprising  The High and Low of each degree  Now falling are now rising  Some up some down some in some out  Some neither one nor t'other  Knaves Fools Jews Gentiles join the  ou  And jostle one another  With my heigho  Geeup geeho  Higgledy piggledy  Truth Honour Honesty  Trim tram  Your Honesty's scarce  Honour's grown a meer farce  And poor Truth baw an obsolete Whimwham  II  By ups and downs some folks they say  Among grandees have got sir  Altho' they were but yesterday  The Lord knows who or what sir  Sans  sense or pence in Merit's chair  They doze and dream supineo  But how the devil they came there  That neither you nor I know  With my heigho c  III  Your country maid comes up to town  A simple aukward body  In half a year again goes down  No peacock half so gaudy  Lord ma'am exclaims the lawyer's wife  With scandal ever ready  You see the ups and downs of life  Have made our Meg a lady  With my heigho c  IV  Virtue and Vanity lately are grown  Mere buckets in a well sir  The last gets up the first gets down  As all the world can tell sir  So many downs poor Virtue meets  Her ups so very few sir  Tis said she's naked met i'th' streets  But that is nothing new sir  With my heigho c  V  Oh what an age of ups and downs  Hey seven's the main my lord thrice knocks  And lands and liberties manors and towns  Are rattling in the dicebox  Up fly the

to his father  Be certain sir your compliance in this particular would ensure my everlasting gratitude  D Sal  But I tell you Don Pimiento is a passionate positive captious  D Fer  Nay but hear me sir  D Sal  A pretended Philosopher A head so full of whims So tenacious of his opinionsI hate to see any man tenacious of his opinionsNo no I am fully convinced he is a weak silly wrongheaded old Lord and I am certain all the arguments in the world will never persuade me to the contrary    During this speech  Fabio  takes  Fernando  up the Stage and whispers him    D Fer  My dear father I have just received a message from Donna Zelida She informs me her father is consenting to our union and wishes to see both you and me Surely sir you will not refuse  D Sal  Don Pimiento wishes to see me you say  D Fer  Yes sir  D Sal  Well well that being the case I can have no objection to the daughter  Exeunt into the house of Don Julio Pimiento  SCENE  changes to the museum of  Don Julio Pimiento  Zelida

hastily reads  Donna Zel  UmumWellUmumumumvery wellBut did you deliver my message  Jaq  Oh yes madam and you need not doubt but Don Fernando will soon be here  Donna Zel  I need not question his love and diligence I am certain of his affection and sincerity or whatever it might cost me I would not indulge the sweet sensations the raptures I feel at his remembrance  Jaq  Why to be sure madam lovelove is a most delicious thingAnd tho' these men fellows are sometimes in their airs and are proud and cross and unconstant yet they are sometimes so loving and so sweet and so fond that one cannot help liking them with all their faults  Donna Zel  This kind compliance of my father to our union will make me love him if possible better than ever  Sighs  Jaq  But why madam sorry or pleas'd vex'd of glad do you always sigh  Donna Zel  A sigh Jaquelina is the constant and first effusion of a feeling heart  SONG  When adverse to love we stern destiny find  And our pangs have no hope of relief  Despair haunts each thought languor seizes the mind  And we sigh with th' excess of our grief  Or when by kind fortune revers'd is our lot  And sorrows no longer annoy  Again the tear flows when the terror's forgot  And we sigh with th' excess of our joy  Exeunt  Enter  Don Julio Pimiento  and  Fernando  D Fer  Your consent sir makes me the happiest of men and my heart assures me I shall become the most affectionate the most constant the tenderest of husbands  D Pimi  I hope so Zelida deserves the most affectionate and tenderest of husbands  D Fer  Deserves Oh yes sir she deserves more than the world has to give  D Pimi  Tho' I partly approve your transports young gentleman you must moderate your ecstacies Let' philosophy teach you to govern your passionsI had once as much fire and rhodornontade as you or any hotbrain'd Don in Spain I was obliged to steal my wife my Zelida's mother I tried every kind of stratagem to get at her but finding none of them were successful I set fire to the house and carried my mistress off thro' the midst of the flames  D Fer  Ay sir that was a lover's philosophy  D Pimi  But go and pay your mistress a morning visit you have no objection I suppose Your father and I will settle preliminaries  D Fer  I am sure sir they will be to our satisfaction  With hesitation  But excuse a lover's fearLet me beg let me conjure you sir to avoid every tendency to contradiction  D Pimi  Ay ay make yourself perfectly easy do not fear my discretion  D Fer  My father sir has his odditiesapt to laugh yet every body allows him to possess noble sentiments and a generous heart  D Pimi  I am as willing as any man to do justice to the good qualities of othersDon Salvador is a gentleman and a Spaniard  D Fer  Somewhat too passionate I confessAnd thensiryour temper beinga littlehasty  D Pimi  Hasty I hasty  D Fer  That issirhavinga littlegenerous warmth in your temper  D Pimi  Warmth young gentleman What do you mean by warmth No man has more philosophyNo man can be more cool more candid more open to conviction  D Fer  I own it sir  D Pimi  Aside  Yes but he is damn'd loth to own it tho'As for your father his positive obstinacy is become proverbial  D Fer  I allow sir he has a predilection for his own opinions Let me therefore once moreintreat  D Pim  'Pshaw Don't I tell you I am prepared to overlook his improprietiesThese modest hints this advice so adroitly insinuated is all superfluous to me and should have been bestowed at home upon your father  D Fer  Well sir I have your promise on that I will depend  SONG  Around the spacious landscape rove  The Naiad's haunt the Triton's bed  Search ev'ry grot and ev'ry grove  Where art and nature beauties shed  Whate'er is rich whate'er is rare  Whate'er is worthiest to be known  Collect from sea from earth and air  From fossil plant or precious stone  While wonders then with wonders vie  And latent miracles dispense  While this attracts the raptur'd eye  And that allures the ravish'd sense  Attentive while the busy sage  Delighted marks the boundless store  Exulting swells the learn'd page  With secrets unobserv'd before  Oh come in all thy native grace  Zelida come and bless the view  And ev'ry former wondrous trace  Shall vanish like the morning dew  Exit  Don Pimiento  alone  This is likely to be an important day The marriage of my daughter and the termination of my lawsuit with the house of CordovaIf justice takes place I cannot lose itAnd yet I have my fearsThe Count has great power at courtYet where right is so evident they will not dare do wrong    Goes and s  ats himself at his library table on which are various papers mathematical instruments crucibles phials c  Enter  Don Salvador  D Sal  Good morning Don Pimiento  D Pimi  Good morning good morning Don Salvador I have lately made some very curious experiments by which I find the ponderosity of light or to speak more philosophically the levity of light is extreme All Spain by no means contains a pound  D Sal  Ha ha ha ha ha  D Pimi  What do you laugh at Don Salvador I say the experiment is a very curious experiment  D Sal  Who doubts it Ha ha ha ha  D Pimi  Then what do you laugh at Don Salvador  D Sal  Laugh at To think what a devilish dear commodity light is in EnglandWell here you are like Noah in the ark surrounded by all your birds beasts infects and reptilesHa ha ha Philosophy must be a plaguy expensive plaything  D Pimi  Plaything sir Plaything Don Salvador  Let me advise you as a friend Don Salvador whenever you speak of philosophy to do it with more respect lest you should incur reproof from the learned and the wisePhilosophy Don Salvador philosophy is a Being of a superior and divine nature whose head is among the stars her feet in the bottomless deep and whose eye penetrates matter form and infinite space even to darkness and nonentity    As the Scene advances the laugh of Don Salvador becomes and increases into a laugh of vexation restrained  D Sal  Ha ha ha I always told you it was something monstrousA divine nature Philosophy Sir is a dissector of grubs a painter of shadowsshe was born in amazement with her mouth open has fed upon maggots and peers and pores till she fancies she finds miracles stuff'd in the cavity of a mite's cranium or hid in the hair of a flea's foot  D Pimi  Permit me to tell you Don Salvador philosophy is a thing totally beyond your comprehension  D Sal  half aside  Ha ha haha ha yes and yours tooOur present business Don Pimiento is the conclusion of our children's marriage Ha ha ha  D Pimi  It is so it is soand as I have promised your son Don Fernando to be cautious I shall take care to avoid all altercation  D Sal  Which promise if kept will redound very much to the honor of your understanding Don Julio Pimiento Ha ha ha  D Pimi  Do you mean to insinuate any thing to t  discredit of my understanding Don Salvador  D Sal  Ha ha ha I insinuate nothing Don Pimiento  D Pimi  Or that I am not circumspect in my conduct  D Sal  Ha ha ha  D Pimi  Sir I affirm no man is less captious  D Sal  You are a very worthy gentleman Don Pimiento but very choleric Ha ha ha  D Pimi  Choleric I choleric  D Sal  Were you as dispassionate as ready to listen to reason as I am  D Pimi  Youdispassionate  D Sal  I  D Pimi  Tow dipp'd in tar will not catch fire so suddenly or blaze out so furiouslyOil brandy and Phlogiston are not so inflammable  D Sal  Ha ha haha haYou are describing yourself Don Pimiento not meMy temper like a deep stream flows on smooth and unruffled  D Pimi  Smooth You Don Salvador FlowPardon me but yours is an electic fluid all flameHowever be under no constraint emit your sparks discharge yourself I am a philosopher and do not fear a shockBe you as captious as you please I shall be cool cautiously cook  D Sal  Ha ha ha I perceive Don Pimiento how remarkably you are disposed to coolness and caution  D Pimi  What do you mean by that Don Salvador Am I not cool Am I not cautious Is it pos  ible for any man to be more so  D Sal  Ha ha ha ha Well well where are our children  D Pimi  Am I not cool Don Salvador  D Sal  Exceedingly as cool as you were the other day when I laughed because you asserted heat was nothing  D Pimi  Sir you may laugh again if you please and I will assert again and will assert in the face of the whole world that heat is not a thing but a quality  D Sal  Ha ha ha ha And so you still persist in affirming that the blaze of a faggot or the light of a candle is nothing  D Pimi  Sir I affirm no such thing  D Sal  And that were I to burn my finger or scald my leg I should feel no pain  D Pimi  I say sir pain is a sensation produced by the reaction  D Sal  And if my house was burnt to the ground you would pretend it was still standing  D Pimi  Sir the reaction  D Sal  Or that the fiery lava of Mount Vesuvius while it sweeps away fields flocks men and cities is totally innocent has nothing pernicious in its effects  D Pimi  Sir the reaction  very loud and very angry  Sir I say no such thing  D Sal  Then what do you say sir  D Pimi  Sir you won't hear what I say sir you can't understand what I say sir  D Sal  That is your fault sir for not speaking intelligibly  D Pimi  Do you mean to call me a fool sir  D Sal  Sir I have too much respect to good manners to follow your example  D Pimi  Do you mean to say sir I don't know good manners  D Sal  I mean to say sir you don't practice 'em  D Pimi  Sir your son shall have no daughter of mine  D Sal  Sir both you and your daughter would be too much honor'd in the alliance  D Pimi  Too much honor'd Jaquelina Diego Who waits thereZelidaSomebody call my daughter  Enter  Fernando  and  Zelida  Donna Zel  My dear father what's the matter  D Pimi  Come here child come away from

offspring of such a passionate perverseBu  I despise  Donna Zel  My dear sir pray for Heav'n's sake forbear  D Fer  What can have occasioned  D Sal  With great contempt  Here has he been asserting again that fire won't burn that water can't quench it that Mahomet's black ram was an Alderney cow and that the man in the moon wears a Harlequin's jacket  D Pimi  Sir I asserted no such things I despise both buffoonery and buffoons  D Sal  Despise Do you despise me sir  D Fer  Getting between them and forcing him off  Pray sir consder sir  D Pimi  Sir I despise ignorance  Donna Zel  Keeping
