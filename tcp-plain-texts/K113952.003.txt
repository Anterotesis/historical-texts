POETICAL CALENDAR  MARCH AN ODE  LIke Jason arm'd in coat of mail  Who nobly won the golden fleece  Thro' heavy storms of wind and hail  March on a Ram triumphant rides  A warlike month averse to peace  No longer now the soldier bides  In huts hybernalo'er the plain  Embattled see the dread campaign  Or on the flood if war preside  See Britain's bloody pennant fly  Her's is the ocean free as wide  Wheree'er the sons of commerce sail  Wheree'er her canvas pinions ply  Her floating citadels prevail  O'er all the force of Gaul and Spain  Whose fleets no more usurp the main  Spring bids the frozen rivers flow  Knocks off their rigid bolts of ice  And melts huge Appenines of snow  By starts the flattering beams of noon  The linnet or the lark entice  To sing a momentary tune  But quick and sudden shifts the scene  And gales tempestuous intervene  Scarce does the primrose show her head  Tho' eldest daughter of the spring  Nor dares the cowslip leave her bed  Affrighted at the northern blast  Who blights each blossom with his wing  While the dun ether's overcast  Of violence how short the sway  'Tis but the pageant of a day  The gods take care of us below  Indulgent are their gifts to all  With hands unsparing they bestow  Impartial air and sun and rain  To bless this sublunary ball  And mingle pleasure with our pain  Content is ever in our power  And passes by us every hour  W  A VERNAL ODE SENT TO DR HERRING LATE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY MARCH XII MDCCLIV  BRight God of day whose genial power  Revives the buried seed  That spreads with foliage every bower  With verdure every mead  Bid all thy vernal breezes fly  Diffusing mildness thro' the sky  Give the soft season to our drooping plains  Sprinkled with rosy dews and salutary rains  Enough has winter's hand severe  Chastis'd this dreary coast  And chill'd the tender dawning year  With desolating frost  Give but thy vital beams to play  These icewrought scenes will melt away  And mix'd in sprightly dance the blooming Hours  Will wake the drowsy Spring the Spring awake the flowers  Let Health gay daughter of the skies  On Zephyr's wings descend  And scatter pleasures as she flies  Where Surry's downs extend  There Herring wooes her friendly power  There may she all her roses shower  To heal that shepherd all her balms employ  So will she sooth our fears and give a nation joy  The grateful seasons circling fast  Reviving suns restore  But life's short spring is quickly past  And blooms alas no more  Then let us ere by sure decays  We reach the winter of our days  In virtue emulate the blest above  And like the spring display benevolence and love  FF  AN ELEGY WRITTEN AT THE APPROACH OF SPRING  BY JS  STern Winter hence with all his train removes  And cheerful skies and limpid streams are seen  Thicksprouting foliage decorates the groves  Reviving herbage robes the fields in green  Yet lovelier scenes shall crown th' advancing year  When blooming Spring's full bounty is display'd  The smile of beauty every vale shall wear  The voice of song enliven every shade  O fancy paint not coming days too fair  Oft for the prospects sprightly May should yield  Rainpouring clouds have darken'd all the air  Or snows untimely whiten'd o'er the field  But should kind Spring her wonted bounty shower  The smile of beauty and the voice of song  If gloomy thought the human mind o'erpower  Even vernal hours glide unenjoy'd along  I shun the scenes where maddening passion raves  Where pride and folly high dominion hold  And unrelenting avarice drives her slaves  O'er prostrate virtue in pursuit of gold  The grassy lane the woodsurrounded field  The rude stone fence with fragrant wallflowers gay  The claybuilt cot to me more pleasure yield  Than all the pomp imperial domes display  And yet even here amid these secret shades  These simple scenes of unreprov'd delight  Affliction's iron hand my breast invades  And death's dread dart is ever in my sight  While genial suns to genial showers succeed  The air all mildness and the earth all bloom  While herds and flocks range sportive o'er the mead  Crop the sweet herb and snuff the rich perfume  O why alone to hapless man denied  To taste the bliss inferior beings boast  O why this fate that fear and pain divide  His few short hours on earth's delightful coast  Ah ceaseno more of Providence complain  'Tis sense of guilt that wakes the mind to woe  Gives force to fear adds energy to pain  And palls each joy by heaven indulg'd below  Why else the smiling infanttrain so blest  Ere dearbought knowlege ends the peace within  Or wild desire inflames the youthful breast  Or ill propension ripens into sin  As to the bleating tenants of the field  As to the sportive warblers on the trees  To them their joys sincere the seasons yield  And all their days and all their prospects please  Such joys were mine when from the peopled streets  Where on Thamesis' banks I liv'd immur'd  The newblown fields that breath'd a thousand sweets  To Surry's woodcrown'd hills my steps allur'd  O happy hours beyond recovery fled  What share I now that can your loss repay  While o'er my mind these glooms of thought are spread  And veil the light of life's meridian ray  Is there no power this darkness to remove  The longlost joys of Eden to restore  Or raise our views to happier seats above  Where fear and pain and death shall be no more  Yes those there are who know a Saviour's love  The longlost joys of Eden can restore  And raise their views to happier seats above  Where fear and pain and death shall be no more  These grateful share the gift of nature's hand  And in the varied scenes that round them shine  The fair the rich the awful and the grand  Admire th' amazing workmanship divine  Blows not a floweret in th' enamell'd vale  Shines not a pebble where the rivulet strays  Sports not an insect on the spicy gale  But claims their wonder and excites their praise  For them even vernal nature looks more gay  For them more lively hues the fields adorn  To them more fair the fairest smile of day  To them more sweet the sweetest breath of morn  They feel the bliss that hope and faith supply  They pass serene th' appointed hours that bring  The day that wafts them to the realms on high  The day that centres in eternal spring  SPRING A RURAL SONG  BY MR THO BREREWOOD  WHen approach'd by the fair dewy fingers of spring  Swelling buds open first and look gay  When the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing  And are danc'd by the breeze on each spray  When gently descending the rain in soft showers  With its moisture refreshes the ground  And the drops as they hang on the plants and the flowers  Like rich gems beam a lustre around  When the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe  And the cuckow proclaims with his voice  That nature marks this for the season to wooe  And for all that can love to rejoice  In a cottage at night may I spend all my time  In the fields and the meadows all day  With a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime  Young as April and blooming as May  When the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn  May my fairest and I sweetly wake  View the far distant hills which the sunbeams adorn  Then arise and our cottage forsake  When the sun shines so warm that my charmer and I  May recline on the turf without fear  Let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy  While we breathe the first sweets of the year  Be this spot on a hill and a spring from its side  Bubble out and transparently flow  Creep gently along in meanders and glide  Thro' the vale strow'd with daisies below  While the bee flies from blossom to blossom and sips  And the violets their sweetness impart  Let me hang on her neck and so taste from her lips  The rich cordial that thrills to the heart  While the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate  Which the fowler has caught in his snares  May we think ourselves blest that it is not our fate  To endure such an absence as theirs  May I listen to all her soft tender sweet notes  When she sings and no sounds interfere  But the warbling of birds which in stretching their throats  Are at strife to be louder than her  When the daises and cowslips and primroses blow  And checquer the meads and the lawns  May we see bounding there the swift lightfooted doe  And pursue with our eyes the young fawns  When the lapwings just fledg'd o'er the turf take their run  And the firstlings are all at their play  And the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun  Let us then be as frolic as they  When I talk of my love should I chance to espy  That she seems to mistrust what I say  By a tear that is ready to fall from her eye  With my lips let me wipe it away  If we sit or we walk may I cast round my eyes  And let no single beauty escape  But see none to create so much love and surprize  As her eyes and her face and her shape  Thus each day let us pass till the buds turn to leaves  And the meadows around us are mown  When the lass on the sweetsmelling haycock receives  What she afterwards blushes to own  When evenings grow cool and the flowers hang their heads  With the dew then no longer we'll roam  With my arm round her waist in a path thro' the meads  Let us hasten to find our way home  When the birds are at roost with their heads in their wings  Each one by the side of its mate  When a mist that arises a drowziness brings  Upon all but the owl and the bat  When soft rest is requir'd and the stars lend their light  And all nature lies quiet and still  When no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night  But at distance the clack of a mill  With peace for our pillow and free from all noise  So that voices in whispers are known  Let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys  That are mus'd on by lovers alone  THE VIOLET  HAil blooming daughter of the youthful year  Sweet to the smell and pleasing to the sight  How does thy presence gloomy nature cheer  And fill the bosom with a soft delight  At thy approach stern rugged winter flies  To pour his anger on the frozen north  While balmy zephyrs fill our peaceful skies  And call the buds and genial blossoms forth  The lark highmounting at the rise of day  Salutes the blushing morn with gladsome notes  The little warblers hop from spray to spray  And trill wild music thro' their tuneful throats  The shepherd counts his flock the rustic ploughs  The farmer views with joy his springing corn  The milkmaid drains the sweetlysmelling cows  And sings the pleasures of the April morn  Now lovers now the golden minute seize  In every word express a generous care  In every act be studious how to please  And weave the flowery chaplet for the fair  Pleas'd with the beauties of the rifled mead  Their smell her sense their colours strike her eye  Snowdrops like innocence in white array'd  And violets glowing with a purple die  Should ye ambitious strive to gain her ear  In softest words the moving tale convey  The moving tale shall gain a pitying tear  If it be true what antient poets say  Nature assum'd her loveliest fairest look  Cold chilling frosts and noxious damps were fled  When jolly Spring his native skies forsook  To wooe fair Flora to his fertile bed  Gay drest in all the colours of the bow  He sought the goddess in her fair abode  Quick winds and hasty showers his coming show  But his bright beams proclaim the present god  The fanning gales convey a grateful smell  From where the hyacinth and crocus blow  With sudden life the buds around him swell  And where he treads all flowers promiscuous grow  The feather'd songsters full of joy appear  And chant his nuptial bliss thro' every grove  Spring the gay god that leads the smiling year  And Flora queen of beauty and of love  From this unblam'd this chaste delight arose  An offspring worthy of their mutual flame  Invok'd Lucina eas'd the mother's throes  And Violetta was the daughter's name  Whate'er enraptur'd poets have design'd  Of wit youth beauty or excelling grace  The nymph enjoy'd in person and in mind  So bright her wit so beauteous was her face  Alas what ills must careless nymphs betide  Since prudence nought avails to guard the dame  Lascivious Pan the blooming virgin eyed  And vow'd by force to gratify his flame  The virtuous fair his loath'd embraces flies  The amorous god pursues with equal speed  The plains around reecho to her cries  While every power is absent from her aid  Fatigued her panting bosom heaves for breath  Her trembling legs refuse the tedious race  She faints she sinks into the arms of death  And a cold paleness overspreads her face  Her melancholy fate the mother mourns  With tears fastflowing in a gentle shower  The muchlamented child to life returns  No more a virgin but a purple flower  As long as grief for innocence distrest  As long as tears from gentle hearts shall flow  So long her fate shall melt the feeling breast  With generous pity and with virtuous woe  The gentle nymph the mournful story hears  Within her bosom various passions move  Soft pity melts her tender soul to tears  And virtuous pity is a friend to love  THE PROGRESS OF POETRY  BY MRS MADAN  Vitis ut arboribus decori est ut vitibus uvae  Ut gregibus tauri segetes ut pinguibus arvis  Tu decus omne tuis  VIRG  UNequal how shall I the search begin  Or paint with artless hand the awful scene  Thro' paths divine with steps adventurous tread  And trace the muses to their fountain head  Ye sacred nine your mighty aid impart  Assist my numbers and enlarge my heart  Direct my lyre and tune each trembling string  While Poetry's exalted charms I sing  How free as air her strains spontaneous move  Kindle to rage or melt the soul to love  How her first emanations dawn'd disclose  And where great source of verse bright Phoebus first arose  Where nature warmth and genius has denied  In vain are art's stiff languid powers applied  Unforc'd the muses smile above controul  No art can tune the inharmonious soul  Some rules 'tis true unerring you may cull  And void of life be regularly dull  Correctly flat may flow each studied rhime  And each low period indolently chime  A common ear perhaps or vulgar heart  Such lays may please the labour'd work of art  Far other strains delight the polish'd mind  The ear well judging and the taste refin'd  To blend in heavenly numbers ease and fire  An Addison will ask a Pope require  Genius alone can force like theirs bestow  As stars unconscious of their brightness glow  Hail Greece from whence the spark etherial came  That wide o'er earth diffus'd its sacred flame  There the first laurel form'd a deathless shade  And sprung immortal for thy Homer's head  There the great bard the rising wonder wrought  And plan'd the Iliad in his boundless thought  By no mean steps to full perfection grew  But burst at once refulgent to the view  Who can unmov'd the warm description read  Where the wing'd shaft repels the bounding steed  Where the torn spoils of the rapacious war  With shocking pomp adorn the victor's car  When from some hostile arm dismiss'd the reed  On the mark'd foe directs its thirsty speed  Such strength such action strikes our eager sight  We view and shudder at its fatal flight  We hear the straighten'd yew recoiling start  And see thro' air glide swift the whizzing dart  When higher themes a bolder strain demand  Life waits the poet's animating hand  There where majestic to the sanguin'd field  Stern Ajax stalks behind his sevenfold shield  Or where in polish'd arms severely bright  Pelides dreadful rushes to the fight  With martial ardor breathes each kindling page  The direful havock and unbounded rage  The clash of arms tumultuous from afar  And all that fires the hero's soul to war  Bold Pindar next with matchless force and fire  Divinely careless wak'd the sounding lyre  Unbound by rule he urg'd each vigorous lay  And gave his mighty genius room to play  The Grecian games employ his daring strings  In numbers rapid as the race he sings  Mark muse the conscious shade and vocal grove  Where Sappho tun'd her melting voice to love  While Echo each harmonious strain return'd  And with the soft complaining Lesbian mourn'd  With roses crown'd on flowers supinely laid  Anacreon next the sprightly lyre essay'd  In light fantastic measures beat the ground  Or dealt the mirthinspiring juice around  No care no thought the tuneful Teian knew  But mark'd with bliss each moment as it flew  Behold the soil where smooth Clitumnus glides  And rolls thro' smiling fields his ductile tides  Where swoln Eridanus in state proceeds  And tardy Mincio wanders thro' the meads  Where breathing flowers ambrosial sweets distil  And the soft air with balmy fragrance fill  O Italy tho' joyful plenty reigns  And nature laughs amid thy bloomy plains  Tho' all thy shades poetic warmth inspire  Tune the rapt soul and fan the sacred fire  Those plains and shades shall reach th' appointed date  And all their fading honours yield to fate  Thy wide renown and everblooming fame  Stand on the basis of a nobler claim  In thee his harp immortal Virgil strung  Of shepherds flocks and mighty heroes sung  See Horace shaded by the lyric wreath  Where every grace and all the muses breathe  Where courtly ease adorns each happy line  And Pindar's fire and Sappho's softness join  Politely wise with calm wellgovern'd rage  He lash'd the reigning follies of the age  With wit not spleen indulgently severe  To reach the heart he charm'd the listening ear  When soothing themes each milder note employ  Each milder note swells soft to love and joy  Smooth as the famepresaging  Vide Hor lib iii ode iv  doves that spread  Prophetic wreaths around his infant head  Ye numerous bards unsung whose various lays  A genius equal to your own should praise  Forgive the muse who feels an inbred flame  Resistless to exalt her country's fame  A foreign clime she leavesand turns her eyes  Where her own Britain's favourite towers arise  Where Thames rolls deep his plenteous tides around  His banks with thick ascending turrets crown'd  Yet not these scenes th' impartial muse could boast  Were liberty thy great distinction lost  Britannia hail o'er whose luxuriant plain  For the free natives waves the ripening grain  'Twas sacred liberty's celestial smile  First lur'd the muses to thy generous isle  'Twas liberty bestow'd the power to sing  And bid the verserewarding laurel spring  Here Chaucer first his comic vein display'd  And merry tales in homely guise convey'd  Unpolish'd beauties grac'd the artless song  Tho' rude the diction yet the sense was strong  To smoother strains chastising tuneless prose  In plain magnificence great Spencer rose  In forms distinct in each creating line  The virtues vices and the passions shine  Subservient nature aids the poet's rage  And with herself inspires each nervous page  Exalted Shakespear with a boundless mind  Rang'd far and wide a genius unconfin'd  The passions sway'd and captive led the heart  Without the critic's rules and void of art  So some fair clime by smiling Phoebus blest  And in a thousand charms by nature drest  Where limpid streams in wild meanders flow  And on the mountains towering forests grow  With lovely landscapes lures the ravish'd sight  While each new scene supplies a new delight  No industry of man no needless toil  Can mend the rich uncultivated soil  While Cowley's lays with sprightly vigour move  Around him wait the gods of verse and love  So quick the crouding images arise  The bright variety distracts our eyes  Each sparkling line where fire with fancy flows  The rich profusion of his genius shows  To Waller next my wondering view I bend  Gentle as flakes of feather'd snow descend  Not the same snow its silent journey done  More radiant glitters in the rising sun  O happy nymph who could those lays demand  And claim the care of this immortal hand  In vain might age thy heavenly form invade  And o'er thy beauties cast an envious shade  Waller the place of youth and bloom supplies  And gives exhaustless lustre to thy eyes  Each muse assisting rifles every grace  To paint the wonders of thy matchless face  Thus when at Greece divine Apelles strove  To give to earth the radiant queen of love  From each bright nymph some dazling charm he took  This fair one's lips another's lovely look  Each beauty pleas'd a smile or air bestows  Till all the goddess from the canvas rose  Immortal Milton hail whose lofty strain  With conscious strength does vulgar themes disdain  Sublime ascended thy superior soul  Where neither lightnings flash nor thunders roll  Where other suns drink deep th' eternal ray  And thence to other worlds transmit the day  Where high in ether countless planets move  And various moons attendant round them rove  O bear me to those soft delightful scenes  Where shades farspreading boast immortal greens  Where paradise unfolds her fragrant flowers  Her sweets unfading and celestial bowers  Where Zephyr breathes amid the blooming wild  Gentle as nature's infant beauty smil'd  Where gaily reigns one everlaughing spring  Eden's delights which thou alone couldst sing  Yet not these scenes could bound his daring flight  Born to the task he rose a nobler height  While o'er the lyre his hallow'd fingers fly  Each wonderous touch awakens raptures high  Those glorious seats he boldly durst explore  Where faith alone till then had power to soar  Smooth glide thy waves O Thames while I rehearse  Sir John Denham's Cooper'sHill  The name that taught thee first to flow in verse  Let sacred silence hush thy grateful tides  The osier cease to tremble on thy sides  Let thy calm waters gently steal along  Denham this homage claims while he inspires my song  Far as thy billows roll dispers'd away  To distant climes the honour'd name convey  Not Xanthus can a nobler glory boast  In whose rich stream a thousand floods are lost  The strong the soft the moving and the sweet  In artful Dryden's various numbers meet  Aw'd by his lays each rival bard retir'd  So fades the moon pale lifeless unadmir'd  When the bright sun bursts glorious on the sight  With radiant lustre and a flood of light  The comic muse with lively humour gay  In Congreve's strains does all her charms display  She rallies each absurd impertinence  And without labour laughs us into sense  The follies of mankind she sets to view  In scenes still pleasing and for ever new  Sure heaven that destin'd William to be great  The mighty bulwark of the British state  The scourge of tyrants guardian of the law  Bestow'd a Garth designing a Nassau  Wit ease and life in Prior blended flow  Polite as Granville soft as moving Rowe  Granville whose lays unnumber'd charms adorn  Serene and sprightly as the opening morn  Rowe who the spring of every passion knew  And from our eyes call'd forth the opening dew  Still shall his gentle muse our souls command  And our warm'd hearts confess his skilful hand  Be this the least of his superior fame  Whose happy genius caught great Lucan's flame  Where noble Pompey dauntless meets his doom  And each free strain breathes Liberty and Rome  O Addison lamented wonderous bard  The godlike hero's great his best reward  Not all the laurels reap'd on Blenheim's plains  A fame can give like thy immortal  The Campaign  strains  While Cato dictates in thy awful lines  Caesar himself with second lustre shines  As our rais'd souls the great distress pursue  Triumphs and crowns still lessen in our view  We trace the victor with disdainful eyes  And all that made a Cato bleed despise  The bold pindaric and soft lyric muse  Breath'd all her energy in tuneful Hughes  Music herself did on his lines bestow  The polish'd lustre and enchanting flow  His sweet cantatas and melodious song  Shall ever warble on the skilful tongue  When nobler themes a loftier strain require  His bosom glow'd with more than mortal fire  Not  See mr Hughes's ode entitled an ode to the Creator of the world occasioned by the fragments of Orpheus  Orpheus' self could in sublimer lays  Have sung th' omnipotent Creator's praise  Damascus' moving fate display'd to view  From every eye the ready tribute drew  Th' attentive ear the bright  Characters in his tragedy entitled the Siege of Damascus  Eudocia charms  And with the generous love of virtue warms  She seems above the ills she greatly bears  While  Characters in his tragedy entitled the Siege of Damascus  Phocyas' woes command our gushing tears  Characters in his tragedy entitled the Siege of Damascus  Abudah shines a pattern to mankind  In him the hero and the man are join'd  High on the radiant list see Pope appears  With all the fire of youth and strength of years  Wheree'er supreme he points the nervous line  Nature and art in bright conjunction shine  How just the turns how regular the draught  How smooth the language how refin'd the thought  Secure beneath the shade of early bays  He dar'd the thunder of great Homer's lays  A sacred heat inform'd his heaving breast  And Homer in his genius stands confest  To heights sublime he rais'd the ponderous lyre  And our cold isle grew warm with Grecian fire  Fain would I now th' excelling bard reveal  And point the seat where all the muses dwell  Where Phoebus has his warmest smiles bestow'd  And who most labours with th' inspiring god  But while I strive to fix the ray divine  And round that head the laurel'd triumph twine  Unnumber'd bards distract my dazzled sight  And my first choice grows faint with rival light  So the white road that streaks the cloudless skies  When silver Cynthia's temperate beams arise  Thick set with stars o'er our admiring heads  One undistinguish'd streamy twilight spreads  Pleas'd we behold from heaven's unbounded height  A thousand orbs pour forth promiscuous light  While all around the spangled lustre flows  In vain we strive to mark which brightest glows  From each the same enlivening splendors fly  And the diffusive glory charms the eye  TO THE MEMORY OF MR HUGHES  BY THE SAME  ROund Hughes's humble tho'distinguish'd urn  The Muses wreath'd with baleful cypress mourn  In every face a deep distress appears  Each eye o'erflows with tributary tears  Such was the scene when by the gods requir'd  Majestic Homer from the world retir'd  Such grief the Nine on Maro's tomb bestow'd  For Addison such sorrow lately flow'd  Snatch'd from the earth above its trifling praise  Thee Hughes to happier climes thy fate conveys  Eas'd of its load thy active spirit flies  From orb to orb and glides along the skies  The toils of life the pangs of death are o'er  And care and pain and sickness are no more  O may that spot which holds thy dear remains  The noblest spoil earth's spacious breast contains  Its tribute pay may richest flowers around  Spring lightly forth and mark the sacred ground  There may the bay her shady honours spread  And o'er thy urn delightful odours shed  Immortal as thy fame and writings grow  Till these shall cease to live or Thames to flow  Nature subdued foretold the great decline  And every heart was plung'd in grief but thine  Thy soul serene the conflict did maintain  And trac'd the phantom death thro' years of pain  Not years of pain thy steady mind alarm'd  By judgment strengthen'd and by virtue arm'd  Still like yourself when sinking life ebb'd low  You neither dar'd nor meanly fear'd the blow  Loose to the world by every grace possest  Greatly resign'd you sought the stranger rest  Fearless of fate thus thy own Phocyas died  When from his wound gush'd forth the purple tide  Drawn by thy pen the theory we see  The practic part too soon we learn from thee  Who now shall touch the lyre with skill divine  Or who to tuneful airs shall tuneful numbers join  Who shall the rapid tide of vice controul  At once enchant the sense and mend the soul  In whom shall the fair sisterarts unite  With virtue solid sense and boundless wit  Such was the turn of thy exalted mind  Sparkling as polish'd gems as purest gold refin'd  Great ruler of our passions who with art  Subdued the fierce and warm'd the frozen heart  Bid glory in our breasts with temper beat  And genuine valour free from feverish heat  Bid love in all its native lustre rise  And in Eudocia's form delight our eyes  Virtue distress'd thy happy lines disclose  With more of triumph than a conqueror knows  Touch'd by thy hand our stubborn tempers bend  And flowing tears the wellwrought scene attend  That silent eloquence thy power approv'd  The cause so great 'twas generous to be mov'd  What pleasure can the bursting heart possess  In the last parting and severe distress  Can fame wealth honour titles joy bestow  And make the labouring breast with transport glow  These gaudy trifles gild our dawning light  But oh how weak their influence on our night  Then fame wealth honour titles vainly bloom  Nor dart one gleam of comfort on the tomb  The only joy the struggling soul receives  Is in th' applause that conscious virtue gives  This cordial joy retiring Hughes poss'ess'd  This cheer'd his dying hours compos'd his breast  And sooth'd his pure and peaceful soul to rest  Free from the bigot's fear or stoic's pride  Serene he liv'd and as serenely died  When on life's utmost verge he dauntless stood  dy to plunge and seize th' immortal good  Collecting all his scatter'd rays in one  His last  The Siege of Damascus  exalted work intensely shone  His living sentiments there sketch'd we view'd  But while our eyes the shining path pursued  And wonderous heights his towering muse had gain'd  Alas the shining path alone remain'd  So when the sun to worlds unknown retires  How strong how boldly shoot his parting fires  Larger his setting orb our eyes confess  Eager we gaze and the full glory bless  As o'er the heaven sublime his course extends  With equal pomp the radiant power descends  Sinks to the seas with golden lustre bright  And paints the clouds with beauteous tracts of light  THE DEATH OF ARACHNE  AN HEROICOMITRAGICPOEM  THE shrinking brooks and russet meads complain'd  That summer's tyrant fervid Sirius reign'd  Full west the sun from heaven descending rode  And six the shadow on the dial show'd  Philo tho' young to musing much inclin'd  A shameless sloven in his gown had din'd  From table sneaking with a sheepish face  Before the circle was dismiss'd with grace  And smoaking now his desk with books o'erspread  Thick clouds of incense roll around his head  His head which save a quarter's growth of hair  His woollen cap long since scratch'd off was bare  His beard three days had grown of golden hue  Black was his shirt uncomely to the view  Crosslegg'd he sat and his ungarter'd hose  Of each lean limb half hide and half expose  His cheek he lean'd upon his hand below  His nutbrown slipper hung upon his toe  Now with abstracted flight he climbs apace  High and more high thro' pure unbounded space  Now mere privation fails the wings of thought  He drops down headlong thro' the vast of nought  A friendly vapour Mathesis supplies  Born on the surging smoke he joys to rise  Matter thro' modes and qualities pursues  Now caught entranc'd its naked essence views  Now wakes the vision fading from his sight  Leaves doubts behind the mists of mental night  Existing not but possible alone  He deems all substance and suspects his own  Like wave by wave impell'd now questions roll  Does soul in ought subsist or all in soul  Is space extension nothing but a name  And mere idea nature's mighty frame  All power all forms to intellect confin'd  Place agent subject instrument combin'd  Is spirit diverse yet from number free  Conjoin'd by harmony in unity  Truth's spotless white what piercing eye descries  When the ray broken takes opinion's dyes  In vain now Philo seeks the sacred light  In chaos plung'd where embryo systems fight  In this dark hour unnotic'd Cloe came  His studydoor admits the shining dame  With nature's charms she join'd the charms of art  Wife of his choice and mistress of his heart  What on her head she wore erect and high  Unnam'd above is call'd on earth a fly  In wanton ringlets her fair tresses fell  Her breasts beneath transparent muslin swell  Studded with flaming gems a buckle bound  Th' embroider'd zone her slender waist around  Thence to her feet a vast rotund display'd  The mingling colours of the rich brocade  This aiding fancy blending shame and pride  Inflames with beauties it was meant to hide  With careless ease the nymph first snapp'd her fan  Roll'd round her radiant eyes and thus began  " How canst thou Philo here delight to sit  " Immers'd in learning nastiness and wit  " Clean from the chest where various odours breathe  " And dying roses their last sweets bequeath  " A shirt for thee by my command the maid  " Three hours ago before the fire display'd  " The barber waiting to renew thy face  " Holds thy wig powder'd in the pastboard case  " Thy silken breeches and thy hose of thread  " Coat waistcoat all lie ready on the bed  " Renounce that odious pipe this filthy cell  " Where silence dust and pagan authors dwell  " Come shall the ladies wait in vain for thee  " Come taste with us the charms of mirth and tea"  As Philo heard confus'd the silver sound  His soul emerges from the dark profound  On the bright vision full he turn'd his eyes  Touch'd as he gaz'd with pleasure and surprize  The first faint dawnings of a smile appear'd  And now in act to speak he strok'd his beard  When from a shelf just o'er the fair one's head  Down dropp'd Arachne by the viscous thread  Back starts the nymph with terror and dismay  " The spider oh"was all that she could say  At this the sage resum'd the look severe  ' Renounce with woman's folly woman's fear  He said and careful to the shelf convey'd  The hapless rival of the blueeyed maid  Th' enormous deed astonish'd Cloe view'd  And rage the crimson on her cheek renew'd  " Must then said she such hideous vermin crawl  " Indulg'd protected o'er the cobwebb'd wall  " Destroy her quicklyhere her life I claim  " If not for love or decency for shame"  ' Shame be to guilt replies the man of thought  ' To slaves of custom ne'er by reason taught  ' Who spare no life that touches not their own  ' By fear their cruelty restrain'd alone  ' No blameless insect lives its destin'd hour  ' Caught in the murdering vortex of their power  ' For me the virtues of the mind I learn  ' From sage Arachne for whose life you burn  ' From her when busy all the summer's day  ' She weaves the curious woof that snares her prey  ' I learn fair industry and art to prize  ' Admiring nature providently wise  ' Who tho' her bounty unexhausted flows  ' Not daily bread on idleness bestows  ' Arachne still superior to despair  ' Restores with art what accidents impair  ' The thousandth time the broken thread renews  ' And one great end with fortitude pursues  ' To me her toil is ne'er renew'd in vain  ' Taught what the wise by perseverance gain  ' Warm'd by example to the glorious strife  ' And taught to conquer in the fight of life  ' When now with rest amidst her labours crown'd  ' She watchful patient eyes the circle round  ' I learn when toil has well deserv'd success  ' Hope's placid calm expectance to possess  ' With care to watch with patience still to wait  ' The golden moment tho' delay'd by fate'  Impatient Cloe thus again replied  " How soon is error thro' each veil descried  " Still boasting reason's power how weak are we  " How blind alas to all we would not see  " Else how could Philo in a spider's cause  " Talk thus of mercy with deserv'd applause  " Or call aught virtuous industry and skill  " Exerted only to surprize and kill  " The blameless infect whom no murder feeds  " For her the victim of her cunning bleeds  " Cunning which when to wisdom we compare  " Is but to her to men what monkeys are"  ' Hold Philo cries and know the same decree  ' Gave her the fly which gives the lamb to thee  ' Or why those wings adapted to the snare  ' Why interceptive hangs the net in air  ' As plain in these the precept "kill and eat"  ' As in thy skill to carve the living treat'  To this she cries "Persuade me if you can  " Man's lord of all and all was made for man"  ' Vain thought the child of ignorance and pride'  Disdainful smiling quickly he replied  ' To man vain reptile tell me of what use  ' Are all that Afric's peopled wastes produce  ' The nameless monsters of the swarming seas  ' The pigmy nations wafted on the breeze  ' The happy myriads by his eyes unseen  ' That bask in flowers and quicken all the green  ' Why live these numbers blest in nature's state  ' Why lives this spider object of thy hate  ' Why man but life in common to possess  ' Wide to diffuse the stream of happiness  ' Blest stream th' o'erflowing of the parent mind  ' Great without pride and without weakness kind'  With downcast eyes and sighs and modest air  Thus in soft sounds replied the wily fair  " This fatal subtilty thy books impart  " To baffle truth when unsustain'd by art  " For this when Cloe goes at twelve to bed  " Till three you sit in converse with the dead  " No wonder then in vain my skill's employ'd  " To prove it best that vermin be destroy'd  " But tho' you proudly triumph o'er my sex  " Joy to confute and reason but to vex  " Yet if you lov'd me to oblige your wife  " What could you less you'd take a spider's life  " Once to prevent my wishes Philo flew  " But time that alters all has alter'd you  " Yet still unchang'd poor Cloe's love remains  " These tears my witness which your pride disdains  " These tears at once my witness and relief"  Here paus'd the fair all eloquent in grief  He who had often and alone o'erturn'd  Witlings and sophists when his fury burn'd  Now yields to love the fortress of his soul  His eyes with vengeance on Arachne roll  ' Curs'd wretch thou poisonous quintessence of ill  ' Those precious drops unpunish'd shalt thou spill'  He said and stooping from his foot he drew  Black as his purpose what was once a shoe  Now high in air the fatal heel ascends  Reason's last effort now the stroke suspends  In doubt he stoodwhen breath'd from Cloe's breast  A struggling sigh her inward grief exprest  Fir'd by the sound 'Die sorceress die' he cried  And to his arm his utmost strength applied  Crush'd falls the foe one complicated wound  And the smote shelf returns a jarring sound  On Ida's top thus Venus erst prevail'd  When all the sapience of Minerva fail'd  Thus to like arts a prey as poets tell  By Juno lov'd in vain great Dido fell  And thus for ever Beauty shall controul  The saint's the sage's and the hero's soul  But Jove with hate beheld th' atrocious deed  And Vengeance follows with tremendous speed  In Philo's mind she quench'd the ray that fir'd  With love of science and with verse inspir'd  Expung'd at once the philosophic theme  All sages think and all that poets dream  Yields him thus chang'd a vassal to the fair  And forth she leads him with a victor's air  Drest to her wish he mixes with the gay  As much a trifle and as vain as they  To fix their power and rivet fast the chain  They lead where Pleasure spreads her soft domain  Where drown'd in music Reason's hoarser call  Love smiles triumphant in thy groves Vauxhall  LIFE AN ODE  LIfe the dear precarious boon  Soon we lose alas how soon  Fleeting vision falsely gay  Grasp'd in vain it fades away  Mixing with surrounding shades  Lovely vision how it fades  Let the muse in fancy's glass  Catch the phantoms as they pass  See they rise a nymph behold  Careless wanton young and bold  Mark her devious hasty pace  Antic dress and thoughtless face  Smiling cheeks and roving eyes  Causeless mirth and vain surprize  Tripping at her side a boy  Shares her wonder and her joy  This is Folly Childhood's guide  This is Childhood at her side  What is he succeeding now  Myrtles blooming on his brow  Bright and blushing as the morn  Not on earth a mortal born  Shafts to pierce the strong I view  Wings the flying to pursue  Victim of his power behind  Stalks a slave of human kind  Whose disdain of all the free  Speaks his mind's captivity  Love's the tyrant Youth the slave  Youth in vain is wise or brave  Love with conscious pride defies  All the brave and all the wise  Who art thou with anxious mien  Stealing o'er the shifting scene  Eyes with tedious vigils red  Sighs by doubts and wishes bred  Cautious step and glancing leer  Speak thy woes and speak thy fear  Arm in arm what wretch is he  Like thyself who walks with thee  Like thy own his fears and woes  All thy

rest  Amidst thy sweet enchantments blest  O let me with thy poppies crown'd  Unconscious tread this thorny ground  Thy pleasing dreams before me spread  And stretch thy wings to guard my head  Secure amidst surrounding strife  Nor wak'd by all the storms of life  The brighter side of wealth and power  Shall bless the visionary hour  Wealth without care shall be possest  And power without a guilty breast  Pomp free from flattery and from scorn  And love's sweet flower without the thorn  While Fortune with an erring hand  Her bounty scatters thro' the land  And fools and knaves the treasures find  By heaven for knaves and fools design'd  Not unrewarded Virtue sighs  In Hope her lasting pleasure lies  Nor while Astrea holds the scale  Shall vice and ponderous gold prevail  By Hope external wants supplied  She turns the beam on Virtue's side  Here Time with sweeping stroke destroys  Like grass possession's transient joys  Hope like the pine aspiring high  Can all the rage of time defy  For each lopp'd branch the vigorous root  Ordains a double branch to shoot  For one a thousand stems arise  And bloom and bear beyond the skies  If Hope no distant blessing shows  In vain is all the world bestows  If future joys her smiles display  In vain is all it takes away  The loss of power of fame of wealth  Yet more of friends of ease and health  By strength of mind we learn to bear  And live and smile in spite of care  But losing thee all comforts fly  We languish we despair we die  Beyond our reach but still in sight  Thy glittering objects yield delight  If chance possession brings them near  We lose the fading joy in fear  What charm'd the sight as good and fair  When touch'd we mourn as clouds and air  Yet fond the vapour to retain  Each parting fragment gives us pain  Thy cheerful light with guiding ray  Thro' life directs our doubtful way  Invites the journey to fulfil  Before us and before us still  The grave we reach thy pointing hand  Beyond it shows the promis'd land  The last best effort of thy power  Sustains us in the dreadful hour  Thy charge and all our travels o'er  We leave thee on the mortal shore  On realms unknown we land and share  A fate beyond thy influence there  Whate'er in realms unknown I be  Hope let me live on earth with thee  ODE TO PLEASURE  SIster of Youth and laughing Joy  Sweet Pleasure sorrowsoothing queen  Daughter of Venus

pedant love to waste  In studious search the tedious night  Attentive to the learned page  By musing taper's glimmering light  Whose pensive ear no wakeful sounds alarm  Save the lone owl slow clock or bellman's drowsy charm  Me let the cheerful dance engage  Swifturg'd along the lighted dome  While with new warmth the virgin glows  Her cheek all flush'd with fresher bloom  Motion and music tenderest thoughts inspire  And all her yielding soul relents to soft desire  Let the sage hermit shun mankind  With paleeyed Penitence to dwell  To freeze at midnight hours of prayer  Within a solitary cell  Penurious on the verdant herb to sup  And of the chilling stream to drain his beechen cup  Be mine amidst the social band  The raptures of champaign to taste  Whose vigorous juice new relish gives  To mutual converse Reason's feast  While old Anacreon seems to rise and say  " Begone ye toils of life ye busy cares away"  THE KITE  AN HEROICOMIC POEM IN THREE CANTOS  BY THE REV DR BACON  CANTO I  ARGUMENT  Dian's character Cupid jealous of her growing power retires to her apartment and seizes the copybook by which she first learn'd to write A description of it He finds the young lady at her harpsichord The particulars of her song  TO chase the timorous hare young Dian knew  Or thro' the woods the flying deer pursue  O'er the high mound her courser rag'd secure  Eager yet conscious of the charge he bore  While health auspicious mantled in her face  Glow'd on her cheek and heighten'd every grace  Or if the clamorous echoes of the field  To the gay dance and sweeter music yield  Her courtly motion set the soul on fire  And told us all the graces of the lyre  If Dian at the frame display'd her power  And charg'd the needle with the future flower  New life like some kind destiny she gives  And in a nobler loom the  Alluding to particular names given by florists c  heroe lives  Here Ormond's duke retir'd from martial cares  The peaceful scarlet of a tulip wears  There great Eugene in azure robes array'd  Confest his toils and dangers well repaid  Here grew adorn'd with every spreading grace  The purple honours of the gay Borlace  On this fair stalk the Gallic monarch shone  More powerful on her apron than his throne  Love with a jealous eye beheld the fair  Her conquests number'd and began to fear  Watch'd every glance that wander'd from her eye  And saw with less success his arrows fly  " But must that empire I derive from heaven  " Be given to Dian all so cheaply given  " Nations no more at my dread altars bow  " And these victorious shafts lie useless now  " Not so the golden trophy Venus gain'd  " 'Twas with the ruins of a Troy she reign'd  " When flighted Juno raging with despair  " Led sternly out her booted Greeks to war  So griev'd the god and stung with fury fled  Where Jealous rage and pale resentment led  Sacred to secrecy and soft repose  Rose an alcove where rang'd in artful rows  By Dian wrought the drowsy poppy grows  The virgin here like Sol's declining ray  Withdrew her lustre and retir'd from day  Gay Fancy ever waking here retains  Her liveliest visions and her softest scenes  While Slumbers round their silent station take  And seal those eyes that keep the world awake  Where weddingcake inspiring pleasing dreams  The happy partner of her bed proclaims  While guardian Loves the merry dance begin  And jolly Hymen leads the bridegroom in  In caskets here unnumber'd trophies lay  And loaded shelves their mimic pomp display  Here papertowns their waving turrets show  And forests from her scissars taught to grow  There the proud ship extends its wonderous frame  And to the maid brings home eternal fame  Carnations here the lingering eye regale  Here ever blows the lilly of the vale  The lavish rose here wantons all the year  So spreads its blooming leaves so blushes here  Here to repair his loss poor Cupid flies  And darts in every cask his restless eyes  Beneath a gilded pile of billetdeux  Cupid at length the marbled quarto views  That taught her words a sable hue to wear  And bid them please the eye as well as ear  In virgin order the coy letters move  Nor modest know the closer ties of love  Yet not the chief that boasts a flourish'd train  The rolling beauties of a hasty pen  With all his gaudy ornaments could please  More than the simple elegance of these  Here A by himself A surnam'd the great  With awful front o'erlooks the little state  And like Aeneas with majestic pace  T' Italian order leads his letter'd race  While next him little a with youthful pride  Trips like Iülus by his father's side  Here bending c's disclose half orbs of light  Like the new honours of the queen of night  There i like the fifth Edward stands display'd  His crown for ever hanging o'er his head  There o distinguish'd by his curious round  And q by children in the corner found  The s with arched neck and tail reclin'd  And the twin u's in sacred friendship join'd  Each letter thus by different beauties known  In order led the gay succession on  Trembling with eager joy he snatch'd the prize  Dian no more grew hateful to his eyes  And now in haste his golden wings he spread  And all impatient sought the beauteous maid  Fix'd to the lyre he found the tuneful fair  The mystic numbers well deserv'd his ear  She sung when ghosts approach why lights burn blue  Why candles show the future billetdoux  Why from the taper rose the virginstrife  Why chastest breath recalls it into life  Why the young Hylas bids his father run  T' obey the summons of a watery sun  And why to think should aid the housewife's skill  And thro' the joint conduct the lucky steel  What certain ills succeed if crickets call  Why states and saltsellers together fall  CANTO II  ARGUMENT  Cupid opens his design of making the Kite and offers his arms to Dian The Loves descend The plan for the Kite is laid out by a mechanical Love who begs Cupid's bow of Dian They all assist in the work till the leaves of the copybook are used Here Mercury seasonably furnishes them with acts of parliament The tail is finish'd and the lanthorn added by Dian Cupid receives it and institutes the game of leaping over the candle A short episode on this subject  THE virgin ceas'd and Venus' smiling son  The volume waving in his hand begun  " If e'er I taught that breast to fall and rise  " And emptied quivers from those sparkling eyes  " If I the lover sweetly to beguile  " Spread o'er those dimpled cheeks that winning smile  " Let Cupid once his earnest wish obtain  " Hear what he asks nor let him ask in vain  " Know then fair maid from Love's great sovereign know  " Has Cupid ought'Tis all fair Dian's now  " The world receives thy edicts with applause  " And Love's liege subjects hear from thee their laws  " Thee shall the Graces thee the Smiles attend  " And young Desires around their camp extend  " But shall these hands no mark of favour boast  " Robb'd of their armsmy bow my quiver lost  " Ah let the skilful maid a frame prepare  " These leaves so heaven has doom'd must rise in air  " Then born on Zephyrs shall thy work be seen  " And distant eyes adore the wing'd machine  " Cupid wellpleas'd shall guide its easy flight  " And Dian too shall view its wonderous height  " At Jove's command the royal eagle flies  " And bears his rolling thunder thro' the skies  " The gaudy peacock struts in plumy pride  " And stalks majestic by a Juno's side  " And tho' mamma prefers her wanton dove  " Cupid shall have a better bird than Jove"  Thus urg'd the power of loveAgreedshe cried  And reach'd the bow and quiver from his side  Now to their posts a thousand Loves descend  And round the fair with busy zeal attend  Among them one whom long experience blest  With a mechanic head above the rest  He form'd the ruff in good Eliza's days  And first confin'd the slender waist in stays  He first with beautyspots adorn'd the maid  And bid her borrow lustre from their shade  He knit the loversknot in times of old  And form'd the circle of the bridal gold  He on the ear first hung the sparkling rings  His was the tucker his the kissingstrings  He first in canvas hoop enclos'd the maid  Turn'd the round coif and rais'd the stiffen'd head  While other Loves the paste or packthread brought  Drew out the plan and built the bird in thought  He sought the wand which first her grandsire bore  Th' expressive ensign of the sheriff's power  This next the infant Dian active strode  And round the parlour fancied journeys rode  Its mane like gold in glittering tinsel spread  And painted streamers nodded o'er its head  But now miss Molly with becoming speed  Press'd with her wanton weight the nimble reed  Artful he tempts the little fair to stay  And steals the longdescended gift away  His useful theft the winged band approve  Fair Dian smil'd and thus began the Love  " Ah generous victor spare one useful toy  " Ah let us once again the bow enjoy  " Those eyes alone can greater mischiefs do  " Want not our skill and wound without our bow  " Be thine the turtles be the sparrows thine  " And keep the quiverbut the bow resign  " Crown'd with its arch Maria's horse shall rise  " And trail thy labours thro' the wondering skies"  Thus he nor sued in vain the maid gave ear  And with a graceful nod receiv'd his prayer  And now disrob'd of all its useless pride  Firm to the bow the pliant reed she tied  As when some full but distant mark in view  With stretch'dout arm the Parthian draws his yew  The string declining from its closing ends  Obliquely to the arrow's head descends  So sell the cord so stood the captive steed  By Dian's hand to rise for nobler flights decreed  The little Loves not idle by her side  For various works the manuscript divide  Those o'er the surface spread its leaves while these  Collect the sacred relicks for the stays  Exulting Cupid too his tribute brings  And waves on high the deeplyscollop'd wings  With art divine the fringe he gather'd round  And with a silken cord the tassels bound  His bow with these the power of love adorns  And the gay pendants tremble from its horns  Yet ah what boots his care what griefs attend  At once his hope his joy and labour end  The volume failsand still unfinish'd lies  The bird of Love still wants a tail to rise  But while around th' imperfect work they wait  Or by the silent maid all pensive sate  Hermes so bids the laughterlovingdame  Like an old justice of the quorum came  A dark fullbottom'd wig his temples shades  And o'er his shoulders venerably spreads  An antient cane his steady footsteps guide  And an old sword stuck stiffly by his side  With a long file of senateacts he came  These tax'd the landand those secur'd the game  In Dian's skilful hand he left the prize  And quick as thought shot upward to the skies  With cautious skill the shining steel she guides  And in small remnants Hermes' gift divides  Speeches of kings came flourish'd from her hand  And furl'd like heroe's plumes their edicts stand  Laws hung like cambrick on the wrists of beaux  And Anna's acts look'd like her furbeloes  These nicelygather'd on her lace she strung  And on the bird decrees of nations hung  Of proclamations next a dome she frames  Enclos'd within a living taper flames  Thro' equal folds its wanton blazes play  And wavy rounds transmit the silver ray  Cupid with reverence receives the prize  A thousand transports sparkling in his eyes  " And shall great actions public triumphs grace  " And does thy work he cried deserve them less  " When Python by Apollo's arm lay slain  " And stretch'd his livid body o'er the plain  " Revolving seasons did the deed proclaim  " And spoke the conquest in the Pythian game  " In every age this just reward was due  " And Roman games as Roman heroes grew  " But still to Love proceed no solemn shows  " No myrtle garland binds the victor's brows  " Hence then shall the gay youth and active maid  " In merry gambols fly o'er  This with the following episode refers to the riddle Little white Nancy c  Nancy's head  " For know that trembling light which glimmers there  " Was Nancy once a maid like Dian fair  " When merry sports the hoary season brings  " And raises hinds from slaves to shortliv'd kings  " When Rose the circling monarchy obtains  " And dreadful whiskers mark disloyal swains  " This sure at least may Nancy's memory claim  " And Dian's work demand a winter evening's game"  Thus spoke the God then spread his golden wings  And o'er the waving taper active springs  Fair Venus' sons the great example view  And o'er the light their vaulting chief pursue  But say my muse since thou alone canst tell  How Nancy liv'd and how lamented fell  Nancy a virgin of the vestal train  Hymen in marriage sought but sought in vain  In vain he strove with all his joys to move  And warm her marble breast to nuptial love  The nymph regardless of his prayers and sighs  From his embraces pale and panting flies  The God pursuedand now had reach'd the fair  As thus she cried"O holy Vesta hear  " Let Nancy still amid thy maiden choir  " From Hymen free preserve thy living fire"  She saidand sudden to a taper turn'd  And in his circling arms still trembling burn'd  " Yet shalt thou stubborn maid enrag'd he cried  " At all my weddingfeasts attend the bride  " Whereever Hymen's call'd thou too be there  " A witness to those joys thou wouldst not share"  Thus heand on his Nancy silent gaz'd  As her white petticoat around her blaz'd  So great Alcides from the world retir'd  And flaming in the magicshirt expir'd  CANTO III  ARGUMENT  One of the Loves is sent to Aeolus for a prosperous gale to fly the Kite Aeolus's cell described The Love returns with the gale to Dian Cupid gives directions for the flight Juno's envy who sends Iris to cut the string The Kite is turned into a star  BUT Cupid now with anxious thoughts oppress'd  Ceas'd from his sport and thus the Loves address'd  " Thus far have Jove and Fate propitious shone  " Our bird is finish'd and one labour done  " Its safety is our next our chiefest care  " While high it soars thro' pathless fields of air  " To guard it from the whirlwind's rapid power  " Or careful shield it from the treacherous shower  " Will Aeolus implor'd refuse his aid  " Or Jove deny when Love and Dian plead"  Scarce had he ended but a Love withdrew  And on the wings of generous duty flew  Nor tarried till he reach'd the distant cells  Where the hoarse wind's imperious tyrant dwells  Here breath'd the South that falls in genial showers  And gentle Zephyrs crown'd with vernal flowers  There blew the East that buttons breasts of beaux  And over Cloe's neck the tippet throws  Or with the North in dreadful union raves  Whirls o'er the main and rolls the madding waves  So if great things may be compar'd with small  And troubled oceans to a jug of ale  When Tattle heats the drink that cheers her soul  And to her tooth prepares the groaning bowl  Her giddy hands the mingling fluids shake  And the white bubbles o'er the the surface break  Unnumber'd virgins croud on every side  To various punishments condemn'd for pride  Belinda here her pins and powder tries  And the dear glass with fruitless labour eyes  Behind her chair the ruffling North attends  And ever discomposes as she mends  Raw vapours steam around the cruel fair  And winds that whistle nothing but despair  There Amoret cold piercing blasts pursue  And stain her nose with everlasting blue  Others whose hoops unwary youths enflam'd  Here runO Ld so rumpled and asham'd  Thro' these the Love and not regardless went  As onward to the monarch's throne he bent  The merchant here his ready aid implores  And asks a brighter gale from India's shores  There luckless Hero for a calm intreats  While her Leander tempts the fatal streights  And blackeyed Susan with impatience burns  To know how soon sweet William's ship returns  Whilst Aeol 'midst his guards in awful state  Array'd in furr like Russia's sovereign sate  His stretch'dout arm dispensing prosperous gales  To fame and conquest swells Britannia's sails  Now all was hush'd and Love his silence broke  And thus the windcompelling king bespoke  " If ever Dian's beauty reach'd thy cell  " If e'er thine eye beheld the sportive belle  " When the fair huntress foremost of the train  " Grew to her steed and scower'd along the plain  " If Aeol then in conscious rapture stray'd  " And round her neck in glad confusion play'd  " If then with greedy joy her lips he press'd  " Rumpled her tucker and unveil'd her breast  " That hand that did so oft thy bliss reprove  " Gives to thy charge this day the bird of Love  " Let Zephyrs then in active whispers breathe  " But every other wind be still as death  " This Fan be thine and such in love its power  " Not Jove in all his shapes e'er boasted more  " When future passions shall thy breast invade  " Be this the present to the favourite maid  " Its sheet unfurl'd reveals a scene of gold  " And Love in ambush lies in every fold  " Soon as her hand these painted altars raise  " The nymph not vainly with my arrows plays  " This ever shall new thoughts of thee suggest  " And bear thee to her lips and waft thee to her breast"  Thus heand the grim monarch of the wind  In swelling bags a happy gale confin'd  With these well fraught the Love returns to day  And back to Dian wings his liquid way  Now with the bird she seeks the flowery meads  Pancies and dazies spring wheree'er she treads  The little Loves around with decent pride  Hang on her hoop and triumph by her side  Lo mid the ranks superior Cupid moves  And issues out his orders to the Loves  To these he gave the lanthorn and the tail  But trebly charg'd 'em to supply the gale  A chosen cohort from the rest he drew  And to their care assign'd th' important clue  " Soon as the maid in equal poise sustains  " And on her arm my bird obliquely leans  " You forward hastethis glove shall be the sign  " With judgment to contract or give it line  " Do you with caution from the tail repair  " But yield the lanthorn with distinguish'd care  " Who diligent this day attends my bird  " His hand shall next to Cupid's hold the cord"  The glove was wav'dthe steady engine flew  Sprung into air and lessen'd to the view  Proudly it sail'd on crouding Zephyrs born  And every Love was pilot in his turn  Dian transported too beheld it fly  And to the taper grew her aking eye  But Cupid timorous saw its height in air  And thought his bird too distant from his care  'Twas he the messenger decreed to send  And would by proxy on his bird attend  What better than a billetdoux may prove  The tender representative of Love  For lo the maid a gilded sheet imparts  That breath'd unfeigned flames and real darts  Led by the clue its rapid flight it steers  And to the bird his airy summons bears  Ah what avail its easywaving wings  And length of tail that boasts successive acts of kings  How frail our span of time how fix'd its date  How soon the noblest labours yield to fate  Sleepbreaking care gay pleasure and pale woe  Meet in one stream and in one channel flow  Virtue but like a shining vapour flies  And when it brightest blazes soonest dies  For Juno now with memorable spight  Saw Cupid's bird and sicken'd at the sight  Her past dishonour all her breast alarms  Venus preferr'd and her own slighted charms  Now from her eye a gleam of envy breaks  And all the goddess to revenge awakes  " Shall Juno then inglorious quit the field  " And unreveng'd the palm of beauty yield  " If Ida's goddess boasts superior charms  " Why did my Jove prefer me to his arms  " But still her impious hands detain the prize  " Her power encreases and her altars rise  " While I to partial fate unheard complain  " And call for vengeance to the gods in vain  " But swift thro' ether let my Iris glide  " And hang my keenest scissars by her side  " For lo where yonder glimmering ray appears  " Her urchin's bird its airy journey steers  " There all his joy on one small thread depends  " That cutat once his hope and empire ends"  She said and Iris to her charge repairs  And reach'd the stringand clos'd the fatal sheers  Thrice was the baleful raven heard to croak  And hollow groans from heavy echoes broke  Screechowls around the dire event foreshew  And Cynthia from the mournful scene withdrew  Night silent bore it blazing thro' the air  And deck'd her mantle with the rising star  THE COPERNICAN SYSTEM  BY THE LATE SAM EDWARDS A B OF TRIN COL CAMB WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCXXXVIII  ASsist Urania the adventurous song  That from the towery height of heaven dost view  Unchang'd rotations and harmonious spheres  By thee th' inspir'd Chaldaean first observ'd  The various motions of the shining stars  And mark'd the rising or the setting sun  Whether in Aries or in Libra seen  His course performing thro' th' etherial space  By twelve conspicuous signs well known that show  The utmost margin of his rapid sway  In antient times so thought but now the sun  Fix'd in the centre of six orbits glows  Lightening six planets that around him roll  Fix'd as o'er Gibeon once when still he stood  Or as the moon in lowly Ajalon  When Joshua's mighty arm destroy'd the foes  Of Israel and Jehovah Israel's Lord  Hence light and heat imparting all around  Diffusive fountain both of light and heat  And vegetative force to all extends  From glowing Mercury to Saturn's frozen orb  Say Muse for well thou know'st what planet first  The sun surrounding takes its ambient course  Swift Mercury first feels the burning sun  That erst in air us'd unconfin'd to rove  The nimblefooted messenger of heaven  Now close confin'd a narrower limit knows  In fiery regions and the blaze of day  Dark with excessive lustre seldom seen  By eyes on earth but when th' allseeing sun  Hid and eclips'd by th' intervening moon  Unwillingly is lost 'tis only then  Thou Mercury art visible on earth  Swift is his motion as the tract not large  That moving in his circlet he describes  For in the space of three revolving moons  His journey finish'd he again renews  To thee O Venus next I tune my song  As next in order plac'd so next in light  Goddess of pleasing and of soft desire  That on the Paphian and the Cyprian groves  With influence sweet look'st down thy parent seas  Behold rejoicing when thy shining lamp  Ascending or descending cuts its way  Whether thou'rt Hesperus or Phosphor call'd  Now evening's grace and now the morning's pride  For if at setting sun thy orb we view  When doubtful twilight overshades the face  Of heaven and earth thou Hesperus deign'st to hear  But if at morn we spy thy glimmering rays  'Tis then thou'rt chang'd another and the same  Bright Phosphor hailto watchful shepherds known  That in the meadows tend their fleecy care  Greeting the day with merry pipe and glee  Nor does the moon alone her figure change  Even thou art mutable alike thy form  Horn'd or full orb'd at different times appears  Transported at the sight old Vulcan smiles  In air to see thee by those signs adorn'd  Which he on earth for thee contented bore  Bright as thou art and cloath'd in lucent beams  Yet when in close conjunction with the sun  A spot in his resplendent disk thou'rt seen  And deck'st his cheeks as Daphne once his brows  But oh more kind for never in thy round  In point of opposition art thou seen  Next rolls this earthly ball the seat of man  Obliquely cutting its etherial course  Thro' twelve bright constellations that adorn  Heaven's azure vault unalterably fix'd  First in his golden fleece the Ram leads on  With wonder and astonishment the Bull  Fierce as when once a god he stemm'd the sea  Bearing his lovely burden thro' the waves  Secure of tempest but not so Leander  Prosperous attain'd the long wish'd Sestian shore  Then next advance the Twins and then the Crab  The brindled Lion and the blushing Virgin  And Libra next that weighs in equal scales  Day answering night in length and night the day  The Scorpion now succeeds a fiery star  Stretching amain his formidable claws  Whence Caesar kens the votive world below  If Caesar haply shines a star on high  And sheds sweet influence down on thee O Rome  The hideous Archer next with fullbent bow  Half man half beast a monster terrible  As e'er was feign'd to guard th' etherial plains  Then bearded Capricorn attracts our view  Looking with wishful eyes upon the urn  Gushing with fluent streams as many a goat  On craggy mountain's top in antient Wales  Or from the Wreeking's vast stupendous height  Looks down upon the Severn's silver streams  Laving the flowery banks of fruitful Salop  The wintery Fishes close the heavenly rear  Their station 'tween Aquarius and the Ram  Lo these the signs of days of months and years  For when thro' twelve bright constellations Earth  Unwearied hath her radiant journey run  From whence it first set out it takes its course  Times also and their seasons well they note  For when the sun in fleecy Aries set  The fresh returning spring the heart of man  And beast rejoices with new vigour fraught  Pleas'd to behold the captivating scene  When newsprung glories ravish every eye  And sweet variety adorns the meads  Oh then how pleasurable 'tis to rove  On banks of Cam or Isis fam'd in song  To meditate the great Creator's praise  Who in his works so manifest is seen  As far as nature can her Author paint  But when th' exalted sun in Cancer rides  Excessive heats ensue 'tis then the plains  Parch'd and divided into many a crack  Gape and invoke the long suspended showers  Deepsounding thunders roll while from the clouds  The long imprison'd vapours burst their way  And the red lightnings dart their dreadful gleams  Making day hideousRound the grazing beasts  Fly trembling and their dark recesses seek  When equal Libra next brings forth the day  And raging Sirius fierce at midnight glares  Presaging storms and pestilence and death  Then frequent funerals in long order shine  And add a double horror to the night  And wider would extend their dreary doom  But for the cheerful gift of that kind God  That loads with clustering grapes the bending vines  But when Aquarius sheds its humid influence  Dark mists the traveller feelsBut stay my Muse  Urge not a theme already so well sung  Smooth as the ice they sing thy numbers flow  Mr Thompson author of a poem called Winter  Great Bard we quake and shudder at thy frost  O may they never who despise thy Muse  Alive or dead be by thy Muse adorn'd  Nor shall the earth's attendant pass unsung  Sole arbitress of night the paleeyed moon  Constant in her inconstancy 'tis she  Can raise or can depress the boisterous ocean  In Zenith towering or in Nadir low  Oft at thy pallid glimpse the fairy elves  With nimble feet the circling dance perform  In some thick grove or round a mossy spring  Sipping from acorn cups the pearly dews  And midnight revels celebrate with joy  To Mab their queen and Oberon their king  Oh thou the most irregular of all  The planets that describe their sloping way  Why is thy course protracted long and large  What time the jolly huntsman's cries resound  Is't to behold thy lov'd Endymion's face  That oft was wont in forests wild and wide  To chafe the scudding hare or trembling deer  O'er many a rising hill or lowly dale  Him to revisit oft thy silver sphere  So poets sing in heaven forsaken stood  Nor does the moon uncertain warning give  Of future storms for if a reddish hue  Its full orb'd disk o'erspreads then storms expect  And tempests yet to come to vex the main  With rage impetuous who then would choose  Wayward abroad companionless to rove  Thro' dreary deserts and unpeopled plains  Nor equal always is thy lustre seen  For dim suffusion oft and dusky shade  From earth projected intercepts thy light  Whole or in part eclips'd in vain the sound  Of tinkling cymbals and the direful clang  Of brazen cauldrons rung by vulgar hands  Thy labours thus attempt to mitigate  Next fiery Mars whose dreadful sport is war  Ascending terrible shoots forth his rays  That led th' imbattled deities to fight  Now unattended shines for no fair moon  By night his sphere adorns but fierce his look  Fierce as when once he rag'd at Ilium's walls  When struck by Diomed's adventurous arm  But oh what luckless fate what chance of war  Great hero led thee in illfated hour  With erring lance to wound fair beauty's queen  Majestic next and slow in awful state  Rolls Jupiter immense an equal bulk  Of all the wandering planets none can boast  Attended in his course by four bright moons  That faithful lend their well accepted light  Thus equal nature in her works decreed  By moons to aid a twelve years winter's frost  Nor summers there if summers there be known  Refuse th' assistance of those grateful lights  Nor do thy moons alone our wonder raise  When curious we behold thy many belts  That gird thy spacious body round and large  Form'd from thick vapours or eruption dire  Or was't from hence thy flaming lightnings flew  Drawn to transfix the rash Titanian race  That with presumptuous arms provok'd thy power  O'er mountains heap'd on mountains when they strove  Thy empire to dispute in impious war  Next thenbut a long interval between  Behold we tardy Saturn's livid face  In distance far remote the solar rays  Scarce cheer with light his unrejoicing orb  But for five moons that in alternate dance  Around him as their centre circling move  Darkness intense would overspread his face  Nor mean thy light that from thy lucent ring  Powerful reflected on thy surface shines  That now a gilt horizon round thee seems  Like to that light at close or dawn of day  When seen on earth now a resplendent arch  'Midst heaven's extended plains like that fair bow  Conspicuous in the clouds presaging calms  Our labour now the direful comets urge  Glaring tremendous thro' the vast expanse  Threatening destruction and the wreck of worlds  But that strict bounds direct and guide their course  Set when th' Almighty in creating hour  From chaos call'd the glorious universe  And fix'd the stars and bid the planets move  Where ether's space immense eludes our view  And planets in their orbs in order range  There free as air the fiery comets rove  And direful orbs their rapid course extend  Nor are their ways confus'd or intricate  Irregular in winding mazes lost  Eccentric error constant to itself  To one law subject one unerring rule  Of force attractive thus unwearied they  Now sweep the utmost confines of the world  Now basking in the neighbourhood of the sun  Then swiftly flying his too piercing heat  Rejoicing they ascend their labours to resume  Long tracts of light attend their dreadful course  But trust not to thy view a foreign light  And spurious honours deck their glowing mass  Dense atmospheres emit their furtive beams  Frequent and thick by heat intense exhal'd  The moon thus with fraternal lustre bright  Darts borrow'd rays and glories not her own  There are that fate foretelling fires believe  And conscious stars t' inspect the acts of men  And threaten wars from distant climes to come  Hence stupid and amaz'd the vulgar fear  And sceptred monarchs tremble on their thrones  Then happy he who with his virtue arrm'd  Unterrified amidst the crush of worlds  Meets willingly his long expected fate  But oh ye lights and influencing stars  Where then was fled your efficacious power  When towering Newton's eyes were clos'd in death  Or were ye bent his presence to obtain  To whom on earth so well your ways were known  Hail glorious shade in antient times foretold  Seneca  By Sage prophetic thou th' illustrious he  Destin'd to grace a new Augustan age  But when th'archangel's latest trump shall sound  And riven orbs destruction dire confess  Then shall thy system fail and nature's face  Renew'd in everlasting lustre shine  Then death shall conquer death the dreary tomb  Shall send forth glories that shall never fade  The damn'd shall mourn the funeral of death  And life not death of sin the wages be  Frauds dark as night and civil discords brood  When stars even blush at what is done below  For ne'er in heaven more frequent fires were seen  Than when the blood of Caesar tinctur'd Rome  Nor dost thou Rome alone the slaughter weep  Of fathers children brothers husbands wives  Even Albion once in grief could vie with thee  When Albion's sons 'gainst Albion's sons arose  But cease intestine broils so George commands  And whet your shining instruments of war  Employ'd much better on Iberian plains  And teach the treacherous soul in war to know  The just resentment of a peace refus'd  Of violated leagues and broken faith  Astraea shall return to bless our isle  And a new Athens in Britannia rise  PSALM CIV  IMITATED BY MR THO BLACKLOCK  A Rise my soul on wings seraphic rise  And praise th' Almighty Sovereign of the skies  In whom alone essential glory shines  Which not the heaven of heavens nor boundless space confines  When darkness rul'd with universal sway  He spoke and kindled up the blaze of day  First fairest offspring of th' omnific word  Which like a garment cloath'd its sovereign lord  He stretch'd the blue expanse from pole to pole  And spread circumfluent ether round the whole  Of liquid air he bade the columns rise  Which prop the starry concave of the skies  Soon as he bids impetuous whirlwinds fly  To bear his sounding chariot thro' the sky  Impetuous whirlwinds the command obey  Sustain his flight and sweep th' aerial way  Fraught with his mandates from the realms on high  Unnumber'd hosts of radiant heralds fly  From orb to orb with progress unconfin'd  As lightning swift resistless as the wind  His word in air this ponderous ball sustain'd  " Be fixt" he saidand fixt the ball remain'd  Heaven air and sea tho' all their storms combine  Shake not its base nor break the law divine  At thy almighty voice old ocean raves  Wakes all his force and gathers all his waves  Nature lies mantled in a watery robe  And shoreless ocean rolls around the globe  O'er highest hills the higher surges rise  Mix with the clouds and lave the vaulted skies  But when in thunder the rebuke was given  That shook th' eternal firmament of heaven  The dread rebuke the frighted waves obey  They fled confus'd along th' appointed way  Impetuous rushing to the place decreed  Climb the steep hill and sweep the humble mead  And now reluctant in their bounds subside  Th' eternal bounds restrain the raging tide  Yet still tumultuous with incessant roar  It shakes the caverns and assaults the shore  By him from mountains cloath'd in lucid snow  Thro' verdant vales the mazy fountains flow  Here the wild horse unconscious of the rein  That revels boundless o'er the wide campaign  Imbibes the silver stream with heat opprest  To cool the fervor of his glowing breast  Here verdant boughs adorn'd with summer's pride  Spread their broad shadows o'er the silver tide  While gently perching on the leafy spray  Each feather'd songster tunes his various lay  And while thy praise they symphonize around  Creation echoes to the grateful sound  Wide o'er the heavens the various bow he bends  Its tincture brightens and its arch extends  At the glad sign aerial conduits flow  The hills relent the meads rejoice below  By genial fervor and prolific rain  Gay vegetation cloaths the fertile plain  Nature profusely good with bliss o'erflows  And still she's pregnant tho' she still bestows  Here verdant pastures far extended lie  And yield the grazing herd a rich supply  Luxuriant waving in the wanton air  Here golden grain rewards the peasant's care  Here vines mature in purple clusters glow  And heaven above diffuses heaven below  Erect and tall here mountaincedars rise  High o'er the clouds and emulate the skies  Here the wing'd crouds that skim the yielding air  With artful toil their little domes prepare  Here hatch their young and nurse their rising care  Up the steep hill ascends the nimble doe  While timid conies scour the plains below  Or in the pendent rock elude the scenting foe  He bade the silver majesty of night  Revolve her circle and increase her light  Assign'd a province to each rolling sphere  And taught the sun to regulate the year  At his command widehovering o'er the plain  Primeval night resumes her gloomy reign  Then from their dens impatient of delay  The savage monsters bend their speedy way  Howl thro' the spacious waste and chase the frighted prey  Here walks the shaggy monarch of the wood  Taught from thy providence to ask his food  To thee O Father to thy bounteous skies  He rears his mane and rolls his glaring eyes  He roars the deserts tremble wide around  And repercussive hills repeat the sound  Now glowing gems the eastern skies adorn  And joyful nature hails the opening morn  The rovers conscious of approaching day  Fly to their shelters and forget their prey  Laborious man with moderate slumber blest  Springs cheerful to his toil from downy rest  Till grateful evening with her silver train  Bids labour cease and ease the weary swain  Hail sovereign goodness all productive mind  On all thy works thyself inscrib'd we find  How various all how variously endued  How great their number and each part how good  How perfect then must the great parent shine  Who with one act of energy divine  Laid the vast plan and finish'd the design  Wheree'er the pleasing search my thoughts pursue  Unbounded goodness opens to my view  Nor does our world alone its influence share  Exhaustless bounty and unwearied care  Extend thro' all th' infinity of space  And circle nature with a kind embrace  The wavy kingdoms of the deep below  Thy power thy wisdom and thy goodness show  Here various beings without number stray  Croud the profound or on the surface play  Leviathan here the mightiest of the train  Enormous sails incumbent o'er the main  And foams and sports and plays in spite of man  All these thy watchful providence supplies  To thee alone they turn their waiting eyes  For them thou openest thy exhaustless store  Till the capacious wish can grant no more  But if one moment thou thy face should'st hide  Thy glory clouded or thy smiles denied  Then widow'd nature veils her mournful eyes  And vents her grief in universal cries  Then gloomy death with all his meagre train  Wide o'er the nations spreads his iron reign  Sea earth and air the boundless ravage mourn  And all their hosts to native dust return  Again thy glorious quickening influence shed  The glad creation rears her drooping head  New rising forms thy potent smiles obey  And life rekindles at the genial ray  United thanks replenish'd nature pays  And heaven and earth resound their Maker's praise  When time shall in eternity be lost  And hoary nature languish into dust  For ever young thy glories shall remain  Vast as thy being endless as thy reign  Thou from the reign of everlasting day  Seest all thy works at one immense survey  Pleas'd at one view the whole to comprehend  Part join'd to part concurring to one end  If thou to earth but turn'st thy wrathful eyes  Her basis trembles and her offspring dies  Thou smit'st the hills and at th' almighty blow  Their summits kindle and their entrails glow  While this immortal spark of heavenly flame  Distends my breast and animates my frame  To thee my ardent praises shall be born  On the first breeze that wakes the blushing morn  The latest star shall hear the pleasing sound  And nature in full choir shall join around  When full of thee my soul excursive flies  Thro' earth air ocean or thy regal skies  From world to world new wonders still I find  And all the Godhead bursts upon my mind  When wing'd with whirlwinds Vice shall take her flight  To the wide bosom of eternal night  To thee my soul shall endless praises pay  oin men and angels join th' exalted lay  TO CHARITY  DElightful sovereign of the cheerful smile  Save when thy eye pours forth the streaming tear  Compassionate as oft it doth when Want  In pensive mood and tatter'd garb appears  Where shall I find thee for thy sacred step  The power of secrecy attends and guards  O fortune fortune wherefore not to me  Devolves thy golden tide to me whose hand  Would turn thy flood into a thousand rills  Why on the barren rock and niggard heath  Plays thy favonian breeze why shines thy sun  To tip the dunghill with a beam of gold  Why dost thou stretch thy treasureladen hand  To those of no desert you sordid wretch  Of narrow soul behold on whom thy gifts  Are lavish'd bountiful behold and blush  He shuts them from the light nor heeds the cry  Of helpless orphans as before his door  They kneel imploring with distressful tears  Softening the rude hard flint His harder heart  Feels no emotion for another's woe  If in the world to come severest pangs  Spontaneous crimes await how much will mourn  Beings unsocial unbenevolent  This principle allies us to the stars  Its nonexertion where the power is given  Looks hateful to divine and human view  And yet how dances yonder miser's heart  Ignoble what from Charity he holds  He deems oeconomy and hugs the thought  Of posthumous applause if by his will  He gives the public what he cannot keep  Oh vanity of fame I'd rather lie  Tomb'd in oblivion ere I'd have my name  Engrav'd immortal on so low a base  Wretch as thou art'tis ostentation all  A pride which gnaws thy vitals up and turns  " The milk of human kindness" into gall  Queen of the liberal vast extensive thought  Sweet Charity oh lead me to the cell  Where haggard famine o'er her dying race  Sits weeping while on her uncover'd breast  The cold rain beatsthere let me see thy hand  Raise her dejected head and give the means  Of present comfort to her sobbing soul  So shall my tears convince thee that my heart  Is prone to pity tho' I can't relieve  WW  THE COMPLAINT A PASTORAL ELEGY  THE sun diffusing genial fires  With flowers bedecks the dale  With joy the herd and flock inspires  With music fills the gale  Yet he renews his warmth in vain  And flowerets paint the ground  Or lambkins gambol o'er the plain  Or songsters chant around  To me in vain doth nature smile  In vain her charms display  Whilst I with neverending toil  Consume the livelong day  Time was I've hail'd the vernal powers  Flush'd with the general joy  When tepid gleams and gentle showers  Have brighten'd earth and sky  Have trod with glee the velvet green  That rob'd the laughing earth  And eyed the universal scene  Or mark'd each floweret's birth  When snowdrops first in silver drest  Shot forth their daring head  Or when the violet's sapphire vest  A fragrant incense shed  Or starry pilewort's polish'd hue  Besprig'd the fields with gold  Or daisies pied or harebells blue  Or truelove's verdant fold  Yet not with dull lethargic gaze  I view'd fair nature's face  The florid earth the solar blaze  And vast etherial space  For who that sees this beauteous frame  Replete with wonder shine  But must with ready voice proclaim  A plastic Power divine  Or in the deep sequester'd grove  From care and business freed  Have sought the sacred muse's love  And tun'd my rustic reed  Or by some fountain laid along  That winds around the trees  With raptures heard the woodland song  Or breath'd the scented breeze  Or stretch'd upon the mountain's steep  In Phoebus' drowsy beams  Have pass'd the hours in gentle sleep  Or wild romantic dreams  And oft with sweet Benevolence  A heavendescended fair  Have sacrific'd the sweets of sense  Sublimer joys to share  With her to range the thorny shade  Or climb the steepy hill  Or search the field or marshy glade  Or trace the mazy rill  With care to cull each healing plant  And every balmy bloom  And where disease and pining want  Combin'd their horrid gloom  There to dispense their cheering aids  In each distressful cot  Where feeble swains or pallid maids  Bemoan'd their dreary lot  But ah the herbs the flowers I seek  With curious eye no more  No more they flush the haggard cheek  Or blooming health restore  Nor healthful tincture they disclose  Nor cordial draught supply  But on the spot from whence they rose  They blossom fade and die  Erewhile with Daphne in my arms  The time transported flew  When doating on her lovely charms  Which nature's pencil drew  But now my scanty view's confin'd  To Daphne's charms alone  Since Hymen's rites with Love combin'd  And made her all my own  Save what my little babes afford  Whom I behold with glee  When smiling at my humble board  Or prattling on my knee  Not that I Daphne's charms despise  Which still new pleasures bring  Her lovely presence never cloys  She's grateful as the spring  The dewdrop sparkling on its bed  In Daphne's eyes exprest  Her cheeks outshine the campion's red  The daisy's white her breast  Her hair outvies the saffron morn  Her soft mellifluent note  The thrush that on the leafy thorn  Distends his vocal throat  Nor wish I dear connubial state  To break thy silken bands  I only blame relentless fate  That every hour demands  Nor mourn I much my task austere  Which endless wants impose  Butoh it wounds my heart to hear  My Daphne's melting woes  Ixionlike her fate she moans  Whose wheel rolls ceaseless round  While hollow sighs and doleful groans  Fill all the dark profound  For oft she sighs and oft she weeps  And hangs her pensive head  While blood her furrow'd fingers steeps  And stains the passing thread  When orient hills the sun behold  Our labours are begun  And when he streaks the west with gold  The task is still undone  My harmless lambs may ye ne'er feel  Such dire oppressive need  While Poverty with rod of steel  Still urges swifter speed  How happy are the beasts and birds  Who find their food unsought  Kind nature all their wants affords  Without one anxious thought  The beasts in freedom range the fields  Nor care nor sorrow know  Their meat the tender herbage yields  The fountains drink bestow  Each hour the birds with sprightly voice  In rival songs contend  Or o'er their bounteous meals rejoice  Or in fond dalliance spend  But foresight warns me not to taste  The bliss which heaven design'd  But joyless all my nights to waste  To shun more woes behind  Oh heaven why didst thou reason give  To curb th' impassion'd soul  Why did I not by instinct live  And act without controul  Or why within this tortur'd heart  Must keen reflection dwell  To double every present smart  And future pains foretell  But ah vile wretch no longer blame  What gracious heaven decreed  Nor thus with petulance disclaim  Allpatient virtue's meed  I'll rather now with filial fear  Adore the present God  And his paternal stripes revere  And kiss his healing rod  For his blest providence withstood  I counteract his will  And what his wisdom meant for good  My folly construes ill  Who knows but liberty and wealth  Might work a woeful change  With luxury might impair my health  Or virtuous thoughts estrange  What I detest he gives in love  In love my suit denies  Or oft my wish my bane might prove  My bliss what I despise  Then let not my presumptuous mind  Oppose his love or might  For well has moral Pope defin'd  " Whatever is is right"  But let me not from hence surmise  That human ills descend  From him who only good and wise  Is man's eternal friend  No we transgressing nature's laws  Nature's great God arraign  While man's himself the chiefest cause  Of all his grief and pain  Tho' now with penury opprest  I give my sorrows vent  He soon may calm my troubled breast  Or sooth my discontent  Come reason then bid murmuring cease  And intellectual strife  Come smiling hope and doveeyed peace  And still the storms of life  My little skiff kind pilots steer  Adown the stream of time  And teach me melancholic fear  And dark distrust's a crime  For has not truth's unerring sire  Who all our wants must know  Proclaim'd what nature can require  His bounty shall bestow  He feeds the birds that wing their flight  Along the passive air  And lillies bloom in glossy white  Beneath his fostering care  Nor accident nor fate recalls  The life that he has lent  For not a single sparrow falls  Without his kind assent  And should stern penury's murky train  Still haunt my lowly cell  Yet faith shall smile away my pain  And all their threatenings quell  For when thro' ether's boundless space  This terrene orb has run  A few more times his annual race  Wide circling round the sun  Or haply ere the day be past  And evening shades descend  My wearied heart may pant its last  And all my sorrows end  Then shall the disembodied soul  Resign her dark domain  And range where countless systems roll  And springs eternal reign  Yet not in solitude to soar  But with a kindred band  The power and wisdom to explore  Of her Creator's hand  Or with her tuneful powers compleat  To chant the bliss above  Or in extatic notes repeat  Her dear Redeemer's love  TRUTH AT COURT  BY A REV DEAN  NOW fye upon't quoth Flattery  These are bad times indeed

fill'st all space all beauteous every where  Thy rising sun with blushes paints the morn  Thy shining lamps the face of night adorn  Thy flowers the meads thy nodding trees the hills  The vales thy pastures green and bubbling rills  Thy coral groves thy rocks that amber weep  Deck all the gloomy mansions of the deep  Thy yellow sands distinct with golden ore  And these thy variegated shells the shore  To all thy works such grandeur hast thou lent  And such extravagance of ornament  For the false traytor man this pomp and show  A scene so gay for us poor worms below  Nofor thy glory all these beauties rise  Yet may improve the good instruct the wise  You madam sprung from Beaufort's royal line  Who lost to courts can in your closet shine  Best know to use each blessing he bestows  Best know to praise the power from whence it flows  Shells in your hand the Parian rock defy  Or agat or Aegyptian porphyry  More glossy they their veins of brighter dye  See where your rising pyramids aspire  Your guests surpriz'd the shining pile admire  In future times if some great Phidias rise  Whose chissel with his mistress Nature vies  Who with superior skill can lightly trace  In the hard marble block the softest face  To crown this piece so elegantly neat  Your wellwrought busto shall the whole compleat  O'er your own work from age to age preside  Its author once and then its greatest pride  EPISTLE TO MR THOMSON ON THE FIRST EDITION OF HIS SEASONS  BY THE SAME  SO bright so dark upon an April day  The sun darts forth or hides his various ray  So high so low the lark aspiring sings  Or drops to earth again with folded wings  So smooth so rough the sea that laves our shores  Smiles in a calm or in a tempest roars  Believe me Thomson 'tis not thus I write  Severely kind by envy sour'd or spite  Nor would I rob thy brows to grace my own  Such arts are to my honest soul unknown  I read thee over as a friend should read  Griev'd when you fail o'erjoy'd when you succeed  Why should thy muse born so divinely fair  Want the reforming toilet's daily care  Dress the gay maid improve each native grace  And call forth all the glories of her face  Studiously plain and elegantly clean  With unaffected speech and easy mien  Th' accomplish'd nymph in all her best attire  Courts shall applaud and prostrate crowds admire  Discreetly daring with a stiffen'd rein  Firm in thy seat the flying steed restrain  Tho' few thy faults who can perfection boast  Spots in the sun are in his lustre lost  Yet even those spots expunge with patient care  Nor fondly the minutest error spare  For kind and wise the parent who reproves  The slightest blemish in the child he loves  Read Philips much consider Milton more  But from their dross extract the purer ore  To coin new words or to restore the old  In southern bards is dangerous and bold  But rarely very rarely will succeed  When minted on the other side of Tweed  Let perspicuity o'er all preside  Soon shalt thou be the nation's joy and pride  The rhiming jingling tribe with bells and song  Who drive their limping Pegasus along  Shall learn from thee in bolder flights to rise  To scorn the beaten road and range the skies  A genius so refin'd so just so great  In Britain's isle shall fix the muses seat  And new Parnassus shall at home create  Rules from thy works each future bard shall draw  Thy works above the critic's nicer law  And rich in brilliant gems without a flaw  AN EPISTLE TO LORD COBHAM  BY MR CONGREVE  SIncerest critic of my prose or rhime  Tell how thy pleasing Stow employs thy time  Say Cobham what amuses thy retreat  Or schemes of war or stratagems of state  Dost thou recall to mind with joy or grief  Great Marlbro's actions that immortal chief  Whose slightest trophies rais'd in each campaign  More than suffic'd to signalize a reign  Doth thy remembrance rising warm thy heart  With glories past where thou thyself hadst part  Or dost thou grieve indignant now to see  The fruitless end of all thy victory  To see th' audacious foe so late subdued  Dispute those terms for which so long they sued  As if Britannia now were sunk so low  To beg that peace she wonted to bestow  Be far that guilt be never known such shame  That England should retract her rightful claim  Or ceasing to be dreaded and ador'd  Stain with the pen the lustre of the sword  Or dost thou fix thy mind on rural scenes  To turn the levell'd lawns to liquid plains  To raise the creeping rills from humble beds  And force the latent springs to lift their heads  On watery columns capitals to rear  That mix their flowing curls with upper air  Or dost thou weary grown these works neglect  No temples statues obelisks erect  But seek the morning breeze from fragrant meads  Or shun the noontide sun in wholesome shades  Or slowly walk along the mazy wood  To meditate on all that's great and good  For nature bountiful in thee hath join'd  A pleasing person with a worthy mind  Nor given thee form alone but means and art  To draw the eye and to allure the heart  Poor were the praise in fortune to excell  Yet want the means to use that fortune well  While thus adorn'd while thus with virtue crown'd  At home in peace abroad in arms renown'd  Graceful in form and winning in address  While well you think what aptly you express  While health with honour with a fair estate  A table free and elegantly neat  What can be added more of mortal bliss  What can he want who stands possest of this  What can the fondest wishing mother more  Of heaven attentive for her son implore  And yet an happiness remains unknown  Or to philosophy reveal'd alone  A precept which unpractis'd renders vain  Thy glowing hopes and pleasure turns to pain  Should hope or fear thy breast alternate tear  Or love or hate or rage or anxious care  Whatever passions may thy mind infest  And where's the mind that passions ne'er molest  Amid the pangs of such intestine strife  Still think the present day the last of life  Defer not till tomorrow to be wise  Tomorrow's sun to thee may never rise  Or should tomorrow chance to cheer thy sight  With her enlivening and unlook'd for light  How grateful will appear her dawning rays  As favours unexpected doubly please  Who thus can think and who such thoughts pursues  Content may keep his life or calmly lose  Of this a proof thou mayst thyself receive  When leisure from affairs will give thee leave  Come see thy friend retir'd without regret  Forgetting cares or trying to forget  In easy contemplation soothing time  With morals much and now and then with rhime  Not so robust in body as in mind  And always undejected tho' declin'd  Not wondering at the world's new wicked ways  Compar'd with those of our forefather's days  For virtue now is neither more nor less  And vice is only varied in the dress  Believe it men have ever been the same  And all the golden age is but a dream  ON THE DSS OF RD  BY LD CHD  WHat do scholars and bards and astronomers wife  Mean by stuffing our heads with nonsense and lies  By telling us Venus must always appear  In a car or a shell or a twinkling star  Drawn by sparrows or swans or dolphins or doves  Attended in form by the graces and loves  That ambrosia and nectar is all she will taste  And her passport to hearts on a belt round her waist  Without all this bustle I saw the bright dame  To supper last night to Py's she came  In a good warm sedan no fine open car  Two chairmen her doves and a flambeau her star  No nectar she drank no ambrosia she eat  Her cup was plain claret a chicken her meat  Nor wanted a cestus her bosom to grace  For Rd that night had lent her her face  AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND IN TOWN  BY THE LATE MR DYER  HAve my friends in the town in the busy gay town  Forgot such a man as John Dyer  Or heedless despise they or pity the clown  Whose bosom no pageantries fire  No matter no mattercontent in the shades  Contentedwhy every thing charms me  Fall in tunes all adown the green steep ye cascades  Till hence rigid virtue alarms me  Till outrage arises or misery needs  The swift the intrepid avenger  Till sacred religion or liberty bleeds  Then mine be the deed and the danger  Alas what a folly that wealth and domain  We heap up in sin and in sorrow  Immense is the toil yet the labour how vain  Is not life to be over tomorrow  Then glide on my moments the few that I have  Smoothshaded and quiet and even  While gently the body descends to the grave  And the spirit arises to heaven  THE XXXTH IDYLLIUM OF THEOCRITUS TRANSLATED  ON THE DEATH OF ADONIS  WHen Venus saw Adonis dead  And from his cheeks the roses fled  His lovely locks distain'd with gore  She bade her Cupids bring the boar  The boar that had her lover slain  The cause of all her grief and pain  Swift as the pinion'd birds they rove  Thro' every wood thro' every grove  And when the guilty boar they found  With cords they bound him doubly bound  One with a chain secure and strong  Haul'd him unwillingly along  One pinch'd his tail to make him go  Another beat him with his bow  The more they urg'd the more they dragg'd  The more reluctantly he lagg'd  Guilt in his conscious looks appear'd  He much the angry goddess fear'd  To Venus soon the boar they led  " O cruel cruel beast she said  " Durst thou that thigh with blood distain  " Hast thou my dearest lover slain"  Submissive he repliesI swear  By thee fair queenby all that's dear  By thy fond loverby this chain  And by this numerous huntertrain  I ne'er design'd with impious tooth  To wound so beautiful a youth  Nobut with love and frenzy warm  So far has beauty power to charm  I long'd this crime I'll not deny  To kiss that fair that naked thigh  These tusks then punish if you please  These are offenders draw out these  Of no more use they now can prove  To me the votaries of love  My guilty lips if not content  My lips shall share the punishment  These words so movingly exprest  Infus'd soft pity in her breast  The queen relented at his plea  And bad her Cupids set him free  But from that day he join'd her train  Nor to the woods return'd again  And all those teeth he burnt with fire  Which glow'd before with keen desire  FF  ON THE MARRIAGE OF TAME AND ISIS  WHile thro' irriguous meads pleas'd Isis stray'd  Tame grew enamour'd of the watery maid  And stealing silent o'er the flowery ground  Threw his fond arms voluminous around  The virgin stream now melting soft and kind  And the pure waves in lasting union join'd  Their mingled currents now one bed contains  And leagued in love they wind along the plains  Tame loves whate'er sweet Isis can approve  And every object shares their mutual love  In sway united and their streams the same  In one fair flood they flow and Tamisis the name  IN AMOREM TAMI ET ISIDIS  Nympha Isis liquidos agros dum loeta pererrat  Incaluit madidae Tamus amore deae  Serpit amans tacitus sinnosaque brachia circum  Fundit et aeterno foedere jungit aquas  Nunc torrens idem et limes datur unus utrique  Nec doluere vices ille vel illa suas  Tamus amat quicquid sua dulcis amaverat Isis  Et quod Tamus amat Tamus et Isis amant  Jam nullam agnoscas Tami nullam Isidis undam  Communi imperium Tamisis unus habet  ON AMORET'S RECOVERY FROM A SEVERE FIT OF SICKNESS JUNE IV MDCCLXI  THus when bleak winds their baleful influence shed  The lovely lilly droops her languid head  Till cheer'd by Sol's invigorating power  More fair revives the animated flower  With you reviv'd we grateful tribute pay  And bless the god of med'cine and of day  Poean whose presence health to mortals brings  Rose on your bower with healing in his wings  And now rejoic'd we view all mild and meek  Beams in your eye and roses on your cheek  As from the furnace glows the golden ore  Refin'd by fire and brighter than before  So Amoret newclad in beauty's arms  Emerges irresistable in charms  Thus late I saw thro' Galileo's eyes  Venus the splendid star that gilds the skies  Immers'd within the sun's refulgent rim  Her beams were faded and her lustre dim  Soon with fresh radiance glow'd her lovely face  The pride of evening and the morning's grace  You now dear Amoret our lyres employ  Your late revival gives the public joy  No longer now your charms in shades you shroud  But rise a brighter Venus from the cloud  ON QUEEN CAROLINE'S REBUILDING THE LODGINGS OF THE BLACK PRINCE AND HENRY V AT QUEEN'S COLLEGE OXFORD  BY MR TICKELL  WHere bold and graceful soars secure of fame  The pile now worthy great Philippa's name  Mark that old ruin Gothic and uncouth  Where the Black Edward pass'd his beardless youth  And the Fifth Henry for his first renown  Outstripp'd each rival in a student's gown  In that coarse age were princes fond to dwell  With meagre monks and haunt the silent cell  Sent from the monarch's to the muse's court  Their meals were frugal and their sleeps were short  To couch at curfeutime they thought no scorn  And froze at mattins every winter morn  They read an early book the starry frame  And lisp'd each constellation by its name  Art after art still dawning to their view  And their mind opening as their stature grew  Yet whose ripe manhood spread our fame so far  Sages in peace and demigods in war  Who stern in fight made echoing Cressy ring  Yet mild in conquest serv'd his captive king  Who gain'd at Agincourt the victor's bays  Nor took himself but gave high heaven the praise  Thy nurslings antient dome to virtue form'd  To mercy listening whilst in fields they storm'd  Fierce to the fierce and warm th' oppress'd to save  Thro' life rever'd and worshipp'd in the grave  In tenfold pride their mouldering roofs shall shine  The stately work of royal Caroline  And blest Philippa with unenvying eyes  From heaven beheld her rival's fabric rise  If still bright saint this spot deserve thy care  Incline thee to th' ambitious muse's prayer  Oh could'st thou win young William's bloom to grace  His mother Wales and fill thy Edward's place  How would that genius whose propitious wings  Have here twice hover'd o'er the sons of kings  Descend triumphant to his antient seat  And take in charge a third Plantagenet  COLIN AND LUCY  A FRAGMENT  ON the banks of that crystalline stream  Where Thames oft his current delays  And charms more than poets can dream  In his Richmond's bright villa surveys  Fair Lucy of all the gay throng  The fairest that Britain has seen  Now drew every village along  From the day she first danc'd on the green  Ah boast not of beauty's fond power  For short is the triumph ye fair  Not fleeter the bloom of each flower  And hope is but gilded despair  His desire each swain now behold  By riches endeavours to prove  But Lucy still cries what is gold  Or wealth when compar'd to his love  No Colin together we'll wield  Our sickles in summer's bright day  Together we'll leaze o'er the field  And smile all our labours away  In winter I'll winnow the wheat  As it falls from your flail on the ground  That flail will be music as sweet  When your voice in the labour is drown'd  How oft would he speak of his bliss  How oft would he call her his maid  And Colin would seal with a kiss  Every promise and vow which he laid  But hark o'er the grasslevel land  The village bells sound on the plain  False Colin this morn gave his hand  And Lucy's fond tears are in vain  Sad Lucy too soon heard the tale  Too soon the sad cause she was told  That his was a nymph of the vale  That he broke his fond promise for gold  As she walkt by the margin so green  That adorns Thames' flowery side  How oft was she languishing seen  How oft would she gaze on the tide  By the clear mirror then as she sate  That reflected herself and the mead  Awhile she bewail'd her sad fate  And the green turf still pillow'd her head  There there is it Lucy I see  'Tis Lucy the lost undone maid  Ah no 'tis some Lucy like me  Some hapless young virgin betray'd  Like me she has sorrow'd and wept  Like me she has fondly believ'd  Like me her true promise she kept  And like me too is justly deceiv'd  I come dear companion in grief  Gay scenes and fond pleasures adieu  I come and we'll gather relief  From bosoms so chaste and so true  Like you I have mourn'd the long night  And wept out the day in despair  Like you I have banish'd delight  And bosom'd a friend in my care  Ye meadows so lovely farewell  Your velvet still Colin shall tread  All deaf to the sound of that knell  Which tolls for his Lucy when dead  Your wish will too sure be obey'd  Nor Colin her loss shall bemoan  Soon soon shall poor Lucy be laid  Where her heart shall be cold as your own  Then clasp'd in the arms of that fair  Whose wealth has been Lucy's sad fate  As together you breathe the free air  And a thousand dear pleasures relate  If chance o'er my turf as you tread  You dare to affect a fond sigh  The primrose will shrink its pale head  And the violet languish and die  Scarce echo had gather'd the sound  But she plung'd from her grassspringing bed  The liquid stream parts to the ground  And the mirror clos'd over her head  The swains of the village at eve  Oft meet at the darkspreading yew  There wonder how man could deceive  A bosom so chaste and so true  With garlands of every flower  Which Lucy herself should have made  They raise up a shortliving bower  And sighing cry peace to her shade  Then hand lock'd in hand as they move  The greenplatting hilloc around  They talk of sad Lucy and love  And freshen with tears the fair ground  Nay wish they had never been born  Or liv'd the sad moment to view  When a Colin could thus be forsworn  And a Lucy could still be so true  CONTENTS  MArch An ode Page  A vernal ode  An elegy on the approach of spring  Spring A rural song  The violet  The progress of poetry  To the memory of mr
