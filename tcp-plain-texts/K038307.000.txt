 THE INFLEXIBLE CAPTIVE  A TRAGEDY  BY Miss HANNAH MORE  The Man resolv'd and steady to his Trust  In flexible to ill and obstinately just  HORACE Book III Ode  DUBLIN Printed for J WILLIAMS No SKINNERROW MDCCLXXV  TO THE Honourable Mrs BOSCAWEN  MADAM  IT seems somewhat extraordinary that altho' with persons of merit no virtue stands in higher estimation than the love of truth yet the surest means to offend them in addrsses of this nature is a strict adherence to it and it will be a singular circumstance to see a Dedication without praise to a Lady possessed of every quality and accomplishment which can justly intitle her to it  I am  Madam  with great Respect Your most obedient And most humble Servant  H MORE  BRISTOL  March  THE ARGUMENT  AMONG the great names which have done honor to antiquity in general and to the Roman Republic in particular that of  Marcus Attilius Regulus  has by the general consent of all ages been considered as one of the most respectable since he not only sacrificed his labours his liberty and his life for the good of his country But by a greatness of soul almost peculiar to himself contrived to make his very misfortunes contribute to that glorious end  After the Romans had met with various successes in the first Punic War under the command of Regulus victory at length declared for the opposite party the Roman Army was totally overthrown and Regulus himself taken prisoner by  Xantippus  a Lacedoemonian General in the service of the Carthaginians the victorious enemy exulting in so important a conquest kept him many years in close imprisonment and loaded him with the most cruel Indignities They thought it was new in their power to make their own terms with Rome and determined to send Regulus thither with their Ambassador to negotiate a peace or at least an exchange of captives thinking be would gladly persuade his countrymen to discontinue a war which necessarily prolonged his captivity They previously exacted from him an oath to return should his embassy prove unsuccessful at the same time giving him to understand that he must expect to suffer a cruel death if he failed in it this they artfully intimated as the strongest motive for him to leave no means unattempted to accomplish their purpose  At the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero the Romans express'd the wildest transports of joy and would have submitted to almost any conditions to procure his enlargement  but Regulus so far from availing himself of his influence with the Senate to obtain any personal advantages employed it to induce them to reject proposals so evidently tending to dishonour their country declaring his fixed resolution to return to bondage and death rather than violate his cath  He at Last extorted from them their consent and departed amidst the tears of his family the importunities of his friends the applauses of the Senate and the tumultuous opposition of the people and as a great poet of his own nation beautifully observes  he embarked for Carthage as calm and unconcerned as if on finishing the tedious lawsuits of his clients he was retiring to Vena  rian fields or the sweet country of  Tarentum  HOR Book III Ode  In the above and many other important particulars the Author has paid the strictest regard to historical truth In some less essential points where she thought it would rather obstruct than advance her purpose she has ventured to deviate from it particularly in fixing the return of Regulus to Rome posterior to the death of his wife Martia In  this  and in the  general  conduct of the story she has followed the Italian poet Metastasio in his Opera of  three  acts of which she has given a free translation and made such  additions  as were necessary to form it into a tragedy of  five  acts  PROLOGUE  BY THE REV DR LANGHORNE  DEEP in the bosom of departed days  Where the first gems of human glory blaze  Where crown'd with flowers in wreaths immortal drest  The sacred shades of ancient virtue rest  With joy they search who joy can feel to find  Some honest reason still to love mankind  There the fair foundress of the scene to night  Explores the paths that dignify delight  The regions of the mighty dead pervades  The sybil she that leads us to the shades  O may each blast of ruder breath forbear  To wast her light leaves on the worthless air  Since she as heedless strives not to maintain  This tender offspring of her teeming brain  For this poor birth was no provision made  A flower that sprung and languish'd in the shade  On Avon's banks forsaken and forlorn  This careless mother left her elder born  And tho' unlike that Avon hail'd of yore  Those giant sons that Shakespeare's banners bore  Yet may we yield this little offspring grace  And love the last and least of such a race  Shall the strong scenes where senatorial Rome  Mourn'd o'er the rigour of her patriot's doom  Where melting nature aw'd by virtue's eye  Hid the big drop and held the bursting sigh  Where all that Majesty of soul can give  Truth honor pity fair affection live  Shall scenes like these the glory of an age  Gleam from the press nor triumph on the stage  Forbid it Britons and as Romans brave  Like Romans boast one citizen to save  Dramatis Personae  MEN  REGULUS  PUBLIUS his Son  MANLIUS the Consul  LICINIUS a Tribune  HAMILCAR the Carthaginian Ambass  WOMEN  ATTILIA Daughter of Regulus  BARCE a Carthaginian Captive  Guards Lictors People c  SCENE near the Gates of  ROME  THE INFLEXIBLE CAPTIVE  A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE  a Hall in the Consul's Palace  Enter  LICINIUS ATTILIA  Lictors and People  Licin  AH my Attilia do I find thee here  Is this a place for Regulus's daughter  Just Gods must that incomparable maid  Associate here with Lictors and Plebeians  Attil  Yes on this threshold patiently I wait  The Consul's coming I would make him blush  To see me here his suitor O Licinius  This is no time for form and cold decorum  Five lagging years have crept their tedious round  And Regulus alas is still a slave  A wretched slave unpitied and forgotten  No other tribute paid his memory  Than the sad tears of his unhappy child  If  she  be silent who will speak for Regulus  Licin  Let not her sorrows make my Fair unjust  Is there in Rome a heart so dead to virtue  That does not beat in Regulus's cause  That wearies not the Gods for his return  That does not think all subjugated Afric  A slender unimportant acquisition  If in return for all this added empire  The freedom of thy father be the purchase  These are  Rome  's feelings for my lov'd Attilia  If were superfluous to declare  my own  If thy  Licinius  were to weigh his merit  That he's  thy father  were sufficient glory  He was my leader train'd me up to arms  And if I boast some sparks of Roman honor  I owe them to his precepts and  his  virtues  Attil  And yet I have not aught observ'd Licinius  Licin  Ah spare me thy reproacheswhat could I  When but a private Citizen perform  'Tis not the lust of power or pride of rank  Has made me seek the dignity of Tribune  No my Attilia but I fondly hop'd  'Twould strengthen and inforce the just request  Which as a  private  man I  vainly  made  But now the people's representative  I shall  demand  Attilia to be heard  Attil  Ah let us not too hastily apply  This dang'rous remedy I would not rouse  Fresh tumults 'twixt the people and the senate  Each views with jealousy the idol power  Which each possessing would alike abuse  Whatever wish'dfor boon the  one  demands  The  other  thro' reluctant pride denies  Might  I  advise you try a  gentler  method  I know that every moment Rome expects  Th' Ambassador of Carthage and I've heard  The Conscript Fathers are already met  To give him audience in Bellona's temple  There might the Consul at my suit Licinius  Propose the ransom of my captive father  Licin  Ah think Attilia who that Consul is  Manlius thy father's rival and his foe  His ancient rival and his foe prosess'd  To hope in him my fair were fond delusion  Attil  Yet tho' his  rival  Manlius is a  Roman  Nor will he think of private enmities  Weigh'd in the balance with the good of Rome  Let me at least make trial of his honour  Licin  Be it so my fair but  elsewhere  make thy suit  Let not the Consul meet Attilia  here  Confounded with the refuse of the people  Attil  Yes I will see him  here  e'en  here  Licinius  Let  Manlius  blush not  me Here  will I speak  Here  shall he answer me  Licin  Behold he comes  Attil  Do thou retire  Licin  O bless me with a look  One parting look at least  Attil  Know my Licinius  That at this moment I am all the  daughter  The  filial  feelings  now  possess my soul  And  other  passions find no entrance there  Licin  O sweet yet powerful influence of virtue  That charms tho' cruel tho' unkind subdues  And what was love exalts to admiration  Yes 'tis the privilege of souls like thine  To conquer most when least they aim at conquest  Yet ah vouchsafe thou noblest among women  Sometimes to think with pity on Licinius  Nor fear to rob thy father of his due  For surely Virtue and the Gods approve  Unwearied constancy and spotless love  Exit  Licinius  Enter  MANLIUS  Attil  Ah Manlius stay a moment stay and hear me  Manl  I did not think to meet thee here Attilia  Here in a place so little worthy of thee  Attil  It  were  unworthy did Attilia boast  A godlike father free from cruel bondage  But for the daughter of a slave to Carthage  It surely is most sitting  Manl  Say Attilia  What is the purpose of thy coming hither  Attil  What is the purpose patience patience  Heaven  Tell me how long to Rome's eternal shame  To fill with horror all the wond'ring world  My father still must groan in Punic chains  And waste the tedious hours in sad captivity  Days follow days and years to years succeed  And Rome forgets her hero is a slave  Has he alas  deserv'd  to be forgotten  What is his crime is it to have preferr'd  His country's profit to his children's good  Is it th' unshaken firmness of his soul  Just uncorrupt invariably good  Perhaps his  pov'erty  has been his fault  Poor  in the highest dignities of  Rome  Illustrious error glorious poverty  Manl  But know Attilia  Attil  Yet awhile attend  And can ungrateful  Rome  so soon forget  Can those who breathe the air  he  breath'd forget  The great the godlike virtues of my father  There's not  a part  of Rome but speaks his praise  The  streets  thro' them the  hero  pass'd triumphant  The  Forum  there the  Legislator  plann'd  The wisest wholsomest and purest laws  The  Senatehouse  there spoke the  patriot Roman  There oft' his voice secur'd the public safety  The wisdom of his councils match'd his valor  Enter the  Temples  mount the  Capitol    And tell me Manlius to what hand but  his  They owe their trophies and their ornaments  Their foreign banners and their boasted ensigns  Tarentine Punic and Sicilian spoils  Nay ev'n those Lictors who precede thy steps  This Consul's purple which invests thy limbs  All all were Regulus's were my father's  And yet this hero this exalted patriot  This man of virtue this immortal Roman  In base requital for his services  Is left to linger out a life in chains  No honors paid him but a daughter's tears  O Rome O Regulus O thankless Citizens  Manl  Just are thy tearsThy father well deserves them  But know thy censure is unjust Attilia  The fate of Regulus is felt by all  We know and mourn the cruel woes he suffers  From barbarous Carthage  Attil  Manlius you mistake  Alas it is not Carthage which is barbarous  'Tis Rome ungrateful Rome is the Barbarian  Carthage but punishes a foe profess'd  But Rome betrays her hero and her father  Carthage remembers how he slew her sons  But Rome forgets the blood he lost for  her  Carthage revenges an acknowledg'd foe  But Rome with basest perfidy rewards  The glorious hand that bound her brow with laurels  Which now is the barbarian Rome or Carthage  Manl  What can be done  Attil  Need I instruct you what  Convene the Senate let them strait propose  A ransom or exchange for Regulus  To Africa's Ambassador Do this  And heav'n's best blessings crown your days with peace  Manl  Thou speakest like a  daughter  I Attilia  Must as a  Consul  act I must consult  The good of Rome her glory her renown  Would it not tarnish her unspotted fame  To sue to Carthage on the terms thou wishest  Attil  Ah rather own thou art still my father's foe  Manl  Is it  my  fault Attilia if thy father  By Carthaginian power was overcome  Attil  Before that fatal period oft' he taught you  Manl  Farewel ere this the Senate is assembled  My presence is requir'dSpeak to the fathers  And try to soften  their  austerity  My  rigor they may render vain for know  I am Rome's  Consul  not her  King  Attilia  Exit  Manlius  with the Lictors c  Attil  alone  This flattering hope alas has prov'd abortive  One  Consul is our  foe  the  other absent  What shall the sad Attilia next attempt  Shall I then try for  popular  assistance  Ah my unhappy father on what hazards  What strange vicissitudes what various turns  Thy life thy liberty thy all depends  Enter  BARCE  in haste  Ah my Attilia  Attil  Whence this eager haste  Barce  Th' Ambassador of Carthage is arriv'd  Attil  And why does  that  excite such wondrous transport  Barce  I bring  another  cause of greater still  Attil  Name it my Barce  Barce  Regulus  comes with him  Attil  My father can it be  Barce  Thy fatherRegulus  Attil  Thou art deceiv'd or thou deceiv'st thy friend  Barce  Indeed I saw him not but every tongue  Speaks the glad tidings  Enter  PUBLIUS  Attil  See where Publius comes  Pub  My sister I'm transported Oh Attilia  He's here our fatherRegulus is come  Attil  I thank you Gods O my full heart where is he  Hasten my brother lead O lead me to him  Pub  It is too soon restrain thy fond impatience  With Africa's Ambassador he waits  Until th' assembled senate give him audience  Attil  Where was he Publius when thou saw'st him first  Pub  You know in quality of Roman Quaestor  My duty 'tis to find a fit abode  For all Ambassadors of foreign states  Hearing the Carthaginian was arriv'd  I hasten'd to the port when O just Gods  No foreigner no foe no African  Salutes my eye but Regulusmy father  Attil  Oh mighty joy too exquisite delight  What said the hero tell me tell me all  And ease my anxious breast  Pub  Ere I arriv'd  My father stood already on the shore  Fixing his eyes with anxious eagerness  As straining to descry the Capitol  I saw and flew with transport to embrace him  Pronounc'd with wildest joy the name of father  With reverence seiz'd his venerable hand  And wou'd have kiss'd it when the awful hero  With that stern grandeur which made Carthage tremble  Drew backstood all collected in himself  And said austerely know thou rash young man  That  slaves  in  Rome  have not the rights of  fathers  Then ask'd if yet the senate was assembled  And  where  which having heard without indulging  The fond effusions of his soul or mine  He suddenly retir'd I flew with speed  To find the Consul but as yet success  Attends not my pursuit Direct me to him  Barce  Publius you'll find him in Bellona's temple  Attil  Then Regulus returns to Rome a slave  Pub  Yes but be comforted I know he brings  Proposals for a peace his will's his fate  Attil  Rome may perhaps refuse to treat of peace  Pub  Did'st thou behold the universal joy  At his return thou would'st not  doubt  my sister  There's not a man you meet but wild with transport  Proclaims aloud that Regulus is come  The streets are fill'd with thronging multitudes  Pressing with eager gaze to catch a look  The happy man who can descry him first  Points him to his next neighbour  he  to  his  Then what a thunder of applause goes round  What music to the ear of filial love  Attilia there was not a Roman eye  But shed pure tears of exquisite delight  Judge of  my  feelings by thy  own  my sister  By the large measure of thy fond affection  Attil  Where is Licinius find him out my Brother  My joy is incompleat till he partakes it  When doubts and fears have rent my anxious heart  In all my  woes  he kindly bore a part  Felt all my sorrows with a soul sincere  Sigh'd as I sigh'd and number'd tear for tear  Now favouring Heav'n my ardent vows has blest  He shall divide the  transports  of my breast  Exit Attilia  Pub  Barce adieu  Barce  Publius a moment hear me  Know'st thou the name of Africa's Ambassador  Pub  Hamilcar  Barce  Son of Hanno  Pub  Yes the same  Barce  Ah me my loverHow shall I support it  Aside  Pub  Ah charming maid the blood forsakes thy cheek  Is he the rival of thy Publius speak  And tell me all the rigor of my fate  Barce  Hear me my lord Since I have been thy slave  Thy goodness and the friendship of Attilia  Have soften'd all the horrors of my fate  'Till now I have not felt the weight of bondage  'Till nowah Publiusthink me not ungrateful  I would not wrong theeI will be sincere  I will expose the weakness of my soul  Know then my lordhow shall I tell thee all  Pub  Stop cruel maid nor wound thy Publius more  I dread the fatal frankness of thy words  Spare me the pain of knowing I am hated  And if thy heart's devoted to another  Yet do not tell it me in tender pity  Do not my fair dissolve the fond illusion  The dear delightful visions I have form'd  Of future joy and fond exhaustless love  Exit Publius  Barce  alone  And shall I see him then see my Hamilcar  Pride of my soul and lord of all my wishes  The only man in all our burning Afric  Who ever taught my bosom how to love  Down foolish heart be calm my busy thoughts  If at his  name  I feel these strange emotions  How shall I  see  how  meet  my conqueror  O let not those presume to talk of joy  Who ne'er have felt the pangs of deep distress  Such tender transport those alone can prove  Who long like me have known disastrous Love  The tears that fell the sighs that once were paid  Like grateful incense on his altar laid  The lambent flame now brighten not destroy  And woes remember'd turn to present joy  Exit  ACT II  Scene the Inside of the Temple of Bellona Seats for the Senators and Ambassadors Lictors guarding the Entrance  MANLIUS PUBLIUS  and  Senators  Manl  LET Regulus be sent for to our presence  And with him the Ambassador of Carthage  Is it then true the foe would treat of peace  Pub  They wish at least our captives were exchang'd  And send my father to declare their purpose  If he obtain it well if not then Regulus  Returns to meet the vengeance of the foe  And pay for your refusal with his blood  He ratified this treaty with his oath  And ere he quitted Carthage heard unmov'd

Should Rome refuse to treat with us of peace  Reg  What I have sworn I will fulfil Hamilcar  Be satisfied  Pub  Ye guardian Gods of Rome  Inspire his soul with your own eloquence  Reg  Carthage by me this embassy has sent  If Rome will leave her undisturb'd possession  Of all she now enjoys she offers  peace  But if you rather wish protracted war  Her next proposal is  exchange  of  captives    If you demand advice of  Regulus  Reject  them  both    Hamil  What dost thou mean  Pub  My father  Manl  Exalted fortitude I'm lost in wonder  Aside  Reg  Romans I will not idly spend my breath  To shew the dire effects of such a peace  The foes who beg it shew their dread of war  Manl  But the exchange of prisoners thou proposest  Reg  That artful scheme conceals some Punic fraud  Hamil  Roman beware hast thou so soon forgotten  Reg  I will fulfil the treaty I have sworn to  Pub  All will be ruin'd  Reg  Conscript fathers hear me  Tho' this exchange teems with a thousand ills  Yet 'tis th'  example  which alarms me most  This treaty fix'd Rome's honor is no more  Her fame her valor military pride  Her glory virtue fortitude all lost  Should her degenerate sons for recompence  Be promis'd life and liberty inglorious  What honest captive of them all would wish▪  With shame to enter her imperial gates  The servile scourge of slavery on his back  None none my friends would wish a fate so vile  But those base cowards who resign'd their arms  Unstain'd with hostile blood and poorly sued  Thro' ignominious fear of death for bondage  The scorn the laughter of th' insulting foe  O shame shame shame eternal infamy  Manl  However hurtful the  exchange  may be  The life and liberty of Regulus  More than compensate for it  Reg  Thou art mistaken  This Regulus is but a mortal man  Yielding apace to all th' infirmities  Of weak decaying natureI am old  Nor can my future feeble services  Assist my country much but know the young  Ferocious heroes you'd restore to Carthage  In lien of this old man are her chief bulwarks  In youth with wellstrung sinews this bold arm  Fought for my country fought and conquer'd for her  Now weak and nerveless let the foe possess it  Let Carthage have the poor the wretched triumph  To close these failing eyesbut O my Countrymen  Check their vain hopes and shew aspiring Afric  That heroes are the  common  growth of Rome  Manl  Unequall'd fortitude  Pub  O fatal virtue  Hamil  What do I hear this constancy confounds me  MANLIUS  to the  SENATORS  Let  honor  be the spring of all our actions  Not  interest  Fathers Honor

wretched privilege of breathing  Would force me to betray my  country  to them  Have these barbarians any tortures think you  To match the cruelty of such suspicions  Revenge me Fathers and I'm still a Roman  Arm arm yourselves prepare your Citizens  Rush eager onwards to the gates of Carthage  Snatch the imprison'd Eagles from their Fanes  Dye every Roman sword in Punic blood  And do such

Regulus I think the danger less  To lose th' advantage thy advice suggests  Than would accrue to Rome in losing thee  Whose wisdom might direct and valour guard her  A thirst for glory thou wouldst

 I find in  guilt  and  this  in  virtue  Were it not guilt guilt of the blackest dye  Even to  think  of freedom at th' expence  Of my dear bleeding country therefore life  And liberty wou'd be my  heaviest evils  But to  preserve  that country to  restore  her  To heal her wounds tho' at the price of  life  Is  virtue  therefore  servitude  and  death  Are Regulus  's good  his  wish  his  choice  Pub  Yet sure our country  Reg  is a  whole  my Publius  Of which we all are  parts  nor should a citizen  Regard  his  interests as distinct from  her's  No hopes or fears shou'd touch his

 To  her  he's bound for birth and education  Her  laws  secure him from  domestic  feuds  And from the  foreign  foe her  arms  protect him  She lends him honors dignity and rank  His wrongs revenges and his merit pays  And like a tender and indulgent mother  Loads him with comforts and wou'd make his state  As blest as nature and the Gods design'd it  Such gifts my son have their alloy of  pain  And let th' unworthy wretch who will not bear  His portion of the  public burthen  lose  Th'  advantages  it yieldslet him retire  From the dear blessings of a social life  Renounce the civiliz'd abodes of man  And with associate brutes a shelter seek  In horrid wilds and dens and dreary caves  And with their shaggy tenants share the spoil  Or if the savage hunters miss their prey  From scatter'd acorns pick a scanty meal  Far from the sweet civilities of life  There let him live and vaunt his wretched freedom  Pub  With reverence and astonishment I hear thee  Thy words my father

lest the Senate  Should doubt what answer to return to Carthage  O ye protecting deities of Rome  Ye guardian Gods look down propitious on her  Inspire her Senate with your sacred wisdom  And call up all that's Roman in their souls  Enter  MANLIUS  speaking  See that the lictors wait and guard the entrance  Take care that none intrude  Reg  Ah Manlius here  What can this mean  Manli  Where where is Regulus  The great the godlike the invincible  Oh let me strain the hero to my breast  Reg  avoiding him  Manlius stand off remember I'm a slave  And thou Rome's Consul  Manl  I am something  more  I am a man enamour'd of thy  virtues  Thy fortitude and courage have subdued me  I  was  thy  rival  I am  now  thy  friend  Allow me that distinction dearer far  Than all the honors Rome can give  without  it  Reg  This is the temper still of  noble  minds  And these the blessings of an humble fortune  Had I not been a  slave  I ne'er had gain'd  The treasure of thy friendship  Manl  I confess  Thy grandeur cast a veil before my eyes  Which thy reverse of fortune has remov'd  Oft have I seen thee on the day of triumph  A conqueror of  nations  enter Rome  Now thou hast conquer'd  fortune  and  thyself  Thy  laurels  oft have mov'd my soul to  envy  Thy  chains  awaken my  respect  and  reverence  Then  Regulus appear'd a  hero  to me  He rises  now  a  God  Reg  Manlius enough  Cease thy applause for praises such as thine  Might tempt the most severe and cautious virtue  Bless'd be the Gods who gild my latter days  With the bright glory of the Consul's friendship  Manl  Forbid it Jove said'st thou thy  latter  days  May gracious Heav'n to a far distant hour  Protract thy valued life Be it  my  care  To crown the hopes of thy admiring country  By giving back her long lost hero to her  I will exert my power to bring about  Th' exchange of captives Africa proposes  Reg  Manlius and is it  thus  is  this  the way  Thou dost  begin  to give me proofs of friendship  Ah if thy  love  be so destructive to me  Tell me alas what wou'd thy  hatred  be  Shall I then lose the  merit  of my sufferings  Be thus  defrauded  of the benefit  I vainly hop'd from all my years of  bondage  I did not come to shew my chains to Rome  To move my country to a weak compassion  I came to save her  honor  to preserve her  From tarnishing her glory by accepting  Proposals so injurious to her fame  O Manlius either give me proofs more worthy  A Roman's friendship or renew thy  hate  Manl  Dost thou not know that this exchange refus'd  Inevitable  death  must be thy fate  Reg  And has the name of  death  such terror in it  To strike with dread the mighty soul of Manlius  'Tis not  today  I learn that I am mortal  The foe can only take from Regulus  What wearied nature would have shortly yielded  It will be  now  a voluntary  gift  'Twould  then  become a necessary  tribute  Yes Manlius tell the world that as I  liv'd  For Rome alone when I cou'd live no longer  'Twas my last care how  dying  to assist  To  save  that  country  I had  liv'd  to  serve  Manl  O worth unparallel'd thrice happy Rome  Unequal'd in the heroes thou produced  Hast thou then sworn thou awfullygood man  Never to bless the Consul with thy friendship  Reg  If thou wilt love me love me like a  Roman  These are the terms on which I take thy friendship  We both must make a sacrifice to Rome  I of my life and thou of  Regu'us  One must resign his being one his friend  It is but just that what procures our country  Such real blessings such substantial good  Shou'd cost  thee  somethingI shall lose but little  Go then my friend but promise ere thou goest  With all the Consular Authority  Thou wilt support my counsel in the Senate  If thou art willing to accept these terms  With transport I embrace thy proffer'd friendship  Manl  after a pause  Yes I do promise  Reg  Bounteous Gods I thank you  Ye never gave in all your round of blessing  A gift so greatly welcome to my soul  As Manlius' friendship on the terms of honor  Manl  Immortal powers why am not I a slave  Reg  My friend there's not a moment to be lost  Ere this perhaps the Senate is assembled  To thee and to thy virtues I commit  The dignity of Rome my peace and honor  Manl  Illustrious man farewell  Reg  Farewell my friend  Manl  O what a flame thou hast kindled in my soul  It raises me to something more than man  Glows in each vein and trembles in each nerve  My blood is fired with virtue and with Rome  And every pulse beats an alarm to glory  Who wou'd not spurn the sceptre of a King  As an unworthy bauble

Attil  Tell me Licinius and oh tell me truly  If thou believ'st in all the round of time  There ever breath'd a maid so truly wretched  To weep to mourn a father's cruel fate  To love him with soulrending tenderness  To know no peace by day or rest by night  To bear a bleeding heart in this poor bosom  Which aches and trembles but to  think  he suffers  This is my crimein any  other  child  'Twould be a merit  Licin  Oh my best Attilia  Do not repent thee of the pious deed  It was a virtuous error  That  in  us  Is a just duty which the godlike soul  Of Regulus would think a shameful weakness  If the contempt of life in him be virtue  It were in us a crime to let him perish  Perhaps at last he may consent to live  He then will thank us for our cares to save him  Let not his anger fright thee Tho' our love  Offend him now yet when his mighty soul  Is reconcil'd to life he will not chide us  The sick man loaths and with reluctance takes  The remedy by which his health's restor'd

live I am contented  Licin  Yes he shall live and we again be bless'd  Then dry thy tears and let those lovely orbs  Beam with their wonted lustre on Licinius  Who lives but in the sunshine of thy smiles  Exit  Licinius  Attil alone  O fortune fortune thou capricious Goddess  Thy frowns and favours have alike no bounds  Unjust or prodigal in each extreme  When thou wou'd'st humble human vanity  By singling out a wretch to bear thy wrath  Thou crushest him with anguish to excess  If thou wou'd'st  bless  thou mak'st the happiness  Too poignant for his giddy sense to bear  Immortal Gods who rule the fates of men  Preserve my father bless him bless him Heav'n  If your avenging thunderbolts  must  fall  Strike  here  this bosom will invite the blow  And  thank  you for it But in mercy spare  Oh spare  his  sacred venerable head  Respect in  him  an image of yourselves  And leave a world who wants it an example  Of courage wisdom constancy and truth  Yet if eternal Powers who rule this ball  You have decreed that Regulus must fall  Teach me to yield to your divine command  And meekly bow to your correcting hand  Contented to resign or pleas'd receive  What wisdom may withhold

circumscrib'd within the wretched bounds  Of  self  a narrow miserable sphere  Glory exalts enlarges dignifies  Absorbs the  selfish  in the  social  feelings  And teaches virtue how to charm mankind  It is this principle this spark of deity  Rescues debased humanity from guilt  And elevates it by her strong excitements  It takes off sensibility from pain  From peril fear plucks out the sting from

Her tears my son  Would dim the glories of thy father's triumph  Her sinking spirits are subdu'd by grief  And shou'd her sorrows pass the bounds of reason  Publius have pity on her tender age  Compassionate the weakness of her sex  We must not hope to find in  her  soft soul  The strong exertion of a  manly  courage  Support her fainting spirit and instruct her  By thy example how a Roman

fears  Sees not a beam of hope or if she sees it  'Tis not the bright warm splendor of the sun  It is a sickly and uncertain glimmer  A feeble ray which like a languid glare  Of instantaneous light'ning passes by  It shews but not diminishes the danger  And leaves my poor benighted soul as dark  As it had never shone  Barce  Come let us go  Yes Joys unlook'd for now shall gild thy days

fancy full of his idea  Presents him to memangled gash'd and torn  Stretch'd on the rack in writhing agony  The torturing pincers tear his quivering flesh  And the dire murderers view the gaping wounds  With smiles malignant and with fiendlike rapture  His groans their music and his pangs their sport  And if they lend some interval of case  Some dear bought intermission meant to make  The following pang more exquisitely felt  Th' insulting executioners exclaim  "Now Roman  feel  the vengeance thon hast  scorn'd"  Man  Repress thy sorrows  Attil  Ahrepress my sorrows  And can the friend

thy feeble throne  Since thou but serv'st to shew me what I've lost  To heighten all the horrors that await me  To summon up a wild distracted croud  Of fatal images to shake my soul  To scare sweet peace and banish hope itself  Farewel delusive dreams of joy farewel  Come fell Despair thou paleey'd spectre come  For thou shalt be Attilia's inmate now  And thou shalt grow and twine about her heart  And she shall be so much enamour'd of thee  The pageant Pleasure ne'er shall interpose  Her gaudy presence to divide you more  Stands in an Attitude of silent Grief  Enter Licin  At length I've

the sacred treasury of woe  And breaks the league Despair and I have made  Licin  'Tis one who comes the messenger of Heav'n  To talk of peace of comfort and of joy  Attil  Didst thou not mock me with the sound of joy  Thou little know'st the anguish of my soul  If thou believ'st I ever can again  So long the wretched sport of angry fortune  Admit delusive Hope to my sad bosom  NoI abjure the flatterer and her train  Let those who ne'er have been like me deceiv'd  Embrace the fair fantastic sycophant  For I alas am wedded to despair  And will not hear the sound of comfort more  Licin  Cease cease my love this tender voice of woe  Tho' softer than the dying Cygnet's plaint  She ever chaunts her most melodious strain  When death and sorrow harmonize her note  Attil  YesI will listen now with fond delight  For  death  and  sorrow  are my darling themes  Wellwhat hast thou to say of  death  and  sorrow  Believe me thou wilt find me apt to listen  And if my tongue be slow to answer thee  Instead of words I'll give thee sighs and tears  Licin  I come to  day  thy tears not make them  flow  The Gods once more propitious smile upon us  Joy shall again await each happy morn  And evernew delight shall crown the day  Yes Regulus shall live  Attil  Ah me what say'st thou  Alas I'm but a poor weak trembling woman  I cannot bear these wild extremes of fate  Then mock me notI think

will smooth his downward path of life  By our kind cares and unremitting love  And after a long length of virtuous years  At the last verge of honourable age  When nature's glimmering lamp goes gently out  We'll close together close his eyes in peace  Together drop the sweetlypainful tear  Then copy out his virtues in our lives  Attil  And  shall  we be so blest is't  possible  Forgive me my Licinius if I doubt thee  Fate never gave such exquisite delight  As flatt'ring hope hath imag'd to thy soul  But howExplain this bounty of the Gods  Licin  Thou know'st what influence the name of Tribune  Gives it's possessor o'er the people's minds  That power I have exerted not in vain  All are prepar'd to second my designs  The plot is ripethere's not a man but swears  To keep thy godlike father here in Rome  To save  his  life at hazard of his  own  Attil  By what gradation does my joy ascend  I thought that if my father had been sav'd  By any means I had been rich in bliss  But that he lives and lives preserv'd by thee  such a prodigality of fate  I cannot bear my joy with moderation  Heaven should have dealt it with a scantier hand  And not have shower'd such plenteous blessings on me  They are too great too flattering to be real  'Tis some delightful vision which enchants  And cheats my senses weaken'd by misfortune  Licin  Ador'd Attilin now you overpay  A life of love an age of expectation  We'll seek thy father and meanwhile my fair  Compose and calm thy agitated soul  And hush it's sweet emotions ere thou seest him  Pleasure itself is painful in excess  For joys like sorrows in extreme oppress  The Gods themselves our pious cares approve  And to reward our virtue crown our love  Exeunt  ACT V  An Apartment in the Ambassador's Palace Guards and other Attendants seen at a Distance  Ham  WHERE is this wondrous man this matchless hero  This arbiter of kingdoms and of kings  This Delegate of Heaven this Roman God  I long to shew his soaring mind an equal  And bring it to the standard of humanity  What pride what glory will it be to fix  An obligation on his stubborn soul  Oh to constrain a foe to be obliged  The very thought exalts me e'en to rapture  Enter  RECULUS  and  Guards  Ham  Well RegalusAt last  Reg  I know it all  I know the motive of thy just complaint  Be not alarm'd at this licentious uproar  Of the mad populace I will depart  Fear notI will not stay in Rome  alive  Ham  What dost thou mean by uproar and alarms  Hamilcar does not come to vent complaints  He rather comes to prove that Afric too  Produces heroes and that Tiber's banks  May find a rival on the Punic coast  Reg  Be it so'Tis not a time for vain debate  Collect thy peopleLet us strait depart  Ham  Lend me thy hearing first  Reg  O patience patience  Ham  Is it esteem'd a glory to be grateful  Reg  The time has been when 'twas a  duty  only  But 'tis a duty now so little practis'd  That to perform it is become a glory  Ham  If to fulfil it shou'd expose to danger  Reg  It rises then to an illustrious virtue  Ham  Then grant this merit to an  African  Give me a patient hearingThy great son  As delicate in honor as in love  Hath nobly given my Barce to my arms  And yet I know he doats upon the maid  I come to emulate the generous deed  He gave me back my love and in return  I will restore his father  Reg  Ah what say'st thou  Wilt thou preserve me then  Ham  I will  Reg  But how  Ham  By leaving thee at liberty to  fly  Reg  Ah  Ham  I will dismiss my guards on some pretence  Meanwhile do thou escape and lie conceal'd  I will affect

piercing ray of virtue  Know African the scheme thou dost propose  Would injure  me  thy  country  and  thyself  Hamil  Thou dost mistake  Reg  Who was it gave thee power  To rule the destiny of Regulus  Am I a slave to  Carthage  or to  thee  Hamil  What does it signify from whom proud Roman  Thou dost receive this benefit  Reg  A benefit  O savage ignorance is it a benefit  To lie elope deceive and be a villain  Hamil  What not when life itself when all's at stake  Know'st thou my countrymen prepare thee tortures  That shock imagination but to think of  Thou wilt be mangled butcher'd rack'd impal'd  Does not thy nature shrink  Rig  smiling at his Threats  Hamilcar no  Dost thou not know the Roman genius better  We live on honor'tis our food our all  The motive and the measure of our deeds  We look on death as on a common object  The tongue nor faulters nor the cheek turns pale  Nor the calm eye betrays a single terror  We court and we embrace him undismay'd  We smile at tortures if they lead to glory  And only cowardice and guilt alarm us  Hamil  Fine sophistry the valor of the tongue  The heart disclaims it leave this pomp of words  And cease dissembling with a friend like me  I know that life is dear to all who live  That death is dreadfulyes and must be fear'd  E'en by the frozen Apathists of Rome  Reg  Did I fear death when on Bagrada's banks  I fac'd and slew the formidable serpent  That made your boldest Africans recoil  And shrink with horror tho' the monster liv'd  A native inmate of their own parch'd deserts  Did I fear death before the gates of Adis  Ask Bostar or let Asdrubal declare  Hamil  Or shall I rather of  Xantippus  ask  Who dar'd to undeceive deluded Rome  And prove this vaunter not invincible  'Tis even said in Africa I mean  He made a prisoner of this Demi god  Did we not triumph then  Reg  Vain boaster no  No  Carthaginian  conquer'd Regulus  Xantippus was a  Greek  a brave one too  Yet what distinction did your Afric make  Between the man who serv'd her and her foe  I was the object of her open hate  He of her secret dark malignity  He durst not trust the nation he had sav'd  He knew and therefore fear'd youYes he knew  Where once you were oblig'd you ne'er forgave  Cou'd you forgive at all you'd rather pardon  The man who  hated  than the man who  serv'd  you  Xantippus found his ruin ere it reach'd him  Lurking behind your honors and rewards  In your feign'd courtesies and treacherous fawnings  When vice intends to strike a master stroke  It's veil is smiles it's language protestations  The Spartan's merit  threaten'd  but his service  Compell'd  his ruin  Both  you  could  not pardon  Hamil  Come come I know full well  Reg  Barbarian peace  I've heard too muchGo call thy followers  Prepare thy ships and learn to do thy duty  Hamil  Yesshow thyself intrepid and insult me  Call mine the blindness of barbarian friendship  On Tiber's banks I hear thee and am calm  But know thou scornful Roman that too

chains  Barce  Yet thou dost weepthy eyes at least are honest  For they refuse to share thy tongue's deceit  They speak the genuine language of affliction  And tell the sorrows that oppress thy soul  Attil  Grief that disolves in tears relieves the heart  When congregated vapors melt in rain  The sky is calm'd and all's serene again  Exit  Barce  Whywhat a strange fantastic land is this  This love of glory's the disease of Rome  It makes her mad it is a wild delirium  An universal and contagious frenzy  It preys on all it spares nor sex nor age  The Consul envies Regulus his chains  He not less mad contemns his life and freedom  The daughter glories in the father's ruin  And Publius more distracted than the rest  Resigns the object that his soul adores  For this vain phantom for this empty glory  This may be virtue but I thank the Gods  The soul of Barce's not a Roman soul  Exit  Scene within sight of the Tiber ships ready for the embarkation of Regulus and the Ambassador Tribune and

Recorded with her worthiest Citizens  The name of Regulus the  Captive  Regulus  My countrymen I what think you kept in awe  The Volsci Sabines Aequi and Hernici  The  arms  of Rome alone no 'twas her  virtue  That sole surviving Good which men may keep  Tho' fate and warring worlds combine against them  This still is mineand I'll preserve it Romans  The wealth of Plutus shall not bribe it from me  If you alas require this sacrifice  Carthage herself was less my foe than Rome  She took my freedomshe could take no more  But Rome to crown her work wou'd take my honor  My friends I if you deprive me of my chains  I am no more than any other slave  Yes Regulus becomes a common captive  A wretched lying perjur'd sugitive  But if to grace my bonds you leave my honor  I shall be still a Roman tho a slave  Licin  What faith should be observ'd with savages  What promise should be kept with bonds extort  Reg  Unworthy subterfuge ah let us leave  To the wild Arab and the faithless Moor  These wretched maxims of deceit and fraud  Examples ne'er can justify the coward  The brave man never seeks a vindication  Save from his own just bosom and the Gods  From principle not precedent he acts  As that arraigns him or as that acquits  He stands or falls condemn'd or justify'd  Licin  Rome is no more if Regulus departs  Reg  Let Rome remember Regulus must die  Nor wou'd the moment of my death be distant  If nature's work had been reserv'd for nature  What Carthage means to do  she  wou'd have done  As speedily perhaps at least as surely  My wearied life has almost reach'd it's goal  The oncewarm current stagnates in these veins  Or thro' it's icey channels slowly creeps  View the weak arm and the pale surrow'd cheek  The slacken'd finew and the dim sunk eye  And tell me  then  I must not think of dying  How can I serve you else My feeble limbs  Wou'd totter now beneath the armour's weight  The burthen of that body it once shielded  You see me friends you see my countrymen  I can no longer shew myself a Roman  Except by  dying  like oneGracious Heaven  Has pointed out a glorious way to crown  A life of virtue with a death of honor  Oh do not frustrate then the will of Jove  And load my latest hours with infamy  Come come I know my noble Romans better  I see your souls I read repentance in them  Yon all applaud menay you wish my chains  'Twas nothing but excess of love misled you  And as you're Romans you will conquer that  YesI perceive your weakness is subdu'd  Seize seize the moment of returning virtue  Throw to the ground my sons those hostile arms  Retard no

princes grace his chariot wheels  Tho' tributary monarchs wait his nod  And vanquish'd nations bend the knee before him  E'er shone with half the lustre that surrounds  This voluntary sacrifice for
