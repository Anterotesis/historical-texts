depth of thought the force of reason and the perspicuity of expression that generally appears in them I cannot but be extremely surprized and concerned that a Gentleman of your abilities should have taken so much pains not only to depreciate one of the noblest of all the sciences but to disparage to traduce and even to defame a set of learned men whose labours so greatly conduce to the honour of this island and to the general good of mankind  You will easily see that I speak of Mathematicks and the  British  Mathematicians and of the manner in which you have been pleased to treat them in your late pamphlet intitled  The Analyst  That discourse it is true is seemingly directed to one person only but you are not got through your first section before you speak of  too many more of the like character  with him and in the contents to that very section as well as in all the rest of your discourse you talk of Mathematicians in so general a manner that I am afraid your readers will think very few if any of those Gentlemen are to be excepted out of that number against which you bring so heavy a charge  This charge Sir consists of three principal points  Of infidelity with regard to the Christian Religion  Of endeavouring to make others Infidels and succeeding in those endeavours by means of  the deference  which is paid  to their judgment as being presumed to be of all men the greatest masters of reason  Of error and false reasoning in their own science  This Sir is the charge you have been pleased to bring against our Mathematicians and I intend particularly to examine with what reason and truth you have done so But before I do this I must beg leave to make a few observations upon the intent and design of your treatise the advantage to be expected from it the prudence and justice and honour of this design and after that to inquire whether the motive to your writing it were really what you pretend and avow  If your design were to be guessed at from your Titlepage wherein you profess to  examine whether the object principles and inferences of the modern Analysis are more distinctly conceived or more evidently deduced than religious mysteries and points of faith  one would be apt to conclude your intent was to shew that the mysteries of Religion might be as clearly conceived as the object and principles of the modern Analysis and that the several points of our Faith might be as evidently deduced as the inferences of that Analysis are from its principles or in other words that you were about to give us a Mathematical demonstration or one of equal clearness and certainty of the truth of the  Christian Religion This I say from the words of your Titlepage one would naturally take to be your design but it is so far from being so that throughout your whole discourse though addressed to an  Infidel Mathematician  I do not find the least attempt towards establishing the evidence of our Christian Faith  I find therefore no other way of reconciling your Titlepage with the substance of your discourse than by supposing you pretend to prove that the object principles and inferences of the modern Analysis are not more distinctly conceived nor more evidently deduced than religious Mysteries and point of Faith  i e  that there is no more evidence and certainty in the modern Analysis than in the Christian Religion But how far you do honour to Christianity by entering into a comparison between the evidence and certainty of the Religion taught us by our Saviour and his Apostles and the evidence and certainty of the doctrine of Fluxions delivered by Sir  Isaac Newton  and his followers a doctrine in your opinion  full of error false reasoning manifest sophisins fallacious and inconsistent ways of arguing such as would not be allowed of in Divinity    I shall leave to your brethren the Divines to consider  Not to insist therefore too long upon this I shall now dismiss your Titlepage and shall come to your declared and avowed design which it must be owned you have steadily pursued through your whole discourse to lessen the reputation and authority of Sir  Isaac Newton  and his followers by shewing that they are not such  great masters of reason  as they are generally presumed to be and to depreciate the science they profess by demonstrating to the world that it is not of that clearness and certainty as is commonly imagined  You must excuse us Sir if this design appears a very strange one to us of the University who plainly see of how great use Mathematical Learning is to mankind not only to those who make it a part of their studies but to all the rest of the world who without knowing any thing of Mathematicks do yet daily and hourly reap the benefit of the inventions of Mathematical men in all parts of life especially in Mechanical arts in Architecture Civil Naval and Military and in Navigation upon which the prosperity and security of this Nation so  much depends Though we see and know that the study of Mathematicks flourishes among us as much as in any part of the world and that our youth have as good assistance and opportunities for cultivating that science as are any where to be met with yet we are far from thinking that too many of our students engage in this pursuit or spend too much of their time in it Believe me Sir the generality of youth have more need of the spur than the bridle when they are to enter upon a study that requires so laborious an attention and so constant an application Why then would we ask is the study of Mathematicks to be discouraged and undervalued What could be the reason or motive for your engaging in such a design  I perceive your answer is ready Mathematicians are Infidels and make use of their reputation and authority as being esteemed  the greatest Masters of reason  to pervert other persons to infidelity Really Sir this assertion of yours is new to us and extremely surprizes us We see nothing of it here and cannot easily believe it is so any where else  But admitting it for the present to be true have you well considered whether it be for the advantage of Christianity to publish to the world that a numerous set of learned men and of such learned men as are  Analyst  p  supposed to apprehend more distinctly consider more closely infer more justly conclude more accurately than other men  do not believe the truth of the Christian Religion This methinks is an assertion fitter for an  Alciphron  or a  Lysicles  to make than for a Christian Divine  Tell it not in Gath publish it not in the streets of Askalon  Though the evidence and certainty of our holy Religion is so firmly established as not to be shaken by the arguments much less by the reputation and authority of any unbelievers whatsoever yet I am afraid it would be a great stumbling block to men of weak heads if they were made to believe that the justest and closest reasoners were generally Infidels You know Sir it was a shrewd objection tho' by no means a valid or conclusive one that was made against our Saviour  Have any of the High Priests or of the Pharisees  the men of greatest learning and esteemed the  greatest masters of reason  in those days  believed in him  And if there were any room to renew this objection in our days as considering the piety and zeal of the Christian Priests of all degrees and their constant and sincere attachment to the interest of the Christian Religion and to nothing else surely there is not it would indeed be a very perplexing one  If we should now make you a farther concession and suppose it not only to be true but to be publickly and notoriously known that the body of our Mathematicians are Infidels and enemies to Christianity what think you is the method to be taken What other you will say but to ruin the reputation of our adversaries If we cannot attack them in their lives and conversations we must at least endeavour to shew that they are destitute of learning and reason This will lessen their authority among the people will prevent their  Analyst  p  misleading unwary persons in matters of the highest concernment  and will take off  p  that biass and deference for their judgment  which causes weak  Ibid  minds to submit to their decisions where they have no right to decide  Why really Sir this may do very well if you are sure  of succeeding in your attempt At least it must be acknowledged that you do  stare super vias antiquas  This is the very method which the  Odium Theologicum  the intemperate zeal of Divines has always pursued and has practised with great success for many ages But I must beg leave to observe that it is a very different course from what was taken by  Jesus Christ  and his Apostles on the like occasion  I thank thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth  says our Saviour  that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes  And after his example the great Apostle of the Gentiles though he was fully sensible of the opposition he met with in preaching the Gospel from the  Greek  Philosophers yet did not think it necessary to enter the lists with the Disciples of  Plato  and the Stoicks and to shew that they did not understand Geometry or Philosophy in order to lessen their reputation and thereby to take off from the weight of their opposition to Christianity He contents himself with observing that  not many wise not many learned are called  though  the Greeks seek after wisdom  though  Christ crucified is unto the Greeks foolishness    yet  the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God  Many more passages may be found in his Epistles to the same purpose  You see Sir that neither our Saviour nor his Apostles who were guided by his Holy Spirit denied either wisdom or prudence or learning to such unbelievers as were really possessed of those qualities they well knew there was nothing to fear that  there was no inchantment against Jacob nor divination against Israel  and that no human abilities or accomplishments whatsoever could be able to withstand the Divine authority and the irresistible evidence of the Religion they taught and defended  It will be said perhaps this is too great a pattern for you to follow though there was no fear that the abilities the reputation and authority of any adversaries whatsoever could withstand our Saviour or his Apostles yet what was no match for them may possibly be too hard for you unless you take proper means to prevent it How Sir Has not our Saviour promised  to be with you unto the end of the world  Has he not assured us that even  the gates of hell shall not prevail against his Church  After this declaration  is there any thing to fear Can any means be necessary but such as he has recommended by his practice and example Can calumny and detraction and artifice to lessen the reputation of your adversaries be means fit to be used by the followers of St  Paul  and  of Jesus Christ  If any human means are requisite surely they should be such as are innocent and just rather than this criminal method of lessening or detracting from your opponents  What are these you will say Why plainly Sir to fight your enemies with their own weapons to endeavour to excel in those arts with which they oppose you St  Paul made himself all things to all men if thereby he might gain some  If Mathematicians are such dangerous adversaries to Christianity let the Church of  England  take care of the education of her Clergy let her write over her pulpits as  Plato  is said to have done over the entrance of his school  Let no man enter into orders unless he be an able Mathematician When this is done Sir let us see what Mathematical Infidel will dare to beard a Christian Priest as  great a master of reason  as himself and armed besides with his  Theological accomplishments and the authority of his sacred Function but above all with that ineffable and incomprehensible Gift which every one of you receive at your ordination  Surely no man will think this too laborious a task for the zeal and piety of the Christian Clergy to undertake if the salvation of souls depends upon it Do not we see how wholly they devote themselves to this only end and purpose how neglecting and despising all the gratifications of sense all the allurements of worldly interest of honour riches and power they allot every portion of their time that can possibly be spared from the necessary exercises of their function to the better enabling themselves to take care of the souls committed to their charge Do not they for this purpose with incredible pains and indefatigable industry ransack and make themselves masters of all the treasures of antiquity sacred and profane Hence those nervous and cogent arguments that invincible power of reason that resistless force of eloquence which thunders from every pulpit to withstand the gainsayer to reclaim the deluded to confirm the wavering to silence confound  and astonish the obstinate incorrigible Heretick and Infidel And shall we can we suppose that a small part of their time and pains will not be allowed for arming themselves with proper weapons to encounter our Mathematical unbelievers You Sir have already shewn them how easily this is to be done since notwithstanding your many and great avocations both at home and in very distant regions you have not only made your self master of the most profound the most obscure and most difficult parts of that study but by looking closer and more attentively into them than any body has ever done before you have discovered their most secret defects and have unravelled their most hidden and intricate fallacies And I make no doubt but your great example will excite such a spirit of piety and zeal and industry among your brethren that in time to come even  Euclid  and  Archimedes  and  Apollonius  if they are judged to stand in the way and obstruct the progress of Christianity will be shewn to abound as much with false and fallacious reasoning as Sir  Isaac Newton  This Sir would be the innocent the just and honourable method of encountring the adversaries of our Religion rather to  meet them in the field than to seek to nail their cannon to blow up their ammunition and set fire to their magazines but if you chuse the other as safer though less commendable as easier to your brethren though more laborious to your self I am content and provided you go through with the undertaking shall be ready to join with the Reverend Defenders of our faith in a solemn chorus to your eternal honour and renown  Unus homo nobis carpendo restituit rem  Non ponebat enim rumores ante salutem  Ergo magis{que} magis{que} viri nunc gloria claret  Now therefore Sir we come to our main and principal point to examine by what means in order to prevent the danger that Christianity is threatened with from our Mathematical Infidels you propose to lessen their reputation and to shew that they are not such just and close reasoners as is commonly imagined I shall prove say you that the method of Fluxions invented by Sir  Isaac Newton  and implicitly received by all our Mathematicians is built upon false and precatious principles  This will do something I must confess in as much as it will shew that Mathematicians are men and liable to error But if they are mistaken in thinking the method of Fluxions to be a sound and just one will it follow from this that in all the other parts of their science they do not reason justly and accurately You know very well Sir that Fluxions are of very late invention and that though they are a noble and useful part of Mathematicks yet the whole of Mathematicks does not consist in Fluxions Mathematicians were always reckoned to be  great masters of reason  before Fluxions were invented And as the use of Fluxions does by no means supersede the doctrine of Geometry delivered by  Euclid    Apollonius  and so many others of the great masters both antient and modern not to mention Algebra and all the other parts of the Mathematicks against which you make no objection will it not follow that Mathematicians are still to be esteemed just and accurate reasoners though they have been led into some mistakes in the method of Fluxions by their implicit deference to the judgment of the Great Author of that invention  But farther if it should appear that there is no mistake in that method that the object of it is clearly conceived that its principles are evident and certain that the inferences drawn from them are justly deduced that the whole doctrine is established upon a clear just and solid foundation and that it is you only who have been guilty of a most inexcusable oversight in which the meanest Mathematician you could have consulted would have immediately set you right what then will become of your noble and well concerted project to lessen the reputation of Mathematicians for the service of Christianity  Believe me Sir our holy Religion stands in need of no such attempts to serve it  Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis  The better reasoners either Mathematicians or any other sort of men shall be the more likely will they be to embrace truth wherever it shall be found and consequently the more likely to receive the truth and undoubted evidence of the Christian Religion  But pray Sir was it really and indeed the interest of Christianity and nothing else that prompted you to this undertaking Was that your only motive The reason of my doubt  is that Sir  Isaac Newton  who by your own acknowledgment was not an Infidel is no more spared in your performance nay on the contrary is more severely handled than any of his followers whom you suppose to be Infidels For besides the charge brought against him and them in common of the  want of good Geometry and good Logic of error and false reasoning  you frequently represent him as  conscious of the defect of his principles  and yet endeavouring to impose upon and to mislead his followers  by shifts artifice and subtilty by ambiguous terms by puzzling palliating and fallacious ways of proceeding  c that is you represent them only as weak men deceived and imposed upon but him both as a weak and an ill man as not only deceived but a deceiver and an impostor Did zeal for Christianity move you to this To treat in this manner a person whom you acknowledge to have been a believer of the Christian Religion I am afraid we must look out for some other motive and in order to discover it I shall take the liberty of considering a little what has been your conduct with regard to Mathematicians not only since you have been informed of their being Infidels but five and twenty years ago when  it may be reasonably supposed you had heard and seen less of them than you have lately done  About that time you published an  Essay towards a new Theory of Vision  wherein you were pleased to insert a great many severe censures upon Mathematicians relating to their ignorance of the fundamental principles of their own science Had you then heard of their being Infidels If so why were many of those censures greatly mollified upon farther consideration in a new edition of that piece published the last year And how comes a new charge of ignorance to be brought against them on another account at this time Really Sir I can no way ascribe all this to a zeal for Christianity but if I may be allowed to make one hypothesis it will then be easy to account clearly and distinctly for every particular of your conduct It is briefly this that you have too great an opinion of your self and too mean a one of all other men Hence not content with the reputation you have deservedly acquired of being a clear and just reasoner you can never rest unless you convince the world that all those who have hitherto been esteemed the  greatest masters  of reason  are in this respect greatly inferior to Dr  B  y  Else why these attacks upon Mathematicians in general Why are Dr  Barrow  and Sir  Isaac Newton  singled out from among the Mathematicians and why Mr  Locke  and Lord  Shaftsbury  among those who are esteemed clear and just reasoners though not Mathematicians but to shew that Dr  B  y  is a closer a juster and more accurate reasoner than any of these four Gentlemen not to be matched perhaps by four others not only in  Great Britain  but in the world Were these Gentlemen all unbelievers Yourself will not call them so and if we except one you will not in the least suspect them to be so Why then are they all attacked in your writings I cannot possibly surmise any other cause but that they are all esteemed  great masters of reason  and that you are disposed to lessen their reputation in order to exalt your own Two of them you have been pleased to charge with contradiction gross apparent glaring contradiction such as were utterly unpardonable in a man who makes the least pretence to reasoning such as no body could possibly suspect in those great men who had not a much greater opinion of his own abilities  than of theirs such as no man who had the least distrust or diffidence of himself could ever imagine them to be guilty of I would say Sir that had you supposed it possible for your self ever to fall into any mistake you would certainly when you imagined Sir  Isaac Newton  and Mr  Locke  to have so manifestly contradicted themselves have looked over those passages of their writings a second time you would have done this coolly attentively and considerately and had you done so you would have found your self in a gross evident mistake and would have seen them to be clearly and perfectly consistent with themselves I must take leave to add that your not doing so does evidently prove the truth of the hypothesis I laid down but now that you have too good an opinion of your self and too mean a one of those great men One of these I shall of course be led to vindicate in the pursuit of my design and as your mistake about the other has a near relation to Geometry before I close this letter I shall take up a little of your time in rectifying that likewise  Having finished my considerations upon the design the usefulness prudence and justice  of your performance and your motive for entering upon it I come now to examine into the charge you have brought against our Mathematicians  Of infidelity with respect to the Christian Religion  Of endeavouring to make others Infidels and succeeding in those endeavours by means of  that deference  which is paid  to their judgment as being presumed to be of all men the greatest masters of reason  Of error and false reasoning in their own science  Here Sir I must beg leave to ask what proof you can bring of the two first articles of this accusation I have carefully perused your whole discourse and do not find the least foundation for them except only that you say in your first page  you are not a stranger to the authority that one  nameless Infidel Mathematician  assumes in things foreign to his profession nor to the abuse that he and too many more of the like character are known to make of such undue authority to the misleading of unwary persons in matters of the highest concernment and whereof his Mathematical knowledge can by no means qualify him to be a  competent judge  and that in your second page you tell us  That this is one way of making Infidels you are credibly informed  How say you Sir  you are not a stranger to it it is known you are credibly informed Bene habet nil plus interrogo  Let us burn or hang up all the Mathematicians in  Great Britain  or halloo the mob upon them to tear them to pieces every mother's son of them  Tros Rutulusve fuat  Laymen or Clergymen tho' some of these by their preaching their writings their lives and conversations are thought to do honour to their order Let us dig up the bodies of Dr  Barrow  and Sir  Isaac Newton  and burn them under the gallows and demolish the monuments erected to their memories What tho' the first be esteemed one of the greatest luminaries of the Christian Church and the other be acknowledged to have been a true believer and to have given some of the strongest and clearest proofs that have ever been produced of the goodness wisdom and power of the Supreme Being No matter their followers are Freethinkers Minute Philosophers and Infidels and labour to make others so Dr  B  y is not a stranger to it it is known he is credibly informed of it  For God's sake Sir are we in  England  or in  Spain  Is this the language of a Familiar who is whispering an Inquisitor against a single Heretick or of a Protestant Divine against a great number of Gentlemen professing the Protestant Religion and in a Protestant Country There indeed such an accusation might be destructive to the persons it fell upon how innocent soever but here thanks be to God and to our Religious and Civil Liberties as no proof is brought against us we have no more to do but to aver our innocence absolutely to deny the charge and plainly to tell you that your  Informers  how  credible  soever you may think them are no other than a pack of base profligate and impudent Lyers  This language may seem too warm but so detestable and groundless a defamation will justify the use of it And I must tell your self Sir that tho' I can by no means think you to have been the author and inventor of so horrid a calumny yet you can never be acquitted of extreme credulity in giving ear and belief to it nor of an unpardonable injustice in publishing and propagating it as far as in you lay through the nation Surely if you had not a very  strong inclination to think and speak ill of Mathematicians you could not have done either the one or the other For is it at all likely or probable that a number of persons great part of whose employment has been to study Geometry  an excellent Logic  as you observe  Analyst  p  where the definitions are clear where the Postulata cannot be refused nor the Axioms denied where from the distinct contemplation and comparison of figures their properties are derived by a perpetual wellconnected chain of consequences the objects being still kept in view and the attention ever fixed upon them whereby there is acquired an habit of reasoning close and exact and methodical which habit strengthens and sharpens the mind and being transferred to other objects is of general use in the inquiring after truth  is it probable or even possible I would say that a great number of persons who have  acquired this habit of reasoning  should generally not see and comprehend the clear the certain and undeniable evidence of the Christian Religion  Credat Judaeus Apella  Nor can I find a grain more of probability in the second article of your accusation than in the first Suppose a Mathematician  to be an Infidel and to endeavour to make converts to Infidelity will a deference be paid to his judgment in Divinity any more than in Law or Physick or any other science foreign to his own profession Will his decisions against the Christian Religion pass even upon weak and vulgar minds because he is thought to reason well in Geometry  Id popuĺus curat scilicet  Dr  Barrow  was a great and famous Mathematician till Sir  Isaac Newton  shone out  Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit amnes  Proestrinxit stellas exortus uti oetherius sol  Dr  Barrow  was esteemed the greatest Geometrician in  England  he was likewise a learned sound and Orthodox Divine and yet the Arrians the Socinians the Quakers and the several other sects of Dissenters are still in being though that  great Master of reason  both in Mathematicks and Divinity was of a contrary opinion to them all Sir  Isaac Newton  was a greater Mathematician than any of his contemporaries in  France  no  Frenchman  will deny it and yet I have not heard that the French Mathematicians are converted to the Protestant Religion  by his authority though Sir  Isaac  was known to be a zealous Protestant When this great man had any illness he did not trust to his own judgment for the cure of it though so  great a master of reason  but sent for Dr  Mead  and submitted himself intirely to his directions and I suppose upon occasion would have paid the same deference to his Lawyer But I am ashamed to insist so long upon a thing so evident and shall therefore now come to that article of your charge which you seem to have much more at heart than the interest of the Christian Religion namely that of the errors and false reasoning of Mathematicians in their own science or rather in that one part of their science which is commonly called the method of Fluxions  Your objections against this method may I think all of them be reduced under these three heads  Obscurity of this doctrine  False reasoning used in it by Sir  Isaac Newton  and implicitely received by his followers  Artifices and fallacies used by Sir  Isaac Newton  to make this false reasoning pass upon his followers I shall treat of these in their order  Obscurity of the doctrine of Fluxions  It must be owned that this doctrine as it is one of the most profound parts of Geometry and perhaps the greatest instance that has ever been given of the extent of human abilities is not without its difficulties and will doubtless seem obscure to every unqualified or inattentive reader of Sir  Isaac Newton  But if a person duly furnished with the necessary previous knowledge of Geometry shall peruse his writings with that care and attention which the dignity and importance of the subject deserves I do assure you Sir from my own experience and that of many others whom I could name that the doctrine may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended If  your imagination is strained and puzzled with it  if it appears to you to contain  obscure and inconceivable mysteries  in short if you do not understand it I tell you others do and you may do so too if you will read it with due attention and with a desire of comprehending it rather than an inclination to censure it  You will say perhaps you have already done this and find  the clear conception of it to be impossible and appeal to the trial of every  thinking reader  Pray Sir who are these  thinking readers  you appeal to Are they Geometricians or persons wholly ignorant of Geometry If the former I leave it to them if the latter I ask how well are they qualified to judge of the method of Fluxions I you will say have represented that method to them and from what I have laid before them they may easily judge of it But have you fairly and truly and fully represented it Have not you very much abridged what Sir  Isaac Newton  for the more easy and clear comprehension of his doctrine has delivered more at large in those  Introd ad Quadr Curv Princ Phil Math lib    lemm    parts of his works from which your account of Fluxions is taken Have you given any account of another  Princ Phil Math lib    Sect    part of his writings where the foundation of this method is geometrically demonstrated and largely explained and difficulties and objections against it are clearly solved Have you not altered his expressions in such a manner as to mislead and confound your readers instead of informing them Where do you find Sir  Isaac Newton  using such expressions as  the velocities of the velocities the  second third and fourth velocities the incipient celerity of an incipient celerity the nascent augment of a nascent augment  Is this the true and genuine meaning of the words  fluxionum mutationes magis aut minus celeres  Believe me Sir it is very easy by such pious arts as these to make any doctrine appear absurd even to a  thinking reader  unless instead of trusting to the representation of an adversary he will take the pains to consult the Author that is censured This therefore I shall advise both your  thinking reader  and your self to do and shall betake myself to the consideration of the next head of your objections  False reasoning used in the method of Fluxions by Sir  Isaac Newton  and implicitely received by his followers  Of this you produce two instances both relating to a point which you justly call fundamental namely the rule for finding the Fluxion of the rectangle of two flowing quantities one of which instances is taken from the  Principia Philos  and the other from the book of Quadratures  Analyst p    The objection you make to the first of these is that the Author in order to  find the moment or increment of the rectangle  AB  does not take the sides  A  +  a  and  B  +  b  as increased by their whole moments  a  and  b  which you say is  the direct and true method  but instead thereof uses  the illegitimate and indirect method  of supposing the sides  A  and  B  to be  deficient or lesser by one half of their moments  as  A  ½  a  and  B  ½  b  and then finding what the increment of the rectangle will be when those sides come to be  increased by the other two halves of their moments  as  A  + ½  a  and  B  + ½  b  By the former method the increment of the rectangle  AB  would come out  aB  +  bA  +  ab  by the latter it is  aB  +  bA  and the difference between these two is the rectangle  ab  Here you are pleased exceedingly to insult and triumph over the great Author of this method and all his followers as being very much at a loss how to get rid of this same rectangle  ab  Why Sir suppose they cannot in geometrical rigour get rid of it but that it must continue to be a part of the increment of the rectangle  AB  and yet Mathematicians reject it and instead of the rigorous geometrical increment  aB  +  bA  +  ab  they use only  aB  +  bA    pray what is it you would infer from this Will it follow that they do not  proceed scientifically  that they are  at a loss how to conduct themselves  that they  don't see their way distinctly  that they  proceed blindfold  Will you say that they do not exactly see the consequence of this omission through their whole proceeding and do not certainly and clearly know how far their conclusion will be affected by it Do not they know that in estimating any finite quantity how great soever proposed to be found by the method of Fluxions a globe suppose as big as that of the earth or if you please of the sun or of the whole planetary system or even the orb of the fixed stars do not they know I say and are they not able clearly and invincibly to demonstrate that in so immense a magnitude this omission shall not cause them to deviate from the truth so much as a single pin's head nay not the thousandth not the millionth part of a pin's head How then can it be said that  they proceed without clearness and without science  and don't know what they are doing nor whither this method is carrying them  I shall here beg leave for the sake of  readers less mathematically qualified to put a very easy and familiar case Suppose two Arithmeticians to be disputing whether vulgar fractions are to be preferred to decimal would it be fair in him who is for expressing the third part of a farthing by the vulgar fraction ⅓ to affirm that his antagonist proceeded blindfold and without knowing what he did when he pretended to express it by c because this expression did not give the rigorous exact value of one third of a farthing Might not the other reply that if this expression was not rigorously exact yet it could not be said he  proceeded blindfold or without clearness and without science  in using it because by adding more figures he could approach as near as he pleased and wherever he thought fit to stop he could clearly and distinctly find and demonstrate how much he fell short of the rigorous and exact value Might not he further say that as the c implied all the possible repetitions of the figure even to infinity therefore his expression did not differ by any the least assignable quantity from the other value ⅓ and that as he knew and clearly conceived  that it did so he could not justly be said to be in any error much less to act in the dark when he used that expression  Having observed that this omission or error as you are pleased to call it in rejecting the rectangle  ab  is at most such an one as can cause no assignable difference how small soever in the conclusions drawn from the method of Fluxions and that Mathematicians in committing this error do nevertheless proceed scientifically and with their eyes open as having a clear and distinct view not only of the original error but of the effect of it both in every step they take and in all the conclusions they draw from this method I shall now for your farther satisfaction proceed to examine whether in reality it be any error at all and whether  aB  +  bA  be not in strict geometrical rigour the true fluxion moment or increment of the rectangle  AB  And as you say  the foreign Mathematicians are supposed by some even of our own to proceed in a manner less accurate perhaps and geometrical yet more intelligible  than that of Sir  Isaac Newton  I shall first consider what course they take in rejecting the rectangle  ab  and  shall then proceed to Sir  Isaac Newton  's way of excluding it  The famous  Marquis de l'Hospital  whom I the rather follow because he is thought to have written upon this subject with greater perspicuity than any other foreign Mathematician as also because you expressly quote him after he has found the fluxion of the rectangle  Analyse  des  infiniment petits Prop    xy  composed of the two variable quantities  x  and  y  to be  ydx  +  xdy  +  dxdy  does afterwards reject the rectangle  dxdy  and thereby leave only  ydx  +  xdy  for the fluxion of  xy  Upon which you  observe    Analyst p    as to the method of getting rid of this quantity dxdy  equivalent to the rectangle  ab  of Sir  Isaac Newton that it is done without the least ceremony  Is this true Does not the Marquis in this very proposition  ibid p    quoted by you and at the very instant that he rejects that quantity give this reason for it that it is infinitely small with respect to the other terms  xdy  and  ydx  Does he not immediately after give a demonstration of its being so And does he not to shew that he has a right to  reject it upon that reason plainly and expressly refer his reader to his first  postulatum  or supposition Does he not in that  postulatum  expressly require it should be allowed him  that a quantity which is augmented or diminished by another quantity infinitely less than the first may be considered as if it continued the same  i e had received no such augmentation or diminution Is not this plainly the case of the quantity  xdy  +  ydx  augmented or diminished by the quantity  dxdy  Have you then done fairly and justly by this Great Man in concealing all this from your  thinking readers  to whose judgment you refer your self and in telling them that  this quantity is rejected without the least ceremony    You will tell me perhaps that you do not allow of this  postulatum  Why then you must not read the  Marquis de l'Hospital  's book The  postulatum  is placed at the very beginning of it as an express declaration to his readers that unless that be allowed him he will not undertake to demonstrate what follows If you admit his  postulatum  you will find him proceed clearly and evidently and like a Mathematician in rejecting the quantity  dxdy  if not you  have no right to attack his proposition founded upon that  postulatum  but only to give your reasons against the  postulatum  itself And thus much in vindication of my first master that great and clearheaded Geometrician the  Marquis de l'Hospital  whose only misfortune it was to have met with muddy waters and not to have drunk of the fountain itself  I come now to consider what course Sir  Isaac Newton  himself has taken to avoid this formidable rectangle  ab  this fatal rock this  Bishop and his Clerks  that threatens destruction to him and all his followers And here Sir in order to give your reasoning its full force I shall transcribe the greatest part of the ninth section of your discourse after which I shall do the same justice to Sir  Isaac Newton  by giving his demonstration in his own words Your ninth section begins thus  Having considered the object I proceed to consider the principle of this new Analysis by Momentums Fluxions or Infinitesimals wherein if it shall appear that your capital points upon which the rest are supposed to depend include error and false reasoning it will then  follow that you who are at a loss to conduct your selves cannot with any decency set up for guides to other men The main point in the method of Fluxions is to obtain the fluxion or momentum of the rectangle or product of two indeterminate quantities Inasmuch as from thence are derived rules for obtaining the Fluxions of all other products and powers be the coefficients or the indexes what they will integers or fractions rational or surd Now this fundamental point one would think should be very clearly made out considering how much is built upon it and that its influence extends throughout the whole Analysis But let the reader judge This is given for demonstration  Philos Nat Princ Math Lib II Lemm    Suppose the product or rectangle  AB  increased by continual motion and that the momentaneous increments of the sides  A  and  B  are  a  and  b  When the sides  A  and  B  were deficient or lesser by one half of their moments the rectangle was  i e  AB  ½  aB  ½  bA  + ¼  ab  And as soon as the sides  A  and  B  are increased by the other two halves of  their moments the rectangle becomes  or  AB  + ½  aB  + ½  bA  + ¼  ab  From the latter rectangle subduct the former and the remaining difference will be  aB  +  bA  Therefore the increment of the rectangle generated by the intire increments  a  and  b  is  aB  +  bA  Q E D But it is plain that the direct and true method to obtain the moment or increment of the rectangle  AB  is to take the sides as increased by their whole increments and so multiply them together  A  +  a  by  B  +  b  the product whereof  AB  +  aB  +  bA  +  ab  is the augmented rectangle whence if we subduct  AB  the remainder  aB  +  bA  +  ab  will be the true increment of the rectangle exceeding that which was obtained by the former illegitimate and indirect method by the quantity  ab  And this holds universally be the quantities  a  and  b  what they will big or little finite or infinitesimal increments moments or velocities Nor will it avail to say that  ab  is a quantity exceeding small Since we are told  Introduct ad Quadrat Curv  that  in rebus mathematicis errores quam minimi non sunt  contemnendi  Such reasoning as this for demonstration nothing but the obscurity of the subject could have encouraged or induced the great author of the fluxionary method to put upon his followers and nothing but an implicite deference to authority could move them to admit The case indeed is difficult There can be nothing done till you have got rid of the quantity  ab  In order to this the notion of Fluxions is shifted It is placed in various lights Points which should be as clear as first Principles are puzzled and terms which should be steadily used are ambiguous But notwithstanding all this address and skill the point of getting rid of  ab  cannot be obtained by legitimate reasoning  It is now time to hear Sir  Isaac Newton  Princip Lib II Lemm Cas  Rectangulum quodvis motu perpetuo auctum  AB  ubi de lateribus  A    B  deerant momentorum dimidia ½  a  and ½  b  fuit  A  ½  a  in  B  ½  b  seu  AB  ½  aB  ½  bA  + ¼  ab  quamprimum latera  A    B  alteris momentorum dimidiis

generatur rectanguli incrementum  aB  +  bA  QED  Having now fairly laid before my reader what both your self and Sir  Isaac Newton  have delivered upon this subject I come to examine which of you is in the right  In the first place I find you take it for granted that what Sir  Isaac Newton  is here endeavouring to find by supposing the sides  A  and  B  first to want one half of their moments and afterwards to have gained the other halves of their moments is the increment of the rectangle  AB  In this I conceive you are mistaken For neither in the demonstration itself nor in any thing preceding or following it is any mention so much as once made of the increment of the rectangle  AB  On the contrary it plainly appears that what he endeavours to obtain by these suppositions is no other than the increment of the rectangle  and you must own that he takes  the direct and true method to obtain it  But you will say is it not the business of this lemma to determine the moments of flowing  quantities And is it not the design of Case to determine the moment of the rectangle  AB  I answer that it is so but that rigorously speaking the moment of the rectangle  AB  is not as you suppose the increment of the rectangle  AB  but it is the increment of the rectangle  In order to clear up this point I must observe  That the word moment is used by Sir  Isaac Newton  and your self to signifie indifferently either an increment or a decrement  That  aB  +  bA  +  ab  is by you demonstrated to be the true increment of the rectangle  AB  That  aB  +  bA    ab  is the true decrement of the same rectangle  AB  as plainly appears upon taking the same  true and direct method  for finding the decrement as you have used for finding the increment  Now Sir I would humbly beg leave to inquire of you who see so much more clearly into these matters than Sir  Isaac Newton  or any of his followers which of these two Quantities  aB  +  bA  +  ab  and  aB  +  bA    ab  you will be pleased to call the moment of the rectangle  AB    The  case indeed is difficult  The difference between them is no less than  ab  just the double of that same  ab  which has given us all so much trouble and yet each of them plead an equal right to the title of moment So equal a one that though I am very sensible of your  address and skill  yet there seems to be no possibility of deciding the controversy between them  by legitimate reasoning  I see but two ways of doing it One is that they should toss up cross or pile for the title Or if that be thought too boyish and unbeseeming the Gravity of Mathematical quantities they must even end the dispute in an amicable manner and without claiming any preference one of another agree that they make two moments between them Then Sir I apprehend the case will stand thus  aB  +  bA  +  ab  +  aB  +  bA    ab  making twice the moment of the rectangle  AB  it follows that  aB  +  bA  will make the single moment of the same rectangle  You see Sir after all the pains you have taken this affair comes out even upon your own concessions just as Sir  Isaac Newton  and his followers would have it Believe me there is no remedy You must acquiesce  Only if it may be any Satisfaction to you to know why Sir  Isaac  took this indirect way of finding the increment of  instead of proceeding directly to find the moment of the rectangle  AB  I shall be ready to oblige you as far as can be expected from one of those who  have shown themselves more eager in applying his method than accurate in examining his principles  The final cause or motive to this proceeding  I find is not unknown to you you say  it is very obvious  meaning I suppose that thereby it was intended to exclude this same troublesome rectangle  ab  Why truly Sir in a book of strict demonstration as Sir  Isaac Newton  intended his  Principia  should be it was certainly more proper to exclude that quantity so as not to suffer it to appear than first to introduce it into the reader's view and then to reject it  You add that  it is not so obvious or easy to explain a just and legitimate reason for it or shew it to be Geometrical  How far it may be obvious or easy to assign such a reason I will not dispute though I am apt to think that what is easy to me cannot be difficult to other persons provided they  use the same endeavours to find the truth as I have done Now I apprehend the reason of this proceeding of Sir  Isaac Newton  to be the following very plain one That in order to find the moment of the rectangle  AB  it is more consonant to strict Geometrical rigour to take the increment of the rectangle  than to take the increment of the rectangle  AB  itself And if I can make this appear you must allow that he had a  just and legitimate reason for proceeding  as he did  You know very well that the moment of the rectangle  AB  is proportional to the velocity of that rectangle with which it alters either in increasing or in diminishing Now I ask in Geometrical rigour what is properly the velocity of this rectangle Is it the velocity with which the rectangle from  AB  becomes  or the velocity with which from  AB  it becomes  I find my self exactly in the case of the Ass between the two bottles of hay I see no reason nor possibility of a reason to determine me either one way or the other But methinks I hear the venerable Ghost of Sir  Isaac Newton  whisper me that the velocity I seek for is neither the one nor the other of these but is the velocity which the flowing rectangle has not while it is greater or less than  AB  neither before nor after it becomes  AB  but at that very instant of time that it is  AB  In like manner the moment of this rectangle is neither the increment from  AB  to  nor is it the decrement from  AB  to  It is not a moment common to  AB  and  which may be considered as the increment of the former or as the decrement of the latter Nor is it a moment common to  AB  and  which may be considered as the decrement of the first or as the increment of the last But it is the moment of the very individual rectangle  AB  itself and peculiar to that only and such as being considered indifferently either as an increment or decrement shall be exactly and perfectly the same And the way to obtain such a moment is not to look for one lying between  AB  and  nor to look for one lying between  AB  and    that is not to suppose  AB  as lying at either extremity of the moment but as extended to the middle of it as having acquired the one half of the moment and as being about to acquire the other or as having lost one half of it and being about to lose the other And this is the method Sir  Isaac Newton  has taken in the demonstration you except against  What say you Sir Is this  a just and legitimate reason  for Sir  Isaac  's proceeding as he did I think you must acknowledge it to be so For even if you should still have any doubt whether his proceeding be rigorously Geometrical yet you cannot but confess that whether moments be considered as infinitely small or as finite quantities his method approaches nearer to Geometrick rigour than that which you propose I think likewise you cannot but be sensible of great want of caution in your own proceeding inasmuch as that quantity which Sir  Isaac Newton  through this whole Lemma and all the several cases of it constantly calls a moment without confining it to be either increment or decrement is by you inconsiderately and arbitrarily and without any shadow of reason given supposed and determined  to be an increment And this Sir naturally leads me to give you a piece of friendly advice which you seem to stand much in need of It is that whenever you take it into your head to criticise upon Sir  Isaac Newton  's writings you first examine and weigh every word he uses and if you translate him keep closely to his expression Believe me this Great Man among his other extraordinary indowments had a peculiar sagacity in foreseeing objections as well as an aversion to disputing To these two qualities accompanied with extreme humanity and condescension it is owing that he uses such accuracy in his expression that an intelligent and attentive reader can never mistake him and that he does of himself first propose and then remove such difficulties as may naturally arise in the minds of even candid and judicious persons who are not yet masters of the subject he treats of But as for the  Homines stolidi ad depugnandum parati  he contents himself with observing that prudent caution in every word he uses that as they shall find nothing to mislead them so on the other hand if they undeservedly and unadvisedly attack him they shall certainly and unavoidably  induere se in stimulos latentes  and expose themselves to the scorn and contempt of every unprejudiced observer  This great example which in any the lowest degree to imitate is the highest honour I can ever arrive at or even desire moves me to propose and remove an objection which may possibly arise in your mind and hinder you from acquiescing in one part of what I have just now laid before you It is that I have supposed the rectangle  AB  extended to the middle of its moment as having acquired the one half of it and being about to acquire the other or as having lost one half of it and being about to lose the other You may say this is strictly and exactly true in respect of the sides of that rectangle which sides from  A  ½  a  and  B  ½  b  are become  A  and  B  and are about to become  A  + ½  a  and  B  + ½  b  but that it is not equally true of the rectangle composed of those sides which from  or  AB  ½  aB  ½  bA  + ¼  ab  is become  AB  and is about to become  or  AB  + ½  aB  + ½  bA  + ¼  ab  since the part of the moment which  AB  is supposed to have  gained namely ½  aB  + ½  bA  ¼  ab  is not equal to that part of the moment which is about to be gained namely ½  aB  + ½  bA  + ¼  ab  the difference between them being ½  ab  In answer to this I reply that these two quantities ½  aB  + ½  bA  ¼  ab  and ½  aB  + ½  bA  + ¼  ab  so long as  a  and  b  are finite quantities are undoubtedly unequal but that the more  a  and  b  are diminished by so much nearer will these quantities approach to an equality and if  a  and  b  are diminished  ad infinitum  the two quantities will then be perfectly equal See this demonstrated  Princip Lib I Sect    Lemm  Which  Lemma  for your own sake and mine I could wish you had consulted sooner  Lastly to remove all scruple and difficulty about this affair I must observe that the moment of the rectangle  AB  determined by Sir  Isaac Newton  namely  aB  +  bA  and the increment of the same rectangle determined by yourself namely  aB  +  bA  +  ab  are perfectly and exactly equal supposing  a  and  b  to be diminished  ad infinitum  and this by the  Lemma  just now quoted  I now come to your second instance of false reasoning which you take from the  Book of Quadratures and passing by the  Lemma  you so gravely lay down to shew that when two contrary suppositions are made nothing can be inferred from either of them as a truth that no Schoolboy can be ignorant of I shall here transcribe this instance of false reasoning as you give it with your observations upon it  Analyst p    Let the quantity  x  flow uniformly and be it proposed to find the Fluxion of  x  n  In the same time that  x  by flowing becomes  x  +  o  the Power  x  n  becomes    i e  by the method of infinite Series  x  n  +  nox  n    +  oox  n    + c and the increments  o  and  nox  n    +  oox  n    + c are one to another as to  nx  n    +  ox  n    + c Let now the increments vanish and their last proportion will be to  nx  n    But it should seem that this reasoning is not fair or conclusive For when it is said let the increments  vanish i e let the increments be nothing or let there be no increments the former supposition that the increments were something or that there were increments is destroyed and yet a consequence of that supposition i e an expression got by virtue thereof is retained Which by the foregoing  Lemma  is a false way of arguing Certainly when we suppose the increments to vanish we must suppose their proportions their expressions and every thing else derived from the supposition of their existence to vanish with them  You are pleased to go on for some number of pages  to make this point plainer to unfold the reasoning  and  to propose it in a fuller light  But I think we may as well stop here You have already so fully  unfolded  it that if this be the way of reasoning of our Mathematical Infidels I pronounce our Religion out of all danger from that quarter From this time our Reverend Clergy may sleep in quiet and be under as little apprehension from the unbelieving Analyst as from the most ignorant of the Popish Monks the most stupid of the Jewish Rabbi's or the most empty and contemptible  praters among the Minute Philosophers I have only one doubt upon me Pray Sir are you very sure that this is the real doctrine of Sir  Isaac Newton  Are you absolutely certain you have not mistaken him You seem I must confess to be exceedingly cautious you blame others for not being  accurate in examining his Principles  you talk of  preventing all possibility of mistaking you  and you treat him and his followers in such a manner that you are to expect no quarter from them in case of ill success And yet this is so great so unaccountable so horrid so truly Boeotian a blunder that I know not how to think a  Great Genius  a  Newton  could be guilty of it For God's sake let us examine it once more  Evanescant jam augmenta illa let now the increments vanish i e let the increments be nothing or let there be no increments  Hold Sir I doubt we are not right here I remember Sir  Isaac Newton  often uses the terms of  momenta nascentia  and  momenta evanescentia  I think I have seen you likewise several times using the like terms of nascent and evanescent increments Also if I am not mistaken both he and you consider a nascent or evanescent moment an increment or decrement  as the same quantity under different circumstances sometimes as in the point of beginning to exist and other times as in the point of ceasing to exist From this methinks it should follow that the two expressions subjoined will be perfectly equivalent to each other  Nascantur  jam augmenta illa eorum ratio  prima  erit  Evanescant  jam augmenta illa eorum ratio  ultima  erit  The meaning of the first can possibly be no other than to consider the first proportion between the nascent augments in the point of their beginning to exist Must not therefore the meaning of the latter be to consider the last proportion between the evanascent augments in the point of evanescence or of their ceasing to exist Ought it not to be thus translated Let the augments now become evanescent let them be upon the point of evanescence What then must we think of your interpretation  Let the increments be nothing let there be no increments  Do not the words  ratio ultima  stare us in the face and plainly tell us that though  there is a last proportion of evanescent increments yet there can be no proportion of increments which are nothing of increments which do not exist I believe Sir every thinking person will acquit Sir  Isaac Newton  of the gross oversight you ascribe to him and will acknowledge that it is your self alone who have been guilty of a most palpable inexcusable and unpardonable blunder I now come to the third head of your objections  Arts and fallacies used by Sir  Isaac Newton  to make his false reasoning pass upon his followers  On this head I shall not need to take up much of your time because having already fully proved that Sir  Isaac Newton  was not guilty of false reasoning in the instances you alledge I suppose no body will think he had any occasion to make use of arts and fallacies to impose upon his followers But you have one observation upon this head which is so very singular that I cannot but think it worthy of particular consideration  Considering    Annalyst  p  say you  the various arts and devices used by the Great Author of the Fluxionary method in how many lights he placeth his Fluxions and in what different ways he  attempts to demonstrate the same point one would be inclined to think he was himself suspicious of the justness of his own demonstrations and that he was not enough pleased with any one notion steadily to adhere to it Thus much at least is plain that he owned himself satisfied concerning certain points which nevertheless he could not undertake to demonstrate to others  Really Sir this seems to be very hard usage Sir  Isaac Newton  has made a new and great discovery by which he has not only outdone all the Geometricians that ever went before him but can enable such ordinary proficients in Mathematicks as you and I to surpass all the great masters of antiquity He is so good as to instruct us in this method and because it requires some pains and discernment to comprehend it rightly he sets it in several various lights that by means of some of these we may not fail of understanding it Pray Sir have you and I any reason to complain of this For my part I think myself greatly obliged to him for his condescension If he had not taken so much pains to explain his doctrine I doubt I should never have understood it But for God's sake what is it you are offended at who do not still  understand him You are all in the dark and yet are angry at his giving you so much light Surely the fault is not in Sir  Isaac Newton  but in your own eyes  So thick a drop serene has quench'd their orbs  Or dim suffusion veil'd  But is not he  himself  say you  suspicious of the justness of his own demonstrations  Pray Sir when a Divine is instructing his hearers in a weighty and important point of Religion if from a desire that every one should perfectly understand him he is at the pains to use several arguments and to set his Doctrine in various lights would it be reasonable or just or grateful in any of his auditors to infer from this that the Preacher was suspicious of the justness of his own reasoning When you after all the demonstrations that had been given of the being of a God by the learned Fathers of the Church and by the wisest of the Philosophers of all ages thought fit to introduce that new and singular one of a  Visual Language  would it be fair in me to suppose that you were suspicious of all the  former proofs of the existence of a Deity and left that great and important truth to depend upon a metaphorical argument Surely one argument may be just and conclusive and perfectly satisfactory to him that uses it and yet the matter treated of may be of that difficulty or of that dignity and importance as not only to admit of but to require several others for the instruction and conviction of his hearers And thus much may suffice for your third and last head of objections against Sir  Isaac Newton  and his followers Only before I conclude I must advise you to correct one word in your extract from his  Analyst  p  Letter to Mr  Collins    Nov  or rather to give up that extract intirely as being of no manner of service to you There is a great deal of difference between saying I cannot undertake to prove a thing and I will not undertake it Sir  Isaac  in that Letter says I will not And besides the point there mentioned is not the point here in debate so that you have no right to draw any inference from that point to this  Having now done with every thing necessary to the vindication of Sir  Isaac Newton  and his followers and thereby driven  you entirely out of our intrenchments I am considering whether I should sally out and attack you in your own You have thrown up some works I see which at a distance make a pretty good appearance and seem capable of defence But upon taking a nearer view of them I judge them to be very slight and untenable and to be guarded rather by a newraised undisciplined Militia than any thing of veteran regular Troops so that it would not be very difficult to carry them by assault But as they seem rather designed for shew than use more to amuse yourself than any way to annoy us I am determined to leave you in possession of them  Only your supposition of a  Analyst  p  seq to  p  double error in the method of Fluxions and the use you make of it to shew how true conclusions are obtained from false principles by means of two contrary mistakes exactly compensating one another has something in it so extraordinary as to require and deserve a particular consideration This darling Phantom this beloved offspring of your teeming brain which like  Minerva  issuing armed from the head of  Jupiter  her spear  in one hand and her Shield with the Gorgon's head in the other is to turn all our Mathematicians into stocks and stones and statues is set forth with so much art and skill and is dressed out in so advantageous and pompous a manner to draw the attention and to dazzle the imagination of the spectators that it would be unpardonable neglect and rudeness in me to pass it by unregarded I shall not therefore content my self with saying that one  See  p  of these errors is already become evanescent i e  is nothing is no error at all  and that the other of them will likewise immediately disappear like  Anal  p  the Ghost of a departed quantity  if you exorcise it with a few words out of the first section of the  Principia  On the contrary I propose so far to gratify your fondness for this hopeful scheme as to give it a fair and full examination  We are to consider therefore what may be the reason that in the method of Fluxions the conclusions are exactly true For in the exactness of the conclusions we are both agreed though there be a wide difference between us in respect of the means by which Mathematicians arrive at that  exactness I conceive that the conclusion is therefore exact because it is deduced by just reasoning from certain principles You on the contrary are of opinion that Sir  Isaac Newton  is guilty of a capital and fundamental error in rejecting the quantity  ab  so often talked of and  Anal p    that the conclusion comes out right not because the quantity rejected is infinitely small but because this error is compensated by another contrary and equal error  And this you say  p    perhaps the Demonstrator himself never knew or thought of  p    If he had committed only one error he would not have come at a true solution of the Problem But by virtue of a twofold mistake he arrives though not at science  yet  at truth For science it cannot be called when he proceeds blindfold and arrives at the truth not knowing how or by what means  This is the way you account for what you justly say  may perhaps seem an unaccountable Paradox    p    that Mathematicians should deduce true Propositions from false Principles be right in the conclusion and yet err in the premisses that error should bring forth truth though it cannot bring forth science  Now truly Sir if this Paradox of yours  should be well made out I must confess it ought very much to alter the opinion the world has had of Sir  Isaac Newton  and occasion our talking of him in a very different manner from what we have hitherto done What think you if instead of the greatest that ever was we should call him the most fortunate the most lucky Mathematician that ever drew a circle Methinks I see the good old Gentleman fast asleep and snoring in his easy chair while Dame Fortune is bringing him her apron full of beautiful Theorems and Problems  which he never knows or thinks of  just as the  Athenians  once painted her dragging towns and cities to her favourite General For what else but extreme good fortune could occasion the conclusions arising from his method to be always true and just and accurate when the premisses were inaccurate and erroneous and false and only led to right conclusions by means of two errors ever compensating one another to the utmost exactness What luck was here That when he had made one capital fundamental general mistake he should happen to make a second as capital as fundamental as general as the first That he should not proceed to commit three or four such  mistakes but stop at the second That these two mistakes should chance not to lie both the same way but on contrary sides so that the one might help to correct the other and lastly that the two contrary errors among all the infinite proportions which they might bear to one another should happen upon that of a perfect equality so that one might in all possible cases be exactly balanced or compensated by the other With a quarter of this good fortune a man might get the  l  prize in the present Lottery with a single Ticket  But to come to our point we are to examine whether the exactness of the conclusion is owing to the exact compensation of of one of these errors by the other or to those errors being utterly insignificant being in reality no errors at all And in order thereto I propose to see how the conclusion will come out when only one of these errors is committed so that there is nothing to compensate it  In your Section which with its figure I here refer to the first error is supposed to be the making the subtangent or  S  =  instead of  S  =    The second error is making  dy  =  instead of  dy  =    If both these errors be committed or if neither of them be committed the conclusion is agreed to be equally just and right giving  S  =  x    If I avoid the first of these errors by making  S  =  and retain the second by supposing  dy  =  my conclusion will be  S  =  x  ×    On the other hand if I commit the first error and avoid the second my conclusion will give me  S  =  x  ×    Now I affirm that these two several values of  S  which are the result of one error only without any thing to compensate it are both true and equally exact with the former value  x  which is the result either of two errors or of none at all You I am sensible will dispute this with me you will say that one of these  x  ×  is less than  x    and the latter  x  ×  is in the same proportion bigger than  x  I beg leave therefore for the information of some of my readers to ask you a question Supposing the true subtangent  x  to be a thousand miles in length how much will the second value of that subtangent  x  ×  fall short of a thousand miles Will it be a yard or a foot or an inch None of these you confess nor the thousandth nor the thousandmillionth part of an inch  I ask farther what then is this difference Is it possible in all the infinity of fractional numbers to find any thing small enough to represent it You own you confess it is not You must confess likewise that if these three several values of S were all to be expressed in numbers without being reducible to which in your  Analyst Query    opinion they can be of no use they must every one be expressed by without the least tittle of variation addition or diminution Behold Gentle Reader what a mighty  Motto to Analyst  beam here has been discovered in the eyes of Mathematicians in comparison of which  all the difficulties in Divinity are but as motes and atoms  Since therefore these errors are wholly insignificant my conclusion when reduced to numbers coming out exactly the same whether the first or second or neither or both of these errors be committed and since by committing both these errors the calculus which would otherwise especially in the higher operations be exceedingly tedious and laborious is now rendered surprisingly expeditious and easy it seems to me that this is so far from being any defect in the method of Fluxions that on the contrary it is one of the greatest advantages and excellencies of that invention But you tell me it is not the usefulness of this method that is the matter in dispute all the question is whether it be scientifical whether those who use it  see their way distinctly or proceed blindfold and arrive at the truth not knowing how or by what means  I have spoken to this before but must add a word or two more in this place You Sir are for avoiding these two errors I am for retaining them When you avoid them do not you  see your way distinctly  And if I retain them voluntarily and with my eyes open  may I not nevertheless clearly see the effect of these errors or of either of them in every step I take and in the conclusion I at last come to May I not therefore likewise be said to  see my way distinctly  Now if you and I can see our way so well I am afraid it will be construed as great presumption in us to suppose that no body does so besides our selves and much more if we should say that the Great Inventor of this method and the Author of so many other wonderful discoveries  never knew or thought of  what to us appears so plain and manifest that he who gave us so much light was in the dark himself that he who opened our Eyes had no sight of his own For my part I can never concur with you in thinking that I see farther or go beyond Sir  Isaac Newton    Sed longe sequor vestigia pronus adoro  But if you think fit to persist in asserting that this affair of a double error is intirely a new discovery of your own which Sir  Isaac  and his followers  never knew nor thought of  I have unquestionable evidence to convince you of the contrary I must acquaint you therefore with what all his followers  are already apprised of that these very objections of yours were long since foreseen and clearly and fully removed by Sir  Isaac Newton  in the first section of the first book of his  Principia  the greater part of which section particularly the first and seventh  Lemma  and that admirable  Scholium  at the end of it was written to this very end and purpose only and to no other in the world  I have now no more to do but only to acquit my self of the promise I made a while ago to rectify a mistake you are fallen into with regard to another of the greatest men the English nation has produced In order to which I must here transcribe the greater part of the CXXV article of your New Theory of Vision  After reiterated endeavours to apprehend the general Idea of a Triangle I have found it altogether incomprehensible And surely if any one were able to introduce that Idea into my Mind it must be the Author of the  Essay concerning Human Understanding  He who has so far distinguished himself from the generality of Writers by the clearness and significancy of what he says Let us therefore see how this celebrated Author describes  the general or abstract Idea of a Triangle  It must be  says he  neither Oblique nor Rectangular neither Equilateral Equicrural nor Scalenum but all and none of these at once In effect it is somewhat imperfect that cannot exist an Idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together  Essay on Human Understanding B iv C S This is the Idea which he thinks needful for the Enlargement of Knowledge which is the subject of Mathematical Demonstration and without which we could never come to know any general Proposition concerning Triangles That Author acknowledges it doth  require some pains and skill to form this general Idea of a Triangle  Ibid But had he called to mind what he says in another place to wit that  Ideas of mixed Modes wherein any inconsistent Ideas are put together cannot so much as exist in the mind  i e be conceived Vid B III C S Ibid I say had this occurred to his Thoughts it is not improbable he would have owned it above all the Pains and Skill he was master of to form the abovementioned Idea of a Triangle which is made up  of manifest staring contradictions That a Man who thought so much and laid so great a stress on clear and determinate Ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seems very surprising  In this section you plainly accuse Mr  Locke  of contradicting himself in two several particulars  The abovementioned Idea of a Triangle say you is made up of manifest staring contradictions  You represent the two following propositions of Mr  Locke  as contradictory one to the other  It  The general Idea of a Triangle  is an Idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together  Ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent Ideas are put together cannot so much as exist in the Mind  I propose to clear up these two points and to shew that in neither of them Mr  Locke  is guilty of contradicting himself but first in order thereto I must take up a little of your time in considering the notion of general or abstract Ideas Which pains I am the rather inclined to take because though I have carefully perused what you  have written upon this subject I am one of those who still adhere to the vulgar or rather universal error of all Mankind that neither Geometry nor any other general science can subsist without general Ideas  Though the words abstract or general Ideas are indifferently used by Writers as having the same common signification yet as it may be a means of rendering what I have to say upon this subject something more intelligible I shall beg leave to make a distinction between them not as being different in themselves but only in respect of the manner in which they are commonly formed or introduced into the mind  I shall confine the name of abstract Idea to that which the mind forms to itself from the consideration of some number of different species by abstracting from those particular Ideas in which the species differ from one another and retaining those in which they agree  I shall call that a general Idea which may be produced in the mind without any consideration or even knowledge of different Species  An example will make this very plain When Mr  Ray  is forming his Method of  Plants he observes that Mint and Sage and Lavender and Rosemary and many other Plants besides their particular characteristicks by which they are distinguished from one another have some other marks in which they all agree as in their leaves growing in pairs opposite to each other a monopetalous labiate flower with four seeds growing at the bottom of it and those inclosed in no other vessel than the perianthium By joining together these common marks he forms his compound Idea of that Genus of Plants which he calls verticillate which from his laying aside or abstracting from all the peculiar distinguishing marks of the several species is properly named an abstract Idea  But if Mr  Ray  will teach me Botany by his Method he must take a different course he must begin with me where he himself ended he must first introduce into my mind the general Idea of a verticillate plant and afterwards descend to particular species He tells me a verticillate plant is one whose leaves grow in pairs opposite to each other and whose flower is monopetalous and labiate with four seeds at the bottom of it and those inclosed only in the perianthium  This in me is properly called a general Idea because I shall find it to comprehend all the particular species of verticillate plants but I have no reason to call it an abstract Idea because not knowing as yet any of the particular species or their characteristick differences I have nothing to abstract from  The abstract Idea therefore is that of the Master or Philosopher and the general Idea that of the Disciple The former requires as Mr  Locke  observes some pains and skill to form it the latter demands neither pains nor skill it needs only a little attention to conceive it  In like manner if a person acquainted with the several species of Triangles is from the consideration of these to form an Idea of a Triangle in general his method will be to examine the several compound Ideas of the different species of Triangles and to distinguish between such parts of those compound Ideas as are the peculiar characteristicks of each species and such parts as are common to all of them in general Then connecting these last together into a new compound Idea and abstracting from all the rest he will have the abstract Idea of a Triangle which is that of a space comprehended  by three right lines add if you please containing three angles  When he has got this Idea himself it is the easiest thing in the world to give it to another Let him take a Learner a Boy suppose who has never learned what a triangle is much less what any particular species of Triangle is and tell him a Triangle is a space comprehended by three right lines I say that the Boy as soon as he understands the meaning of these words will have acquired the general Idea of a Triangle If you doubt of it shew him a rectangular Triangle drawn upon paper and ask him what it is he will without hesitation tell you it is a Triangle afterwards shew him separately all the other species of Triangles and you will find he knows them every one to be a Triangle His Idea of a Triangle therefore is general inasmuch as it suits all the particular species And the acquiring this Idea either abstract or general in Teacher or Scholar seems to me to be attended with so little difficulty that I think Mr  Locke  has said full enough when he declares that the first  requires some pains and skill to form it  and it is to me surprising to hear a Gentleman of your penetration  profess that  after reiterated endeavours to apprehend the general Idea of a Triangle you have found it altogether incomprehensible  Put your self but once in the case of a Learner endeavour to divest your mind of all your preconceived Geometrical Ideas and then turn to  Euclid  's definitions and I'll venture to assure you you will find no more difficulty in apprehending the general Idea of a Triangle than in apprehending the Idea of an obliqueangled or of a scalene Triangle or even that of an Angle alone there being no objection against the first but what may with equal reason be brought against any of the others as will easily appear to him that considers that an angle in general an obliqueangled Triangle in general and a scalene Triangle in general can no where exist but in Idea only any more than a Triangle in general  Having premised thus much concerning the abstract or general Idea of a Triangle I come now to examine into your charge against Mr  Locke  and in the first place I must take notice that this charge is introduced in an unfair and unjust manner  If any one were able to introduce that Idea into my mind  say you  it must be the Author of  the Essay concerning Human Understanding  c  Let us therefore see how this celebrated Author describes the general or abstract Idea of a Triangle  Would not any body imagine from these words that Mr  Locke  were here purposely  describing  this Idea in order to  introduce it into the mind  of one who had it not already If that were his intention it is certainly a most miserable description since no person living who does not already know what a Triangle is can ever have  that Idea introduced into his mind  from what Mr  Locke  here lays down And yet that Idea is introduced into the mind with all the ease in the world by what he gives us to understand in another  Essay on Hum Underst B II C    S    place that the Idea of a Triangle is that of  three lines including a space  Could he possibly talk so clearly in one place and so cloudily in another if his intention were the same in both Is it not plain to any one who attentively reads the passage you refer to that his intention there was not to  describe  the general Idea of a Triangle but only to shew from the seeming inconsistencies in that Idea supposed to be already known that it required some pains and skill to form it as well as other  abstract Ideas Observe his words  For abstract Ideas are not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones If they seem so to grown men 'tis only because by constant and familiar use they are made so For when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general Ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine For example Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general Idea of a Triangle Which yet is none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult For it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once In effect it is something imperfect that cannot exist an Idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together  We come now to the manifest staring contradictions contained in this Idea of a Triangle the first of which I suppose is contained in these words  all and none of these at once  The  Enantiosis  I confess is pretty strong and yet the meaning of it is plainly  no more than this that the general Idea of a Triangle is a part of the Idea of every species of Triangles here enumerated but is not the intire Idea of any one of them is common to them all and confined to none  It is something imperfect that cannot exist  may possibly be another of your contradictions It does not appear so to me For every individual Triangle every Triangle that can exist must be something more than a space included by three lines it must also have the characteristick mark of some one of the particular species of Triangles without which it would be  imperfect it could not exist  which is what Mr  Locke  here says of a Triangle in general  But the great contradiction of all seems to lie in the two following propositions which are brought together from different parts of Mr  Locke  's works and set to stare one another in the face to disgrace their Author  It is an Idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together  Ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent Ideas are put together cannot so much as exist in the mind  Here Sir I strongly apprehend you are fallen into one of those traps which this Great Man would sometimes divert himself with setting to catch unwary cavillers the  Homines stolidos ad depugnandum paratos  that I mentioned a while ago Had his first proposition run thus It is an Idea wherein several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together it would undoubtedly have been contradictory to the second But that is not the case pray observe the words of this cautious and accurate Writer It is an Idea wherein SOME PARTS OF several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together Now we know that the several compound Ideas of a rectangled an oblique and an acuteangled Triangle are different and inconsistent one with another No two of them can be put together so as jointly to exist or be conceived in the mind Likewise the several compound Ideas of an equilateral equicrural and scalene triangle are inconsistent with one another But yet some parts of one of these inconsistent Ideas are not only consistent but are perfectly the same with some parts of another To shew this I beg leave to divide two of these inconsistent Ideas into several parts  The compound Idea of a rectangled Triangle may be divided into these parts  The compound Idea of an acuteangled Triangle may be divided into these parts  A plain space  A plain space  Comprehended by right lines  Comprehended by right lines  Three in number  Three in number  Containing three angles  Containing three angles  One right two acute  All acute  There is we see no difference between the four first parts of the compound Idea of a rectangled Triangle and the four first parts of that of an acuteangled Triangle it is owing to the fifth part alone of each Idea that these two Ideas are different and inconsistent And as it is easy to see that these four first parts are the same in all the other particular Species of Triangles and that the same four parts do compose the general Idea of a Triangle it is plain that the general Idea of a Triangle is an Idea wherein SOME PARTS OF several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together  The first therefore of the two propositions  in question is undoubtedly true and as these parts are no way inconsistent with one another it is manifest that the second proposition is not contradictory or at all repugnant to the first  I come now Sir to take my leave of you and hope that if an honest zeal for truth in the first place and in the second for the reputation of those Gentlemen to whom I conceive the whole body of mankind at least I must acknowledge my self to be highly indebted has given occasion not only of differing from you but even of reprehending you with the utmost freedom wherever I thought the truth and your behaviour required it you will not impute the liberty I have taken to any disrespect for your person which I am an utter stranger to though I have a very great esteem and value for your uncommon abilities and many of your writings and am with sincere respect
