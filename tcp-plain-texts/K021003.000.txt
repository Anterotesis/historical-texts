SCENE I  A Garden  Enter  Maria  weeping follow'd by  Jacinta  JACINTA  _WHY do you sigh and thus give way to Grief  And discontented wander up and down  Disclose the Torments of your troubled Breast  Sorrows reveal'd the Burthen lighter grows  And if I bring no Balsam to your Wounds  Your Trust but leaves you as you were before  Mar  Thou hast been ever faithful just and kind  Therefore I will unload my secret Soul  And tell the Troubles of my tortur'd Breast  This Day my cruel Father has resolv'd  In Spight of all my Tears and bitter Anguish  To wed me to the Man I most abhor  Tho' well he knows  Sebastian  has my Heart  Jac  If Fathers thus forget Paternal Love  The Ties of Duty shou'd no longer bind  Mar  Sebastian  tortur'd with ten thousand Woes  This Moment waits to know my last Resolve  His Love has urg'd me to forsake this Place  And fly with him to some more friendly Clime  Jac  There is no other Way to shun your Fate  Mar  The Tyrant Love too strongly takes his Part  His Throne is fixt and reigns within my Heart  AIR I As the Snow in Vallies lying  If the dear and faithful Lover  Pleads our Passion to discover  Cupid  then will take his Part  Cupid  then  c  Reason holds the Reins no longer  Powerful Love will prove the stronger  And by Storm will seize the Heart  And by Storm  c  Enter  Sebastian  Seb  Oh my  Maria  must I live or die  This Moment is the Crisis of my Fate  Pronounce my Doom and give me Life or Death  Mar  What will the medling World say of my Fame  To leave my Father Friends and native Home  And turn a willing Wanderer o'er the World  Seb  Alas my Fair thy Virtue is a Proof  Against the Malice of censorious Tongues  I'll be thy Lover Father Brother All  Trust in my Faith that never shall deceive thee  Mar  Too well thou know'st the Weakness of my Heart  That smiling listens to the Charmer's Lure  But oh  Sebastian  will Love always last  Our Morning's Sun may bring a Cloudy Noon  Illfeatur'd Poverty may come upon us  And drive the downy Thoughts of Love away  Seb  I have a wealthy Uncle lives in  Spain  The Consul of the  British  Nation there  I am the Darling of his feeble Age  Thither we'll fly and leave our Cares behind  He will protect us from the Frowns of Fortune  And make us happy in our virtuous Loves  Mar  The Hand of Heav'n I hope will point our Way  And guide us by his nevererring Ray  Seb  Oh thou hast rais'd me from the last Despair  And thy Consenting cures my wounded Soul  Let us be gone and leave this Shore behind  The Anchors weighing and the Sails unfurl'd  But yet one Pang I feel thro' all my Joy  That from my noble Brethren I must part  Those Men whose Lustre spreads from Pole to Pole  Possessing every Virtue of the Soul  But yet all Climes the Brotherhood adorn  As smiling  Phoebus  gilds the Rosie Morn  Let Love and Friendship then our Cares confound  And  Halcyon  Days be one eternal Round  Exeunt  SCENE II A Hall in old  Moody  's House  Enter  Moody Caelia  and  Lettice  Mood
