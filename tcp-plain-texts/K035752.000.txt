 AN EPISTLE FROM A Lady in  ENGLAND  TO A GENTLEMAN at  AVIGNON  LONDON  Printed for  J Tonson  at  Shakespear'sHead  overagainst  Katharinestreet  in the  Strand    AN EPISTLE FROM A Lady in  ENGLAND  TO A GENTLEMAN at  AVIGNON  TO Thee dear Rover and thy vanquish'd Friends  The Health she wants thy gentle  Chloe  sends  Though much You suffer think I suffer more  Worse than an Exile on my Native Shore  Companions in your Master's Flight you roame  Unenvy'd by your haughty Foes at home  Forever near the Royal Outlaw's side  You share his Fortunes and his Hopes divide  On glorious Schemes and Thoughts of Empire dwell  And with Imaginary Titles swell  Say for thou know'st I own his sacred Line  The Passive Doctrine and the Right Divine  Say what new Succours do's the Chief prepare  The Strength of Armies Or the Force of Pray'r  Do's he from Heav'n or Earth his Hopes derive  From Saints Departed Or from Priests Alive  Nor Saints nor Priests can  Brunswick  's Troops withstand  And Beads drop useless through the Zealot's Hand  Heav'n to our Vows may Future Kingdoms owe  But Skill and Courage win the Crowns below  E're to thy Cause and Thee my Heart inclin'd  Or Love to Party had seduce'd my Mind  In Female Joys I took a dull Delight  Slept all the Morn and Punted half the Night  But now with Fears and publick Cares possest  The Church the Church forever breaks my Rest  The  PostBoy  on my Pillow I explore  And sift the News of ev'ry foreign Shore  Studious to find new Friends and new Allies  What Armies march from  Sueden  in Disguise  How  Spain  prepares her Banners to unfold  And  Rome  deals out her Blessings and her Gold  Then o'er the Map my Finger taught to stray  Cross many a Region marks the winding Way  From Sea to Sea from Realm to Realm I rove  And grow a mere Geographer by Love  But still  Avignon  and the pleasing Coast  That holds Thee banish'd claims my Care the most  Oft on the wellknown Spot I fix my Eyes  And Span the Distance that between us lies  Let not our  James  tho' foil'd in Arms Despair  Whilst on his Side he reckons half the Fair  In  Britain  's lovely Isle a shining Throng  War in his Cause a thousand Beauties strong  Th' unthinking Victors vainly boast their Pow'rs  Be Theirs the Musquet while the Tongue is Ours  We Reason with such Fluency and Fire  The Beaux we baffle and the Learned tire  Against her Prelates plead the Churche's Cause  And from our Judges vindicate the Laws  Then mourn not hapless Prince thy Kingdoms lost  A Crown tho' late thy sacred Brow may boast  Heav'n seems through Us thy Empire to decree  Those who Win Hearts have giv'n their Hearts to Thee  What Dames what Doctors in thy Cause combine  What Petticoats in Either Sex are Thine  Ha'st thou not heard that when profusely gay  Our welldrest Rivals grace'd their Sov'raign's Day  We stubborn Damsels met the publick View  In loathsome Wormwood and repenting Rue  What Whig but trembled when our spotless Band  In Virgin Roses whiten'd half the Land  Who can forget what Fears the Foe possest  When Oaken Boughs mark'd ev'ry loyal Breast  Less scar'd near  Medway  's Stream the  Norman  stood  When cross the Plain he spy'd a marching Wood  'Till near at hand a Gleam of Swords betray'd  The Youth of  Kent  beneath it's wandring Shade  Those who the Succours of the Fair despise  May find that we have Nails as well as Eyes  Thy Female Bands O Prince by Fortune crost  At least more Courage than thy Men may boast  Our Sex has dar'd the MuggHouse Chiefs to meet  And purchas'd Fame in many a wellfought Street  From  DruryLane  the Region of Renown  The Land of Love the  Paphos  of the Town  Fair Patriots sallying oft have put to flight  With all their Poles the Guardians of the Night  And bore with Screams of Triumph to their Side  The Leader's Staff in all its painted Pride  Nor fears the Hawker in her warbling Note  To vend the discontented Statesman's Thought  Tho' red with Stripes and recent from the Thong  Sore smitten for the Love of sacred Song  The tuneful Sisters still pursue their Trade  Like  Philomela  darkling in the Shade  Poor  Trott  attends forgetful of a Fare  And Hums in Concert o'er his Empty Chair  Mean while regardless of the Royal Cause  His Sword for  James  no Brother Sov'rain draws  The Pope himself surrounded with Alarms  To  France  his Bulls to  Corfu  sends his Arms  And though He hears his Darling Son's Complaint  Can hardly spare one Tutelary Saint  But lists them all to guard his own Abodes  And into Ready Money coyns his Gods  The dauntless  Suede  pursu'd by vengeful Foes  Scarce keeps his own hereditary Snows  Nor must the friendly Roof of kind  Lorrain  With Feasts regale our Garter'd Youth again  Safe  Barleduc  within thy silent Grove  The Pheasant now may perch the Hare may rove  The Knight who aims unerring from afar  Th' Advent'rous Knight now quits the Sylvan War  Thy brinded Boars may slumber undismay'd  Or grunt secure beneath the Chesnut Shade  Inconstant  Orleans  still we mourn the Day  That trusted  Orleans  with Imperial Sway  Far o'er the  Alps  our helpless Monarch sends  Far from the Call of his desponding Friends  Such are the Terms to gain  Britainnia  's Grace  And such the Terrours of the  Brunswick  Race  Was it for this the Sun's whole Lustre fail'd  And sudden Midnight o'er the Noon prevail'd  For this did Heav'n display to Mortal Eyes  Aërial Knights and Combates in the Skies  Was it for this  Northumbrian  Streams look'd Red  And  Thames  driv'n backward show'd his Secret Bed  False Auguries th' insulting Victor's Scorn  Ev'n our own Prodigies against us turn  O Portents constru'd on our Side in vain  Let never Tory trust Eclipse again  Run clear ye Fountains be at Peace ye Skies  And  Thames  henceforth to thy green Borders rise▪  To  Rome  then must the Royal Wand'rer go  And fall a Suppliant at the Papal Toe  His Life in Sloth inglorious must he wear  One half in Luxury and one in Pray'r  His Mind perhaps at length debauch'd with Ease  The proffer'd Purple and the Hat may please  Shall He whose Ancient Patriarchal Race  To mighty  Nimrod  in One Line we trace▪  In solemn Conclave sit devoid of Thought  And poll for Points of Faith his Trusty Vote  Be summon'd to his Stall in time of Need  And with his casting Suffrage fix a Creed  Shall He in Robes on stated Days appear  And  English  Hereticks curse once a Year  Garnet  and  Faux  shall He with Pray'rs invoke  And beg that  Smithfield  Piles once more may smoak  Forbid it Heav'n my Soul to Fury wrought  Turns almost  Hanoverian  at the Thought  From  James  and  Rome  I feel my Heart decline  And fear O  Brunswick  'twill be wholly Thine  Yet still his Share thy Rival will contest  And still the Double Claim divides my Breast  The Fate of  James  with pitying Eyes I view  And wish my Homage were not  Brunswick  's Due  To  James  my Passions and my Weakness guide  But Reason sways me to the Victor's Side  Though griev'd I speak it let the Truth appear  You know my Language and my Heart sincere  In vain did Falshood his fair Fame disgrace  What force had Falshood when He show'd his Face  In vain to War our boastful Clans were led  Heaps driv'n on Heaps in the dire Shock they fled  France  shuns his Wrath nor raises to our Shame  A second  Dunkirk  in Another Name  In  Britain  's Funds their Wealth all  Europe  throws  And up the  Thames  the World's Abundance flows  Spite of feign'd Fears and artificial Cries  The Pious Town sees Fifty Churches rise  The Hero triumphs as his Worth is known  And sits more firmly on his Shaken Throne  To my sad Thought no Beam of Hope appears  Through the long Prospect of succeeding Years  The Son aspiring to his Father's Fame  Shows all his Sire Another and the Same  He blest in lovely  Carolina  's Arms  To future Ages propagates Her Charms  With Pain and Joy at strife I often trace  The mingled Parents in each Daughter's Face  Half sick'ning at the Sight too well I spie  The Father's Spirit through the Mother's Eye  In vain new Thoughts of Rage I entertain  And strive to Hate their Innocence in vain  O Princess happy by thy Foes confest  Blest in thy Husband in thy Children blest  As They from Thee from Them New Beauties born  While  Europe  lasts shall  Europe  's Thrones adorn  Transplanted to each Court in times to come  Thy Smile Celestial and unfading Bloom  Great  Austria  's Sons with softer Lines shall grace  And smooth the Frowns of  Bourbon  's haughty Race  The fair Descendents of thy sacred Bed  Widebranching o'er the Western World shall spread  Like the fam'd  Banian  Tree whose pliant Shoot  To Earthward bending of it's self takes Root  Till like their Mother Plant ten thousand stand  In verdant Arches on the fertile Land  Beneath her Shade the tawny  Indian  roves  Or hunts at large through the wide echoing Groves  O Thou to whom these mournful Lines I send  My promis'd Husband and my dearest Friend  Since Heav'n appoints this favour'd Race to reign  And Blood has drench'd the  Scottish  Fields in vain  Must I be wretched and thy Flight partake  Or wilt not Thou for thy lov'd  Chloe  's sake  Tir'd out at length submit to Fate's Decree  If not to  Brunswick  O return to me  Prostrate before the Victor's Mercy bend  What spares whole Thousands may to Thee extend  Should blinded Friends thy doubtful Conduct blame  Great  Brunswick  's Virtues will secure thy Fame  Say these invite thee to approach his Throne  And own the Monarch Heav'n vouchsafes to own  The World convinc'd thy Reasons will approve  Say this to Them but swear to Me 'twas Love  FINIS
