 THE Family Instructor IN Three PARTS  I Relating to Fathers and Children  II To Masters and Servants  III To Husbands and Wives  The Second Edition  Corrected by the Author  LONDON  Printed for  Eman Matthews  at the Bible in  Paternosterrow    THE PREFACE  THE First Edition of this Work was so ill Printed and by Reason of the Author's Absence from the Press was so uncorrect that it stood more than ordinarily in Need of the Help of a good Introduction yet it is hoped the Work has not dishonour'd the Reverend Person who did it the Favour to give it the first Recommendation  The Ʋsefulness of the Subject and the Honesty of the Design has prevailed to give it a good Reception in the World And notwithstanding the Casual Imperfections of the First Part some good Men have been pleased to accept the Performance to usher it into the World much to its Advantage and to recommend it as well from the Pulpit as from the Press  The Ʋnworthy Author earnestly desir'd and to his utmost endeavour'd to be for ever conceal'd not that he was asham'd of the Work or sees any Reason yet to be so professing to have a firm Belief that he was not without a more than ordinary Presence and Assistance of the Divine Spirit in the Performance But being fully satisfied with the Prospect of doing Good by it He desir'd his  Praise might not be of Men but of God  To this End he took such Measures at first for effectually preserving the Secret and for his entire remaining in the Obscurity he desir'd that for some time after the Publication he continued unguess'd at and he flatter'd himself for a while that the Author would be no farther enquired into  But Satan hindred  The Success of the Work and the many Testimonies given to the good Effect it has had in Families notwithstanding their Knowledge of the Author has fully deliver'd him from the Discouragement he was under on that Occasion and this alone has prevail'd with him for a Second Edition which he had for sometime resolv'd against it was not without Reason that he had great Apprehensions least some Men suffering their Prejudices to prevail even over their Zeal for publick Good might be tempted to lay the Imperfections of the Author of this Book as a stumbling Block in the way of those who might otherwise receive Benefit by it and so the good Effect of his Labour might be in Part obstructed  But God who as before he firmly believes directed his Hand in the Work has given his visible Blessing to it and has thereby from Heaven own'd the Author to his inexpressible Satisfaction and Joy  To his Name be all the Praise  AFTER THIS Let who will reject him or his Book it is not possible to give him the least Disturbance  AFTER THIS if any Man will rob himself or any one else of the Good this Work might otherwise do  at his Door be the Sin  The Present Edition is more carefully corrected and the Errors of the Press are so few and of so small Consequence that an ordinary Judgment will correct them in the reading  The Author in revising it has made no Additions thinking his first Design fully exhausted and also esteeming it injurious to those who have bought the first to make a Second Edition vary so much from it as to make them think their Money lost and to oblige them to buy it over again  Some few Things are omitted indeed but not considerable and those principally in the  Notes  from the meer Sense the Author had of the Comment's being less beautiful than the Text and that others are able to make better Annotations than himself  The whole Work being design'd both to divert and instruct the Author has endeavoured to adapt it as much as possible to both those Ʋses from whence some have call'd it  a Religious Play  It would more have answer'd that Title had the Author's first Design been pursued which was to have made it a Drammatick Poem But the Subject was too solemn and the Text too copious to suffer the Restraint on one Hand or the Excursions on the other which the Decoration of a Poem would have made necessary  As to its being called  a Play be it called so if they please  it must be confest some Parts of it are too much acted in many Families among us The Author wishes that either all  our Plays  were as useful for the Improvement and Entertainment of the World or that  they were  less encouraged  The same Reasons which obliged the Author to conceal his Name at the first Publication prevails with him to forbear it now so that tho' he neither declines owning the Work or being known by his Name yet referring it to Providence he leaves the Discovery to go no farther than others think fit to carry it  THE FamilyInstructor  PART I  The Introduction to the First PART  _CAtechising of Children and instructing them in the Principles of the Christian Religion has been a Practice in the Church as Ancient as Religion it self and besides the Nature of the Thing which requires it was deduc'd from that strict Injunction laid upon the Children of  Israel  Deut  And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy Children  speaking of the Laws and Statutes which God then commanded  Moses  And again  Deut    But teach them to thy Sons and thy Sons Sons  It is not the Design of this Undertaking to give a List of Authorities in Scripture for Catechising and Instructing of Children or the Commendations and Testimonies given there to those that did instruct their Children in the Knowledge and Practice of Religion That eminent Text is sufficient to this being the blessed Character given to  Abraham  from God himself  I know  Abraham says the Lord  Gen    that he will Command his Children and his Houshold after him  c  But we live in an Age that does not want so much to know their Duty  as to practise it  not so much  to be taught  as to be made obedient to what they have  already learnt  and therefore I shall take up no Time in proving this Matter to be a Duty there's hardly a Wretch so hardned but will readily acknowledge it  But we are I say arrived at a Time in which Men will frankly own a thing to be their Duty which  at the same time  they dare omit the Practice of and innumerable Arts Shifts and Turns they find out to make that omission easie to themselves and excusable to others  One Part of this Work is pointed  at such  if possible to make them blush at their unacountable Rashness and to shame them out of such a fordid inconsistent Course as that of living in the allow'd Omission of what they acknowledge to be their Duty  The way I have taken for this is  entirely New  and at first  perhaps  it may appear something  Odd  and the Method may be contemned But let such blame their own more irregular Tempers that must have every thing turned into new Models must be touch'd with  Novelty  and have their Fancies humour'd  with the Dress  of a thing so that if it be what has been said over and over a thousand  times yet if it has but a different colour'd Coat or a new Feather in its Cap it pleases and wins upon them whereas the same Truths written in the divinest Stile in the World would be flat stale and unpleasant without it  If then after all the pains which have been taken by ministerial Labour and Instruction and by the pressing Exhortations and moving Arguments of eminent Divines even of all Opinions in their Writings on this Subject this mean and familiar Method should by its Novelty prevail this will be a happy Undertaking but no Reproach at all to the Labours of others  In the pursuit of this Book care is taken to avoid Distinctions of Opinion as to Church of  England  or  Dissenter  and no Offence can be taken here either on the one Side or the other as I hope  both  are Christians so  both  are treated here as such and the Advice is impartially directed  to both  without the least Distinction  If those who call themselves Christians and Protestants will not instruct their Children and Servants here they will find their Children and Servants instructing them and reproving them too and both they and their Children may here meet with Instructions together  The Father represented here appears knowing enough but seems to be one of those professing Christians who acknowledging God in their Mouths  yet take no effectual Care  to honour him with their Practice that live in a Round of Religion as a thing of course have not the Power of Godliness nor much of the Form a kind of a Negative Christian  a GodIthank thee Pharisee  found in knowledge but negligent in Conversation Orthodox in Opinion but Hetrodox in Practice and that I have found out such a Person is to signify that let  him be  where  he will and  who  he will this Work is calculated to reprove and admonish him  The Mother here represented is likewise a formal looseliving Christian a Protestant Professor of Religion without the Practice of it  but yet  she is a  Professor  one that knows how to talk of Religion and makes a show to belong to it butalas for the rest the Consequence will appear in the Book in which I doubt a great many may see their own Picture drawn May the Sight of it have the same healing convincing Efficacy as appears upon the Persons here whose Story is therefore brought for an Example to them  May they see it  and blush like the Father here mention'd  Like him may they  be asham'd of their Likeness  May they see it  and  like him  effectually reform the dreadful Practise  This would compleatly answer the End and Design of the Author of this Book and rejoice the Hearts of all serious Christians in the Nation  The Child who is here made the Inquirer has  no Questions  put into its Mouth but what are Natural and Rational consistent with Principle and as near as could be are such as are proper even to a Child none but what the Author wishes every body would put seriously to themselves as often as they look about them in the World and none but what even a Child is capable to enquire into The Author has endeavour'd to produce the Questions with  an Air of meer Nature  Innocence and Childhood  yet such  as being naturally adapted to the general State of things may be apposit and direct  Such as  being the meer product of the most common Reasonings and even of the Understanding of Children a Child's Understanding may justly be supposed to have proposed them  Tho' much of the Story is Historical and might be made appear to be true in Fact yet the Author resolving not to give the least hint that should lead to Persons has been obliged to leave it Uncertain to the Reader whether it be a History or a Parable believing it may be either way adapted to the sincere Design Which is to reprove those Parents who neglect the Instruction of their Children And to direct young Persons in their first Reflections guiding them to enquire about themselves their  Original  their  State  their  Progress  in this World the reason of their  being born into it  their passing  out of it  and  which is the main Cogitation  their Condition  beyond it  The Method  is New  as is said above but perhaps may be more pleasing Any Thing or any Method if we may but bring the main End to pas  viz  to bring Young and Old to set earnestly and heartily about the great Work of serving glorifying and obeying the God that made them  The Child is supposed to be come up to such Years as to be thinking and inquiring suppose about five or six Years old and as Nature is always prompting the Soul to be searching after something which it did not know before so that Inquisitive Temper is  in some  sedater than in others however our little Child asks but very little of his Father but what a Child  at that Age  may be very capable of asking  The Scene of this little Action is not laid very remote or the Circumstance obscure the Father walking in a Field behind his Garden finds one of his Children wandred out all alone under a Row or Walk of Trees sitting upon a little rising Ground by it self looking about and mighty busie pointing this way and that way sometimes  up  and sometimes  down  and sometimes  to its self  so that the Father coming unperceived pretty near  found the little Creature very busie  about something  he could not tell what when the Father after much Observation and some Surprise discover+ing himself asks the Child  What he was doing  and so sits down by him which Question begins the FIRST DIALOGUE  I Was looking up there  says the Child  pointing up in the Air  Fath  Well and what did you point  thither  for and then point  to the Ground  and then to your self afterwards what was that about  Child  I was  a wondring  Father  Fath  At what  my Dear  Child  I was wondring what Place that is  Fath  That is the  Air  the  Sky  Child  And what is beyond that Father  Fath  Beyond  my Dear  why above it all  there is Heaven  Child  Who lives there Father My Nurse talks of Heaven sometimes and says  GOD  is in Heaven  Is that the Place up there  Fath  Yes  my Dear  Child  Why  Father  does God dwell there Sure it is a fine Place how do we know that he dwells there Have you been there  Eather  Fath  No  my dear  but we know it two ways The Scripture tells us Heaven is his Throne that he has spoken from Heaven and has been seen come down from Heaven and the  Son of God  was seen to ascend into Heaven Besides  Child  he made Heaven for his Eternal Habitation and the making of and preserving all things is a Token of his Being and of his being  GOD  Child  But  dear Father  my Nurse tells me that God  made me too  and that was it I was pointing to my self about if God made me how  did I come from thence hither  Father  I was a wondring for 'tis a huge Way  Fath  Child  GOD made you by the Course of Nature having made the whole World at first and all the things therein he gave a Command and with that Command gave a Power to Nature to grow and increase by Vertue of that Command every thing increases and every Creature is produced by its own kind but at first all was made by  his infinite Power  who made the whole World  Child  Why  Father  did God make all those Creatures we see about us this Grass and the Trees and these Cows and Horses and the Dogs and Cats and every thing  Fath  Yes my dear  He made  Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that in them is  as you read in your Commandments Child  Child  And what a Creature am I  Father  I an't like them I can speak they can't speak  Father  Fath  No Child  You are not like them GOD has made you a rational Creature and given you a SOUL  Child  A Soul Father  WHAT IS THAT  Fath  It is a Part of his own Image stampt upon you and the Breath of an Invisible Power by which you can think of things to come and remember things past reflect argue and know both your self and Him that made you  Child  Why dear Father  cannot the Horses and Cows do so too  Fath  No Child not at all  Child  Why  has he made me a better Creature than they  Fath  Yes he has  and has given them to you for Food and Service don't you see that we eat them and ride upon them and the like  Child  I am glad I am made a better Creature than they I'd thank him for it  if I knew how  should I not do so Father  Fath  Indeed you should Child  Child  But you never told me so before  Father  as I remember  Fath  Not so often as I should have done my Child but remember it now my Dear  and kisses him  Child  So I will  But how must I thank him for it Father  Fath  You must pray to him to bless you Child and then give Thanks to him for your Creation and Preservation  Child  Do you do so  Father  Fath  Yes Child  Child  O ho because I never heard you do so  Father  Fath  Well  but you have been taught  Child  Yes  my Mother and my Nurse taught me to say my Prayers but I don't see a Word there that thanks God for making me a Boy and not a Horse or a Cow or giving me a Soul  Father  Fath  But it is included  Child  when in the beginning of your Prayers you say  Our Father  for God is a Father in giving you a Soul as well as a Creator in making your Body  Child  But may I not  say so  in my Prayers  then  Fath  Yes Child if you were taught  Child  Indeed I can say that without teaching sure I can thank God for giving me a Soul and making me better than the Horses and the Cows without my Nurse I wish I had known it sooner  Father  won't God be angry that I never thank'd him for it yet  Fath  I hope not Child  since you did not know it  Child  Dear Father  won't God be angry with you that you never told me before  Fath  Indeed he has reason  Child  Dear Father  why did you not tell me  Here the Child cries and the Father blusht or at least ought to have done so  Fath  Well Child  do not cry come take care you thank God for it  now you do know it  Child  Indeed I'll thank him for it for my Heart jumps within me to think he has made me better than other Creatures  Fath  My dear Child  The Father is mov'd with the Child's Expressions and kisses him  Child  But  dear Father  if God should be angry with me for not thanking him will he not take this Soul away again and turn me into a Horse or a Cow  Fath  No Child God does not punish that way it is true GOD may take away the use of it take away the Reason or the Speech or the Senses and leave you in some kind worse than if you had no Soul at all he may do all these things and more  Child  Then should not I when I say my Prayers remember to pray that God would not be angry  that I never thank'd him for it before  Fath  Your Nurse will teach you to do so  Child  Indeed  Father  I'll do that  whether my Nurse teaches me or no  sure if God made me I may pray to him not to be angry with me If you was angry with me  Father  I don't want my Nurse to teach me to come and say  My dear Father do not be angry  Besides if God has made me so much better than other things  won't he teach me  to thank him for it  Fath  I hope he will Child  Child  But  dear Father  wherefore has God made me better than other Creatures had he not some reason for doing so  Fath  No reason  Child  on thy side  Child  But does not God expect then that I should do something that the Cows and Horses cannot do is there not something for me to do for it  Fath  Yes indeed there is Child  Child  What is that Father  For I have been wondring what my Business is in this World as well as how I came hither what am I to do here  Fath  You are to live here to the Glory of him that made you  Child  How's that  Father  Fath  You must fear God and keep his Commandments  Child  What the Ten Commandments Father  Fath  Yes my Dear  Child  Truly if God has made me and made me  better than the rest of his Creatures  and can take away from me  as you said Father  all that he has given me and make me worse than the Cows and the Horses sure I should do what he commands me  Fath  That's true Child  Child  But mayn't I do more than that  may'nt I love him too  Father for sure he loves me or else he would not have made me so and given me all this  Fath  Yes  Child  you must love him too  Child  But  Father  that is not in my Commandments won't God be angry with me if I should love him  Fath  No  Child  to obey  God  and to fear  God  is to love  God  for to fear him as your Father and to serve him as your Father is to fear and serve him as a Child and that is to love him  Don't you love me my dear  Child  Yes  dear Father  Fath  Why do you do what I bid you and why do you cry when I am angry with you  Child  Because I love you  dear Father  Fath  So if you fear God and serve God as your Father and as his Child that is loving him for  they that love him keep his Commandments  Child  Indeed I think it need not be put into my Commandments for sure when we know what he has done for us to make us Souls and not make us like the Horses and Cows we must needs  love him  Don't you love him  Father  Fath  Yes  my Dear  Child  And do not every body else love him  Father  Fath  No Child  a great many wicked Children and wicked People don't love him  Child  And has he given them Souls too  Father  and made them better than the Beasts as he has done for me  Fath  Yes Child  Child  But  sure  they do not know it then  Fath  They do not think of it  as thou dost  my Dear  Child  'T may be  their Fathers  and  Mothers  never told them of it  Father  as you do me now  Fath  They don't  so much  as they should nor  so soon  as they should  Child  I wish you had told me of it sooner  Father  Fath  I hope 'tis not  too late now  Child  Child  But  Father  if those wicked Children do not love God nor thank God for giving them Souls and making them better Creatures than the Horses and Cows is not God angry with them for it  Fath  Yes  my dear Child  God is very angry with them  Child  But why does he not take away their Souls again and turn them into Horses and Cows or take away the use of their Reason and leave them worse than the Beasts as you said he could do Father Sure God is not angry with them at all  Fath  Yes my Dear God is angry with them for all that but he lets them  go on  sometimes till they amend and repent and turn to God again and then he forgives them  other times  he lets them run on and grow worse and punishes them for all together at last  Child  That's a sad thing Father sure God is very angry when he lets them go on and takes no Care of them Father is n't he  Fath  Yes indeed  it is a sign of his severest Anger when he lets them go on and does not punish them  till last  for 'tis a Signal that he has no Thought of Mercy in Store for them  Child  And when God leaves them so are they not sorry for it Father  Fath  No no  they always grow worse and worse till they grow meer Reprobates and hardned against him that made them  Child  They are sad Folks indeed but Father does not God destroy them at last  Fath  He does  worse  Child he punishes them Everlastingly in Hell  Child  Dear Father don't let me make God angry with me as they do won't you tell me what I must do to save me from God's being angry  Fath  Yes  I will  Child  Child  But you never did yet Father I am afraid he is angry with me already for I am almost six Years old and never thank'd him nor lov'd him nor fear'd him nor nothing Father he has let me alone and let me  go on  just as you say he does the wicked Folks I am sure he must be angry  with me and he will punish me Everlastingly  in Hell  as you said Father  O what must I do  Here Conviction works in the Child the Child weeps  Fath  Why Child did you not do all this  Child  Dear Father I never knew  what God was  or what he had done for me you never told me a Word of him  in all my Life till now  I never heard you pray to him  in all my Life  I know nothing of him how should I Father  Fath  But Child your Nurse and your Mother  taught you  that  God made you  Child  Yes  but they never told me  what God was  and what  he had done  for me and what  I was to do again  I thought nothing not I Father I liv'd just as I  saw you live  Father I never pray'd to God in all my Life Father  Fath  Why Child did not your Mother teach you to say your Prayers every Night and Morning  Child  Yes Father I said the Prayers over but I never thought a word what they meant I only said them by rote sure God does not take notice of that  does he  Father If he does  our Parrot can pray  as well as I  Fath  True  Child God requires the Heart and regards no Prayers but what the Heart joins in  Child  You say  I may  pray to God for what I want and  I may  thank him for making me and for making me better than the Horses and Cows  Fath  Yes  I do say so  Child  But Father am I to do nothing else Did God make me for nothing Have I no other Business now I am made What do other Folks do that are made as I am  Fath  Yes Child you were made  to serve him  You know your  Catechise  Child  What's that the Questions and Answers my Nurse taught me  Fath  Yes the Questions and Answers There you are told your Business here is to serve God  Child  Dear Father did God make me to serve him  Fath  Yes Child  he made you to serve him  Child  And do you serve him FatherWhat is it to serve him How must I do it I would fain serve him because he has made me and made me better than the Horses and Cows  Here the Father weeps and speaking to  himself  with a Sigh says Lord how this Child is made to sting my Soul to the quick  God knows I have neither  served him  nor taught these dear little Creatures to do it  as I should have done  The Father was so struck with the Child's Question  viz    Do you serve him Father  that he gives no present Answer and the little inquisitive Creature goes on again  Child  Dear  Father  may not I be taught how to serve  God  Fath  Yes  my Dear  says the Father  Child  Will you teach me  Father  Fath  Yes Child  Child  Why you never did yet Father may be I ben't big enough yet when shall I be big enough Father when I am a Man  Fath  You may learn to  serve God  tho' you are a Child  Child  Does my Brother know how to serve God Father  he is a great Boy  and I never saw you teach himCan you teach me Father  Fath  God will teach you himself  Child  Child  God teach me himself  How can that be  Fath  He has many was of teaching  Child  viz by his Word his Ministers and his Spirit  Child  What are they  Father  you said just now  you would teach me  Fath  I may teach you too Child but the Word of God is given to teach you Ministers are sent to instruct by that Word and Parents are Ministers of God to instruct their Families and Children and the Spirit of God is given to seal the Instruction and make it effectual  Child  Do  the Fathers  teach their Children  Fath  Yes 'tis their Duty  to do so  Child  And be they Ministers to their Families  Fath  So far as to instruct and teach their Children  they are  my Dear  Child  And when will you be a Minister  Father  that I may be instructed how to serve God  Fath  My Dear I am so much a Minister at any time  Child  I wonder  Fath  What do you wonder at  my Dear  Child  Dear Father you say the Fathers are to teach their Children and are Ministers to their Families and you are a Minister and  yet I was never taught  I wonder what all this is for I have never been taught any thing but to play and sing the Song my Nurse teaches me and read in my Sister's SongBook  Fath  Well  my Dear  you shall not want teaching  Child  Will you teach me to serve God Father  Fath  Yes  My dear  Child  I am glad of it  I would fain serve God  Father for I  Conviction of Sin thus working up to a love to God a fear of God and a desire of serving God  which is Holiness  may be very well allowed here to be an Appearance of converting Grace in the Heart of a little One  The Father takes notice of it as such  love him already  dearly  Fath  That is a true Principle to begin to serve God from  my dear  for God accepts no Fear but what is founded in  our Love  to him  pray then my dear  that he will increase your Love to him that you may serve him acceptably  Child  But dear Father you say God dwells up there in Heaven how can he hear  what I say  I can't speak loud enough to be heard so far and then tho' God could hear me how does he know when I speak as my Heart means  Fath  Yes Child God can hear and know for he is infinite  Child  What's that Father  Fath  Why Child it takes in all the Attributes of God  Child  I don't know them hard Words Father pray who is God and what is he can't you tell me Father so as I may understand it  Fath  It is very hard to give a Description of God to thy Understanding  my Dear  Child  And that is the reason you never said any thing of him to me Father is it not Must not I know who God is  till I am a Man  Father  Fath  Yes Child the Scripture says  Remember thy Greator in the Days if thy Youth  Child  But dear Father how shall I remember him I never heard any thing of him you never told me a Word of him yet  may be I an't a Youth yet  I long to be a Youth Father then you'll tell me who God is that I may remember him Father won't you  Fath  Dear Child You ought to have been told who God is before now  indeed I have neglected to instruct thee as I ought to have done  but I'll tell thee now  my Dear  Child  I'n't it too late Father O why would you neglect it Father Was you angry with me and would not Instruct me Father What if God should let me  go on now  and punish me Ever lastingly as you said I wish you had not neglected it Father  Fath  No Child it is not  too late  as you shall know by and by  Child  Tell me then Father what is God I would fain know God can't I see him to be sure I should know him if I could see him  Fath  No Child you cannot see him  no mortal Eye hath seen God at any time  Child  How shall I know then what he is  Fath  You must know God by the Scripture by reading and by meditating on the Revelation he has given of Himself there you must read of him in your Bible  Child  But Father I can't know him by reading my Book I have read my Book often but I know nothing about God can't you tell me what God is Father  Fath  No Words can express his Being or describe him  Child  How shall I know then by reading Father  Fath  I mean Child no Words can express it  fully  but the Spirit of God expounds the Word of God to us and by that Spirit he teaches us the Knowledge of Himself  Child  But you can tell me something of him Father you say he dwells up there what is he like Father  Fath  God is ONE infinite eternal incomprehensible invisible  BEING  the first Cause of all things the Giver of Life and Being to all things existing prior and therefore superior to all things infinitely perfect great holy just wise and good  Child  These are all hard Words Father how shall I understand them what do you mean by that word  INFINITE  for I see you put that in among the rest over and over  Fath  Why Child  INFINITE  is a Word to signifie something beyond all that is known and can only be described  in Thought  and those Thoughts only describe it by acknowledging that they cannot describe it but thus much you may understand by it  That God was  before  all things and shall continue  after  them that he had Power  to make  all things and by the same Power  preserves  and  maintains  all things and at last will put all things to an End Of the Particulars  you may understand thus  That he is infinitely  Great  signifies that he has made thee  my Dear  and all the People in the World that he is infinitely  Wise  signifies that he knows every Thought in the Heart and that implies that he hears every Word that is spoken and sees every Action that is done tho' never so secret that he is infinitely  Holy  and  Just  signifies that he hates all that is Evil and will punish it that he is infinitely  Good  signifies that he loves every good Action and will reward it That he is infinitely  Powerful  signifies that all other Powers move and act by him  for by him we live and mo  e and have our Being  Dost thou know him Child by this Description  Child  I am wondring Father I don't say I know  but I wonder  I am afraid I tremble Father sure God is very Dreadful  Fath  He is so Child  Child  Does he never speak Father can't I hear him speak  Fath  His Voice is terrible and he is a consuming Fire thou can'st not hear him speak  my Dear  Child  My Nurse said Father that  when it thunder'd  it was God spoke what is the Thunder and Lightning Father  is that God  Fath  No my Dear it is the Work of God  as all the rest of the Creation is his Work  but no otherwise the Voice of God is compared to Thunder indeed but God speaks to us in another kind of Voice  than that  Child  What Voice is that Father  Fath  The Voice of  the Gospel  and the Voice of  his Creatures  Child  What is that Father I never heard it may I hear that Voice I would fain hear God speak Father for I would do what he bids me and never make him angry  Fath  The  Gospel  is the Word of God the Message of Life sent from Heaven revealed in the Scriptures and preached by his Servants the Ministers this is the Voice I mean Child  Child  I don't understand it Father  Fath  Why  the Bible is the Word of God it was dictated by the Inspiration of the Spirit of God when you read the Bible you are to believe that God speaks to you in the Words you read  this is his Voice  Child  Why  does God speak to me when I read my Book Father  Fath  Yes  my Dear  Child  But then what if I do not understand it then it is nothing to me how shall I do to know what I read  Fath  You should be taught my Dear  Child  Who should teach me won't God make me understand what he says when I read my Book  Fath  Indeed I should have taught thee my Dear that is true  The Lord pardon me I have too much neglected it  says the Father aside and turning away his Head cannot refrain Tears  Child  Dear Father tell me what does my Book say What shall I learn there of God  Fath  You will learn that God is  from  the Beginning and  to  the End  from  Everlasting  to  Everlasting has  created  all things and  knows  all things  Child  Knows all things that's strange Father does God know all things  Fath  Yes my Dear  Child  If God knows all things he knows how old I am and that all this while I  never  thought of him nor served him and  never  knew any thing of him  till now  and he knows Father you  never  told me any thing of him  before now  sure he is very angry and will punish me what must I do  Here the Child weeps again  Fath  But God is Merciful too Child  Child  What is that Father  Fath  Why to those that repent of their Sins past and reform their Lives he is Merciful that is upon their Repentance he forgives them for the sake of  Jesus Christ  and is reconcil'd to them as though they had not sinned against him  Child  Jesus Christ  Father who is that  Fath  He is God  Child  Why Father you said  God was one first Being  is there more Gods than one is there two  Firsts My Commandments say there is but one God  Fath  No Child there is but one God yet  Jesus Christ  is essentially God tho' in a second Person he is God co equal coeternal that is the same in Being Nature and Attributes  God manifested in the flesh  sent from Heaven to redeem a lost World  Child  I don't understand a Word of all that Father what does it mean  Fath  Why Child you are to understand that when the first Man and Woman in the World was created God having made a Covenant or Agreement of Holiness and Life  with them  and  in them with all that should be born of them  they broke that Covenant and so involved all their Posterity in their Guilt the Punishment of which was Eternal Death But God who  as I told you child  was Infinitely Good  tho' provok'd utterly to destroy the whole Race for that Sin and being under the Engagement of that Covenant to do it  yet in the meer Operation of his own Goodness determin'd to recover sinful Men from the Gulph of Death To make this adequate or suitable to his own infinite Justice and Holiness he incarnated by a Miraculous Birth the Divine Nature into the Humane and caused this Blessed Conjunction to appear in the World in the likeness of Sinful Flesh so being infinite God on the one hand and Man on the other he became capable of being a compleat Sacrifice for Satisfaction of God's Justice and afterwards suffering the Divine Wrath made Peace for us  by the Blood of his Cross  was Crucified Dead and Buried as you say in your Creed rose again is ascended into Heaven sits at the Right Hand of Power and shall come again to Judge us all And this Child is call'd our Saviour  the Son of God and is indeed God himself  Child  I don't know how to understand all this Father  Fath  You must understand it gradually  my Dear  a little at a time you can understand  this  That we are all under a Sentence of Death for the First Man's Sin  By one Man Sin entred into the World and Death by Sin  Rom  Child  That is a strange thing Father What are we all condemn'd to suffer for that Man's Transgression  Fath  The Scripture is plain in it  by the Offence of One Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation  Rom  Child  But Father you said just now God would be reconcil'd to me if I repented and was sorry for my Sins  Fath  Yes Child I did so  Child  But how can that be when you say I shall be Condem'd for another Man's Transgression  Fath  It is very plain that the Effect of that first Man's Sin is a corrupt Taint which we all bring into the World with us and which we find upon our Nature by which we find a Natural Propensity in us to do Evil and no Natural Inclination to do Good and this we are to mourn over and lament as the Fountain of Sin from whence all our wicked Actions do proceed and this is call'd  Indwelling Sin  Child  Have I this in me Father  Fath  Yes Child Did you not say How should you do this or that for you were not taught You can be a naughty Boy without teaching  to Sin is natural  but you must be instructed and labour'd with to be a good Child  To Will is present  with me but how to Perform that which is Good I know not In me  that is  in my flesh dwelleth no good thing  Rom  Child  What will become of me then Father if I was Wicked when I was born  Fath  This my Dear is that which I nam'd  Jesus Christ  for  Child  Why what will he do for me  Fath  He will deliver thee from this Body of Death  Who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death I thank God through OR FOR Jesus Christ our Lord  Rom  Child  How can he do this  Fath  He has deliver'd us from the Curse of the Law by being made a Curse for us  and whereas we are not able to perform any thing he hath  fulfilled all Righteousness for us  if we believe in him for  being justified by Faith we have Peace with God  and so as  by the Disobedience of one Man many were made Sinners so by the Obedience of one  Christ  shall many be made Righteous  Rom  Child  But Father will  Jesus Christ  answer for me for that first Transgression and take away the Sentence you say I was under For if he does not I am undone to be sure I can't do it my self  Fath  Yes my Dear  the Blood of Christ cleanseth from all Sin  as well of Nature as of Life and  there is now no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus  Rom  Child  And now we are all sav'd again by this New Saviour's Satisfaction a'n't we Father  Fath  No Child not all we cannot say all are Saved but all those who are Saved are so Saved  viz  by the Satisfaction of the Blessed Redeemer being chosen from Eternity by the meer Grace and  Goodwill of God to whom after they come into the World God  of the same Grace  gives Repentance and Faith sanctifies and justifies them and then accepts them for the sake of the Saviour of the World  Child  So there is none Saved but such as God has chosen again out of the rest  Fath  We have no Warrant to say any other are Saved and yet we dare not say who shall not be Saved  Child  But who are they then that are chosen Father don't you know their Names  Fath  No Child God has left that uncertain to us  Child  But dear Father I would fain know if my Name be among them for what will become of me if I  should not  be one of them  Fath  I hope thou art Child God has not let us know who are shut out but by their shutting out themselves  Child  But is there no way to know Father  Fath  Why Child it may be presumptively known by this That since to all that God has thus chosen he by his Spirit gives Faith and Repentance Sanctification in Heart and Justification of Person Whoever the Spirit of God worketh this Faith and Repentance in have a very good Assurance that they are in the Number  the Spirit witnessing with their Spirit that they are the Sons of God  Rom  Child  But how shall I know if I have  Faith  and  Repentance  what are they Father I never heard of them in my Life you never told me a word of them before  Fath  REPENTANCE  Child is a sence of and sincere sorrow for Sin in all its Parts as well Original as Actual and this Sorrow must be always attended with a sincere Desire of  Pardon and Sanctification and earnest Endeavours after Reformation and Amendment And  FAITH  Child is a fidutial fillial Confidence in the Promises of God and consequently in God himself thereby humbly realizing and appropriating to our selves the whole Purchase of the Death of  Jesus Christ  with a relying upon his Merits resting on him and adhering to him for Life and Salvation  Child  I shall never remember all this Father how did you come to remember it Did  your Father  only tell it you as you do me are there no Books that teach it me  If not  won't you write it down for me Father You know I can read  Fath  It is all written down already Child and you have it every Word in your Bible  Child  I do remember something Father of  Adam  and  Eve  there Were they the Folks that sinned first Father  Fath  Yes Child and ha'n't you read of  Jesus Christ  Child  Yes Father but I do not understand a Word of him no body ever taught me besides I have heard my Brother cry  O Jesus  and  O Christ  at his Play and Nurse chid him for it and said it was a naughty Word  Fath  Your Brother is a naughty Boy and should be whipt when he uses those Words  Child  Who should whip him Father You don't  Fath  But  I shall  if I hear him say so again  Child  But why Father if  Jesus Christ  be God how is it a naughty Word  Fath  It is a naughty prophane thing to name his Name on slight Occasions that Name should only be named with Fear and Reverence and on a serious Occasion as we use it now  my Dear  your Commandments say you must not take the  Lord's Name  in vain  that is upon common Occasions such as Passion Play Imprecation Prophane Cursing Swearing and the like  Child  But who is this  Jesus Christ  Father I have never heard any thing of him before but only his Name  Fath  He is  GOD manifested in the Flesh  and the  Son of God  sent down from Heaven  to die for Sinners  and to save us from  Eternal Death  Here the Child is silent and Tears fall from its Eyes  Fath  Don't cry  my Dear  why dost cry  Child  I must cry dear Father there is something bids me cry I cannot tell what you say at all Father  but my Heart beats  I am frighted die for Sinners Jesus Christ God God and yet die and die for Sinners what is all this Am I a Sinner  Fath  Yes  my Dear  all of us are Sinners  Child  What and did  GOD  die for me Jesus Christ  DIE for me  The Child trembles and cries the Father weeps too and kisses it moved to see the  Spirit of God  visibly working in the Heart of the little Creature  Fath  Yes my Dear and will Save thee  I hope  for he is thy Redeemer  Child  Then God is not angry with me for my Fault in not knowing him sooner  Fath  No my Dear he is reconcil'd by Jesus Christ who  died to bring thee to God  to make Peace for thee  by the Blood of his Cross  and procure Pardon for all thy Faults  Child  How does he do it  Fath  He gives Repentance and Remission Have you not read in your Bible of Repentance my Dear  Child  I don't know  I believe I have  but no body told me any thing what it is  and I do not remember  Father  Is all that in my Book too  Fath  Yes  my dear  I will shew it thee there and explain it to thee thou shalt not want teaching any longer if thou wilt but learn  Child  Indeed I'll learn it Father with all my Heart shall I know what God is and what Jesus Christ is if I learn my Book Father  Fath  Yes Child all that I have told thee and a great deal more is there my Dear and you must read the Bible and there you will learn it all  Child  Did you learn it all there Father  Fath  Yes my Dear  Child  But did your Father never show you where to find it and tell you what it meant For I have read a deal in that Book Father but I never knew what it meant and  you never shew'd it me  Father You know it was not my Fault dear Father was it You know I am but a Child  Fath  That's true Child you will understand it better when you are a Man  Child  But Father Could not I understand it now if I were shew'd I begin to understand a great deal of what you say That I am born with a Wicked Heart and that if I do not repent and believe in Christ  GOD  who is angry with all Sinners will Judge me at last and punish me Everlastingly and Father I understand now  by what you said before  that God has been very good to me and has made me a better Creature than the Horses and the Cows and given me a Soul Father and all this makes me love him and you say it is lawful for me to  love him  and I am sorry I have not loved him before and afraid he should be angry with me that I have not thanked him before for what he did for me and would ask him Forgiveness  if I knew how  Now Father you say this Faith and Repentance is to be learnt out of this Book but should I not have somebody to  teach me  the Meaning of it And may I not be taught the Meaning of it  Father  though I be not a Man What if I should die and  never be a Man  what will become of me then Father Dear Father won't you teach me the Meaning of this Book before I am a Man  Fath  Yes Child I will teach it thee now as far as I can but you must read your Bible too  my dear  Child  What is this Book Father that I call my Bible  who made it  Fath  It is the Word of  God  written by himself  Child  What did God print it for us himself Father  Fath  No Child God did not print it or write it on the Paper that is not the Case it was first written by Holy Men of God but it was dictated to them by the immediate Inspiration of the Holy Ghost  Child  The  Holy Ghost  Father  What is that  Fath  Why that is God  Child  Dear Father you said first there was but  one God  then you said  Jesus Christ  was  GOD  now you say the  Holy Ghost  is  God  are there three  Gods  I remember my Commandment says  Thou shalt have none other Gods but me  Fath  No Child there are not  three Gods  GOD is but one infinite and undivided Being but the  Godhead  is received and understood by us in Three Persons the  Father  the  Son  and the  Spirit  and these Three are  one God  the Maker and Judge of all  Child  I wonder  Fath  What do you wonder at Child  Child  When you speak of GOD I can do nothing but wonder I cannot think of GOD He is a great something from whom I am and for whom I am and to whom I am but I can't tell what God is  I wonder  Fath  He is incomprehensible Child  you cannot by searching find out  God But in this Book  the Bible  you may learn enough to save you and bring you to him  Child  May I Father  Then I'll get it all without Book  Fath  It is not so much the getting the Words by Heart  Child  as getting  the Word of Life  wrought in your Heart  Child  How is that Father  Fath  Why  Child  to have the Spirit of God which wrote that Word print it in your Mind and give you Understanding both to read and obey it  Child  And will he do that for me Father then I shall not want you to teach me But how if he won't teach me Father  Fath  You must pray to God to open your Understanding and give you the teaching of his Spirit for he has promis'd in his Word  that he will give his Spirit to those that ask it  Child  Has he promis'd that then I'll read the Bible every Day shan't I  Father  Fath  Yes Child  by all means  Child  And every time I open the Book should I not pray for the Teaching of his Spirit to instruct me  Fath  Yes  Child  and to guide and keep you in his Way  Child  Why can the Spirit do that too  Father  Fath  Do that Child  the Spirit of God is  GOD and therefore can do all things but it's the peculiar Work of the Spirit in this Case the Spirit is your Sanctifier it is the Light of your Paths it works Faith and gives Repentance it puts every good thing into you and works every good Work for you it gives a saving Efficacy to every Ordinance it brings you to Christ to rely on him for  Salvation and he brings you to  God the Father  whose Acceptance  in Christ  is your Life  Child  And will this Spirit be had by praying to God  for it  Fath  Yes Child  for you cannot pray to God in Faith without the help of the Spirit and when the Spirit works in you a Disposition to pray it cannot but answer its own Image and the Breathings of the Soul which its self has created for  the longing Soul shall be satisfied  Child  But  Father  you say the Spirit of God has given the Word which you say is the Bible for my teaching and yet you say the Spirit teaches what do they both teach the same thing  Fath  Child  the Bible is your Rule of Life Tho' the Spirit is the secret Instructor the Scripture is the Key of Instruction there you are to learn how  God  is to be worshipped how to order your Conversation aright how to perform your Duty and  what it is the Lord thy God requires of thee  There you have an Historical Account of the whole World of its Creation the Fall the first Condemnation of it to a general Deluge typical of the great Deluge of God's Wrath which shall drown all ungodly Men for ever There you have the History of God's Church from the Beginning to the Fullness of Time and the fullfilling OldTestament Types and Old Testament Promises there you have the History of our Saviour of his miraculous Conception and Birth holy Life wondrous Doctrine stupendious Miracles his Death Passion Resurrection and Glorious Ascension There you have an Account of the first Mission of the  Holy Ghost  and at last the whole Doctrine of the Gospel of Truth founded upon the Redemption purchased by Christ There you have the whole Mystery of Godliness unfolded the great  Wonder of Wonders  the Immortal to die and the Eternal to begin the great Destruction of Sin the Condemnation of the Devil and the Salvation of the World  All this  is to be seen in the Bible which being  the Word of God  you are to read it with Reverence regard it with Faith as the Word of God and obey it as your Rule  Child  And to pray for the Spirit to help me to do so  must I not Father  For you told me I could not believe or understand it without the Spirit to assist me  Fath  That is true  Child  Child  But  Father  are you sure that the Bible is the Word of God  Fath  Yes Child very sure of it  Child  And that the Spirit of God can only teach us to understand it  Fath  Yes Child  Child  Why don't the Minister understand it and teach Folks to understand it what do they go to Church for  Fath  The Ministers are call'd  Ministers of the Word  that is Expounders of the Scriptures and the Preaching of the Gospel is one of the ordinary Means as the reading the Word is another by which the Blessed  Spirit of God  instructs the Hearts of his People and turns them to himself reading the Word written  that is the Bible  and hearing the Word preached that is the Sermons Preached by God's Ministers are the  common  Methods appointed by which the Knowledge of God is conveyed to us  Child  Then I must go to Church and hear the Minister preach as well as read the Bible  Fath  Yes  Child  Child  Why  Father  my Mother has carried me to Church a great many times but I thought I was carried there only to show my new Coat and my  fine Hat  I don't know what the Man said when I went  Fath  But you were a naughty Boy then you should have minded what he said you were not carried there to shew your fine Cloaths  Child  Why  Father  I thought so for when it Rain'd and I could not wear my best Cloaths my Mother would not let me go out or when the Wind blow'd the Powder out of my Hair my Mother would not let me go and I heard you say Father  last Sunday  that you could not go to Church  because  the Barber had not brought your new Perriwig home and  another Sunday  for want of a pair of Gloves you staid at Home and play'd with me all  Sunday  long or lay down on the Couch to sleep I thought Father I had gone thither for nothing but  to shew my fine Cloaths  Fath  No Child  there is other Work to be done there  Child  What  Father to remember what fine Cloaths other Folks have on  is not that it  I know my Sisters go to Church and they do nothing but look about them to see how every body is dress'd and when they come home my Mother and they  you know Father  take up the whole Night in telling one another what every body had on and they do it so well I wondred  Father  and I thought I'd try if I could do so too but I could not remember half of it  Fath  They might have been better employ'd my Dear  Child  What my Mother Indeed Father I thought it had been all they went for and I could not think any thing else you know  when my Mother  did so too  I am sure my Mother would not have done so if it had not been good  for 'tis my dear Mother  and I love her dearly and I am sure she would not do a naughty thing  O see here the Mischief of evil Examples in Parents  Fath  Well Child  thou wilt know better in time the Business of going to Church  is quite of another Nature  it is to hear the Word of God expounded and preach'd and it is  Hearing for thy Life  It is a Duty in the Ministers to Preach they were first sent by our Saviour himself who appointed Apostles and Prophets for the Work of the Ministry and gave them their Errand in his Command  Gapreach the Gospel to every Creature  and it is a Duty  in us  to hear and to hear diligently and not toforsake assembling our selves together  Child  Why  Father  you seldom go your self it is only for little Boys to learn then  is it  Fath  No Child  it is every one's Duty to hear the Word preach'd and to mix it with Faith in the hearing  Child  Then you will let me go to Church  won't you Father  For sometimes my Mother won't let me go to Church if it be but a little ill Weather and if a little Wind does but blow and if God requires me to go and my Mother won't let me  what must I do  Won't God be angry with me for not going to hear his Word preach'd  Fath  If your Mother won't let you go  then Child  it is none of your Fault  Child  But will not God be angry with my Mother  dear Father  for not letting me go  that is all one  Fath  Well Child  be not troubled at that thou shalt go to Church every Day and not be hinder'd  Come  my dear  thou wilt catch cold to be so long out let us go in to your Mother  THE Father as may be well imagined warm'd with the various Thoughts that occurr'd to him upon this surprizing Discourse was willing to get the Child away that he might give Vent to his own Mind and bringing the Child in  walks out  again till he was gotten to a Retirement and then breaks out in a most passionate manner upon himself giving full Vent to his Convictions in such a Manner as this  "What an ungrateful Creature have I been to the Goodness and Bounty of God That Goodness and Bounty which has given me so much Advantage and so many Ways to glorifie him and honour him in the World and to whom I owe my Life my Being and  Well being  in the World And how has God reproved me in this little dear Creature  "  Wretch that I am  how have I liv'd  as without God in the World  and in my Family that I have not so much as told my Children  who made them  or let them know or guess by my Behaviour that there is such a thing  as a God  in the World or that any Worship is due to a Soveraign Almighty Being How has this little Lamb complain'd to me that  he has never heard me pray to God in all his Life  and it is but too true How did it reproach me when I spoke to it of  Jesus Christ  To hear the little Creature say  Who is that Father  And of the  Holy Ghost Who is that Father  And of serving God  Do you serve him Father  "What a Life have I led Good Lord what have I been doing How shall I account to thee for the Souls committed to my Charge That I should have the Blessing of Children given  to me  and my Children have the Curse of a Prayerless uninstructing Father  to them  Tears followed the Parent's Speech and he prays earnestly to God to forgive him the Neglect and Omission of his Duty to his Children and Family and enters into a secret Engagement between  God  and  his own Soul  that for the future he will set up the due and daily Worship of God in his Family and will diligently and carefully instruct his Children teaching them the Knowledge of God and how to serve him and walk in his Ways  After some Composure of Mind upon this Resolution a new Trouble breaks in upon him he had  elder Children  than this and he had liv'd in a continual Neglect of his Duty either in teaching them the Knowledge of God or shewing them a Religious Example These Children had contracted a prophane Habit both in Words Manners and constant Practice had little Inclination to Religion less Knowledge and  no Thoughts at all  about their Souls and began to be  too Old  and  too Big  to be wrought upon by Instruction or Perswasion much less by Violence and Correction  When this Reflection came upon the Parent's Thoughts after the Convictions he had met with from the little Enquirer aforesaid this brought a second Flood of Tears from him and he breaks out  thus  "Lord what will become of my poor wretched Family my other Children my uninstructed unreproved Children What an Instrument have I been in the Ruin of their Souls How does it all lie upon me as a Weight never to be  remov'd they are grown up yet they know nothing of God but to take his Name in vain They neither call upon him nor have I taught them to do so If this poor Lamb reproaches me with having never pray'd with it or for it  and too true it is God knows  What may these say to me that have let them go on thus far in a loose prophane ignorant irreligious Life and have neither reprov'd or instructed them either by Word or Example pray'd with them or taught them to pray for themselves Merciful God why have I not been removed and in Mercy to them as well as in Judgment to my self been snatch'd from them that some other Person might have been set over them more for the good of their Souls  Upon these Convictions  the Man prays earnestly  to the Lord to pardon the heinous Offence of his neglecting his Duty to his Children that God would supply by the teaching of his Blessed Spirit that great want of FamilyInstruction in his Children which he has been the Cause of that he would work Convictions upon them and would continue to stir him up to his Duty in the future directing teaching and governing his Family  But what a hard Task he has with his other Children and how difficult a Work it is to bring Children to a Sense of God and Religion after their green and tender Years are past in which they are moulded  like Wax to a Seal  to receive such first Impressions as the Perswasion and Example of Parents are apt to make  will be apparent in the following Dialogues  End of the First Dialogue  Notes  on the First Dialogue  THE observing Reader will see here that the Author to observe a just Equality between all Opinions and in order to make this work generally useful and acceptable to all Denominations of Christians and to all among them who seriously apply themselves to the great Business of their Eternal Salvation has kept himself in the Answers to this little Child's Enquiry to the plain general Principles of the Christian Religion wherein he has neither prescribed himself in Method or in Words to the Catechisms of either the Church of  England  the Assembly's Catechism or any other but laid down the Principles of Religion consonant to them all as plainly as he could as they are deduc'd from the Holy Scriptures and as they agree with the several Confessions of Faith and Doctrinal Articles as well of the Church of  England  as of all the Protestant Churches and Congregations in  Europe  who profess the same Faith believe the same God and hope for Eternal Life thro' Faith in the same ever Blessed Intercessor and Redeemer  If any particular Christian's Opinion may carry them further or not so far as the Author has express'd himself here in the Doctrines of Original Sin Election of Grace Repentance and Faith in Christ he prays that while they can allow what is laid down here to be Orthodox in the Substance they will extend the same Charity to his Design as he does to their Opinion  viz  To leave room for further Explanations to judge the best and to consider that as this Part is spoken to a Child and is for Children to read for their Instruction it requires to be plain and concise and  so be it  that it be essentially right the more adapted it is to the meanest Understandings the better it answers the Design of this Undertaking  Some may think the Child here is brought in too often falling upon the Father with a Charge of not instructing him and not praying with him and not telling him these things sooner but to such it may be sufficient to say that as this is one of the great Designs of this Work and is not spoken so directly to in any other Part it requir'd to be more than ordinarily pointed out here especially because that upon these iittle Reprehensions of this infant are grounded the several most considerable Parts of the Dialogues which follow in the first Part As particularly the Convictions wrought by it upon the Father mention'd at the end of the Dialogue where he is brought in retiring himself to give Vent to his Soul in reflecting on the breach of his Duty and in Prayer to God also the concurring Convictions wrought by the same Method and by the same Instrument upon the Mother as in the second Dialogue and more especially the Resolution of both to reform themselves and to do their Duties more effectually in their Families  These appearing as is observ'd to be the main Design of this first Part and indeed something of this running thro' the whole Course of the Work it could not but be needful to let those little sharp Reproofs innocently express'd by the little Child in the first Dialogue be often repreated especially where the Sense brought them in with a kind of natural unconstrain'd Innocence in the Expression as is generally carefully ordered whereever those Reproofs are to be met with Nor indeed could the Expressions of the Parents either in their private Ejaculations or mutual conversing upon that Part one with another have been consonant to the  rest of the Work or the cadence of things preserv'd if this had not been laid as a Foundation  These Notes are not design'd to talk over again the whole Subject of every Discourse if the Parts deserve any Comment every considering Christian will make it to themselves as they go but where the Case is particular a Word may be said which in the Dialogues would have been digresling too long and have made it tedious  From the Enquiries of the Child may be observ'd how naturally the Connexion of GospelTruths one with another appears I mean those essential to our Salvation How bright a Chain and how closely hanging one upon another in a Climax that cannot but be admirable to observe is the great Mystery of Man's Fall and Recovery Sin entring into the World Death by Sin Nature corrupted by the Fall sanctified by redeeming Grace  by the Offence of one Man many made Sinners by the Obedience of one many made Righteous  Justice offended by Sin eternal Death denounc'd as the Punishment Justice satisfied by a Redeemer Eternal Life the Consequence  No Condemnation to them who are in Christ  These things lie so plain so natural and in so exact an Order that Nature seems to direct the Child who knows nothing of them to force them from the Father by the Power of the most Innocent uninstructed Enquiries  How unaccountably to blame are those Parents who let their Children know nothing of these things till their own little innocent Enquiries extort it from them  How naturally does the Discourse of this little Child reprove Parents for their Neglect of the Sabbath Day's Work  viz  of attending the publick Worship of God and how could the Child but suppose that going to Church was only a light Matter  since his Father very seldom went himself and stay'd at home upon the most frivolous Occasions  The Child's Discourse about going to Church only to shew his fine Cloaths and his Mother and Sister's being chiefly employ'd there to observe the Fashions and Dresses of their Neighbours with the Conversation they have of those things after they come home needs no Enlargements here the Consciences of most young People in our own Families will teach them to apply that Part to themselves and the Author is content to leave it out if it is not generally acknowledg'd to be a needful Reproof The Child is brought in here several times saying to his Father when he speaks of serving loving and praying to God  Do you do so Father  This puts me in mind of a Story not improper to be related A wicked Boy that had been addicted to Swearing and ill words was reproved by his Father with more Seriousness than usual and his Father toid him that God heard him The Father it seems was a Man of no Religion or atleast of very ill Morals himself but what he happen'd to say to the Boy struck him so deeply that it was a means of Conviction to the Child but Ignorance having been the Boy's greatest Unhappiness when he came to consider of what his Father had said he asks one of the Family whether God could see as well as hear when he was answer'd yes That God was Infinite and could hear and see all things He told them he could not believe it  for my Father was drunk last Night  says he  sure he would not have been Drunk if God could see him  else  why did he tell me I should not Swear because God could hear me  If Parents knew or at least consider'd the Influence their evil Examples have upon their Children and how fatal an Encouragement to  Sin it is to any Children to be able to say  My Father does so himself  the Presence of their Children would be a greater Restraint to Conscientious Parents  even in Things in themselves indifferent much more in Things really sinful  than it is possible the Presence and Awe of the Parent can be to the Children It is enough that Religious Parents have to struggle with in the perverse and wicked Inclinations of their Children but they will find those Liberties their Children take from the Encouragement of their Parents Example will be ten times more difficult to restrain  afterwards  than those they have from their own Inclination or the Example of others It ennervates all the Exhortations of a Father takes the Edge off from their Reprehension makes their Resentment seem unjust and unreasonable and makes the Child rather apt to retort the Practice of the Parent upon themselves than receive patiently and meekly the Admonition  I humbly recommend this Thought to those Parents who indulge themselves in any Vanities or Excesses such as in Passion in hasty Expressions in Expences in waste of Time in ill Words in Gaming nay or any of those things  which the World are apt to call Lawful and Innocent  If such things  must  be indulg'd and  you will  allow your selves in them upon a Presumption that  you  can do them innocently at least then conceal them from your Children lest what you can use with Moderation they fall into with Excess and justify the Practice from your Example  It will be a very uncomfortable Reflection and will fill the Mind with bitter Reproaches if ever God pleases to try such Parents when they shall see the Introduction to their Children's Ruin formed and begun in their  the Parents  Example  nor will it be any alleviation to their Sorrow to say I us'd those Diversions moderately and kept my self within Compass it was but very seldom that I us'd an ill Word I play'd at Cards but very moderately and never for much Money I seldom drank hard and the like Our Moderation in Diversions shall introduce our Children's Excess and if the Apostle rather than offend a weak Brother would wholly abstain even from Part of his necessary Sustenance  viz eating of Flesh  how much more should Parents refrain their Excesses nay even their lawful Diversions rather than lay a Foundation of the Ruin of their Children and prompt them to Sin by giving them a Pretence from or Encouragement by their  Father's  Example  From the whole of this Dialogue Parents may see besides their Duty to God what they owe to their Children in timely and early instructing them how much instructing our Children is a Debt to them and how unjust and injurious we are to our Children in omitting to Instruct them What moving Expressions of the Child to the Father are these  Dear Father  says the Child  why would you not tell me of it before  Was you angry with me Father And what if it should be too late now Will not God punish me Everlastingly now because I have not known this sooner How cutting must it be to a Parent that has any Sense of Eternity to think that his dear Children should be lost by his Example or remain blind by his Omission  These and many other Observations might be made here from the Particulars of this first Dialogue but it is hop'd the reading the Dialogue its self will cause many of them to occur and the Brevity of this Work admits not our Notes to be too long  The Second DIALOGUE  THIS Dialogue begins upon the following Occasion The next Day after the former Discourse  with the Father  the Child was carried to Church and the Minister happen'd to be preaching upon the Death of our Saviour his Text was  God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son  c And the Minister giving some Historical Account of the Death and Sufferings of Christ and making some practical Improvements of it in his Discourse the Child when he came home was found crying in a Room by its self and the Mother being call'd begins the Dialogue thus  Moth  CHild  What dost cry for  After some Difficulty  the Child answers  the Minister made him cry  Moth  How so why what did he say  Child  He said that  God was dead  Moth  Child  he did not say any such thing you have forgot what he said  Child  No I han't Mother  I am sure he said  Jesus Christ  was dead and my Father told me yesterday that  Jesus Christ  was  GOD  Moth  But Child  Jesus Christ  is risen again  Child  I know that he said so too but he was dead first and the wicked  Jews  kill'd him sure they were sad Folks Mother why did they kill him  Moth  You will read it in your Bible my Dear  Child  But Mother  the Minister says he died for us and my Father said he died for me did the  Jews  kill him for me  Mother  Moth  He died for thee  my Dear  and me and every body else that believes in him  Child  Why did he die for me  Mother  I don't know what you mean tell me  dear Mother  did I make him die  Moth  My dear  he died to save his People from their Sins and I hope thou art one of them  Child  Why Mother  have I any Sins  What are they Mother  Moth  We are all Sinners  Child  Sin is offending God in Thought Word and Deed at which he is angry  Child  When I do a Fault is God angry for that  Is that Sin  Mother  Moth  Every Fault you do  my Dear  is not a Sin against God  Child  When did I make God angry then  Moth  When you break any of God's Commandments  then  you sin against  GOD  as when you take God's Name in vain when you disobey your Father and Mother  and the like  these are Sins against God and these he is angry at  Child  I never take God's Name in vain  Mother  nor never disobey you Mother I love you dearly and do every thing you bid me don't I dear Mother  Moth  Well  my dear  and I hope God is not angry with thee be a good Boy then I am not angry with thee my Dear  Hither the  Mother speaks coldly and makes slight of the thing and having no other View at first than only quieting the Child was for going away at which the Child cries again  Moth  Why dost cry  my Dear  I tell thee I am not angry with thee do not cry  Child  God may be angry with me for all that  Mother  Moth  No no  God is not angry with thee do not cry my Dear  Still the Mother is insensible of the Work of God in the Heart of the Child and takes all this for common Talk but she soon sees with other Eyes  Child  Why Mother will God never be angry with me but when you are angry I am afraid God is angry with me tho' you kiss me and be Friends with me and love me  Moth  Why  so my Dear  Child  Why  dear Mother  my Father told me Yesterday that God has done a great many things  for me  and given me a great many  good things  and I never thank'd him nor lov'd him for it  yet  nor serv'd him nor pray'd to him  yet  and is not God angry with me then  The Child weeps  Moth  That is very true  my Dear  but I hope God is not angry do not cry  my Dear  Child  But should not I have thank'd God for all that Is it not a Fault  Mother  Moth  Yes  my Dear  you should have thank'd him pray'd to him and praised him  Child  But how should I have done it Mother I did not know and  The Mother was but cold and indifferent all this time  but now  she found herself TOƲCH'D and was confounded with the Child's Discourse and taking the Child in her Arms she kiss'd it and wept but could not speak to it a great while at last she said with great Tenderness  you never told me  and my Father never told me nor show'd me how will God be angry that I did not thank him when  I could not tell how to do it  Moth  My dear Child  It is not thy Fault it is our Fault it is my Fault and it is thy Father's Fault we have not shown thee nor taught thee nor given any good Example to thee how thou should'st thank God or serve or know God  Child  Yes my Father did it last Night  Moth  Alas poor Child  thy Father and I too should have done it many Nights and Years ago more Shame for us that we have neglected it till thou should'st reprove us for it thy self  Child  But my Father said it was not too late now  Mother  Moth  I pray God it be not  but that's no thanks to us  my Dear  thou may'st have Cause to blame us  Here the Mother finds the Heart of the Child is touch'd  and  it immediately enter'd into her Thoughts that she might be made a Temptation to the Child to despair and cast off Conviction this allarms the Mother on the other Hand  and therefore she adds  to thy dying Day  Child  But is it  too late  for me then  Mother  Moth  No  my Dear  God forbid  the Sin has been ours not thine but it is  never  too late to pray to God  Child  What must I do when I pray to  God  Moth  You must confess your Sins to him pray to him to forgive your Sins to bless you and sanctifie you and preserve you you must pray to him to give you your daily Bread and keep you from  all Evil you must give Thanks to him for all his Mercies and all the good things he has done for you  Child  Must I thank God when I pray  Mother  How can I do so Is that praying  Moth  Yes  my dear  praising God for Mercies receiv'd is part of the Duty of Prayer as well as seeking to him for Mercies we want for so God has commanded  in every thing by Prayer and Supplication WITH THANKSGIVING making our Requests known unto God  Child  But if I have made God angry  how can I ask him Forgiveness  Will God forgive me  Moth  Yes  my dear  he will forgive thee he is a Merciful God  it is his Nature and Property ever to have Mercy and to forgive  Child  How do you know it  Are you sure  Mother  that God will  forgive me my Fault if I ask him Forgiveness  Moth  He has promised to do so  my dear  Child  How Mother  I never heard him speak Did he tell you so  Mother  Moth  My dear  he has promised in his Word it is in your Bible which is the Word of God  Child  O I am glad if it is there  my Father told me  that God speaks to me and I hear him speak when I read my Book show it me there Mother  Moth  There it is  my Dear  Here the Mother shows the Child the several Texts following  Whoso confesses and forsakes shall find Mercy if we confess and forsake our Sins he is just and faithful to forgive us our Sins The Blood of Christ cleanseth from all Iniquity  Child  The Blood of Christ  Mother  what is that  Interrupting her  Moth  Why my Dear this is that the Minister made thee cry about  Jesus Christ  is that great Saviour which the Minister told thee shed his Blood for our Sins Died and was Crucified to save a Lost World  Child  But  dear Mother  my Father told me Christ was God  can God die  Moth  My Child  Christ  was God Eternal one with the Father but Christ to fullfil the great Purpose of Man's Redemption according to the Eternal Council of God before the World began in the fullness of Time  became Man  took upon him  not the Nature of Angels but of the Seed of  Abraham and this he did that he might be  GodMan  and therefore be a Mediator between God and Man partaking of the Nature of both and laying his Hand upon both  to make Peace for us thro' the Blood of his Cross  Child  I cannot understand this it is all wonderful A wonderful Mystery  Moth  It is so my Dear This is the great Mystery of Godliness God manifest in the Flesh  Child  And did this  GodMan  die  FOR ME  Mother  how is that  Moth  He died for the Sins of all that believe on him  Child  But what is it you mean by dying for Sin and dying for me  Mother  I do not understand it  Moth  Sin my dear  is offending God or making God angry and this Sin or this Anger of God would end in Death  for the Wages of Sin is Death  But God in his own Original Love to us sent his Son to die in our stead that whosoever Beleiveth in him might not perish but have Everlasting Life  Child  And so  if I sin  I must die Mother  Moth  Yes  my dear  Child  And must you die  if you sin  Mother  Moth  Yes  my dear  Child  But you never sinn'd  I hope then  Moth  Alas my Dear  I am a great Sinner  Child  Why you must not die  Mother  you shall not die  Mother  shall you  The Child weeps  Moth  We must all die  my dear  but this is meant of Eternal Death  going to Hell  Child dying  for ever  This is that which is  the Wages of Sin  Child  Must all that Sin go to Hell Mother  Moth  No  my dear  this is what I was saying before that God being  thus angry  with Sinners and the Wages of their Sin  being Death  this Blessed Son of God this  GodMan  the Mediator came into the World and taking on him our Nature died  FOR ƲS  there 'tis  my dear  in your Bible  Romans    That while we were yet without Strength in due time Christ died for the Ʋngodly  And there again  Tim    This is a faithful Saying and worthy of all Acceptation that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners  And in abundance of other Places  Child  Let me see it  Mother  for my Father said  God spoke  in my Bible and I shall be sure it is true if it be there  Moth  I'll turn the Leaf down at it  my dear  that you may find it again  The Child reads again  died for the Ʋngodly  And looking up to its Mother asks this very affectionate Question  Child  Dear Mother  Did Jesus Christ die for me what for me I did not know him I have done nothing to make him die nor I have done nothing to please him I never loved him how should he love me and love me so as to die for me why for me  Mother  Moth  This  my dear  is the great thing for which we should praise and love and adore God and Jesus Christ that all this should be done  FOR ƲS  before we had either done Good or Evil as thou hast said  my dear  thou hast done nothing to please him nor hast loved him it is all his own Love to us not our Love to him  Child  Why would God love me whether I loved him or no  Mother  Moth  Yes  my dear  see in your Bible  John    For God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have Everlasting Life  And again Joh  Herein is Love not that we loved God but he loved us and sent his Son to be a Propitiation for our Sins  Child  But may not I love God  now  for all this Love to me  Mother  Moth  Yes  my dear  his Love to us moves us to love him John  We love him because he first loved us  Child  Indeed  I will love God  sure I must love him if he will not be angry tho' I sin against him  Don't you love him  Mother  Moth  I desire to love and fear and serve him as long as I live  my dear  Child  And may I not do so too  Mother  Moth  Yes  my dear  Child  And did you do so before  Mother  Moth  I hope I did  my dear  Child  But I have not done it before  Mother  Was not that a Fault in me  Mother  And is not God angry at that  Moth  Well Child  but you have heard that  Jesus Christ  died to turn away God's Anger for that and all other Sins  Child  Indeed  dear Mother  I did not know I must love God and fear God  before  I never heard any thing of it in my Life  Here the Mother is stung again and reproaches herself with having neglected the Instruction of her Child and weeping says to the Child  Moth  My Dear  That is my Sin and thy Father's Sin and not thine we ought to have taught thee  long ago  and we have reason to mourn for it and repent of it as long as we live  Child  But may I not love God now  Mother  Moth  You must love God and love Jesus Christ and serve and fear him this is one End of your Creation  Child  How can I love Jesus Christ now  Mother  you say he is dead can I love him now he is dead  Moth  He is risen again Child from the Dead  Child  Risen again  Mother  How is that  Moth  My Dear  as I told thee before  it was necessary for him to be Man  as well as God  that he might in our Nature satisfie Divine Justice so likewise it was necessary he that was to be a Mediator should be  GOD as well as Man  that he might justifie us before God and interceed with God for us for ever  Child  How is this  I wonder at it  but do not understand it how is it  Mother  dead and alive again and risen and intercede What is it all I do not understand it  Moth  As Man he could die  Child  but as God he could not remain dead  Child  Is this in my Bible too  Mother does God say this there too  Moth  Yes  my dear  look here  Acts    Whom God hath raised up having loosed the Pains of Death because it was not possible he could be holden of it  Child  But is he risen again for me too  Moth  Yes  my Dear  he has both died for thee and is risen again for thee too  Child  Show me that in my Book  Mother  Moth  Here it is Child  Rom    Who was delivered for our Offences and is risen again for  Here the Child in a little Extasie of Soul  mov'd by the blessed Spirit of God  grasps the Book and kisses the Leaf eagerly clapping it to its Breast at which the Mother surpriz'd says  our Justification  Moth  Why dost thou do that  my Dear  Child  I love him  dear Mother  I love him  Moth  Dost thou know  why  thou lovest him  my Dear  Child  I love  GOD Dear Mother  that has loved me so much before I knew him and I love  Jesus Christ  because he has died  for me  and is risen again  for me  may not I love him  Dear Mother  For tho' I love him I am afraid for my Father told me  he is a dreadful God  Moth  It is true  he is a consuming Fire to  Sin and the Workers of it but to those who love and fear him  he is a Faithful Creator and a merciful Redeemer  Child  Then I may love him for that  Moth  May  my Dear  you not only  may  but must  Matt    Jesus said unto him thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart and with all thy Soul and with all thy Mind This is the first and great Commandment  Child  Will he not be angry  Mother  if I don't love him  Moth  Yes  my Dear  for he has commanded you to love him  John    Continue ye in my Love  And  G    He saith  The Fruit of the Spirit is  Love  And he has promised a blessed Return to those that love him  John    He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father and I will love him and will manifest my self unto him  Child  I wish I could love him more  Dear Mother  Moth  You will  my Dear  as you grow up  Child  How  Mother  Moth  Why the longer you live the more you will know him and the Knowledge of God and the Experience of his Goodness will increase your Love  Child  How shall I know him more  Moth  I hope he will fill thy Heart with Knowledge according to the Promise of the Covenant of Grace  Child  What is that  Mother  Moth  It is the blessed Declaration of God  in his Word  wherein he has engag'd himself and his Faithfulness to his believing People both to be their God and to preserve them in his Fear  Child  And has he promis'd me that I shall know him  Mother  Moth  Yes  my Dear  Child  Is that in my Book too  Mother  Moth  Yes  my Dear  here it is  Jer    And they shall teach no more every man his Neighbour and every man his Brother saying Know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord For I will forgive their Iniquity and remember their Sin no more  Child  And what shall I do when I know him  Moth  Knowing him you will believe on him and believing you will have Life thro' his Name  John    Child  When shall I do this  Mother  Moth  As thou growest up  my Dear  Here some Family Occasions calling off the Mother the Second Dialogue ends  Notes on the Second Dialogue  FIrst observe of the Child's being carried to Church That by the Word Church or going to Church in all these Dialogues is to be understood the Place and  going to  the Place of publick Worship whether in the Church of  England  People to their Parish Churches or in Dissenters to their several MeetingHouses the particular distinguishing it one way or another being studiously avoided here the Subject as the Author humbly conceives being not at all concern'd in our diversity of Opinions Sects or separate Assemblies but equally instructing to all who call themselves Christians and especially Protestant Christians he believes it would be very much Wrong to lay a Stumblingblock at the Threshold and to put any Prejudice in the Minds of the serious Readers which also might prevent by Partiality to Opinions the Benefit which may otherwise be universal to Christians of all Opinions whatsoever and this Latitude in his Charity and in his Design of doing Good to all he hopes none will be offended at  The Father and Mother of this little Child appear here to be no ignorant Persons in the Principles or Duties of Christianity but as to the rest it may be observ'd What a wretched irreligious  Life some of those who have the greatest Share of Knowledge in Matters of Religion do lead especially in their Families What Regret it brings upon their Minds when they are convinc'd of their Wickedness in the Neglect of their Families and when as in this case much of it may be too late to be retriev'd  What bitter Reproaches such Children oftentimes cast back upon their Parents when they  the Children  come to find what they have lost for want of a godly religious Education and early Instruction either good Children or bad  If the Children prove sober and religious without the helps of Instruction  for the Spirit of God is not confin'd or constrain'd to these outward Helps  how are they asham'd of and a Shame to their Parents And how must the Parents blush when they may upon any Occasion be told that the Knowledge the Piety the Fear of God which is found in their Children is no Product of their planting no Fruit of what they had sown Religious Children of prophane or negligent Parents are a double Testimony to powerful invincible Grace but a dreadful Reproach to the Parents  This may be a Thought worthy the Consideration of any Christian Parent that having neglected the Instruction of their Families and neglected teaching and praying with or for their Children what a just Contempt will those Children naturally have for those Parents especially if ever God comes to enlighten their Hearts and open their Eyes  as he sometimes does without the help of Paternal Instruction  when the Children come to reflect how their Parents totally neglected the Salvation of their Souls compar'd to which the Provision made for their Bodies was but of little Value the Disgust at the Omission of the former will be too  apt to take off all the Gratitude and Affection due for the latter  Nothing but meer Duty can be supposed to preserve the Child's Respect and even common Civility to its Parents when he comes to be sensible how unnaturally they abandon'd his Immortal Part how unchristianly they expos'd his better his intellectual Part to Eternal Destruction as if the Duty of a Parent had ended or been restrain'd within the narrow Compass of the Office of a Nurse or a Schoolmaster and that they had no Obligation upon them to regard the eternal Happiness of that Part of their Posterity which can never die  Such Parents are certainly the most unnatural and may justly be reproach'd by their Children not with neglect of their Duty  only  but with their being without Natural Affections and consequently can by no means expect suitable returns of Affection from their Children when they come to be made sensible of the Treatment they have receiv'd from them if they show them common Respect  as above  it must be all owing to that very Grace which in spight of the Obstructions of a Godless Education has been planted in the Heart by the powerful Influence and invincible Operation of the Spirit of God  For Parents to pretend Love to their Children and Natural Affection as they are the Fruit of their Bodies and  as is vulgarly express'd  their own Flesh and Blood and at the same time neglect to instruct them or educate them either in human Learning or religious Knowledge is just as if when their Children are taken sick they should employ themselves in mending or making them Cloaths or dressing up fine Banquets or Entertainments for them and wholly omit the necessary  Cordials or Applications for the Recovery of their Health  only with this difference  that the Soul to the Body has infinitely a greater Disproportion than the Health and the daily Food  But our Case extends yet farther  viz That the Defect complain'd of here is not the want of Education and Instruction from the Ignorance or Incapacity of the Parent for this had been the Hand of God immediately in bringing forth the Child from Parents that knew not God but  the Case here  is yet more aggravated in that  this happens  in Families where the Parents have the Knowledge and have the Capacity and know and acknowledge it to be their Duty to instruct their Children and yet entirely neglect it which adds to the Crime in the Parent and will be ground of Astonishment and Reflection in the Children  if they ever come to the Knowledge of God without the due Assistance  of their Parents Nor will the Reflections of the Parents be less bitter on themselves than those of their Children as will be more lively represented in the other Dialogues of this Part  But this Subject may also be of present Use to Children who have not the Blessing of Godly Parents to instruct them and for this it is also design'd and these as well as those whose Parents neglect the great Duty of instructing them are desir'd to consider from the Example of this little Child these few things  That the most plain most natural and mosteasie questions that it is possible a Child can ask will lead them to know both their Creator and their Duty to him  Such as  Who made me  What was I made for  What am I  What Business have I here  How came I hither  Whither am I going  What is my End  What is Good  What is Evil  The little Babe  here represented  infers by the meer Power of Natural Reasoning  That he was made better than the Brutes  That it was the Goodness of his Maker which distinguish'd him so  That Fear Service Love and Obedience were natural Returns for that Goodness  Thus  the meanest Capacity and the youngest Child may supply the Defect of Education if they think but a little seriously of themselves and the Original of their Being  It is also observable that as soon as ever the Soul is but able to enquire rationally about its self  Nature  and  Reason  concur to lead him to the Knowledge of  a God a First Cause a chief Good  and  an ultimate End OF  whom and  FOR whom  and  TO  whom  are all things  and these Impulses go on till natural Religion join'd with reveal'd Religion discover Christ  and God in Christ reconciling us to Himself not imputing our Trespasses  which is the Sum and Substance of the Christian Religion  This is the great End of  these Dialogues  as they respect Children  viz  That they may  where perhaps FamilyInstruction has been wanting  guide themselves to the Knowledge of God and of their Duty by these familiar Steps which Nature it self will be most certain to concur with As they respect Parents their End is plain  viz  They are a Satyr upon their neglect of Duty and a Reproof to them in Order to Amendment  The Third DIALOGUE  THE Mother of this pretty Infant sensibly affected with the Discourse she had had with him in the last Dialogue and  in teaching her Child  being particularly taught how she had neglected her own Duty appears under a great  and more than ordinary  Concern Her Husband was under  the same Convictions  and each were very desirous to unbosom themselves to one another tho' utterly ignorant of the respective Circumstances This occasions the following Dialogue or Discourse between the Husband and the Wife the rest of the Family being withdrawn the Husband perceiv'd his Wife melancholly and that she had been weeping and  being a very tender loving Husband  begins with her thus  Husband  MY Dear  what is the Matter I believe something troubles thee  Wife  I cannot deny it and if I did you see I cannot conceal it  Wife weeps and is backward to tell the Occasion but her Husband presses her to tell him  Husb  Tell me  my Dear  what afflicts thee if it be in my Power to relieve it you have no reason  to doubt but  as in Duty I ought  so in Affection I am inclin'd to give you all the Comfort all the Advice and all the Assistance I am able  Wife  Alas You cannot assist in my Case no nor any one in the World and the reason why I am backward in telling it is because  when I do  you will perhaps be so far from easing my Grief that you will add to it  by falling into the same your self  for my Affliction equally concerns you and my self  Husb  My Dear  there is no Affliction can befal thee but either I must have an equal Share in it be wanting in Affection to thee  which I never was yet  or want a concern for my own Happiness since ever since we have been One by Consent or by Contract I have but one Interest one Wish and one Desire with you and this not by Duty only but by Inclination  Wife  I have a full Experience of that and thought my Happiness always compleat in it and the more in that I have not been able to charge my self with the least Breach  on my Part  to render that Affection less pleasing  to you  or less satisfying  to me  but we have hoth been wanting in one thing and I fear have nothing to excuse or to accuse one more than another and this is my present Grief  The Husband touch'd before answers with Blushes in his Face  Husb  I know not what you can mean unless it be want of performing some Duties which we owe to God and our Children  Wife  O you have touch'd it  there it lies  and if you had had such a Messenger sent from God  to reprove you for it  as I have had  to Day  I question not but it would have touch'd you as nearly as it does me  Husb  I know not what thou hast had  to day  but I had such a Lecture preach'd to me Yesterday by  a little dear Infant  even our own youngest Child  that has almost broke my very Soul within me and you may know part of it  by this  that you know I slept not a Wink all last Night  Wife  O my Dear  the same is my Instructor he has certainly been sent from God to me  Husb  And to me too  whether it be for a blessed restoring End or for Judgment and the terrible Part of Conviction he only knows  Here they repeat to one another the Circumstances of the former Dialogues with the Child and the Effects which the Surprise of it had upon both their Minds severally  Husb  It is impossible to express to you how the little Creature mov'd me it was a Dagger  struck into my very Heart  to hear the  dear Lamb  ask me Father  will not God be angry with me that I have not thank'd him and lov'd him and pray'd to him before And how should I know it  Father  you never told me  When I told him he must pray to God was it not cutting me to the Heart to hear it say  Do you pray to him Father  And when I told him  Yes  to have him say  I never hear'd you Father  I was not able to bear it I was fain to stop and turn away from him  Wife  I believe we may both say as the Disciples at  Emmaus Did not our Hearts burn within us when he talked to us by the Way  For my Part I am amaz'd when I look upon the Child but  when I look in  and reflect how I have neglected the great Duty of instructing  not this Child only  but all my Children  I am confounded  and not able to hold up my Head How justly may my Children reproach me not only with omitting to teach them to do good but with abominably encouraging them  to Vanity and neglect of God by my Example O I have ruin'd all my Children  Husb  No no  you have not ruin'd them  it is I  have ruin'd them for it was my Duty to have exercis'd the Authority  of a Father  and of a Governour of a House to have set up the Worship of God in my Family to have prayed  with them  and  for them  and instructed them to pray  for themselves  they could not have ask'd me then whether  they might  pray to God or whether  ever  I prayed to God  or no  Wife  And  I have  been a great Cause of your neglecting that Part too for I have slighted it and ridicul'd it in others and thought it meer Ostentation and Form as if none but Persons of higher Quality should have Prayers in their Family and thought it look'd too big for us  Husb  Ay but  my Temptation  has been of another kind I have thought it a Solemnity I was  not fit  for I have question'd my own Performance I have often thought if I was a  Nobleman  I would keep a Chaplain but I was asham'd to pray in the Hearing of my Servants and Children as if that was dishonourable and mean which was my natural Duty or as if I was asham'd to own that which was the Glory of a Christian  viz To worship and call upon him that made him  as if Nature which dictates to the least Child to call and cry to its Father and Mother for Bread  when it is an hungry  did not dictate to me and to every rational Creature to worship that God in whom we live and move and have our Being  Wife  And what Course shall we take now  Husb  There is no Difficulty in resolving what Course to take with this little Infant  he is taught from Heaven  and the Spirit of God is visibly working in him if we do not  instruct him  he  will every Day  instruct us  and  reprove us too  but what shall we do with our other Children who are grown up and have imbib'd a Course of Vanity and Levity without any Restraint There will be our Difficulty  Wife  And who are very likely to be impatient of Restraint and perhaps not so easily to be governed now  for my Part  I do not think I shall ever be able to break my Daughter from her foolish Habit such as playing all Night at Cards going to the Playhouse wearing Patches reading foolish Romances singing idle Songs taking God's Name in vain and an intollerable Looseness of Behaviour which I have too much given her a Liberty in and encourag'd her also from my own Example  Husb  I shall have as hard a Task with my elder Sons that have got a Habit of Company of ill Words and of Idleness it is impossible to reclaim them they are gone too far What shall be done they are lost thro' my Neglect and justly may they lay their ruin at my door both Body and Soul  Wife  My Dear  we are in a sad Condition and mine is worse still for I have not only neglected my Duty to my Children and praying with my Children but my Duty to God too I mean my private Duty for Ineither prayed with them nor for them nor by my self nor for my self  the common going to the publick Worship excepted  which I have pass'd over as slightly and unconcern'd also as if it were only a thing of course  Husb  This touches me too  my Dear  for it was my Duty not only to have prayed with my Children and with my Family but in private  with you  and  for you  and we both ought mutually to have assisted encouraged and exhorted one another  in  and  to  our Duty I ought to have  watch'd over you and mov'd you and perswaded you to your Duty and you me both as to private and FamilyWorship It all lies at my door and at my hand will God require the Souls of those he had put under my Roof  Wife  I have been as guilty  as you  for I have shewn a general Contempt of this Duty I have never encourag'd you to it or shewn you in the least that I desir'd it or would be willing to join in it on the contrary you have always seen me as wild and as vain as if I was not a Mother of a Family but a single Person without any relative Obligations on me  Here both Husband and Wife not able to refrain Tears from the Power of their Conviction the Discourse breaks off for a time till the Husband reviving it goes on  Husb  Well it must be done  however difficult however  seemingly  fruitless and to no purpose  by how much  the greater it has been a Sin in us both to neglect it  by so much  stronger is the Obligation upon us both to undertake it the poor Children are wellnigh undone already it is never too late Who knows but God may bless Instruction tho' begun at an unseasonable time  It may be  we may yet meet with Success in the way of our Duty  if not  we must leave that to God  we must begin  and must go on for as we both know it is our Duty our Children  may be still lost  notwithstanding our Endeavour but we are  sure to be lost  if we willfully neglect it  Wife  Alas what can we do Where can we begin now Which of our Children will mind what we say How will they humble us by throwing our own Example in our way and object our former Practice as an Answer to all our future Instructions  I think verily it is too late now  it will be all to no purpose to go about it it will have no effect at all  Husb  My Dear you say you are sensible it has been a Sin that you have not encourag'd me in it and joyn'd with me in it before it must be therefore still a Sin to continue to do so and a greater Sin than before by  how much  we are convinc'd now that it was our sinful neglect before  Wife  Nay I will not obstruct it God forbid  I only say  I fear the Event will not answer and I am at a loss which way to go about it  Husb  I'll tell you  my Dear  which way we will go about it let us first  join together  sincerely to God in Prayer acknowledging with a deep Humility and hearty Repentance  our great Sin  in neglecting his Worship in our Family as well as in private and our dishonouring him in our Conversation imploring  for the Sake of Jesus Christ our only Mediator and Advocate  Pardon for those our past Sins of  Omission  and  Commission  seeking his Blessing upon our Resolution of Amendment and begging that our Instructing our Family and Children  however late and long omitted  may yet be successful and have a double Effect to the Salvation of the Souls of our Children and to the Glory and Honour of Sovereign Grace  Wife  My Dear however doubting I am of the Success yet  I'll join with you with all my Heart  in that and in every thing else that I can which may serve to reform reclaim and restore our poor Children whose Danger is so plainly occasion'd by our Neglect  Husb  As to my Family  I'll tell you what I purpose to do I desire you to let  your Daughters  know that we are resolved to reform several Practices which we do not like in their Behaviour that their Father dislikes their general Conduct expects they use more Modesty in their Dress and Conversation  will have  them wear no more  Patches go to no more Plays  spend  no more precious time at Cards nor  walk  out in the Park or Fields any more on the  Lord's Day  But on the contrary that they apply themselves to reading the Scriptures and to think of worshipping God after a different manner than they have hitherto done and I shall take care  to do the same  by my Sons  Wife  I will do  all I can  with them tho' I fear their Compliance  Husb  Then  as soon as they come home next Sabbathday from the Sermon I will call them all together and to the best of my Capacity tell them their Duty  in general  both to God themselves and their Parents and that  where as  I have thought they have taken too much Liberty  for the time past  because I have not restrain'd them and show'd them their Duty they shall have no reason for the future to make that Excuse from me but that from this time I resolve to oblige all my Family to serve God both publickly and privately  as much  and  as well  as I can that they may both  incline  to pray to God themselves and  know how  to do it I shall  besides the publick Worship of God which I shall expect they constantly attend  always have proper times set apart for worshipping God  together  in the Family will pray  with them  and  for them  as I am able And having said thus I will begin with reading the Word of God to them and then  as well as I can  will go to Prayer with them my self  Wife  My Dear  I'll be glad of this  with all my Heart  and rejoice at the Thought of it but  O my Soul trembles  for the poor vain Creatures our Children especially our Two Eldest  Son  and  Daughter  I am certain they will but laugh at it and despise it  they are run on too far  we should have begun this when they were young I know it by their Temper and Carriage in other things  Husb  My Dear  it is our Duty to do it  and  it is our Duty to  make them  observe it and tho' they are  too old  to correct yet  I assure you  if I don't find a ready Compliance with it I shall find ways to show my Resentment for we have too long dallied with our Duty already and as God will not be  mocked by us  so we must not  be mocked by our Children  Wife  My Dear  I am most desirous of the thing only my Heart fails me in the Case of Success  Husb  We must do our Duty  if God will bless us in doing it  he will bless the Work too and will cause such an Awe of his  Majesty  to go with the Performance as that they shall not dare to despise it or to shew any Contempt  of us  for it  Wife  The God of Heaven give it such a Blessing if it be his Will I go as willingly about it as you but with many discouraging Thoughts for  the Event  but however I'll do all my Part according to your Direction  End of the Third Dialogue  Notes  on the Third Dialogue  WHat a great deal of Work have those People behindhand who do not begin to instruct and restrain their Children till they are too big for Correction  Folly that is bound up in the Heart of a Child says  Solomon is driven  thence by the Rod of Correction  But when it remains in the Child and neither the  Rod  of Correction or the  Voice  of Instruction is made use of  to drive it out  till the Child grows up to be a Man it is very hard nay impossible  but by a supernatural Assistance  to drive it out at all  What this Folly is  needs no Description here other than an allow'd Custom in doing Evil a natural Propensity we all have to Evil with this we are all born into the World the Soul is originally bent to  Folly  this Bent or Inclination must be rectified  or driven out  either by  Instruction  or if that proves insufficient by  Correction  and it is to be done while the Person is  young  while he is a  Child  and then  IT MAY  be done The Child  may  be wrought upon Nature like some Vegetables is malleable when taken  green  and  early  but hard and brittle when condens'd by Time and Age  at first  it bows and bends to Instruction and Reproof but afterwards obstinately refuses both  The Temper of a Child misled by Vice or Mistake  like a dislocated Bone  is easie to be reduc'd into its Place  if taken in time  but if suffer'd toremain in its dislocated Position a callous Substance fills up  the empty Space  and by neglect grows equally hard with the Bone and resisting the Power of the Surgeon's Skill renders  the Reduction  of the Joynt impossible  The Heart of the tender Youth by forbearance of Instruction grows opinionated and obstinately embraces the Follies he has been indulg'd in not being easily convinc'd of the criminal Quality of what he has been so long allow'd the Practice of  by his negligent Parents  and this renders late Instruction fruitless  THEN as to Correction  the Heart being hardned as before by Opinion and Practice and especially in a Belief that he  ought not to be corrected  the Rod of Correction has a different Effect for as  the Blow  of a Stripe makes an Impression on the Heart of a Child as stamping  a Seal does upon the soft Wax the Reproof even of Words on the same Heart when grown up and made hard is like striking upon Steel which instead of making an Impression  on the Metal  darts back sparks of Fire in your Face  As this whole Work is chiefly design'd to convince Parents of the Necessity of beginning early the great Work of instructing and managing their Children so  two things  will run more visibly thro' every Part of it    For their Encouragement  the Examples of the easiness and advantages of early Instruction will be seen How soft how pliable the Minds of little Children are how like Wax they lie ready to be moulded into any Form and receive any Impression that the diligent Application of Parents thinks fit to make upon them From whence also Parents  are warned  to be very careful that by their Example or Negligence those first softned Circumstances of their Childrens Minds  are not pass'd over  without suitable Applications to forming them a right filling them with Learning and Knowledge and with just Principles both religious and moral  above all  that they receive no bad Impressions from the Practice of their Parents whose Example  especially in Evil  takes such deep Root in their Children that nothing is more difficult to remove    For Warning and serious Caution  by letting them see the dreadful Effects of the neglecting their Children when young what Work it makes for Repentance in both what breaches it makes in Families when Necessity drives them to begin that Work late what Treatment they are like to meet with from their Children how these will think it hard to be instructed when grown up count it imposing upon them in their Parents reject  the Arguments their Parents shall use despise and contemn their Reproof think themselves past Correction and turn their Backs not only upon all the Methods their Parents shall take with them but even upon their Parents themselves when they attempt by Government and Discipline to retrieve the Error they have committed  In this  last Dialogue  the Husband and Wife appear sensible of their Mistake this way and the Difficulties they have before them in retrieving it  justly appear terrible  almost drive them to despair of the Success and to give over any Thoughts of the Attempt in the subsequent Parts of this Work we shall find they were not mistaken in the Prospect they had of the Difficulty before them or of the Obstinacy and Opposition which they should meet with from their Children  As to their being  so discourag'd  as not to make the Attempt the Husband argues wisely that it is not less their Duty for its having been delay'd that it must be set about let the Difficulty be what it will and that therefore  he is resolv'd  to attempt it and if possible to go thro' it leaving the Success to God  This is a wise and Christian Resolution and argues that the Convictions the Parent was under were sanctified by the Spirit of God and carried on to effectual Conversion  for  all Conviction of Sin that do not go on to Reformation and effectual Application to our Duty are ineffectual Convictions  like waking in a Dream  while the Heart is asleep when slumbering on we fall into the same Dream again  For the encouraging Parents to pursue these Convictions and to hope for some success in their Work tho' begun late and under some weighty Discouragements  the following Part of this Work  will shew  how far he met with Success in his Family Reformation and Instruction as well as what Obstruction he met with from his Eldest Children for all were not alike obstinate and refractory as the Eldest were and the Mother was but too true a Prophetess of the Consequence from their Obstinacy  From the Discourse between the Husband and Wife  under their Convictions may be seen something of the Duty of such Relations  To communicate to one another their Griefs and most inward Afflictions of Mind as well as their common Disasters and Troubles of the World This is one Part of the Duty of Husband and Wife to one another  tho' understood by few  meant and included in that Phrase  AN HELPMEET  and it is observable that when such near Relations do affectionately communicate to one another their Souls Concerns  in such a manner as I speak of now  God is often pleas'd so variously to act in the Minds of such by his Spirit that they shall in their Turns be mutually able to assist comfort direct and counsel one another This  if it were well observ'd  would be very useful and encouraging to Christian Relations in their most serious and reserv'd Reflections where they might take notice how that Party that is discourag'd and dejected  to Day  and receives Support and Encouragements Relief and Direction from the Counsel and comforting Assistance  of the other  shall be restor'd and comforted and perhaps enabled  the next time  to give the same Encouragement Counsel Advice and Comfort to the other who may in like manner be sunk under his own Fears and Temptations  This I thought fit to recommend in the most earnest Terms and from just Experience to the  Consideration of Christian Relations as a useful Observation  in hope  it may be improv'd by the Experience of others to the Glory of God and their own Comfort  The Duty of Parents  may be seen here  as it respects the Necessity of setting about the great Work of FamilyReformation  however late  and whatever the Discouragements may be  The Father here  expresses this affectionately to his Wife  Our Children  says he  may be still lost  notwithstanding our Endeavour but we are sure to be lost if we continue to neglect it  From these Considerations  the Father resolves to set about the Work and immediately gives his Wife an Account of the Method he proposes to himself to go upon in which Method like a prudent Man and good Christian he proposes a serious mutual Humiliation  to his Wife  for their former neglect of their Duty and a fervent praying to God for his Blessing upon their Endeavours in their FamilyReformation  Hence is intimated and seriously recommended to Parents and Heads of Families the great Work which is so much neglected or rather so little regarded of a Family joining in Confession of those Sins  I mean of Husband and Wife  which they have joined in the committing would Husbands and Wives join seriously in humbling themselves together before God for those FamilySins which they have join'd in the guilt of FamilyReformation would be set about with much more Earnestness and Application  than now  we see it is and many Obstructions to it which happen by our Willingness to excuse our selves would be removed  From the manner of the Husband and Wife's Discourse here  may be noted  That where  thorough  Conviction  works in the Mind both Parties are  as it is here  forwardest to accuse themselves whereas in most Familycases the Heads of Families seem always forward to shift off the Fault from themselves tho'  they acknowledge  the Error see plainly the defect and the Consequences of it also in the Ruin of their Children yet they are diligent  like Adam and Eve  in throwing the Guilt of it off from themselves either upon one another or upon Accidents and Circumstances which they think may serve  to excuse themselves  but if they were thoroughly touch'd with the thing it self with the Guilt of it upon themselves and the fatal Consequences of it upon their Children they would mutually own the first and deprecate the last as our two Penitent Parents do here  Oh I have ruin'd all my Children  says the Mother  No no you have not ruin'd them It is I have ruin'd them  says the Father  I have neglected my Duty to them  says the Father  But I have been the Cause of your neglecting your Duty  says the Mother  Here is a compleat View for Parents both of the Error the Repentance and the Reformation the Disease the Effects of it and the manner of the Cure and as these are the Foundation of what follows so the following Dialogues are an Exemplification of most of the things contain'd in these Discourses of the two Parents and the Connexion of them will be taken notice of throughout the whole Work  The Fourth DIALOGUE  FOR the better understanding this Discourse it is to be understood that the Father and Mother according to their Resolution in the last Dialogue  had set effectually  about the Reformation of their Family and about proper Methods for reducing their Children to an Obedience  to  and Sence  of  their Duty  Their Children were most of them grown up and had run a great length they had been indulg'd in all possible Folly and Levity such as  Plays Gaming Looseness  of Life and  Irreligious  Behaviour not immodest or dishonest That they were not yet arrived to but they were bred up with  Gayety  and  Gallantry  as being of good Fortunes and Fashion but nothing of Religion more than just the common course of going to Church which they did because it was the Custom and Fashion rather than with any other View and being thus unhappily Educated we shall find the Instruction they were now to bear met with the more Opposition in them and we shall see how it had a various Effect according to the different Temper and Constitution of the Children  Their eldest Daughter was about eighteen Years old and her Mother it seems began with her first Her Mother found it a very difficult matter to deal with her for when she came to tell her of laying by her foolish Romances and Novels  of which she was mighty fond  leaving off her Patches and PlayBooks refusing her going to the Park on the SabbathDays  and the like  she flew out in a Passion and told her Mother  in plain words  she would not be hinder'd she was past a Child she would go to the Park and to the Play  and the like  ay that she would  But  the Mother  whose Resolutions were too well fix'd  after such an Occasion as has been said  to be conquer'd by her Daughter  having try'd softer Methods to no purpose  took her roundly to task and told her That as she took those Measures with her  for her good only  and that she could not satisfie her own Conscience to see her ruin'd  Body  and  Soul  together so she was resolv'd to be obey'd and that since she would not comply by fair means she would take another Course this Course it seems  besides other things which will appear in the following part of this Dialogue  was  particularly  that it being then Sabbath Day after they came home from Church when her Mother began this Discourse her Daughter call'd for the Coach to go to the Park as their Custom it seems had always been but  her Mother  would not suffer her to stir out and upon their being a little stubborn or resolute had used some little Violence with her in shewing her Resentment and threatned her with worse  as will appear presently  Upon this Repulse she flings up Stairs into her Chamber where she sat crying when  her elder Brother  whom the Father it seems  d not yet begun with came to her between which Couple begins the following Dialogue  Brother  SIster  what in Tears what's the matter now  She cries on  but makes no Answer  Bro  Dear Sister  tell me your Grievance  I say tell me  what is it troubles you  And pulls her by her Cloaths  Sist  I won't  don't trouble me  I won't tell you  let me alone  Sobs and cries still  Bro  Prethee what is the matter  Sister  Why you will spoil your Face you won't be fit to go to the Park  come  I came to have you  go out  we will all go to the Park  Sist  Ay  so you may if you can  Bro  If I can  what do you mean by that I have order'd  Thomas  to get the Coach ready  Sist  It's no matter for that  I can assure you  he won't do it  Bro  I'll Cane the Rascal if he don't  and that presently too  come do you wipe your Eyes and don't pretend to go Abroad with a blubber'd Face  Sist  I tell you  Thomas  will not obey you he is otherwise order'd you will find that neither you nor I are to go out to Night  Bro  Who will have the Impudence to hinder us  Sist  I have been hinder'd already and my Mother has told me in so many Words I not only shall not go  to Night  but never any more of a Sunday  tho' I think I shall fail her  Bro  What does my Mother mean by that  not go to the Park  I must go and I will go as long as Sermon is done what harm is there in't  I warrant you we will go  come get you ready and wipe your Eyes  Sist  You'll find your self mistaken in my Mother  I'll assure ye  I told her I would go  as you do me  and she was in such a Passion with me she  struck me which she never did in all her Life before and then read me a long Lecture of the  SabbathDay  and being against her Conscience  and I know not what  Things I never heard her talk of in my Life before I don't know what ails her to be in such a Humour  Bro  Conscience  What does my Mother mean by that  Why have we not gone every  Sunday  to the Park and my Mother always gone with us What is it against her Conscience now and never was against her Conscience before  that's all Nonsense  I'll warrant you I'll go for all this new Bustle you make about it  Sist  I'd go with all my Heart but  I tell you  she is in such a Passion you had better let her alone it will but make her worse  Bro  Prethee don't tell me  I will go to the Park if the Devil stood at the Door what shan't I have the Liberty to go out when I please  Sure I am past a Boy  an't I  Sist  I tell you  my Mother is very positive and you had better let her alone you will but provoke her you may do as you will  Bro  Not I  I won't provoke her at all for I won't ask her I'll go without her  Sist  Then you will go without a Coach too for I assure you as I said before you won't get  Thomas  to go  Bro  Then I'll take a Hackney and go to the Mall  Sist  Come Brother we had better let it alone  for once  my Mother will be better condition'd another time  I hope this will be over  Bro  Nay I don't care  come let's read a Book then  Have you never a Play here Come I'll read a Play to you  Sist  Ay  what will you have  Bro  Any thing  She runs to her Closet for a PlayBook and finds her Plays Novels Songbooks and others of that kind taken all away  Sist  Oh Thieves Thieves I am robb'd  Bro  Robb'd What do you mean Sister  He runs to her  Sist  All my Books are gone they are all gone all stole I han't a Book left  Here you may suppose her taking God's Name in vain very much and in a great Passion  Bro  What all your Books  Sist  Every one that are good for any thing here's nothing  but a Bible  and an old foolish Book about Religion  I don't know what  Her Brother looks  Bro  I think  as you say  they are all gone  No hold  here's a PrayerBook and here's the  Practice of Piety  and here's the  Whole Duty of Man  Sist  Prethee what signify them to me But all my fine Books are gone I had a good Collection of Plays all the  French  Novels all the modern Poets  Boileau Dacier  and a great many more  Bro  What's the meaning of this  Sist  I'll lay  a hundred Pound  this is my Mother  Bro  I believe so too I wish my Mother be not mad This is horrid What can my Mother mean  Sister falls in a great Passion of crying the Second Brother comes up to them and the Father had been talking to him  d Bro  What's the matter with  my Sister  What is she not well  st Bro  I don't know what's the matter  very well  but my Mother has been ruffling her a little and put her out of Humour  Bro  What has she done  Bro  Why She won't let her go to the Park and when she said she  WOƲLD  go  my Mother  struck her and we find she has taken away all her Books I can't imagine what the meaning of this is I think my Mother is mad  Bro  No no Brother  my Mother is not mad if she is mad my Father is mad too you won't want long to know what the Meaning of it is for you will hear of it quickly  too  your self  that I can assure you  Bro  I hear of it  What from my Father  Bro  Yes  from my Father  he has told me his Mind already and the Reason and Occasion of it and I know he is enquiring for you  to do the like  Bro  He may talk what he will to me  but I'll do what I please  for all that  Bro  Hark You are call'd just now you will be of another Mind when you come back  I'll warrant you  The Eldest Son is call'd to come to his Father  Bro  Never  as long as I live  goes out  Bro  If my Father's Reasons do not perswade him  I can assure him  his Authority will  for  he is resolv'd upon the thing  Sist  What thing is it Brother  What is our Father and Mother a going to do with us For my Part I cannot imagine what they mean  Bro  Why really  Sister  I find they have begun with the  Youngest  first for  my Father  has been upon me and  my Mother  has begun with my Sister  Betty  but you will have your Turn too  Sist  I think  my Mother has begun with me already  for I was but humming over a new Song this Afternoon  tho' Church was done and all over  and every body come home but my Mother was  in such a Passion with me  that  I never had so many Words with her in my Life she would not let me go to the Park and had much ado to keep her Hands off of me  Bro  I heard  she was angry with you but  it seems  you answer'd her rudely  Sist  I said nothing  but that I would go to the Park  Bro  Well but you told her you would go  whether she would or no  Sist  Why  was that such a Crime  And so I would say again  Bro  Well  but if you did  you would not say it was well done  would you  And as it seems she told you then  so I can satisfie you now  she will not take it from you nor none of us  as she has done  Sist  It may be so  and I have found it otherwise already  Bro  What  has she not taken some Books  out of your Closet  Sist  Some  No she has only taken all my Books away  Bro  I warrant she has left your  BIBLE  and  Prayer Books  and such as those  Sist  Ay those What does that signifie She has taken away all my Plays and all my Songs and all the Books  that I had any Pleasure in  Bro  Yes  I heard of it  Sist  But I will have them again or I'll lead her such a Life she shall have  little Comfort of me  Bro  Truly Sister you may fancy you may have them again  but I can satisfie you  most of them are past Recovery for I saw them upon the  ParlourFire  before I came up  Sist  THE FIRE  I'll go and pull them out  before her Face  Here she is raging and in a violent Passion at her Mother and makes as if she would run down Stairs  Bro  Come Sister  you had as good be easie  for I find  both our Father and Mother are agreed in the thing and  I must own  I begin to see they have reason for it  For my Part  I am inclin'd to submit to all their Measures for I think in my Conscience  we have all been wrong  and if my Father and Mother see reason to have me alter my Conduct  and especially  when I am convinc'd it is for the bettertoo I think it is my Part to submit  Sist  I'll never submit  The Sister cries again  Bro  Perhaps you will be perswaded when my Mother talks  a little calmly  to you I believe  my Sister Betty  is of another Mind already  Sist  I have had talk enough already  my Mother tells me  I shall not go to the Park nor to the Play house nor patch nor play at Cards  I think this is Talk enough  what does my Mother think to make a Nun of me  Bro  No  I dare say  she does not  Sist  No  and if she does  she will be mistaken  for I shall not be hinder'd of my Innocent Diversions let my Mother do what she pleases  Bro  But Sister  I do not think you will find my Mother unreasonable in what she desires if you will but allow your self Leisure  to think of it  a little  Sist  Unreasonable in her Desires  Prethee  can you tell me what it is she does desire For I cannot imagine what my Mother would be at  Bro  As for my Mother  I cannot be particular but if you are willing to hear me I'll tell you what  my Father  said to me  Sist  You may tell me if you will  tho' I don't much care  I won't be made a Fool of What  I an't a Baby  to go to School again  Bro  Why  look you Sister  you may stand out if you will a great while but  I warrant  you must be content at last for I do not see how you will help your felf  Sist  I warrant you  I'll help my self  Bro  Then you must renounce your  Father  and your  Mother  and leave the Family and I do not see what good that will do you for I am satisfied my Father is resolute  Sist  Resolute  in what prethee  What is it my Father would have Does he think to make us all Fools  What is it he talks of  Bro  I was going to tell you  the short History of it  if you would have Patience  "Early this Morning  before we went to Church  my Father call'd me up into his Chamber and after enquiring several things of me  about  my Learning my Company and my Behaviour in the World to which I made as good an Answer as I could  he told me  with a great deal of Tenderness  that  he lov'd me very dearly  that  he intended to do very well for me  that  he had a particular Kindness for me and  that  he had but one thing he desir'd of me and that this was for my own Good too and desir'd to know if I was disposed to comply with him I told him  I was very willing to do any thing to oblige him who had been so good a Father to me  He told me all he desir'd of me  was this  He had observ'd that his Family in general was running on into all kind of Levity and Loosness which he was satisfied would be their Ruin  That  he had been remiss in his Duty of Instruction and Reproof to his  Children but that he begg'd God Pardon for that Omission and would do his best to make us all amends He concluded with asking me whether I had rather  be a Rake  or a  Sober Man  I answer'd I hop'd he did not expect any Reply from me to that and that I hop'd I had not gone so far as to make him doubt in the least that I did not design to be a Sober Man  Why Son  replies my Father you have no other way to do this but to conclude that if there were  no  Divine Law  no  Future State  no  Rewards or Punishments yet regarding the Honour and Character which you expect in the World you ought to be Sober if it were only to preserve your Reputation  He told me  that I knew he had design'd me for the Practice of the Law that tho' he would do what he could for me yet as he had a great many other Children I must expect to live  or at least to advance my self  by my own Merit and Industry and that a Lawyer like a Virgin having once lost the Reputation of his Virtue or Sobriety no body will meddle with him  "I not only listned very attentively to my Father's Discourse but looking steadily upon him I thought I saw more than usual Tenderness and Affection in him all the while he was speaking  whenever  he mention'd his having omitted his Duty to his Family I thought I saw Tears standing in his Eyes and to hear him say he begg'd God's Pardon for the neglect of it  brought Tears into mine  when he told me he would make us all amends for the future it suggested to my Mind that my Father supposed that this want of more early instructing us  who are his Children  was  our Loss  as well as  his Fault  and that we were not such Children as we should  have been  if we had been better taught  I must own to you  Sister  these Thoughts have since made a great Disturbance in my Mind I thought I saw the Two young Ladies at next Door and their Brother too look'd quite another Sort of People  than we did  they appear  so  modest  so  sober and yet  so  decently and genteely affable and pleasant that I think they live quite another Lite than we do  They never  swear nor use lewd and prophane Words in their Discourse  they never  sit up all Night at Cards or go a Visiting a  Sundays  nor do a hundred foolish things that our Family makes a Trade of  and yet  they live as merrily comfortably sociably and genteely as we do  "  I must own to you  tho' I have often laugh'd at them and ridicul'd them before yet my Thoughts often told me they liv'd a more rational Life than we did and when I heard my Father talk thus it presently came into my Thoughts That if my Father took the new Course with his Family  as he talk'd of  we should begin to be like them and I thought that would be very well for us all  "Well after my Father had gone on thus and paus'd a while  I suppose to hear whether I would say any thing to it or no  I told him I would be glad to do any thing to answer his End and desired to know what it was he expected of me  My Father said  The chief End of his Discourse was then to convince me of the Reasonableness and Necessity of an Alteration in my Life and of the Advantages of a Religious Family and of a sober religious Education and for the rest if I was first satisfied of the general he knew it would be easie to bring me to comply with all the Measures he should take to bring it about  We had a great deal more such Discourse but I told him I was very well satisfied that he design'd nothing but our Good and I should be ready to observe all the Injunctions he should lay on me and  truly Sister  now I begin to reflect upon it I find a great deal of Satisfaction in it  for upon my Word  I think we have liv'd very odly all along whether it were my Father's Fault or our own I don't enquire but if we knew no more  none of us  of the Town than we do of Religion we should be a very unfashionable Family  Sist  Prithee don't fill my Head with all this  canting Stuff  I don't value it a Farthing  Bro  Why  Sister  have you no manner of Inclination to live Religiously and  like a Christian  or to listen to what your Father may say to you  Sist  I think I am Religious enough in all Conscience and I don't intend to disturb my Thoughts with any more Religion than needs must  Bro  You talk wildly now  I hope  you would be a good Christian  Sist  A Christian  Why what do you take me for a  Mahometan  I think I am a very good Christian  Bro  Why  suppose that too  yet if it were no more than that my Father desires it and says he resolves to have it so you will hardly perswade your self not to submit to him  you know  besides that he is our Father and we ought in Duty to obey him and not only that but he has been the kindest tenderest obliging'st Father in the World  TO ƲS  and it would be very ungrateful to show your self rude to such a Father as it would be wicked to disobey him  I am sure  you would not be a Christian if you should  Sist  Don't tell me  I think my self as good a Christian as any of you but I won't be made a  Fool of  for all that  I had as live you should think me  no Christian  as you should think me a Fool  sure  I am past my  Horn book  Bro  And what because you are past your  Hornbook  do you think you are past teaching Have you nothing to learn but your  A B C  Sist  No no  I'll learn any thing too but I won't be taught to be a Hermit if they have a Mind to breed me up for an Abbess let them send me to a Monastery I'd as live be in a real  Cloister  as be  Cloister'd up  at Home use none of your  new Cant  with me  I tell you Brother  my Mother may ruffle me as much as she will I'll have my own Way still  Bro  Sister Sister  You may talk and huff and flounce about as much as you will but you will have the worst of it at last for if both  Father  and  Mother  set upon it  as I find they are both of a Mind  they will conquer you at last and perhaps it may mortifie you more than you think of  Sist  I am not so soon conquer'd  as my Father may think  if they won't let me be quiet at Home I'll take another Method I am not so much to seek  Bro  Pray Sister don't be angry with me for my Goodwill I'm not threatning you nor my Father by me  Sist  No no I won't be threatned neither  sure  I'm too old for Correction  Bro  But not for Advice  I hope Sister nor  for Instruction and if my Father should think you deserv'd  Correction  do you think there is no way for him to show his Resentment  but laying his Fingers on you  Sist  You may all do your worst  I won't trouble my self about it  'tis in vain to threaten me  Bro  Nay Sister I think you are so above my Father's threatning you  that you talk as if you were threatning him  would you be willing my Father should hear you  Sist  You may tell him if you please  Bro  Tho' that is very disobliging  Sister  yet I love you too well to go of that Errand or to obey a Command that would be so much to your Prejudice  Sist  I care not a Farthing if you did  Bro  It is a Satisfaction to me that I know you will be of another Mind hereafter  Sist  Not I  I defie you all I'll go as far as my Legs can carry me before I'll be confin'd or made a Fool of  Bro  Whereever you go I would have you take this Hint with you That you  leave your Reputation behind you  and especially  the Christian  will be left behind you  Sist  Don't you trouble your Head about that I shall take care of my own Reputation  Bro  While it is in your own keeping  I hope you will Sister  but you talk foolishly enough of  going away from your Father  if you once go out of your Father's Doors take my Word for it your Character is at every Body's Mercy  Sist  For what  pray  Bro  Why should you ask for what Pray  what will you say  or what would you have said to any  that shall ask you  or  ask us  why you are gone away from your Father  you won't venture to say  that you  came away  because your Father was about to reform his Family  That you came away  because you would not submit to be instructed by your Father  That you came away  because your Father and Mother would have you more Religious than you were before And  if you will not  say that  pray what can you say or what can any body say for you  Sist  I warrant you  I shall have enough to say  and as for what  you  or  others  shall say  you may say your worst of me  I don't care  Bro  Truly  the greatest Misfortune will be that when we say  the worst  we shall say the Truth  and that  when we say the Truth we must say  the worst of you  that can be spoken and upon that Account I hope you will consider what you do when you think of going from your Father's House  tho' it were to the best Friend you had  Sist  Indeed  if they put hard upon me  I shall make no Scruple of it  Bro  I cannot tell what you will say then  to bring your self off  Pray what do you call  putting hard  upon you Will you call my Father's Desire to reform your Life  a putting hard upon you  I hope you will first prove that he designs to press you to  some wicked thing  some forbidden unlawful Course but to call my Father's Desire to regulate your Conduct and reform your Life I say to call this  putting hard upon you  every body that hears it will reflect upon you  Sist  No matter for that  I won't be confin'd not I  Bro  Not from the worst Wickedness  Do you mean you will not be confin'd so  Sist  I desire no Wickedness  I don't know what you mean  I have never expos'd my self yet to be charged with any Wickedness  Bro  But you will do it now  it seems  because your Father requires you  to be sober  Sist  Prethee what do you mean by  sober  I thick I am sober enough and want no more reforming than any of you  what would you have  Bro  I am no way taxing your Sobriety but should be very glad you would encrease the Stock and improve it and I believe my Father means no other  Sist  Can't I be sober as well with all my Books my Mother has taken away  as without them  What can you tax me with that  is not sober  that here is such a Rout about it  Bro  Dear Sister  I do not find that my Father or Mother is inclin'd to tax you in particular  any more than all of us  but all of us together nay even our Father and Mother themselves have been negligent godless and graceless and if they now resolve to repent and turn and to carry it after another manner and to have us do the same  pray what taxing can you call this  Does not my Father say he confesses he has been negligent and has not done his Duty  as well as any of us  And what is all he desires of us  But only  that as he begs Pardon of Almighty God for himself  so  we should ask the same for our selves  that as  he resolves to reform the Practice  so we  should do also  that so  at last we may be a sober Family a reform'd Family and may serve God for the future after another manner than we have done  pray where's the Hardship of all this  Sist  Well  you may go on with your Reformation and Confessions  and all that  if you have a Mind for my Part I'll have  nothing to do with it  I'll let you all go your own way  Bro  Well Sister  I am sorry for you if you hold of this Mind we are like to have  a foul House with you quickly  for I know my Father will go thro' stitch with what he has begun  Sist  My Father  may go on with what he will I shan't hinder him  he may let me alone  and reform the rest of you can't he I need no Reformation  as I know of  Bro  I am not so sorry for the Difficulty my Father will meet with  as for the Hazard you will run for your self  and the Breach you will make in your own Happiness but here comes my  Sister Betty  I see by her Looks she has something to say upon the same Subject  d Sist  How long have  you too  been together  d Bro  A great while  Sist  I suppose I know  something of your Discourse  at least I guess at it by your looking so grave  Pray  how long have you been  here  Bro  I told you a great while  but since you would be answer'd particularly  I believe we have been here  just as long  as you have been with my Mother  for I know  she has been talking to you  Sist  That's true my Mother and I have been talking  Sist  Talking  do you say  or Fighting  Sist  Fighting  What do you mean  Sister  Do you think I fight with my Mother  Sist  No  but it may be your Mother may fight with you why not  with you  as well as  with your Elder Sister  Sist  My Mother never struck me in her Life and I never gave her any Cause that I know of  Sist  That's more than I can say  and yet I think I never gave her any more Cause than you did  Sist  If my Mother has struck you  certainly you must ha' given her more Cause than I have done  for every body knows she loves you  to a distinction  above every Child she has  Sist  I don't believe a word of it nor do I desire  such Love  Bro  Well Sister  but you may tell us a little how you like things and what Discourse my Mother has had  with you  for we all know the Subject already  Sist  My Mother said nothing to me  but what I like very well  and am very willing to comply with  Bro  I am very glad to hear you say so  I wish we were all of the same Mind  Sist  I hope we shall  I think what she proposes is so rational and the Reasons of it so unanswerably good that I see no room to object against it  in the least  nor do I see any thing design'd in it all but what is for our Good  Bro  I am perfectly of your Opinion and am glad to find you of mine  but here is my Sister MARY  quite of different Sentiments from us all  Sist  And  with a great deal of Reason  for she has not been treated with the same Kindness that you have been treated with  Sist  Wherein pray  Sist  Why I suppose my Mother has not been in your Chamber and rifled your Closet and taken all your choice Books and your Plays and your Songs and your Novels  c  and carried them away and thrown them into the Fire  Sist  No no my Dear  For what my Mother said to me was  so  affecting  so  fully convincing and  so  unanswerable that I immediately fetch'd them all down my self and put them into the Fire  with my own Hands  before her Face  Sist  A pretty complying easie Fool  I warrant she kiss'd thee  and call'd thee  dear Child  and cry'd over thee for thy Pains did she not  my Dear  Sist  I am asham'd to hear you talk so  of my Mother  Sister sure you ha'n't lost your  Manners  and  Duty  as well as Respect and Religion  Sister  I beseech you what is the Matter with you  Sist  And have you really burnt all your Plays to please a Humour  Sist  Indeed I have burnt them but not to please a Humour I have done it to oblige the best Mother in the World and I have done it from a Sense of its being very fit to be done  Sist  A fine Child  And are not you a deal the wiser for it do you not repent it already  Sist  No Sister  So far from repenting it that I never did a thing in my Life that gave me more Satisfaction and  if it were to do again  I should now do it with Ten times the Pleasure I did it then and if God give me Grace to keep my Resolution I never design to see a Play or read a Play more  Sist  Pretty Child  Thoroughly reform'd  at once  This is a mighty sudden Conversion and may hold accordingly  I suppose  as most such hasty things do  Sist  It will hold I hope  longer than your Obinacy against it  Sist  When it has  as good Reasons  I may think so too  Sist  I shall debate that with you hereafter when you have heard the same Reasons for it that I have heard  Sist  Well but come  pray let's have a few of your Reasons  just now if you can spare them pray what harm is there in seeing or reading a Play Is there any sufficient Mischief in them to justifie your burning them and to justifie my Mother's using me about them  as she has done  Sist  In the first Place Sister  the Time we have before us compar'd to the Eternity that is to be prepar'd for is  so  little and  so  short that if it be possible to employ it better there is none to spare for what has so little Good in it  as a Play  Sist  I have learnt a great deal  of Good  from a Play  Sist  But might you not have learnt more from the Scriptures  Sist  It may be not  Sist  You would have been a bad Scholar then  Sist  Well  and what's next  Sist  In the second Place  the little Good which you  can pretend  is to be found in them is mix'd with  so much Evil  attended with  so much lewd vicious and abominable Stuff  that no sober Person will bear with the  wicked Part  for the sake of the  good Part  nor can any one justifie it that the good Part is such  or so great  that so much Hazard should be run for it  Sist  Very well  so you are afraid you should be tempted  when you go to the Play  I suppose that is because you are so tempting your self  Sist  No Sister  I am in no more danger  I hope  than another but sure if I am to pray to God as in the Lord's Prayer  Lead me not into Temptation  I must not  lead my self  into it  Sist  And is this  all you have to say  for throwing the best Collection of Plays the whole Town had into the Fire  Sist  I have many more Reasons which I shall bestow on you  when you have answer'd these  but there is one more which I will bestow upon you now which you may give an Answer to before the rest if you please  viz  That it is my  Mother's  Desire and Resolution that I should do so and that she declares it is against her Conscience to permit me the use of these things  as formerly  and therefore desires and in  one kind  commands that I should do thus and I am bid in the Scripture many ways to obey  Children obey your Parents in all things  c  Sist  That is the best Reason you have given yet  Sist  I think not  neither  for the other Reasons  are better  as they are drawn from the Nature and Authority of God  and this  but from the Authority of my Mother which tho' it is great and ought to be very prevalent  with me  and ever shall be so yet not quite equal or up to the Authority of him that made us all nor will my Mother think hard that I say so  Bro  Sister  Indeed I think  my Sister  Betty  has fully answer'd you there  Sist  Yes yes  you are two fine new Converts  Bro  Which I hope we shall never be asham'd of  Sist  Well  and pray what said you to her about going to the Park a  Sundays  Had you nothing to say about that  Sist  Yes yes my Mother shewed her Dislike of it and said it was a plain Violation of the Commands of God  I mused a little while about it  and being convinc'd that it was so I presently resolved never to go any more  Sist  So  and you had not a Box on the Ear then  as I had  Sist  I gave my Mother no Occasion for that  Sister  as I understand  you did  Sist  No no  You are a mighty good obedient thing  Sist  I am not asham'd to own  that I obey my Mother  and am willing to do so in every thing  especially  every thing that is right  more especially  in every thing that is for my own Good and  most of all  where my Duty to God joins with it if you think it below you to do so I am sorry for it I cannot follow you in that Example for the Scripture says expresly  Children obey your Parents in all things  much more where the Command of God and the Command of our Parents  concur together  as it does in this Case  Sist  You preach nicely  Sister  You shall marry a Parson and when you turn  Quaker  you shall be a  speaking Sister  Sist  Any thing rather than a Rebel to God and my Parents break the Commandments of the first and abuse the Tenderness of the last  Sist  You are mighty mannerly  to your Sister  Sist  Much more to you  than you  to my Mother  I love my Sister very well  but I know neither  Brother  or  Sister  when they rise up against my Mother and that  such a Mother  as ours is who I must tell you  Sister  deserves other things at your Hands and unless you behave better you will find the whole Family against you  as well as I  for every body says you treated my Mother  very rudely  the very Servants speak of it with Abhorrence and of you with Contempt for  every body must despise you  if you carry it so to your Mother  Sist  With all my Heart if  every body  despises me  I'll despise every body  and so I'll be even with you all  Sist  You'll be soon tir'd of that  Sist  If I am  I'll bear my Affliction with Patience  Sist  You are like to be a Martyr in the worst Cause  that ever Saint suffered in  no doubt but you will suffer for Conscience sake Two Excellent Points in Divinity you maintain  viz Contempt of God  and  Rebellion against your Parents  I wonder what  Evil Spirit  is your Instructor  Sist  You are very pert  Madam  and shew abundance of Affection and Respect  Sist  I follow  your own Example still  Sister but I'll be very honest to you I'll neither have  Respect  nor  Affection  to you or any body that shall carry it to my Mother as you have done I would not  load you  or add to your Sorrows  but no body in this House can do otherwise who have such a Father and such a Mother as we have  Sist  I have no Sorrow about it  and am resolved  I will have none  Sist  I think the best way to deal with you is to leave you your Crime will be your sufficient Punishment But I must tell you  before I go  which I should have told you  at first  that my Business was  not to visit you now  but to call you to my Father and Mother who want to speak with you  in the Parlour  and where I suppose you will hear more of it  Sist  I won't go  Sist  As you ploase Sister for that  I have delivered my Message  Sist  And you may carry that for an Answer  Sist  No Sister  I'll have no Hand in your Misfortunes  besides I believe here comes another Messenger from them  A Servant comes up Stairs and tells the Eldest Lady that her Father and Mother waited to speak with her  Sist  I am indisposed  tell my Mother  I can't come I am upon the Bed  Servant  If you won't go  Madam  I doubt they will come to you  Sist  Go you and deliver your Message  Sist  And are you so resolute against your self Sister Can nothing perswade you to your own Good Certainly you will be wiser  Sist  What would you have me do  What is the matter with you all  Sist  Nay  Sister I am not fit to give you Advice who are my Elder Sister but methinks you do not want Advice to go down to your Father when you are sent for  Sist  I won't  Sist  What shall I say to them  I dare not say  you won't  for your own Sake  Sist  Tell them  I an't well can't you  That I am upon the Bed and have shut my Door and won't be spoke with  tell them any thing  Don't you see I an't fit to be spoke to  Sist  As the Maid said  I am certain  they'll come up to you for they know your Distemper I would fain have you go down  I dare say  you will be treated very tenderly and kindly Perhaps better than you can expect especially if you do not force them to treat you ill  Sist  Yes After they have burnt all my Books robb'd me of what they knew was my Delight refus'd me the Liberty of going abroad and given me a Blow in the Face for nothing now they'll treat me kindly  will they  I desire none of their Kindness  I won't go  Sist  Well Sister  then they must wait upon you  I suppose  Sist  If they do I won't speak to them  She cries vehemently  or open the Door  Sist  I hope you will alter your Mind  I'll leave you to think of it  The Second Sister withdraws and the other claps the Door after her  THIS Dialogue needs no Observation save on the different Temper between Children dutifully submitting to FamilyGovernment and affectionately complying with their Parents just Desires and on the other hand Children obstinately adhering to the Dictates of their Passions and this will appear to every common Reader besides much of this  first Part  being Historical and the Family known I forbear farther Observations on the particular Conduct of the Persons The Design of this Work being rather to instruct other Families than to reproach those who may think themselves concern'd The Author leaves these Dialogues therefore without particular Remarks and leaves Room for abler Hands to annotate upon them hereafter when the Persons concern'd may be gone off the Stage and then it may rather appear as a general Reproach to those that are guilty than a patticular Satyr upon Persons or Families and this he conceives will also tend more to the Usefulness of the Work  End of the Fourth Dialogue  The Fifth DIALOGUE  THE last Dialogue is a kind of a  Sketch  or Draught of the whole Family we are speaking of The Eldest  Son  and  Daughter  as their Father and Mother had suggested being grown up in a long allow'd Course of Loosness in Behaviour all manner of Liberties having been given them without any FamilyRestraint  without Government  and rather encourag'd by their Parents  than limited  either by Example or Command prov'd  as might well be expected  very obstinate and refractory  especially the Daughter  who being hot and insolent her Mother  at the first Attempt  was so provok'd as to use her somewhat roughly The other Children who were grown up  being also a Son and a Daughter  are not only brought to submit to the Reformation proposed by their Parents but embrace it with Willingness and Chearfulness and make their Duty be their Choice to the great Satisfaction of their Parents  The following Dialogue  is between the Father and Mother with their said  Sons  and  Daughters  respectively  and apart  which are the same that are referred to in the former Discourses  The Mother it seems began with her Eldest Daughter upon something in her Behaviour about breaking the  Sabbath  and this by the Imprudence of the Daughter ended rougher than she  the Mother  design'd it  The Father began with his  Second Son  and finding him very tractable proceeded to his Eldest Son but met with great Difficulties and Discouragements in him  The Mother found the  Second Daughter  sensibly affected with her Discourse and chearfully willing to submit to her Instructions which was a great Comfort to her and encourag'd her to deal the better with her obstinate Sister  Their other Children were younger and rather to be govern'd by Authority than Perswasion The Dialogue with the Eldest Daughter  began thus  After Sermon every Lord's Day it had been their Custom to walk abroad or go to the Park or a Visiting  and so to wear off the Evening  and then come Home to Supper but the Case being now alter'd  the Father  had let the Servants know they must all stay at Home and had told his Younger Son with whom he had discoursed in the Morning that he would have no more going to the Park on the Lord's Day but the Daughter had not yet heard of it nor the Eldest Son  or if they had  they did not believe their Father was in earnest so that according to their usual Custom they were preparing to go abroad and the  Son  had bid their Coachman get ready to carry them out the Mother perceiving the Daughter to be putting on her Gloves calls to her thus  Mother  WHat are you Dressing for  Child  Daughter  To go to the Park Madam  Mo  I would not have you go to Night  my Dear  Dau  Why Madam  Mo  I have a Reason which I had rather tell you another time  Note  the Mother having design'd to have a serious Discourse with her Daughter did not think fit to enter into Particulars now but her Daughter's Carriage forc'd her to it  Dau  I must go  Madam  I have appointed Company  Mo  Well however disappoint them for once  at my desire  Dau  It's impossible  Madam  I can't do it  Mo  O the Impossibility is not so very great as you make it  I warrant you  you can excuse it  Dau  I never did such a Thing in my Life  'tis rude Madam to the last Degree  I cannot look my Lady  Lighthead  in the Face  Mo  Lay the Fault on me  my dear  I'll bear the Blame  Dau  I'll ev'n lay the Fault on no body nor ask any body Pardon  but go my self  Mo  I wonder  Child  you should force me to the Necessity of telling you  that you must not go  Dau  Why Madam  I must go I can't put it off  Mo  But I tell you  Mistress  since you will be put off no other way you shall not go  Dau  Shan't I  Mo  No  you shan't  Dau  But  I will go  Mo  I never thought to have had such Language as that  from you Daughter  and I assure you I shall not take much of it  Dau  Why should not I go out then  as well now  as at another time  Mo  Why Daughter  since I must come to Particulars with you I assure you that you shall not  only  not go  to the Park  to Day  but never any more of a  SabbathDay  as long as I have the troublesome Office  of being your Mother  Dau  What have I done to be used so  Mo  Nothing more than the rest  nor was I blaming you  but you have been all guilty of prophaning the Lord's Day and to the best of my Power you shall do it no more  Dau  Why han't you done it  your self  And have you not always gone with us  Mo  Tho' that is very unnatural and unmannerly in you to reproach me with it yet I confess it is but too just upon me  and I deserve it  however I pray God forgive me  that I have done it  and especially that I have let you all do it well may you upbraid me with it  and I desire to be ashamed  that you have had my Example to encourage you to it but it is the more my Duty to reform it and I expect your Compliance with the more Willingness  Dau  I see no harm in it not I  Mo  What not on the  Lord's Day  Dau  No  As long as Sermon is over and Church is done  Mo  Why  does not the Commandment say  Remember the SabbathDay to keep it holy and therefore God blessed the SabbathDay and HALLOWED it  Dau  Why  don't I keep it  Holy enough  don't I go to Church every  Sunday  Mo  Well  and do you think that the  SabbathDay  is over when you have been at Church  Dau  Over  Why what would you have us do after we have been at Church  Mo  I shall take a Time to let you know what is your Duty on the rest of the Day but I did not design to talk of that now  nor of this neither  if you had not mov'd me to it by your undutiful Language  Dau  I don't trouble my self about it  Here the Daughter turns away and with a kind of a humming low Voice  sings  the Tune of  a new  Playhouse  Song  Mo  Unsufferable Insolence Have I been telling you of the Command of God to keep holy the  Sabbath Day  and of my Resolution to do it my self  and to cause you to do it  and do you despise God and your Mother at this rate  It is not to be born with  She first apparently laughs at her Mother and turning awayfrom her sings on  Mo  Your Contempt of your Mother  I place to my own Account  but for your Contempt of your Maker  Takes that  on God's Account  Strikes her a Box on the Ear  Dau  Ha  Is it come to that  The Daughter flies away in a  Rage  and goes up Stairs towards her Chamber  Mo  Only take this with you in your Fury  That I'll have no going out of door  Dau  But I will  for all this  Mo  I advise you to provoke me  no farther  Dau  You have done your worst  The Mother provok'd highly by her Tongue  follows her  and goes into her Chamber but she had gone into another Room and the Mother seeing the Closetdoor open in her Chamber goes in and takes away  all her Books  PLAYS SONGS  c  leaving only her  Bible Prayerbooks  and two or three good Books in their Room  Mo  These are the cursed Roots from whence this blessed Fruit grows up Here her SabbathDays  Study and the Bait to all her Pleasures These shall be the first Sacrifice to the bessed Resolution I have taken  of reforming my Family  The Mother brings them all down Stairs and after looking over the Particulars threw them all into the Fire  The Daughter going afterwards into her Chamber and finding what her Mother had done occasioned the Dialogue already set down between her and her Eldest Brother  This little Adventure being over and the Mother having composed herself she sends for her Second Daughter about Fifteen Year Old and begins the following Dialogue with her  Mother  Child  Where are you  What  are you bespoke to Night too  d Dau  No Madam  who should bespeak me  Mo  Why your Sister to go to the Park  Dau  No indeed  Madam  I know nothing of it and  if she had  I have no Inclination to it  Mo  How so  Dau  I don't know but  I never cared for it a Sundays  but when you go and every body  and then I must  Mo  Dear Child  don't cut me  to the Heart  by telling me of my going Your Sister has upbraided me with it just now in her Fury but your innocent Way of telling me of it  sinks deeper still  Dau  Ʋpbraid you Madam  It's impossible I hope  my Sister  is not gone mad sure you won't call my speaking so upbraiding you with any thing  I abhor it  Mo  But  my dear  I upbraid my self with it  Dau  God forbid I should do it  dear Mother  u t was there any harm in your going  Mo  Only the wickedest thing  in me  that I was capable of doing especially as it was an Example to you  my dear  and to your Brothers and Sisters  Dau  But if it was a wicked thing  Mother  it was so in me too was it not  Mo  Most certainly  Dau  I cannot tell what it was but I had always some Uneasiness when I was out at the Park or a Visiting  on the Sabbathday  but I consider'd  my Mother  was with me and sure it could not be wrong  THEN  and that carried me on but  dear Mother  do not call this upbraiding you with it  it would break my Heart  to have you think so  Mo  I don't  my dear  but I cannot help upbraiding my self with it though no body in the World was to upbraid me with it for I have run the risque of ruining thee  my dear  and all the rest of my Children both  Soul  and  Body  and I am afraid some of them are quite ruined already  Dau  I won't be one of them  Mother  I'll do any thing you shall direct me to  Mo  I would be glad to direct you for the best  my dear  but the Work has been so long neglected  I am almost discouraged  and know not  where to begin  or how to hope for Success  Dau  Why  dear Mother  I hope I am not so hard to be instructed or so backward to learn I am sure I am willing to change my course of Life for a better  not only  out of Obedience to you  as you are my Mother  but out of meer Inclination and Choice for I have often thought we were not in the Way  to do our selves good  and that the Life we led  was not  as it should be  Mo  I thank God for that Foundation laid in thee  my dear  and hope the Rules for Amendment will be the more agreeable  Dau  Dear Mother  all your Rules shall be agreeable to me but more especially such Rules as shall deliver me from  the Evil  of an irregular Life sure I cannot be so ungrateful as to neglect the Directions you shall give so much to my own Advantage  Mo  My dear  It is true that  bare Amendment of Life  is not all the Duty that is before us it is not enough that we forbear the Follies which we have so long committed but we must perform the Duties we are commanded a Christian's Life consists as well in discharging commanded Duties as in avoiding forbidden Evils  BOTH  must be done and  BOTH  submitted to chearfully  Dau  I have been uneasie a great while at the Life we live I always thought it was not right but I did not know what Course to take  to alter it  nor what I ought to do  or not to do  besides  I thought  if I should refuse going to the Play and refuse going abroad  on the Sabbathday  I should anger  you Madam  for I always found  you were for them  and yet I cannot say I took any Pleasure in them but saw other Families  did not do so  and I thought they  look'd soberer  and  liv'd better  than ours I thought my self in Heaven  last Winter  when you let me stay at my Aunt's a few Weeks  Mo  And yet these are the very things  your Sister calls  the Pleasure of her Life  Dau  Much good may they do her  Mo  And puts so much Value upon them  that  she will affront her Mother at any time  rather than  deny herself the least Satisfaction of that kind  Dau  She shall have  all my Share  in the Pleasure at a very low Price  Mo  Indeed she provoked me  just now  to the highest Degree when I saw her preparing to go to the Park and desired her to put it off she told  me  'twas impossible  and her Honour was engag'd because  forsooth  she had made an Appointment to meet the young Lady  Lighthead  Dau  Her Honour engag'd What her Honour engag'd to break God's Commandments  Sure Madam  you did not tell her  as you do me  of the  fourth Commandment Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbathday  Mo  Yes I did several times  and when  at last  I added my own Authority and told her  she should not go  she told me flat and plain  she would go  Dau  I am amaz'd  Mo  Nay I ought not to wonder  for  when she had laugh'd at its being a breach of God's Command  how could I expect  she would lay any weight upon mine  Dau  It is impossible  Certainly she could never do it in Contempt of the Commandment she must rather pretend it was Lawful and that it did not break the Command  Mo  No my dear  no body breaks the Commandments of God avowedly and obstinately  as God's Command  no body is so abbsurdly wicked  as to say  I will break God's Commandments in defiance of him but she pretended there was  no harm in it  because  Sermon was done  as if God who hallowed the  Sabbathday  had only hallowed  so much of it  as was taken up in the publick Worship and no Part of the Sabbath was to be kept holy  but the Sermon time  Dau  That's the Divinity of the Day  Madam  Mo  Nay  and which is still more ridiculous  as if  one Part of the Day being dedicated  to the best things  the worst were to come  just in the Heels  of them I must own I think People had better  open their Shops  as soon as Sermon is done and fall to their Business  every Sabbath Evening  for  sure  it  would be less Sin to spend the Day in Lawful Employments  than in Sports and Recreations  Worship and Diversion is putting the  Two Extreams  next to one another and it seems a Contempt of the Day to set one piece of it apart  for the best things  and the other  for the meanest  for Recreation is the meanest lawful thing that can be done but your Sister thinks her Pleasure the reason of her Life and the endfor which she was born  Dau  Then she seems to be born for very little Purpose I hope I am born for something else  Madam  Mo  Yes  she thinks  seeing and reading  Plays  Company Visits the Park and the  Mall  such material Points of Life and so essential to her Happiness that she will not only contradict my Authority  but God's Command  rather than not enjoy them  Dau  I know Plays and Romances have been too much  my Sister's Study  and  mine too  but I confess I see nothing in them  now  so diverting as I have thought of them  but if I did  if I thought it was displeasing to you  Mother  more  if I thought  it was an Error or an Enemy to Religion and Virtue I would soon let you see what my real Value for them is  Mo  How dear they are to your Sister  you will know to her just Reproach  when you come to hear how she treats me  for taking them from her  and how dear they are to me  you may guess  by my having put them into the Fire just now  Dau  I am sorry for my Sister and especially  dear Mother  that you should meet with so much Affliction in your Children but depend upon it  Madam  you shall meet with nothing from me  to add to it  and as to PlayBooks and Novels I hope if they were no way offensive on a Religious Account  I could sacrifice them all  to give Satisfaction to my Mother  Mo  My dear  can you do so  The Mother weeps for Joy  Dau  I'll soon put you out of that Doubt  Madam  if you'll have Patience till I fetch them  She runs up Stairs to her Closet  Mo  Well how said my Husband  to me  that if we bgan this Work heartily it would perhaps be blessed and succeeded  from above  beyond our Expectation How does  this dear Child  close chearfully with the very first Notion of a Reformation  Who knows  but God  in time  will mollifie the Obstinacy of  her Sister  This shall however encourage me  to go on  with my Work  to continue  instructing and exhorting her and not despair of a Blessing  tho'  the Difficulties by reason of a long Delay and Neglect have been doubled upon me  The Daughter returns with a Servant and their Laps both full of  Songs Plays Novels Romances  and such like Stuff and throws them down on the Table  Dau  Here Madam  is the willing'st Sacrifice ever I made in my Life  Mo  And do you do this freely my Dear  Dau  With more Pleasure  Madam  than ever I read them and I resolve them to the Fire  Moth  I think  my dear  thou art the only qualified Person to be trusted with them because  if there be any such thing as good in them  which I will not say there is  thou alone  art able to pick it out  without  touching or being tainted with the bad of tasting what has any Relish without being  soil'd  with the Dirt  or infected  with the Disease of the other  Dau  Well Madam  but were I so capable I am not above being entic'd and besides other of my  Brothers  and  Sisters  may  my  Example  their  Rule or may claim to use them tho' in my  Possession I had rather have them follow my Sister's and therefore make it my Desire  Madam  in order to put an Argument into your Mouth  from my Example  that I may put them all into the Fire with my own Hand  She throws them in  Mo  The Blessing of thy Father and Mother be upon thee  my dear Child  Thou hast made my Heart rejoice  that was almost sunk before  for fear lest all my Children were irrecoverably lost by my neglect of their more early Instruction  Dau  My dear Mother  I am happier in that Blessing than in all that ever you gave me before  Mo  What wilt thou say my Dear to thy  Sister  when she hears of it  Dau  Nay  Madam  what will my Sister say  to me  when she shall know that I have heard how she us'd  my Mother  for a few  Ballads  and  PlayBooks  Mo  She will mock and flout at thee  my dear  Dau  Then I'll pity her  Madam  for I am sure she is in a worse Condition  than I  I have your Blessing and Affection  Madam  which I value above all the World and she has a heap of  Plays  and  Novels  in the room of it  Mo  My Blessing  my dear  Alas what is that May He be thy Blessing whose Blessing  maketh rich and adds no Sorrow to it  if God gives thee Grace to go on thou wilt be a Blessing to me rather than I to thee for I have been the Ruin of you all and have brought you into the danger of being never recall'd for want of instructing you before  Dau  Dear Mother  do not load your self with that  I hope  it is not too late for us to learn now  Mo  It is very late  my dear  very late and what would have been easily taught and easily learnt  before  will be hard now  both ways  I fear my Dear you do not see what other things are necessary to be done  Dau  What things are they  Madam  Mo  Why my Dear on our Part  thy Father and I  we must set up a FamilyGovernment entirely new  We must  be angry  now  at what we were pleas'd at  before  and pleas'd now with what we were angry at  before  What we laugh'd at and made a Jest of in our Children before we must  now  mourn over and correct them for What we not only allow'd to be done  but  even  did our selves before  we must forbid  now  What we accounted pleasant  before  must be frightful  now  and what we delighted in  before  must be dreadful to us  now IN SHORT  every Part of our Government or of our Children's Obedience must be alter'd O the Task that I have to go through O the difficulty of a late Reformation in a Family  Dau  I cannot understand what all this mighty Change must be  Madam  or wherein there will be so much Difficulty  sure  none of the Family can be backward to listen to such Directions  as you will give them  will any of my  Brothers  and  Sisters  be against being made better or render your Task difficult when it may be made  so easie  and when so much for their own good I am sure I will not  Mother  Mo  I know the Mortification must be great on your Side too I mean  all of you  it is not an easie thing to bring Children off from their Levities and Pleasures which are become so Natural to them by a long uninterrupted Allowance of their Parents and Governours  nay  it is not easie for Children themselves to bring their Humours and Inclinations Fancies and Passions off from the Pleasures of Life which perhaps they have  as all mine have  had an unrestrain'd Enjoyment of  the Work is very hard  my dear  Dau  I believe it will not be half so hard  to me  to deny my self any or all of those Diversions and criminal Enjoyments you speak of  Mother  as to guide my self to those things which are necessary to be done or engag'd in  afterwards  Mo  My dear  a Religious Conversation is not the easiest thing in the World  Dau  But  I believe it is the pleasant'st thing in the World  Mother  Mo  Child  I wonder to hear thee say so for thou hast never seen any thing of it  at Home  Dau  'Tis true  I have not  at Home  but I have  abroad Madam  when you sent me to my Aunt's where you know I was Nine or Ten Weeks I thought I was in Heaven there  to what  I was at Home every thing  there  was  so  sober  so  pretty  so  grave  so  exact and  so  regular and yet  so  chearful  so  pleasant  so  innocently merry and  withal so  pious and  so  religious that I thought nothing so happy in my Life nor did I ever spend so many Weeks so well in my Life  Moth  Child  Your Aunt is a Dissenter you know  Dau  But Madam  My Uncle is a  Churchman  and let them be which they will  I see no difference  in their Conversation they all agree to be a religious sober pious  Family  The Children are all under such Government do all things  so prettily  and their Behaviour is  so agreeable  they love one another  so entirely  and enjoy one another  so perfectly  that I believe they are the Pattern of all the Town  My Ʋncle  every Night and Morning calls them all together to Prayers  My Aunt  takes all her Daughters together  once a Day  and makes one of them read a Chapter and then she says any thing she finds occasion to say to them by way of  Reproof  or  Direction  and I observ'd when I went  up Stairs at  Night  not one of my Cousins would go to  Bed till  they had retir'd into their Closets to their Prayers  by themselves  Mo  Poor Child  That was a strange way of Life  to thee  I believe  Dau  I thought it strange indeed  at first  but I was soon able to recollect my self and  was asham'd to let them know  that I thought it strange  much less  that I did not do so my self  Mo  Poor Child  If thou had'st been taught  as well as they  thou would'st have done so  too  Dau  Indeed Madam  as I was almost left alone I could not  but say my Prayers  too and this kind of Life began to be so pleasant and agreeable to me that I never enjoy'd my self  like it  in all my Life  Mo  And did'st thou not think thy Father's Family  a kind of Hell  when thou cam'st home again  my dear  Dau  No Madam  I confess it was odd  at first  when instead of a regular Family I came Home to all manner of Loosness and Liberty but it  soon began  to be Natural to me again and I forgot my good Aunt's Instructions  ay  and my Uncle's too who us'd to say a great many good things to me and give me a great deal of good Advice  Mo  How seldom is good Instruction lost or thrown away I am perswaded the little good Advice  they gave thee  was the Foundation of that Willingness to be govern'd and reform'd  which appears in thee now  my Blessing on her Heart for doing thee so much good  Dau  I believe it has done me no harm  Madam  Mo  How then  would good Instruction have wrought upon thee if  I had begun it  Ten or Twelve Year ago  Dau  Dear Mother  I hope it is not too late  Mo  Well  my dear  how do they spend  the Subbath  at your Aunt's  Not as we do  I dare say  Dau  No indeed Madam  after quite another Fashion The young Ladies are oblig'd to be down Stairs half an hour after Nine  in the Morning  ready dress'd then  my Ʋncle  calls to Prayers and soon after  they go all away  either to the Church or to the Meeting house but  whichsoever it is  they are  almost sure  to meet together after Sermon sometimes at the very door and then  Children  and  Servants  not one stirs from Home  In the Evening  my Uncle calls them  all together  reads to them in some good Book and then sings Psalms and goes to Prayers  when that is over  they go to Supper  then  they spend an Hour  perhaps or two  in the most innocent and the most pleasant Discourse and Conversation imaginable it is always about something Religious  and then  every one retires to their Appartments and the young Ladies spend their Time in their  Closet Devotions  till they go to Bed  The Sons  you know  Madam are grown up and those young Gentlemen are the very Picture of their Father sober virtuous religious and modest and yet are really Gentlemen and behave themselves as much like Gentlemen as any Men do  Dear Mother  when I came home  and heard  my Brother  damn  the Coachman and  curse  the Maids  when I heard  the Noise the Clamour the prophane Words that our Servants have in their daily Conversation  it amaz'd me  I thought at first all Gentlemen had been like my Brother but I was soon convinc'd when I had been a while at my  Aunt  's  Mo  All this  my dear  is the Consequence of the Difference of Education and all signifies  my  dear  that your Aunt has done  her duty  and I have not done  mine  nothing else has made the difference indeed God's Grace excepted  Dau  Dear Mother  do not afflict your self with what is past  sure  none of us will be such refractory Creatures as to resist  your good design  of reforming us now  Mo  O it's  too late  to bring your Brothers to any Government now  Mo  I hope not  Madam  if they are grown up and thereby may think themselves past Government yet  sure  they are not past Perswasion They may want Judgment  when little  and are then rather to be taught by Compulsion and Correction but as they are now Masters of more Reason  so  they will the sooner submit to the Affectionate Perswasions of a tender  Father  and  Mother  especially in a thing so apparently  and convincingly  for their own good  Soul  and  Body  Mo  I have a great deal of reason to fear the contrary  as well  in your  Sister  as in your  Brothers  Dau  I think  my Sister  is passionate and very fond of Pleasure  and Gayety  but  Madam  Time and your Authority  I hope  will prevail upon her to reflect upon her own  Interest  as well as  Duty  Mo  Go to her  my dear  and see if you can work any thing upon her  Dau  Alas Madam  I shall be a very simple Instructor  to her  who thinks her self so wise She reckons me  but a Child  fitter to come to School  to her  Mo  A less Child than you  my dear  has been my Instructor why may not you be  hers  Dau  I'll visit her  Madam  but I question whether she will speak to me for I know she is in a great Passion  Mr  Well go and bid her come down into the Parlour here's your  Father  a coming tell her your  Father  and  I  want to speak with her  Dau  Yes  Madam  She goes up to her Sister  THIS Dialogue chiefly discovers the Difference of Two Families One religiously Educated faithfully Instructed and Taught both by the Care and Example of the Heads of the Family the other abandon'd to the Gust of their own Inclinations and let loose in the Pursuit of their Pleasures without any Regard to their present Duty or future Happiness  The Benefit the young Lady receiv'd in the Religious Family of her Aunt and the Effects of it show us How pleasant a Religious Life when duly conform'd to and willingly comply'd with appears to be and What convincing Force it has in it even upon the Minds of those who have no Part in it themselves  End of the Fifth Dialogue  The Sixth DIALOGUE  WHILE the Mother was  thus  managing her Daughters the Father was as much engag'd with his  Two Sons  and his Hardships were  every jot  as great as the Mother's and his Encouragements the same too  It is to be observ'd here  that the Difficulty in this Part of Education of Children does not lie so much in the Question what to teach them and  what Principles  of the Christian Religion to go upon as to bring them by Reasoning and Argument to be  teachable  to perswade them that they have any Occasion to learn or that any are capable of teaching them and to cause them  to submit  to Instruction in general  The Father call'd his  Second Son  up to him on a Sabbath Day in the Morning before he came down Stairs and taking him into his Closet began this Dialogue with him The Son you are to suppose had been bred a Gentleman and a Scholar was about Seventeen Years of Age and was newly come from the University  The Father begins thus  Father  SON  I suppose you know what Day  this is  Son  Yes Sir  Fa  But perhaps you do not know  that not you only  but all the Family  my self not excepted  have never taken a due Notice of  the Sabbathday  or of the Manner in which we ought to behave on that Day The Duty appointed for the Day has been too much neglected above all the great Duty of setting it apart for the Worship and Service of God and keeping the  Sabbathday  Holy  Son  I remember  the fourth Commandment  Sir  Fa  Yes  We can all repeat the Commandments by rote and do every Day  at Church  say them over and over but the little Regard we have shown to them  in the Week  is too plain a Proof of our thinking but little of what we say for  God knows  in  my House  there has been little Difference between a  Sabbathday  and  another Day  unless it be that the  Sabbathday  has been spent the worst of the two for excepting our just going to the  Church  which also is made a meer Diversion and  a kind of  Entertainment  all the rest  is spent in meer revelling feasting visiting and either riding abroad or Mirth and Gayety at Home and this is so Notorious  more in my Family than in any other  that I am sensible it is  high time  to put a Stop to it and I design to tell you all my Mind this Evening that the Reformation may be effectual I hope none of my Children will oppose their own Good  Son  I hope not Sir  Fa  Nay if they oppose me  never so much  I am resolv'd of this if they will be foolish and wicked they shall be  foolish  and  wicked  for themselves not  for me  or for any body else  for my part  when I look back upon my Family and consider how we have liv'd hitherto I wonder that the Judgments of God have not distinguish'd  my Family  and made us as publick and as much the Amazement of the World for  our Punishment  as we have been Notorious for  our Sin  and therefore if it were only for the Fear of the Hand of Heaven  tho' I hope I act from another Principle too  I think it concerns me to set about a Family Reformation with all possible Diligence and Application  Son  Indeed I never consider'd it Sir  till of late  but for some time past I have begun to see we have not been right  It is true  we do not live as other Families do  and I have often thought so  but perhaps not with so much Concern as I should have done  Fa  Well Child  my Design of altering it will be so much the more agreeable to you  then  when you come to practise it  Son  If it were not Sir it shall be the more agreeable to me if it is your Command  Fa  I would not command any thing that should not be agrreable if it were not absolutely necessary but in things indispensibly our Duty the Humours of any Side are of no weight at all The Duty must be considered rather than the Inclination of those who are to perform it  Son  I am not only inclin'd to obey it  for its being your Command  Sir but my own Inclination concurs to set about any thing that will rectifie my Life and teach me to govern my self according to my Duty  Fa  What you say  Child  is very obliging  as it relates to me  and as I have always show'd you by my own Conduct in your Education that I have entertain'd a particular Affection to you more  than to the rest of your  Brothers  and  Sisters  so this Return is so  very pleasing  to me that I cannot but tell you I will not forget to shew it you and that I think my self very highly engag'd by it to distinguish you in my Affection and in my Concern for you as you have distinguish'd  your self  in your Duty and Regard to me on this Occasion but the Readiness you show to this Work of Reformation from an Inclination to the thing it self is a Particular which I rejoice in and  love you for  with an Affection which I was not Master of before But  tell me Child  whence came this Inclination How first came any Thoughts into your Mind about it  I am sure  I have never before spoken a Word about Religion to you in my Life  Son  I won't say so Sir  Fa  Ay  but I have too much Cause to  say so  and I am convinc'd I have not only fail'd of my Duty for which I heartily beg Pardon of Almighty God but have been injurious to you  Child  and to all my Children in not furnishing you with the Knowledge of your Duty when you were Young and giving you early Instruction  by which  much of the Follies of your Lives might have been prevented all the Time you have now mispent had been sav'd and you had all been long ago what now I doubt you will not obtain without great difficulty to me and your selves  Son  I am sorry to see you afflict your self  Sir  about that I hope it shall not be too late still  Fa  But  if not too late  the Work is double the Task hard the Attempt almost desperate and the Success very doubtful  Son  Dear Sir  You shall have no Difficulty  with me  I am entirely resolv'd to be guided by your Instructions to follow your Rules obey your Dictates and submit wholly to your Direction  let the Difficulty be what it will to me and therefore I only desire to know what  the first Steps  are you would have me take  Fa  The first Steps  my dear  are the breaking off the ill Practices of our Family and the regulating the House by the Rules of Virtue Sobriety and a Christian Life things we have all been Strangers to  here  Son  This Sir  is that which I told you before I had an Inclination to formerly and 'tis with a great deal of Pleasure I shall close with all your Schemes of that kind because it is some time ago since I have seen and observ'd that  as I thought  we did not live like Christians but rather like Heathens and that other Families were quite another Sort of People than we and I could not but be in love with them and weary of ours For  I cannot but think  that Nature it self dictates  to a Man of Sense  that a Life of Virtue and Sobriety is more agreeable to us  as Men  than a vicious wicked profligate Course which ever  not only  ruins the Estate the Conscience the Health and the good Name of the Person but even his Reputation  as to the World  also  Fa  I was asking you before what first rais'd these just Reflections in you  my Dear  for as I acknowledged then  I say again  I own thou art not beholding to me for them  Son  The first Hints I had of this kind Sir were a great while ago from some accidental Conversation with  Mr  our Neighbour when we were little Children  Fa  What the Old Gentleman  Son  No  the Young  and afterwards with his Mother when after our usual Recreations he carried me home to their House  Fa  How was it  Child  For I long to hear the Story If any good Person has  help'd me  to do my Work or  done it for me  I shall be very thankful  Son  No Sir  not much of that but when I first began to play with that young Gentleman  some Years ago  his Mother heard me use some  ugly Words  such as I was but too much given to then and sending her Son away  the Old Lady  took me into her Parlour and gave me Sweetmeats and ask'd me a great many Questions  Fa  What Questions  Son  She ask'd me  if ever I was taught  to swear  I answer'd  NO  She ask'd me if my Father would not chide me if he heard me swear  I told her NO  but I was sorry for it Sir  for I presently thought  that to say so reflected upon my Father whether it was true or no and that I ought to have said  Yes he did  tho' it was not true  Fa  Dear Child  The Sin was mine and the Shame of its being true ought to be mine and shall for ever be mine  I am glad  thou did'st not speak a false thing to her  What said she then  Son  She did not say much to me  the first time  but only she told me 'twas a sad thing that a pretty Boy  as she said I was  should be ruin'd and  I thought  I saw her weep  Fa  Did you see her again after that  Son  Yes Sir  She got me in again the  next Day  and gave me more  Sweat meats  and ask'd me several Questions about  God  and  Heaven  and I was sadly asham'd I could answer her  to nothing at all  for I knew nothing of it but what I had  heard by chance  or  learn'd by rote  She ask'd me if I was willing to know any thing for my own good in another World and I told her  Yes with all my Heart  She told me if I would come and visit  her Son  every Day she would use me like  her own Child  but she desired me to promise her one thing  before hand  I said  I would promise her any thing she pleased  then she said I must promise her not  to swear  nor take  God's Name in vain  She told me  that I  was  a Gentleman  and my Father and Mother were Persons of Distinction  that  it was not only a Sin against God but below me  as a Gentleman to swear  and  use ill Words that  if I should swear when I grew to be a Man  it would spoil all my Education  and no sober Man would keep me Company  that  if I would not leave off Swearing and taking God's Name in vain she must not let her Son play with me for she should be afraid her Son should learn such Words too  and then  he would be undone  Fa  And did you promise her  my dear  Son  Yes Sir  I promis'd her but I could not forbear crying and when I got away from her I could not help crying a great while by my self  Fa  What did you cry for when you  came away  Son  I cry'd  for shame  to think I should do any thing that wanted such a Reproof and  that  it should be counted scandalous or dangerous for any Children to be permitted to play with me  Fa  And did it not  make you angry  with the Lady that had reproved you and  hate her  Son  NO  Sir it made me  love her  and ever after that  to this Day  I have at several times gone to her and made her long Visits  Fa  And does she continue to talk to you so  Child  still  Son  Yes Sir  to this Hour  and calls me her Son and but that I would not dishonour my Mother I should call her Mother too  for she has been better than a Mother  to me  Fa  How did she go on with you  Son  When she had gain'd my Promise against Swearing she brought in all the wicked Words I had learn'd among our Servants and made me promise to  leave them all off  sometimes she would perswade me otherwhiles give me Money and other good things after that  she ask'd  if I used to pray to  God  I told her  I saidmy Prayers  But  my Dear  says she  do you know what Prayer means  I told her  yes  but gave her so weak an Account of it that she told me very affectionately  she would tell me  what Prayer was and after having explained the Meaning of it she gave me a few short Directions  what I should say  when I pray'd and then told me I ought to pray to God every Morning and Evening as the  Jews  offered up their  Morning  and  Evening Sacrifice  and that God expected such a Worship and after she had for two or three times talk'd so to me she made me kneel down by her and she stood up and prayed  a short time  over me  Fa  This blessed Woman what does my Family owe her  And what did'st thou think of it Child  Son  Truly it made my  very Heart  turn within me  when I heard  a Stranger so earnest in her Prayers to  God  for me who did not belong to her and some of her Expressions cut me to the Heart  Fa  What were they  Child  Son  I fear they will trouble you  Sir  if I mention them  Fa  Well let me hear them however  Son  She prayed  that God would supply the want of Instruction to that poor  neglected Child  and teach him by the powerful Influence of his Spirit  that  he would give the Knowledge of himself to me and reveal Christ in my Heart  that  being taught of God I might believe in him and believing  might have Life thro' his Name  She prayed  that  God would bless her Endeavours to instruct me tho' I were not committed to her Charge  and that I  might be convinc'd of Sin and then converted unto God  Fa  How canst thou remember all this  Son  It is written so deep in my Heart  dear Father  I can never forget it  while I live  Fa  What Effect had it upon you  Child  Son  Why Sir  the Effect was of many kinds  First I entirely left off all the ill Words I had used  according to my Promise  and I went about mighty pensive and sad for some time musing and considering  what my Condition was  that I was pray'd for as one  neglected  and  abandoned  and what she meant by the teaching of the Spirit and what by tue Work of Conviction and Conversion  and the like  Fa  And how were you informed  Son  I was then as impatient to be with her  every Day  as she was to have me and I continually harrass'd her  with Questions  and  Importunities  and she open'd and explain'd every thing to me in  such a manner  that I soon became able to understand the most difficult Points in Religion  Fa  And what Effect had it upon thee  Child  did'st thou not lose it all when thou cam'st home to thy Father's wicked Family  Son  No Sir  not at all  I began from that time  to read  the Scriptures  to pray  by my self and  to consider  to what Purpose  I was Born  and what was to befal me in a future State  Fa  And how long did this last Child  Son  I thank God it is not wrought out yet Sir  Fa  And is it possible  my dear Child  Has there been such a Thing  as a Child of mine  praying to God Has there been a Creature that has thoughta Word of Heaven and his Maker in my uninstructed Prayerless Family  Son  Little enough Sir  Fa  And how comes it to pass neither thy Brothers or Sisters ever heard of it and that I never heard of it  Son  I knew they would but  laugh at  me and  mock me  and think me a  Fool  and they have done so  as it is  when I would not go with them  to Plays  and to their  Sabbathday Rambles  Fa  Why  my Dear  was it  you  that refused to go I always thought they slighted you and did not care to take you with them and have been angry with them for it  Son  No Sir  they would always have had me with them but  I durst not go  I abhorr'd it  Fa  How cam'st thou to be against it  Son  My New Mother  always perswaded me against it told me the many Judgments of God that attended  Sabbathbreaking  and how many miserable Lives and Deaths took their Beginning at a Neglect of the  Sabbath day  She perswaded me too not to go  to Plays  and Balls and  bade me  if I wanted Diversion when my  Brothers  and  Sisters  were gone to  the PLAY  I should come and see her and that when my  Brothers  and  Sisters  went out to the Park or a Visiting on the  Lord'sday  I should come thither and see how they spent their Time or go up into my Chamber and pray to God  Fa  And did you do so  Son  Yes  Sir I went to her almost every  Sabbath day  Evening  Fa  What and no body know it  Son  No  every body thought I had Companions  of my own  to be merry with  Fa  And so thou had'st  blessed be God for casting thy Lot in such Company  when thy Father's House has been a Nest of Prophaneness and Abominations But how did they spend the  Sabbathday Child  when you were with them  Son  Very well Sir  for they are all good People before Supper they were all call'd down to Prayers Mr their Father read a Sermon and every one of the Children read a Chapter and then sung Psalms and then all kneel'd down to Prayers  Fa  And did you learn to pray  there  my Dear  Son  Yes Sir  Madam  my new Mother  us'd to take me and let me kneel down just in her Hand  as it were  and when there was any Word spoken that she thought I should remember particularly she would touch my Cheek and then after Prayer was over she would tell me  why she did so  and how that Sentence was proper for me to remember and to make use of for my self  Fa  She has been a Mother to thee indeed  A truer Mother than she that bore thee and has acted a truer Parent to thee than either thy Father or Mother ever did God that inclin'd her Heart  to pity my Children  double the Blessing of it  upon her own  I'll go and thank her for it and acknowledge how little I have done my Duty and how much of my Work  she has done for me  But  my dear  how long ago was this  Son  Eight or Nine Year  Sir  Fa  And how long did you do so  Son  All along  Sir  till you sent me to the University for a Year and a half and then I could not  you know  Fa  And have you been to give her Thanks for her Trouble  since you came home  Son  No indeed  Sir but I have e'en given her new Trouble for I go to her still every time I can get out not to be seen and as often as I can find her at Leisure  Fa  Still  my dear  Why what does she teach thee now  Son  O Sir  I find more Occasion of her  the more I go to her  she has taught me all the first Principles of Religion and I hope has put me in a way how to encrease and go forward  in Knowledge  and  Experience  Piety and Virtue till I come to be more able to instruct my self  without help  she is a most excellent Person and all her Family are like her  Fa  Indeed they are another kind of Family  than ours is  Well go on  my Dear  and the Lord that has found out an Instrument to do thee good  be himself thy Instructor  As for me  how I am ashamed  when I look into my own House and see what a Soil I have had to plant in and have neglected to cultivate it  what Children  would these have been if I had begun betimes to instruct them Well go  my Dear  it is late we will talk more of this another time  NOTE  the Father was so affected with the Circumstances which his Son had discover'd to him that he could not contain the Surprize but retir'd to give vent to his Passions he found that  God  had taken his Children  as it were  out of his Hand and had supplied the Defect of Instruction by good People in the Neighbourhood  as if  he had not been worthy to be  the Instrument  of their Good and this affected him deeply as will farther appear in the next Discourse between the  Husband and his Wife  when they come to talk about it  End of the Sixth Dialogue  The Seventh DIALOGUE  THE Father had not been so  happily surprized  in his Discourse with his Second Son  in the Morning  but he is as  unhappily mortified  with the Rencounter he meets with in his Eldest Son  in the Afternoon  The Young Gentleman was above Stairs  with his Eldest Sister  as noted in the Fourth Dialogue when his Father call'd for him and being a little ruffled in his Humour with the ill Usage  as he thought it  that his Mother had given his Sister he came down with a grave discompos'd Look and appear'd not very respectful in his Behaviour  His Father  who knew him to be  hot  and fiery in his Disposition was not willing to have been angry and design'd to treat him  as will appear  very kindly but he takes up the Case first and began with his Father  Son  SIR  did you forbid  Thomas  letting us have the Coach  Father  I ordered  in general  that none of the Servants should stir out to Day  Son  I thought so and  told the Dog  that I was sure you had not forbid him I'll break the Rascal's Head this Minute  Offers to go out  Fa  Hold  George  I must speak with you  first  Son  I'll come again Sir  immediately  Offers to go again  Fa  No no  I must speak with you  NOW  sit you down I'll have no body's Head broke to Day Don't you know it is  Sabbathday  Son  Better Day  better Deed  Sir It's never out of Season to correct a Rascal  Offers to go a third time  Fa  George  sit down I say and be easie perhaps you may be better satisfied  presently  if you can have Patience  Son  Sir  I am satisfied  from your own Mouth that the Villain not only refused when I order'd him to get the Coach out but told me  a Lie  and said you  forbid him  which I then told him I did not believe and promised to cane him if it were not true and I must be as good as my Word  Fa  Well well  but let it alone for the present  I say  Son  I must  and will  beat the Villain  by    Swears softly yet so that his Father overhears him  Fa  The Coachman's Usage is not  so rough to you  but I think yours is  as rude  to your Father  Son  Why Sir what do I say I don't speak disrespectfully to you Sir but I speak of this same Fellow  Fa  I heard what you said Sir  and what you might be sure I did not like and whereever you use  such Language  if you had any respect to your Father you would not take that Freedom  where I am  Son  If it had not been in respect to you Sir  why did I speak softly  Fa  That was  a seeming  Respect indeed but you took care I should not be ignorant  Son  I did not design  you should have heard  I intended no disrespect  Fa  Well sit down here then and suspend your foolish Passion about the Fellow at least for the present  Son  I suppose you don't keep Servants  on purpose  to affront me at that rate  Fa  If my Son had as much Patience  with his Father  as he obliges his Father to have  with him  he might have had an Answer to that  before now  but you are too hot for your Father to talk with you  it seems  Son  No Sir  I am not hot  but it wou'd provoke any body to be us'd so by a Servant  Fa  Then you must turn your Anger  this way  and quarrel with your Father for the Fellow has done nothing but what I commanded him  Son  Why  you said Sir  you did not bid him refuse me  Fa  You must have every thing nicely explain'd to you  it seems  I tell you what he said to you was the Natural Consequence of what I order'd  tho' perhaps  the Fellow did not give you the true Reason  but in general  I had bid him stay at home  Son  He might have said so then  Fa  No  perhaps I had commanded him otherwise too  Son  I find I am not to know  how it is  nor what it means  nor do I care  whether I do or no  Fa  In time you may  Son  As you please  Sir  Fa  Well in this it shall be as I please then but if you had  thought fit  to have come to talk with me with less Heat in your Temper and waited a little till I had spoke what I had to say to you all your Fury at him and your Indecency to me might have been spared  Son  I did not know what you  sent for me  for  Fa  And did not design to know it  I suppose  for you gave me no Time to speak  Son  I only told you of the Treatment of the  Coachman  I have no more to say  Fa  Then I may take my Turn I hope  I shall tell you then  that I send for you as I purpose to do for all your  Brothers  and  Sisters  to tell you  That  whereas we have liv'd in an open profess'd Contempt of  God's  Commands Prophanation of the  Sabbathday  and Omission of all Religious Duties  it is high time  to take up a New Course  that  I was convinc'd of what was my own Duty as a Father and a Master of a Family  that  hitherto the Sin lay too much at my Door but for the future I would discharge my self better  That  if my Children would go on it should no longer be through my Omission  but their own  To this Purpose I began with my Servants who as soon as I came from Church I commanded to be all at Home and that I would have no going abroad then I resolv'd to tell my Mind to my Children who  I expected  would not give me the Trouble of Commanding or using the Authority of a Father or Governour with them but that I might with Reason and Argument perswade and with Affection and Tenderness invite them  to a Thing  which must necessarily so far convince their Consciences as to leave them no room to question  but it was  infinitely for their Advantage and for their general Good both  Soul  and  Body  Son  I knew nothing of this Sir  Fa  Well  that's true  but  as I said  you might ha' known it before if you had had Patience or had thought fit to have given me time to speak to you  Son  Nay I do not understand it  now I do know it  Fa  Your Ignorance shall serve you but a short while you can easily understand this Part of it  that  without troubling you with any more of the Reasons of it I will have none that are under my Roof  Children  or  Servants  stir out of my Doors on the  Sabbathday  after Church is done  Son  You  will take it ill perhaps if your Children should ask you the Reason why they must be so confin'd and  your Children  will not fail to think it hard to be confin'd so  and not know the Reason of it  Fa  I might with much more Justice insist upon  my undoubted Right to govern my own Family  without giving an Account to my Children  of what I do  also in a Case so plain as this  methinks  they need not seek for a Reason for such an Order  but  since they pretend Ignorance  let them read  the Commands of God to keep holy the  Sabbathday  Son  Those Commands were as strong  before  as they are  now  and yet we never were thus confin'd before  Fa  The worst of that is mine  Son  and all that can be said for an Answer to that  is  That  BEFORE  I was to blame and neglected  my Duty NOW  I resolve God willing to do my Duty and neglect it  no longer  and if it be otherwise  they  that are guilty shall be to blame  not I  Son  Every body may do their  own Duty  for themselves  Fa  But it is my unquestioned Duty to make all that are under my Command  do their Duty  Son  I do not desire to be  confin'd  Fa  My Desire  or my Design  was not to  confine  you but to perswade you to  confine your self  by the Rules of your Christian Duty but you have  push'd it farther than I expected and if you will not do it your self I must do it for you  Son  I hate  to be confin'd  or to confine  my self  Fa  That makes it more my Duty  to confine you  and since I think your Business is to  obey  and not to  dispute  I desire no more of your Arguments but expect to see my Orders observ'd since I know they are founded upon both  Religion  and  Reason  Son  You may oblige us to  stay within  but you cannot oblige us to be  willing  Fa  Then I must be content with  as much  of your Obedience as  I can get  Son  And I hope will expect it  no longer  than while we cannot help it  Fa  But will  take Care  that you shall not help it  while  you call me  Father  for I will not bear  the Title  without the  Authority  Son  Liberty is a Native Right  the Brutes seek it  not a Bird will be in a Cage if it can be free  Fa  Liberty  to do Evil  is an abandon'd  Slavery  the worst of  Bondage  and Confinement  from doing Evil  is the only  true Liberty  But to cut this Discourse short I can give Liberty  no longer  to any under my Roof to break God's Commands or prophane his  Sabbath  it is not in my Power if you will not submit to  my Government  you must quit  my Dominions  and as I foresee you will be forward enough  to carry it high  you are mistaken if you think I shall wait to be told by you that you will  go abroad  or that you will  not stay  in the Family for unless you will submit to regulate your Life after a different manner than you have done and to receive Advice from your Father for your Conduct  flatter not your self  with your Father's Affection  I'll love  none that  hate God  nor shelter none of his Rebels my Doors shall be open to  let you out  when you please  Son  I care not how soon  Fa  That's what I expected from you  My Answer  shall be very plain you shall be at Liberty to go this Hour  Son  before the next but take this with you whenever  you go  that if ever you set your Foot  without  the Door on this Account you never get leave to set your Foot  within  it again but upon your Knees and with the humblest Repentance and Submission both to  God  and your  Father  for I am not in jest with you  Note  No wise Father ought to suffer himself to be threatned by his Children with going away from him but rather to make their being thrust from their Parents be the greatest Punishment they have to fear  The Father goes out of the Room but returns again immediately  Fa  I did not expect this Treatment at your Hands  Son  Son  I do not know what you would have me do  Fa  What I would have you do  is very plain  and is nothing but what your Duty  to God  requires  viz  To submit to the Regulations and Orders which  I shall give  in my Family  for  the Worship of God and  for  regulating our Morals and our way of Living  and especially  for restoring a General Face of Religion and Virtue upon our Conversation that we may according to the Scripture  live soberly righteously and godly in the present evil World  and not be eminent in the Place we live in for the loosest and most profligate Family in the whole Neighbourhood  Son  I think we are  Religious enough  what should we do more than we do  Fa  I think my first Work is to let you know what you should  not do  for if this cannot be obtain'd  viz  to refrain from what we do that is  Wrong  how shall we come to ascertain what is  Right  and if we know not what Evils  to refuse  how shall we know what Duties  to perform  Son  I know nothing  we do  that we ought to leave off  Fa  That is the Reason  why  I bewail so much your want of Instruction and Education and that I am so willing to retrieve the Loss I can soon tell you what you should leave off  viz  You should leave  prophaning the Lord's Day  in Sports Diversion Visiting riding to the Park Company  and the like  and spend it as it was appointed to be spent  viz IN Acts of Religious Worship IN  hearing and reading God's Word and  IN  other Duties proper to that Purpose  Next  you should leave off the  Play houses  and reading Plays as not only introductory to Vice and an extravagant Mispender of Time but as they lead to engaging in such Society and bad Company  as will  be destructive to any sober Character in the World  Thirdly  That  a general Sobriety  of Behaviour be fix'd upon the whole Scheme of your Conversation  free from  Passion ill Words Swearing blaspheming God's Name and from Drunkenness and all other Excesses These are  the main Heads  of the Negatives  which I speak of  and which I desire to be observ'd and this is  so  just  so  easie and  so  equitable that I cannot but expect  especially considering how many Children are Circumstanc'd  a ready Compliance with it I shall direct you to positive Duties afterwards  Son  I know not how we are  Circumstanc'd  or what you would have me understand by  that Word  Fa  I find your Temper  is such  that I am rather to let you know what I expect  than to hope  for your observing it and that you will put the Hardship  upon me of doing all with you  by force  This is a Treatment I think very disingenuous and unlike  a dutiful Son  I am willing to indulge you in every thing that is reasonable and just but as I am convinc'd what I desire is not only  your Duty  but  your Interest  to comply with I therefore cannot indulge you to your own Ruin and  for that Reason  if you will oblige me to use violent Methods to restore you and to restore my Family altho' I shall  be sorry for it  yet as it is my Duty  I must do it  and I let you know therefore  very plainly  my Resolution and the Reason of it if you can give better Reasons why you should not comply with these Things I am ready to hear them  Son  What signifies giving  Reasons  against what you resolve to do  Fa  It might take off the Scandal of Disobedience from you when you pretend to oppose your Practice to my Directions  Son  I don't concern my self about Scandals  not I  Fa  You fortifie your self against every thing a Wise Man ought to be concern'd at and that by a General Negligence of God and Man  as if  you were unconcern'd for Conscience or Reputation I hope you don't desire to be known by such a Character  Son  I don't see that I do  any thing  that deserves Reflection  Fa  Well come examine a little is your  Lord'sDay Conduct  to be justified Do you think you keep the  Sabbath day  as you ought to do  Son  Why Sir  do I not  go constantly to Church  Fa  Where do you find in God's Law that  going to Church  is the Sum of the SabbathDay  Duties If you can shew me that in the Scripture  then  I am put to Silence  Son  I see no harm in taking the Air a little  after Sermon time  Fa  If  Sermontime  be the whole of the  Sabbathday  you are in the Right but then you must prove that the Fourth Commandment should have been Translated thus  viz Remember that thou keep Holy THE SERMONTIME on the Sabbath Day  Son  I think there is no need of so much Strictness  Fa  God  and your  Father  are of another Opinion  or else  neither the Rules of One or the Discourse of the other are to be credited I see all your Arguments against these things are only  in general  that you do not think  thus  or you do not see  that  but have you any just Objections against the express Commands of God If you have let us hear them  Son  I do not object against the  Commands of God  but I do not see  on the other Hand  that I break the Commands of  God  in taking a Turn in the Park or visiting a Friend on a  Sunday after Sermon  Fa  I'll lock up all Argument on that Side  against you THƲs  If you can prove that taking your Pleasure on the  Sabbathday  is keeping it  holy  you may justifie your self  if not  you cannot and for that read this Text  Is    If thou turn away thy Foot from the Sabbath from doing thy Pleasure on my Holy Day  c There is the Word of God directly against you would you have any further Authority  Son  I cannot dispute of these Things  Fa  They that  cannot dispute  should not  contradict  however I think it my Duty to let all of  you know  that  as I have no reason to doubt but the Command of  God  is clear  and that  I ought to see it obey'd I join to it my own Command  viz That  in my Family I will have  no more  prophaning the  Lord's Day no more  going to Plays  no more  Swearing Drunkenness or Immorality whatsoever if I can help it and I expect to be put to as  little Trouble  as possible in having this order of mine submitted to  Son  I suppose you may find some Opposition  besides  what you think I shall make you have more Children than me  Fa  You have  the less need  to make my Task harder  and join  with them however I am speaking now not  of their Obedience  but  yours  Son  Perhaps I may obey  as much as they  but I suppose I may bear the Blame of their standing out  Fa  If you do well you are sure  to be accepted  if not  Sin lies at the Door  if you are an Encouragement to their Disobedience you take  your share  of the Guilt whether it be by Words or by Example My Business  however  is not  with them  now but  with you  and I desire to know  your  Mind having now told you  what I expect  Son  I know not what you would have me  say  you say you will be obey'd then  I must obey I think  I know nothing else to be said if you will make the House a Monastery I must turn  Monk  I think but nothing is more certain than that we shall all  think it hard  and think we are not us'd kindly  Fa  The Commands of God  are not grievous  nor are my Resolutions  hard  or unjust  and that  makes the Opposition  which you make  the more Unnatural  However  since you are not to be wrought upon to think it reasonable I must content my self to take your outward Compliance whether  willing  or  unwilling  though I think your  Behaviour highly disobliging and shall always let you know I resent it  as such  Son  You will find  ALL  your Children will think it hard as well as I  Fa  That cannot be true for I know  some of them  to whom God has given more Grace  Son  I am sure then  others  have not  Fa  Yes  I know your  Sister  has shown herself  much to the Disgrace of her good Breeding  as obstinate as your self and has been very insolent to her Mother and I hear she talks at a rate of her Mother that does not become her I shall assure her it shall not be born with  Son  I think  my Mother  us'd her very ill  Fa  I find you are  too partial  to be Judge of it  and therefore  ought to let it alone What has her Mother done to her  Son  She has taken away all her Books  of Value  and not only ruffled her with hard Words but even  struck her  with very little Provocation  Fa  You have a truer Account of the Fact I find  than of the Provocation  as to striking her I regret that she had not done it sooner and repeated it oftner her Sauciness to her Mother and her Contempt of God  were unsufferable  It was her good Fortune that I was not there and as to taking  her Books  I have had the Mortification to look them all over and with a great deal of Affliction  to think  that any Children of mine should spend their time in such foolish filthy and abominable Books  Son  What  do you mean the Plays  Fa  Yes I do mean the Plays Songs Novels and such like which made up her whole Study  were they fit for a young Maid's Contemplation  Son  I must own I think them very fit  Fa  Then your Sin is  come up  to a Maturity  very fit for a publick Reformation and it is high time you were begun with  wherefore I tell you very plainly  I shall cause you to pass the same Trial with your  Sister  and if I find any such like Books in your Custody  you may be sure  they shall all go the  same Way  Son  Then you will put me to the Expence of buying more for I cannot be without  my Plays  they are the Study of the most accomplish'd Gentlemen and no Man of Sense is without them  Fa  No Man of Vice you might say is without them but I am positive against Plays  as before  and I had rather have you not accomplish'd than that the other Inconveniencies  of Plays  should be your Lot but I can shew you many accomplish'd young Gentlemen who are no ways concern'd with them  Son  What who never see a Play  Fa  No never  Son  It is impossible  Fa  No no  far from impossible  Son  I can never promise not to go to  the Play  Fa  Then you and I shall differ to the greatest Extremity  Son  This is intollerable  I had as live you would turn me out of your Door I'll be content to go to the  West Indies  or be a  Foot Soldier  or any thing rather than be made such a Recluse Why was I not bred like a Priest Then you might ha' sent me to a Monastery and I might have been us'd to a  Cloyster Life  but to breed me up for a Gentleman and then confine me as no Gentleman is confin'd this is exposing me and making me look like a Fool among all Company  He flies out in a Rage  Fa  I had rather see you a  Foot Soldier  or any thing than listed in the Service of  the Devil  but  here is no need of these desperate Resolutions here is nothing requir'd of you  but what  becomes a  Gentleman  very well and as much a Gentleman  as any body  Can you pretend you cannot serve God and be  a Gentleman  That you cannot live a Virtuous Life and obey the Commands of God and yet be  a Gentleman  This is a Reproach upon the very Name of Quality and such a Slander on  a Gentleman  as no  Gentleman  in his Senses will allow However this  in short  is the Case  Son  and if confining you from unlawful Pleasures and from ruining your own Souls will make you desperate and you will be a  Foot Soldier  or run away to the  West Indies you must  I cannot help it I suppose you will be weary of it quickly  Son  I care not what I do or whither I go  He walks about in a great Passion  Fa  Unhappy foolish Youth Had I extorted Obedience to any unreasonable unjust Thing had I put you to any Hardships had I expos'd you to any Dangers or depriv'd you of your Lawful Pleasures  these Things  might ha' been alledged and you might have had some Pretence for talking thus  to your Father  but  all this  for laying before you your unquestionable Duty for requiring nothing of you but what your  Great Maker  commands nothing but what is  equal just  and  good  This is a deplorable Instance of the woful Depravity of your Judgment and Corruption of your Nature  However  tho' I heartily  pity  and  grieve for  you yet the thing I desire is so  just  so  reasonable  so  necessary  so much  my Duty  to command and  your Interest  to obey that I cannot I will not go from it or abate one Tittle of it  and therefore  you may consider of it and  act as you will  you know my Resolution and fall  back  fall  edge  I will have  it done so you may take your Choice for  God  or the  Devil  Father goes out and leaves him  Son  You may be as resolute as you will you will never bring me to your Beck What must I forsake all my Mirth and good Company and turn Hermit in my young Days  Not I  I'll go to the  Gallies  rather I'll seek my Fortune any where first not go to the Park nor see a Play be as demure as a Quaker and set up for a Saint what shall I look  swears aloud  likeI won't be a Mountebank Convert not I I hate Hypocrisie and Dissimulation I have too much Honour for it  Well  I'll go up to my  Sister  she is an honest resolute  Girl  if she will but stand to me  we will take our Fate together  What can  my Father  do Sure we are too big for his Correction we will never be made Fools on at this rate  The Father had sent for his Eldest Daughter and she had refus'd to come  as before  and the Servant had just brought word she would not come  Father returns  Fa  Will not come  Serv  She said she would not  indeed first  but  afterwards  she said she  could not  Sir  Fa  Go to her again  and tell her from me  if she does not come immediately I'll come and fetch her  Serv  Sir she was laid upon the Bed and said she was indispos'd and could not come  Fa  Well go back then  and tell her  her Mother and I will come to her  Serv  Indeed I told her that I thought you would do so  Fa  Well  and what said she  Serv  She said Sir  she was not fit to speak to you  I believe she is ill for she has been crying vehemently  Fa  I suppose you and she have conferr'd Notes  Son  I told you Sir you would have more Opposition to your Design than from me  Fa  Perhaps by your Means  Son  If that could be without my Knowledge something might be but I said before I should be tax'd with it whether guilty or no  Fa  I'll deal with it  let it be where it will  THE Son as soon as he could get away from his Father goes up to his Sister's Apartment it seems the Father tho' he had resolv'd to talk to his Daughter had deferr'd it for some time and did not go up to her Chamber presently  Being then in some Passion at his Son's behaviour and withal being preparing for the great Work which he had resolv'd to begin that Evening he was unwilling to discompose himself and make himself unfit for what was before him The rest of the Conduct both of the Son and Daughter and also the History of the Father's Management at his first beginning his Family Reformation will  ll be largely set down in the next Dialogue  End of the Seventh Dialogue  The Eighth DIALOGUE  BEING between the Eldest Son and Eldest Daughter her Brother going directly from his Father's discoursing him as in the last Dialogue up to his Sister's Chamber and calling at the Door begins thus  Brother  SIster  where are you  were you not sent for  by my Father  Sister  Three times in vain and ever shall be so till they shall treat me in a better manner or invite me by a more pleasing Message  Bro  But I bear all the weight of those Refusals my Father says they all lie at my door and angrily suggests that you are all made Rebels but by me  Sist  I know no Rebellion in it  I do not understand  what they would have  Bro  They would have you come down and be instructed  Sist  I sent them word  I was indispos'd  and they cannot but believe it when they know how they have us'd me besides I know their Business and desire no more of their Instruction  at least  of the kind they have already given me a Taste of  Bro  I have had a long Discourse of it with my Father  Sist  Well  And what  does the good Reformer  preach I suppose it is much the same with what I had from my Mother  Bro  Exactly  Kick and Cuff excepted  and truly tho' he kept his Hands  off  from me he has not spar'd abundance of Threatnings and other positive Testimonies of his Patriarchal Authority  Sist  Well  but what is the Sum of the Matter What is the Course we are to take  Bro  I know not  in the least  I have heard a great deal of Stuff of reforming the Family living after a new Fashion serving God  and I know not what  I wonder  who  my Father thinks we have been serving all this while  Sist  And does he not say we shall not  go out  a  Sundays  Bro  Ay  and a great deal more than that we must go to no more Plays or Opera's nor have any of the Plays brought home to read and a new Family Government is to be erected I don't know of what kind  Sist  Well  and when are we to begin When are we to be cloyster'd  for the first time  Won't he give us a Week to our selves before we begin  Bro  Not an Hour  Sist  Nay then  I shall break the first Commandment he gives me  for  I have made an Appointment  you know  to be at the Play to Morrow with my Lady  Lighthead  and it is impossible to put it off  Bro  Ay  and I will go too  or I shall think it very strange let him say what he pleases to it  Sist  I suppose I shall have another  slap o' th' Face  for it but I must venture it  for once  for I will not be worse than my Word to  my Lady  Bro  What do you talk of venturing it  ONCE  as if this was the last time and we were never to go to a Play again  Do you think  I will be abridg'd of so dear a Liberty  No not I  let my Father depend upon it tho' I never come into his Doors again  as he has threatned me  Sist  Very well  What did he threaten to turn you out of Doors  then  Bro  No  not directly  but I told him  I would be a  Foot Soldier  before I would be confin'd so and  in return  he told me if I went out in a huff  at this  I should never come in again  and a great deal more  such as that  Sist  Would I were a Man  as you are  if I was  I'd try him  what need you care whether you  come in again or no  You know you have an Estate left you by your Uncle which my Father cannot hinder you of you can live without him  I wish I could  Bro  Ay  that's true  but I suppose we shall not come that length  Sist  It may be not  with you  but I know not how far it may go  with me  for I hear  they  are mighty hot and angry with me  which I care little for  and am resolv'd they shall not conquer me  whatever comes of it  I suppose they think I cannot tell where to go or how to live without them  Bro  They may be mistaken  perhaps  in that too  Sist  Nay  tho' they were not mistaken in it I'll go as far as a pair of Shoes will carry me before I'll be made a  NƲN  of Nay  I'll go to Service first  Bro  You need not go far you have Friends enough you will be very well receiv'd at my Aunt 's House and if they push these things  to Extremities  I would ev'n have you go thither  Sist  And what will you do  where will you go  Bro  O I'll do well enough  I warrant you  I won't go for a  Foot Soldier  whatever I said to him I'll take me a Lodging at  Westminster  take my Pleasure and never trouble my Head with it  Sist  Agreed then  but shan't we go abroad  to Night  Shall we be baulk'd at this rate and let them think they have conquer'd us already  Bro  Why it's too late now  to go to the Park  my Lady  Lighthead  is gone to be sure besides we can't have the  Chariot  and there's no going in  a Hack  Sist  I'll tell you what we will do then  I am for putting the Case to a Tryal  and see what my Father will do when he thinks we have gone in spight of him and yet we will be able to come off of it too at last  if we find him furious  Bro  That's well contriv'd  if it can be done  but how will you go about it  Sist  I'll tell you  let  you  and  I  go out thro' tho' Garden and take a Walk in the Close behind under the  LimeTrees  when my Father calls for me  my Maid  shall say  we are gone to the Park  if he  bears it quietly  well and good we will let him remain in the Belief of it that it may serve another time if he flies out furiously we must  come in again with Good Words  and tell him where we have been and that we have not been any farther than the Close behind the Garden  Bro  Admirably well thought of  let us go immediately  for my Father and Mother both will be here with you presently and if you are not gone it will spoil all the Contrivance  They prepare to go down Stairs and the Young Lady talks thus with her Maid  M  stress  Pru  Maid  Madam  Mist  Here  take the Key of my Chamber and stay in it till somebody comes  to look for me  from my Mother  Maid  What Answer shall I give them  Madam  Mist  Tell them  my Brother and  I are gone out together  you may say you suppose we are gone  to the Park  Maid  Shall I say  Madam  that you said you were gone to the Park  Mist  No no  say you do not know whither we are gone but that you suppose we are gone thither  do not we use to go thither you Fool you  Maid  If they should be very inquisitive they may ask me  what Reason I have  to suppose so  Mist  Is not that a good Reason  for you to think so  because we used to go thither always on  Sunday Night without saying  that we told you so  Maid  Yes Madam  I think it is for indeed if you had said nothing to me I should have thought you had been gone thither  and ha' told them so  of my own Accord  Bro  This is a clear Thought  my Dear  but now we must do it  quickly  for I find we are to have a general Conference here  this Evening  and I suppose we that they call  CHILDREN  too are to be tutor'd before all the Servants  Mast  Pru  if you find my  Father  and  Mother  make a great Stir for us slip out  thro' the Garden  and perhaps you may find somebody at the  Back Gate  to tell you where we are and then you may come and bring us Intelligence  Maid  Yes  Madam  They go out together a back way thro' the Garden  Bro  Come  we are far enough here  They are walking under a Row of Trees just where the Father found his little Child in the first Dialogue  we are quite out of Sight of the House and  if your Maid comes  we shall see her at the  Garden Gate  well enough  Sist  Now  I cannot but laugh  to think  what a Fright my Mother will be in when she misses me  Bro  As bad  as if you were run away with a  Chaplain  Sist  She has not been without some Whims of that kind in her Head too  but she need not  I am not so fond of a preaching Husband  Bro  I doubt we shall discompose them for their new Devotion which they are setting up to Night  Sist  Pray  Brother  have you learnt  what they are to do  they treat me so odly they will have me comply with  I know not what  I want to know  what their Design is  and what they pretend we are  to do  or  to be  it is all a heap of Nonsense to me  Bro  O  they talk of a great FamilyReformation and we must submit to  such  Rules and  such  Orders as they shall  please  to give us and  as I told you  we Two were to be call'd down all together to be talk'd to among the rest of the Children  Sist  What are we to turn Babies again  and say our Catechise  Bro  I don't know  but my Father  as I hear  intends to make a long Discourse of his new Schemes for the Management of his Family to give them all new Rules and tell them what shall be the standing Orders of his House for the future  Sist  We ha' Preaching enough at Church  I hink  can't he let us alone at Home  Bro  I can't tell what to say to it  but he will do it  and ee'n let him go on in his own way let him make a School of his Family turn  Pedagogue  himself and make all his People School Boys let him but  let me alone  I care not what he does  Sist  Why that's what  I said before  the Servants are here  to Day  and gone  to Morrow  if he can't get a Parcel of Fools  this time  he may  another  and in time perhaps he may get a whole House full of good  pious  Creatures that will say  as he says  and do just as  he bids them  there's my Brother  Will  and pious  Betty  they are grown mighty good Things already and for the little Children they may make them do what they please but as  we are grown up  to be past it they may ev'n use the Rod and the Frown where it is fit to be used  and let us answer for our selves  I think they cannot in reason deny us this  Bro  Besides had they done this  gradually  and begun it  sooner  we might by degrees have been brought to ha'  liked it  or at least to have  born with it  but to be driven headlong into a thing of this kind and forc'd  at once  to a whole Change upon every Part of our Lives this is the foolishest thing  What shall we look like  in the World  Sist  What indeed  I am in a fine Case already  I can say nothing  to my Lady  Lighthead  but make a Lie and send her Word I was not well  Bro  Yes  you may say you are  but a Child  and your Mother box'd your Ears for being a naughty Girl and would not let you go abroad  Sist  Yes  And you may say to my Ld when he asks you why you disappointed him that  you are but under Government  and your Father would not let you stir out of Doors  Bro  To be sure  I shall affront all the Persons of Quality of my Acquaintance and shall look always  like  a Schoolboy  when I am in Company they will ask me  how I'scap'd out  if I have given my Governor  the Slip  and if I have  play'd Truant  When I am for breaking off at Night and not willing to stay they'll  mock me  and tell me I must go home to  FamilyDuty  and go say  my Prayers  like a good Boy  Sist  Yes  and that if you stay any longer  you shall be whipt  or lock'd out of Doors when you come home  Bro  In short  I had as good be out of the World  I am sure  I shall be fit for no Company in the World  Sist  I wonder my Father  should not consider  these Things he is no ignorant Man he knows well enough what belongs to being  genteel  and has kept as good Company himself as any body  Bro  Why  that is true too  but he is so bewitch'd with this  new Whimsie  of having neglected the Education of his Children and the Government of  his Family  that he is coming to Confession  even to us  he talks of asking God Forgiveness for it and I know not what  a deal of such Stuff  I am perswaded he will bring his whole Family into Confusion  Sist  I can't tell what to make of it all  it is the oddest thing  that ever I saw in my Life  Bro  However since he will do so  and we cannot help it  I think it may be our best way  to let him alone  let him  go on  only let him leave us out we are past Tutelage  out of our Minority  and I think they may let us alone that's all I am for asking of him  Sist  I wish they would but hear Reason  if they would let us alone  we would let their Reformation go on as it will  Bro  But I see it will not be done  my Father  is so over submissive in his Confessions and so warm in his Proceedings that I doubt he will also be obstinate  for nothing is more so  than these Enthusiastick Fits of Repentance  Sist  What a Tale is this  HE  repents and  WE  must perform the  Pennance for my Part Brother  I cannot entertain any settled Thoughts of the ridiculous Change of Life my Mother talk'd of there's not the least Consistency in it  she says  she has sinned in neglecting to instruct us  and therefore  we must all be cloyster'd up upon the Notion of Reformation if she has sinned she must repent of it I think what is that to us  We did not make her do it  what can we do in it We are brought up now she cannot educate us over again  Bro  Yes  she says we should have been taught  so  and  so  a long time ago  and since it was not done then  it must be done now  Sist  What will she teach us  Bro  Nay  do not ask me  I suppose  she told you herself what she would teach you  Sist  No  she did not  perhaps she intended it  but she flew out in a Rage and her Passion would not give her leave to say it out  Bro  She says she intended to have discours'd at large with you  quietly  and  calmly  but you provok'd her and would not give her time  for you began  Sist  Indeed  I was vex'd  that we might not go out  as we used to do  and I think it was Reason  but that was over  and I was only humming to my self the Tune of the last Opera and she flung to me and struck me because it was  Sabbathday forsooth  for my Part  I know no harm in it not I  I did not sing the Song out  as I told you  I only humm'd softly it might be a  Psalm Tune  for ought she knew  Bro  Well  but come  Sister  what shall we do next  Sist  We must take our Measures according as the Conduct of my Father and Mother shall direct  Bro  Yonder's  Pru  I warrant she brings some News  she stays  at the Garden Gate  Mistress goes towards her  Mist  Well  what is the matter  Pru  Maid  Matter Madam  I beseech you come in I sear my Master will go distracted and you'll all be ruin'd  Mist  Prethee don't tell me of that  let him be mad if he pleases  Did they ask for us  Tell me the Particulars  Maid  Ask for you  Madam  Yes you may be sure of it  Mist  Well how  Tell us all  Pru  Maid  Why  Madam  about half an Hour after you were gone your Mother sent Mrs  Betty  your Sister up to your Chamber  for you  she ask'd for me and I said  as you bid me  you were gone out she ask'd me whither I told her  I did not know  Why  said she  she is not gone to the Park  is she  I told her yes  Madam  I believe she is for I heard her speak of it  Mist  Well  that was right what said  Betty  Maid  Poor young Lady She fell out in the greatest Passion imaginable  weeping  and  crying out  for her dear Sister  meaning you  and that you were  lost  and  undone  both Soul and Body  Mist  Poor Child  What followed that Scene  Maid  She went down Stairs to your Mother and the  Old Lady  came up immediately and soon after her came your Father all into your Chamber  Mist  Very well  it works as I would have it now  What said they to you  Pru  Maid  First they examin'd me  where you was  then  when you went out  and  whether you were alone  or  your Brother with you  I told them I believ'd you were gone together but I was not sure nor you did not tell me whither you went  Mist  Well  that was right again  Pru  what said they then  Maid  Your Father made few Words  but it might easily be observ'd  they were both very angry  your Mother  said you would repent it and  I perceived Madam  tho' your Mother said most yet your Father seem'd most provok'd  he said  he would not discompose himself then about it for he had other Work before him but he would take a Course to prevent his being insulted at this Rate  and so  went down  Mist  And is that all  Pru  Maid  No no Madam  that is not all  I assure you  Mist  Well  go on then  Maid  Why  Madam  my Master call'd all the Family together and  Mist  What And made a long Preach to you all  did he  Maid  Dear Madam  do not mock at your Father  I am sure  there was not a Child nor a Servant in the House  but wept  and I am perswaded had you been there you could not have refrain'd  Mist  What  are you grown godly too  Pru  Bro  Nay Sister  come don't let us jeer them to the Servants  neither  Mist  Well but  Pru  come tell us the whole Matter  Maid  I cannot repeat Particulars  Madam  but when your Father had call'd us all in  the Minister  for my Master had sent for him on purpose  made a Discourse  for about half an Hour  about Familyworship and took his Text in  Jerem    Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that know thee not and upon the Families that call not on thy Name  Mist  Why then you have had a Sermon  Pru  What has my Father set up a MeetingHouse  Maid  Good Madam  do not let me tell you any more  it grieves me for you  to hear you make a Jest at good things and at your  own Father  too  Mist  Go on Mrs  Pert  you was not sent to  Preach too  was you  Maid  I wish you had heard  what I have heard  if you had had a Heart of Flint it would have moved you but my telling you will do no good  I fear  I wish you would excuse me  Madam  and if you love your own Welfare  I beseech you come in  there is  ONE STEP  left you to save all still  and but one  if you miss it  I am sure you are undone  Mist  Prethee  Pru  first tell us the History and give your Advice when you are ask'd for it  Maid  I will Madam  if you will have Patience with me  The Minister I told you made a Discourse about Familyworship and directed himself  chiefly to us Servants  he told us that our Master and Mistress being sensible that they had too long neglected the Instruction of their Children and Servants and omitted the Worship of God and setting up good Orders in the Family  were resolv'd  to alter the same and he desired the Servants to consider the Reasonableness of it and how much it would be our Advantage and that we would all yield a chearful Obedience to such Orders as should now be set up in the Family and to behave our selves soberly and modestly in the House avoiding loose prophane Talk  wicked Words Oaths Drunkenness  and the like  and if we were all willing and desirous to be thus reformed he desired we would signifie our Willingness  by standing up  Mist  And did you stand up  Pru  Maid  Yes  Madam  do you think I would not And every Servant in the House stood up too but  Thomas  the Coachman went farther than any of us  Mist  What did he do  Maid  He stood up and making a Bow  to the Minister  he said he agreed to it  with all his Heart  and he thank'd God that he had heard such a Proposal in the House and a great deal more that I can't remember  Bro  He is a hypocritical Rascal I owe him a Caneing for all this  Mist  Let us hear it all Brother  Well  and what then  Pru  Maid  Why Madam  after the Minister had done my Master  directing his Speech to the Minister  said he thought it his Duty to acknowledge  with Shame  that he had in a great Measure been the Ruin of his Family that he had totally neglected either the Worship of God in his House or the teaching and instructing his Children what he meant  by what followed  I cannot tell but he held your little Brother  Tommy  in his Hand and lifting up the Child and  kissing it  he said these Words  This little Creature has been the blessed Messenger from God to alarm me and convince me of the great Breach of my Paternal Duty and has innocently reproach'd me with not praying to God for it or with it and with not instructing it or teaching it to pray for its self  Then turning to us all and  said he  ye have all Cause to reproach me with it  as well as this Child  and more too for he is not too  old to receive Impressions yet  as I doubt some of you are  and  as appears by their Absence  my Eldest Children seem to be whose Ruin both Soul and Body lies at my Door  Mist  Did my Father say all this  Maid  Yes Madam and a great deal more that I cannot repeat  Mist  It was very moving  I confess  Maid  It was so  and that made me say  Madam  I wish you had heard it as I did  Mist  It is as well from thy Mouth  Pru  for I see thou art affected with it and so am I a little too I think in spight of my Resolutions to the contrary  Maid  How would you then  Madam  to have seen your Father  when he spoke of you two that were absent  How the Tears run down his Face and he was fain to stop speaking a good while do you think you could ha' contained I assure you  Madam  there was not a Servant in the House could refrain weeping  Mist  You almost perswade me to cry  Pru  but go on  Maid  When he had said this  Madam  he told us how he was resolv'd to live and that since  we had all  express'd our Readiness to comply with it he was very thankful that he should have so little Trouble  He told us  that all he expected was easie and reasonable and nothing but what every one would acknowledge was most suitable to the Happiness of us all as Men and Women as well as Christians that he required  nothing  uneasie  nothing  but that all manner of Vice might be retrain'd and a sober and well order'd Life might be our Rule  that  the  Sabbathday  might be strictly observ'd and  that  all his Servants should  attend FamilyPrayer which he resolv'd to have kept up every Night and Morning  After this the Minister went to Prayers and after the Minister  my Master  Madam  but had you heard him  Mist  What then  Pru  Maid  I would have gone a Mile on my bare Knees that you had heard him  Mist  Heard what  Pru  What should I have heard  Maid  You would have heard what you never heard in your Life  Mist  That's true  Pru  for I never heard him pray in my Life nor no body else I believe  Maid  Well  Madam  I wish you had heard it now  Mist  What was it That would have mov'd me so  Pru  Maid  Would it not have moved you  Madam  to hear your  dear Father  pray for you at the same time that you are grieving him as you do and beg of God to forgive you and reclaim you and to restore you to him that you might still be a Child to him and he may have an Opportunity to make up to you what Injury he had done you by his Neglect in your Education and that your Ruin may not be the Effect of his Omission Would not this have mov'd you  Madam  Mist  Truly  Pru  I cannot tell but it might  Maid  If the Words had not mov'd you it would have made some Impression on you to have seen the rest of the Family  Mist  What are they concern'd in it  Maid  Why  they are all concern'd for you two  Mist  For what  Pru  Maid  If you will not be displeas'd  Madam  Mist  No  Pru  speak freely  Maid  And if my Master will not be offended neither  Bro  No no  Pru  let us know it all and speak your Mind freely  Maid  Why really  Madam  they are concern'd on several Accounts to see such a Breach in the Family to see my Master so griev'd at it and yet to see him so resolute against you that they see plainly it will be the Ruin of you both and then to think upon how unjustifiable a Ground you act pray pardon me Madam it is not fit I should talk thus  Mist  Go on  Pru  Maid  Why  Madam  was it ever known that a young Gentleman and a young Lady the Eldest Branches of the Family should break all to pieces with their Father  and such a Father too  and on no Quarrel but that he would have them reform and serve God What will the World say I beseech you Madam consider of it all the House condemn you now and all the World will condemn you as soon as you are gone  Mist  Well  Pru  but we are not gone yet  Maid  I am afraid of it  Mist  Why so  Pru  I suppose that belongs to the latter Part of my Father's Discourse  Maid  Yes  Madam  Mist  Tell us that too  Pru  Maid  Why  that is it which gives me the greatest Concern for you  Madam  that when my Master had prayed so earnestly and so affectionately for your reclaiming and returning to your Duty  he went on to pray for himself  that he might not be suffered to yield to your Obstinacy that his Affection might not prevail over his Duty that if God in Judgment had resolv'd totally to cast you off he might be able to do so too and that in the  mean time he might be supported in maintaining his Resolution of not receiving you again but as Penitents and on good Assurance of your Reformation as well as Repentance and this Madam made me so earnest with you I think I shall break my Heart for you  The Maid weeps  Mist  Prethee don't grieve  Pru  but tell us what is to be done then What did you mean by talking of our coming in I don't see what we have done that we must repent so much  Maid  Why no Madam I hope not if you will but be prevail'd on now and that made me say there was one  STEP  left to save you still  Mist  I observ'd you said so  Pru  prethee good  Pru  What  Step  is that I did not think Things were come to such an Extremity with my Father  She seems to be concern'd and let's fall some Tears  Maid  Why  Madam  all this and more that I have not told you is upon a firm Belief which both your Father and Mother have that you are  both  gone to the Park as you know you bade me say  Mist  That's true  Maid  Now Madam if you will give me leave to go in and say you are both of you here and have been no farther perhaps this will alter the Case  Mist  You do not know my Father  Pru  he is not so soon alter'd  Maid  Perhaps Madam you may not know him neither  in this Case  Do you think if he reckons your Disobedience or Fault so much his Affliction he will not be glad to hear that you have not been guilty  Mist  Guilty of what  Pru  What is the Fault  Maid  Why Madam my Master believes that in Defiance of his Command and God's Command and on purpose to let him see you resolve not to regard what he has said to you  you are both gone to the Park  to take your Pleasure now on the SabbathDay and on this Supposition he has commanded when you come back  none of the Servants  shall dare let you in till they call him and that though he be gone to Bed he will be call'd up  Mist  Nay I knew if he was angry  he would be very warm  Maid  Now Madam here is a few Minutes left my Master may be convinc'd you have not been any farther than this Place and you may come in the same Way you went out and I dare say my Master will be glad of so just an Occasion not to be severe with you try him  Madam dear Madam  for your own sake do  you are quite undone  I am sure if you do not  Mist  He won't believe us now  Pru  Maid  I shall be a Witness for you Madam besides  your Brother there  is in his Gown and Slippers and that will prove he cannot have been at the Park  Bro  Ay ay he cannot but be satisfied  go  Pru  let it be so  we will follow you I would not push things too far neither  Sister  Sist  Indeed we have tried him far enough  for the first time  we'll go in after her then  Maid  If you please to be walking a little while I'll make you a Signal when to come nearer  Sist  Do so  Pru  we will come forward till we are in Sight if my Father continues very angry do you open my Chamber Window and then we will come into the Garden  Bro  Come let us go directly in after her  Sist  No no let us wait a little that will look as if she had fetch'd us  Bro  I can't think of provoking my Father too much neither  Sist  But let us get off  of this then  as well as we can  They continue walking  Pru  being come into the House makes as if she came down Stairs from her Mistress's Chamber  and meeting the Mother  she begins weeping  Pru  Oh Madam  I am undone 'Tis I have made all this Mischief  Moth  Why what's the matter  Pru  Pru  Why Madam  I told you I thought my Young Master and my Mistress were gone to the Park and that made my Master so angry with them both and 'tis nothing like it 'tis all my Fault  Mo  How do you know that  Pru  I should be glad for their own Sakes it was as you say and  so would their Father too  for though he is resolv'd to resent it as he ought to do being Master of his Family yet  as a tender Father  I am sure he would rejoice if it were not so  Pru  So Madam  Do but go up Stairs to our Window you may see them walking together in the back Close under the  LimeTrees  Mo  That may be  Pru  then they are come back  Pru  Nay Madam that is impossible too for my Young Master is in his Gown and Slippers and I dare say if you send up into his Chamber you will find his Cloaths there  Fa  What is that  Pru  says  Are they come back Has any  The Father comes  of my Servants let them in I  assure them I'll be as good as my Word if they have no such Servant shall stay another Day in my House  Mo  My Dear  be not too rash we are all mistaken come along with me look yonder they are and  Pru  says they have been there all this while  They go up Stairs and look out of the Window  Fa  I am not to be cheated this is a Feint they have their Intelligence within Doors and are come back and walk there to blind us but it will not do I will not be impos'd upon and I hope you will not neither  my Dear  Mo  No  my Dear  I will not be impos'd upon neither but if it be really so I believe you would be glad to be satisfied and would be agreeably disappointed  as well as I  for I know your Resentment is the Effect of your Duty and not the Defect of your Love to them  Fa  Indeed I would be so glad to know that they were not guilty I could let out some of my Blood to have it so but I can receive no Satisfaction in being impos'd upon I never believe a thing  meerly  because I would have it so  Mo  Nor I neither but  Pru  says they cannot have been farther for they are undrest and I am going to my Son's Chamber  to see  if it be so  Fa  Do so that may be some Satisfaction  Pru  throws open her Mistress's ChamberWindow and they see the Signal and come on to the Garden  Mo  The Thing is plain I hope for here is his Hat and Sword and Coat  The Mother returns  Fa  He may have come in and undress'd him  Mo  Somebody must ha' let him in then and you know we have had all the Servants in our View besides they would not have been so weak when  they had gotten in to have gone out again after hearing what Orders we had given and that Servant who had been so kind to have let them in would not fail to ha' told them of it  Fa  That is true  I begin to hope they have not been so wicked as I fear'd I'm sure I shall be very glad of it if it prove so  Mo  Look  they are coming into the Garden it does not look as if they were guilty I consess  Fa  I'll go and  try them  before they shall come within my Doors  for  not to keep Laws is all one as not to make them  They sit down together in the Garden the Father goes out to them  Fa  I desire a positive Answer to a plain Question from you both where you have been since you went out  They stand up perceiving their Father very angry  Son  We have been walking under the LimeTrees Sir  Fa  That I know  my Question implies  where else  Son  My Answer was so simple and plain I did not think it could have been suspected Sir and therefore I did not add tho' it is most true  we have been no where else  Fa  Your Conduct justifies the Suspicion why was no Servant acquainted with it that when you were call'd for might have answered for you  Son  That might be an Omission but could not be a Design  Fa  Why not a Design  Son  Because it seems to answer no End or at least that I know of  Fa  Perhaps you was willing to try me with a Belief of your being gone to the Park contrary to  my express Command I am not fond of being play'd with in such things as these  Son  It is a Sign to me  Sir  that you are very angry  at something  that you can suppose such a thing of me unless there were some great Satisfaction in your Displeasure it can be none to try whether you can be angry or no  Fa  I see no other End in your walking here so long  Son  You having expresly forbidden our going to the Park I could not but think our walking here ought to be taken for a Compliance with your Order  Fa  While you disputed the Reasonableness and Justice of my Order I had the more reason to suspect your Compliance  Son  But if I complied when I disputed the Justice of the Command it would more unanswerably argue an entire Obedience to it  as your Command only  Fa  I had rather you had obey'd it  as God's Command  than as mine and then you would no more have spent your time  here  than at the Park  Son  But if it be the first  Sir  your present Displeasure will remove if it was raised upon a Supposition of our having been at the Park  Fa  Your Absence on another Account has been offensive  Son  But cannot be justly charg'd as a Fault  Sir  for I had no Command except negative not to go to the Park which you will easily see is obey'd  Fa  I must suppose it  Son  Our Dress will be Evidence for us if your Suspicions are not to be satisfied by the Assurances  of one  who never prevaricated with you perhaps if I could have dissembled  more  as others have I might have been  less  suspected  Fa  You have much Advantage you think in not being guilty this time I should have been more glad to have seen your Inclination reform'd too  Son  I do not see my Inclination is vicious and am not a little surpriz'd at the Construction that is put upon my most Innocent Actions  Fa  And I do not see that what I expect is unreasonable and am as much concern'd to see my self contradicted by my eldest Son and Daughter in a Proposal to their good both for Soul and Body  Dau  I oppose nothing as I know of  Fa  And comply with nothing  Son  We had no Command from you to stay within  Fa  I demand of you both whether you have been in no Company or any where else than  as you say  walking under the LimeTrees and I expect to be answer'd without the least Prevarication  Son  You may be assur'd Sir we have been no where else  Fa  I am glad for your own Sakes for the Measures I had resolved to take would have been very irksome to me tho' absolutely necessary  I shall say no more now  it is on the Condition only that your Answer is literally true that I can admit you to come into my Doors I shall state your Duty more exactly to you in the Morning and perhaps too exactly expect your Compliance  The Father goes away  Sist  I never saw my Father look so in my Life  I am frighted  Bro  He convinces me he is in earnest after a manner I never expected It falls out very well that we contriv'd this Shift we should have made such a Breach as would never have been reconcil'd  I'll carry the Jest no farther  Sist  What must we do then I cannot think of being a Nun and being abridg'd of those Liberties and Pleasures I always enjoy'd Why did they not bring us up to it from Children then it had been Natural to us and we had known no better  Bro  I'll tell you  Sister  what I'll do my Father promis'd me I should Travel I'll see if I can get leave to go abroad then I shall be a little out of Company and shall not look so like a Fool under Government  as I must do now  Sist  And what must I do  Bro  Ask their Consent to go and live at your Aunt's as we said before  Sist  So I will then  Thy go in and go up Stairs and in the Chamber they meet the Maid  Bro  Well  Pru  how stands Matters  Maid  I'm glad you're come in  Sir  I trembled for fear you should quarrel when I saw my Master go to you for he was in a great Passion and declar'd when he went out to you that if he was not very well satisfied that you had been no farther than the  LimeTrees  you should not come within the Doors  End of the Eighth Dialogue  A short Discourse between the Husband and Wife which finishes the History of the Conduct of their Children  Husband  MY Dear  we have had a hard Day's Work but I hope it will issue well  Wife  Alas How easily had all this been prevented if we had begun well and how great Advantage have they who begin their FamilyWork when they begin to have Families  Husb  I have eased my Heart in the publick Acknowledgment I have made of that Omission and I hope we shall testifie our sincere Repentance for that Sin by our exact observing our Duty in time to come  Wife  But the Difficulty of our Two Eldest Children I doubt will every Day renew our Affliction  Husb  I must take it for  a just Punishment  upon my past Neglect but I will not  for that  cease to go through with my Work  I will not cease  to pray for their reducing  NOR  to use my Endeavour as well by Perswasion as by Severity to oblige them to a Reformed Life and I have a full Dependence upon God's Goodness that he will restore them  both  to me  yet  tho' they may stand out a great while and  this hope  preserves my Resolution to omit nothing that may reclaim them  Wife  I see them both so wedded to their Pleasures that they think it a most intolerable Burden to be abridg'd of them and I find my Daughter sullen and melancholly upon it she tells me she cannot appear among Company and she is asham'd to be seen and desires me to let her go to her Aunt's and live with her a while  Husb  By all means  let her go  I think it a Step of that Providence to reclaim her that I was telling you  I hope in  for my Sister will allow her or encourage her in none of her Levity  I am sure of that  and my Brother keeps just such an Orderly House as I ought to have kept and hope to keep for the future  Wife  Indeed I am very willing to it for her Sister owns to me she receiv'd the first Impressions of Religion and serious Thoughtfulness  at her Aunt's I'll e'en send her away  Husb  But what shall we do with  your Son  For I have a secret Hint given me to Day that he designs to ask me leave to travel and pretends that I promised him  Wife  Yes  and I have been told that if you refuse him he will go without your Consent depending upon his own Estate  Husb  I shall be more willing to let him go now  than ever  because as I would have no Obstruction to the Resolution I have taken to reform my Family so I would be very sorry to see him expose his Reputation so much as to contradict me in it  and appear obstinate in doing so  which must embroil me with him for I shall not yield to my Son especially where I am sure he is in the wrong and indeed his Carriage hitherto has been a very great Affliction to me if he proves impertinent I shall be oblig'd to resent it Therefore I shall only put in one Condition if he asks me  viz  That he take Mr  B  for his Tutor to travel with him and he shall go when he will  Wife  That I dare say he will not do  Husb  Then he goes without my Blessing or Consent  The Daughter is sent to her Aunt's where having a sober religious Family to converse with she begins to be less fond of her old Humours and a Foundation is laid there in her by the Instruction and Example of her Aunt and her Children which ends at last in her compleat Reformation by marrying one of her Cousins a sober religious Gentleman  The Son travels without his Father's Consent spends his Estate gets a Commission in the Army is disbanded comes Home a Cripple and a Beggar and tho' always very penitent for rejecting his Father's Government and Instruction yet never submits himself to his Father so as to be receiv'd again and dies miserable as will be seen in the last Part of this Work  End of the First Part  PART II  The INTRODƲCTION  THE First Part having historically treated of a Father's Conduct with his Houshold the Foundation of his Resolution to reform his Family instruct his Children  c  I hope it may afford suitable Lessons to Fathers Mothers Masters of Families  c  in their Duty of FamilyInstruction as also Examples and suitable Hints to Children to warn them against despising and contemning the Instruction of their Parents from the Consequences on either Side which appear in the foregoing History of this unhappy yet happy Family  The ensuing Part will go the same Length in the following Cases  viz  Masters to Servants Servants to Masters and to FellowServants Companions and Sociates one to another from all which may be learnt some Lessons to instruct us how to fill up every Relation every Occasion every Circumstance of Life and every Conversation with something useful and instructing to one another  The Scene lies now among the meaner Sort of People where the Value of a Religious Family the Extent of its Influence and the Advantage of good  FamilyGovernment  as well to those who are  out as to those who are in the Family may be particularly observ'd from the remarkable Conduct of some Persons belonging to Two or Three Families in a certain known CountryCorporation at some Distance from  London  THERE liv'd in a Country Town an industrious Trading Man in middling Circumstances whose Employment being a Clothier caus'd him to take several Apprentices and several Journeymen and who had also several Children of his own He was a Man of an exact upright Conversation of a most devout and religious Behaviour but more especially in his Family one that constantly maintain'd the Exercise of Religious Worship in his House instructing and educating his Children and Servants in the Fear and Knowledge of God with great Care and Regard  as well  to their Good  as  to his own Duty and this with all possible Modesty and Caution avoiding all hypocritical Shews and Appearances of Ostentation being a serious useful Christian in every Respect and his Wife was in her Place every way like him  There was in the same Town a wealthy Shopkeeper a Man in great Business a Magistrate or Alderman of the Corporation who had likewise a large Family of Children and Servants The Man was bred to business drove a great Trade and grew Rich apace he was an honest sober Man had the Reputation of a very fair Dealer the Credit of what we call a good Man that would do no body any Wrong but as to Religion he made no great Stir about that he served God  a Sundays  as other People did and troubled his Head very little with any thing that was Religious all the Week after indeed he liv'd in  a constant hurry of Business so that he had really no time to think of or to spare about Religious Affairs  His Children as they grew up he put honestly to School enquir'd sometimes superficially if they were good Boys and learn'd their Books and the Master as superficially giving an Answer that they did pretty well he was mighty easie as to their doing well in the World  As to his Servants it was none of his Care in the least what they did so they minded his Business as to Idleness he took pretty good Care to prevent that by finding them constant Employment in his Ware houses and about his Business and as to either their Morals or Religion he counted it none of his Business except at any time some gross Indecency came in his Way which oblig'd him to find Fault and then his Displeasure respected the Neglect or Obstruction of his Business or some Complaints or Uneasiness in the Neighbourhood rather than any thing of Religion  It appears by the Story in hand that two young Lads much about the same Age and pretty near the same time came Apprentices to these Two Men The Youths were very different in their Behaviour tho' otherwise agreeable to one another their Conduct was  as in such Cases it will be  suitable to the Families of their Parents with whom they had been Educated  the one  a sober well inclin'd serious Lad that had been brought up by Religious Parents well instructed and formed early to desire the best things  the other  a loose profligate prophane Boy perfectly wild that had been taught nothing and desir'd to learn nothing  but his Trade  given to swearing lying and ill Words but of a good Capacity  enough to learn if he had been taught in time so that he was meerly lost for want of early Instruction  The sober religious Lad was unhappily put Apprentice to the Rich Shopkeeper who regarded no Religion but his Trade and the wild prophane Boy was put Apprentice to the Religious Tradesman the Clothier and being Neighbours the Boys became acquainted it seems Altho' there was very little Suitableness between the manner of the young Men's Education yet their Age Neighbourhood and Opportunity of Conversation concurring and other Circumstances perhaps in their Temper or in the time of their coming to their Masters making them more agreeable to one another than ordinary they became Companions and contracted an intimate Friendship the Consequence of which will appear in the following Dialogues  The First DIALOGUE  AFTER as is noted the Two Youths had contracted an Intimacy so that it was grown up to a kind of Affection between them they agreed in the first Place to call Brothers  and then  that every Evening when their Shops were shut up and their Business over they would spend any Time they had to spare always together either at their Masters Doors or walking or as their Liberty would permit and  as may be supposed to be pretty usual in such Cases  it was not the last of the Questions they asked one another at these Meetings how they lik'd their Masters their Employments their Usage  and the like  In these Discourses it fell out they wanted no Grievances to complain of on both Sides for that neither of them tho' they had both gone so far as to be bound lik'd their Circumstances but it seem'd that the greatest of their Dislike was at their Masters and the respective Management of their Families rather than at any thing in the Trades they carried on which they otherwise lik'd well enough  Says  Will  who liv'd with the good Clothier I'll tell you plainly Brother  Tom  I am quite  tir'd out with my Master I can't imagine what my Father meant when he pick'd out such a Man for me I'm sure my Father is none of those kind of People himself Why our House is a Monastery instead of a Shop or a Work house  A Monastery  Will  says the other what  do you mean by that  Don't we hear your People and your Servants about their Business every Day they don't dress Cloth and comb Wool in the Monasteries  Why no Brother  says  Will  it is not a Monastery so I don't mean  that  but we have such a World of Ceremonies and Religious Doings among us 'tis enough to weary a Body off their Legs I'm sure I shall never endure it long  Tho  Perhaps you are sooner tired with these Religious Doings Brother that you speak of than you would be with other things Is not that it Brother  Will  speak honestly  Will  Nay I do not know much about it I confess it don't signifie much I suppose but to torment us  Tho  Nor do you mind it much I suppose when you are at it  Brother  do ye  Will  No indeed not I I take care to get a good Sleep all the while if I can  Tho  Fie upon you  Will  Will  Why what does it signifie to me  Tho  What their Prayers  Brother  Will  Ay their Prayers why they pray for themselves not for me do they  Tho  No doubt they pray for you too  Will  I don't care whether they do or no  Tho  Nay there I think you are wrong  Brother Will  should we not be glad to have any body pray for us I remember at Church there are Bills sent in for the Minister to pray for Folks  they would not put up Bills to be pray'd for if it was of no Signification  Will  Ay  that's when they are sick  Brother  but what's that to me I am well enough and it is but when they desire it now I never desir'd them to pray for me what need they trouble their Heads about me in their Prayers  Tho  Well  but  Brother  you say they pray for themselves why should you be against that  Will  Not I but then they may do it by themselves  can't they  What need they keep us up at Night and raise us up in the Morning Can't they let us alone we work hard enough all Day they ought to let us sleep at Night sure  Tho  Why do they take up so long Time at it  Will  Ay  I think it is long  for us that work hard at our Business all Day  here we are haul'd out of our Beds every Morning by Six a Clock to come to Prayers before we open the Shop or go into the Workhouse  and at Night  we are kept up I know not how long to read and go to Prayers when we might be all a bed and asleep I tell you 'tis a meer Monastery I cannot endure it  Tho  Well  but  Brother  I remember one thing by the By it seems this can't be much Trouble to you for you acknowledge you sleep all the while if you can so that you do not lose much of your Rest  Will  Ay that's true  but that can't be always besides every now and then they catch me at it and then there is such a Noise with themThen there's our Master's Son he is such a Religious Monkey he is always a jogging a Body that I can't get a good sleep for him but this is not all  Brother  we have abundance of strange Doings of this kind besides going to Prayers  Tho  But hark you  Brother Will  about calling you up in a Morning let me hear that again you say your Master calls you up by Six a Clock in the Morning to come to Prayers  Will  Yes and that is I say just as they do in the Monasteries  I know 'tis so  for I had a Cousin that was a Nun and made her Escape out of a Nunnery and she is turn'd Protestant and she used to tell me they were obliged to rise at such Hours in the Night to go to Prayers I wonder my Master don't do so too I don't question but in a little time he will and we shall be all Monks instead of Clothiers  Tho  But  Brother Will  you must do your Master Justice now for if I mistake not you wrong him very much by your own Account  as I was going to say  Will  How  Brother  I don't wrong him at all  Tho  Why  you suppose of him he takes the Time he spends in those Religious Things out of your Sleep or out of the Time when you ought to be in Bed and you think that an Injury to you because you work hard pray what time do your hir'd Journey men come to work in a Morning  Will  At Six a Clock  Tho  Well  and do they actually go to work by Six a Clock  Will  Yes why not  is not that the usual time  Tho  Yes  Brother  but then you say your Master does not call you up till Six and then he goes to Prayers now if he did not go to Prayers he would go to work and you could not expect but to be at Work who are his Apprentices as well as the Journeymen so that the Time he spends at Prayer he takes out of your Working Time and not out of your Sleeping  Time and the Loss is his own not yours I think there you do your Master wrong  Brother  Will  What care I whose Time it is I wonder what need there is for making such a Pother I am as tir'd as a Dog with it I warrant they don't do so at your House  Tom  Our House  Will  No indeed we are not troubled with it I never heard a Chapter read or a Word spoke of Prayer since I came into the House and that's as much my Uneasiness as this is yours  Will  You are very happy  Brother  I wish I had been in such a Place  Tho  I cannot be of your Mind  Brother  what makes you talk so wickedly  Will  What do you mean by wickedly I say you are happy that you are not tormented as I am  Tho  I Ay  Will  but at the same time all this that torments you is your Master calls you up in the Morning and keeps you up at Night to do your Duty and what you ought to love I mean to go to Prayers  and the like  Will  Why ay  Is not that Torment enough What do you tell me of their Prayers and Duty I desire none of it not I  Tho  You make me tremble  Will  I am frighted at you  Will  Frighted at what  Tho  Why if I should talk as you do I shou'd be afraid the Devil would take me away alive Do you know what you are talking of  Will  Yes sure  I speak plain enough  Tho  Why is not all you complain of nothing but serving God as they are commanded to do and are we not all to do so too if we would be sav'd  Will  Prethee  Thomas  don't thou talk Gospel too I ben't against their serving God not I  Tho  But you a'n't for doing it your self tho' and you speak contemptibly of the Thing it self  Will  I don't know what belongs to it not I what need they make such a do about it  Tho  About what  Will  what about serving God  Will  No  about their saying so many Prayers  Tho  You are mighty uneasie methinks about saying your Prayers is not that serving God I am amaz'd at you indeed  Will  Will  Why but as I told you  Brother  that is not all  Tho  No is not that all What then  Will  No nor half for every Night in the Week we must read every one a Chapter and there our Master tells us a long Story of something or other about what we read and asks us a great many foolish Questions that I can give no Answer to then every Sunday we are examin'd about what the Minister said at Church I never heard of such blind Doings  why  how should I remember what he says it may be I am at Play without Doors or in the Churchyard half the time  Tho  Well but  Brother  you should not you ought not to do so  you know that  I hope and I suppose your Master puts you to remember what the Minister says that you may be oblig'd to stay and hear him as you should do I think he is very kind to you I wish I had such a Master  Will  Will  I don't value such Kindness let him be kind to me in other things  Tho  Why can any thing be kinder than to keep you from doing what you should not do I  mean playing in the Fields or Streets or Churchyard all Sermon time  Will  Yes I would fain have him let me go Home every  Sunday  to my Father's that would be kind to me but he won't let me do that  Tho  Brother  that would not mend the matter to be sure your Father would take care you should go to Church all the Day and go to Prayers again at Night and you say you can't abide that  Will  You are quite mistaken in my Father he is none of them he goes to Church himself indeed but he never troubles himself to hinder us we may go where we will for all him if he would but let me go home to my Father I should do well enough  Tho  Well  nor don't your Father call you to Prayers at Night  Will  No indeed nothing like it he knows better things  Tho  What nor a  Sunday  Night neither  Will  No nor a  Sunday  Night neither Prayers I dare say no body ever heard my Father say any Prayers in his Life except when his Horse fell on him and broke his Thigh and every body thought he would ha' died or must have had his Thigh cut off then he sent for the Minister indeed and they had a deal of Prayers in the Chamber I remember but as soon as that was over and my Father was well again he never troubled his Head any more with it what shou'd he for there was no need of it then you know  Tho  For the Lord's sake  Will  do not talk so  Thomas  starts as if he was frighted  Will  What do you mean What do I talk  Tho  Talk Why you talk Blasphemy almost you have been dreadfully Educated  Will  prethee  what is your Father Is he a Protestant  Will  Talk Blasphemy What do you mean  Tom  What did I say  Tom  Say Why I am afraid to repeat what you said  Tom  looks earnestly upon him and upon the Ground about him  Will  What makes you look at me so  Brother  you look as if you were scared what ails you  Tom  Truly  Will  you have terrified me I was looking at you to see if you did not begin to look pale and stagger for I wondred God did not strike you dead when you talk'd so horridly  Will  And what did you look about upon the Ground for  Tho  To see whether it did not begin to cleave and part for I expect every Moment it should open and swallow you up  Will  You Fool you what do you mean  Tho  Indeed I should have expected all that if I had said so  Mark the Tenderness of the Child that was Religiously Educated  Will  What did I say that you make such a stir about it  Tho  Truly  Will  I wish you would consider a little your self what you said or at least what you meant when you said your Father knew better than to pray to God and that after your Father had broke his Thigh and was well again there was no need of praying to God Are not these dreadful Words  Will  Will  No I think not what Harm is there in them I thought no Harm not I  Tho  But are you in earnest  Will  when you say your Father never prays to God  Will  Nay  Tom  I did not say never I told you he went to Church a  Sundays  Tho  Well but never else never at home never call'd his Family to Prayer as your Master you say does  Will  No never in his Life that ever I heard of  Tho  Why what is your Father Is he a Heathen or a Christian Is he a Papist or a Protestant  Will  My Father a Heathen No I think not he is as good a Christian as any of our Neighbours  Tho  Ay That's strange I thought there had been no Christians liv'd so  Will  Is he a Protestant or a Papist  Will  Why a Protestant what should he be do you think my Father a  Papist  No indeed my Father's as good a Protestant as any of you did not I tell you he went to Church every  Sunday  nay sometimes  especially when it is bad Weather  he goes to the Meetinghouse because the Church is a good way off  Tho  Will Will  I never heard the like or saw the like till I came to my Master I thank God I have never been bred up among such Christians or among such Protestants I thought there had been no such Protestants in the World nay there is a Popish Family lives next Door to my Father's and they are constantly Morning and Evening and often at other times of the Day too at their Worship and Prayers serving God in their Way nay I have heard that the  Turks  say their Prayers Five Times a Day Why it is natural to pray to God  Will did not he make us  Will  I can't dispute not I what do you call serving God Is not going to Church serving  God I told you my Father went every  Sunday  to Church I think that's serving God isn't it And he may say his Prayers at home too for ought I know I suppose he does not tell Folks when he does that as my Master does who makes all the House hear of it  Tho  But Brother Will  thou talk'st as if thou had'st been bred a Heathen and not a Protestant Prethee  Will  did'st every read the Bible  Will  Yes I learnt to read in it at School  Tho  Was that all Did you never read at Home What have you never a Bible in the House  Will  Yes we have a great Bible in the Parlour Window  Tho  What and does no body use it  Will  Yes my Mother reads in it sometimes and my Father sets down how old his Children are in it there's the Time when we were all Born  Tho  But were you never us'd to be bid to read in it by your Father or Mother  Will  Yes my Mother would sometimes call me from Play to come and read my Book but I would not come I lov'd my Play too well for that  Tho  What would not you come  Will  No not I  Tho  What not when your Mother call'd you  Will  Mother no what car'd I for my Mother  Tho  I never heard the like in my Life why 'tis a Sign you never read the Bible  Will  Why what if I had  Tho  Why there you would have read  Cursed be he that sets Light by his Father or Mother  Deut Besides  Will  cannot you say the Ten Commandments  Will  Yes I think I can  Tho  Well and don't you remember the Fifth Commandment  Honour thy Father and thy Mother  Will  Why what's that to my going to Play  Tho  But it was something to your refusing to come and read your Book when your Mother call'd you  Will  What signified that I knew my Mother was not angry she did not much trouble her Head whether I came in to read or no  Tho  So indeed it is plain as you said that neither your Father or your Mother troubled their Heads about you whether you served God or no I do not wonder that you think it so troublesome that your Master goes to Prayers and serves God in his Family I wonder how you that have been bred so wickedly came to be put out to so religious a Family as your Master is  Will  Why I heard my Father say once before I came to my Master that he was the willinger to put me to him because he was a good Man and I might learn good Things there for I had never learnt any at home  Tho  So that your Father owns then  Will  that these are good Things tho' he does not practise them himself that is very strange  Will  Will  Yes yes  My Father us'd to say he lov'd my Master because he was a good Man and that he was a Man kept good Orders in his Family and one Day he told me that if I was a good Boy and follow'd my Master's Advice I should be made a good Man better than ever my Father was and that my Master went to Prayers and served God and such as that but I knew nothing what he meant if I had known how it was I should never have come  Tho  Why you own that tho' your Father did not call you to Prayer himself he lik'd your Master the better because he did why should not you too  Will  Not I I lov'd to live as I had been bred  Tho  But you see your Father own'd that your Master was a better Christian than himself and that the Orders he kept in his Family was the way to make you a good Man nay to make you better than your Father too methinks you should believe your Father  Will  I don't know as to that but I don't like it not I  Tho  You are then not for being made a good Man or else you don't believe your Father  Will  I don't see how he'll make me any better than I am I tell you I don't like it at all I dare say you would not like it neither  Tho  Would I not I wish I was to be try'd  Will  Will  I wish you were I am sure you would be sick of it  Tho  Why now Brother  Will  that cannot be for my Grievance is just the contrary to yours for I have been the uneasiest Boy alive I have got a Master that lives exactly like your Father  Will  My Father Alas my Father is but an ordinary Man your Master is an Alderman  Tho  I mean as to Religion  Will  'tis true my Master goes to the Meetinghouse and my Mistress goes to Church and they serve God there after their Way and we have nothing of Swearing Cursing or Drunkenness in the House or such as that I must do them that Justice but as to Religion I never heard a Word of it in the House since I came to it  Will  Well now  and yet every body says your Master is a very good Man  Tho  That may be  Will  Why then  Brother  you see you were mistaken before when you fancied a Man could not be a good Man without making such a Pother about his Praying and his Religion as my Master does I do not see that my Master is a jot better Man than yours  Tho  Nay  Will  it was not I was mistaken it was your own Father was mistaken who you acknowledge told you  he loved your Master because he was a good Man  and  that you might learn good Things there and that if you followed your Master's Advice you would be a good Man too and a better Man than your Father  he must be mistaken in all that  Will  Will  Well but I a'n't talking of my Father they may be any of them better than my Father he knows that himself but I speak of your Master every Body says he is  a good Man  and  a religious Man  and he has the best Reputation in the Town  Tho  Ay Will  he is an honest Man a very fair Man he does no body any Wrong but I have never been bred that Way in my Life I have never heard any such thing as Praying to God or reading the Scriptures in the House since I came hither and yet when I came to him I was told he was a mighty Religious Man  Will  Why that's what I say  he is counted a religious Man and they say he goes to the  Meetinghouses  too  Tho  So much the worse for him if he appear religious only and his Practice makes him appear to be otherwise however I will not say what he is privately but this I am sure of it does not appear  in his Family we that are Servants see nothing of it nor his Children either  Will  Why  that is as I would have it be at our House he is a very good Man every body says so and what need he trouble you with it I don't like this making such a Show of Religion can't they be Religious but they must trouble all the Family with it I believe your Master is a very honest good Man  Tom  tho' he makes no Show of it as mine does  Tho  You talk prophanely again  Will I am no more for making a Show of Religion than you  but  if there be no Religion where there is some Show of it to be sure there is no Religion where there is  no Show  at all of it  but what do you call  Show  Is it not every Christian Man's Duty to teach his Houshold and Family to serve God Do you call that a Show Every one ought to make such a Show of Religion and if he does not he plainly makes a Show of having very little Religion himself I might give you a great many Places out of Scripture for this but it seems you han't read much out of the Bible  Will  Why what would you have your Master do You would not have him make such a Rout as my Master does would you  Tho  I would have him serve God in his Family as other religious good People do  Will  Well but you say they all serve God a  Sundays  Tho  What's that to his Family We may run about where we will for all him  Sabbathday  or any Day or Night he never takes any Thought for us we are but in the Countinghouse next Morning  when he wants us  we may serve God or the Devil it's all one to him  Will  That's what I want now  I wonder  you should be uneasie at it  Tho  I have not been used to such a Life  Will  tho' you have it terrifies me so I cannot bear it  Will  Why what would you have what is it to you what your Master does  Tho  A great deal God has said  He will pour out his Fury upon the Families that call not upon his Name  Jer And I am one of the Family now  Will  Well but can you not say  your Prayers  by your self  Tho  Truly  I have no manner of Convenience for that neither for we all lie together in a Room and at first I us'd to kneel down and pray by my self but the rest of the Apprentices jeer'd me out of it and made such a Noise at me I was forc'd to leave it off and now I go to Bed and rise like a Beast as they do but it grieves me so I cannot tell what to do for I am sure it is a Sin to do so and I am afraid God should show some Judgment upon me for it  Will  Why is there any Danger of that  Tom  why I never prayed to God in my Life  Tho  Then you are in a fad Condition  Will  and so am I too sometimes I think it will break my Heart I think my Father has put me in the Devil's Mouth and I am going the strait Road to Hell I am sure he does not do so himself  Will  And so you have left off saying your Prayers  Tom  now quite han't you And then you live as bad as I do don't you  Tho  No I han't left off praying neither for if my Master does but send me of an Errand I pray as I go along the Streets and sometimes I get up into the Hayloft over the Stable or any where that I can be private but this is so seldom  and it grieves me so that when I come to pray I can do nothing but cry I can't speak a Word hardly  Will  I do not understand these Things sure I am a strange Creature Why it never troubles me I don't know what 'tis to pray to God I never knew there was any harm in not doing it I wish I could learn I'd say my Prayers too  The Boy begins to be touch'd with the Discourse  Tho  You have a good Master to teach you I have a Master will do nothing but teach me to forget all that my good Father and Mother have been teaching me these Fifteen Years  Will  Why if what you learnt is good what need you forget it  Tho  Why I'll tell you  Will  when I was at Home and had all the Encouragement in the World by the Example and Instruction of my Father and the Exhortation of my Mother telling me my Duty and strictly charging me never to lie down or rise without praying to God in the Evening for Protection in the Morning for Direction yet I found a wicked Inclination within me often prompting me to omit my Duty  and now  when I want these Helps of Example and Instruction and instead of them have had so many Discouragements and find it so difficult to get a retir'd Place for it I find that wicked Inclination to omit my Duty encreases and sometimes I am for perswading my self I have a sufficient Excuse to leave it quite off and I am afraid some time or other I shall do so and so grow an Atheist and then I shall live without God  like a Heathen  just as you do  Will  Will  Indeed  Tom  I have liv'd like a Heathen all my Days I begin to see it now but what must I do How can I help it now  Tho  Do  Will  You must leave it off and learn to live a better Life  Will  But  Brother Tom  how must I do that I am a poor ignorant Wretch  I know nothing at all  I have never been taught any thing in my Life if to live as I do is to be a Heathen my Father is a Heathen and my Mother is a Heathen and my Brothers and Sisters are all Heathens  Tho  You are in a sad Condition  Will  as I said before and I think I am in a worse  Will  How can that be  Tom  Tho  Why you have been taught nothing and I am in a fair way to lose all I have been taught I think my Condition is worse than yours  Will  No no  You know what to do and what you ought to do you have been well Educated  Tom  I have no body to teach me any Thing Tell me dear Brother what I must do teach me what is my first Duty I begin to see something very desirable in Religion that I never valued before  The first Motions in an uncultivated Mind generally are to see a Beauty in the Ways of God and to have a Desire to imitate them  Tho  Why  Will  I am but a Boy as well as you and can't teach you much but I can tell you what my Father used to tell me and what he taught me to do  Will  Do  tell me that then for I long to hear  Tho  Why he used to tell me that  God made me  and that being born in Sin and liable to Eternal Death for Sin  Jesus Christ  redeemed me  Will  All that I have heard too tho' I do not understand a Word of it  Tho  Then he told me I must every Day pray to God  to bless me to preserve me  and  to pardon  my Sins for  Jesus Christ's  Sake that I must give Thanks to him  for my Life  and  my Preservation  in Health and for all Things that  I receive  that I must pray to him for my daily Bread and to give me Wisdom and Direction in all I go about  Will  How can I do this  Tho  I remember I ask'd my Father that very Question and he answer'd me thus Do you not come to me Child when you want Cloaths and ask me for them and to your Mother when you are hungry and ask for Victuals and do you not do this without teaching  Will  And what did you say  Tom  What could I say I kneel'd down every Night and Morning and said over the Lord's Prayer then I got a good Prayer out of a Book and said that and sometimes a Word or two would come into my Thoughts that I would say of my own Head as I thought of such Things as were proper  Will  I shall never learn why I can hardly say over the Lord's Prayer without Book  Tho  I'll tell you  Will  if I thought you were in earnest I would do my Endeavour to teach you but you that have led such a wicked Life and cry out of your Master and Mistress so much about Praying I don't think you mean any thing but to jest with me  Will  No but I do not jest now you say it is so wicked a Thing and I am in such a dangerous Condition that you look'd for the Ground to open and swallow me up why you can't think I would be willing to have the Devil take me away  what ever I may say sometimes  but I am a poor ignorant Boy how shall I know what to do  Tho  Truly  Will  and I also am but ignorant as I said before and unfit to teach you I am but a Boy you know  but this I know and have been taught  that God has made me do you believe that  Will  Will  Yes sure  Tho  Well if God made you then he can destroy you  Will  That is plain  Tho  Then sure 'tis your Interest to serve God as well in Thankfulness to him because he made you as that he may not be provoked to destroy you  Will  But what is this serving God I thought it was nothing but going to Church a  Sundays  Tho  To be sure worshipping God at Church is good and our Duty but we must worship God other ways than at Church  Will  What by saying our Prayers  Tho  Nay that is not all neither we must fear God and keep his Commandments  Will  How shall I do all that You know that I know nothing of it  Tom  Why therefore  Will  your first thing as the first Thing my Father told me I was to do was to pray to God to teach me to know him and to fear him and to keep his Commandments  Will  How do I know what his Commandments are I can say the Ten Commandments but I don't understand what they mean  Tho  Why my Father next directed me to read the Bible which is the Word of God and is given for our Instruction that we may know his Will  Will  And will that teach me to know what to do  Tho  Reading the Scripture daily and praying to God daily to open our Understanding to know  the Will of God written in his Word certainly this must be the way  Will  Will  I can't Pray  I never pray'd in all my Life  I tell you  Tho  You ought to tremble at the Thought of that  Will  Will  I begin to be afraid indeed it may be God won't hear me now if I should Pray  Tho  Yes there's a Scripture for that to encourage you  Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and he will have Mercy  Isaiah  Will  Is that in the Bible  Tho  Yes and a great many more encouraging Things You must read the Scripture diligently Have you never a Bible  Will  No  not I  nor never had in my Life  Tho  I am not capable to direct you  Will  but I will tell you there are two Things which I would have you do pray to God to forgive your Sins and to teach you his Will and read the Bible diligently I'll give you a Bible  Will  Will  Indeed Brother  Tom  if you will give me a Bible I'll read it  over  and  over  you say that will teach me  I'll read it  and thank you for it heartily for I never had a Bible to read in yet  Tho  But remember  Will I said you  must pray to God to teach you when you read to open your Understanding that you may understand the Scriptures and to teach you that you may know your Duty and then pray to God to guide you in the doing his Will and your Duty according to the Scripture which is his own Word  Will  What will my praying to God signifie Will God do this for me if I pray to him And how can I pray I don't know what Praying is  not I  what must I say  Tho  It seems you do not know what Prayer is sure if you remember the Beginning of our Discourse and how you complain'd you were tormented with Prayers at Home you will not say you do not know what it is  Will  Don't tell me of that now  dear Tom  I begin to be of another Mind already I wish I knew how to pray for my self  Tho  The Spirit of God teaches us to pray and helps our Infirmities do you know the Story of the Poor Publican  Will  No not I  what was he  Tho  Just such another as thou art  Will  a poor wicked prophane Wretch that had liv'd all his Days in Wickedness and perhaps without Prayer too  Will  And what then What became of him Did he go to Hell  Tho  Why  he saw the Pharisees and all the great Professors of Religion go up to the Temple to pray and being sensible of his Condition he thought once to go up along with them but when he consider'd what a wicked Creature he had been he was afraid he durst  not only  not go but not look towards the Temple nor cast his Eyes up to Heaven  Will  That is my Case indeed exactly Pray what became of him  Tho  Why he stood at a Distance smote his Breast astonish'd and amaz'd at his own Case and with a deep Sigh broke out thus  Lord be merciful to me a Sinner  Luke  Will  Well and was he heard You say he durst not go up to the Temple to pray  Tho  Heard Yes one Groan one Sigh one Look nay a Heart not daring to look sending out but one Sentence yet from a broken sincere  repenting Heart is heard in Heaven beyond the long and loud Pretences and Devotions of the self opinion'd Hypocrite  The Scripture says expresly  this Man went away justified rather than the other  Luke    Will  And do you think if I knew how to pray God would hear me and give all that Teaching and Knowledge you speak of to me  Tho  Yes Will  I do more than think so I am sure of it  Will  What mean you by that  Tho  I have God's own Word for it  Will  and that Word is the Foundation and Comfort of all the Prayer and of all the praying Christians in the World  Will  How is this explain your self for you speak strangely positive  Tho  The Scripture says he will and that is my Assurance  and may be yours  for it is his own Word  John    WHATEVER we ask of the Father in the Name of Jesus Christ he will do it for us  Will  But I have been a wicked Boy all my Days that never thought of any thing of God or Religion in my Life as you know very well by what I have told you nor ever was taught any thing about it will God hear such a one as I if I ever pray to him  Tho  The same Scripture says he will  Brother  and we have no Reason to doubt it for the Scriptures are the Word of God and  as I told you  the Scripture says  Isaiah    Let the wicked forsake his way and turn unto the Lord and he will have Mercy  and the Poor Publican went away justified that sent up but one Sigh  Will  AY  that may be to such as sin now and then a little but I have done nothing else all my Days  Tho  But he says in the same Text  that he will abundantly Pardon  Will  But that may not reach me  Tho  But the Scripture is full of  PROMISES  and calls to as bad as you to come to him I could shew you some if I had the Bible here you can't have been so wicked but you are included in them  Will  Tell me one of them I intreat you I see you have a deal of it without Book  dear Tom  tell me one of them  Tho  This is one  Him that comes unto me I will in no wise cast out  Here is no Exception this  Him  is all one as  WHOSOEVER  Will  WHOSOEVER  That's a large Word is there no Exception  Tho  None at all  WHOSOEVER  that includes how bad soever  Will  What and  how LONG soever too  Tho  Ay  and  how long soever WHOSOEVER  turns unto God  how bad SOEVER  they are or  how long SOEVER  they have been so bad yet he will  in no wise  or by no means  cast them out  Will  My Heart revives at that Word for I have been a sad Wretch you know  Brother  I have never so much as thought of my Soul or of God of his making me or his Power to destroy me I have never pray'd unto him or call'd upon him unless in wicked Swearing and Cursing by his Name will God pardon me  Brother  are you sure of it  Tho  I cannot be sure he will pardon you or my self either but I am sure it is your Duty to pray for Pardon and to repent of your Sins and there is another Scripture which says  if we repent and forsake we shall find Mercy  Will  Repent what's that  Tom  Tho  Repentance is a hearty Sorrow for your Sins already past and solemn serious Resolutions to commit no more and this Sorrow must proceed not only from a Fear of Eternal Punishment but from a Hatred of Sin for its own evil Nature and as it is offensive to the Holiness of God  Will  I cannot understand this at all shall I learn it in my Bible  Brother  How must I learn to repent  Tho  You must pray to God to give you Repentance too for  Repentance is the Gift of God  Will  I will pray to God tho' I do not know how or what to say I am amaz'd at my self when I see what a wicked Creature I have been indeed  Brother Tom  I don't wonder that you look'd so earnestly at me and expected I should drop down dead or be swallow'd up alive I am afraid I shall be so still  Conviction of Sin seizes the Boy  Tho  I am glad what I have said has made you sensible of it  Will  I begin to love you  dear Brother  better than ever I did I shall be the better for you as long as I live  Tho  I wish you had some better Instructor than I  Will  Ay  Brother if I had had a religious Father and Mother  as you have had  I might have known all this from a Child then all the past Wickedness of my Life had been prevented but you say  WHOSOEVER Brother  don't you Are you sure the Words are so  Tho  I am very sure  Brother  but to make you easie I'll go in and fetch you a Bible and shew it you presently  The Boy goes in  while he is gone  Will  breaks out thus  by himself  Will  What must I do to know how to pray will God hear such a Wretch and what if not  then I am undone lost and damn'd for ever O what a Condition am I in but  WHOSOEVER  The Boy weeps but recovering prays with great Affection and aloud like the poor Publican in the following Words  Lord God that has made me and hast said  WHOSOEVER  comes  thou wilt not c  st out  pardon all my Wickedness  TOM comes and overhears him  Tho  What was you saying  Brother  Did you speak to me  Will  No no  I did not speak to you  Tho  I heard you say something  Will  I hardly know what I said but my Heart struck me and I cried out  Tho  To God I hope  Will  I hardly know yet I feel a secret Joy in what I said  Observe here Conviction was accompanied with a cleaving to the Promise of God and the Spirit of God moves the poor Boy's Heart to look up to God in hope first pleading the Promise and then crying for Pardon  Tho  Well Brother if it was but like the Publican it may be heard  Will  I know not what it was but I am trembling still  Is this Praying  Brother  Tho  The more your Affection was engaged the more likely it is to be from a true Work of God  Will  Have you brought the Bible You have staid a long while  Tho  I have been looking some Places for you  Will  And will you show me them  Tho  Yes I have folded 'em down and here they are in the first Place here's that I nam'd to you  John    Him that comes unto me I will in no  wise cast out  and here is another Place which is equal in its Encouragements and expresly tells us that the Word  HIM  is to be taken for  WHOSOEVER  without any Exception of Person as I said to you before  Rev    Let him that is a thirsty come and WHOSOEVER WILL let them take of the water of Life freely  Will  You have folded them down you say I'll read them when I come home for it is too late for us to stay any longer  The End of the First Dialogue  Notes  on the First Dialogue  THO' this Dialogue and indeed this whole Part of the Book is more a History than the rest and that the Families which it points at if they happen to see it may be able to see themselves in it and to make some Use of it to their own Advantage if they please Yet as even this History will be the same thing as a Parable to the Ages to come in which it may I hope be as useful now and  above all  as this Work is design'd for a general not a particular Reproof I am willing to let it lie hid entirely  as to Persons  that it may perhaps look less by that means like a History than really it is  If the Persons whom it more really concerns may see themselves reproved they will make not the less profitable Use of it for the Civility shown them in concealing their Names if they do not  the Author can never want Opportunity to expose the Folly  if he sees Cause  But the Design of this Book is of a Nature above a Personal Satyr the Errors in FamilyConductare the Business here not the Families themselves and the Names and Persons are so entirely conceal'd and the real Hstory so couch'd that it is impossible for any body but the Persons themselves to read the People by the Characters  The first Thing reproved here and worth observing is a good Man who had carefully educated and instructed his Child and who  he might easily see  was a sober well inclin'd  Youth  knowing in good Things and desirous of them yet had this Religious Parent forgotten himself and so far forgotten the Good of his Child also as to place him out with a Master who had either no Religion at all  or which was all one to the Child  exercised none of it in his Family nor took any Care or had any Concern for the Souls of his Servants whatever he had for their Bodies  The Child laments this very pathetically tho' in a familiar way to his Comrade he is at first weary of the prophane way of living and then justly afraid that the Interruptions he meets with to his Duty should bring him to an Indifference about it and to believe the Difficulties he found in his way were just Excuses for him in omitting it totally at last  NOTE We have natural Hindrances enough in the way of our Duty from the Aversions of a corrupt Nature so that at the best we shall be ofren backward in and prompted to the Omission of Religious Performances we have therefore great Need to remove all occasional  Obstructions lest Natural Inclination should plead those Obstructions as a just Reason for a total Neglect of Duty  It was not without a just Reason that the poor Child entertain'd a Jealousie of himself lest he should grow cold in Religious Matters from the general Discouragement he met with in a Family where all Religious Duties were totally neglected and himself made a Jest for attempting to do his Duty  This may be a seasonable Caution for such Parents who have any Concern for the Souls of their Children and have taken any Pains with them in their Education  Not to think their Duty discharg'd to them in the due instructing and educating them in their Infancy the Inspection of a Parent does not end there but they ought  To remember that all that good Seed which they had sown may be choak'd if the Child comes into bad Hands afterward and their Son may be lost by a negligent Master as well as a negligent Parent    That therefore  it is their Duty to take care to place their Children in Religious Families or it may be true that they had almost as good never have instructed them at all  It is very strange  but too common  that religious Parents who have taken great Care with their Children when they were at home wholly neglect this and throw their Children away by placing them where the Duties of Religion are not at all regarded and where the Examples of their Masters and the Families they live in quite raise all the Remembrance of former Instruction out of the Mind of the Servant and they grow hardned  in that Neglect by the Authority of their Masters  It is remarkable here farther  how the Duty of Servants is entirely neglected even in those Families where they do regard Religion and where instructing of Children is taken care of as if the Souls of Servants were not under the Inspection of the Master of a Family and were none of his Charge as well as the Souls of his Children  NOTE Apprentices taken into our Houses ought as far as it respects their Souls to be reckon'd as Children for as we take them from the Tuition of their Parents if we act not the Parent to them as well as the Master we may teach them their Trade but we breed them up for the Devil  It cannot be omitted here to observe what Impressions of Religion what Awe of God what Dread of his Judgments the good Instructions of the Father had left on the Mind of this Youth  In his Uneasiness of being placed in an irreligious Family  of which afterwards  His Aversion to the Discourse of his Comrade when he talk'd prophanely  His terrible Apprehensions when the other talk'd blasphemously lest he should fall down dead or the Earth should open and swallow him up  NOTE Tho' 'tis true that in the ordinary Course of Providence God does not deal so with those that blaspheme and provoke him yet since sometimes God has done so and History as well as Scripture is full of dreadful Examples of that kind it is not without its Uses and therefore very commendable to acquaint young Children with such Examples  and to fill their Minds with a due Fear of God's Judgments in the like Cases  Here is Room also for a useful Remark in the Complaint the poor Child makes that having no Retirement for performing his Duty by himself when he went about it publickly the other Servants mock'd and jeer'd him out of it  NOTE  Tho' separate Conveniences cannot always be made for Servants yet Masters should as much as may consist with the Circumstances of their Families be cautious of taking away all manner of Conveniences of Retirement from their Servants lest they furnish them with Excuses for not doing their Duty  NOTE  Jeering and mocking a YoungMan for his inclining to be Religious is too often a Means to drive such quite from it  NOTE  One of the most necessary Preservations of Youth is That he be fortified against the scandalous Banters and Insults of his Companions and can learn to be jeer'd and yet not be jeer'd out of his Duty  The other Part of this Dialogue affords a dreadful instance of a Father and Family wholly destitute of Religion living entirely without God without Scripture without so much as a Form of Religion The Effects of this are especially two and both visible in the Case here laid before us  Perfect Ignorance of every thing that look'd like Religion in the Child not so much as the least Sense of it or Desire to know any thing about it remaining  Certain and never failing bitter Reproaches of the Child against the Parent when its Eyes come to be opened  NOTE  Such is the Beauty of a religious conscientious Life in those that practice it that those who can taste nothing of it themselves yet have a Value for it in others The prophane Boy's Father told him he lov'd his Master  because he was a good Man  and that if he the Boy would take his Master's Advice he would make him a better Man than his Father  NOTE  The Aversions which want of Instruction in this Youth had bred in him against the Religious Behaviour of his Master and against the publick Exercises of Religion in his Family were so foolishly grounded that they would bear no weight in his discoursing it  even with a Child  and therefore the Religious Youth presently objects against what he says and he himself sooner sees the Folly of his own Discourse and yet the Author of this Work is just also to the Thing it self for that really our ridiculous Notions in Contempt of Religion will admit no better Argument to excuse them  Aversions to Religious Duties grow naturally either by Disuse of those Duties or by the Disaster of an ill Education even where the poor hardned Child may think no Harm or design any willful Rebellion against God that Ignorance being the natural Consequence of want of Instruction  Observe here  when the wicked Boy being convinc'd asks his Comrade what he must do he goes back to tell him what his own Father used to teach him Whence  note  that well instructing our Children makes them capable to instruct others  as Occasion presents  and consequently their Children when they come to have Families of their own  From the beginning of the wicked Boy's Convictions  Note  that Sense of Danger is the first thing ordinarily that discovers it self in Conviction of Sin and this leads to enquiring after what we are next to do as the Jailor who first came in trembling then asks  What must I do  When the Boy after his first Conviction recollects things by himself  while his Companion is gone for the Bible  he is struck with Horror at his Condition but the Spirit of God working graciously in him lays the Promise of God  as it were  full in his way in order to give him hope and at the first Appearance of hope he breaks out vehemently in Prayer when his Comrade returns and innocently inquires about what he said it appears from him that his Prayer was a kind of Extasie mov'd by a supernatural Power in his Heart that affected him in a violent manner so that he hardly could give an Account of it himself but says wildly  he trembled and cried out  There are no doubt such strong Impressions of the Spirit of God accompanying true Convictions and the great regenerating Work of Grace in the Heart as may be inexpressible even by the Persons themselves yet far from  Enthusiastick  or affected nor are these Impressions to be slighted much less ridicul'd perhaps this may be in Part signified in Regeneration being called a  New Birth  tho' the main Intent of that Allusion be to signifie the entire Change of the State  From the whole of this Dialogue may be observ'd the great Duty and Advantage of Young Men spending the Hours they have to spare for Conversation in Religious Discourses and enquiring of one another about Things relating to Heaven their Duty here and their Way thither this no doubt was enjoin'd in the same Text  where the Instruction of our Children is commanded  Deut    Thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine House and when thou walkest by the Way THAT IS  they shall be the general Subject of your Conversation and Communication one with another  Note  The Advantages of Religious Conversation are many the present Case is brought to describe them the young untaught uninstructed Youth who came out of the Hands of his Parents to be an Apprentice as perfectly naked of Knowledge and Instruction as he came naked into the World becomes a Convert by his keeping Company and conversing with a religious well instructed Companion and became afterwards an excellent Promoter of Knowledge and Piety in the Place where he lived  The Second DIALOGUE  THE Young Lad who was put Apprentice to the religious Tradesman abovemention'd tho' he had no Education from his Parents was as you have heard in the past Dialogue between him and the Youth his Comrade brought to a Condition quite differentfrom what he had always been brought up in he had a full Conviction of the desperate Condition he was in by reason of his sinful Nature and Life He had receiv'd some Light from the little Instruction his young but pious Companion was capable to give him and his Conscience was thoroughly awaken'd his little Instructor had been providentially made the Instrument to lay a Foundation of Hope in him and to encourage him to pray to God and to read the Scriptures and to believe that God would receive him would not reject him for his sinful Life or for his sinful Nature but would grant him  whatsoever  he should ask and upon this Confidence in his first Agony he breaks out as before into a short but vehement Prayer being the first he had ever made in his Life and which as it was made from a Heart deeply touch'd with the Danger of his Soul so it left great Impressions upon his Mind  as I have noted and having gotten a Bible from his Companion he goes away with two happy Resolves to read and to pray  The Alteration this made in the Youth could not be long hid in the Family where he was plac'd where his wicked way of Living his prophane Tongue and his Contempt of Religion had made him not very well receiv'd and made his Conversation so much their Aversion that the Master of the House and the Mistress too had warn'd their little Children from conversing with him and they had had some Discourse together about turning him away finding him of a Temper as they thought too refractory to be wrought upon by Advice past the Benefit of Example and who had several times made a Jest of and a Scoff at their Attempts to instruct him  But the Boy being changed within  as is noted above  it could not be that such a Work could long conceal it self in his Conversation he appear'd pensive retir'd and grave in his Deportment was observ'd to  sigh  very often and look as if he had been crying as soon as his Business was over he was never to be seen but always hid in the Dark among the Workhouses of which his Master had several he was observed to be always ready at the times of Family worship and on the Lord's Day when his Master examin'd him about the Sermons he had heard they were all surpriz'd at him for the ready Account he gave of what the Minister had preached His Master and Mistress who could not but observe this Alteration in the Boy took the more Notice of him in his Conversation the Week after where they found him diligent at his Work more than ever but nothing of the Mirth and Sport his Fellow Servants used to have with him They observ'd he had left off  all his ill Words and wicked Expressions Swearing Cursing  and the like  he play'd none laugh'd none and hardly was seen to smile Several of the Servants and Workmen that observ'd it also had been jesting with him and ask'd him what ail'd him but he gave them no Answers that were to the purpose so that it was hardly guess'd at in the Family at least not among his Fellows  But his Master and Mistress who from his Behaviour  as above  had entertain'd some Notion of it or being willing to hope the best had pleas'd themselves with some Thoughts of the Child's being grown rather serious than melancholly made it their Business to observe him more narrowly and seeing him one Evening take a Candle and go up into a Room over their Workhouse by himself the Mistress silently followed him and plac'd her self so as she might see him and he perceived nothing of it  As soon as he came up he set down the Candle pull'd a Book out of his Pocket and turn'd over the Leaves folding up here and folding down there but not reading long in any one Place she observ'd him to sigh grievously all the while and at last to throw down the Book and burst out into a vehement Fit of crying sitting down upon the Ground wringing his Hands and the Tears running down his Face but not speaking a Word  While he was in this Agony she discovers herself to have seen him and begins thus  WILL  what's the Matter with you Child  The Boy surpriz'd snatches up the Book hastily and puts it in his Pocket  His Mistress speaks to him again  Mist  Will  what's the matter  Will  tell me  Will  Nothing  Offers to go away  Mist  Come  Will  do not be backward to tell me what troubles thee for I have seen all you have been doing what Book's that you had there  Will  No Book of any harm  Mist  Child  I do not think it is a Book of any harm I believe it is a good Book is it not the Bible  Will  Come tell me  Will  Yes  it is  Mist  Let me see it  Will  Will  You may believe me  it is the Bible  I hope you'll not be angry  Mist  Angry Child  I am glad to see you looking in the Bible I am not angry I hope you are minding good things  So his Mistress sits down by him  Will  Oh it's too late now  Here he falls a crying again and cannot speak for a good while  Mist  Too late  Will  do not talk so  Will  Yes  It's  too late too late  And cries vehemently  Mist  Child  if it be so thy  too late  is much sooner than  my early  was If it be too late for thee what will become of any of us  The Mistress weeps too  Will  That is all one to me it's  too late  for me  Mist  Let me see thy Bible Child where hast thou been reading that has put thee into this Condition  Will  O Every where every where  Mist  Show me the Book  Will  let me see it  He shows her the Book and abundance of Leaves turn'd down but most of them at those Places which had discouraged the Child  Mist  What are all these Leaves turn'd down for and who directed you to these terrible Texts  of Scripture Child You have found all the dreadful Places where God threatens hardned Sinners with his Displeasure but  not one  of those Places which gave Comfort to a returning Penitent  She turns over to the Leaves the Child had folded down which were such as these  Rom  After thy Hardness and impenitent Heart treasurest up against thy self Wrath against the Day of Wrath and Revelation of the Righteous Judgments of God who will render to every Man according to his Deeds  Isaiah  Make the Heart of this People fat and their Ears heavy and shut their Eyes lest they see with their Eyes and hear with their Ears and understand with their Hearts and convert and be healed  And again the same repeated  Mark    Rev    And all Liars shall have their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimstone  Rev  He that is unjust let him be unjust still and he that is filthy let him be filthy still behold I come quickly and my Reward is with me  Thes  In flaming Fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God  c  who shall be punished with Everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord  Psal  The wicked shall be turned into Hell and all the Nations that forget God  Psal  Consider this ye that forget God lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver  Matth  Depart from me ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels  Heb  For our God is a consuming Fire  Isa  Who amongst us shall dwell with Everlasting Burnings  These and abundance more such as these the poor Boy had folded down the reading of which had terrified him to such a Degree as above  The Mistress having look'd them over turns to the Boy  Mist  Child what are all these Scriptures to thee  Will  All  to me  All  to me  He told me all that was said in the Book was said to me  Mist  HE  told thee  Will  prethee who told thee  Will  He that gave me the Book my  Brother Tom  over the Way  he told me so  and he is a very good Young Man and would not speak wrong I am sure it is all said to me  Cries again  Mist  Well  Will  he is a very good Youngman I am glad you have been talking with him and he meant well  no doubt  but he is but a young Lad a Boy a Child like thy self and you may be instructed farther about it do not be cast down was this it you cried about  Will  Yes yes  this was it was not this enough  Mist  Well but you need not be so discourag'd  Will  let me show you some other Texts  Will  What  not to be lost for ever and go to Hell Not be discourag'd  Mist  But are you willing to be better instructed Child  Will  What can instruct me is not this the Word of God and is it not plain Am not I such a wicked one as is describ'd here And is not all that is said here true  Mist  But Child you must take that Part of the Scripture which is a ground of Hope and set it against these terrible Places this is only an Artifice of the Devil to terrifie you  Will  What would he terrifie me for  Mist  That you might despair of the Mercy of God and not hope in Jesus Christ  Will  What can I hope for when these plain Things are said shall belong to such as I am  Mist  No Child  I hope they are not threatned to such as thee they are all to be understood of those that are Impenitent in their Sins and go on hardned without Repentance to the last I hope you will not be found among them are you not sorry for your Sins  Will  What does that signifie now  if I am  Mist  A great deal  even so much  that it takes away the Edge of all those dreadful Scriptures that have frighted thee  so much  and if that Sorrow for thy Sins be true and sincere the Scripture is full of Encouragement for thee  to hope  Will  Ay so he said but he never told me a word of all those Places I have found and I can't find the Promises he told me of I can't find one of them  Mist  That's for want of some body to assist thee and open and explain the Scriptures to thee  poor Child  thou hast had but little teaching  Will  Little I never had any teaching at all I never had a Bible in my Life never knew what it was till now and I think it had been well I had not seen it now  Mist  NO NO Will  do not say so it is the best thing ever was given thee in the World and I hope you shall thank God as long as you live that you meet with that honest Young Man that gave it you he is a godly sober Young Man and has shown thee what it is to be well Educated he came of good Parents and their Instruction is seen in his very Countenance every body loves him he is so sober so religious and talks so well of good Things and it appears I find in his talk to thee tho' being but a Youth he might not be so able to prepare thee for the right Understanding  of the Scriptures when you were to read in as others may  Will  Why he told me it was the Word of God and that all that was written here was true and that it was all spoken to me and I ought to understand it so and bid me read it  Mist  Well  and you have read some of it but not all  Will  Yes I have read all the New Testament  over  and  over  for I sat up three Nights last Week and read all Night long for I promised him I would read it  Mist  Well  and have you not found encouraging Places as well as those that terrified you in this manner  Will  No none at all  Mist  How is that possible if you have read it all over  Will  I am sure I have read it all over Three times from the first of  Matthew  to the last of the  Revelations  Mist  Then your Fears have so prevailed over your Hope that your Eyes have been shut to your Comfort and open only to your Discouragement this is all from the Devil  Will  you must pray against it  Will  So  Tom  said but I can't tell how to pray I never pray'd in my Life but once  Mist  Once  Child  when was that  Will  That Night he talk'd to me  Mist  What did you pray for then and how  Will  I know not how but I trembled and cried out to God to pardon my Sins  Mist  Poor Child What mov'd thee to it then  Will  I felt some strange Motion in my Heart which I cannot describe that made my Tongue speak I almost know not what for I thought it a  dreadful thing to speak to God and when I cried out  Lord pardon my Sins  it set me a weeping and a trembling  Mist  Well that was a blessed Beginning why did you not go on Child You should have prayed again  Will  My Heart did but I could speak no words  Mist  Alas Child that's the Prayer God delights in  SO  may I pray all my Days tho' I was never to speak again  Will  But  Brother Tom  told me I must speak too  Mist  Yes  Child  you may speak and it is proper for your own sake that you speak words both to express your Meaning and move your Affections but unless your Heart joins it is not Prayer God hears no Words that the Heart joins not in but he hears many a Sigh from the Heart which cannot be express'd in Words As is plain from that Text  Rom    The Spirit also helpeth our Infirmities for we know not what to pray for as we ought but the Spirit it self maketh Intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered  I hope it was the Spirit helped thy Heart to pray when thou could'st utter no Words  Child  therefore do not be discouraged  Will  I know nothing what it was or what the Spirit means unless that I have served the  Evil Spirit  all my Days and now I must have my Portion with the Devil and his Angels this Book says so look here else  Shows her the Place  Matth    Mist  Child  You must not make Conclusions against your self any more than  for  your self from the Word of God till you are taught to understand it aright  Will  Why do I not understand this Place right  Mist  No you do not  Will  How shall I understand it then  Mist  You must take the Scriptures as they explain themselves and you are bid to search the Scripture that is to see how one Place is expounded by another you should always pray to God to open your Understanding that you may understand the Scripture and the want of this makes even those very Parts of the Scripture which should be our Comfort be our Terror  Will  Indeed the Young Man told me so but I did not do it  Mist  What did he bid you do  Will  When he gave me the Book I thank'd him and promised him to read it but he said that was not all I must pray to God to teach me to understand his Word and to show me my Duty and to guide my Heart to do it but I did not know that I should always do this when I read the Bible  Mist  No doubt but you may pray very seasonably for that at all times and he was a good Child that taught thee to do so but it must needs be more especially seasonable to pray so when you are going to read the Bible that you may be instructed to reap Comfort from God's Word and not Terror only  as you have done  Will  What Comfort can I get from the Scripture when it speaks so dreadfully of my very Case  Mist  Why there lies your Mistake  I say it is not your Case  and therefore you may reap Comfort from the Scripture  come Child  let us see and examine strictly what your real Case is it may be we may find Reason  even from this very Book  to make you hope that your Case is not included or spoken to in any of these Texts and if it should appear so would you not be very glad  Will  Yes  I should be glad  but I believe that's impossible  Mist  No no  Child  it is not impossible the first Part of your Case is this That you have been a great Sinner  Will  As ever was born in the World  Mist  Well suppose so  tho' that is not true neither  for poor Child you have not sinned against Light and against Knowledge and against Conscience for thou wast never taught to know God or his Ways or instructed in thy Duty I am a worse Sinner than thou a great deal But suppose all you say suppose you are a great Sinner yet you say you are sorry and if you thought God would forgive you would it not rejoice your Heart  Will  Oh If that were possible  Mist  And are you as willing to go on wickedly as you were before  Will  No  I abhor and abominate it  He weeps here again  Mist  And would you serve and obey and please God if he will forgive you  Will  Ay with all my Heart nay whether he would forgive me or no I would never be wicked again if I could help it it is the abominablest Life I hate my self for it  Mist  But if you were assur'd God would pardon you what would you do  Will  O If that were possible  Mist  Come Child  look then into this blessed Book again you are a Sinner but you are not an impenitent Sinner  you say you  abhor and abominate your Sins and hate your self for them  you say  you would not go on in Wickedness nay tho' God should not forgive what is past  you say  you would serve and please and obey God with all your Heart  If all this be true  then I tell thee Child not one of these terrible Scriptures which have so discouraged thee and so frighted  thee are spoken to thee or meant of thee no not one of them  Will  Why my  Brother Tom  said all that was written in this Book was said to me  Mist  That is  Child  if thou art  SO  and  SO  as these Scriptures describe and if not then they are spoken to give thee hope otherwise the Scriture would contradict it self  and not be true  which is blasphemous to imagine  Will  I do not understand how you mean  Mist  Why  Child look here  look upon the very Texts you have folded down some of them explain themselves to be just as I say  Rom  v  After thy Hardness and impenitent Heart treasurest up Wrath  c Now it is plain thou art not hardned and impenitent but God has given thee a penitent repenting Heart I hope it is a sincere one  therefore  by the Words themselves thou art not one of them that  treasure up Wrath against the Day of Wrath  so for that Scripture  Isaiah    Thine Eyes are not shut  nor  thy Ears heavy  nor  thy Heart fat  that is rebellious and contemning God for that Text is plainly spoken of such whom God judicially hardens and of no other in like manner all the other Texts every one of them are Expressions signifying the Wrath and Vengeance of God against such as die in their Sins or continue perverse hardned and impenitent  Will  How shall I be sure that is so  Mist  By comparing those Scriptures  Child  with such other Texts as explain their Meaning as are given to encourage our returning to God and contain his Promises of Pardon to those who repent  Will  Where are they I have read the whole Book and cannot find them  Mist  Look here Child  John  v  If we confess our Sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our Sins and to cleanse us from all Ʋnrighteousness  Here 'tis plain tho' you are a great Sinner yet if  you confess  he  will forgive you  and you may observe he does not say he is  gracious  and  merciful  to forgive but  just  and  faithful  implying that having before in his Grace and Mercy pass'd to us his Promise of Forgiveness it becomes  humbly speaking  a kind of Demand and as he is just and faithful therefore he must and will nay he cannot fail to make good those Promises to us  Will  But where are those Promises then I can find none of them in all the Bible  Mist  O the whole Scripture is full of them  Prov    He that covereth his Sins shall not prosper but WHOSO confesseth and forsaketh them SHALL have Mercy  Isaiah  Let the Wicked forsake his Way and the Ʋnrighteous Man his Thoughts and turn unto the Lord and he WILL have Mercy and to our God for he WILL abundantly pardon  Will  That he told me of but I can't find it  Mist  Here it is Child  in the Prophecy of  Isaiah  Will  Is that the Word of God too  Mist  Yes and that Prophet is counted the most excellent of all the Prophets for these things and is therefore called the Evangelical Prophet  Will  But there are more in other Places are there not  Mist  Yes Child  especially in those Places that speak of Christ in whom all are to be saved  Will  Let me hear them for I do not understand this being redeemed by Christ's Death at all tho'  Tom  said something of that to me  Mist  You understand that you have been a wicked Boy a great Sinner and was born in Sin your Father was a Sinner before you  Will  Yes I understand that too well  Mist  Well Jesus Christ who is the Son of God came into the World to save such as you nay and worse than you and he died to bring this to pass this you must believe  Will  Does the Scripture say this  Mist  Yes  look here  Rom    For when we were yet without Strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly  Pet  For Christ also hath once suffered for Sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God  Acts  Him hath God exalted with his Right Hand to be a Prince and a Saviour for to give Repentance and Remission  Tim  This is a faithful Saying and worthy of all Acceptation that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners  Matth  I am not come to call the Righteous but Sinners to Repentance  Are not these Things plain  Child  Will  But I am afraid  Mist  Of what Child  Will  That it is not for me I am not one of them else why was I not taught to know this before  Mist  Here is a Text for that too  Child Mark    Be not afraid only believe  Will  What must I believe And what if I do believe  Mist  The Scripture is plain that we shall be saved by Faith in him notwithstanding all the terrible Scriptures you have found out  Matt    His Name is Jesus for he shall save his People from their Sins  Acts  By him all that believe are justified  Rom  These Things are written that ye might believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God  and that believing ye might have Life through his Name  John  He that heareth my Word and believeth on him that sent me has Everlasting Life and shall not enter into Condemnation  Rom  There is therefore now no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus  Fold all these Texts down Child and remember to read them over when thou art tempted to be doubting of God's Mercy in Christ  Will  But will Christ receive me now  Mist  Yes yes  He has made a gracious Promise to thee himself for that  John    HIM that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out  The Boy starts at those Words  Mist  What do'st start at Child  Will  That's the blessed Place that my dear Teacher told me of and that work'd  ALL  and now I can't find it  Mist  Work'd all what Child  Will  That was the Text that made my Heart melt and tremble and made me  pray to God  and I have read over the whole Book and can't find it tho' I made him turn down a Leaf at it I am sure it is not in the Book  Mist  Not in the Book  God forbid why here it is Child look at it read it and God give thee Comfort of it  The Boy reads and Tears fall from his Eyes for Joy as before for Sorrow  Will  Ay here it is here it is I will come to him I will pray to him  He kisses the Book with great Affection and receives Comfort from it  The End of the Second Dialogue  Notes  on the Second Dialogue  THE Impressions of the serious Discourse mention'd in the first Dialogue that this Young Man had with his Comrade were so great that they could not be concealed  Note  A Change wrought in the Heart will infallibly shew it self in the Conversation  The Master and Mistress being good People themselves receiv'd Impressions of the Alteration in the Boy suitable to the Nature of the thing but the rest of the Servants dreamt nothing of it  Note  The Symptoms of Conversion are easily discovered by those who know the working of the Spirit of God while they are perfectly invisible to others  By the Agony the Boy was in at the reading the Comminations of the Scripture against Sin without the promisory Part may be observ'd  That meer Convictions of Sin drive to Despair but neither direct to nor enquire after a Remedy  That Comforting Scriptures generally want explaining terrifying Scriptures explain themselves  Here may be worth observing  The Benefit of Religious Conversation even among young Children and the great Duty of making our Society instructing to one another  The Advantage of placing Children in Religious Families  If this poor Child had not fallen in such a Family as this the Temptation he was under to despair might in all Probability have prevail'd over him and either have led him to give over his Enquiry after Religious Matters or if God had not restrain'd  him have driven him to Extremities such as Distraction and perhaps Selfdestruction as is often the Consequence too in like Cases for  a wounded Spirit who can bear  Observe the poor Child's Fear of its being too late for him to find Mercy or be accepted  If it might be too late for him what have they to fear who run on to grey Hairs in an impenitent State Well might his Mistress observe that  his too late  was sooner than  her early  and so it is with many  From the good Woman's applying the Scriptures to him for Comfort observe how the Scriptures are to be read  With serious seeking God for the Assistance of his Spirit to open our Understandings that we may understand the Scriptures for without his Teaching all our Reading will be in vain  With a due comparing one Text with another that the Scriptures being their own just Expositor may reconcile the Truths of God as they ought to be understood  For want of this we rob our selves of the Comfort of the Scriptures pass over those Things prepared to heal and restore the Soul and fill our Hearts with distracting Doubts about our own State which are always harder to be resolved and removed by how much they seem confirmed by the mistaken Authority of the Scripture  Observe The good Woman finding the Boy had receiv'd Comfort from that blesied Promise of our Lord and that he was affectionately expressing his Resolution to cast himself at the Foot of Christ crying out  I will  come to him and in  a kind of a Rapture kissing the Words which she had shewed him she wisely withdrew believing it was a happy Juncture in which the Child ought to be left alone that he might give himself full Vent with Fervency and Earnestness to call upon God and tho' this causes the Dialogue to break off sooner and more abruptly than it might have done yet it is conceived as much is here set down as may answer the Design of it  viz  The Instruction of others  Ending these Notes with this Observation for the Reader's Information That as far as this Account is really Historical and points at any particular Family this Boy or young Man came to be eminent for Piety and a Religious Life in the Place where he liv'd and being settled in that Country was a very useful Instrument in the propagating Christian Knowledge and supporting the Interest of true Religion in all the Country round him and perhaps is living still  The Third DIALOGUE  THE Young Lad who had been so happily Instrumental in the Conviction and Conversion of his Comrade had thereby render'd himself so agreeable to the good People who as I said before was Master and Mistress of the other Lad that they could not but be very willing to converse a little with him themselves and to that End caused their Apprentice who called him  Brother  to bring him to their House where in time he became very intimate and they were much pleased and diverted with his pretty Discourses which were always about Religion and serious Things  Among the rest of his Discourse he never forgot to bemoan himself for his being placed in a Family of no Religious Orders without the Worship of God in it and where he had neither publick Opportunity to serve God or private Retirement for the Discharge of his Duty  The good People encouraged him to bear it and seriously advised him not to let the Sense of his own Duty to wear off or allow himself in the Omission of private Prayer to God whatever Obstructions he met with for Want of Retirement  and Opportunity and invited him to come over to their House as often as he could at their Hours of FamilyWorship and join with them  This he not only gladly accepted but constantly attended and did it so avowedly not regarding how it might interfere with his Master's Hours and his own Conveniencies that his Master took Offence at his being so often out of the way and not knowing the least of what occasioned his Absence complain'd to his Father of it as if it had been some wicked Course he had followed telling him  that  his Son did not behave himself orderly  that  he was out of his Business unseasonably  that  he must have some bad Haunts for that he generally went out every Morning very early being then Winter long before Day and in the Evenings was absent often at Supper  that  on the Lord's Day Evening he was never to be found  and the like  and therefore desired his Father to take some Care about him for that if he went on he would be ruin'd He farther acquainted his Father that the Boy had appear'd very melancholly and discontented that he had ask'd him often if any thing ail'd him or that he was not well and he always answer'd  yes  that he had ask'd him if he did not like his Business and still he answer'd  yes very well  so that he knew not what ail'd him and desir'd his Father to talk with him for if he carried it thus he could not bear it but must send him Home again  The Father  who knew his Son to be a sober religious Child and partly knew the Reason of his Discontent was not at all surpriz'd at that Part of his Master's Complaint which related to his appearing melancholly and dissatisfied but the other Part of his Discourse alarm'd him a little about being out of the House at unseasonable Hours  and giving no Account of himself and therefore he readily promised to talk with his Son and examine him about it that his Conduct might be rectified  Accordingly he finds an Opportunity to talk with the Lad and lets him know all his Master had laid to his Charge charging him to tell him the Truth of the whole Matter The Boy not at all surpriz'd told his Father the whole Case very honestly  how that  his Master had no such Thing as Familyworship in his House but that they lived all like Heathens there pursuing  the World  as if it was their Heaven without the least regard of their Duty to God or any thing that was religious  "And you Sir  says the Boy to his Father  having always instructed me in other Things and taught me to live after another Manner it was very uneasie to me as I have formerly hinted to you but I have of late made my self a little easie by getting an Acquaintance in Mr 's Family an honest Clothier who lives over against our House who are very good People and who constantly go to Prayers every Morning at Six a Clock and every Evening about Eight or Nine and I get up every Morning to go over there to Prayers with their Family and every Lord's Day I go thither in the Evening where the good Man reads to his Family and examins his Children and Servants and then prays with them while at our House all the Evening is spent in Feasting and Visiting or idle Discourse not at all to the Business of the Day And this is the whole Case  When the Lad had ended his Discourse and the Father was assur'd of the Truth of it he took his Son in his Arms and kissed and embraced him very affectionately and said  "The Blessing of God and thy Father be upon thee  my Dear  that has made so good a Use of so unhappy an Omission of mine It was my Sin  my Dear  and an inexcusable Error in me to put thee out in a Family where the Name of God is not call'd upon and the Worship of God not regarded by which I run the Venture of thy Soul's Good and of having all the Pains I had taken in teaching and instructing thee in the Ways of God and in the Knowledge of Religion  lost and abused  and had it been so thy Ruin had been at my Door having regarded the Trade and the Prospect of worldly Advantage only in placing thee out not the good of thy Soul but since God has given thee Grace to prevent the Evil which might through my Neglect have befallen thee  the Praise be to his Mercy  I am fully satisfied in what you have done and if your Master speaks of it to you as I suppose he will I would have you tell him the whole Truth as you now do to me and if he dislikes you for it  offer to go back to your Father  and if he consents I shall as gladly take you from him as I received you from God when you was born  The Child encouraged by his Father thus to deal plainly with his Master and being a Lad very ready of Speech tho' modest withal in his Behaviour resolves the first Occasion his Master should give him to do it effectually which his Master not failing to do the same Evening produc'd the following Discourse between them  The Youth it seems had been over at the good People's House as usual during their FamilyWorship and coming in about Nine a Clock at Night his Master begins with him thus  Master  THomas  where are you  Tho  Here Sir  Ma  Have you been abroad to Night  Tho  A little Sir  Ma  How long have you been out  Tho  Not above half an Hour Sir at most  Ma  Where have you been  Tho  I have been no farther than at Mr 's over the Way  Ma  Well but  Thomas  I must talk with you a little I have observ'd it and others have observ'd it here in the House that your Conduct is alter'd very much from what it us'd to be and you seem dull and melancholly I must know what is the matter with you If you do not like your Business tell me honestly  Thomas  tho' you are bound I will not keep you against your Will I have a Respect for you and for your Father and I won't force your Inclination if you are willing to go  Thomas  you shall and therefore I would have you speak plainly what is it you dislike the Trade for  Tho  No Sir I don't dislike the Trade at all but and you please to let me go I shall be very  Here his Master interrupts him  Ma  Well  Thomas  but I am willing to know wh'at the Reason is too what do you dislike do you dislike your Master  Tho  No Sir not in the least I assure you I have no Reason for it  Ma  What then  Has any body in the House ill us'd you  Tho  No indeed Sir  Ma  What then  Tho  Nothing  but if you think fit to let me  Ma  No Thomas  never without a Reason for it that would be to have some other Reasons given afterwards for it which are not  true  Tho  If you think so Sir I am very willing to stay and do my Business  Ma  Well Thomas  but whether you go or stay I must know the Cause of your Discontent  Tho  I'll be better contented Sir than I have been if I can rather than displease you  Ma  No Thomas  that won't satisfie me neither for I have some Discontents as well as you  Thomas  and if you stay with me you must remove my Discontents as well as your own  Tho  I shall be very willing to remove any Discontents you have  Sir  if I can I hope I do not neglect your Business Sir  Ma  I do not say my Business is neglected but you take a Liberty to go out and stay out so very often as makes me uneasie I must be a little satisfied  Thomas  about that  Tho  Sir you were pleased to tell us when I was first bound that if we were in the Warehouse at such and such Times when your Business required you cared not whither we went at other Times and I never have fail'd your Business Sir nor your Hours  Ma  But you are out at unseasonable Hours  Thomas  and that is not of good Reputation to your self  Tho  I thought  Sir  you did not regard that when you left us so entirely to our selves if it is offensive to you I will refrain it tho' I should be very sorry to be restrain'd  Ma  But I must know the Occasion of it as well as of your apparent Dissatisfaction also  Thomas  sure you may be free with me come let me know the Truth  Tho  You will perhaps be displeas'd with me  Sir  if I tell you the Truth or think I do not  Ma  If that Truth be justifiable why should I be displeased if not why should I not be displeased  Tho  There may be Reasons for your Displeasure tho' the thing be justifiable  Ma  Let the Thing then appear to be justifiable  first  and if I am unreasonable we shall talk of that afterwards If you can justifie the Thing it self why should you be backward to let me know it  Tho  Sir  As you are my Master and I am your Servant I was bound to give you an Account of my Time but the Liberty you gave all your Servants to go where they pleas'd provided they were at Home at such and such Times has sufficiently  as I conceived  justified my being abroad even without giving an Account  Ma  But I did not take from my self the Liberty of enquiring whither you went or of altering that License I had given if I saw it abused and since you have taken the Liberty and refuse to give me a reasonable Account of it I now recall it and expect you to be found always at Home unless I give you leave  Tho  As I took only the Liberty you gave Sir I shall exactly obey you in the Restraint however hard I may think it  Ma  But there are some other Reasons why I ought to insist upon knowing where you have been and how you have spent your Time at the Hours you have been missing and I think it concerns your Reputation to have me satisfied  Tho  Whether it concerns my Character or no  Sir  if you command it I think it my Duty to obey you I avoided it only that you might not be displeased with me  Ma  Since you chuse to obey it as my Command rather than comply with it as my Request you must be gratified then by telling you I do demand an Account of it  Tho  Sir all the Time I have spent out of your House or out of your Business except only the Times I have ask'd you leave to see my Father has been over the Way at Mr  's  the Clothier  Ma  What is it there you have been gone in the Morning before Day  Tho  Yes Sir  Ma  What can the Meaning of that be Sure you have some earnest Business there and I suppose it must be something he or his Wife was not to know that requir'd you to be there with his Servants every Day before their Master and Mistress was up  Tho  I have told you nothing Sir but the Truth  Ma  Well I shall enquire nothing of your Business I know my Neighbour  s  is a good Man and it is his Business to look after his Servants I shall give him Notice to do so in the mean time I shall acquaint your Father of your Practice and let him enquire after it it is no Business of mine I don't trouble my self with what Courses you take but while you are with me I expect you attend your Business  Tho  I must obey you  Sir  tho' I think it hard if you will not dismiss me your Business it must be as it pleases God  The Master goes out and leaves him the Boy's Father being impatient to know what would pass in the Conference was come to the House tho' late the Master finds him waiting for him and begins warmly  Ma  How do you  Sir  I doubt I have no very good News to tell you  Fa  About what Sir  Ma  About your Son he and I have had a little Brush this Evening  Fa  I am sorry for that I hope he does not misbehave himself or neglect his Business  Ma  I can't say much for that but as I told you formerly he has gotten some ill Haunts among the Neighbours Servants and he is out with them every Night and Morning nay in the Morning before Day and every  Sabbath day  after Sermon I see nothing of him at least for that Night and I can get nothing out of him but if I talk a little to him he is for going away and coming back to you again  Fa  What can this Business be before Day  Ma  Nay I have nothing to do with that  take him to Task about it your self it is your Business  he is your Son he is none of mine  you said you would talk with him before  Fa  But Sir  tho' he be my Son yet he is your Servant tho' I did talk a little with him yet I said the less because I cannot be of your Opinion that you have nothing to do with it is he not entirely under your Government  Ma  Ay  as to Business I have the Government of him indeed and I am to teach him his Trade and to see that he does my Business and so I will while he stays with me what can I do farther  Fa  But Sir  as I put him Apprentice to you I committed him to your Government entirely Soul and Body I hope you have some little Concern for your Servants besides just their doing your Business  Ma  Why  what can I do more than restrain them if I see them take bad Courses And I have done so to yours I have forbid him going there any more  Fa  It is not for me to teach you  Sir  what to do but if you will bear with me  Ma  Ay  very freely very freely you know I have Respect enough for you to hear any thing may and for your Son too I'd do any thing I can I should be very sorry to have the Boy ruin'd he is a promising Young Man enough  Fa  Why  as to that  Sir  in particular I will speak afterwards but I am first upon the general you seem to go upon this Point That you think your self not oblig'd to take any farther Concern upon you about your Servants than just to restrain them if you see them take ill Courses or to acquaint their Friends with it and that your main Care is to see that your Business is done  If I take you right  this is what you said  Ma  It is so  why  what can I do more  Fa  A great deal Sir And I think a great deal more is your Duty as a Master  Ma  What more can be expected of me  Fa  Really Sir  If you will pardon me I think you have the whole Duty and Authority of a Parent devolv'd upon you for the Time and as you make your Apprentices a Part of your Family all the Duty you owe the rest of your Family you owe to them both as to their Souls and Bodies except such as relate to Estate which is peculiar to Children I need not tell you your Duty but I'll tell you what I understood by putting my Child into your Hands if you please  Ma  Well  What's that  Fa  Why  I understood that I put him entirely under your Government  in the first Place  and under your Care  in the second  that this Government respected  first  the Authority of your Command which was to be a perfect  Supersedeas  to mine even so much that if I had commanded  him one thing and you another that interfer'd with it his obeying you was not to be counted a disobeying me  For Example  if I commanded him to meet me at any Place or Time were the Occasion ever so great if you commanded him to stay at home he ought to neglect my Command and obey yours which contradicted it  his Time  being yours and not mine and this I always told him and therefore charg'd him never to come to me without asking you leave  Ma  This is all very just and I believe he has always done so  Fa  Then Sir Secondly  as I put him entirely under your Government suspending my own Authority over him  as a Father  it becomes a necessary Consequence of it that I entirely committed him to your Care both Soul and Body how could this be otherwise Since as I reserv'd no Power to command him so I had of course remov'd him from my Inspection  Ma  Well  and do I not discharge this Duty by acquainting you of his ill Courses  Fa  No not at all Sir  for I may indeed take upon me to caution and advise him and shew my Dislike of his Conduct but the Power and Authority of warning him instructing him reproving him restraining him and if need be of correcting him  is all yours  Ma  Those Things are out of Doors long ago  prethee do you think  I'll trouble my self with my Apprentices at that rate  No no  not I I never struck a Servant in my Life and if I should who do you think would stay with me Apprentices  now a days  are not like what they were when you and I were Apprentices now we get a Hundred Pound or Two or Three Hundred Pound a Piece with them they are too high for Reproof and Correction  Fa  I know not what Custom may have done Sir to alter the Practices of Masters and their Apprentices but I am sure the Rule is not alter'd  the Duty  of a Master to Servants and of Servants to their Masters  is still the same  Ma  We don't trouble our Heads with those Things  now  Fa  I am sorry for it  you know best how then you can answer to God for the Souls committed to your Charge do you think every Religious Parent when he puts his Child Apprentice to you does not reckon that he commits his Soul to your Care as well as his Body  Ma  I do not say but  in the Nature of the thing  it should be so  but as  I told you  we do not understand it so  nowadays  Fa  I assure you I understood it so when I put my Son Apprentice to you and I hope you will understand it so too or else you will neither act like a Friend or like a Christian  Ma  Why  do I not act like  both  now in giving you an Account of this Piece of your Son's Behaviour that you may enquire into it  Fa  I allow your giving me an Account of it and thereby an Opportunity to join my Enquiry and Assistance with you to reform any thing amiss  is Friendly  but we are upon another Point now  which is this  That you think by this you discharge your Part that the Duty lies upon me now and you have no more to do and this I can by no means allow  Ma  Why  what would you make of me must I be a Father and Master too  Fa  No question of it  he is under your Family Care  as to his Body he is your Servant  but as to his Soul  I think  he is as much your Son as any Child you have and I cannot acquit you of  the Obligation and Duty of a Parent to your Servants do you discharge your Conscience of it how you please  Ma  Why  what would you have me Catechise and Instruct my Apprentices as if they were my Children Then I must turn Schoolmaster I hope you have done that already and I think it ought to be supposed all Parents have done that before they put their Children Apprentices they do not put them Apprentices to learn Religion but to learn their Trades  Fa  It is true they do not put their Children Apprentices to learn Religion but neither do they put them Apprentices  to lose their Religion  and to have all the Pains their Parents have taken with them sunk again There is a kind of Instruction subsequent to Catechisms and Examinations  there are kinds  of Instructions suited to the Age and Circumstances and such an Instructor every Master of a Family ought to be to his Servants as well as to his Children  Ma  I do not understand what Instruction you mean  Fa  Why  suppose your own Children were grown up past saying their Catechise would you think your Duty of instructing them ceased Is there nothing for a Parent to say to his Children after he has done with Questions and Answers  Ma  That may be as he sees the Occasion  if they take ill Courses  Fa  Why  is there no previous Advice to be given no Cautions to avoid Company no Exhortations to preserve Virtue and to behave soberly and modestly No pressing them to their Duty to God and to avoid those Sins that will ruin their Souls Is not this a Duty upon us all to our Children  Ma  Yes  but would you have me do this to Apprentices too  Fa  Most certainly  especially when you take Apprentices that you know were religiously educated and  on whom  such things are likely to make due Impressions and I must own if you do not I think you do not discharge the Duty of a Master for a Master is a  PARENT  tho' he is not a  Father  Ma  You have no Scripture for this in the whole Bible  Fa  Suppose that were true  the Nature of the Thing is so plain that there needed no particular Scripture to command it in express Terms and yet you will find Scripture enough for it too in the Examples of good Men particularly in  Joshua  who resolv'd to serve the Lord  he  and  his House  And how could that be if he did not instruct or command his Servants to do so  David  says a Lyar shall not dwell with him What is more plain than that he resolved to correct the irreligious Behaviour of his whole Houshold as well Servants as Children and to turn away those who were incorrigible But the Fourth Commandment puts it cut of Question and is express in the Case of the keeping the Sabbath mark the Words  In it thou shalt do no manner of Work THOƲ  there's the Master's Duty for himself The next Part is his Duty in seeing that his Family shall perform it as well as himself  NOR thy Son NOR thy Daughter  there's his Duty as a Father  NOR thy Man Servant NOR thy Maid Servant  there's his hired Servants  NOR the Stranger in  is within thy Gates  there are his Apprentices And what's the Meaning of this Word  NOR  but this Thou shalt do no manner  of Work  NOR  permit or suffer thy Son or thy Daughter or thy Servants to do any  This Commandment expresly declares that the Servants are subjected to the Master's Command in matters relating to their Duty to God and that Masters are oblig'd to see that their Servants perform it  Ma  Indeed you have said something in this that is new to my Thoughts and seems to give an Authority to what you say I confess I never consider'd that Part of it before but what can I do If I should go about this Work with my Servants they would laugh at me it would make me ridiculous  Fa  If you are to be laugh'd out of your Duty by your Servants I am sorry for it you are very ill qualified then to be a Master I hope and am perswaded my Son would not be one of them  Ma  I know not whether he would or no I find him not the most complying particularly in my Enquiry about this matter which I now tell you of it was a long time before he would own where he spent his Time and now he has told me I have no Account of what he has been about or what his Business was there at those unseasonable Hours  Fa  This is the very Thing I complain of  Ma  Why  how shall I help it  What would you have me do  Fa  Do I would have you act like a Master and oblige him to do as becomes a Servant  viz  give you an exact Account of his Behaviour His Time is yours and you ought to know how he spends it if any of his Time is employ'd out of your Business you ought to exact an Account of it from him how it has been disposed of as much as  you would of Money that you had trusted him with how he had paid it  Ma  I thought this more your Work than mine  Fa  If he was your own Son and my Apprentice I should think so too  but as it is  as I said before his Time is not mine nor his own but yours and 'tis to you he is to give an Account of it  Ma  But pray  why do you put it off from your self You know I have a great hurry of Business and cannot have Time and he will be more in Awe of you than of me I think it is much better for you  Fa  I am very far from putting it off from my self I shall concur with you most readily in the strictest Examination into his Behaviour but I am surpriz'd to hear you put it off from your self as if you were not concern'd in it and by which if his Courses are evil as you suggest he may be ruined at any time and I may know nothing of it and you must allow that this ought to give me some Concern as a Father whatever it does to you as a Master  Ma  I am something of your Mind now as to its being my Duty to my Servants tho' as I am circumstanc'd I do not see how I can perform it  Fa  If God gives you a Sense of its being your Duty I leave the Sense of your living in the Neglect of it to his Mercy who I hope will open your Eyes to the Necessity of performing it it is a sad Thing to be in such a Circumstance as renders what is your known Duty impracticable to you  Ma  What can I do  Fa  That is for you to consider not me if you are convinc'd of what you ought to do I have spent my Time well enough  Ma  But what would you have me do with your Son  Fa  Do Act the Master with him and command him to give you an exact Account of the Time you charge him with where he has spent it in what Company and about what Business  Ma  If I do he will refuse it and desire me to dismiss him he does as good as do that already which I took ill from him  Fa  What must be the Occasion of that  Ma  Why it had been observ'd by all the House as well as by me that he has been melancholly and discontented a great while and I very kindly ask'd him the Reason but he declined to tell me I asked him if he disliked the Trade he said  NO  if he dislik'd his Master  NO  I told him if he was uneasie at any thing tho' he was bound I would release him for I would not keep him against his Inclination at this he seem'd pleased and mighty desirous to go now what can I do If I challenge him with his going out and pretend to demand a strict Account of his time and he refuses what can I do but threaten to turn him away and that it seems he desires and yet he will not tell me the Reason of it neither which does not shew him to have much good Nature or good Manners Indeed I took it so ill that but in Respect to you I had sent him Home that very Minute and now I have told you of it what would you have me do  Fa  I have said what I would have you do  viz  act the Master with him and tell him in plain terms you will have an Account of his Behaviour you may be sure he shall get nothing by complaining to me if his Case be bad and if he refuses positively as I believe he will not we will enquire of your Neighbour Mr  's  for he has the  Character of a very good Man perhaps he may find it out for us  Ma  I know Mr  's  is a very pious religious good Man and his Wife is a very religious Woman and 'tis indeed a very sober Family which makes me wonder what the Boy can be doing there which he should be so earnest to conceal if you will I'll go and enquire of him  first  Fa  No  I think you had better talk with the Boy  first  I am perswaded he will submit to you and I hope tell you the Truth and if that Truth be to your Satisfaction you will be better pleased to have it from the Boy than to make it more publick  Ma  Well I will have another Dialogue with him to Morrow and you shall hear what will be the Issue  The Father goes away and the Youth coming to the Door with him the Father says thus  Fa  Thomas  It seems your Master has been talking with you about this Matter  Son  Yes Sir  Fa  He is very angry and takes it very ill you should refuse to give him an Account of your self and where you used to be when you go out in a Morning and Evening  Son  I did tell him where I was and assured him I was no where else  Fa  But it was a long time before you would tell him that  Son  I was so afraid he would enquire what my Business was there that I could not think of telling him  Fa  Why you must tell him still  Child  for he is mighty earnest to know what you are there  so much for he imagines it is some wicked thing by your being afraid to tell him I hope the Account you gave me of it is true  Son  Dear Father  I hope you do not doubt its being true I never used to tell you an Untruth  Fa  No Child  I do not doubt of its being true and why then should you be afraid to tell him of it  Son  I am more asham'd than afraid to tell him of it I think it does not become me to make my Master blush at himself  Fa  But here is a Necessity now so that I do not see how you can avoid it let him take it how he will for it passes in the Family that you have some ill Correspondence or some bad Company there and they will make a great deal of it if you are so backward to give an Account of it and therefore to clear up your own Reputation you must tell your Master  Son  I had rather you would do it for me Sir I am not fit to talk to my Master about such things  Fa  I have prepar'd the way by a long Dispute with your Master about his Duty to his Servants and I am perswaded let what you say be never so course or Boyish God will bless it so as to carry Conviction along with it that he has not done his Duty to you whatever you have done to him  Son  I can say nothing to him of that  Sir  he will fly out in a Rage at me  Fa  No no  you are only to answer his Questions and give an Account of your self and of the Reason why you go over to the Clothier's House every Morning and Evening you can do that easily enough let the Will of God be done in what shall follow one Way or other  Son  I will do as you order me  Sir  as well as I can  The Father leaves him and the Boy going in his Master calls him  Ma  Thomas  come hither  Tho  Yes Sir  Ma  Well  I have given your Father an Account of your Behaviour and he is very much concern'd as well as I about it  Tho  I am sorry for it Sir  Ma  Well  but that is not enough your Father and I too are resolv'd to find out the Bottom of it if you will not confess ingenuously  Tho  Sir you speak of it as if I was guilty of some strange thing I hope I have committed no Crime Sir  Ma  It will be very well if it appears so Sir however our Suspicions are justified by your being so very careful to conceal your self and if this has made me resolve to examine into it you might save me that Labour  as I told you  by an ingenuous Confession  Tho  I never declin'd it  Sir  Ma  No Did I not press you to it before and you declin'd it and your Father's coming prevented or else I suppose I had had a flat Denial  Tho  I never denied to obey any of your Commands  Sir  in my Life I only told you that I was backward because I fear'd it might displease you but I little thought it should be suggested that my being abroad was for any thing criminal  Ma  How could you expect any other  Tho  Because being perfectly innocent I had no thought of being suspected  Ma  Clear up all then  Thomas  by ingenuously giving an Account of your self to me now  Tho  Be pleased Sir to tell me what Part you mean whether as to my being abroad or my being discontented for you charg'd me with both  Ma  Begin  first  with your being abroad  you say  you were only at my Neighbour's over the  Way I have not examin'd into it yet but I take it for granted that you speak Truth  Tho  Indeed  Sir  I was no where but there  Ma  Well your Business there the Occasion of your going so early how you employ'd your self there and with who  These are the Questions  Tho  You will not take it ill  Sir  I hope then if my Answers may seem not to become me or less dutiful or respectful to you than you may think they ought to be  Ma  Not at all  so you speak Truth  Thomas  Tho  I hope I shall satisfie you of that Sir by the Consequence  You know Sir  I have been brought up under my Father with a Religious Education and in his Family where the Worship of God has been constantly kept up and coming hither  Sir  as an Apprentice where I found you were not pleas'd to permit me or to let me come up when you  I doubt not  went to Prayers and reading with your Family it made me afraid either that you did not think me worthy to be reckon'd one of your Family or that it was a Judgment of God upon me to be shut out from his Worship this Sir made me very sad which is the Discontent you speak of but hearing of that other good Family over the Way and that Mr  's  the Clothier went constantly to Prayers every Morning and Night I got Acquaintance with the Youngman his Apprentice and got him to ask his Master to give me leave to come there at those Times  Ma  Well Thomas  this is a well contriv'd Story truly you want not Cunning I find but what is this to Six a Clock in the Morning  Thomas  which at this time of the Year is always before Day and before he is up to be sure  Tho  If you please to enquire  Sir  into the Orders of his Family you will find that he is up every Morning in the Year by Six a Clock and calls them all to Prayers before they go to work  Ma  And what mean you by getting that Boy to do this for you That does not hang together at all  Why  he is the most profligate young Villain that ever came into any good Man's House His Master was talking in my Hearing but the other Day of sending him to the House of Correction and spoke to me for a Warrant your Acquaintance with such a Boy as that is not likely to be for so good a Purpose and this Part makes all the rest unlikely and to be suspected  Tho  He was so  Sir that is true but if you enquire you will find he is another thing now God's Grace has made a strange Change in that Boy in a few Weeks past if you please to inform your self of it Sir you may hear it from other Hands  Ma  And is this the whole Truth  Thomas  Has this been your whole Business there  Tho  Indeed it has Sir  Ma  You must not think much if I enquire in order to be better satisfied  Tho  I cannot expect any other Sir  Ma  I shall talk with you farther about it it is late now  The Master bitterly stung with the Boy's Account of himself puts off the rest of the Discourse  The End of the Third Dialogue  Notes  on the Third Dialogue  THERE seems to be more Circumlocutions in this Dialogue than in any of the rest but they will be found not useful only but necessary at least to preserve the Cadence of Things and introduce the Substance of the real Story by necessary Gradations the Boy's shifting off so many Ways before he directly tells his Master the whole of his Business Is a Mark of commendable Modesty in a Servant his Shyness of speaking what he knew touch'd his Master's Behaviour more than his own may be very instructing to Servants if they please to mark it in Things where their Master's Character may be concern'd  But above all  it may be noted that all these Things tend to bring the Conviction home with the more Energy and Force upon the Conscience of the Master  The Master's Discourse with the Young Man's Father contains a great many useful Hints about the Duty of Masters to their Servants That they ought to reckon them under their Care as well as under their Government That the Charge of the Souls of our Servants lies upon us as well as those of our Children the just Distinction between a PARENT and a FATHER is fruitful of many useful Observations  the last  is tied by Nature  the first  by the God of Nature  the last  by Affection  the first  by Duty  but both  are tied to discharge the Part of a Christian Parent to the Souls under their Charge whether Servants Children or Relations That a Servant taken  into the Family becomes a Child of the Family and ought equally with our Children to partake of every Part of our Religious Duties such as Prayer Exhortation Examination Instruction Reproof Restraint and Correction This is farther plain from what God says of  Abraham  Genesis  That he will command his Children and his Houshold  that is He will discharge faithfully the Duty of a Parent or Guide and Governor of a Family which is shown in his commanding his whole House to walk in the Ways of God  Note  How Custom has wickedly of late years seem'd to discharge Masters of this Duty    By the Pride of Servants  who bringing large Sums of Money much greater than formerly seem to expect not to be so much at Commands as they used to be A wicked and abominable Custom which as no Religious Parent can be easie in it so no Religious Master ought to be subjected to it  By the Negligence of Parents who really seem less to concern themselves about the Souls of their Children when they put them out as Apprentices than about their learning Trades doing their Business  and the like  By the universal Backwardness of Masters who think  as this Man did  that they have no Concern upon them about their Servants Souls or any thing but just to see that their Business is done and then to let them go where they please and do what they please  Observe here a most ridiculous Argument or Excuse which the Master brings  viz  That he was asham'd to go about instructing  or praying with his Apprentices and Journeymen because  they would laugh at him  Note we are easier to be laugh'd OUT OF our Duty than perswaded INTO IT  From the whole  Masters of Families may observe the Duty of instructing and religiously guiding their Servants lies indispensably upon them as much as that of instructing and educating their Children They are  PARENTS  that is  Guides  and  Governors  to their whole House tho' they are  FATHERS  only to  their Children  The Fourth DIALOGUE  THE  Master  of the Young Man aforesaid now makes a Visit to his Neighbour the Clothier who lived over against his House whether he had any doubt of the Truth of what the Boy had said to him and had a Mind  as he had said to the Lad himself  to find out the bottom of it or perhaps to satisfie himself farther about the Alteration of the wicked Boy which his own Servant had acquainted him of or to please his own Curiosity or directed by Providence for his farther Conviction  is not material  but here discoursing of other Things with the good Man and his Wife he begins the following Dialogue  thus  talking of their Servants  I Remember Neighbour you were once complaining of a very bad Servant you had and talk'd as if you wanted a Warrant of me to send him to the House of Correction  Clothier  Yes an't please your Worship I did so  Note He was an Alderman in the Country Town and so a Magistrate at that time  Aderman  Well and pray how does he behave himself now Shall you want a Warrant Neighbour  You know I shall always be ready to serve you in any thing I can it shall cost you nothing if you have any such Occasion  Clo  I hope not now Sir I think that Lad is much reformed tho' I have had many bad Servants I never had a worse than he was but he is wonderfully changed  however  I thank your Worship for your kind Offer  Clo  Wife  You are very happy  Sir  in that Part for you have very good Servants  Ald  Truly  but indifferent  I have had my share of Trouble that way as well as you  Wife  I am sure you have some very good ones  Ald  Well  but I am very glad to hear that your bad one is mended  Clo  I thank you  Sir  indeed he is very much mended  Ald  It is very rare that bad Servants grow better I have often heard of good Servants that have grown worse I am sure with me they do so  Clo  Indeed Sir  I hope this Lad of mine will prove a very good young Man  Ald  Good Why you represented him to me as one of the worst Wretches that ever came into your House if I remember right you said he was given to Lying and Swearing Scoffing at Religion and at every thing that was good and was himself every thing that was bad  Clo  Indeed he was so Sir  Ald  I doubt not you did all you could to reclaim him I know you would  Clo  I endeavoured  Sir  to discharge my Conscience towards him but I had no Satisfaction in it  only so far  that I had done my Duty I could do no more and I was quite tir'd out with him indeed I resolved to put him away for I could not  bear him among my Children he was enough to spoil all the Children in the Parish  Ald  You have a great Advantage  Neighbour  that I have not I am in such a continual hurry of Business that I cannot look after my Family as I would do I have no Leisure to discharge my Duty to my Servants you have Leisure Neighbour and your Servants have the Advantage of it  Clo  Truly Sir  If I have Leisure it is my Loss for my Livelyhood depends upon my being employed as well as my Servants but they that are taught to know their Duty will always find Leisure to do it  I doubt not  Sir but you discharge your self better that way than I can do  Wife  It is seen plainly in your Servants themselves that you do your Duty to them Sir sure never any body had such Servants as you have  Ald  Nay Neighbour  do not say I discharge my Duty better than you  God forgive me  I don't discharge it at all I mean to my Apprentices I take no Care about them  Clo  Wife That is then  because they are so good and so religious that they need no Inspection  for you know Sir  we are to instruct our Servants as well as our Children  Ald  Well I cannot say that I have made that much of my Concern for our Apprentices generally come of pretty good Families and bring Money with them and they think themselves above being talk'd to about such things  Clo  Then they are among those who  Solomon  calls Fools that Despise Instruction and if they reject your Offers to instruct them I cannot see what you can do in that Case That was my very Case with this Boy  Ald  I perceive you have had a great deal of Trouble with him  Clo  Yes indeed so I have I was quite weary of him  Ald  He had the Report of a very wicked Boy  Clo  Indeed I was asham'd to have it said such a Boy was in my House I was afraid any of the Neighbours Children should come near him  Ald  Indeed I have a Young Man I believe is not much the better for him I have been chiding him a little about it But is he really chang'd and reform'd think you  Clo  Indeed that he is  and most wonderfully too  I bless God for it  Ald  I question not but you have taken a great deal of Pains with him but are you not deceiv'd Is he not a Cheat and plays the Hypocrite  Clo  If ever there was a true Convert in the World I believe he is one  Ald  You are very happy that God has so far bless'd your Endeavours with the Child  Clo  Wife  Not our Endeavours  Sir  at all we were denied that Blessing it comes all from you Sir the Blessing is from your House  Ald  What do you mean  Clo  It is a plain Case Sir  Clo  Wife  If I understand you right you spoke as if some of your Servants had received no good from our  William If that be so I know not  but I am sure  William  has received Good from some in your House  Ald  Yes indeed  I found that a young Lad I have newly bound was acquainted with this Boy of yours And that he was often abroad with him and it has caused some Disturbance among us for knowing your Lad was so wicked a Boy I forbid him his Company  Clothier  Pray what do you call the Lad you Speak of  Ald  His Name is  Thomas  he is my youngest Prentice  Clo  Wife  I know not what Harm he may have received from our Boy  but I can assure you  our Youth has received much Good from him  Clo  Ay that's the Youth that GOD has made the Instrument He is a wonderful Child  Ald  He the Instrument How's that possible  Clo  With GOD  Sir  all Things are possible Assure your self Sir so it is And such a Convert as this Child is I neither ever saw or read of  Ald  Why our  Thomas  is a poor melancholly discontented Boy a meer Child  Clo  He is such a Child  Sir  as I never met with the like I find you do not know him  Ald  Why  I never thought there was any thing in him he is but young and indeed we all thought him young in every Thing it is true He is a sober modest Sort of a Boy and talks pretty well but I never saw any thing extraordinary in him he is so melancholly and discontented we thought him distemper'd and I have been at the Point of turning him away  Clo  You know Sir  the Scripture says That  out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings he has ordained Praise  this Child  as you call him  is an excellent Christian and beyond his Years capable of shewing it Perhaps Sir you never tried him  Ald  No indeed  not I  as I said to you before Neighbour I have no Time to trouble my self about my Prentices I mean as to such Things  Clo  Wife  And  as I said to you before Sir  You have no need for it for your Prentices are fit to Teach others  Ald  I am glad to hear it is so but I confess you surprize me with the Thing how are you satisfied with the Truth of these Things  Clo  My Wife can give you an Account of the whole Matter if your Worship pleases to have Patience to hear it  Ald  I'll hear it  with all my Heart  Here the M  stress relates the whole Passage and the Discourse between her and the young Man in the Room over the Workhouse  Ald  I am amazed at this Account you give but Pray tell me was all this begun by his keeping Company and conversing with my young Man  Clo  Yes  all of it  he was the general Mocker of every Thing that was good and began to do so in your young Man's Company and he was the first that reproved him for it And he did it so seriously and so effectually that it has pleased GOD to work on him  as you see  Ald  Then  I have done that young Man of mine a great deal of Wrong  Clo  Wife  If you have thought any Evil of him  you have wronged him indeed  for he is such a young Man as will be a Blessing to any Family he comes into  Ald  Indeed I have wronged him very much  especially  if you can give me Satisfaction about one Thing and which to be free with you was the Principal Reason of my coming to visit you at this Time  Clo  We will give you all the Satisfaction we can Sir  Ald  Why then  I'll tell you  That  first  as said before I have had some Uneasiness at my young Man's keeping  Company as I was informed he did with this Boy  who I had heard you say was so wicked that ye knew not what to do with him and talked of sending him to the Correction House  but this was not all  I found my Young Man grew Melancholy and appeared discontented  as I told you just now  as if he did not like his Business tho' we cannot say that he omits or neglects any Thing but every Morning before Day he rises up in the Dark and goes out some where or other and stays about half an Hour and then comes in again and sits by himself all the rest of the Time till Business begins every Night he is missing again till about a Clock and all the House takes Notice of it when I came to examine him about it it was a long time before he would give me an Account of it Nay he rather desired to be put away and go back to his Father than to give an Account where he spent his Time till at last I acquainted his Father with it and threatned him I would find out the Bottom of it unless he would make an ingenious Confession then he gives this for an Answer that he was over the way at your House here This increased my Suspicion because of the Hours he kept which I was sure must be in the Morning before you were up and I concluded this wicked Boy of yours and he spent their Time together in some clandestine Wickedness or other and the Boy would be ruin'd which I was very sorry for his Father being my very good Friend  Clo  I hope Sir you need not be apprehensive that he should get any ill in my House  Ald  No indeed  Neighbour  I should not so far as you know of it but what could their Mornings Meetings be for before you or your Family was up  Clo  Wife  What Time is it exactly  Sir  that you say he comes and goes  Ald  As I understand it he goes out about Six and is back between Six and Seven which looked  to me as if he came hither before you were up and assoon as he found you beginning to stir comes off again and would not be seen  Clo  That cannot be the Case  Sir  for we are all of us up every Day if we are well before Six and at our Work presently after Six  Ald  Well  But does he come at those Hours in the Morning and about Eight a Clock at Night is he here as he tells me or is he not  Clo  Yes  I cannot deny but the Young Man is here at these Hours very often  Ald  Nay  if you do but know of it I am easie to be satisfied especially if this had been his Business  Clo  Wife  I hope your Worship will not be angry with us for the young Mans coming hither  Ald  Not at all  if you are assured what his Business is  Clo  It is not for us to say we are satisfied he is your Servant  Sir  and if you are not satisfied I should be very sorry to have him come hither against your Mind  Ald  I say  if you are satisfied that his coming hither has been as you relate it and that he has been a means of doing the Young Man so much Good I shall be satisfied to be sure but what need is there of his coming so early in a Morning and so late at Night that indeed I do not understand it seems to leave me in the Dark a little and this makes me ask if you are sure of the Thing  Clo  I will by no means deceive you  Sir  you do not rightly understand us That our Lad has been instructed and brought to a Conviction and as I believe and hope to a thorough Conversion by his conversing with the Young Man that is your Servant  this is true Sir  there is no Room to doubt it but that his coming over hither Night and Morning is to converse with our Lad  William  that is not the Case at all Sir I hope the Young Man did not tell you so if he did I should be sorry I can hardly suspect him of such a Thing I believe he makes more Conscience of his Words  than to say so  Ald  No indeed I will not do him so much wrong  he did not say so  but when first I asked him where he had been he told me he had been no where but here I told him if that were true it was well and I should ask no further of his Business till I was satisfied about the Fact it self  Clo  Wife  I should ha' thought it very strange if he had told you so their Conversation has not been here I can assure you but as I understand it has been at your House or walking in the Fields or at such Times as  you know  Youth can find enough to converse in  Ald  What then can his Business be here  Clo  And your Worship will not be angry  Ald  Not I indeed  I am satisfied he can have been doing no Harm here and  if he had  I shall but dismiss him and let his Father take him to Task it is no Business of mine he is not my Son  Clo  You mistake me again I did not mean angry with him but angry with us  Ald  What should I be angry with you for  Clo  Perhaps you may think hard of us That we should do any Thing where your Family Affairs are concerned or speak our Minds too freely I am very sure we have shown no Disrespect to you in it Sir in the least  Ald  I give you my Word I will take nothing ill from you  do but  tell me freely the whole Case the making me easie in one Respect shall fully make me amends for any Thing you shall say that may concern me  Clo  Why then Sir  the Case is this  when my Wife heard from our Lad what she has already related to you and had examined  William  more fully about the Particulars as how and upon what Occasion he became acquainted with your Young Man in what Manner he had discoursed with him and what Principles of Instruction he had laid in him  William  gave her a long Account of the Conference they had had together and how  Thomas  gave him a Bible and turned down the several Promisory Texts to encourage him to hope in and pray to GOD and  Here the Clothier repeats the first Dialogue between the Two Boys so far as belonged to  William's  Case  And when we heard all this  you cannot think it strange  that we desired to see and speak with this young Man  to see  what kind of Youth it must be to whom GOD had so early given so much Grace and so eminently made an Instrument of to work on his Companion And meerly to satisfie this Curiosity my Wife ordered  William  to invite him hither  which he did  And brought him over with him I hope your Worship does not blame us for this it was with no Design at all but to see and talk with him upon serious Matters and see whether there was that Foundation in him which our Lad related  Ald  I cannot take any Thing of this ill I am very well pleased with it  pray go on  Clo  After we had talked a while with him on these Things he went home again we did not detain him at all but my Wife invited him to come again at his Leisure which he did this we hope you will not be displeased with for we are much taken with his Society  Ald  I am not at all displeased  Clo  In one of these Visits the young Man appeared more melancholy and more reserved as we thought than usual and my Wife pressed to know if any Thing troubled him or if he was not well He answered he was very well but modestly declined telling what troubled him  Ald  Why this is his Case  at Home  he appears reserved and discontented and no Body can get it out of him what is the Matter with him  Clo  Well my Wife got it out of him  some time after  when pressing him to tell her what it was that troubled him he told her his Case was very sad his Master was a good Man and he liked his Business very well but that his Master looked upon him as a Heathen or as some vile Creature for that Morning and Evening when he went up as he supposed to Prayers with his Children he would never let him be called up or admitted among them so that he said he believed his Master thought him not worthy taking any care of or else it was a Judgment of GOD upon him for his Sins and this troubled him so he could not enjoy himself and the poor Child wept grievously when he had told it her  Now Sir  as this relates to your Family Affairs I was very unwilling to mention it least you should be angry  Ald  Go on  I have no Reason to be angry at all neither at you nor at him  Clo  We could not but pity the poor Young Man and my Wife exhorted him however to take Care to be the more diligent in his private Duty to GOD and not to let the want of Family Prayer be a Means to thrust out Prayer altogether At this Discourse he wept again more than before and told her that he had no Retreat for private Prayer and that when at first he did kneel down  by his Bed side to pray to GOD when he went to Bed the other Apprentices would laugh at him jeer him and interrupt him so that he was forced to leave it off again that he was afterwards tempted to believe that having these Hinderances he was discharged from the Duty and having no Conveniencies for it was a just Excuse for omitting it and the Fear that he should grow loose and willing to omit his Duty entirely opprest his Mind so that he thought it would break his Heart For he thought his Father had placed him just in the Devil's Mouth  I am too plain Sir  I hope you will excuse me  Ald  You need no Excuse  Pray go on  Clo  I was exceedingly concerned for the Young Man and so was my Wife and we were both minded to have invited him to come over at our usual Hours of Family Prayer and join with us but as he was your Worship's Servant and we did not know how our Hours might interfere with your Business we thought it was not proper lest it might give you Offence  Ald  Well  that was very obliging too  but I  should have taken no Offence I assure you  Clo  Then you will take the less Sir at what has been done which was only this The Young Man finding we did not invite him which it seems he expected spoke afterwards to  William  to ask my Wife if we would give him Leave when he might be spared to come over at our Times of Worship and join with us in Praying to GOD Then indeed we thought our selves more obliged  than we were before  to do it and my Wife sending for him told him she had invited him before but that we thought it might give his Master Offence but that he should be welcome to come when he would leaving it to him to take care that he did  not offend his Master by being out at such times as he might be wanted  withal  telling him that she believed he could not be here at our Morning Prayer because our Business requiring us to be early at Work we went always to Prayer exactly at Six a Clock in the Morning in Winter and at Five in Summer The Poor Young Man was so glad of the Liberty we had given him to come that he said he would be sure to be here by Six or Five if we begin so soon tho' he was to sit up all Night and indeed we have observed that he has never mist one Morning yet  Ald  And is all this true Is this his Business here Night and Morning  Clo  Wife  Indeed this is all Sir that we know of I hope it does not displease you  Ald  As  Judah  said of his Daughter  Tamar He is more Righteous than I  He has done his Duty and I have neglected mine I am sorry I have done him so much Wrong in my Thoughts I shall love the Boy for it as long as I live  Clo  But Sir  since you have given me Leave to speak so freely to your Worship and have had this long Account from me which I assure you is nothing but Truth will you please to give me Leave to put in one Word of my own in Behalf of this good Young Man  Ald  What is that  Speak freely  Clo  Why Sir  That you will be pleased to admit him to your Family Exercises tho' you do not the rest of your Servants I know you have a great Family and you may not think it proper to call them all up when as the Young Man says you do your Lady and Children but this is so good and so serious a Child that you will be delighted in having him with you and if you should not it will break his Heart and then besides he will  have no Occasion to come over to us or to rise at such Hours as he is not used to and perhaps get cold and many Things may happen to him I intreat for him purely because I see what a Child he is  Here the Master is pincht hard and for a Time sits silent at last breaks out  Ald  Alas Neighbour it is all wrong the Boy's mistaken and you are mistaken it is I alone am justly reproved in all this for like a Heathen and one that has entirely cast off GOD and Religion I have never kept up any Family Worship at all I confess it to you freely and I think in all my Life I have never had such a Stroke to my Conviction as from this poor Boy I have neither been Father nor Master to my Family but have been driving after the World as if I had no other Portion I have lived as if I were never to die and I am afraid I shall die as if I had never lived the whole Crime lies at my Door  The Alderman weeps  Clo  I am sorry I have said so much I knew nothing how it was  The End of the Fourth Dialogue  The Fifth DIALOGUE  THE Discourse of the good Man and his Wife had such an Effect upon the Country Alderman especially with the Addition from the Account he had received of the Conduct of his Apprentice that it caused him seriously to reflect on his Family Conduct and convinc'd him that he had been quite out of the Way of his Duty as a Master of his Family to his Servants as well as in his Relation of a Father to his Children and these Convictions put him upon Resolutions of altering his Conduct in his Family  But here as in all such Cases where a Religious Oeconomy is not established in the Beginning insuperable Difficulties appeared to him which several Times discouraged him slackned his Resolution and cooled his Mind so as to incline him rather to go on in the Neglect as he had begun believing it too late to refrain But two unexpected providential Accidents surprized him into his Duty the happy Consequences whereof will appear for the Encouragement of other Masters of Families in the like Attempt of reforming their Practice and applying themselves to set up a Religious  Government in their Housholds notwithstanding all pretended Difficulties  The Difficulties he had before him were Two First he had married a Lady who differed from him in Opinion he had been bred a Dissenter from the Church and his Wife had been bred in Conformity to the Church and continued so And as this Kind of marrying however not at all unlawful is not always the greatest Help to or forwarder of a Religious Family so he tho' erroneously judged his Wife might not be willing to join with him in his Way of Family Worship if he should begin it  Again  as to his Servants his Apprentices and Journymen several of which he had were  Men grown  such as seemed to be past Government and as they had none of them any appearing Inclination to what was Religious he having always indulged them in a total Neglect of such Things he thought they would but make a Jest of him and that he should never be able to bring them to conform to any Thing of Family Orders As to his Children they were Young and he did not so much consider them in the Case And those that were any Thing grown up were abroad at the Boarding School Now in both these Cases he was happily disappointed Providence removed both the Difficulties at once so as to take from him any kind of Excuse for the further Neglect of his Duty  It soon became known in the House that  Thomas  and his Master had had some Words about his going out every Morning and Evening to the Clothiers nor could it be hid upon what Occasion he went thither and his Master had spoken of it to another of his Servants that the Young Man should not be hindred for that he was very well satisfied of the Business he went about As it  was known among the Servants it could not be concealed from the Mistress who being a very pious Religious Lady her self seem'd not a little concerned at the Thing and having observed her Husband to be more than usually thoughtful and melancholly for some Time She imagined something about that Apprentice had disturb'd him both which Circumstances put together occasioned the following Discourse betwixt them  Wife  My Dear  Pray let me ask one Thing of you have you examined any further since you and I discoursed last of it about your Youngest Apprentice keeping bad Hours  Husband  Yes  my Dear  I have but I do not find there is any Thing in it worth Notice  Wife  How do you mean  Nothing in it  It is certain he has a Haunt somewhere in the Town that he steals out in a Morning before Day and comes softly in again as if he were a Thief and every Evening as duly as it comes he is abroad no Body knows  where  Husb  My Dear  I have examined into it  Wife  Nay  if you are satisfied I do not use to meddle especially with  your  Servants but methinks it is great Pity the Boy should be ruined he was a pretty sober Lad when he came hither and if he takes any bad Courses now even for his Father's Sake as well as his own methinks something should be done to prevent it I wish you would have told his Father of it that he might have taken some Care of him  Husb  My Dear  There is nothing at all of Harm in the Boy Be satisfied  Wife  Nay I have thought so too but what can he go out so for then and at such Hours too  Husb  I have examined into it  I say  and am fully satisfied  Wsfe  Nay if I must not know the Case I will say no more  Husb  My Dear  I do not conceal the Case from the upon his Account at all  Wife  Well then  I suppose he has promised you Amendment  Husb  No indeed  so far from that that I have approved of his doing it and have allowed him to do it and ordered none of my People to hinder him as some would ha' done by taking the Keys of the Door in  Wife  I do not use to meddle I say with your Business but you may be sure the seeming Mystery of it tempts my Curiosity to know what the Meaning of it can be but if you do not think fit to tell me I shall desist my Enquiry  Husb  I cannot tell thee the Case  Wise  Cannot  that is still more dark it seems it is not because you do not know it  Husb  No indeed  my Dear  Wife  If it is some Secret I should not know  on the least Notice  my Enquiry shall cease  Husb  I never concealed any Thing from thee in my Life  Wife  Nor did I ever discover any Thing yet committed to me What have I done then that you begin now  Husb  I wish I had not this Secret to conceal it is a Burden too heavy for me  Wife  Then let me bear some of it for thee  my Dear  cannot I lighten the Load by taking some of it upon my self I would bear any Burden to remove it from you  Husb  This is a Load no body can bear a Wound no Surgeon can cure  Wife  You surprize me with the Nicety of the Thing and sweil my Apprehensions perhaps to  a greater Degree than it requires It must be something very mysterious that from the Conduct of a Boy can be so essential to you I intreat thee  my Dear  tell me so much of it as is proper for me to know  if any Part of it be so  or tell me that none of it is proper for me to know and I'll cease my Importunity  Husb  My Dear  it is all proper for you to know and I ought to let you know it and you both can and perhaps would assist to ease it and yet it is very difficult for me to let you know it  Wife  You leave me in the greatest Uncertainty now in the World whether I should importune you any further or not  Husb  I wish you would not and yet I wish you would  Wife  Whether would be most for your own Ease and Advantage for as for a meer satisfying my Curiosity I lay no Weight on that now  Husb  It would be most for my Advantage to have you know it  Wife  Then if you believe I have been faithful to you and can still be so put it in my Power to relieve you I have not been insensible that some thing has a good while oppress'd your Mind sure if I can relieve you your Remedy is easy  Husb  I do not say you can entirely relieve me but you may in Part  Wife  Let me do my Part then  Husb  My Part will be still hardest  Wife  My Dear  amuse me and your self no more what has this Boy done  Husb  My Dear he has done nothing which he ought not to have done and I nothing that I ought to have done he has strove to do his Duty and deeply reproved me that I have not done mine  Wife  He has shown more Honesty than Manners then  sure it was not his Place  to reprove his Master  Husb  No  my Dear  he has not reproved me in Words he hath rather used more Modesty in that than consisted with Truth but his Actions have given me the severest and most just Reproof that ever I had in my Life  Wife  Nay if you acknowledge it just  Husb  Or else it would be  an Insult  not a Reproof no Doubt it is just the Case is this You know I mentioned to you once before my Dissatisfaction at the Boy's Conduct and you gave me some Hints your self of his being melancholly and discontented upon which I acquainted his Father with it but his Father threw it back upon me to examine it my self and a long Dispute we had about whose Duty it was to take Cognizance of the Morals and Behaviour of Prentices  Wife  What could you dispute of about that  Husb  Why I alledged he was his Son that I could do no more than acquaint him with his Conduct and that he must take care of the rest that my Part was to teach him his Trade and see that my Business was done but as to the rest it lay upon him and that I had discharged my self in giving him this Account of his Son He affirmed the contrary that I was in his Place essentially that as I had a Right to his Time so I was obliged to exact an Account of it from him as much as I would of Money committed to him to pay  and the like  and so we fell into a long Dispute about the Distinction of a Parent and a Father he affirmed that I was a Parent to the Boy tho' not a Father and that the Duty of taking Care of him both Soul and Body was mine  Wife  I am not capable to argue these Things but I confess I must be very much of his Opinion for I think when a Father commits his Child to us if he puts his Body under our Care and not his Soul pray what must become of the Youth Must he be left without Government to be ruined  Husb  Why If that be my Duty I have sadly neglected it  Wife  Indeed  my Dear  I have often thought so especially when I have heard you say to your Prentices that you only required their constant Attendance at such and such Hours and that for the rest of the time they might go where they pleas'd I could not think Young Men should be left so entirely to their own Disposal I am perswaded no sober Father would like it I am sure if any of my Sons should come to be put out I should be very sorry to put them to a Master that should do so  Husb  I see I have been in an Error but what should I have done  Wife  My Dear  Why do you ask me what you should do Am I fit to teach you  Husb  Indeed any Body may teach me I have been taught lately by a meaner Instructor than you  Wife  It may be so  my Dear  but I am none of those Wives that set up to teach their Husbands  Husb  But you may give your Advice  Wife  In such Cases there is little Difference betwixt advising and teaching except in the Arrogance of the Word besides Advice is generally asked before it is given if it be given before it be asked it is rather an Admonition or Reproof than an Advice  Husb  But  my Dear  you might abate Ceremonies with me what would you have supposed to  have been my Duty as a Master Have not I enough to do to teach them their Trade and see them do my Business  Wife  If you will have it be so that I must give my Opinion I must be very plain that I think you have a great deal more to do that when they are committed to your Charge by their Parents their whole Behaviour is under your Care and that tho' serving God is their particular Duty and lies upon them yet it is your Duty to see  as far as in you lies  that they perform it and at your Hands their Souls will be required if you neglect  your Duty  and indulge them in the Neglect  of their own  Husb  But  my Dear  you must explain the words  as far as in me lies  that is the Thing I speak of my Business is their Work if they neglect that I am to see it remedied but as to their Morals and Religion if I see Cause to dislike I acquaint their Parents is not that doing the Thing as far as in me lies  Wife  I cannot say  that it is  you may do much more than that or else what does that signifie For when a Father knows of his Son's wicked Courses what can he do He is under your Care for Correction and under his Father's only for Admonition for he is your Servant  Husb  I warrant their Fathers would think it very hard that I should correct one of them  Wife  On the other Hand I believe you would take it very ill to have one of their Fathers come to your Shop and  cane  or  correct  one of your Prentices you would say he took the Work out of your Hands  Husb  I cannot take that Pains with them  I'll rather have no Apprentices  Wife  Indeed  my Dear  you had better take none for 'tis but murthering Youth and robbing their Fathers to take Young Men and then keep them under no Government  Husb  But Youth are come to that pass that they will be under no Government now  Wife  My Dear  there is hardly any Young Man so ill taught but if he is begun with at first will submit to Government I do not say they will all be the better for it but there is a great Difference hetween a Young Man's not profiting by Instruction and refusing to submit to it  Husb  My Dear  What can I do  Wife  My Dear  You are no ignorant Person you do not want to have me say what you can do you know what you ought to do it is not my Part to teach you your Duty  Husb  Abate that Nicety for once  my Dear  and make no Scruple to say what you think is my Duty to my Servants tho' you do not think it your Part to teach me my Duty you may be a Means to convince me that something was my Duty which I did not think was my Duty before and I may learn from you what you do not set up to teach there need not be so much Shyness between a Wife and her Husband that for Fear of taking too much upon you to teach me you should omit a kind Hint to me of what you think I ought to do  Wife  I do not refrain for that so much as that I think you know your Part so well that it is perfectly unreasonable and needless for me to offer any Thing besides Family Government is so natural a Consequence to the very Being and Constitution of Master and Servant Father and Child Husband and Wife that no Husband  of your Capacity  can be ignorant the Scripture is so  full on the Side of those who are to be governed that it cannot but lead directly to those who are the Governours Wives are bid to submit themselves to their Husbands Children to obey their Parents Servants to be Subject to their Masters all which naturally implies that the Government of the whole Family devolves entirely upon the Head of the Master who has the whole Charge of them Soul and Body and is accountable for their Miscarriages so far as those Miscarriages are owing to the Omission of his Duty  Husb  So that you put the Master entirely upon the Father's Place and the Servants in the Posture of Children  Wife  Indeed I can think no otherwise  especially Apprentices  who by their Indentures are entirely subjected to the Master's Government  Husb  But  My Dear  we differ then about the Word  Government  and how far that extends beyond my commanding them in the Offices of an Apprentice and their doing my Business  Wife  Indeed I think it extends to every thing else we are obliged by the Fourth Commandment not to suffer our Servants to break the Sabbath and so of every Duty in the other Commands and no Question but 'tis our Duty to restrain them from every evil Action whereby they may offend GOD or wrong their Neighbour I mean as much as is in our Power and on the other Hand we are to encourage them in all that is good  viz  in their Duty to GOD and Man and this by all possible Methods such as Exhortation Command Advice  viz  but especially Example praying to GOD for them and with them  Husb  If all this be my Duty I have sadly neglected it both to Servants and Children too  Wife  Indeed  my Dear  I have often thought so with a great deal of Grief  Husb  But why then  my Dear  would you not tell me so before now and not now without so much Difficulty and a kind of Violence  Wife  My Dear  I have been backward perhaps more than has been my Duty lest you should think I did what it was not my Place to do besides you know our Opinions differ in some Things and I did not know whether you might listen to me on that Account  Husb  Why  my Dear  that very Thing has been my Hindrance lest  my Dear  being of a different Opinion as to the Form of Prayer should not like it or care to join with me in it  Wife  You very much wronged me then  my Dear  I hope tho' we differ in Opinion about Religion we are not of two Religions we may have differing Thoughts of the Manner and Forms of Worship but not I hope of Worship it self I hope we pray to the same GOD and in the Name of the same Intercessor nor is our Difference about Forms such that you should refuse my Prayers because of the Form or I yours for want of a Form that GOD to whom we pray certainly respects the Heart and not the Form so that with the Form or without it we shall be equally heard if we pray in Faith and equally rejected if we do not  Husb  And would you have joined with me  my Dear  in Family Prayer if I had proferred it  Wife  Most heartily  my Dear  and I wonder what Kind of Heathen you have taken me for that you should doubt it I am sure it has often troubled me to see the Family brought up with no manner of Regard to the Worship of God in it I was never bred so and I have had many a sad Heart about it on the Account of my Children  Husb  And never would ease your Mind by speaking a Word about it to me before  Wife  That may have been a Fault but I did not so much think it my Duty or rather indeed did not see it likely to have Effect  Husb  But would you rather have your Children bred up without being introduced into the Ways of God and Religion than break in a little upon what you thought was not your Place  Wife  I have endeavoured to do my Duty with my little Ones as well as I could  Husb  And I have the Reputation  of that little too  as you shall hear presently which I am sure and God knows I do not deserve in the least  Wife  Alas  What can a Wife do in such a Family as ours is it is not worth naming The Worship of God in a Family ought to be avowed and owned by the Master of the Family and performed either by himself or Chaplains with due Gravity and Solemnity suitable to the Authority of the Master of the House and suitable to the Authority and Greatness of that God to whom it is directed and there is not a Servant so wicked so profligate so prophane but would reverence the Practice if they did not profit by the Performance  Husb  Truly  my Dear  one of the greatest Difficulties was on your Account and I have often thought it the only Allay to our Happiness in coming together  Wife  It is very hard you should think so ill of me and not try whether it was with Justice or no especially when your Information was so easy  Husb  I was loth  Wife  Loth to come to the Duty and he that tempted you to neglect that Part threw this wicked Thought in your Way for an Obstruction not giving you Leave to clear up your own  Thoughts and my Innocence by asking me the Question  Husb  Indeed I have done thee Wrong but I hope the Devil has had no Share in it  Wife  My Dear  How was it possible such a hard Thought could enter into thy Heart else of me Had I not a Religious Education And is not my Father and Mother still living who keep as regular a Family and the Worship of God as constantly performed in it as in any House in the Nation And have you seen any thing in me that looks like a Willingness to have my Family without it As to my scrupling to join with Dissenters tho' I think it my Duty not to break off from the Church yet sure I have not such an Opinion of conscientious Dissenters as to refuse to pray to God with them How could you think I would have married a Dissenter if that had been my Judgment And have you not seen me readily join in Family Worship at your Brother's as you have done with us at my Father's Surely if we have both joined with other Families of either Sort we could not have wanted Charity so much as to have refused to do it in our own House  Husb  Truly  my Dear  you argue so reasonably in this that I see plainly it has been all my own Crime and I have done thee a great deal of Wrong which I am very sorry for  Wife  If  my Dear  will reform the Thing it self the Wrong done to me shall never be mentioned as long as I live I have too much Grief at the Neglect not to bury all my Complaints in the Satisfaction I should have to see it rectified  Husb  If you knew the stinging Reproof I have had another Way you would say I wanted no other Animadversion  Wife  I have interrupted you too long in that pray let me hear it out if I remember you were upon the Discourse with  Thomas  's Father pray go on with that  Husb  Why  my Dear  he threw all the Work back upon me  as I told you  but I believe the Issue was that both he  and I also  talked to  Thomas  about his Discontent and his Melancholly and about his going out of Doors  Wife  Very well  and what Account did he give of himself  Husb  Why that of his Melancholly came in of Course but as to his going abroad before Day  and the like  and especially on the Sabbathday in the Evening he told me he went over the Way to Neighbour  M's  the Clothiers  Wife  What could he be doing there It must be with some of their Servants then for they are very sober good People he could get no Ill among them but they have a Boy a young Fellow their Prentice that is the wickedest young Rogue that ever was heard of it must be some ugly Haunt he has got with him  I doubt  that carries him thither  and if it is that  the Boy is undone  Husb  That was the very Thing I was afraid of too but we are both strangely mistaken  Thomas  is quite another Lad than any of us took him for and instead of learning Wickedness from that vicious Boy he has been  God  's Instrument to make that Boy the greatest Convert that ever you heard of  Wife  I am surprized it can never be Are you sure you are not imposed upon  Husb  No no I am not imposed upon he has more Grace and more Goodness in him than ever I heard of in a Child of his Age for he is but a Child he has been the greatest Reproof to me  in the Neglect of my Family Government that ever I met with  Wife  Tell me these Matters more plainly for I am more curious to know them than any Thing I ever heard of  Husb  I will  my Dear  I'll tell thee all the particulars  Here the Husband relates exactly the last Conference he had with his Prentice  Dial    Wife  How pretty and modest was that Answer That you was not pleased to admit him to your Family when you went to the Worship of  God  Husb  Ah  my Dear  But how bitter a Reproach was it  think you  to me when my own Heart struck me with such Thoughts as these  Wretch that I am  how innocently this Child thinks  as indeed it is rational to imagine  that it should be impossible but that  God  must be worshipped in every Christian Family only suggesting that I had shut him out or did not think him worthy to join with us whereas the plain but dreadful Truth is I have lived like a Heathen all my Life and never have worshipped  God  in my Family at all  Wife  He saw no great Appearance of it I confess I wonder how he had such a Thought  Husb  Yes  my Dear  there was some Appearance of it but not on my Side  As I said before  that I had the Reputation of what  you had performed  so  no doubt  he had seen or some of the Children or Servants had spoken of your calling the Children into your Closet with you and he supposed we might be all together at Prayer I wish it had been really so  Wife  But  my Dear  what Satisfaction have you of the Truth of all this  Husb  I am not easily imposed upon  my Dear  I took little Notice of the Thing from him nor gave him any Reason to think I believed him but told him I should talk further with him about it Indeed to tell you the Truth I could not hold to talk any more to him at that Time  Wife  And how will you be satisfied Cannot you enquire of Mr  M  the Clothier or of his Wife They are both good conscientious People and what they say may be depended upon I wish you had asked them  Husb  Indeed  my Dear  I have been there this Afternoon 'tis there I have received the full Conviction of my own Neglect of Duty of the wicked Lad's Conversion and of our own Boy's Character The Particulars will amaze you if you were to hear them  Wife  My Dear  I beg you let me hear it all for the Story too nearly concerns me not to have me very much moved with it and besides it is very affecting in it self  Husb  You shall  my Dear  Here the Husband relates the whole Discourse between him and the Clothier and his Wife as in the third Dialogue and the Account of her Discourse with the once wicked but now converted Boy  Wife  This is a surprizing Story What can there be in the Boy to do all this Have you talked with him your self  Husb  I have talked a little with him indeed I was so touch'd with the Reproof which his Discourse  innocently in him for he perceived nothing  was to me when he said  It grieved him that I did not think him worthy to be reckoned among my Family or admitted to the Worship of God with me and  my Children  that as I told you before I could not hear to stay and talk with him any longer lest he should perceive it  Wife  It was very cutting indeed all the Parts of it considered  Husb  The Tears stood in my Eyes in Spight of all my Endeavours to the contrary Indeed how could I forbear when I knew how I had lived and that I had never troubled my self about any such Thing as the Worship of God with my Family tho' I know well enough how much it had been my Duty to ha' done it  Wife  I cannot say but I am glad it has happened so tho' I think its coming from the Boy was so odd Are you sure the Boy did not do it by way of Jeer  Husb  Not in the least the Modesty and Innocence of the Boy and his Backwardness to say any Thing at all leave no Room for such a Thought  Wife  I wish you would talk with him again perhaps you may hear more from him that may explain it all to you  Husb  I intend it  my Dear  I'll go down and talk with him just now  The Master goes down and going into a Closet which he had near the ComptingHouse hears the young Man engaged with one or two of the Journeymen and the rest of the Prentices about the Subject in Hand upon which he places himself undiscovered and hears the following Discourse  Journeyman  Well  Young Man  What you have been examined about your Morning Walks I understand I wonder your Master found you out no sooner  Thomas  Perhaps if you had told him of it sooner he would have known it sooner  Jour  You are mistaken in the Informer tho' whoever it was he was much your Friend  Tho  Where did the Friendship of it lye  Jour  Where  Why in preventing your ruining your self when young Boys  like you  get such Haunts and go out of their Masters Houses at such Hours privately it is very seldom for any Good and quickly ruins them  Tho  That Word  very seldom  implies that you believe it may be sometimes on a good Account  Jour  Ay ay  sometimes  but very seldom  I say  what Good could you be doing at that time of Day I wonder  Tho  That is bringing me to a second Examination I have given an Account of that to my Master and to my Father already and they are satisfied why should you take me to Task  Jour  Nay  that's true  I have nothing to do with it I care not what Hours you keep or what Company you keep or how you ruin your self what is it to me  Tho  Well  I am the less obliged to you for that  Jour  Why  so you are  but when you say your Master is satisfied I must beg your Pardon  for that Tho  I do not believe a Word of that  I assure you  Eldest Pren  Nay  now you wrong him indeed for  I assure you  my Master told me that he was satisfied about it and that I should not hinder him as I had resolv'd to do by taking out the Key of the Warehouse door and carrying it up to my Master every Night  Jour  Nay  if my Master be satisfied I ha'done either there must be some Mystery in it then or he has told him some fine Story that has deceiv'd him the young Rogue has a soft Tongue  Eld Pr  I could say more of it  if I thought  Thomas  would not think I spoke to expose him  Tho  Your withholding it in such a Manner is more my Disadvantage another Way for now it looks as if it were some very bad Thing tho' I have not been forward to tell it yet I am not so shy of it as to be willing to have it thought a Crime  Jour  I am very glad if it be no Crime  Thomas  I never wish'd you any ill  Pren  Truly it is so far from a Crime that if I had known before how it was  I would ha' gone with him  if they would have let me for to be free with you upon full Examination it appears that he went over to Mr  's  the Clothier Night and Morning to Prayers and my Master has examined it to the utmost and is satisfied that it has been nothing else  Jour  To Prayers nay if that is all that's very well indeed  and of that presently  but you make me smile to hear you say you would ha' gone along with him  d Prentice  Ay that would make any Body laugh  I dare say  he never said his Prayers in his Life  st Prentice  It's no Matter for that  Jonathan  nor is that any Thing to you if I han't there's the more Need to begin now I doubt you have no Need to reprove me  d Prentice  Why so  st Pr  Why ha'n't I heard you ridicule all such Things and banter the honest Man over the Way for going to Prayers in the cold Mornings before it was Day And didn't you use to jeer poor  Thomas  here when he came first because when he went to Bed at Night he would kneel down by his Bed Side to say his Prayers  d Pr  Why now you do  as you did before  charge me with your own Crime did not you do so as well as I and Mr  M  that's the Journeyman too  Thomas  I committed a greater Crime than any of you  in that Part  I wish I had not  st Prentice  What's that  Thomas  Thomas  In letting your wicked scoffing at me prevail with me more wickedly to neglect my Duty if I had continued to pray to God as I ought to have done he would soon have made you ashamed of mocking me or ha' made me not regard it  The Lad Weeps  st Pr  Indeed  Thomas  I was ashamed of it when I did it and I am more sorry for it now since you tell me it master'd your Resolution and made you leave it off I have thought on it a hundred Times  since that  with Regret that tho' I did not pray to God my self I should discourage another For whether I performed it or no  my self  I never thought the worse of another that did for I knew it was what every one ought to do  Tho  That makes your Fault the worse to neglect it when you knew you ought to have done it and this is just my Fault I am in the same Case  st Pr  No  Thomas  There's this Difference between you and I you have repented and amended it and I have not  Tho  I think it almost broke my Heart and yet I know not whether to call it Repentance or no for what's all my Trouble at it in Proportion to the Crime There may be much Sorrow where there's little Repentance  Jour  Why  Thomas  has that been the Cause you have been so melancholly of late  Tho  Is not that Cause enough However I do not say that has been all the Cause  Jour  Well  he has been ill used by us all  I must own that  and he does not deserve such Usage from us I think we have acted by him like perfect infidels never was Poor Young Man so treated  for serving God  sure What Kind of Creatures have we been  Prentice  I confess I am amazed at it I did not use to do so I know not what possess'd me at that Time  Jour  And was this the Reason of your going over to Mr  's Thomas  st Pr  No no  it was because they kept a regular Family there and go constantly to Prayers Night and Morning Mr is a very good Man every Body knows that and I observe every Body nay the wickedest People in the Parish love that Man I never heard any Body speak a disrespectful Word of him but our  Jonathan  there that laughed at him for rising before Day in the cold Weather to go to Prayers  d Pr  Yes  you have heard his own Prentice  Will  do the same Thing  Jour  That's a wicked young Rogue indeed you have named a pretty Youth for our Example  d Pr  You see all his Prayers and his being so good a Man does him no good he can't make him a good Boy  Tho  You know nothing of that Boy and very little of what you talk of I wish I was as good a Boy as that  Will  is now  st Pr  It's very true that Boy is the Wonder of this Town he is the greatest Penitent and is turned the soberest most Religious Young Man that ever was heard of  Jour  I am amazed at it why then you see  Jonathan  what the having a good Master has done  st Pr  Nay that has not been it neither and  to do Justice  though  Thomas  says modestly that he wishes himself as good as  William  I have a very good Account that  Thomas  was the first means of reclaiming him  Tho  God's Grace has been the Means and a religious good Instructor at home I am uncapable to do any Thing of that Kind his Master and Mistress have been the Instruments he is very happy in coming into such a Family  Jour  But was this really the Reason of  Thomas'  going over thither so every Night and Morning  st Pr  Yes it was my Master says he has examined it why are you so unbelieving  Jour  Nay  for no ill  I could not have expected it but I shall love him the better for it as long as I know him I wonder what my Master thinks of it or says to it  st Pr  Says I told you didn't I He is very well satisfied in it and ordered me that I should not hinder him  Jour  God forbid any should hinder him  for my Part  if I was Ten Times wickeder than I am would never wish to make another be so  d Pr  You are all growing mighty good of a sudden this Fit of Religion will be over with you by and by when you come to  An Alehouse in the Town which it seems they Haunted too much  Kate  's down the Street  st Pr  Your Eyes shall never see that of me again nor see me at that wicked House again  Tho  Do not undertake for that in your own Strength lest you are left to know your self by your Fall  st Pr  I hope God will give me Grace to keep that Resolution  Tho  You must seek it then  ask and thou shalt  eceive  st Pr  I wish I had been in such a House as that Clothiers I was never brought up to live as we do here  d Pr  Why can't our Master go to Prayers with us as well as that poor Man does  Jour  What for you to laugh at him as you did at the poor Clothier and at  Thomas  too  d Pr  You have all done it as much as I  Tho  I don't doubt we all fare the worse for  t as well those who are not guilty as those who  re  d Pr  How do you mean  Tho  Mean Why it is plain enough my Ma  ter and Mistress go to Prayers every Night and Morning with themselves and the little Children  nd if he did not take us for a scoffing irreligious  eprobate Pack that would be never the better  or it and would but make a Jest of it and of  im too  to be sure  he would call us all up but  e sees how we live and does not count us wor  hy to be admitted  st Pr  Are you sure of that  Thomas  Tho  Sure of it  Why is there any sober Man  n the World that calls himself a Christian and  oes not do it  Jour  Poor  Thomas  thou knowest but little of  he World is there one Family in Ten that  oes Nay is there one Family in this Town  hat does except the good Man over the Way  ere the Clothier  Tho  Yes  my Father does I never knew him  mit it in my Life if he was well and our Mi  ster does and some that I know in the Town  ay I know none that do not  Jour  I am sure  I know Twenty Families in the Town that do not and yet call themselves good Christians too and I never believed our Master did  Tho  I'll never believe such a Thing of my Master besides ha'n't I heard the little Children say to one another they must go up to Prayers  Jour  Nay then  to be sure  he does I am very glad of it I wish he would call us all up  Tho  No Question if my Master knew you wish'd so he would but we don't live as if we desired it I believe that is the Reason we are left to live like Heathens as we are  st Pr  I am sorry we have given him so much Cause to think so and indeed  Thomas  it is but too true  Jour  Well  for all that he might have gone to Prayers  Tho  So he does  I tell you  but does not think us fit People to join with him  Jour  Why  the worse we are have we not the more Need of being pray'd for  Tho  But  I cannot but say  he might have good Reason to shut us out that our bad Example might not be shewn to his Children  Jour  Why  thou makest us worse than Heathens Boy What do'st mean Do you believe that if my Master should come now and say to us all that tho' he finds we do not regard such Things yet that he resolves to go to Prayers every Night and Morning and we may come if we will that we would not all say we would come with all our Hearts I'm sure I would for one  st Pr  I am sure I'd down on my Knees and thank him for it for I am more concerned at seeing how we live  now  than ever I was  Tho  I am sure I'd thank him and thank God for it too and think it the best Day that I ever saw in my Life  d Pr  I have heard all your Discourse and have said but little but I'll tell you I'll never jest with any Body for praying to God again while I live I wish my Master would begin with us and try  Any one may judge how the Master who heard all this Discourse was moved with it being before affected with the Sense of having lived in a Total Neglect of his Duty to God and his Family and having thus providentially the great Obstruction to his Duty removed by hearing all his Men Servants who he thought refractory and ungovernable declare themselves toucht with a Sense of their Loss in being shut out from the Worship of God professing their Willingness to join in a Religious Regulation and their Desire of having their Master begin it  Wherefore coming hastily out of his Closet into the Place and the Young Men rising up to be gone he bids them all stay and sit still  '  I have heard all your Discourse  says the Master  and I bless God that I have heard it I am very well pleased with every Part of it  I do own to you all  that it has been a Hindrance to my Desire of setting up the Worship of God in my Family that I thought my young Men having had their full Liberty in the World made no Account of such Things and might perhaps mock at me for it as I have heard you have done at the poor Clothier over the Way and tho' it was my Duty to have done it  however you had behaved  yet I confess it has been such a S  e to me as  kept me back from what I know to be my Duty But since I have providentially heard your Discourse upon  this Subject and that you seem to be sensible of your Duty and of your Loss in the Omission of mine and appear willing to join in a solemn Manner in Family Prayer I will not be wanting to you nor wanting to my self in performing my Duty any longer but according to my Duty and your Desire call you all up together with the rest of my Family to worship God and pray to him for his Blessing I hope you will convince me you are in earnest by your Attendance at that Time  The Journeyman told him yes  for his Part  he would with all his Heart  The First Prentice told him that since he had heard him make a Promise to thank him upon his Knees he would perform it  and kneeling down  he thanked God that had put it in his Heart and thank'd his Master as he had promised and assured him the very Thoughts of it rejoiced his Heart  Poor  Thomas  the Youngest Prentice his Heart was so full he cried for Joy and could not speak a Word  The other Prentice told his Master he was very sorry he had been one of them that had hindred him before but assured him it should be so no more  The Good Man went up with Joy to his Wife and giving her an Account how his  Second Difficulty was thus providentially removed told her the whole Passage The Pious Lady reioicing at the Thing and willing to prompt him on to put his Resolution in Practice before it might cool and fall off again perswaded him the same Evening to call his Family together and beginning with reading the Scriptures to go to Prayer with them  which he did  and from that Time forward he had always Sober Religious Servants and kept a most Regular Family exactly and constantly performing Family Worship instructing and catechising both his Children and Servants to the great Encouragement and Increase of true Godliness and Holy Living in that Town by his extraordinary Example  The End of the Fifth Dialogue and of the Second Part  PART III  The First DIALOGUE  AT the End of the first Part of this Work the Father of the Family having effectually set about reforming his House and brought all his Children  except his Two Eldest  to conform to his new Regulation this Part gives something of an Historical Account of the Two Refractory Rebellious Branches of that Family  viz  The Eldest Son and the Eldest Daughter  the Son  pursuing the Dictates  not of his Reason  but of his Passion and having some Estate independent of his Father gratifies his Disgust at his Father's imposing upon him  as he calls it  and goes abroad to Travel His Conduct  as a Pattern or Warning to Disobedience  is followed by continual Judgments Disasters and Distempers till his Estate wasted and gone he is brought to humble himself to his Father and submit to him however unwillingly and unreformed not as a true Penitent but for meer Subsistance and for want of Bread  This is improved to be instructive of many Things both to Children and Parents  It shews something of the mischievous Consequence of leaving Estates to Children intirely independant of their Parents especially where no visible Objection lies against the Trust being reposed in the Parent  And tells us  That tho' in some Cases it may be necessary to do thus yet it ought to be avoided as much as possible it being in general a fatal Obstruction to Paternal Authority a Foundation of Childrens refusing Instruction and especially of their not bearing Reproof besides that oftentimes the Consequences are such That the Children had better be without such Estates  This Example warns Children that th  they may  by Provision of Friends  be made independant of their Parents they are not thereby discharged of their Duty to their Parents in the least and great Judgments from Heaven generally follow those who totally cast off the Subjection they owe to their Parents on that Account    First  or  Last  a Contempt of Paternal Instruction is nothing else but laying in a great Stock for Repentance  The Daughter who of the two appeared the most Obstrnate and could not bear the Restraint which her Father's new Discipline obliged her to got leave of her Father and Mother to go and live with her Aunt  her Father's Sister  who lived at some Distance from them in  London  where tho' the Family was strictly Religious  as is before noted  yet being there but as a Guest she could better  comply with it than at Home where she had been used to Liberties and left to her self and where the Change being by Constraint was the harder for her to stoop to  Her Aunt  a sober Religious Gentlewoman and her Uncle a grave pious good Christian treated her with great Kindness and Courtesy and  as she had been very well bred  good Manners obliged her to return it Here an unforeseen Providence gave a Turn to the whole Course of her Life the Young Lady being of a good natural Temper a modest handsome Carriage and an agreeable Person her Uncle's Eldest Son  by a former Wife  fell in Love with her and by Consent of his Father a Proposal of Marriage was made between them and this Part is made publick in this manner because the Circumstances of this Marriage have some Thing in them very instructing to young married People to let them see how much it is their unquestioned and indispensable Duty to make the good of one anothers Souls be their Principal Care after Marriage how far it may be the Duty of a Husband to instruct his Wife and in what Manner and likewise a Wife her Husband how far such a Design may be consistent with the tenderest Affection and how to be manag'd with Decency Respect and the due Endearments of a loving and tender Relation and in short gives a brief Scheme of the Relative Duties of a married State  This compleats the Oeconomy of this Work  the First Part  relating to a Paternal Duty such as Authority and Discipline in a Father among his Children  The Second  to the Duty of Heads of Families  viz  Masters of Servants and how Servants ought to submit to Instruction and Family Regulation  and this Third Part  principally regarding the Duty of Husbands and Wives to  exhort and perswade intreat instruct and  by all gentle means  if possible prevail upon and engage one another to a Religious Holy Life and to set up a Foundation of Religious Worship in their Families  The Introduction or History of this Marriage is not material to our present Discourse only some Thing of the Characters of the Persons and Families  more than what has been said already  may be proper to prevent Digressions in the particular Cases that come after and these Characters or Descriptions will be found in the first Dialogue and upon the following Occasion  The Young Gentleman was the Eldest Son of the Family and Heir to his Father who had a good Estate he had been bred a Gentleman had a liberal Education was a handsome agreeable Person and which was beyond all was  like his Father  a sober virtuous studious and religious Gentleman This Person having been conversant with this young Lady by the Accident of their being in the House and as will appear she being very agreeable to him  however engaged by the Defect of Education in Gayety and Mirth and hard to be weaned especially by Violence as had been her Case  her Disposition I say being soft and of an extraordinary Sweetness in her Temper as will be seen in the Process of these Sheets there appear'd a particular Suitableness in them one to another  The Young Gentleman had entertained an Opinion of her being capable to make him a very good Wife tho' he was not ignorant of her being wild and gay in her Humour yet he had great Proofs by daily Conversation with her of her being virtuous and modest even to the utmost Nicety the Goodness of her Temper and agreeableness of her Person had engaged his Affections  to her and he had no Reason to believe that she had any Aversion to him whereupon he broke his Design to his Father who knowing his Son's Sobriety and serious Inclination was the less inclin'd to thwart his Affections and the less afraid to venture him in the Matter of the young Lady's Humour tho' it was thought to be a little extravagant and gay  as above  so the Father after some Consideration calling him aside one Morning spoke to him to this Purpose  SON I have considered what you said to me about your Desire to court your Cousin I am very willing to gratifie your Inclinations in any Thing that may have a Prospect of making you easy and happy and shall be as kind to you with Respect to Estate as you can expect but  you know  she is gay and wild loves Company and Mirth and that it was her Impatience of Restraint in these Things that made the Breach between her and her Father and if she should continue that Humour after you have married her I doubt you will have but an uncomfortable Life with her  However  I do not think her of an ill Disposition as to her natural Temper and perhaps she may be prevailed with by good Ʋsage and kind Treatment  which I hope is all the Method you propose to take with her  to alter her Notions of Things  I  think she seems to be a little come off from some Part of it since she came into our Family I would have you seriously consider what Hazard you run in it  and especially that the Venture is for your Life  and as I have no other Objection against it I shall agree or not agree to it as your Inclination shall lead you only not forgetting to hint to you  what I hope you do not forget  viz That you ask Council and Direction  of him who has said  Commit thy Way unto the LORD and he shall direct thy Steps  This Discourse was too affectionate and obliging not to move a Son of so much Sense and Goodness as he was which he exprest  as became him  in a dutiful and obliging Manner and having after further Consideration continued his Inclinations and  not so only but  made some Advances of that Kind  to the young Lady her self  it became necessary in the next Place to have it moved to her  Father  and  Mother  and as they were the Relations of the old Lady  MotherinLaw to the young Gentlewoman  this occasioned her  at her Husbands Desire  to go to her Sister  the young Lady Mother  and break the Matter to her where after a little other Discourse  needless to our Purpose  the Mother began with her and so introduce the following Dialogue between the two Sisters Mother and Aunt to the young Gentlewoman  Mo  Dear Sister  I believe you do not doubt your being always welcome to me and yet I can not say that I am so glad to see you come hither  as I used to be  Aunt  Why what's the Matter Sister  if my coming gives you any Uneasiness I'll be gone again  Mo  My Heart misgives me and I  always  expect something of Evil when you come  Aunt  Evil  about what  I beseech you  Mo  Why about this  Ʋnhappy Girl  at your House I ever think you have some dreadful Story or other to tell me of her  Aunt  What can your  worst Thoughts  lead you to fear of her  Mo  Dear Sister  what  can I not  fear for her When I see her treat her Father in such a manner who has loved her so affectionately and used her  so gently in all this Matter and now she has  in a Manner  gone away from him purely on an Account which all the rest of the Family are thankful for and what any Child of Sense or Virtue would have loved and valued him for  As for her Ʋsage of me  I take no Notice of it at all  I forgive her all that  Aunt  Well but you must wait a little her Temper may be wrought upon by Degrees to be sensible of her Mistake I hope  Sister  you don't look on her as lost  they go far indeed that never return  Mo  But have you no bad News  now  about her Did not you come  now on purpose  to make some Complaint of her to me Pray put me out of my Pain  Aunt  I wish you would tell me  what you are afraid of  about her  Mo  Nay  there's nothing so bad that I am not afraid of what can I expect when GOD has so far forsaken her as to suffer her to fly in her Father's Face and that purely because he would have her live a sober religious Life Pray how does she behave her self  Aunt  Sister I will be very plain with you  I am very far you may be sure from approving her Behaviour to her Father  or to you  but really she discovers nothing in her Behaviour among us that gives the least Ground to be afraid of her  on any other Account  Mo  Has she no Company that comes to her or that she goes abroad to  Aunt  None at all  she has not gone out of our Doors since she came thither nor has any Body come to her that I know of but your own Family such as your own Servants or Children  Mo  Well thon  Good Manners obliges her to do more with you than Duty would do here for when I told her that she should go no more to the plays nor visit or go to the Park a Sabbath Days  she told me to my Face  she would not be confined  Aunt  I see nothing but she is very conformable with us  Mo  I pray God she may come to a Sight of her own Folly when ever she humbles her self to GOD I am very sure he will bring her to humble her self to her Father for she treated him very rudely and unbecoming  what to do with her I know not  she can never expect to come into her Father's Doors again  but as a Penitent  and that with very good Satisfaction of her being sincerely so  Aunt  I know the Substance of the Breach but I never knew the last Part I was going once or twice to talk of it to her but I found it disordered her and set her into a Fit of crying and I am unwilling to discompose her  Mo  Why Sister you know the Story it self and upon what the Difference began  viz  about restraining her and her Brother from going to the Park a Sabbath Days going to the Play and reading Plays  and the like  and you have heard how the first Sabbath Day after this Thing was debated among us  when her Father began that happy Reformation in his Family which blessed be GOD is strictly kept up to this Day  she and her Brother contrived to go out of the Way  we thought indeed  they had gone to the Park in Defiance of their Father  and my Heart aked I confess for them  for their Father was so provoked at the thought of it that he had resolved they should neither of them have ever come into his House again till they had humbled themselves and acknowledged  both their Sins against GOD  and their Contempt of their Father and he had ordered all the Servants to keep them out if they came to the Gate till they called him to them but  happily for us all  they were it seems only walking  in the Limetree Walk  behind our Garden and just as we were enquiring about it they appeared walking  together  thro' the Garden entirely ignorant of what had passed However their Father not fully satisfied before they came in went to them himself into the Garden and strictly examined them about it As they had the good Hap to satisfie their Father that they had been no further than  the Limetrees  so they satisfied themselves by seeing their Father in the greatest Rage they had ever known him in  I say they satisfied themselves  of what they had to expect  if it had been otherwise  and this put them upon reflecting what Course they had to take where  Dear Sister  who can but observe That in all their Consultations GOD did not give them the Grace once to think of submitting themselves to their Father and conforming themselves to the most reasonable Desire that ever Father made to his Children  viz only to restrain wicked Liberties and Company and attend the Worship of GOD in the Family  but on the contrary for Five Weeks that they stay'd at Home  after that  they never appeared at Prayer Time but kept up Stairs pretending either not to be well or not dressed or not up and such like Excuses till they were a Shame to the whole Family And besides this their Father observed That notwithstanding his express Command they went both of them twice to the Play House the very same Week as if on Purpose to insult him and let him see they valued not what he either said or would say to them  Aunt  That was very provoking indeed  pray what said my Brother to it  Mo  If it had not been for me  Sister  he had turned them both out of Door that very Week  Aunt  Indeed I could not ha' blamed him if he had  I think  he had done them but Justice  Mo  I am sure he had done himself Justice  Sister  but I considered their Good more than they did themselves and that to have cast them entire  y off had been to precipitate their Ruin and throw them into the very Mouth of all Manner of Temptation and representing this to their Father it convinced him  so far  as not to proceed to that Extremity with them but he had told them in so many Words by me That since they had declined his Authority he would decline their Conversation that those that would not join with him in his Duty to GOD should not enjoy with him the Bounty of GOD and they that would not kneel with him to pray should not sit with him to eat and so he flatly forbad them his Sight  Aunt  I think he was very just in it I wonder how it was possible they could behave so  Mo  You may be sure it could not hold long thus and at best it made a very melancholy Family among us at last  my Son truly  came to his Father and in few Words told him he was sorry he had disobliged him so much but as he saw no Remedy  he told his Father  he came to ask his Consent to a Resolution he had taken to Travel  His Father  said readily there was no need for his Consent if it was a Resolution he supposed he Father came to take his Leave of him the foolish Boy  for tho' he is a Man in Growth he shewed the Boy and the Fool in his Behaviour  told his Father he was resolved to go but had rather have his Consent than not  Aunt  He acted weakly in that and rudely too pray how did  my Brother  take it  Mo  Truly with more Composure than I could have expected he told him that  as his Father  he could not but be sorry to see him push on his own Ruin but as it was his Duty to exercise the Authority of a Father he not only refused to consent but forbid him to go And withal bid him remember what he had said to him before  viz  That if he set his Foot out of his House upon this Account he should never set his Foot in it again but  as a Penitent  Aunt  What could he say to that  Mo  Truly he said little but told his Father he was resolved to go and so withdrew And the same Evening without acquainting me with it or taking any further Leave he went his Way  Aunt  Went his Way  Sister  why whither did he go I am sure he is not gone abroad now for he has been several times at our House to see his Sister within this Week  Mo  No  he is not gone  yet  we know that he has Lodgings at  Westminster  and Yesterday he wrote his Father a Letter pretending to beg his Pardon for going abroad without his Consent you know  Sister  he has about  l  a Year which his Uncle left him so he thinks himself his own Master  Aunt  Alas how long will that last for a foolish gay Fellow that expects to make a Figure and look like a Gentleman abroad  Mo  Not long to be sure I expect he will see his way through it very quickly  Aunt  Why I hear he has bought a Commission I suppose he has disposed of some of it already that Way  Mo  It's very likely but he acquaints me with nothing I expect we shall hear of him again when it is all spent  Aunt  It may be so indeed  Mo  Well If he may but come Home like the Prodigal I shall not think that Estate ill lost I shall be glad of his Poverty for the Sake of his Penitence  Aunt  Well and what said  my Niece  to all this  Mo  Truly she kept her Chamber  as I told you  above a Month and hardly ever was seen in the Family I cannot imagine what Folly possest them both she cried incessantly converst with no Body would scarce speak if I came to her at last she fell very Sick  as well she might  Sure as I told her one Day  no Girl was ever such a Mourner for the Loss of her wicked Pleasures  Aunt  Childhood and Youth are Vanity  Mo  I took what Care I could of her and especially to remove the Discontents of her Mind for we all believed she would die I asked her if she would see her Father nay her Father who I think verily wept for her more than I did would  I believe  ha' been tempted to have broke his Resolutions and ha' been reconciled to her and would fain ha' been so far reconciled as to see her but when I did but Name him she burst out into a fit of crying and would not so much as hear of it but  her Brother her Brother  if  her Brother  might come again she would see him Well such was the Tenderness of her Father to her  who most passionately loved her  That he would ha' given Way to have her Brother come again  but when he came to be told of it  he insolently answered he would not come unless his Father would send for him This you may be sure was provoking  nay Sister  it moved me so  at them both  that tho' he is my  own Son and my eldest I care not if I never see him more except in the Terms as above  and as for her  I committed her to GOD'S Mercy and concerned my self no more about her other than to take Care she wanted nothing  Aunt  I never heard the like in my Life  pray what said my Brother  Mo  Truly he was not so provoked at it as I thought he would ha' been I mean it did not throw him into a Passion he retired into his Closet and in an Hour or two came down again composed in his Temper but I could see  like that of Job  his Grief was great and indeed from that Time I thought it my Duty rather to comfort my Husband than my Daughter While she continued ill he was very uneasy and impatient but when she recovered again he was better satisfied and thought less of her Our next Consideration was what was to be done with her for our Family look'd very odly we had Authority quite turned up Side down among us instead of her Father refusing to be reconciled to her  who had been the guilty Person and had provoked him to the utmost  truly she pretends Resentment and refuses to be reconciled to her Father  Aunt  It was strange Usage  I confess  I did not think she had been of such a Spirit  Mo  When she was recovered and was well enough to go abroad instead of going to Church to give GOD Thanks for restoring her Health she wanted to go to a young wild Companion of hers  my Lady Lighthead  that they might go to the Play together I could not bear the Thoughts of this with any Patience but being not willing to disturb her Father with it because I knew it would exasperate him I took upon me to tell her of my own Authority  that she should not go  at which she  said very smartly to me  she had but one Request more to make me as long as she lived  and what's that said I  That you'll let me go to Service  says she very scornfully  Dear Sister  you may judge how cutting this Usage has been to us who so dearly loved this Child as that we distinguished her in our Affections from the rest of our Children and that even to a Fault  Aunt  That Kind of Love is generally so returned  Sister  and Providence suffers it to be so as a just Punishment for an ill grounded and unequal dividing our Affections among our Children  in which Case  we may read our Sin in our Punishment but I pray what said you to her I know not I confess what  I should  ha' done or said to it I believe  I should  ha' been apt to ha' told her That  her Petition was granted  Mo  If I had consulted my own Passions rather than her Welfare I should ha' done so too for I was not without Resentment enough but I saw  Sister  she was rash and foolish and I was not so willing to let her ruin her self as she was to do it  Aunt  But Pray  what did you say to her  Mo  I told her  It was Pity a Petition that had so much Ingratitude in it should not find Resentment enough in me  to grant it that  however I would give her a Week to cool her Thoughts in and in that Time I would have her consider seriously of what she had desired and if she would say then  calmly  and  deliberately  That she desired it still I would acquaint her Father with it  and it should be granted  only I bad her remember the Condition which her Father had made with her Brother  viz  That if ever he set his Foot out of the House in this Quarrel he should never have Leave to set his Foot in it again  but as a Penitent  and she might depend upon it  That  both her Father  and I too  would make the same Condition with her at Parting  And so I left her to conside  of it  Aunt  I suppose she was wiser when she had thought of it  Mo  Yes about or Days after she asked me if I would give her Leave to go to her Aunt  meaning your House I told her  yes  I would con+sent to that  if her Father would agree to it  so a  her Request I asked her Father to let her come to your House and he was willing enough in hope your Family would enure and acquaint her wit  good Things but he would not consent till sh  had promised solemnly that she would keep  Company nor go to any Plays or bring printe  Plays home to your House and she promised  sh  would not  So we sent her to you but I dare sa  she will not keep her Word  Aunt  Well  she is very welcome to my House and I assure you  as I said before  she carries he  self very modestly and handsomely among us  Mo  Nay  she is of a very good Temper and a  obliging Carriage enough she wants neither Wi  or Manners She wants nothing  Sister  but GOD  Grace  Aunt  All our Children love her Company e  +treamly and  some of them  more than I have tol  you of yet  Mo  And do you think she has kept her Promi  with us about Plays and my Lady  Aunt  I dare say she has  as I said before  f  we see no Body come near her but her Broth  sometimes and she tells us in Compliment Sh  is exceedingly diverted with the Company of  Daughters So that she has quite left off a  Conversation  Mo  And does She conform to your Family Orders Sister and appear at Family Worship constantly  Aunt  Indeed  Sister  she must do it in our House or we would not keep her there  nay  none of our Children would keep her Company or endure her  if she did not  for I thank GOD we have no Contemners of Religion among us But I must do  my Niece  that Justice that I never perceived the least Reluctancy in her to any thing that was good in my Life  I mean at our House  nay  Sister  we have a mighty Opinion of her being very sober and you will say so too when I tell you really what I came hither about at this Time  Mo  What is that  Sister  Aunt  Why I am come to ask her of you and my Brother for my Son  Mo  Dear Sister  We are but in a sorry Circumstance  as to her  to be jested with your Son is a pretty Youth and GOD may give her more Grace  by that Time He is fit for a Wife  If she is fit to deserve him you might be sure we should not be against it but their Age would be unequal and they are very near a Kin  Sister  besides those Things are remote I have no Heart to talk of marrying her I dare not wish any Family  that I have a value for  to venture upon her  Aunt  You quite mistake me  Sister  it is not my own Son  that I mean  but  my SoninLaw  my Husband's Son I assure you  I am not in Jest  Mo  I am surprized to hear you Talk so  Sister  Aunt  Well do not be surprized I must Talk with you about it  in earnest  Moth  Dear Sister  Do not entertain such a Thought I am sure I can never agree to it for  your Sake you will but injure your own Peace and my Brother  your Husband  will think you and we are Confederate to draw him in besides you know he has a good Estate settled upon him and as for this Girl she has so disobliged her Father I cannot in Conscience desire him  to do any thing for her  especially while she is in this State of Obstinacy and Rebellion How can it be expected Therefore if you love your own  Family Peace I  would advise you seriously  do not think of such a Thing  besides  Sister  your SoninLaw is a sober virtuous religious Gentleman  you see  what a mad desperate furious Spirit  this Girl is of  a profest Enemy to all that is Good  one that  is broke from her Father meerly because he would reform her you cannot in Conscience propose such a Match to a Gentleman that deserves so well I would not have a Hand in making him so miserable for the World  Aunt  Sister Sister  You speak very honestly and like your self but you quite mistake the Case you take this for a Project of my own to advance your Daughter and oblige you and my own Family but you are quite wrong the young Gentleman has made the Motion to his Father and his Father to me so that  I only come of the Errand  'tis all Matter of their own Choice the Young Man first and the Father Consenting at his Request  Mo  I am amazed at it do they know the Breach that has been among us  Aunt  Yes  every Word of it  Mo  Dear Sister  do not deceive me I will never give my Consent so much as to speak a Word farther about it  unless they are told the worst of it all  for I will be no Cheat they shall never say  hey were deceived by me tho' it be for my own Daughter  Aunt  Indeed Sister  I have not deceived them  or I talk'd with my SoninLaw two Hours and  old him every Word I knew of it all  neither  ould it be hid  for every one in our Family  nows it She does not deny it her self  Aunt  As I told you  She always breaks out into  ears and we don't care to grieve her so we  orbear it as much as possible but she knows that we all know of it besides you will be satisfied by  Reason you shall hear presently That she has  ome Sense of her Circumstances for that when we have talk'd to her of Marrying and named  uch a one or  such  another she would say to us  why do we talk to her of marrying  That has  no For  une  and that  her Father will give her nothing  that  e never expects he will be reconciled  to her again  r do any Thing for her  and the like  and then  t always ends in Tears and that makes us break  ff the Story  Mo  Upon what Foundation then  Sister  can  his Proposal be made to her Father it is certain That tho' no Family could be more agreeable to  s than yours yet it cannot be expected he should  ear any Thing of it until she comes and humbles  er self and acknowledges her Fault indeed no Body can propose it to him before upon any reason  able Foundation She cannot expect her Father  hould seek her again who did it so unexpectedly  efore and was rejected with such abominable  nsolence when she did not know too but the was  pon the Brink of the Grave  Aunt  I canfess  That was a hard Case and I know not what to say to it  Mo  Besides Sister  I cannot think the Young Gentleman would be so mad to think any more of  her if he knew what I have told you about her to Day and I am resolved  if he will have her  nothing shall be hid from him that Justice requires should be told  Aunt  Indeed Sister  I have been as faithful to him as you can be except only what you told me just now he does not at all justify her Conduct  but says  he believes she has other Principles now and if my Brother will give his Consent to let him have her  he says  he will come and ask Pardon for her  Mo  My Husband is above in his Closet if you please  I'll call him  and hear what he says  Aunt  With all my Heart  She sends a Servant to call her Husband and he comes immediately  Mo  My Dear  here's an odd Piece of News to be told you  Husb  No good I doubted assoon as I saw who was the Messenger  well Sister  let us know it however  let it be as bad as it will Pray  what mad thing has my Daughter done at your House  Mo  When  we fear Evil  we always believe it your fears push you too fast  my Dear  Husb  In the ordinary Course of GOD's Providence I can expect no good to befal her she is manifestly under the judicial Hand of GOD hardned to incur his Curse and to be a Curse to her Parents  Aunt  GOD's Ways are unsearchable sometimes our Falls are made the first Steps to our Recovery and the very particular Sins that we commit are the Introduction to our Deliverance from the Dominion of Sin in general therefore we can not conclude our selves Reprobate or any Body else till we see them past the Reach of Sovereign Grace  Husb  I wish as heartily for her as any one can do that she may repent but I cannot say that  I expect it  she has gone a dreadful Length  for one of her Age  Aunt  She may yet be a happy Convert  for all that  we have Instances of  worse than her  that have died Martyrs for him whose Name they had blasphemed  Husb  If ever she return her Repentance must be very bitter  Aunt  He that gives Repentance always Proportions the Degrees of it  Husb  But what is this Account you have to give me I doubt there is nothing of Repentance in it I expect rather to hear she is ruined  Mo  No no my Dear  thank GOD there is no bad News of her I had the same Fears for her not doubting but her Brother and she had pursued their usual Trade of Company and the Playhouse but  my Sister  assures me of the contrary  Aunt  Indeed Brother  I would ha' been very faithful to you  if it had been so  I would not have hid it from you besides I should not have let her stay'd in my House  but my News is quite of another Kind  Sister  pray tell it to my Brother  The Mother tells the whole Story as is before related  Fa  You are all mad  Aunt  What do you mean by mad  You must  xplain your self  or we shall think you are so  Husb  I cannot but think you all mad to go to Ruin a Gentleman at once  I'll have no Hand in so  icked a Thing  Aunt  I have no more to do than to carry your  nswer  Husb  I have more Respect for him  I assure you  nd should think it the worst Action that ever I  did in my Life if I should be Instrumental to bring such a young Man as he is into such a Snare I cannot do a Thing so dishonourable  Aunt  Why What do you take your Daughter to be  Husb  To be A Contemner of GOD a Despiser of Religion A Rebel to her Father given over to Vanity and obstinate  in all  These I have by sad Experience found in her what other Evils these may produce  GOD only knows  I should be sorry my Cousin should know by Experience nor can I be so unjust as to consent to his joining himself to one of my Children especially to one who having no Sense of  Filial Relation  can have little or none of a  Social Relation  one that can be ungrateful to her Father and insolent to a tender Mother can never suitably return the Kindness of an obliging Husband  Aunt  He knows the whole Case and all that you would have him know  I shall honestly tell him  for I will no more deceive him than you would  Husb  Does he know  that she is now in actual Rebellion against GOD in Defyance of her Father and Mother and that she has laid me under an absolute Necessity of having nothing at all to do with her or with him when he shall have taken her  Aunt  Yes  He knows all that  Fa  And what says he  to it  Aunt  He says  He will come and ask you Forgiveness for her  Fa  Repentance is never done by Proxy  Sister  a true Penitent is never backward to come himself  Aunt  Why  it is true  as he says  That for her to come now and submit her self is only sending her home to cry for a Husband or making her appear a Penitent for a Portion He desires your Consent  that he shall marry your Daughter and leaves all the rest to you  Fa  I can have no Concern with her nor  Assent  or  Dissent  to  or  from any Thing that concerns her any more than if she was no Relation to me till she returns to her Duty and appears truly and sincerely Penitent for her Crime She knows I am obliged to act thus and I think I owe so much to GOD to Religion and to the Duty of a Parent  Aunt  You will not however force her Repentance  Brother  I believe she is sensible she is wrong and I can see it plain enough but you know Brother  Repentance is the Gift of GOD  only I dare say your Daughter would be glad to ask you Pardon and the Affectionate Concern she speaks of it with  makes me think so  but to say she shall be a true Penitent towards GOD for her Offence against him neither  you  or  I  or  any Body alive  can answer for that Would you be willing I should bring her to acknowledge her Offence against you  Fa  Sister  I would have no Sollicitor in such a Case when her Repentance is sincere GOD will bring her upon her Knees to him and then she will soon come to me also and that is the Way I desire to have her brought  Aunt  Well  I am perswaded the sooner she marries my Son inLaw the sooner she will be brought to Repentance I am satisfied he will be no hindrance to her in the way of her Duty  Fa  Nor she any forwarding to him in the Way of his Duty  Alas  what a Family will there be among them  How will she  the Mistress of a Family  comply  to set up the Worship of GOD in her House that left her Father's House because she would not submit to serve GOD there How shall  she instruct her Children that would bear no Instruction her self and ridicul'd it in her Brothers and Sisters who were better inclin'd If he is told all this faithfully and sincerely I know he is a Religious Sober Gentleman and he can never so far forget himself as to think any more of such a Woman's being his Wife  Aunt  You are very hard to be  woo'd  methinks  Fa  My Difficulties are just and honourable It shall never be said that I first turned my Daughter out of Doors and then let him marry her  It is in Justice  to him that I say all this had she been deserving and dutiful and were I not satisfied in my Conscience that she will be his Ruin I should not have said so much nor made the least Objection to the Proposal  Aunt  If I had come of this Message before my Niece had disobliged you I believe you had thought it a good Settlement for your Daughter  Fa  Had it been before she had discovered her self to be what I think will ruin and destroy him I mean as to the Happiness of a Relation I acknowledge I should have thought very well of it and now I refuse it only as I think she is not fit to make him a Wife  Aunt  But  if we will venture  you will not oppose it  Fa  What mean ye by  we  If both the Young Man and his Father are plainly and honestly told what I say  and that I say it  or will give me leave to tell it them my self and will venture after that  I have no more to say  but as I said first  I will have no Hand in it  I can have nothing to say to her or about her till she alters her Behaviour She is you know out of my Hands  Aunt  Well I have no more to say but  I believe  we shall make a Wedding of it among us and perhaps she may be brought to her Duty afterwards Your Negative is not against  her  being married  to him  but against  his  being married  to her  which if they will venture we reckon we have your Consent as far as you can give it  Fa  I will have no Blame if she proves all that's wicked to him  Aunt  I'll clear you of that effectually I hope She may be yet a good Woman and make him a good Wife  Fa  He runs more Risque than a Granadier in storming a Counterscarp  Mo  The Grace of GOD  may  reclaim her I grant it tho' we see but small Hopes of it  However Sister  I engage you upon your Word to give a faithful Account hoth to your Son and to his Father of all I have told you of her Conduct how she has treated her Parents and how it may be expected she will treat her Husband and if after being thus fairly warned by us  you will all venture  we are honourably discharged you see we have no Objection on your Son's Account do as you please only let it be acknowledged that we have hid nothing from you  The End of the First Dialogue  The Second DIALOGUE  AS in the former Dialogue when the Aunt came to treat of a Marriage for the Daughter we had of Course the Mother telling us the History of the Conduct of her Son and Daughter  after their coming home from the Garden from their Walk under the LimeTrees  to the Time that both of them  so rudely  left their Father So in this Dialogue which is between the  Brother  and  Sister  we shall from their own Mouths have an Account of the Measures they both took afterwards  first as to her Part  till just before she went to be married and secondly as to his Part till just before he went into the Army and to his Travels  as he called them  What became of both afterwards we shall see in a Part by it self  The Brother  being now preparing for his Journey or Voyage and the Sister for her Wedding they mutually desired to converse together about those Things before they went on and the Brother making his Sister a Visit their first Conversation produces the following Dialogue  The Sister begins  with a Sigh  Sister  Well Brother  What is to become of us two methinks we are two odd People in the World  Bro  Truly so we are we look like Two Exiles or People rather gone into voluntary Banishment from their own Country  Sister  I'll tell you I have thought rather we are like Two Malecontent Courtiers who being disgusted at the Treatment they have received  have left the Court  and desire to retire  as they call it  into the Country  Brother  I think so too and I believe it is with them  as it is with us  or with me at least that they generally wish they had not done it afterwards  Sister  Why do you repent then  Bro  I don't say I repent  I think I have been ill used and that I gave no Reason for such violent Treatment but I cannot say I am glad it has happened there are many Things which make my present Condition less pleasant to me than it was before  Sister  Well  if you repent  why don't you go Home as the Prodigal did No doubt the old Man would kill the Fatted Calf to have you again  Bro  Ay  but I an't come to Feeding of Hogs yet and eating of Husks I don't know what I might do if it were come to that  Sister  Nor never will  I hope there's no danger of that Brother  Bro  I hope not  yet I must needs say  ever since I have fixed my self for my Travels my Heart has been very heavy and I dream every Night  the strangest Things  Sister  What need you be so concerned You have a good Estate of your own you are as well as if you were at Home  Brother  No  not so well neither  for  to go back to your Court simily  the discontened Courtier retires to his Estate in the Country and  there  he can live  very well  but still  Five or Six Thousand Pounds a Year at Court made a very good Addition and made him a great deal better so that he is always a Loser by quitting his Post  and so it is with me Sister  If I had stayed with my Father or gone abroad with his Consent I had been subsisted at his Expences or perhaps travelled at his Charge and then my own Estate would have encreased besides my Father sure  would not ha' Disinherited me for no other Crime but meerly having a little Estate of my own  But now I suppose he has done with me entirely and what's my Estate compared to living like a Gentleman  Sister  I did not think you had been troubled with the Hyppo  Brother of all Things  why you are quite cast down I never saw the like of you What must  I say  then if you talk thus  I that have nothing at all  but am kept here of Charity  Bro  No I han't the Hyppo I am not cast down but I tell you what Thoughts I have sometimes  Sister  Yes  and dreams too  you say what do they come from but from the Hyppo I believe you have got the Vapours pray what did you Dream  Bro  I Dream a Thousand Things not worth Naming but however one Dream was so particular I cannot but tell it you tho' perhaps you'll banter me for it too but I'll tell it you because you were a little concerned in it and acted a Part in it  Sister  Pray what was it  Bro  Why you know I suppose That I have bought me a Commission  Sister  I know  You  said that you intended it but I did not know you had done it I would not ha' had you done that methinks I would not ha' had you been a Soldier on many Accounts what  need have you to go into the Army to be knock'd in the Head  Bro  Well  that is not the Case now  we'll talk of that another Time  I have done it  Sister  But what's that to your Dream  Bro  Why the same Night that I had bought my Commission I had this  ugly Dream  It seemed to me that I had been some Time in the Army and had met with many Wounds and Misfortunes But at last I had one of my Arms shot off and had been a long while under Cure and Sick so that I was reduced to a meer Skelleton  Sister  All  Hyppo  All  Hyppo  It is nothing in the World else  Bro  Well  but this was not all for I was reduced to such mean Circumstances and so Poor that I had not Necessaries and was in the miserablest Condition that ever you heard of and after Suffering a great many Hardships I wrote to my Father to relieve me and he  Sister  Refused  I warrant that  I know it's like him  Bro  NO NO  he did not do so neither  you run too fast  he sent me Money enough to bring me over to  England  and I was brought in a Coach to his Door but he would not let me be brought in but ordered me to be carried to a Neighbours House where  after an ordinary manner  I was taken Care of and supplyed with Necessaries  tho' meanly enough  and this Part put me into the greatest Passion that I thought if any thing had been in my Way I would have murdered my self  Sister  It was very barbarous Usage indeed  the more like the rest of his doings with us  but where's the Part I was to act in this melaucholly Scene  Bro  Why  Good  and  Generous  like your self  you  no sooner heard of my Condition but you came to Visit me  Sister  And  what could I do  what Condition was I in to help you Was I reconciled to my Father  If you thought so  I believe your Dream will never come to pass  Bro  Yes yes  you were married kept your Coach and lived gallantly you came to me very chearful and gay but very grave in your Carriage you told me you were very sorry for my Condition but you were sensible we had both been in the Wrong and had pulled down the heavy Judgment of GOD upon me by our Disobedient Carriage to our Father  Sister  Could  I be  such a Brute  Bro  Nay you spoke kindly enough to me otherwise and gave me a handful of Gold for my Supply but talked mighty Religiously to me about our Usage of my Father  Sister  It's a Sign it was a Dream Religion and  a great deal of Gold  Alas Brother it's all a Dream to be sure I shall never have much of either of them But go on  Bro  I ask'd you  why my Father carried it so severe to me  now  when he saw me in that Condition  you said  I might remember my Father had solemnly engag'd himself that if I went away I should never set my Foot within his doors again but as a Penitent and unless he was satisfied that I acknowledged my Error I could not expect he would break those Engagements nor would he see me till he had an Answer to it in positive Terms  I asked you  how then he came to be reconciled to you  for his Resentment was equal at us both  and we were both in the same Fact  Sister  Ay and what said I to this  Bro  You told me with Tears  That you were not ashamed to say you had heartily repented of it and had asked Forgiveness of God and your Father  a Thousand Times That you were sensible we had both offended God and abused the Tenderness of the best of Fathers and you never had done an Action which gave you so much Peace in your Life as when you came upon your Knees to my Father and begged his Pardon in the Face of all the Family and if I had any Sense of Religion or of Natural Duty  you hoped  I would do so too and that you came on Purpose to perswade me to it  Sister  This is  not a Dream only  But a Dream that I am sure will never come to pass at least my Part of it and I hope yours will not either  is there any more of it  Bro  You said a great deal more to the same Purpose that I cannot repeat  Sister  I hope you minded none of it  Bro  I cannot say  that it has made no Impressions upon me in Spight of all my Opposition to it for I hate to give Way to such Things  Sister  How did it end did you submit  Bro  I do not remember either that I submitted or that my Father did any Thing for me I remember this tho' that your Arguments did not move me much and your Example less I could not see much Reason for Penitence and I could not be Hypocrite enough to Counterfeit it and I bad you tell my Father  If I had offended him I was very sorry and asked his Pardon  But you told me you feared that would not be sufficient so you went away and I remained as miserable as I was before  till I awaked  and was very glad it was but a Dream  Sister  Dear Brother  I don't value Dreams and  of all Dreams  such a wild one as this which I am satisfied can never come to pass but I'll tell you  what Use I'll make of it and that is to desire you to make it impossible to come to pass  Bro  How's that  Sister  By resolving not to go into the Army  Bro  That cannot be it is too late now  Sister  That's as much as to say  there is a Fate upon you  and you  must go  By the same Rule of fatal Necessity  which some People harp much upon  all your Dream may be under a Necessity of coming to pass  Bro  It may be so  for ought I know  Sister  You give me the Vapours with but thinking of it  Bro  What can I do  How can I help it now  Sister  Why  I tell you how you may help it  do not go  Bro  But I tell you I have bought a Troop of Dragoons  Sister  What then  you may sell it again  Brother  That is not Honourable I should be laugh'd at  Sister  You have no Occasion in the World to act thus You have an Estate and may live happily and settle your Mind what may come this Way no body can tell the other Way you were out of Danger this Way your Dream may come good for ought I know  Bro  Now  you  have got the Hyppo  Sister  Sister  Why  such a Dream  and  such a Circumstance  is enough to give any body the Vapours I cannot think of your going to be murdered in the Army if it had been my Lot and I had been a Man there had been some Sense in it  She weeps  Bro  Why you any more than me  Sister  Why because you have an Estate  as I told you before  I have nothing at all but am turned  out of my Father's House and am kept here in Charity  as it were  Bro  Charity  Why I hear you are going to be married  Sister  Married Who do you think will have me without any Portion  Bro  Why I hear Young Mr my Aunt's SoninLaw  Courts you  Sister  There has been something talk'd of about it indeed but that was as  I suppose  if this Breach had not happened  As it has  he knows better than to take me  and if it had not  I should ha' known better than to have had him  Bro  Why  as to the last  I think you are wrong he is a very pretty Gentleman has a very good Estate and you have been acquainted with his Humour  you know he is a sober sensible good temper'd Man  Sister  Ay Brother  but you know Sir  Anthony  Bro  But you know  Sister  on the other Hand Sir  Anthony's  Character is so bad and his Estate but indifferent and entangled too So that you had no Room to think  That my Father tho' you and he had not differed  would ever have been brought to like it  Nor would he ha' been in the Right if he had  for Sir  Anthony  could have made you no Settlement and besides he is a Rake I wonder you could fancy him  Sister  Well all that's over now  I am a fitter Match for my Uncle's Coachman than for my Uncle's Eldest Son  Bro  That's all Hyppo too Sister  prithee be as free with me as I am with you tell me that Case  I know something of it  I know you may have him if you will notwithstanding all your Circumstances as for the Family Quarrel he knows of it and yet he is so in Love with you  he'll take you whether you have any Portion or no and venture reconciling your Father afterwards  I think he offers fair  Sister  Indeed he said so to me which was very obliging  I confess  Bro  What could you say to him in Return  Sister  I told him I would not do him so much Harm I was too much his Friend  Bro  That was a mock Friendship and what he did not thank you for  I suppose  what else could you say  Sister  I told him  very plainly  I would not be so much in Debt to any Husband as to have him take me without a Portion I would not put it into a Husband's Power to reproach me with having had nothing with me  Bro  Come tell me the whole Discourse now  I know you was able to keep him at Arms End a great while with your Tongue  Sister  You are mistaken in me  and more in him  I assure you  Bro  Go on  and tell me the utmost Opposition you could make of that Kind  Sister  No  as you served me about your Dreams  so I'll do now with you  I won't trouble you with those single Banters which were of no Use but I'll tell you the main Debate because you are a little concerned in it too  as I was in your Dream  Bro  With all my Heart  Sister  Why after he had Two or Three Times proposed Marriage to me and my Aunt had pressed me to a serious Consideration of it I took the Liberty to speak my Mind very freely to him  one Night  and to her too  In short  I made my Aunt downright angry with me but I could get nothing from him but what I confess was kinder than  as I told him  I ever intended to deserve and what  was so very obliging that I confess I think my self very rude to him  I wonder he could bear it  Bro  I know he is a most obliging good humoured Gentleman and you ought not to have used him ill  Sister  Well  I used him ill enough for all that I asked him first if he knew the Occasion of my being at their House  He said  yes he did  I told him  I did not believe it  Bro  That was rude indeed it was unmannerly  Sister  Sister  No  I was not rude that Way neither I did not give him the Lye but I went on  immediately  I told him That he might perhaps know that it was a Breach between my Father and me but did not suppose  as I did  That it was a Breach that was impossible ever to be made up  he look'd a little surpriz'd at that  and said nothing but my Aunt took me up short and said  don't say so Niece I hope it shall easily be made up  No Madam  said I  it can never be made up I thought you all went upon a wrong Notion and therefore it was that  I said  I did not believe it when Mr said he knew the Affair of the Breach  Bro  But why would you lay it down  so positively  That it could never be made up  Sister  Why  I told them plainly my Father thought me guilty of an unpardonable Fault and I thought my self guilty of no Fault art all My Father thought me  disobedient  and I thought him  unnatural  My Father had vowed never to receive me without Repentance and I had resolved never to repent and so it was impossible we could be reconciled  Bro  That was laying it down  very plainly  indeed what could they say  Sister  My Aunt was very warm with me indeed I thought she would ha' been downright angry at my saying  I would never repent  She alledged I ought not to say so in any Case whatsoever  I was as warm as she and told her  if I was convinc'd I was in the wrong I should repent of Course of that or any Thing else  If I was not  I could never repent by Violence that Fathers might sin against Children as well as Children against Parents I would ha' said more but I broke out into Tears and could not talk  Bro  You were too warm  you would ha' argued it better if you had been calmer  Sister  She moved me by seeming to condemn me as I thought without arguing but when she saw me concerned she said she was sorry to see Things come to such Height and that if it was so she was almost of my Mind  that it would never be made up  after which she added  what vexed me worse than all the rest  these Words  viz what then do you intend to do Child  This nettled me worse as I said than all For it look'd as if she had said  I was not to expect to live always there  at which I returned  a little too short  I confess  Go away Madam when ever you are a weary of me  Bro  Fye Sister  you should not ha' done so for I know she is very kind to you and loves you very well  Sister  That's true  but I was vex'd  However  I asked her Pardon afterwards  as you shall hear  Bro  How did she take it  then  Sister  Calmly and obligingly enough  I see  Cousin said she  you are moved  I will take nothing ill from you and therefore we will say no more of it now I hope Ways may be found to Accommodate Things between you and your Father  still  and I will be very glad to be Instrumental  to bring it to pass for you for your own Sake  Bro  That was kind and very much like her for she is a very good Woman  Sister  It was so  and moved me so much the other Way  That I went to her immediately and kist her and asked her Pardon for being so rude to her and would have kneeled but she would not let me  Bro  And was the young Gentleman there to see all this  Sister  Yes he was  and then it was That as I said he behaved so very obligingly to me he told his Mother for he seemed to speak  to her  rather than to me That he had found out a Way effectually to reconcile my Father and me if I would approve of it I told him I could not but approve of any reasonable Way to be reconciled to my Father for no body could suppose it was pleasant to me to be turned out of my Father's House be look'd upon like a Vagabond and having no Fortune or Subsistance be left to go to Service or be kept as it were upon Charity He turned short to me upon this and said you know Madam the Offers of Marriage I have made to you your Aunt  my Kind Mother here  knows I am sincere in the Proposal if you accept me let all the Breach lye on me if when your Father and I debate it he insists that you are in the wrong I'll ask him Forgiveness in your stead and I doubt not to prevail upon him to accept of it if you do not appear in the wrong and yet he should be obstinate I'll endeavour to make up the Loss of a Father to you by doing every Thing I can to make you forget the Affliction that is past and I assure you I shall never enquire whether he will give you any Portion or no  Bro  Was it possible for you to Answer any Thing to so kind a proposal when made in such serious Terms certainly you could not Banter him than Sister as you did before  Sister  No I did not Banter him  I answered him thus  I told him that his Offer was too much for him to make and too much for me to refuse without an Apology for not making him a suitable return but that he and I yet differed about the main Question  viz What it was my Father and I parted about  and perhaps he and I should part about the same For if before hand I knew that he was against my Part then he was not able to be an Advocate but only took upon him to bear the Ignominy of a Submission for me which was a Work I was not willing to put upon him and a Debt I was not willing to owe him That I had  too much  Respect for him to suffer him to do the first and  too little  to Load my self with the Obligation of the last That on the other Hand if he justified me and believed my Father in the Wrong all the Thoughts of reconciling of my Father were at an End That as to taking me without it I told him  as I told you just now  That I seemed a fitter Match for one of his Father's Footmen than for  his Father  's  eldest Son  and had too much Respect for the Family to fill up such a Place upon such mean Conditions  Bro  But he might have answered all that  by telling you  he took all that Part upon himself  Sister  He did so  and told me  he would make the same Settlement upon me as if I had my Father's Blessing and a Portion and he would apply himself for both afterwards  Bro  What could you say to that  Sister  I turned then to my Aunt for this was a publick Communing  it was no Courtship at all  I asked her thus Madam there is another impossibility in the Way that you know of which really ought to prohibit my speaking it and that is this Tho' this Breach happened between my Father and me and I seem now  as it were  to be out of his Government  yet I do not think my self at Liberty by it to dispose of my self without his Leave or Consent or at least without asking it If upon any such Motion he Answers  Let her do what she pleases as she has put her self out of my Care so she shall be out of my Concern  if he says so indeed I shall know then what I have to do  but  till such  or some other  Answer is obtained from my Father I don't think the Question ought so much as to be asked of me at least if it be I ought to give no other Answer to it  Bro  That was very Respectfully answer'd  as to my Father  What followed  Sister  My Aunt answered me  Leave that to me Child I'll answer for that  I answered I shall leave it to you with all my Heart Madam but I can make no Answer then till you shall be pleased to let me know  when I am  at Liberty to Answer and  when not  Well  Niece said my Aunt  to put you out of pain about that I have talk'd with your Father and Mother already about it I find them indeed very Angry and dissatisfied with their Daughter but upon no other Account backward or unwilling to the proposal well Madam  said I  a little surpriz'd then you have gone further in this matter than I imagined and  what's next  said I next Child  says she  why if you would go along with me and speak but one Word to your Father nay half so much as you did to me just now  for no Cause at all  it would be all over and if the Family was uneasy to you upon any other Account we should fetch you out of it again in as  short a Time as you could desire  Do Child says  the good old Lady  I'll introduce you I'll make half your Submission  for you  Bro  Indeed I'd ha' gone with her  I wonder at you  if any one would do half so much for me I'd go to morrow Morning as far as things are gone with me  Sister  Well  I was once of the mind to have gone too  but I did not  Bro  What could you say to her  Sister  I said these very Words  Madam I find a greater Obstacle here than before and I don't know but if it had not been on this Account I should ha' been glad of your Offer but do you think my Father shall say That whereas I would not submit to him upon the just Foundation on which he differed with me yet that I could come home to cry for a Husband  No Madam  no one on Earth shall say that of me I am not in such Distress yet  Bro  I should never ha' made that Scruple indeed Sister you are wondrous nice  Sister  Why Brother What would you think of any young Lady that should make Way for your Addresses upon such low Terms would you not think them very Fond  Bro  No indeed and he would not either I dare say  Sister  I resolved I would not put my self so much at his Mercy  Bro  What said he to it  Sister  He said what was  like himself  very obliging he told me  That now I laid a double Affliction upon him for I made him that was willing to do any thing in the World to bring about my Return to my Father be the only Obstacle in the way of it  I told him he knew how to remove that Obstacle very easily which was by thinking no more of  me and perhaps in Time I might see my Mistake and by my Aunt's Mediation make my Peace with my Father or my Father might abate his rigorous Humour and it might go off again without it or if neither happened as I was not a Wife fit for a Gentleman and was too proud to take up with a Footman I was in no haste I could remain as I was  Bro  You were extravagantly stiff  Sister  Why really Brother I think my Circumstance requires it more than if I had been in my Father's House  for to have consented one Moment sooner for my Condition  had been the same thing as to be taken in Charity besides I foresaw the dispute we should have about what our Family Breach began upon and to which this was but the Introduction and therefore I was resolved to be open and free with them before Hand whether we came to agree at last or no and as I have told you all this only to bring in the other so I'll omit all the rest of our Discourse and come to that Point  Bro  Do so  for I think you said I was a little concerned in it  Sister  So you are  but not much  Well Mr and my Aunt too said a great many very kind things to me after that but at last I turned to my Aunt  Madam says I  I cannot but think all our Discourse remote and foreign and since you will have me speak of a Thing which I never had any Thoughts of I ought to be very plain and free  especially since you are pleased to give me Leave  Do so  my dear  said my Aunt Why then Madam said I we are talking of reconciling me to my Father and  as I told you  I shall be very glad of it but as to making that Reconciliation a Means to what Mr proposes I do not see it will be any thing  to the Purpose  why so Niece  says my Aunt Why Madam  said I  this was the Reason why I have two or three times asked Mr if he rightly understood the Reasons and Circumstances of the Breach between me and my Father He was pleased to say he did  tho' I can hardly think it  Now Madam  says I  it is my Opinion that Mr and I shall differ as much  about the same Things  as my Father and I did tho' perhaps not with so much unkindness  especially if we differ about it before hand  and therefore it is best Fighting that Battle  before  than  after  for you see I can deliver my self from the Fury of a Father but I know not my Case  if it had been a Husband  Besides  Madam  I think it is honester and kinder to Mr to have all this Matter settled and disputed  now  than to leave things to hereafter when I shall have neither Liberty  to go away  nor freedom of Speech  at Home  which would be to make my  bad Case  ten times worse than it is  Bro  What said your Aunt to this  Sister  She was stunned at it  at First  and seemed willing to have put it off to another Time which she afterwards told me was because she was afraid my Case should be represented too much to my Disadvantage Mr seeing his Mother too backward to talk of it thought there might be something she would not have him hear and withdrew  which I was not pleas'd with  for since I saw they would make a Match of it and I saw no great Reason to be averse or at least obstinately so I was willing to come to a certainty and know what kind of Life I was to live for I was resolved I would no more be  a married Nun  than I would be a  Cloistered Daughter  however he being withdrawn my Aunt and I began the following  Discourse which I'll give you as short as I can My Aunt spoke first  thus  Aunt  Come Child now my Son is gone let me be plain with you and pray take all the Freedom and Liberty with me that you would now if your Brother was here and let us talk of this Matter for I would not have you stand in your own Light  again  You see how things stand with you and your Father and  as you said before  I doubt it will be hard to bring you to an Accommodation but this Match will make you entirely easy  Niece  Madam said I as you give me a Liberty to speak freely I hope you will not take it ill that I am very plain I have no particular Objection against the Match with your Son  as to himself  indeed I did not look upon it at first to be a serious Proposal but since you assure me it is and as you are now instead both of a Father and a Mother to me I shall give my self up to be entirely dispos'd by you only My present Difficulties relate to my own Circumstances and the Ground and Reason of the Breach with my Father seems to me to be a plain Foundation of the like with my Husband If I should ever marry Mr which would make me more miserable than I am now  Aunt  You must explain your self  Child  I know the Breach between you and your Father was begun about Religion and the Reformation of his Family which he has happily Effected and which you and your Brother opposed I am loath to bring those things to your Mind I observe they always bring Tears into your Eyes  Things were carried too high  we all have thought you were in the Wrong  but that is not the Case now  Niece  Pardon me  Madam  said I  that is just the Case now  and as you have heard Parties against me so I doubt not you will hear me too for while you believe me in the Wrong Mr and I can never be Right suppose I should do just by him as I did by my Father what then  Aunt  I hope you will not  my Dear  Niece  No Madam indeed I will not I will not go away from him but to prevent that I will never have him till he and I adjust the matter  as to what  Liberty I may expect and  what not  for I will never marry  as I said  to be my Husband's  Cloistered Wife  any more than I would stay at Home to be my  Father's Nun  Aunt  Why Child your Difference with your Father as I understand it was that when he set up the Worship of GOD in his Family you would not join with him but made a Scoff at his Resolution of reforming his Family and several such Things  Niece  Did I not say  Madam  That I believe Mr and you also had not had a fair Account of the Thing I cannot wonder  Madam  that you thought me in the wrong I wonder Mr could think of me for a Wife if I had been such a Daughter  Aunt  Come Child undeceive me then and let me hear it all  Niece  No  Madam  let me only let you hear it Right My Father and Mother had bred up me and my Brother as you know till we were come to be what we call Men and Women We had been used to Company to good Manners to Converse in the World with People of Quality and good Breeding and were come to an Age in which we might be thought fit to be  trusted with so much of the Government of our selves as to be past Schooling and Tutelage We made no other use of those Liberties than became a modest Behaviour they can charge us with nothing Criminal or Scandalous No Vice nothing injurious to our Reputation when all of a sudden without any Notice we were fallen upon abridged of all lawful Liberties were to have new Lectures of Family Discipline read to us which we were absolutely to submit to and to commence Children again  This you may be sure we thought hard  and my Share was immediately to fall under Correction for my Mother without any Provocation  as I thought  flew to my Closet took away all my Books and flung them in the Fire and laid her Hands upon me into the Bargain this I thought  at my Age  was unreasonable Usage  Aunt  Well Child but  you say  you made no ill use of your Liberties whereas you went every LORD's Day abroad to the Park and a visiting you went every Day almost to the Play spent your time at home in playing at Cards reading Plays and the like  Niece  It is true  Madam  we did so but we did not reckon these unlawful Liberties  Madam  nor  do I yet  think so  Aunt  I am sorry for that  my dear  I am quite of another mind  Niece  But Madam  if they were so  who gave us the Example Who bred us up in that Liberty Did not  my Father  and  Mother  always go out with us to the Park a Sundays and go with us to the Play Nay did they not lead us into it by their Example and did not my Mother give me most of those very Books she threw in the Fire  out of her own Closet  if this was a  wicked Course why had they not brought us up otherways and not introduced us to it themselves  Aunt  My Child  they own they were in the wrong  and that is their Grief  I have heard them express themselves with Tears and a just Sorrow on that Account And they are forward enough to charge themselves with it as the Cause of all the Obstinacy of you and your Brother in resisting their measures of Reformation and you should not Reproach them  my dear  with what they repent of  Niece  I do not Reproach them perhaps they have Cause for their Repentance  but still  it may be allowed for a Reason against their so violently driving us into their new Measures and breaking us off from all our Friends and Society  at once  without any other Reason but that they thought fit to have it so  if we had been little Children  it had been another Case  Aunt  I cannot but be against you  Cousin  in it tho' that part may seem hard to you for if the Thing was necessary and just you could not justify so great a Breach with your Father and Mother for the manner of it  Niece  This is what I look'd for Madam and is the Reason why I mention'd it for if Mr thinks to go on with what my Father has begun  I am no Wife for him to be sure  if I were why should I come away from my Father  Aunt  Why if you were married to my Son would you refuse to have him pray to GOD in his Family or to join with him if he did  indeed Cousin  I love you very well  but I have so much Respect for him also  and above all so much Zeal for the keeping up the Face of Religi+on in Families that I could not in Conscience b  for the match  Niece  If  Madam  that had been the Quarrel between my Father and me  why did I come to your House  do I scruple going to Prayers with you all here Did I omit going to Church with my Father or do I omit it here you are satisfied I knew the Orders of your Family before I came hither  This makes it plain  it was not that made the Dispute but the manner of his Acting and abridging us of all those Liberties he had bred us up in and then beginning a new Discipline when he ought to have allowed us to be past Discipline why had he not without all that Ceremony and those Severities upon us called his Family to Prayers and called us in do you think Madam we would have run away or have left our Father because of his going to Prayers  Aunt  Well  Niece  tho' he might ha' done so yet I cannot think  you were in the Right of it  nor your Brother neither who I hear insults his Father very rudely since because he has an Estate without him but I fear that young Gentleman  will come to want Bread yet  unless his Father help him I am perswaded I shall live to see him  brought to his Father's door in as bad a Condition as the Prodigal tho' without the Prodigal's Repentance  I wish I am not too true a Prophetess  Niece  This very thing is the Reason Madam why I am so willing to speak of this Case before I can talk any thing to the Purpose about Mr  Aunt  Why  Child  what does this relate to him  be knows it all and we know it all  and yet we are willing he should make you his Wife if these things do not hinder on his Side sure they can never hinder on your Side  Niece  I think just the contrary Madam and  I beg you will bear with me in speaking it plainly  it's true he knows all this as well as you do but  if he believes me in the wrong too as you do I would be glad to know how  I that think my self in the Right  am to live with him in the Case of such Liberties which I justify and he condemns  to be sure  if I thought them not justifiable I would go Home to my Father this Minute and ask his Pardon upon my Knees and if I continue to think them justifiable I shall think it more hard to be abridged by my Husband than I did by my Father And this is the Difficulty I mentioned before  Aunt  Why Child what Liberties do you mean or what would you speak of in such a Case I hope you would desire no unlawful unbecoming Liberties especially when you were a Wife and a Mistress of a Family  Niece  I hope not Madam  nor any unbecoming Restraints neither  and that is the Reason of my Discourse he may think himself willing to run the Risque of the first but I am not willing to run the Risque of the last for our power of acting under them will be by no Means equal  Just at this Word the young Gentleman comes in again  Aunt  Here's my Son let him Answer for himself State your Objection  Niece  No Madam you can do it much better  The Aunt repeats the very Words to him  Son  I wonder  Madam  you should think I should practise Restraints with you I see nothing in your Conversation that prepares me to expect you can want a Restraint or that bids me fear it  Niece  I may be a worse  Wife  than I am a  Cousin  as I have been a worse Daughter to my  Father  than I have been a Niece to my  Aunt  Son  I am not so willing to suppose that as I am well satisfied of the contrary  Niece  But I would know what Restraints I am to expect  Son  You can hardly mention upon  what Occasion  Niece  Upon the very probable Occasion of my being a  bad Wife  Son  That's a general Head and yet you shall have a particular Answer to it Madam I know no practical Restraints that a Husband can  honestly make use of  but those of Entreaties Perswasions and kind Reasonings and those I know you would allow  Niece  You are capable of learning tho' you may know no other yet  Son  Pray Madam be so particular then as to Name some of the Cases in which you apprehend I shall restrain you  Niece  Perhaps I will go to the Play  what will you do  you won't go with me  Son  To the Door Madam  to see you safe  I should  Niece  Perhaps when you will go to Prayers I go a visiting  Son  If you won't let me pray  with you  Madam I hope you'll let me pray  for you  Niece  Suppose I have a Mind to go to the Park a Sundays  Son  I'll shew you the Reasons why I dare not go with you and use all the Entreaties and Perswasions I can with you not to act so much against your own Conscience and I hope to prevail with you too But to wave such Suggestions upon the whole  Madam  it is my principle and I believe it will be my practice That between  Man  and  Wife  no Violence  can be justified  but that of  affectionate tender perswasion and a reasoning Importunity My Disposition does not lead me to Rudeness all the Government and all the Obedience of the married State that I have any Notion of consists in the Dominion of Love and the Subjection of Love what Monster I may be transformed into I cannot say  but this is my judgment  and I perswade my self  you are not  apprehensive of the rest any more  than I am  apprehensive of your acting as you say you will  Sister  This Brother was the Substance of our Discourse and an odd sort of Courting you'll say it was  and thus the Case stands now  what I shall resolve to do in it I know not what would you advise me to  Bro  I'll be very plain with you Sister  If you were in as good Terms with your Father as ever you were yet if this had offered then I would have advised you to have had him if ever you expected to be happy He is a sober virtuous generous spirited Gentleman and such a one can never use you ill  I know you love Sir Anthony  but you are undone  if ever you have him  for he is a Brute and a Beggar he only wants your Money and if he marries you he has neither Estate to maintain you Sence to entertain you or Manners to use you well  Sister  I believe I shall take your Advice  truly  but I shall not be too hasty  Bro  I am glad to see you in so fair a Way to come off of this ugly Family Broil  Sister  I do not see that this will bring me off of it  at all  My Father will be the same Man  Bro  Yes yes  it will bring you off he'll bring you to be reconciled and my Aunt will work another Way  and if it should be impossible  still you are provided for  Sister  I can't say but I shall be provided for  yet I own I shall never enjoy my self  for whether I am Right or Wrong I cannot say I am easy to be at such a Variance as not to be in speaking Terms with my own Father and Mother  Bro  That's just my Case I know not what I shall do to go Abroad and perhaps may never see them again and not so much as see them or have their Blessing or take my Leave of them I know not what to do in it  Sister  Dear Brother then why will you go I think you take the wrongest Step in the World  Bro  In what Child  Sister  To go into the Army What Occasion have you for it you told me you should only go to Travel  Bro  Well  be easy  I am going to Travel first  for a Year  I design to go into  Italy  Sister  But you must go to the Army at last  Bro  Ay  but not a great while yet tho' perhaps time enough to make my Dream good  Sister  My Aunt's Words came into my head when you told me that ugly Dream I wish there be not something in it at last if you did not go into the Army I should not be afraid of it  Bro  I do not love to heed Dreams  Sister  I have heard our Minister say there is a just Medium to be observed in the giving heed to Dreams  viz That we should not lay too much Stress upon them and yet not wholly slight them  Bro  I observe the Dreams that signify bad things are true oftenest I dreamed exactly  about a Week before it happened  of our Breach with my Father  Sister  Here comes my  Aunt  we must talk no more of that now  The End of the Second Dialogue  The Third DIALOGUE  THE two last Dialogues are to be understood to be a Recapitulation of what had been acted some time past in order to introduce this part and preserve the Connection of the History The Daughter is now to be talked of as having been married some Time The Son was gone to Travel and having been returned into  Flanders  was gone to his Post in the Army where being in the Confederate Service and commanded out upon Action he fell in with a Party of the  French  and being very much wounded in the Fight was taken Prisoner and carried to  Cambray  from whence he wrote his Sister a Letter of which in its Course  The new married Couple had for above two Years lived together as they were at first with his Father and her Aunt during which Time she had had two Children and the Treatment she had met with there had been so kind so diverting and so obliging That she could have no Reason to say that they had not perform'd fully the Engagement her Husband had made with her to endeavour to make her forget the Affliction of the Breach with her Father  Her Husband carried it with so much Tenderness and Affection to her as was capable to engage and win a Temper far more Refractory than hers and by his obliging Carriage he prevented many little Excursions which her Inclination would otherways have led her too yet two things remained st She could not perswade herself to like a regular kind of Family Government She loved Company which she had been accustomed to and a little to Play and when she made her Visits would sometimes stay at Cards or other Diversions very late d She could not bear to think of stooping to own her Misbehaviour to her Father or to make any Submission to him nor could her Husband tho' he failed in no Endeavour bring that Breach to an End without it  As her Family encreased and on the other Hand her Ways were not very agreeable to the Family she was in it seemed necessary to think of settling themselves apart and her Husband having a very good House of his own near the City it was resolved they should do so and accordingly as we say they began Housekeeping  And now began the Tryal of her Husband's Temper and Patience to the utmost The Case was thus Being now to be a Master of a Family he was obliged to take upon him the Charge of Family Government he had not only been religiously educated  but as has been before observed  was a very serious religious Gentleman himself it was his Affliction that he found very little Complasance in his Wife to any thing that was religious and therefore he entred into no Conference with her about establishing the Orders of his Family but as soon as his House was furnished and his Family removed he resolved like a true Christian to begin with the Worship of God in his House and that he  might leave no room to her to dispute it he did this without so much as mentioning it to his Wife as if it was a thing which it ought to be taken for granted was as naturally and necessarily to be done in a Family as providing Food and Conveniences for their Subsistance however as if to make this more Eligible and to introduce it without any seeming Imposition upon his Wife he invited his Father and Mother and a Minister who was their Acquaintance to sup with them  the first Night of their Housekeeping  and before Supper his Wife being in the Room he askt the Minister aloud  if he would please to be their Chaplain for that Night  The Wife could not offer to oppose it tho' he could easily perceive she look'd a little strange at it so the Minister as had been concerted gladly accepting the Offer Books were brought in the Servants called together and Family Prayers performed  the first Night  after this was done and Supper over he invited the Minister  who it seems lived in the Country  to stay two or three Days with him which he also accepted so of Course Prayers were had every Night and Morning while the Minister stay'd and thus the Worship of God was quietly introduced into the Family and after the Minister was gone the Servants to whom it was no Novelty having been all in the Family before came of Course together at the usual Hour and he performed it himself  His Wife who was more disgusted at his taking no notice of it to her than at the thing it self  as if it was a beginning of some new Method which he intended to take with her  took a great many Ways to let him see she was not very well pleas'd sometimes at the usual Time when he would say  Come call in the Servants  She would give a Smile as a Signal of Contempt often she would be busy above Stairs  and not come down at all very often tho' she would come she would make him wait a good while and when she came into the Room would say with some Disdain  what need you ha' staid for me  However  he took no Notice of all this  and tho' she strove by all the Ways she could to have made him speak of it first yet he shunned it resolving not to have any Dispute with her  if it were possible to avoid it  but she soon took Care to make it unavoidable  Being become now a Mistress of a Family he hoped she would have had some Consideration for the Station she was in and have appeared with a little of that Gravity and Authority that became her but on the contrary she intirely omitted all Appearance of any such thing she visited oftner than ever she play'd at Cards abroad two or three Times a Week and  at home  as often as she could get Company she went almost nightly to the Play in short she began to lead a Life so different from the rest of the Family and so uneasie to him and all his and her Friends That it was greatly afflicting and perplexing to him  During all this Time he treated her with the utmost Tenderness and the most obliging Carriage that was possible only it could not be conceal'd neither from her nor from all the House that his Wife's Conduct was an extreme Affliction to him  and the more  because he saw no possible method to go about to Reclaim her  His Wife finding her self unrestrained grew still worse and at length contented not her self to give her vanity its full swing but appeared discontented that he would not do the like If she went to the Play he would sometimes go with her to the Door  as he had said he would when he courted her  but would not go in which she pretended she took  very ill of him when he visited any where  with her  where he saw her resolved to stay late at Cards he would excuse himself and leave her and it was much if she did not Flout him before the Company in some such manner as this  what you want to go home and sa your Prayers  which he would turn off with a Smile or a Jest and withdraw but still these things were very grievous to him  During all this and much more  nothing anger'd her so much  as that he would not take the Case into Debate with her but he resolved to go on in the Duties of a Master in his Family and to give her no Occasion to say he used her amiss so that all this while he said nothing to her till at last she began with him upon the following Occasion  His eldest Child a fine little Boy was now almost three Years old He had been but too well assured That his Wife took little Care to Teach the Child any Thing that might lay an early foundation of a religious Knowledge in its Mind wherefore upon all Opportunities he would be talking to the little Creature in such Language as was fittest for him to understand  viz Of who made him  and  who Redeemed him what God was  and  that he must serve God  and he like  as is usual to say to little Children  and his Wife takes that Opportunity to break in upon him one Day in pursuance of her former Resolution and began with him while he was talking to his little Son in the following Manner  Wife  So Mr  You are worthily imployed  Hus  My Dear  I hope it's no ill Imployment  Wife  No no  only suitable to that absolute Governmen of your Family which you entred upon at your beginning to keep House  Hus  My dear  I hope I have not encroached upon your Province  Wife  No no  my Province to be sure I am not fit to instruct a Child of three Years old  Hus  My speaking to the Child to let him know  who made him  and  who Redeemed him  and  who he was Born to serve  was a Thing so innocent and I thought so natural That I wonder it should offend you  my dear  Wife  No no  Offend me Why should it offend me you know I cannot do it my self having never been taught any thing till I was almost Years old  Hus  Tho' you have had Knowledge enough  my dear  yet I have heard you say it had been better if your Father had begun earlyer with his Family and that it had prevented the Breach that has happened since  Wife  Yes yes  and made you have a better Wife  Hus  My dear  you never heard me Complain  Wife  No  your Reproofs are Silent but very legible and easie to be understood  Hus  Wherein  my dear  do I reprove you  Wife  Only by taking all your Family Measures without consulting your Wife as one not worth having her Consent asked in the Matter or rather not capable of giving it  Hus  What Family Measures do you mean  my dear  we have not been six Months in a Family yet and I know not one single thing in the House that I have ordered without you  Wife  Not one Thing  why  did not you bring home your Chaplain without me and set up your Family Orders without me why was not I worthy being spoken to about it I suppose you fancied I would oppose it  as you had once a Notion I did at my Fathers  and so you treated me as if I were first an Atheist that would oppose any thing that was good or religious and dly An upper Servant  whose Business was not to join in making Orders but to submit to them when made  But I don't trouble you much at your Devotions  Hus  It is my great Missortune that you have kept this in your Mind so long and not let me know  that you took Offence at it  before Nothing was ever done with more Innocence of Intention or construed in a more contrary Manner to my Meaning I could have no thought that you would oppose the natural Duty of all Creatures to worship and serve  the Being that created them  how could I have such a thought of you  my dear  when I know you always willingly joined with us at my Fathers and when I heard you declare to your Aunt that the coming to Prayers was no part of the thing which made the Breach at your Fathers do not take it ill  my dear  indeed I had not the least Thoughts of what you suggest and if I omitted any thing which I ought to ha' done in Respect to you  My dear  I ask you Pardon  Offers to Kiss her she turns away from him  Wife  What signifies that when you have used me so you know I must submit to your Orders now they are made  Hus  My dear  Is there any thing in my Family Orders which offends you or that you would not have done if there is let me know and it shall be altered  Wife  No no  it's past the Time to ask that Question now you know it is my Part to submit  Hus  My dear  I cannot but think  it hard  you should talk of submitting where there is nothing imposed I impose nothing and Offer to Alter any Thing you shall direct to be altered  Wife  Is it not imposing when you did it all without so much as speaking a Word to me about it tho' the Matter of it was never so good  yet the Manner of doing it was by imposing a Compliance in me since I was not thought worthy to be spoken to about But you see  I do not Trouble you much with my Company  Hus  That's my Grief  my dear  and principally because I fear that  at last  it will not be your Comfort  Wife  What need that trouble you  Hus  My dear  if you suppose I love you you cannot think I can be less concerned for your future Happiness then for your present  Wife  I suppose none of the three  Hus  If you do me Justice you will be satisfied of them all but  you are Angry now  I'll wave that Discourse till you are better satisfied  Wife  Your Grief  you speak of is not at all at the Occasions given me  Hus  My Grief  is That the Occasion you take of being displeased is from what is my indispensible Duty and yours also  Wife  The doing your Duty is none of my Grief  Hus  My dear  it is  a double Grief to me  to hear you say the Reason of your Dislike is from my Error in the Manner of introducing it  had I for seen it  I would ha' made no Scruple to ha' laid down all my Authority as you call it  as a Master  and ha' begged of you to let it be done  Wife  Don't banter me  you would have asked my Leave to have set up Family Worship would you what if I had refused would you ha' let it alone for that  Hus  That is not a Question to be asked  I am sure you would not have refused  you could not have refused such a natural known Duty and the certainty of your free Consent was a very good Reason why I should omit the Ceremony nay if I had thought of it I question whether I should have asked you I rather should ha' thought I had obliged you  in it and should have offended in making it a Question whether you consented to it or no  Wife  But the more Ingenuous Truth of the two  bad been to ha' said  That if you had asked me and I had refused to consent  yet  that you would ha' done it against my Will and therefore to avoid the Strife you chose not to propose it is  not that the Case now  Hus  My dear  I own it is a Duty that I dare not omit and tho' if I had thought that you had expected it I would have asked your Consent yet I should have asked it upon a Presumption of your being ready to agree to it and it wou'd ha' been the greatest Affront to you in the World to have supposed otherwise of you We ought no more to ask one anothers Leave to pray to GOD than we ought to ask one anothers Consent to Eat or Drink rise up or sit down  Wife  Well  you see as  I told you  I don't disturb you at it  Hus  But if you know how much that does disturb me I believe you would consider of it  Wife  I don't trouble my self about that I assure you  Hus  Well my dear  I remember what I said to you before we were married at your Aunt's House upon this very Subject  when I little thought you were in earnest  but I'll perform it faithfully  Wife  I remember nothing of it  Hus  I told you  if you would not let me pray  with you  I would pray  for you  and so I do heartily  and I hope GOD will hear me at last he has Ways to move your Heart  tho' I cannot prevail  Wife  O your Memory is very good  and that makes me remember something too that was said at the same Time  which I suppose you have forgot  Hus  What's that my Dear  Wife  Why  That I would have my Liberty and would not be tyed to your Formalities but that I would go a visiting when I pleased  tho' it were  when you were at your long Prayers and that I would go to the Play and to the Park a Sundays too  If I pleased  Hus  My dear  have I not given you as much liberty as you have desired have I offered the least Restraint to you I have not so much as used the Entreaties and Perswasions that I capitulated with you to have Liberty for  Wife  But I can see well enough how you like and how ill you are pleased  Hus  Nay  my dear  I never promised you that I would like such Things and be pleas'd with them that's what you cannot say we agreed upon nor I believe have you so little Sense to expect  that I can like it  but hitherto you have not had the least Trouble of a Complaint from me I believe and  heartily pray  that GOD will in his own Time open your Eyes to see that you are in the Wrong and to restore you to me and to your Friends that we may yet have the Comfort of one another and till that Time I bear all you think fit to do with as much Patience as I can  Wife  But still you are going on with your Family Government and now you are for Catechising your Children as if I was not able to tell them  who made them  as well as you  Hus  I never questioned your Ability  my dear  Wife  No  nor my willingness  neither  for you never asked me whether I had done it or would do it or not what was this but exposing me to all the House as if I was not fit to be trusted with teaching a little Child but that you were fain to do it yourself  Hus  Instructing our Children is the natural Work both of Father and Mother and my talking to the Child in that Manner no way implies that you  do not  or  cannot  or that I think so in that your Inference is not just  my dear  Wife  I think it below you  Hus  My dear  how can you think that when you said to me  of your own Father  That if he had done it sooner by you the fatal Breach among you had never happened  Wife  That Case and this is not alike I never refused or omitted it what need you meddle with it  Hus  Well  my dear  so the Children be but early and rightly instructed you and I will never differ about  who shall do it  do but grant me this That it ought to be done  Wife  Yes yes  It ought to be done to be sure  Hus  Then  my dear  If you will allow me so much plainness I'll prove to you that I have not done amiss because it had not been done to this Child and therefore it was my Duty to do it you having thought fit to omit it  Wife  How do you make that out  that I have omitted it  Hus  You shall have unanswerable Evidence immediately for your Conviction Come hither  Harry  Come hither  my dear  He calls the little Boy and Examins him  Fa  Who made you  my dear  Child  God  Fa  Who told you so  Child  You did  Pappa  Fa  When my dear  Child  Just now  Pappa  Fa  Did no Body ever tell you so before  Child  No  Pappa  Mo  Sirrah did not I tell you so  Child  No  Mamma  Mo  Nor Nurse neither  Child  No  Mamma  Mo  You tell a Lye Sirrah  Child  No indeed  Mamma  Hus  Nay  my dear  Children and Fools  you know  c  Wife  I am sure he tells an untruth now  Hus  Why  my dear  do not be angry with the Child for I asked him over and over  who made him  and he said  he could not tell  then I asked him  if no Body ever told him  and he said  no  and if he had not answered me so which a little surpriz'd me and troubled me too I should not have committed this Invasion upon your Office  Wife  Well well  It's time enough to teach him all that he is not three Years old  Fa  My dear  I thank God it is yet early enough but never let thee and I dispute about  whose Work it is to instruct our Children  if we do our Duty and instruct them well it will find us both Work enough as they grow up we shall be glad to help one another and not think it an Encroachment upon our Office  Wife  But it is nonsence to meddle with Children at three Years old they will Answer like Parrots and say what they are bid but they understand nothing of what they say  Hus  With Submission  my dear  that is a mistake an awe and sence of the Greatness and Majesty of GOD and the fear we ought to have of offending him is capable of being received by a Child as soon as it can speak  Wife  I do not see it's to any Manner of Purpose  Hus  My dear  does he know you  Wife  Yes to be sure  Hus  Does he know you have a Rod and that he must not be a naughty Boy and that if he does he will make you Angry and you may correct him  Wife  What's all that to the Purpose  Hus  By the same Rule he is Capable of receiving due Impressions of his Maker  Wife  Not at all  Hus  No doubt as soon as GOD has impowered his Soul to receive any Knowledge at all it is our Duty to help him to receive some Knowledge of GOD besides  my dear  you are not ignorant how soon a little Infant will be Taught to Sin and I think we ought to study to be before Hand with the Devil and lay a Foundation of good in our Children before he can get in to lay a Foundation of Evil  Wife  You are wiser than I  to be sure  and therefore you thought fit to begin  as you suppose  before me but  to be sure  before you enquired of me or consulted with me any thing about it  Hus  You are dispos'd to be angry my dear my Comfort is you have no Reason and that I have done nothing but what I think my Duty and  not even that  with a Design to Displease you  Wife  You Fancy your self very obliging  Hus  I would be always so to you  my dear  Wife  Mighty obliging indeed in letting me go alone always I suppose you are ashamed of your Wife if you had you should not have taken me  I did not Court you  Hus  My dear  I never let you go alone but to places which I cannot agree to go to such as the Playhouse and to my Lady where you know the Company and the Gaming are things I have not been bred to and cannot comply with  Wife  What your Conscience will not let you play a Game at Cards  Husb  My Dear  Suppose it would  as to the simple Action  yet I own it will not as to the Circumstances  Wife  What Circumstances I beseech you  Husb  Why first  I can imploy my Time better  and they that know the Value of Time and the Haste we are all making to Eternity will think themselves obliged to waste as little of their Time as they can and think it their Duty always to employ it in the best Manner they can possibly  Wife  I think Time spent in good Company is not mispent  Husb  My Dear  When you come nearer the End of your Time  you will think  otherwise  Wife  That's more than you are sure of  Husb  For your Sake  my Dear  I hope it will  it will be a sad Day for you if you should not  and for me too if I should live to see it  Wife  Well  That is but one of your Niceties pray what are the rest  Husb  Why  my Dear  it is true I have other Scraples and  my Second is this  I am now a Father and a Master of a Family and have Servants and Children growing up I have Duties upon me now which were not my Duties before and particularly Family Worship dly I am obliged in Duty to set no evil Example either to Children or Servants and on the contrary to let my Conversation be in all Things Exemplar that I may not have either my Servants or Children justifie themselve in any Excesses by my Example  Wife  What's all this to lawful Things such as visiting a Friend seeing a Play or playing a Game at Cards Those Things that you speak of relate to unlawful Excesses only as Drunkenness Lewdness and such Things as those  Husb  Ay  and other Things too and those Circumstances make some Things unlawful to me which are not so in themselves particularly  my Dear  you stay there at Cards till one or two in the Morning if I did so I must neglect my Duty in my Family and cause a Game at Cards to supersede the Worship of GOD would not that Game at Cards be a Sin  Wife  Yes Yes  I told you at Sir  Anthony  's  you must go Home and say your Prayers  Husb  That was not the kindest Thing that ever you said to me in your Life  my Dear  Wife  I shall always use you so when you are so rude to me to leave the Company  Husb  Then I hope you will excuse me from going again  my Dear  Wife  You may stay away if you please  Husb  Indeed my Dear I must  stay away  or offend you by coming away before you for I cannot dispense with my Duty to GOD upon any Account whatsoever I am very sorry you will not take that for a sufficient Excuse  Wife  What need you make Excuses to me  any thing will serve to a Wife you know  Husb  I am very loath to disoblige you  my dear  and therefore I am giving you just Reasons for my Behaviour in every Part that your own Judgment may oblige you to say you have no Cause to take it ill  Wife  Other Husbands do not live so Do you think any Body but me have their Husbands go to the Piayhouse Doors with them and then run away and leave them  Husb  Indeed  my Dear  I cannot comply with you in that Part and told you so before I married you If you will excuse me going to the Door with you I shall take it very kindly but as for  going to the Plays  as I said of Playing at Cards  I can much better imploy my Time  Wife  Yes yes  you can go Home to your Prayers I wonder you don't make your Prayer an Excuse for going to Dinner  Husb  my Dear  I am sorry to hear you make a Jest and Scoff  at praying to GOD  You never heard me make an Excuse for doing any Thing that becomes me to do in my Life I am none of those that make a shew or a boast of my Duty I intreat you upon what do you ground this Banter Did I ever tell you when I carried you to the Playhouse that I must go Home to my Prayers I tell you plainly  and did so before we were married  I go to no Plays but I never said I did not because I must go to my Prayers  Wife  No no but your spending your Time better implies it for can you spend it better than in your Prayers And you say you are always to spend your Time as well as you can  Husb  You talk to me of my Praying  my Dear  as if I were a meer Pharisee and said my Prayers at the Corner of every Street  Wife  You make more ado about them a great deal I think than you need  Husb  I make no boast of them nor do you know  any more of them  than needful Family Worship requires if I offered any such thing as Private Prayer with you I fear you would but make a mock of it  Wife  No no  not I you may Pray all Night and all Day too if you please for you know you are to spend all your Time as well as you can  Husb  My Dear  there are Duties in a Christian Life for every Part of Time without letting them interfere one with another and yet  my dear  when you are at the Play I don't know whether  it might not be as proper a Time for me to Pray as at any Time especially upon your Account  Wife  Why then  I beseech you  more than at another Time  Husb  For the same Reason that  Job  was offering Sacrifice for his Sons and Daughters when they were making merry  viz  That they might not  be led into Temptation  Wife  I desire none of your Prayers  Husb  For that Reason you have the more Occasion for them  my Dear  and I the more Reason to pray for you  Wife  I had rather you would go to the Play with me  Husb  I am sorry for the wretched choice you make  and very sorry  you make it impossible for me to oblige you I had much rather you would put your self in a Condition that I might according to my own Inclination deny you nothing  Wife  You will have your own Way you will be  a worse Husband  before you  are a better  Husb  I believe you will be  a better Wife  before you are  a worse  Wife  You have  too much Religion  to be a kind Husband  Husb  LORD Give you more Religion  my Dear  then you will be  a kinder Wife  Wife  Don't trouble your Head to pray for me  I tell you  till I put up a Bill to you as they do at Church  Husb  I shall always pray for you my Dear  Wife  You'll ha' no Thanks for it your Labour is all lost  Husb  I hope not  my Dear  but I entreat you let us have no more of this kind of Discourse you mix it with so much Prophaneness  as well as Ʋnkindness  that it is very grievous and very afflicting  to me I was in hopes never to have seen you come this length  Wife  What length am I come  Husb  I desire not to enter into particulars I fear you are laying in a great Stock for Repentance and our Discourse does but encrease it therefore I forbear saying any more for in multiplying Words there wanteth not Sin  Wife  I desire to be used better or I shall be a worse Wife  Husb  You are disposed to be out of Temper at this Time  my Dear  I hope you will be of another Mind when you have considered of it I'll leave you a while  Wife  For as long as you please  He withdraws and goes up Stairs  When her Husband was gone and she had sat a while and mused upon what she had done her Passion began to abate and Reason to take Place again in her Soul and first her Unkindness to her Husband began to shew it self to her I believe  says she to her self  I have anger'd him heartily well it can  t be help'd now let him  ev'n take it if he will  But a little further thinking brought her more to her self  and then  her Affection to him stirred in her and she breaks out again But  why should I treat him thus He never was unkind to me in his Life he has been the tenderest Husband that ever Woman had and has taken me with Circumstances ill enough I'll go and heal it all again take him in my Arms and speak kindly to him  Away she goes to speak to him but cannot find him she enquires for him the Servants say he is in his Closet up she flies thither but he was come down again and was gone out then look  ng out at the Window she saw him at a Distance  walking very melancholly in some Fields near the House all alone by him self By this Time she was entirely come to her self and seeing him walk so solitarily made her very uneasie she sends a Servant to him to tell him she desired to speak with him and in hopes of his coming she run out into the Garden to meet him but the Boy brought her Word again he was gone and he could not find him  Now she began violently to reproach her self with her ill Usage of her Husband and shutting her self into her Chamber she reflected bitterly on her self  What a Brute have I been  said she  to the best Husband that ever Woman had That took me without a Farthing Portion when I was turned out of Doors by my Father and Mother that never said an unkind Thing to me in his Life that when I have lost    l at a Time at Play never said so much as why did you do so or grudg'd parting with his Money  What barbarous Language have I given him  And how calmly and tenderly has he returned all along without one unkind Word sure I am the veriest Brute of a Wife that ever any Man had And don't deserve that ever he should have the least Value for me again  She stopt a while and wept vehemently and then went on with her Exclamations upon her self thus  Then  what have I quarrelled with him for  but for what all the Women in the Nation but I would value a Man for  viz  For his being sober and virtuous and religious and did ever a Fool talk to a Husband as I did about his Family Orders his Praying to GOD and the like why my own Conscience tells me that he is in the Right and I am in the wrong and tho' I mind nothing my self I cannot but own he does well sure I am the worst Creature  alive There are many Women and Men too that have Religion little enough but sure never any Woman abused a Husband for being better than themselves before  Here she burst out into Tears again and still impatient upon every little Noise she heard in the House to know if her Husband was come Home  Her Husband had born all her Taunts with the utmost Patience as above and had not withdrawn at last but that he found himself moved by her talking irreligiously and prophanely when fearing he should fly out in a Passion too and so give her any indecent Language  as she did him  and which he thought himself obliged to avoid  he withdrew  He was however not only surprized but extremely afflicted at this Treatment and not only at this as an Accident but at the sad Prospect of what he was to expect from the Continuance of it and that both as it respected the Conduct of her self abroad which began to be publick and also the Treatment he was to have from her at Home  However as the best Remedy for the Disorder of his Passions he went immediately into his Closet and prayed earnestly to GOD for a patient submissive Frame in himself to all his Providences that he might not lay any Stress upon the Instrument but view the Meaning and Design of Soveraign Goodness in all those Things  not forgetting  at the same time to Pray very sincerely for his Wife That GOD would open her Eyes convince her of her Sin and bring her Home to himself by a true Repentance and Reformation  This brought him to a perfect Composure of Mind and after some time spent thus he went out and took a Walk in some Fields behind his House where his Wife afterwards  as is noted above  discover'd him from her Chamber Window but before the Messenger she sent came thither he was gone having walked into the City and as he went he accidentally met with his Wife's Father and going to take a Glass of Wine together the following Discourse happened between them  Fa  Well  Son  I hear you are gone to House keeping I give you Joy of your Settlement how does all your Family  Son  We should do all much better if we had your Blessing Sir and might have some of your Company  Fa  Indeed  Son  you have my Blessing and good Wishes very heartily I have no other Reason  Son  I thank you for it so far Sir but we are without it in a Family Way which is what I long to have over is there no Way Sir to obtain your Pardon  Fa  GOD has not obliged us to Pardon Offences that are never acknowledged  Son  Son  Sir your Daughter and I are  one  now be pleased to accept my Acknowledgment for her I do most freely own she has been in the Wrong in every Part and I'll beg your Pardon for her on my Knees  Fa  If you will say  she desires you to do so  I'll grant it at first Word and abate you the Ceremony of Kneeling  Son  I wish I could say so Sir  honestly  but I dare not say so unless it were true  Fa  I know that very well and therefore I put it upon your bare saying it  Son  It is my great Grief That it is not so much so as I would have it but can you abate nothing  Sir  Fa  Nay Son  I'll leave it to you  is it meet I should come and say  Daughter I am in the Wrong I ought not to have reformed my Family or if I had I ought not to have expected you or your Brother should have complied with it  And  therefore you have been in the Right and I am very sorry it has gone so far pray come and see me  Son  No Sir  I never so much as thought you were in the Wrong  nor do I say  but my Wife ought to come and acknowledge her Fault and ask you Pardon  but she has had ill Advisers  if I had influence enough on her to prevail she should neither eat or sleep till she asked you Pardon in the humblest manner possible  Fa  For your Sake  Son  and to let you see how willing I am to heal a Family Breach  if she will send me Word by you  That she acknowledges she has failed in her Duty and desires me to be reconciled to her I'll come to your House and see her to morrow  Son  It is my Grief Sir  That I cannot promise for her that she should comply with what is so reasonable and so kind I acknowledge  Sir  you cannot ask less  Fa  Nay  I do not expect it  I know she won't do it did she not refuse so much as to see me when she had no Reason but to think she was upon her Deathbed  Son  I am sorry to own to you Sir  That I have not Interest enough in her to prevail for what is so just and so much her Duty  it is my Affliction  I did not think she would have stood out so long  Fa  I do not expect it of you  Son  I know her I wish you could prevail with her upon some  other Accounts she manages her self very strangely  as I hear  Son  I hope Time may shew her the Mistakes she commits they are not of any great Consequence  she will be wiser Sir  with a little more Experience  Fa  But in the mean time she ruins her Reputation and may ruin your Estate for she goes so much abroad she is very seldom at Home and more than that I hear  She Plays  Son  I have no doubt at all of her Virtue tho' she may err in her Prudence  Sir  and that makes me say I hope a little Time will rectify it all as to  Play  she does not Play  high  Fa  Why Son I hear she lost  l  at Sir  Anthony  's a few Nights ago I wonder you will let her go there I forbad her that House when she was a Maid nay her Brother  give him his Due  blamed her for going there he is the Rakishest Fellow in the Town and his Sisters who she used to visit are no better than they should be I would have you for her Sake as well as your own perswade her against it  Son  Alas Sir she is not to be perswaded by me to Things of less Consequence than that  Fa  Then you must restrain her  Son  That is a Task I am no Way qualified for any farther than the Violence of Entreaties and Perswasions will have any Effect  Fa  Why then a Wife may ruin her self and you too I thought you had been fitter to make a Husband than that comes too why it is not ill using a Wife it is Love to her to restrain her from ruining her own Reputation and your Estate do you think I would perswade you to use her ill tho' she has not behaved well to me she is my Daughter and was once my best beloved Daughter  nay I love her very well still and I would not have my Scores paid that way  Son  Truly Sir if that be required of a Husband  I am not fit for a Husband  and as to ruining me  indeed  if my Wife will ruin me  I may be ruined  for I can never frame my Temper to use any Violence or Restraint with her besides her Temper is such She would set all the House in a Flame and expose her self to all the World  Fa  Pray what said she to you for losing  l  at Play I hear you paid it for her  Son  No Sir I would not dishonour her so much I gave it her immediately to pay for her self she said of her own Accord she was in the wrong and she would Play no more I wish she would lose  l  tho' I paid it this very Night so she might but be prevailed with to leave it off  Fa  I hear she behaves very ill to you at Home too  Son  No no Sir  I do not complain of her she would be a very good Wife to me Sir if I could perswade her to leave off keeping Company with two or three Families and I hope in Time she will be tired of them  Fa  I cannot but be glad that I fairly told you all I feared of her  before you had her  you have nothing to blame me for  Son  Sir I blame no Body  she is a very good Wife  Fa  Well  you are kind to her but I blame her extremely and it is a Grief to me that any thing out of my Family should behave so I am sensible how obliging you have carried it to her  and do still  and how tenderly you use her and I wanted an Occasion to tell you that tho' she has not Grace to make you a suitable Return for it  I shall never forget it  nor I hope forget to reward it  Son  Sir you lay too much Stress upon what is nothing but my Duty and what she very well deserves for  give her her Due  when she is not prejudic'd by her Passions which are hasty and which hurry her too violently after the Gayeties of the Town and the Company which she is fond of she is of the most engaging Temper in the World and no Man that has any Sense or Affection can be unkind to her I may have Faults of my Side and I should think it hard she would not bear with them and I see nothing in her but I can bear with and wait patiently for the Return of her Temper  nothing afflicts me so much in her  as to see her so entirely empty of any Thing that is Religious that she will hardly bear with our Family Orders and the common Worship of GOD but as that must be wrought by the immediate Hand of GOD I hope still it will come in his due Time she wants no Sense of Things nor Knowledge of what is our natural Duty either to GOD or one another  Fa  Well Son  you have more Hopes of her than I have  I assure you  I cannot but say if any thing on Earth can bring her to a Sense of her Duty either to GOD or Man it must be such a winning obliging Carriage as she receives from you if that will not work on her she must be the ungratefullest Creature on Earth considering in what Circumstances you took her and that you have had her three Year without having had a Penny with her  Son  Sir as I told her before I married her I would never ask any Thing of you on that Account till I had if possible brought her and you to be reconciled so I have been as good as my Word I am sure she has suffered no Inconveniency on that Account  Fa  But I shall not be so unjust to you as to let you suffer on that Account and therefore  tho' I cannot receive her as a Daughter  yet I shall always value you and treat you as a Son  nay as my own Son  and tho' for her I would not disburse a Shilling yet I have resolved  and have wanted an Opportunity to tell you  That I will give you for your own Sake  not for hers  as much as I would have given her if she had never disobliged me and if you are willing to have it settled on either or both your Children I will do it when you please  Son  It is more Sir than I can ask  and therefore it shall be settled as you shall think fit I hope my Wife will think her self obliged to thank you Sir as well as I  Fa  I do not expect or regard her Thanks while she stands out against her Duty The Submission I have insisted upon is no Ceremony I demand it not in Respect to my self but as a Debt due to the World in Acknowledgment of her Duty to GOD and her Parents and as I had never withheld her Portion but in Expectation That  some Time or other  she would have complied and ha' come to her self so I will make no Advantage of the Delay but you shall have the Interest of it from the Day of her Marriage and  as I say this is done to oblige you  and as an Acknowledgment of your extraordinary Behaviour to my Daughter so you shall not take it ill that I desire her to take Notice I will not now accept of her Submission or be any ways concerned with her or for her upon any Account whatsoever  Son  Sir as the Goodness you are pleased to express to me is more than I have Merit to ballance or Reason to expect so I beg you would not let your Kindness to me be clogg'd with any farther Severity to my Wife for since our Good  or Evil being in this World is inseparable this would be laying a heavy Load on me at the same Time that you are obliging me in the highest Manner possible nay this would be an unspeakable Grief to me since all the Prospect of Happiness I have in this World consists in the Hopes I have of one Day making up this wretched Breach to the Comfort and Satisfaction of us all  Fa  Well however you may deliver this as a Message to your Wife from me only noting for your own private Satisfaction That I do not make this with the same unalterable Resolution as I have the other  Son  Then Sir I entreat you let not me be the Messenger of any Thing to my Wife that I know will grieve her  Fa  If the Absence from her Father had been any Grief to her she would ill ha' born it out so long I cannot suppose it any Grief to her  Son  But Sir I have many Reasons to believe  it is a Grief to her  and many more to hope that it will be much more a Grief to her than it is when GOD shall be pleased to show her both the Sin of what is past and what is her Duty for Time to come which Time I earnestly Pray for and not without Hope and Sir as I shall always make it my Endeavour to convince her how much 'tis her Duty to acknowledge her Offence both to GOD and her Father and humbly to ask Pardon of both I beg you would not put a silencing Argument in her Mouth to answer my Entreaties and Perswasions with by saying to me  don't you know 'tis too late  and  has not my Father said if I do submit my self to him now he will not accept me  If GOD should say so at the same Time Sir she would be undone and the having you say so  on the one Hand  may tempt her to despair of God's  Mercy  on the other  and to make that Conviction which I hope shall be her Mercy  when ever it comes  be her Ruin  The Father embraces him  Fa  Dear Son  you are fitter to be a Father than I am I am fully answered by your Arguments nothing can be more engaging than the Affection you discover  for a Wife  That I doubt never deserved it from you and  I believe never will  I will forbear the Message say to her then what ever you will and what ever GOD shall direct you in order to bring her to her Duty you give me some Hopes that GOD will yet be merciful to her in that he has fixed such a Concern for her Good in one so capable of being a prevailing Instrument with her I pray GOD bless your Counsel to her Good  They part and the Young Gentleman goes Home to his Wife  His Wife had impatiently waited for his Return her Passion was entirely over and her Affection to her Husband acting now as violently the other Way She had afflicted her self exceedingly at his not coming Home In so much That her Grief put her very much out of Order and she had thrown her self down upon a Couch in her Chamber but had ordered her Servants not to fail to call her as soon as their Master came in  As soon as he came in  which was later than his usual Time  and upon enquiring for his Wife was told by the Servants that she was very ill he ran directly up Stairs into her Chamber before any Body could give her Notice of his being come  but the  who listened too attentively to want a Messenger heard him coming up Stairs and rasing hastily off the Couch she ran to the top of the  Stairs to him and taking him violently in her Arms  My Dear  Says She  Forgive me  That  I have ungratefully insulted and basely provoked the tenderest Husband and the best Temper in the World  Tears choked her Words and she could say no more and having risen up and run cross the Room too hastily the Violence of that Motion and of her own Passions overcame her and she fainted  He called out for Help and the Servants immediately running in she was carried back to her Chamber and in some short time she came to her self again but finding her Husband sitting by her and very anxious for her it renewed her Grief and made her for some Time unable to express her self freely  When she was entirely recovered and fit to converse  she ordered the Servants to withdraw  and then with Abundance of Tears she acknowledged  to him  how sensible she was That she had used him ill and that she had not behaved her self as became her in any of her Carriage to him how afflicted she had been at his Absence so long believing that she had exasperated him and grieved him and in short assured him she would endeavour to make him amends by a quite different Behaviour to him all her Life after  The Grief he had conceived at her swooning away and the Surprize of it together with the Extreme of Joy he felt within himself at her declaring her Resolutions of altering her Conduct caused him to speak little to her except what he thought proper to Comfort her till she pressed him by often repeating such Questions as these  My Dear do you forgive me  Are you not  Angry  Were you not  very Angry  and the  like which made him after some Pause answer thus  Husb  My Dear  I am not angry nay I was not angry I never knew what it was to be angry with you but I cannot say  I was not grieved  and heartily afflicted but you have abundantly made me amends and  much more  than I ever desired of you for I can allow of no Submissions and Subjections between  you  and  I but those of Love  but you will add to my Satisfaction more than you are aware of  or than I can express  if you will give me Leave to ask you  one Question  Wife  What is that  my Dear  I'll answer you any Question you can ask  as well as I can  Husb  How long  my Dear  after I left you was it before your Affections prevailed over your Passion to work this Blessed Change upon your Mind  Wife  My Dear  You were not gone a quarter of an Hour before my Heart struck me That I had been unkind to you and I acknowledge that you had not deserved it at my Hands  Husb  My Dear  I am satisfied fully satisfied The Work is of GOD to him shall be the Glory and I will take it for a Blessed Token that it shall not end here  for his Works are all perfect  The Wife had no Guess at what he meant by this and therefore made no Reply but his Joy at her Answer proceeded from this That he knew the Change was wrought in her that very Time nay as near as he could guess the very Moments that he  as is noted before  was earnestly Praying to GOD not only to give him Patience to bear the Affliction but in his own Time to open her Eyes to her Duty convince her of her Sin and bring her to a sincere Repentance  vide Page  and this was an unspeakable Comfort to him  This affected him so much That as soon as he could possibly leave his Wife he retired to his Closet and with great Thankfulness and Joy gave Praises to the Divine Goodness for this Beginning of Mercy not forgetting earnestly to Pray That GOD would be pleased to carry on this Work to a thorow awakening the Conscience of his Wife and bringing her to a Sense of her Duty to GOD and to sincere Repentance for her former Errors in which how he was heard and how effectually he was answered will appear in the following Part of this Work  The Father of this Young Lady having as is said above been discoursing with her Husband some time when they parted he went Home where he found a Letter directed to his Daughter and which had come inclosed in one to him from his Son who had gone abroad into the Army as is noted already This Letter he immediately sent away by a Servant to his Daughter and it was brought to her just at that Time when her Husband was withdrawn as above so that when he came back he found his Wife all in Tears again he hegan to comfort her  thinking it was the Effect of the same Thing which had affected her before  but she undeceived him by shewing him the Letter from her Brother which was to this Purpose  Dear Sister  While I had a Hand to write to you I too seldom paid youthe Respect which my Affection and Duty to you required and now I have neither a Hand to write or a Heart to dictate my last gave you an Account of my being wounded at the Siege of  Doway  of which after some Time I was cured tho' I lay all the Winter Sick at  Lisle  now I am the miserablest  Object in the World I was taken Prisoner of War last Week and am brought to this Place having my Right Arm broken by a Musquet Ball and to morrow it must be cut off  GOD is just Sister  I cut off my Father's Right Arm as to his Family when I broke from him by Violence and went abroad against his Consent now I lose my Right Arm as a just Retaliation I insulted my Father upon my having an Estate without him now I must come a begging to my Father for Bread or perish in Misery for my Estate is gone and I am out of Commission  GOD is just Sister  He is  very just  I hope you have begged my Father's Pardon and obtained his Blessing tho' I may never live to do it I have wrote to my Father for some Assistance but have little Reason to expect it  Adieu  Your dying Brother  Cambray    The Grief of this surprising Letter and the Concern she had been in before upon her Breach with her Husband put her into such an Agony That she spoke not a Word but incessantly grieved and wept nor could the tenderest most Affectionate Expressions of her Husband who never stirred from her procure a Word from her all that Evening she went to Bed indeed but got no Sleep that Night and by the next Morning it had thrown her into a high Fever which brought her to Death's Door  as we call it  and as it pleased GOD That during the Violence of her Distemper she retained the perfect Use of her Senses so the Sense of her Danger awakened her to a Sense of her Duty as will appear in the next Dialogue  The End of the Third Dialogue  The Fourth DIALOGUE  THE Last Dialogue gave an Account of the Accident which had thrown the Young Married Lady into a dangerous Fever and left her in a very weak Condition her Husband as he was a tender affectionate Relation and was in the utmost Concern and Affliction for her seeing a great deal of Danger of her Life so as he was also a serious Christian he could not be without inexpressible Anxieties for her future State He had been backward to speak to her of Death or of any of the Perplexities which were upon him for her Condition least the Impression should be assistant to the Disease yet he thought it was his indispensible Duty not to be wanting to make her sensible of her Danger as to her Soul's Condition and especially as to the Breach with her Father which he always acknowledged was unjustifiable and a great Sin in her both against God and her Father  While he was sitting mournfully by her and his Heart opprest with the Struggle he had between his Duty to tell her his Thoughts and his Fear of injuring her Health by it she put an End to his Trouble of that kind by beginning with him  thus  Wife  My Dear  you see I am dying but I cannot go out of the World without repeating my Acknowledgment to you that I have not carried it to you as became me or done either the Duty of a Wife or a Christian as to you in particular especially your Kindness to me considered and therefore I repeat my asking you Pardon  Forgive me my Dear and let me be assured you do it freely for this is not a Time to compliment me  Husb  My Dear  I have been backward to speak because I would not oppress and discourage thee but I cannot deny that I fear thy Danger is great as for what troubles thy Mind about any Carriage to me be as easy as if we were not yet come together I have not the least Regret or Resentment in my Heart about it it is all to me as if it had never been done  Wife  Then say  you forgive me  you must say so say  you forgive me my Dear  Husb  If I did not say so plainly before it was because I would not call it an Offence but since you will have me to call it so  I do forgive  all that can be thought an Offence against me with all the Freedom and Joy I am capable of  The LORD forgive all our Offences against him  Wife  Then  my Dear  I am satisfied and thankful and if God spare me farther Life I'll make thee full amends if it be in my Power if not  my Request is  Let it answer all the Reproaches that shall be cast upon me after I am gone by telling the whole World that I acknowledged it and ask'd you Pardon  Husb  My Dear  Let it take up none of your Thoughts Matters of greater Moment are before thee if thy Life is in Danger  as I fear  I beg of thee  my Dear  look up to him that gives Life and to whom  are the Issues of Life and of Death  Wife  I have a sad Prospect within a guilty Soul and a hardned Heart  Husb  But  there is Forgiveness with him that he may be feared  and he will  take away the Heart of Stone and give a Heart of Flesh  Wife  But it is very late to ask it now  very late  A Sick Bed is an ill Time to repent in when the Body is burdened with the Force of a Disease the Soul opprest with a fearful View of Eternity and the Senses seldom free to act their Part  Husb  My Dear  but tho' it be  very late  it is never  too late  powerful Grace is not restrained to Time or limited by Circumstances one relenting Thought sincerely cast up to Heaven one hearty Wish one returning Sigh can reach Heaven be not afraid to cast thy Soul at his Feet whose  Nature and Property is ever to have Mercy and to forgive  Wife  I cannot say  That it is not too late  Husb  Remember then the Words of our blessed Saviour himself  be not afraid only believe My Dear  shall I desire the Minister to make thee a Visit and to pray with thee it may be GOD may direct him to speak something to thy Comfort  Wife  No my Dear  Those Prayers of thine which I have wickedly and unkindly made my Jest shall be now my only Comfort And as  GOD is just  in bringing me to want thy Prayers which I too much slighted so  He is good  and may be pleased to do me good by the Means that I so wickedly contemned that others may know the Duty of so dear a Relation as Husband and Wife and I may  if I should live  know how to value them for the future  Will you pray with me my Dear  Husb  As well as Grief will permit me  my Dear  I will with all my Heart  Upon her earnest Request her Husband prayed with her and She seemed so affected with  the Confession of Sin  which he made to be as it were the Introductory Part of his Prayer that from that Time forward he entertained great Hopes of her being a true Penitent  He avoided being long in Respect of her Weakness but as he was never from her either Night or Day she caused him to Pray with her almost every two Hours and sometimes would break out in short Ejaculatory Prayers for her self in which he could perceive mingled with deep Humiliation and Confession plain Appearances of her having more Hope of her future State than before  Her Husband encouraged by this in one of his Prayers making Confession of Sin mentioned something of the Errors and Mistakes of Youth which we are hurried into by the Violence of our Passions and the violent Affection with which we entertain our Pleasures and Vanities and then went on to a Confession of the Sin of rejecting the Council of our Instructors and refusing to stoop to the just Reproofs of those who we are committed to by the Consequence of our Relation or by our Dependance upon them and who it is our Duty to submit to thus proceeding to point out  tho' gently  the Sin she had been guilty of in resisting the Admonitions of her Parents imploring GOD's Pardon for it and that her Eyes might be opened to see and acknowledge it  As soon as this Prayer was over she turned her self towards him  and reaching out her Hands to him  she embrac'd him with great Passion and Earnestness as her Strength would permit  my Dear  said she I bless GOD for what he has  put into thy Heart to say upon that Subject I am convinc'd I have sinned greatly in that matter of my Father  I am convinc'd I am convinc'd  repeating the Words several Times with very great Earnestness and Abundance of Tears  Her Husband told her he was very glad to hear her say so much That it had layn much upon his Mind to mention it to her  but that he was loath to grieve her  but he hoped that as GOD had been pleased to make her sensible of the Evil of it so he would  as of old in the Case of the great Penitent David  no sooner give her a Resolution to confess the Sin but add the Comfort of his Pardon  I said I will confess my Transgression unto the LORD and thou forgavest the Iniquity of my Sin  She look'd up with a kind of a Smile at these Words and said GOD will for give me  my dear  tho' my Father won't at which her Husband said  my Dear  if GOD forgive us it is not so much to us if others do not but I dare say if thy  Father  heard thee he would not wait for any farther Acknowledgment shall I let him know it said her Husband I know his Heart mourns for thee  My Dear  said she I am in an ill Condition to ask him Forgiveness now but  if he was here  I would do it as well as I could with all my Heart and here her Tears again interrupting her she said no more  Her Husband found it was not proper to say much more to her at that Time her Distemper being violent so he withdrew secretly pleased to hear her speak with so much Earnestness and Concern about her Father and immediately sent a Servant to her Father with a Letter to tell him he desired to see him in the Morning and withal wrote some Account of the Occasion the  Father tho' he took the News of her Illness very heavily for he still loved her very tenderly yet received this Part of the Account with great Satisfaction and came early in the Morning to the House where his SoninLaw gave him an Account of all the Particulars of his Wise's Discourse  But it was too late for her Fever had encreased upon her with so much Violence in the Night That when her Father came into the Room She was Speechless and to all outward Appearance at the very Point of Death  Her Husband tho' passionately afflicted at so sad a Sight yet willing to give her all the Consolation he could spoke close to her Ear That her Father was come but she did not seem to take any Notice of it her repeated it adding he was come to give her his Blessing and assure her that he had forgiven all the Breach between them at which Words she opened her Eyes and look'd at her Father but closed them immediately and remained speechless  my Dear  said her Husband  give us a Sign if you understand us would you have your Father forgive you  At which she lifted up her Hand  and pray for thee  said her Husband At which she lifted up her Hand again and just opened her Eyes  but could not speak  This was a melancholly Sight for two such near Relations to bear nor did it afford any thing more that serves to our present Purpose The Father prayed by her Bed side and gave GOD Thanks for any Appearances of Mercy to her Soul and committing her into the Hands of her Redeemer they retired expecting her departing every Moment  But Providence had otherwise determined it for tho' she lay in that Condition two or three Days yet it pleased GOD  after that  the Fever  seemed to abate and she came to her Speech again and in a few Days more grew better tho' so very weak as made her Recovery be very slow  Now a new Care and Anxiety seized upon her Husband who tho' truly joyful at the Hopes he had of his Wife's Recovery which a few Days before there was no Room to expect Yet he could not but be fearful least her Convictions should wear off with a Sense of her Danger  as is usual in the Case of Deathbed Repentance  and that  the near Prospect of Death now disappearing  her Love of Vanity and Pleasure should return with her Health and therefore  like one that truly loved her Soul's Advantage as well as her Personal Welfare  he began early to put her in mind of the Debt she owed to the Goodness of GOD which seemed to be giving her a new Life and to whom the Hours he should now bestow ought to be dedicated as given for that Purpose his often repeating these Things gave Occasion to the following Discourse which tho' it suffered several Intermissions from her Weakness yet it being all to the same Purpose will be very well read as one continued Dialogue She began with her Husband upon the Occasion  as I have noted  of his often repeating his Cautions against forgetting after her recovering the Sense of her State which she had upon her Mind when she was in Expectation of Death  Wife  My Dear  says she I see what you are afraid of you fear I shall forget GOD's Goodness to me as soon as I am recovered  Husb  I hope  my Dear  you cannot forget neither what you  are  or what you  were  Wife  But I see plainly you are anxious about it  Husb  My Dear  do not take it ill we  are not Ignorant of Satan's Devices  Our  Adversary the Devil like a roaring Lyon goes about seeking whom he may devour  We are all too Subject to forget the Vows of our afflicted Condition I am no otherwise afraid for thee than as we are all apt to do so  Wife  But has he not  snatched me as a Brand out of the Fire Zech    Husb  It is very true  my Dear  Wife  Has he not  ransomed me from the Power of the Grave Hos    Husb  He has I hope ransomed thy Soul too  Wife  Has not  my Soul been precious in his Sight Sam    Husb  May God keep the Remembrance of it always upon thy Mind  my Dear  Wife  I am assured he will do so  She breaks out in an Extasy of Thankfulness and repeats the d d th Verses of the Psalm  Bless the Lord O my Soul and forget not all his Benefits Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities Who healeth all thy Diseases Who redeemeth thy Life from Destruction Who crowneth thee with loving Kindnesses and tender Mercies  Husb  Let me join  my Dear  said her Husband Psalm  O thou my God save thy Servant that trusteth in thee be merciful unto me O Lord for I cry unto thee daily for thou O Lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in Mercy to them that call upon thee  Wife  Psalm  LORD I have called daily upon thee I have stretched out my Hands unto thee Wilt thou shew Wonders to the Dead Shall the Dead arise and praise thee  Husb  My Dear  I will be an Eccho to all thy Breathings of this Kind Psalm  It is a  good Thing to give Thanks unto the Lord and to sing Praises to thy Name O most High to shew forth thy Loving Kindness in the Morning and thy Faithfulness every Night  Wife  Psalm  I said O my GOD take me not away in the midst of my Days My Days are like a Shadow that declineth and I am withered like Grass  Psalm  I love the LORD because he hath heard my Voice and my Supplication because he hath inclined his Ear unto me Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live  Husb  The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that are bowed down he will fulfill the Desire of them that fear him He also will hear their Cry and will save them The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him To all them that call upon him in Truth  They continued thus in this blessed Extasy of praising and giving Thanks to God for some time every Day and when ever he came into the Chamber to see her he came always with some comforting Text of Scripture in his Mouth which he had found out while he had been absent and this Way of Conversation between them lasted till she was thorowly well when being come down Stairs and beginning to take upon her again the Affairs of her Family after having been at Church to render more solemnly her Thanks to God in Publick for her Recovery She called her Husband to her and began this short Discourse with him  Wife  My Dear  Now God has been pleased to give me a new Life and restore me to thee and to my Family It is my Part to testify my Thankfulness to his Goodness by a new Way of Living and therefore I wish you would begin with a solemn giving Thanks in the Family at your usual Time of Family Worship  Husb  With all my Heart  my Dear  Wife  You shall see  my Dear  I shall no more discountenance the Service and Worship of GOD in my Family as I formerly did to my Shame be it spoken  Husb  Do not mention that any more  my Dear  I hope 'tis forgotten above  He remembreth our Sins no more  and it is meet it should be forgotten with me  Wife  But I shall never forget to mention it with Shame and Reproaches upon my self as long as I live and therefore it is that I desire to be now the first to promote and forward that blessed Work which I was so much the Hindrance of before  Husb  I rejoice  my Dear  at the Encouragement you will give to our doing the Duty of our Station but the bare Performance of a Course of Worship is the meanest Part of what is required Our whole Lives must be squared according to those Rules which GOD has set us to walk by that we may adorn the Profession we make of Religion and  walk in the Commandments and Ordinances of God blameless  Luke  Wife  My Dear  I am not supposing that the Form of our Duty is the Substance of it but as  it is true  that there may be the outward Performance without the Heart  it is as true  that where the Heart is engaged there will be no Omission of the outward Performance and therefore I first thought my self obliged to give you this Assurance of my Willingness to comply with the outward Performance and the rather because of what is past  Husb  My Dear  Let us have no more Reflections on what is past between us the Remembrance of it is with great Satisfaction buried with me  Wife  But  my Dear  you must allow me to look back with Regret and keep it always in my View I shall endeavour to remember you of it no otherwise than by shewing you the Reverse of it in my future Behaviour  Husb  That shall be a Remembrance That will issue only in Praises and Thankfulness to GOD's infinite Goodness and in an Increase  if that be possible  of my Affection to and delight in thee while I live  Wife  First then  my Dear  be satisfied and assured I have intirely done with the Follies of my former Life and that I shall throw away no more Time at the  Playhouse  or in Gaming those Thieves of the Affections and prodigal Waster of Time which Time I have learn'd to know the Value of at the Appearance of Eternity and hope I have now been furnish'd with Knowledge from Experience how to employ it to better Advantage  He embraces her with Tears of Joy running down his Cheeks  Husb  God of his infinite Mercy support those Resolutions  Wife  My Dear  why do you shew a Concer  at it Why those Tears  Husb  They are Tears of Joy  my Dear  Tear  proceeding from a Satisfaction otherwise inex+pressible  Wife  Are they not mingled with some doub  and proceeding from some Fear that I shall brea  in again upon these Resolutions as I have often times done before and as many People do afte  their Deathbed Astonishments are over  Husb  No  my Dear  I hope GOD in who  Strength you have made these Vows will giv  you Grace and Strength to keep them  Wife  My Dear  these Thoughts of mine are not digested into formal Vows and Protestations Things  which often being made in our own Strength  we are justly forsaken by the Divine Assistance in and are left to break and fall from relapsing with greater Violence into the very Sins we in that manner abjure But I find my Heart so fully convinc'd of the Folly and Vanity of those Diversions the unsatisfying uninstructing Pleasure of them the Expence of those unvaluable Moments in them which at Death we would give Millions to retrieve and the many other attending Snares they are inseparable from that I look on them with the utmost Detestation and reproach my self with the greatest Admiration at the Influence which those Things had upon me  Husb  My Dear  this is a greater Assurance to me of the Stability of thy Resolutions than a thousand formal Oaths and Vows against them which as you well observe  being often made in our own Strength  God is pleased  for our Mortification  to leave us to break and which also the Devil never gives over solliciting us to forget and undervalue  Wife  Well  my Dear  I hope I shall never alter my Sentiments of these Things and you may I hope depend upon it That neither the Practice it self or the Company that used to make those Things delightful to me will ever be tolerable to me again  Husb  My Dear  you must be civil to your Acquaintance  Wife  Truly it will be with Difficulty that I shall be so  to some of them  and I shall miss no Occasion of wearing out the Acquaintance with them especially that of  Sir Anthony  and my Lady  Light head  Husb  I believe  my Dear  their Company can be little Diversion to you I cannot think they ever really were they have so little in them I think it was impossible  Wife  They have been Engines in the Hand of the Devil to do me Mischief and to make me run  a dreadful Length  in my own Ruin both Soul and Body  Husb  It must be by meer Drollery and Mimick then for they have neither of them any such thing as solid Wit or agreeable Behaviour  Wife  It has been by that bewitching Thing called Gallantry and Honour by which  my Lady especially  as it were bantered me out of a Sense of all kind of Duty either to God or Man made me think it below me to regard Relative Obligations and ungenteel to be bound by the Duties either of a Child to my Father or of a Wife to my Husband  Husb  She has done thee no Harm in the main I hope  Wife  She has employed me  my Dear  these five Year in diligently laying up a vast Stock for Repentance and making Work for Tears and Re+proaches as long as I live  Husb  Those Things often end worse  my Dear  I fear they will end worse with them  Wife  If the End is any Thing with me but Rui  of Soul and Body it must be the Effect of infinit  Mercy and the free Grace of God  Husb  And is not that a blessed Fruit  Wife  But in the mean Time it is a Fountain o  secret Regret Self Abhorrence constant Re+proaches and Sighs that break the very Sou  This is  the Fruit  I have  of those Things whereof  am now ashamed  Husb  A Blessed Fruit it is however in the End  viz The peaceable Fruit of Righteousness to the saving of the Soul  Wife  But what Mortification What Regret What Havock has it made in my Soul Here I have been an undutiful Child A Terror to my Relations A Grief to my Father and Mother The Ruin of my Brother  Tears stopt her Speech for a while at the Mention of her Brother  Husb  Do not mention that now  my Dear  Wife  Not mention it Yes I must mention it He is undone And I was Partner with him in his Sin Nay I was worse than he Why has GOD ruined him and spared me I was a Rebel to my Father I have been a Traytor to thee  my Dear  and above all a Forsaker of God and a Despiser of Religion and all that was good and why am not I destroyed rather than my Dear Brother  Husb  But God that gives Repentance gives also Pardon And blessed be God thou art now rejoicing in Hope  Wife  Ay  my Dear  But what Work is here for Repentance not towards God only but to every one else I have ask'd Forgiveness of thee  my dear  and I ought to do it to my Brother and of my Father and they ought all to refuse me  Husb  But I am sure we are all too glad of the Occasion to entertain such a Thought where God is pleased to pardon  Who is Man  That he should resent I dare say thy Father  forgives thee freely  Wife  Well  whether he will or no it is my Duty to acknowledge my Fault to him  Husb  My Dear  thou hast done it already and he is satisfied he will be here to visit us to Night  Wife  But that is not sufficient to me  Husb  Here thy Father comes already  Her Father knocks at the Door and comes in She runs to him falls on her Knees  and cried  my dear Father  but fainted again  and could not speak a Word more and continued so ill afterward that she was obliged to be carried to Bed  which put the Family into a great Disorder fearing the Return of her Distemper After she had lain some Time and was a little refreshed she desired her Father and Husband to come up into her Chamber While she lay indisposed on her Bed her Husband had related to her Father all the Discourse that had passed between them which so affected her Father that he could not bear giving her the Uneasiness of farther Confessions and therefore when she sent for them up the Father spoke to her Husband thus  "Son I desire you will go up first and tell her  Word for Word  what I say to you as near as you can remember  "First tell her you have related to me the Discourse that was between her and you and that I am fully satisfied with and rejoice in the Acknowledgment she has made of her former Carriage to me and of her Design to acknowledge it farther That I already think it more than enough that as neither her Weakness  on the one Hand  can bear it so neither can my Affection to her on the other Hand bear any  more Submissions And therefore I will not come up to her unless she will promise you not to speak one Word to me of it more but only hear what I shall say to her and so put an intire End to it  Her Husband did so and with much Difficulty prevailed with her to promise upon which her Father being brought in went to her  and kist her  as she lay and praying earnestly in few words to God to bless her and continue his Goodness to her he comforted her in the following manner  "  My dear Child  said he I have Acknowledgments enough and am fully satisfied my Joy and Comfort is That God has given you a due and deep Sense of your Offences  against him  and I hope has pardoned you also your Offence against me is nothing but  as it was  a Sin against him nor had I ever any other Resentment of it but what my common Affection could have prevailed over I rejoice that God has given you Repentance and I think it as much my Duty to forgive you now as I thought before I was obliged  not to do it  till you had acknowledged it therefore I freely and heartily forgive you as if you had never offended me and I make but this one Condition of my Forgiveness which I oblige you to comply with  viz  That you say not one Word more by Way of asking Pardon for as you cannot bear to do it so neither can I to hear it  She kept her Word as to speaking but Abundance of Tears testified how sensible she was of what her Father had said to her and thus an intire Reconciliation was made of all that was past And she proved ever after a sober religious and shining Christian a dutiful affectionate Daughter  to her Parents A tender and obliging Wife to her Husband and a careful instructing Mother to her Children  The Tragical Part of this Story remains and will make the Conclusion of this Work The Subject is the miserable wretched Case of the Young Gentleman the Brother to this Lady and who had gone abroad as has been said but was partly by his Wounds Sickness and Misfortune but principally by his Vices and Extravagance reduced to the last Extremity of Misery had wasted his Estate sold his Commission lost one of his Arms and was brought to the Necessity of writing to his Father for Subsistance and for Money to bring him over to  England  of which the Particulars will appear in the next Dialogue  The End of the Fourth Dialogue  The Fifth DIALOGUE  IN the Last Dialogue you have some Account of the Condition the Young Gentleman formerly mentioned was reduced to in a Letter to his Sister dated from  Cambray  where he was under Cure of his Wounds  It seems his Extravagance had reduced him to the last Extremity and having had his Arm cut off and falling into a long Fit of Sickness after it tho' he was exchanged by Virtue of the Cartel for Exchange of Prisoners and so had his Freedom yet he could not be removed and was at last obliged to sell his Commission after which seeing himself reduced to great Extremities and the utmost Misery even of wanting Bread being in his View he wrote a second Letter to his Father which being brought by a Person who gave a particular Account of his Condition moved his Father to take Compassion of him and relieve him  His Letter to his Father was thus  SIR  As I have little Reason to expect any Relief from you so Duty ought to have moved me not to have  given you the Affliction of knowing my Condition perhaps however while you may be moved with my Disasters it may be some Satisfaction to you to see That he who went away without your Blessing is brought to the necessity of seeking to you for his Bread if it be your Pleasure That I shall perish here in Misery and Friendless I am ready to submit to the Sentence from your Mouth as a just Punishment but if you have so much Concern for my Life as to cause me to be brought over that I may die in my Native Country the Bearer will acquaint you how such undeserved Bounty will be received by  c  The tender compassionate Father tho' he resented his Son's Treatment of him deeply enough and steadily adhered to the Resolution of never receiving him into his Family unless he acknowledged his first Crime  viz  of withstanding the Reformation of his Father's House yet being by no means obliged by that Resolution not to relieve him in Distress or to let him starve in a strange Country having enquired into the Particulars of his Circumstances from the Gentleman who brought the Letter and understanding by him that his Son was reduced to the utmost Distress he immediately remitted Money over to a Dutch Merchant at  Lisle  with Orders to give him present Subsistance and to bring him from  Cambray  thither in Order to his being sent over to  England  all which the said Merchant effectually performed and the poor reduced Gentleman arrived at  London  soon after  It was the very same Day of his Arrival when he caused his Father to have Notice that he was coming to lay himself at his Door but the Father tho' he had relieved him and designed to take  Care that he should not want yet judging it needful to let him know that his Resentments had been very just and that he was to be satisfied further with Relation to Things past before he could be restored to the State of an Eldest Son if ever that was to be done at all gave him the Mortification of fignifying to him by a Messenger That he was not to be admitted to see his Father or to come into his House yet but that he was to go to such a Place not far off where a Lodging was provided for him  This afflicted him extremely at first it threw him into a violent Passion expostulating with the Messenger in such Words as these What Has my Father brought me thus far but to trample on my Misery and to make his Resentment sink the deeper or has he brought me like a Criminal to the Place of Execution thus  as he may think it  to do Justice upon me Why had he not suffered me to perish where I was rather than come hither to die with the more Affliction and Reproach The Messenger told him his Business was not to dispute with him but to deliver his Message That he had no further Instructions And so giving the Coach Man Directions where to go he told the poor Gentleman he would go before to receive him and took his Leave  The unhappy Gentleman bid the Coach Man go on and in a little Time he found himself passing by his Father's Door this struck him with an inexpressible Grief even into an Agony of Shame Anger and Despair when in that very Moment his Dream came to his Mind which he had related to his Sister and which we have set down in the first Dialogue  of this Part viz How that having his Arm shot off and being relieved by his Father abroad and brought over tho' he came  to his Father's Door yet he would not take him in but had ordered him to a Neighbour's House  c  "As soon as this revolved upon his Thoughts it immediately quieted him and he broke out into this Expression  Well  Now I see that nothing befalls us without the determinate Will of that Soveraign Power that guides and governs the whole World This was so long ago represented to me in a Dream how exactly is every Step of it come to pass upon me God is just and it is my Part to submit  This quieted his Mind for some Time and he went on to the House which his Father had appointed him where he found the Servant who  as he had said  went before who helped him in for he was so weak he could hardly go and coming into a Chamber provided for him  fetching a deep Sigh  he threw himself on the Bed without speaking a Word and in this Condition he remained all that Night and Part of the next Day no body coming to him but the People of the House who were however directed to attend him and supply him with Necessaries  In the Evening he heard a Coach stop at the Door and soon after a Lady coming up Stairs who was brought into his Chamber and who he presently knew to be his Sister she found him very weak sitting in a Chair by the Fire leaning his Head upon his Hand and his Elbow on a Table that stood by him his Eyes fixed on the Ground his Countenance to the last Degree dejected pale and thin and in short as like a Spectre as any Thing that was real Flesh and Blood could be supposed to be As she came forward into the Room he lifted up his Eyes and said only this Word  Sister  and would have risen up but had not Strength She designed to have embraced him but  when she saw him she was frighted and amazed and sat down over against him at some Distance being ready to swoon away At first she could hardly be convinc'd it was really her Brother and when she was satisfied of that the very seeing him in that Condition struck her with such Grief That she could not speak a Word to him for a great while Being recovered a little  My Dear Brother  Said she and would have gone on but she burst out into Tears however these Transports which the Surpirze of seeing him in such a Condition might very well be supposed to work in so near a Relation being a little over they began to discourse a little together and after the usual Questions concerning his Health and the proper Remedies to be used to recover his Strength  and the like  the following Dialogue contains the Substance of their Discourse  Sister  Dear Brother  But what makes you so dejected And why have you lost your Courage so much at your Disasters I hope with taking Care of your self and proper Remedies being used you may recover But if your Spirits are sunk you will fall under the Weight of your own Melancholly and be lost without Remedy  Bro  Dear Sister  Not all my Disasters not the Loss of my Arm or the cruel Operations of the Surgeons not the having wasted my Estate not my being reduced to want Bread not all that has befallen me or that could befal me in the World has ever been able to sink my Spirits and cast me so low as this Part of my Tragedy  Sister  What Part Brother  Bro  Why that  my Father  who kindly relieved me when I wrote to him of my Distress who ordered me to be brought Home  as I thought  that according to my Request I might die in my Native  Country should instead of that common Compassion which Nature dictates for Men in Misery bring me hither  but just as they do Malefactors  to die with the more Shame and not suffering me to come within his Doors should send me hither  as it were  to an Hospital to be kept upon his Charity like one who altho' he would not have starved he had relieved not in Favour but that he might die with the most exquisite Tortures of the Mind This he could not but know such a Thing would produce and must produce in a Soul that had any Sense of Misery left  Sister  You lay it too much to Heart Brother  That is not my Father's Design  Bro  Yes yes  That is the Design Why else had he not ordered me to some Hospital or Place of Retreat Some Place where I need not ha' been a Spectacle to and the Reproach of his Servants and the Contempt of all my Acquaintance But he shall have his full Satisfaction over me and I will  as I dream'd I had done  cause my self to be carried to his Gate That he may say he had the Pleasure to see his Eldest Son die at his Door  Sister  Your Grief permits you not to make a right Judgment of Things I beg you will weigh the Circumstances of every Part and you will find  my Father  has quite other Designs towards you  Bro  It cannot be Sister For why this Triumph then over my Disasters It is impossible  Sister  You cannot think so hardly of my  Father  You should rather conclude that his bringing you so near him is in order to restoring you entirely and a little Patience would give you Light in that Matter  Bro  Has he so much as given me the least Intimation of it On the contrary has he not brought me to pass by his very Door and sent  his Messengers to command me to come no nearer to him nor himself so much as vouchsafe to see me  Sister  You should consider  Brother  the Terms on which you stand with my Father with Respect to your going away and the Obligation he is under of expecting some Terms before you are restored  Bro  I know what you mean  Sister  I could have made any Submissions had he not brought me thus  as it were upon a Stage  to be a Spectacle to all People And make a private Breach become publick by a scandalous Pennance Now I can never do it tho' I were much more convinced of the Crime than I am It is impossible No I cannot do it If I starve here  Sister  Dear Brother  do not talk of that you shall not starve I have had too much Hand in your Miseries to suffer you to starve tho' my Father would but you will not find  my Faiher  inclines to any thing unkind But  Dear Brother  you are I hope too sensible of the Mistake we both committed to be unwilling to give  my Father  that small Satisfaction he requires which is but a bare Acknowledgment of having done amiss I have done it with the greatest Sincerity and with the greatest Peace and Satisfaction to my self in the World  to tell you true  I had really no true Peace or Satisfaction till I did do it  Bro  Well Sister  before I speak of that let me observe to you That your Words put me in mind of my old Dream again which you cannot but remember I told you of at my Aunts and it is fulfilled in every Part For I am brought to my Father's very Door and being refused Leave to come in am sent hither to be kept as in an Hospital under Cure and you only just as I dream't  are come to visit me acknowledging you having submitted to my Father and perswading me to do the same God is just  Sister  God is just And I have brought all this upon my self But my Father is cruel and tyranizes over my Distress and that I cannot bear  Sister  Dear Brother  it is very wonderful and I have often thought on that Dream and of my Aunt's Prediction also about the same time  viz  That you would be brought to want Bread and to beg my Father to relieve you tho' I was in hopes it would never ha' come to that Pass  Bro  It is a Testimony that  nothing befalls us  without an Invisible Hand I acknowledge his Justice but I cannot but think that my Father is very severe and indeed very cruel  Sister  That is  because  you take the first Part of this Affair without the subsequent which is in his Design and which I hope will make all end well still if you can be perswaded to act with Temper and Patience  Bro  That is upon Supposition  I perceive  That my Condition will oblige me to make the utmost Submissions meerly for want of Subsistance whether I am sensible of the Crime or no  Sister  Dear Brother  I hope you are sensible of it If such Judgments as you have met with cannot make you sensible nothing will However as all your Dream is not come to pass I shall fulfill the rest by which besides my Respect to you that Excuse shall be taken away  viz  That you are necessitated to make Submissions for Bread I hope you will do it from a mere Sense of the Sin and of God's Anger and Justice as well as of your Father's Displeasure And that you may not be in a Necessity of doing it otherwise take that Part  of your Dream too for your present Comfort for you dream't I brought you some Money  She puts a Purse of Gold into his Hand  Bro  Dear Sister  you are too kind but I am past this kind of Consolation  Sister  As you are reduced to want Necessaries you cannot be past receiving some Satisfaction from a Supply  Bro  If  with my Estate  I had lost all Sense of Honour were grown as low spirited as I am low circumstanced I might cringe and stoop as a Beggar at a Door but if my Father seeks to suppress the Soul by the Afflictions of the Body as it is more than cruel  in him  so it is insupportable to me and I must deliver my self  Sister  Sister  If you had not at first disobliged him to the highest Degree you would ha' had Reason in what you say but if what my Father expects now be  no more  than he expected when you were in your best Circumstances no more than you made the Condition of your Return by receiving the Assurance of its being the Consequence of your going away and that even before you went and above all if it be  no more  than as a Parent and a Master of a Family he was obliged to do to preserve that Authority which you and I unhappily opposed then you cannot call his carrying it thus to you now an imposing upon you or insulting your Misery  I know  it is not in his Nature to do so if it had  Brother  why did he answer your Letters send you Relief be at the Expence of bringing you over and providing for you here has not this Pity saved your Life  Bro  But is not this Way of giving Life worse than Death I know how to deliver my self he  that dares die knows how to revenge himself of all the World  Sister  That is talking more like a Soldier  Brother  than a Christian Nay according to the Notions of Philosophy which you and I used to talk of it is talking like a Coward not like a Man of Courage since what they  call true Courage  consists in sustaining the Mind under the most pressing Afflictions and  passive Valour  is the greatest extreme of true Magnanimity whereas he that destroys himself is a Coward and dies for fear of the Bitterness of Life  Bro  There are some Circumstances which may overcome even human Nature it self and among these to be insulted In Distress is the most insupportable I could die by Torture with much more Ease  Sister  But  Dear Brother  you put the falsest Construction imaginable upon your present Circumstances My Father has put no Insult upon you and means you none You know the just Engagements he is under binds him to what he does  Bro  Is it no Insult  Sister  To bring me to his own Door and then send a Servant to tell me I must not be taken in but go to such a Place  Sister  Had there been nothing between you before that makes that Proceeding reasonable it might ha' been thought hard but you cannot but own  my Father  has been provoked  Bro  You were of another Mind  once▪ Sister  Sister  Dear Brother  I acknowledge with the greatest Affliction imaginable That I was doubly unhappy in being so that I was too much the wicked Instrument to encourage you in that course which has reduced you to this Misery and it has cost me more Tears than you can imagine to  think that I that loved you so dearly should have so much Hand in your Ruin  Bro  It has cost me more Blood than it has cost you Tears  Sister  That may be true too but my Repentance has been severe enough  Bro  And pray how has it issued I wish you would give me the short History that I may judge how to regulate my Conduct by yours  Sister  I was your unhappy Pattern before  I pray GOD extend the same Grace to you now  that as we sinned together we may be Witnesses together of our Repentance My Case is thus  Here she relates to him all her own Story from her Marriage to her Reconciliation with her Father as related in the Dialogues foregoing  Bro  Your Story is very remarkable Indeed your Husband's Conduct must be admired But  dear Sister  my Father did not deal with you as he does with me if he had it would have fired your Spirits and filled you with Indignation rather than have engaged you to an Acknowledgment  Sister  You misconstrue my Father's Intentions extremely  Bro  What Misconstruction can it be Am I not here Was I not brought to his Door Was I not shut out and turned here after Five Years Absence Has my Father or Mother or any of the Family come or so much as sent a Servant to see me  Sister  Dear Brother  do not let your Passions be your Temptation  I am come to see you  Bro  You are like your self kind and good but what's this to them  Sister  Are you supposing then  Brother  That I came without my Father's Knowledge  no Brother  I came to Discourse with you That you may be easie and that my Father may have Room to Act what his own Compassionate Inclinations move him to and to receive you with the same freedom and affection that he did me  Bro  Then I am not to Treat with you now  as my Sister  but as an Ambassador or a Mediator  Sister  I entreat you  dear Brother  let us be serious It is for your Life  Bro  My Life alas that is not worth a Treaty I wish as it is in my Power to give it it were in his to take it you should see I would die like his Son but scorn to be fed by his Charity  Sister  But Brother  I am not treating with you on the Subject of Charity I will protect you my self from the need of any one's Charity but as the Foundation of this Breach was wrong and as I hope you are now convinced of it as well as I am I would fain perswade you to a dutiful Accommodation with my Father who is ready to abate you the Ceremony if he can but have the reality of such a Repentance as God and your Duty calls for And that you may do this freely and under no Pretence of being reduced to it by your Circumstances I brought you the Relief you have nor shall you be suffered to want let it go how it will  Bro  What would you have me do  Sister  Your own Sence will Dictate that to you  Bro  I acknowledge I am very sorry I have given him Offence and especially that I went away without his Leave methinks what I suffered for that Crime should be enough  Sister  You may be sure I shall relate this with all  the Advantage I can to my Father but the Matter it self is so plain the Message you might send would as plainly put an End to it  Bro  What plainer can I say  Sister  Nay Brother you do not want me to Dictate  Bro  You would have me say I acknowledge I gave him just Cause for all he did that I acted very wickedly in opposing him in his Family Orders and that I beg Pardon of him and so fall down on my Knees  c  dear Sister if I should I am such a Criple I cannot get up again  Sister  Dear Brother  I am sorry to see how it is with you I see plainly it is not in your Heart and all that is in Appearance will be but from the Lip outward what can I do  Bro  I could have made any Submissions if he had not brought me hither to do it in this Manner but Death I think would be a much easier Portion to me now  Sister  It is in vain for you and I to dispute it  Brother  tell me then what shall I say for you or what shall I do for you  Bro  Say as above  which is the Truth That I regret so much the usage of me at last that I have nothing left to do but to satisfy my Father that I will be as short a Burden to him as possible  Sister  Dear Brother  I cannot carry such a Message consider of something fit for me to say and do not provoke him at last when you are just casting your self upon him  Bro  Tell him then  what your kindest thoughts to me can suggest only not omitting to let him know That the repulse I have met with here is greater to me than all that has befallen me That I was prepared to have asked him Pardon and in general I will do so still but that this has put me  past all Temper tell him just so and let it issue as it will  Sister  It is an uncomfortable Message for me to carry but I must do as you bid me  Bro  I cannot say less  without feigning a Temper which if I should see my Father I cannot make good or act over again  for I cannot counterfeit  and if I say more you will not be willing to carry the Message therefore let it go so come of it what will  Sister  If I decline carrying any Message it is for your sake that I may not injure your Interest with my Father and for no other Reason  Bro  I know it Sister  and understand it also I hope you do not take amiss what I said  Sister  Not at all  I am only grieved that I do not see a Prospect of doing you all the good I would do  Bro  I am such an Object now that I do not see what Condition to desire  Sister  had my Father received me kindly I should not have behaved unworthy of him tho' in so ill a Condition but this Indignity has placed me so far below any Thing of a Son that I shall be the Contempt of his Servants if I should come in  Sister  What then shall I ask of him  Bro  Nothing Sister  nothing at all Let him do just as he pleases  Sister  Dear Brother you act just the desperate Part now where will it end  Bro  In the Grave  Sister  there I would have it end  Sister  I am sorry to see you so obstinate in your own Ruin however I'll do as well as I can for you  She leaves him in this Humour not being able to obtain any Thing of him and goes directly to  her Father who was waiting impatiently to hear what his Son had said to her being himself disposed to have treated him with the utmost Kindness and Tenderness As soon as he saw her he began thus  Fa  Well Child have you seen your Brother  Dau  Yes Sir I have seen a miserable Object I am glad you did not see him at first  Fa  Why so  Dau  I believe it would break your Heart to see him he is Lame with a Wound in his Knee one Arm cut off thin and lean as one dying of a Consumption He looks pale and melancholly and indeed is to the last Degree dejected and disconsolate And withal he is mean and shabby in Cloaths I never saw such an Object  Fa  But what Temper is he in  Dau  An Accident has disordered him otherwise he is as he used to be  Fa  What Accident  Dau  Why  the Servant you sent surprized him with telling him too hastily that you had ordered him to a Lodging and not to bring him Home And then to encrease it the Coach very unhappily drove by the Door here and it grieved him so much to see himself brought to his Father's Door and could not have Leave to come in that he fell into a violent Passion the People say he raged so much all Night  tho' they knew not at what  That they were afraid he would destroy himself and he lays it so to Heart still that it grieves me I know not what to do for him  She weeps  Fa  I heard indeed that he flew out into a Passion The Fellow was a Fool to deliver his Message insolently and also to bring him by the Door  there was no need of it but as for not coming in he knew my Terms of his Return and I know that he expected no other before he came over but he might easily think my bringing him hither was in Order to receive him kindly and make his Submissions as cheap to him as I could  Dau  He would ha' scrupled no Submissions I believe if this had not happened  Fa  But he does now it seems  Dau  No really  he bid me say to you That he is very sorry he has given you Offence and especially that he went away without your Leave and that he will ask you Pardon with all his Heart  Fa  But Child  does he come to the main Point will he acknowledge his Sin against GOD and his Father in resisting the just Measures taken for the Reformation of our Family and his leaving the House upon that Account For which I solemnly declared to him  That if he went away upon that Score he should never return but as a Penitent  Dau  I hope Sir you will construe his asking you Pardon in general to contain all that  Fa  Why should I construe it  Child  a Way that he does not declare it to be understood For I have had some Information already that he resolves the contrary  Dau  I am in hopes  Sir  he will not declare that and I hope you will let his Condition plead a little for him Misery disorders our Tempers as well as our Body  Fa  But if his Misery will not allow him to make so just an Acknowledgment nor he will not free me from the Engagements which he knows I am under it is  he  refuses to come in it is not I that shut him out it is a sad Sign if so much Suffering  has not reach'd his Heart to convince him of his Sin  Dau  Perhaps he may be better Sir when his Concern at this Accident is a little over I am loath to afflict him for he is so weak I fear disturbing him may kill him  Fa  I could find in my Heart to go to him my self  Dau  I cannot say  Sir  whether it may be better or worse if he be in Temper it must needs be to his Advantage to have you see him but if his Disturbance at this Affair is not over tho' he be so low reduced I fear his obstinate Temper  Fa  What does he think That I take Occasion from his Misery to force him to a Submission  Dau  I cannot say but  something of that  is upon his Mind  Fa  Come then I have a Thought of an Expedient to remove his Resentment for I will not leave him the least Room to complain of me nor indeed do I desire or value a forced Submission if GOD has not wrought a Change upon him by his Afflictions it is not my forcing him that will do any good If he makes any Acknowledgments from the Power of his present Necessities they will be but Hypocritical and insincere and such a Kind of Penitence as will not be acceptable to GOD I am sure will be very unsatisfying to me  Dau  That's very true Sir  Fa  I'll tell you what you shall do  go back to him  and tell him I had no Design to put any Affront upon him or to suppress him in his Affliction at all and if my Servant behaved ill to him it was without my Order  Dau  That will be a great Comfort to him  I dare say  Fa  Then  tell him  he knows the Reason why I cannot agree to take him Home which Reason it is in his Power to remove when he pleases tell him that when he thinks fit to remove it effectually he shall be received with as much Affection and Kindness as he can expect but that it is below me to take Advantage of his Misery to oblige him to that Submission tho' I have good Reason to do so And that therefore I allow him to remove whether he pleases to go for his Accomodation And I will allow him  l  a Year for his Subsistance and there's  l  for him for his present Supply Thus he is left entirely free either to comply with his Father or not to comply with him as GOD shall please to influence his Mind he can complain of no Force or ill Usage on my Side  Dau  Indeed Sir I must acknowledge for him it is more than he can expect I'll carry him the News and remove him this very Night for he will break his Heart if he stays there he reckons that he is only sent into an Hospital  but whether shall I remove him  Fa  Where ever he will go  Dau  Are you pleased Sir That I shall carry him Home to my House  Fa  I will direct nothing in that  She goes away to return to her Brother and coming up to him finds him on the Bed  Sister  Brother What are you not well  Bro  Never worse Body and Mind  Sister  Come will you get up  Bro  I cannot without Help I am an Emblem of Mankind  they can fall when they will but cannot rise without Help  Sister  Come I'll help you up Alas You are no heavier than a little Child  She lifts him up  Bro  Well have you seen my Father  Sister  Dear Brother  We have such a Father as no Children in the World but us could ever offend  Bro  Why  what does he say  Sister  He is very angry with his Servant for treating you so rudely and bringing you up to the Door and has turned him out of Doors for it He says he ordered no such Thing and that you may not lay any Thing of that to Heart he has given me Leave to carry you away from hence where I will or  in short  given you Leave to remove to any Part of the Town where you please  Bro  Sister  I am willing enough to construe every Thing my Father does in the best Sense but you mistake me the Servant did not behave rudely nor was it his Fault that I was brought up to the Door the Servant only did his Message it was the Nature of the Message not the Manner of it that was my Surprize and for the rest it was only casual or providential the Way I know lay by my Father's Door and the CoachMan who knew nothing of it drove that Way of Course But it is the Matter of the Message and sending me hither as to an Hospital to be kept in Sight of his House and not admitted till I had performed  so  and  so  Sister  Well Brother however my Father says you quite mistake him he says he should have been very glad your own Inclinations had led you to give him the Satisfaction which he thinks is your Debt and which you know he cannot go from that he hoped you had been convinc'd by the hand  of GOD upon you both of your past Sin and your present Duty but that he scorns to put any Force upon you or to press you by the Violence of your Necessities to comply with him it must be GOD's Work or it can be no Satisfaction to him and therefore he leaves you to your Liberty  Bro  What does my Father call Liberty Sister he leaves me to my Liberty that is either to submit or starve come on my Knees to him or beg is this leaving me to my Liberty  Sister  Dear Brother see now how your Passions and Impatience misguide you my Father is none of those Tyrants he says he hopes God may still open your Eyes that Repentance is God's Gift it is not in his Power to force it that however you refuse or decline your Duty to him he will do his Duty to you and leave the Issue to Time To this Purpose he will allow you  l  a Year for your handsome Subsistance and has sent you  l  more for your present Supply and as you know the Conditions of Reconciliation to your Father he says you have the Keys of his Door and the Key of his Affections too in your own Pocket you may come in when you please  Bro  Did my Father say all this  Sister  Yes indeed and if I had not prevented him I believe he would ha' come and told you so himself  Bro  Why did you hinder him  Sister  Why Brother I was afraid of your Passions least by too warm Expressions you should do your self a Prejudice and lessen that affectionate Concern he has for you I know the different Influence of Words as they are well or ill placed  Bro  I am easily over come by Kindness never by Violence  Sister  Will you not allow your Father the same Effect of Flesh and Blood  Bro  Had my Father come hither in that Temper and said those Words you say from him I should ha' thrown my self at his Foot with more Submission than he can expect  Sister  Then I am sorry I hindered him I'll go and fetch him still  Bro  No do not do that I cannot promise for my self at Second Hand  Sister  O Brother You have not a Sense of the Crime tho' you have some Sense of the Kindness I hope still Time may open your Eyes for the present I would be glad to recover your Spirits and cheer your Thoughts a little that you may consider Things with more Composure will you tell me what Course you will take  Bro  Any Course you shall direct only to remove me from this Place  Sister  I doubt not it grieves you to look out of the back Window and see your Father's Garden Gate  Bro  Many other Things make this Place hateful to me  Sister  Come you shall go Home with me to my House I am sure my Dear will make you very welcome  She takes him Home in her Coach where she used him with all the Kindness and Tenderness in the World but could never bring him to any Sense of his Duty to God or his Father after some Time  having still his Allowance from his Father he  grew melancholly and disturbed and offered two or three Times to destroy himself but being recovered from that he removed  from his Sister's and God having not pleased to grant him either the Grace of Repentance for his former Sins or to prevent future he fell into an extravagant Life ill Company and drinking and died in a miserable Condition Atheistical and Impenitent having never seen his Father nor so much as desiring it till on his Deathbed being delirious he cried out for  his Father  his  Father  That he had abused his Father and begged to see his Father That he might ask him Forgiveness But he died before his Father who happened to be in the Country could be sent for  FINIS
