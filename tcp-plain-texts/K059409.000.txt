GREAT BRITAIN  _I Am not unacquainted that ever since this Book was first promis'd by way of Advertisement to the World it was greedily coveted by a great many Persons of any Tempers for the same reason that it has been condemn'd by those of a more  formal Class who thought it was calculated partly to introduce a great many new and diverting Curiosities in the way of Superstition and partly to divulge the secret Intrigues and Amours of one part of the Sex to give the other part room to make favourite Scandal the Subject of their Discourse and so to make one half of the fair Species very merry over the Blushes and the Mortifications of the other half But when they come to read the following Sheets they will find their Expectations disappointed but I hope I may say too very agreeably disappointed They will find a much more elegant Entertainment than they expected Instead of making them a Bill of Fare out of patchwork Romances of polluting Scandal the good old Gentleman who wrote the Adventures of my Life has made it his Business to treat them with a great variety of entertaining Passages which always terminate in Morals that tend to the Edification of all Readers  of whatsoever Sex Age or Profession Instead of seducing young innocent unwary Minds into the vicious delight which is too often taken in reading the gay and bewitching Chimeras of the  Caballists  and in perusing the inticing Fables of newinvented Tricks of Superstition my ancient Friend the Writer strikes at the very Root of these Superstitions and shews them how they may be satisfy'd in their several Curiosities by having recourse to time who by the Talent of the Secondsight which he so beautifully represents how Nature is so kind frequently to implant in the Minds of Men born in the same Climate with myself can tell you those things naturally which when you try to learn your selves you either run the Hazard of being impos'd upon in your Pockets by Cheats Gypsies and common Fortunetellers or else of being impos'd upon in a still worse way in your most lasting Welfare by having recourse to  Conjurers or Inchanters that deal in Black Arts and involve all their Consulters in one general Partnership of their execrable Guilt or lastly of imposing worst of all on your own selves by getting into an Itch of practising and trying the little Tricks of Female Superstition which are often more officiously handed down by the Tradition of credulous Nurses and old Women from one Generation to another than the first Principles of Christian Doctrine which 'tis their Duty to instil early into little Children But I hope when this Book comes to be pretty generally read among you Ladies as by your generous and numerous Subscriptions I have good reason to expect that it will afford a perfect Remedy and a thorough Cure to that Distemper which first took its Rise from too great a Growth of Curiosity and too large a Stock of Credulity nursed prejudicially up with you in your more tender and infant Years  Whatever young Maid hereafter has an innocent but longing Desire to know who shall be her Husband and what time she shall be marry'd will I hope when she has read in the following Sheets of a Man that can set her right in the Knowledge of those Points purely by possessing the Gift of the Secondsight sooner have recourse innocently to such a Man than use unlawful Means to acquire it such as running to Conjurers to have his Figure shewn in their inchanted Glasses or using any of those traditional Superstitions by which they may dream of their Husbands or cause visionary Shapes of them to appear on such and such Festival Nights of the Year all which Practises are not ordinarily wicked and impious but downright diabolical I hope that the next twenty ninth of  June  which is St  John  Baptist's Day I shall not see the several Pasture Fields adjacent  to this Metropolis especially that behind  Montague  House throng'd as they were the last Year with well drest young Ladies crawling busily up and down upon their Knees as if they were a parcel of Weeders when all the Business is to hunt superstitiously after a Coal under the Root of a Plantain to put under their Heads that Night that they may dream who should be their Husbands In order to shame them out of this silly but guilty Practice I do intend to have some Spies out on that Day that shall discover who they are and what they have been about and I here give notice to the Publick that this illacted Comedy if it be acted at all this Year must begin according to the Rule of their Superstition on that Day precisely at the Hour of Twelve And so much for the pretty Weeders But as you Ladies have had several Magical Traditions deliver'd to you which if you put in Exercise and Practice will  be greatly prejudicial to your Honour and your Virtue let me interpose my Counsels which will conduct you innocuously to the same end which some Ladies have labour'd to arrive at by these Impieties Give me leave first to tell you that tho' what you aim at may be arriv'd to by these Means yet these Means make that a miserable Fortune which would have been a good one because in order to know human Things beforehand you use preternatural Mediums which destroy the Goodness of the Courses which Nature her self was taking for you and annexes to them diabolical Influences which commonly carry along with them Fatalities in this World as well as the next You will therefore give me your Pardon likewise Ladies if I relate some other of these Practices which bare relation of it self after what I have said before seems to me sufficient to explode them  Another of the Nurses Prescriptions is this Upon a St  Agnes  's Night the st Day of  January  take a Row of Pins and pull out every one one after another saying a  Pater noster  or  Our Father  sticking a Pin in your Sleeve and you will dream of her you shall marry  Ben Johnson  in one of his Maskes makes some mention of this  And on sweet St  Agnes  Night  Please you with the promis'd sight  Some of Husbands some of Lovers  Which an empty Dream discovers  Now what can be more infinitely prophane than to use the Prayer of our Lord instituted in such a way  There is another Prescription which is as follows You must lie in another County and knit the left Garter about the rightlegg'd Stocking let the other  Garter and Stocking alone and as you rehearse these following Verses at every Comma knit a Knot  This Knot I knit  To know the thing I know not yet  That I may see  The Man that shall my Husband be  How he goes and what he wears  And what he does all Days and Years  Accordingly in your Dream you will see him If a Musitian with a Lute or other Instrument if a Scholar with a Book  c  Now I appeal to you Ladies what a ridiculous Prescription is this But yet as slight a thing as it is it may be of great Importance if it be brought about because then it must be construed to be done by preternatural Means and then those Words are nothing less than an Application to the Devil  Mr  Awbrey  of the Royal Society says a Gentlewoman that he knew confessed in his hearing that she used this Method and dreamt of her Husband whom she had never seen About two or three Years after as she was one Sunday at Church up pops a young  Oxonian  in the Pulpit she cries out presently to her Sister this is the very Face of the Man I saw in my Dream Sir  William Somes  's Lady did the like  Another way is to charm the Moon thus as the old Nurses give out at the first Appearance of the Moon after Newyearsday some say any other New Moon is as good go out in the Evening and stand over the Sparrs of a Gate or Stile looking on the Moon here remark that in  Yorkshire  they kneel on a Groundfast Stone and say  All hail to the Moon all hail to thee  I prithee good Moon reveal to me  This Night who my Husband shall be  You must presently after go to Bed The aforesaid Mr  Awbrey  knew two Gentlewomen that did thus when they were young Maids and they had Dreams of those that married them  But a great many of the wittiest part of your Sex laugh at these common Superstitions but then they are apt to run into worse They give themselves up to the reading of the  Cabalistical  Systems of  Sylphs  and  Gnomes  and  Mandrakes  which are very wicked and delusive Imaginations  I would not have you imagin Ladies that I impute these things as Infirmities and Frailties peculiar to your Sex No Men and great Men too  and Scholars and even Statesmen and Princes themselves have been tainted with Superstitions and where they infect the Minds of such great Personages they make the deeper Impression according to the stronger and more manly Ideas they have of them Their greater degree of Strength in the Intellect only subjects them to greater Weaknesses such was even the great  Paracelsus  the Wonder and Miracle of Learning in the Age wherein he lived and such were all his Followers Scholars Statesmen Divines and Princes that are  Talismanists  These  Talismans  that  Paracelsus  pretends to owe to the Excogitation and Invention of honest Art seem to me to be of a very diabolical Nature and to owe their Rise to being dedicated by the Author to the Heathen Gods Thus the  Cabalists  pretending to a vast Penetration into Arts and Sciences tho' all their Thoughts are Chimeras and  Extravagancies unless they be help'd by preternatural Means say they have found out the several Methods appropriated to the several Planets They have appropriated Gold to the Sun on the  Sunday  Silver to the Moon on the  Monday  Iron to  Mars  on the  Tuesday  Quicksilver to  Mercury  on the Wednesday Tin to  Jupiter  on the  Thursday  Copper or Brass to  Venus  on the  Friday  and Lead to  Saturn  on the  Saturday  The Methods they take in forming these  Talismans  are too long to dwell upon here But the Properties which they pretend belong to them are that the first  Talisman  or Seal of the Sun will make a Man beloved by all Princes and Potentates and cause him to abound with all the Riches his Heart can wish The second preserves Travellers from Danger and is favourable to Merchants Tradesmen and Workmen The third carries Destruction to any place where it is put and 'tis said that a certain  great Minister of State order'd one of these to be carry'd into  England  in the Times of the Revolution of Government caused by  Oliver Cromwell  The fourth they pretend cures Fevers and other Diseases and if it be put under the Bolster it makes the Proprietor have true Dreams in which he sees all he desires to know The fifth according to them renders a Man lucky and fortunate in all his Businesses and Undertakings It dissipates Melancholy drives away all importunate Cares and banishes panick Fears from the Mind The sixth by being put into the Liquor which any one drinks reconciles mortal Enemies makes them intimate Friends it gains the Love of all Women and renders the Proprietor very dextrous in the Art of Musick The seventh makes Women be easily brought to Bed without Pain and if a Horseman carries it in his left Boot himself and his Horse become invulnerable  This  Paracelsus  and his learned Followers say is owing to the Insluence of the Stars but I can't help arguing these Acts of diabolical Impiety But as these Arts are rarely known among the midling part of Mankind I shall neither open their Mysteries nor inveigh against them any farther  The Persons who are most to be avoided are your ordinary Fortunetelling Women and Men about this Town whose Houses ought to be avoided as a Plague or a Pestilence either because they are Cheats and Impostors or because they deal with Black Arts none of them that I know having any Pretensions to the Gift of a Secondsight Among many a few of the most notorious that I can call to mind now are as follow The first and chiefest of these mischievous Fortunetellers is a Woman that does not live far from the  Old Bailey  And  truly the Justice Hall in that Place is the properest Place for her to appear at where if she was try'd for pretending to give Charms written upon Paper with odd Scrawls which she calls Figures she would be probably convicted and very justly condemn'd and doom'd to have her  last  Journey from the  Old Bailey  to  Newgate  and from  Newgate  to  Tyburn  The other is a Fellow that lives in  Moorfields  in which Place those who go to consult him ought to live all their Lifetimes at the famous Palaces of the senseless Men He is the Successor of the famous Dr  Trotter  whose Widow he marry'd and from being a Taylor and patching Mens Garments he now cuts Fl  with his Sheers upon  considers the Heavens as a Garment and from the Spangles thereupon he calculates Nativities and sets up for a very profound Astrologer The third is an ignorant Fellow that  kaws  out strange  Predictions in  CrowAlley  of whose croaking Noise I shall here take no Notice he having been sufficiently mawl'd in the most ingenious  Spectators  These and such Counterfeits as these I would desire all Gentlemen and Ladies to avoid The only two really learned Men that I ever knew in the Art of Astrology were my good Friends Dr  Williams  and Mr  Gadbury  and I thought it necessary to pay this Esteem to their  Manes  let the World judge of them what it will I will here say no more nor hinder you any longer Gentlemen and Ladies from the Diversion which my good old Friend who is now departed this Life has prepared for you in his Book which a young Gentleman of my Acquaintance

to the World none certainly were ever held in greater Esteem than those which give us the Lives of distinguished private Men at full length and as I may say to the  Life Such curious Fragments of  Biography  are the Rarities which great Men seek after with eager Industry and when found prize them as the Chief Jewels and Ornaments that enrich their Libraries And deservedly for they are the Beauties of the greatest Men's Lives handed down by way of Example or Instruction to Posterity and commonly handed down likewise by the greatest Men Since therefore Persons distinguished for Merit in one Kind or other are the constant Subjects of such Discourses and the most Elegant Writers of each Age have been usually the only Authors who chuse upon such Subjects to employ their Pens and since Persons of the highest Rank and Dignity and  Genij  of the most refined and delicate Relish are frequently curious enough to be the Readers of them and to esteem them the most valuable Pieces in a whole Collection of Learned Works It is a Wonder to me that when any Man's Life has something in it peculiarly Great and Remarkable in its Kind it should not move some more skilful Writer than my self to give the Publick a Taste of it because it must be at least vastly Entertaining if it be not which is next to impossible immensly Instructive and Profitable withal  If ever the Life of any Man under the Sun was Remarkable this Mr  Duncan Campbell  's which I am going to treat upon is so to a very eminent Degree  It affords such variety of Incidents and is accompanied with such diversity of Circumstances that it includes within it what must yield entire Satisfaction to the most learned and Admiration to Persons of a moderate Understanding The Prince and the Peasant will have their several Ends of worthy Delight in reading it and Mr  Campbell  's Life is of that Extent that it concerns and collects as I may say within it self every Station of Life in the Universe Besides There is a Demand in almost every Page that relates any new Act of his for the finest and closest Disquisitions that Learning can make upon human Nature to account how those Acts could be done by him For he daily practised and still practices those Things naturally which puts Art to the rack to find out how Nature can so operate in him and his fleshly Body by these Operations is a living practical System or Body of new Philosophy which exceeds even all those that have hitherto been compounded by the Labor and Art of many Ages  If one that had speculated deep into abstruse matters and made it his Study not only to know how to assign natural Reasons for some strange new Acts that looked like Miracles by being peculiar to the individual Genius of some particular admired Man but carrying his Enquiry to a much greater height had speculated likewise what might  possibly be achieved by human Genius in the full Perfection of Nature and had laid it down as a  Thesis  by strong Arguments that such Things might be compassed by a human Genius if in its true degree of Perfection as are the hourly Operations of the Person's Life I am writing he would have been counted a wild Romantick Enthusiast instead of a Natural Philosopher Some of the wisest would be Infidels to so new and so refined a Scheme of Thinking and demand Experiment or cry it was all against Reason and would not allow the least Tittle to be true without it Yet the Man that had found out so great a Mystery as to tell us what Might be done by Human Genius as it is here actually done would have been a great Man within himself but wanting farther Experimental Proof could lay no claim to the Belief of others or consequently to their Esteem But how great then is the Man who makes it constantly his Practice actually to Do what would not otherwise have been thought to be of such a Nature as might ever be acquired by mortal Capacity tho' in its full Complement of all possible Perfection He is not only great within himself he is great to the World his Experiments force our Belief and the amazing Singularity of those Experiments provokes both our Wonder and Esteem  If any learned Man should have advanced this Proposition that meer human Art could  give to the DeafMan what should be equal to his Hearing and to the DumbMan an equivalent for his want of Speech so that he should converse as freely almost as other Hearing or Talking Persons that he might tho' born Deaf be by Art taught how to Read Write and understand any Language as well as Students that have their Hearing would not the World and many even of the Learned Part of it say that nothing could be more extravagantly Wild more Mad and Frantick The learned Dr  Wallis  Geometry Professor of  Oxford  did first of all lay down this Proposition and was counted by many to have overshot the Point of Learning and to have been the Author of a whimsical Thesis And I should not have wondered if after a Man's having asserted This might be done before it was actually done some blind devout People in those Days had accused him of Heresy and of attributing to Men a Power of working Miracles The Notion of the  Antipodes  was by the most learned Men of the Age in which St  Augustin  lived and by the Great St  Austin  himself treated in no milder a manner yet if the Ability of teaching the Deaf and the Dumb a Language proved a Truth in Experience afterwards ought not those to turn their Contempt into Admiration ought not those very People to Vote him into the Royal Society for laying down this Proposition who before it proved true in Fact would have been very  forward to have sent him to  Bedlam  The first Instance of this Accomplishment in a Dumb Person was proved before King  Charles  II by this same Dr  Wallis  who was a Fellow of the  Royal Society  and one of the most ingenious of that Society  But notwithstanding this should I come afterwards and say that there is now living a Deaf and Dumb Man and born so who could by dint of his own Genius teach all others Deaf and Dumb to Read Write and Converse with the Talking and Hearing Part of Mankind some would I warrant very religiously conclude that I was about to introduce some strange new MiracleMonger and Impostor into the World with a Design of setting up some new Sect of Antichristianism as formidable as that of the  Brachmans  Should I proceed still farther and say that this same Person so Deaf and Dumb might be able also to shew a presaging Power or kind of prophetical Genius if I may be allowed the Expression by telling any strange Persons he never saw before in his Life their Names at first Sight in Writing and by telling them the past Actions of their Lives and predicting to them determined Truths of future Contingencies notwithstanding what Divines say that  In futuris contingentibus non datur determinata veritas  would not they conclude that I was going to usher in a new  Mahomet  Since therefore there does exist such a Man in  London  who actually is Deaf  and Dumb and was born so who does Write and Read and Converse as well as any Body who teaches others Deaf and Dumb to Write and Read and Converse with any Body who likewise can by a presaging Gift set down in Writing the Name of any Stranger at first Sight tell him his past Actions and predict his future Occurrences in Fortune and since he has practised this Talent as a Profession with great Success for a long Series of Years upon innumerable Persons in every State and Vocation of Life from the Peeress to the WaitingWoman and from the Lady Mayoress to the Milliner and Sempstress will it not be wonderfully Entertaining to give the World a perfect History of this so singular a Man's Life And while we are relating the pleasant Adventures with such prodigious Variety can any thing be more agreeably instructive in a New Way than to intersperse the Reasons and account for the manner how Nature having a mind to be remarkable performs by him Acts so mysterious  I have premised this Introduction compounded of the Merry and the Serious with the Hopes of engaging many curious People of all sorts to be my Readers even from the airy nice Peruser of Novels and Romances neatly Bound and finely Gilt to the grave Philosopher that is daily thumbing over the musty and tatter'd Pieces of more solid Antiquity  I have all the Wonders to tell that such a merry kind of a Prophet has told to Entertain the Fancies of the first gay Tribe by which means I may intice them into some solid Knowledge and Judgment of Human Nature and I have several solid Disquisitions of Learning to make Accounting for the manner of these Mysterious Operations never touched upon before in due Form and Order by the Hands of the Antient or Modern Sages that I may Bribe the Judgment of this last Grave Class so far as to endure the Intermixing of Entertainment with their severer Studies  CHAP I Mr CAMPBELL'S  Descent Family Birth  c  OF the Goodness and Antiquity of the Name and Family of this Gentleman No body can ever make any Question He is a  Campbell  Lineally Descended from the House of  Argyll  and bears a distant Relation to the present Duke of that Name in  Scotland  and who is now Constituted a Duke of  England  by the Stile and Title of the Duke of  Greenwich  It happens frequently that the Birth of Extraordinary Persons is so long disputed by different People each claiming him for their own that the real p  where he first took  Breath grows at last dubious And thus it fares with the Person who is the Subject of the following Sheets as therefore it is my Proposal to have a strict regard to  Historical Faith  so am I obliged to tell the Reader that I can with no certainty give an Account of him till after he was Three Years Old from which Age I knew him even to this Day I will Answer for the Truths which I impart to the Publick during that Time and as for his Birth and the Circumstances of it and how the first Three Years of his Life passed I can only deliver them the same Account I have received from others and leave them to their own Judgments whether it ought to be deemed Real or Fabulous  The Father of our Mr  Duncan Campbell  as these relate the Story was from his Infancy of a very curious inquisitive Nature and of an Enterprizing Genius and if he heard of any thing Suprizing to be seen the Difficulty in Practise was enough to recommend to him the attempting to get a sight of it at any rate or any Hazard It is certain that during some Civil broils and troubles in  Scotland  the Grandfather of our Mr  Campbell  was driven with his Wife and Family by the Fate of War into the Isle of  Schetland  where he lived many Years and during his Residence there Mr  Archibald Campbell  the Father of our  Duncan Campbell  was Born  Schetland  lies NorthEast from  Orkney  between and Degrees of Latitude The largest Isle of  Schetland  by the Natives called the  MainLand  is sixty Miles in Length from SouthWest to the NorthEast and from sixteen to one Mile in Breadth  The People who Live in the smaller Isles have abundance of Eggs and Fowl which Contributes to maintain their Families during the Summer  The ordinary Folks are mostly very nimble and active in climbing the Rocks in quest of those Eggs and Fowl This Exercise is far more diverting than Hunting and Hawking among us and would certainly for the Pleasure of it be followed by People of greater Distinction was it not attended with very great Dangers sufficient to turn sport into sorrow and which have often proved fatal to those who too eagerly pursue their Game Mr  Archibald Campbell  however delighted extreamly in this way of Fowling and used to condescend to mix with the common People for Company because none of the Youths of his Rank and Condition were venturesome enough to go along with him  The most remarkable Experiment of this sort is at the Isle called the  Noss  of  Brassah  The  Noss  standing at sixteen fathom distance from the side of the Opposite Main the higher and lower Rocks have two Stakes fastened in each of them and to these there  are Ropes tied Upon the Ropes there is an Engine hung which they call a Cradle and in this a Man makes his way over from the greater to the smaller Rocks where he makes a Considerable purchase of Eggs and Fowl but his return being by an Ascent makes it the more Dangerous tho' those on the great Rock have a Rope tied to the Cradle by which they draw it and the Man safe over for the most part Over this Rock Mr  Archibald Campbell  and five others were in that manner let down by Cradles and Ropes but before they could be all drawn back again it grew Dark and their Associates not daring to be benighted were forced to withdraw and Mr  Campbell  was the unfortunate Person left behind having wandered too far and not minded how the Day declined being intent on his Game He passed that Night you may easily guess without much Sleep and with great Anxiety of Heart The night too as he lay in the open Air was to add to his Misfortune as Boisterous and Tempestuous as his own mind but in the end the Tempest proved very happy for him The Reader is to understand that the  Hamburghers Bremeners  and  Hollanders  carry on a great Fish Trade there Accordingly a  Holland  Vessel that was just coming in the sound of  Brassah  was by this Tempest driven into a Creek of the Rock which Nature had made into a Harbonr  and they were Providentially saved from the bottom of the Sea by a Rock from which humanly speaking they could expect nothing but Destruction and being sent to the bottom of that Sea As never could a Man be taken hold of with so sudden and surprizing a Disaster so no body could meet with a more sudden and surprizing Relief than Mr  Campbell  found when he saw a Ship so near He made to the Vessel and begged the  Hollanders  to take him in they asked him what he would give them or said the Barbarous Sailors we will even leave you where you are he told them his disaster but they asked Money and nothing else would move them As he knew them a self interested People he bethought himself that if he should tell them of the plenty of Fowls and Eggs they would get there he might not only be taken in a Passenger but made a Partner in the Money arising from the Stock It succeeded accordingly when he proposed it the whole Crew were all at Work and in four hours pretty well stored the Vessel and then returning on board set Sail for  Holland  They offered Mr  Campbell  to put him in at his own Island But having a mind to see  Holland  and being a Partner to learn their way of Merchandize which he thought he might turn to hi Country Mens Advantage he told them he would go the Voyage out with them and see  the Country of those who were his Deliverers a necessary way of Speech when one has a Design to sooth  Barbarians  who but for Interest would have left him unredeemed and for ought they knew a perpetual sole Inhabitant of a Dreadful Rock incompassed round with Precipices some three hundred Fathom high Not so the Islanders who are wrongly called a Savage set of Mortals no they came in quest of him after so bitter a Night not doubting to find him but fearing to find him in a Lamentable Condition they hunted and ransacked every little hole and corner in the Rock but all in vain In one place they saw a great Slaughter of Fowls enough to serve forty Families for a Week and then they Guessed tho' they had not the ill Fortune to meet the Eagles frequently noted to hover about those Isles that they might have Devoured part of him on some Precipice of the Rock and dropt the Remnant into the Sea Night came upon them and they were afraid of falling into the same Disaster they went to relieve Mr  Campbell  from They returned each to their proper Basket and were drawn up safe by their respective Friends who were amazed that one Basket was drawn up empty which was let down for Mr  Campbell  and that there was not the least Intelligence to be had Concerning him but the Suppositious Story of his having been Devour'd by  Eagles The Story was told at Home and with the Lamentation of the whole Family and all his Friends he was looked upon to be Murthered or Dead  Return we now to Mr  Archibald Campbell  still alive and on Board the  Holland  Vessel secure as he thought within himself that from the Delivery he lately had by the Gift of Providence he was not intended to be liable to any more Misfortunes and Dangers of Life in the Compass of so small a Voyage But his Lot was placed otherwise in the Book of Fate than he too fondly imagined His Time of Happiness was dated some Pages lower down and more rubs and difficulties were to be Encountered with before his Stars intended to lead him to the Port of Felicity Just as he Arrived within sight of  Amsterdam  a Terrible Storm arose and in Danger of their Lives for many Hours they Weathered out the Tempest and a Calm promising fair afresh they made to the Coast of  Zealand  but a new Hurricane prevented the Ship from coming there also and after having lost their Masts and Rigging they were driven into  Lapland  There they went a Shore in order to carren and repair their Ship and take in Provisions while the Ship was Repairing by the  Dutch  our Islander made merry with the Inhabitants being the most inclined to their Superstitious Customs he there became acquainted  with a very Beautiful Woman who fell in Love with him and after a very short space of Time he Married her About the Time when the Ship departed his Wife who was very Rich was big with Child of a Son namely Mr  Duncan Campbell  He wrote a Letter by the Master of the Vessel to his Parents in  Schetland  concerning the various Adventures he had met with which was delivered the  June  following about the time of Fishing to his Parents and several Persons had Copies thereof and for ought I know some retain them to this very Day sure I am that many remember the Particulars of this Surprizing Affair who are now living in that Island  The Letter being very Remarkable and Singular in all its Circumstances I shall present it the Reader Word for Word as it was given into my Hands together with some others which he wrote afterwards in all which I am assured by very credible Persons and undoubted Authorities there are not the least Alterations but what the Version of it from the then  Scotch  Manner of Expression into a more Modern  English  Dress made absolutely necessary  My Dearest FATHER  THE same odd Variety of Accident which put it out of my Power to be Personally present with you for so long a time put it likewise out of my Power to write to you At last Fortune has so ordered it that I can send a Letter to you before I can come my self and it is written Expresly to tell you the Adventures I have met with which haved etained me this tedious Space of Time from my Dear Father and because the same Captain of a Ship that brings you this might as easily have brought your Son to speak for himself I shall in the next place lay before you the necessity there is for my stay a little longer among the strange Natives of the Country where I now Inhabit and where I am in a manner become Naturalized  You have no doubt of it been informed by my Companions some of whom I hope got safe back again if not all that I was lost where many a brave Man has perished before me by going over the high Precipices of the Mountain  Brassah  in a Basket sliding down by a Rope I must suppose I have given you the Anguish of a Father for a Son who you thought had lost his Life by such a Fool hardy Attempt and I implore your Pardon with all the Power of Filial Contrition Penitence and Duty You have always shewed me such  singular Marks of Paternal Affection that I know your Receipt of this Letter will fill your Heart with Joy and Cause you to Sign me an Absolution and free Pardon for all the Errors I have Committed and think the Sufferings I have undergone for my Rashness and Indiscretion a sufficient Attonement for my Crime of making you by my Undutifulness a Partner of my Sorrows To free you the more from this uneasiness I know I need only tell you that every Grief of mine is gone excepting one which is that I must still lose the Pleasure of seeing you a little longer There was never surely a more bitter Night than that which must by me be for ever remembered when I was lost in the Mountain of  Brassah  where I must for aught I know have liv'd for ever a wild single Inhabitant but that the Storm which made the Night so uneasie to me rendered the first Approach of Daylight beyond Measure Delightful The first Providential Glimpse of the Morning gave me a view of a Ship driven by the Tempest into a Creek of the Rock that was by Nature formed like a Harbour a Miraculous Security of Deliverance as I thought both for the Ships Crew and my self I made all the haste I could you may be sure to them and I found them to be  Dutchmen  that were come for Fish but in lieu of Fish I instructed them to Load it with Eggs and Fowl which we compassed very happily in a short  Space of Time and I was to be a Sharer with the Captain in the Lading and Bargained to go for  Holland  to see the Sale and the Nature of Traffick but when we were at Sea after much bad weather we made towards  Zealand  but we were driven upon the Coast of  Finland  by a new Storm and thence into  Lapland  where I now am and from whence I send you this Letter  I could not come into a place so properly named for my Reception As I had been Undutiful to you and Fortune seemed to make me an Exile or a Banished Man by way of Punishment for the Vices of my Youth so  Lapland  which is a Word origiginally derived from the  Finland  Word  Lappi  that is Exiles and from the  Swedish  Word  Lap  signifying Banished from which two Kingdoms most of our Inhabitants were Banished hither for not embracing the Christian Religion was certainly the properest Country in the World to receive Me  When first I entered this Country I thought I was got into quite another World The Men are all of them Pigmies to our Tall Brawny  Highlanders  they are generally speaking not above Three Cubits high insomuch that tho' the whole Country of  Lapland  is immensly large and I have heard it reckoned by the Inhabitants to be above a Hundted  German  Leagues in Length and Fourscore and Ten in Breadth Yet I was  the Tallest Man there and looked upon as a Giant The District in which I live now is called  Uma Lapmark  You must understand Sir that when I Landed at North Cape in  KimiLapmark  another District of  Lapland  there was at that time a most Beautiful Lady come to see a Sick Relation of her Father's who was Prefect or Governor of  Uma Lapmark  which is a Post of Great DistinctionThis Lady by being frequently in the Company of  French  Merchants who Traffick now and then in that Province of  Uma Lapmark  understood French and having heard of a Man six Foot and a half high desired to see me and when I came she happened mightily to like my Person and she talked  French  which when I answered she made great Signs of Joy that she could Communicate her Sentiments to me and she told me who she was how Rich and that not one in the Company besides could understand a Syllable we said and so I might speak my Mind freely to her she told me the Customs of the Country that it was divided into Cantons like our Shires and those Cantons into Rekars or certain Grounds allotted to Families that are just like our Clans As she was beyond measure Beautiful she was extreamly good humoured a thing rarely to be met among  Lapland  Women of a better Stature than her Country Women and very Rich and of good Birth I thought  it would be a prodigious Turn of Fortune for a Man in my Circumstances if I could make any Progress in her Heart which she seemed a little to open to me in such a manner for the beginning as if such a successful Event if managed with Prudence might not be despaired off Souls that are Generous are apt to Love and Compassion is the best introducer of Love into a Generous Bosom and that was the best Stock I had to go upon in my Courtship I told her of all my Calamities my Dangers and my Escapes the Goodness of my Birth as being Allied to one of the Greatest Nobles in our Island and still she would ask me to tell it her over again tho' every time I told it just at such and such Passages she was forced to drop the Tears from her Eyes In fine I grew more in Love with her out of a Sense of Gratitude now than by the Power of her Charms before The matter in a few Days went so far that she owned to me I had her Heart As to Marriage I did not then know the Custom of the Nation I thought that if it proved only Dangerous to me I loved her so well that I intended to Marry her tho' the Law was to Pronounce me Dead for it but I did not know whether it might not be Perilous for her too to Engage in such a State with me and I resolved in that Case rather to be singly unhappy than to involve her in Distress and make her the fair Companion  of my Woes I would not tell her so for fear she should out of Love hide from me those Dangers and therefore using a kind sort of Dissimulation I conjured her to tell me the Laws and Customs of Marriages in that Country to a tittle and that nothing should hinder us from Happiness She told me exactly as I find since Our Marriage said she will be very hard to Compass provided we follow the strict Rule of the Country For our Women here are bound not to see the Man who makes their Addresses to them in some time His way of Courtship is to come to the Parents and his nearest Friends and Relations must make her Father Presents and Supplicate him like a King to Grant him his Daughter The Courtship often lasts two or three Years and sometimes has not its Effect at last But if it has the Woman is dragged by her Father and Brother to Church as unwilling to go to be Married which is looked upon as a greater part of Modesty in her according to the greater Disinclination she shews My Father and Brother said she will both be against it You have no Relations in this Country to move your Suit I cannot be so Hypocritical as to be dragged unwillingly to him I own I desire for my Lawful Husband and therefore as I have an Inclination to you and I dare own I have I will not follow those methods which I disapprove I have talked with several  Swedes  and several Polite  Frenchmen  about their Manner of Espousals and I am told that when Souls are naturally united by Affection the Couple so mutually and reciprocally Loving tho' they had rather have their Parents leave if likely to be got yet unwilling to be disappointed only go to the next Minister's and Marry for better for worse This way I approve of for where two Persons naturally love each other the rest is nothing but a modest restraint to their Wishes and since 'tis only Custom my own Reason teaches me there is no Error Committed nor any harm done in breaking thro' it upon so commendable an Occasion I have added she a Thousand RainDeer belonging to me beyond my Father's Power of taking away and a Third share in a Rekar or Clan that is ten Leagues in Compass in the Byar or Canton of  Uma Lapmark  This is at my own Disposal and it is all your own if you please to accept of it with me Our Women are very coy when they are Courted tho' they have never so much an Inclination to their Suitor but good Reason and the Commerce I have had with Persons of Politer Nations than ours is teach me that this proceeds entirely from Vanity and Affectation and the greatest Proof of a Women's Modesty Chastity and Sincerity certainly consists contrary to the general corrupted opinion in yielding up  her self soon into the Arms of the Man she Loves For she that can dally with a Heart she prizes can give away her Heart when she is once baulked to any Man even tho' she dislikes him You must Judge my Dear Father I must be touched with a Woman that was exceeding Beautiful beyond any of her Nation and who had Thoughts as Beautiful as her Person I therefore was all in Rapture and longed for the Matrimony but still loved her enough to propose the Question I resolved to her  viz  If it would not be in her Nation accounted a Clandestine Marriage and prove of great Damage to her  To this she answered with all the Wisdom which could be expected from a Woman who had given such Eminent Tokens of her Judgment on other points amidst a Nation so Barbarous in its Manners and so Corrupt in its Principles as  Lapland  is I am said she answerable to my Father for nothing by our Laws having no Portion of him but only what was presented me by my Relations at my Birth according to Custom in Lands and RainDeer My Father is but Deputy Governor 'tis a  Swede  who is the Governor of  Uma  and if I pay to him at every Mart and Fair the due Tribute which must either consist of Fifty RainDeer or one hundred and fifty Rixdollars he will have the Priest that Marry's us present at the Court of Justice according  to our Custom and keep us in Possession of our Rights that we may be enabled to pay Tribute to the Crown of  Sweden  Indeed before the Abolition of the  Birkarti  which were our Native Judges we could not have Married thus without Danger to us both but now there is none at all  My Dear Father  You must easily imagin that I could not help embracing with all tenderness so dear and so lovely a Woman In fine I am Married to her I have lived very happily hitherto and am now grown more happy for she is big with Child and like before my Letter comes to your Hands to make you a Grandfather of a pretty Boy You will perhaps wonder that I name the Sex of the Child before it comes into the World But we have a way in  Lapland  of finding that out which tho' some Judicious People call Superstitious I am really perswaded of by Experience and therefore I indulged my dear Wife's curiosity when she signified to me she had a Mind to make the usual Tryal whether the Child she was going to be Delivered of would be a Boy or a Girl  You must understand  My Dear Father  the People here Judge of the Sex of the Child by the Moon unto which they compare a Bigbellied Woman If they see a Star appear just above the Moon it is a sign it will be a Boy but if the Star be just below the Moon they con  ecture her to be big with a Girl  This Observation and Remark of  Laplanders  has I know been accounted by some and those Wise and Judicious Men too to be ridiculously Superstitious but I have been led into an easie belief of this Mystery by a Mistress that is Superior to Wisdom it self Constant and therefore probably Infallible Experience I therefore indulged my Wife in this her request and went with her to the Ceremony the Star appeared above the Moon which Prognosticates a Boy which I wish may and I scarce doubt will prove true and when she is brought to Bed I will send you word of it It is remarkable likewise that a Star was seen just before the Moon which we also count a very good Omen For it is a custom likewise here in  Lapland  to consult the Moon as an Oracle about the Health and Vigour of the Child If a Star be seen just before the Moon we count it a sign of a lusty and well grown Child without Blemish if a Star comes just after we reckon it a token that the Child will have some defect or deformity or die soon after it is Born  Having thus told you the Manners of the Country I live in at present as much at large as the space of a Letter will permit and related to you my own happy Circumstances and the kindly Promises of the Heavens that are Ushering in the Birth of my Child I would not have you think that I addict my  self to the Superstitions of the Country which are very many and groundless and arising partly from the remainder of  Pagan  Worship which is still Cultivated among some of the more obstinate Inhabitants I have on the Contrary since I Married her endeavoured to repay my Wife's Temporal Blessings to me with those that are endless instructed her in all the Points of Religion and made her perfectly a Christian and she by her Devotion and Prayers for me makes me such amends for it that I hope in us two St  Paul  's saying will be verified  viz That the Woman shall be sanctified in her Husband and the Husband shall be sanctified in his Wife  However I must take notice in this Place with all due deference to Christianity that tho' I am obliged to applaud the Prudence and Piety of  Charles  the Ninth of  Sweden  who Constituting  Swedish  Governors over this Country Abrogated their Practise of Superstitions and Art Magick upon pain of Death Yet that King carried the point too far and intermingled with these Arts the pretensions to the gift of a second sight which you know how frequent it is with us in  Scotland  and which I assure you my Wife tho' she durst not Publickly own it for fear of incurring the penalty of those  Swedish  Laws does as it were inherit for all her Ancestors before her have had it from time Immemorial to  a greater degree than ever I knew any of our Country Women or Country Men  One day this last Week she distracted me between the extreams of Joy and Sorrow She told me I should see you shortly and that my coming Son would grow to be one of the most remarkable Men in  England  and  Scotland  for his Power of Foresight But that I should speedily lose her and meet with difficulties in my own Country in the same manner as my Father meaning you Sir had done before me and on the same Account  viz  Of Civil broils and intestine Wars in  Scotland  These Unfortunate parts of her Relation I would not conceal from you because the veracity of her Notions should appear if they are true tho' you may be sure I much wish they all may prove false to the very last excepting that wherein she tells me my Son will be greatly remarkable and that I shall shortly see my Dear Father which I daily long for and will endeavour to do as soon as possible Pray remember me to all Friends Being  Honoured Sir  Your Most Dutiful and Loving Son  Archibald Campbell  The Second Letter  I Am now the happiest Man alive the Prosperous part of my Wife's Predictions which I mentioned to you in my last is come in some measure to pass The Child she has brought me proves a Boy and as fine a one as I ever beheld if fondness for my own makes me not blind And sure it can't be fondness because other plain Circumstances joined at his birth to prove it a more than ordinary Remarkable one He was born with a Cawl upon his Head which we count one of the Luckiest Signs that can be in Nature he had likewise three Teeth ready Cut thro' the Gums and we reckon that an undeniable Testimony and Promise given to the World by Nature that she intends such a Person for her extraordinary Favourite and that he is born for great Things which I daily beg of Heaven may come to pass  Since I have known for some Months what it is to be a Father it adds a Considerable weight to those Affections which I had for my Wife I thought that my Tenderness for her was at the height of perfection before which shews how little we know of those Parts of Nature that we have yet never tryed and of which we have not yet been allotted our share to  act upon the Stage of Life I find that I did love her then as well as a Husband could love a Wife that is a Wife without a Child but the love to a Wife that has a Child is a feeling wonderful and inexpressibly different A Child is the Seal and the Pledge of Love Meditating upon this has likewise doubled my Affection to you I loved you before as a Son and because as such I felt your Tenderness but my Love is much increased now because I know the tenderness which you felt for me as a Father With these pleasing images of thought I often keep you nearer company at this vast distance than when I lived irregularly under your Eye These reflexions render a Solitary Life dear to me And tho' I have no manner of Acquaintance with her Relations who hate me as I am told nor indeed with almost any of the Inhabitants but my own Domesticks and those I am forced to deal with yet I have as much methinks as I wish for unless I could come over to  Schetland  and live with you which I the more ardently desire because I think I and my Wife could be true comforts to you in your advanced Years now I know what living truly is I am daily perswading my Wife to go with me but she denies me with kind Expressions and says she owes too much to the Place however less pleasant in it self than other Climates where she had the happiness of first joining  Hands with me in Wedlock ever to part from it But I must explain how I ask and how she refuses I resolved never directly and downrightly to ask her because I know she can refuse me nothing And that would be bearing hard upon the Goodness of her Will But my way of perswading her consists in endeavouring to make her in Love with the Place by agreeable Descriptions of it and likewise of the Humane temper of the People so that I shortly shall induce her to signifie to me that it is her own Will to to come with me and then I shall seem rather to consent to her Will than to have moved it over to my own These hopes I have of seeing my dear Father very shortly and I know such News would make this Letter which I therefore send more acceptable to him to whom I will be  A most Dutiful and Affectionate Son till Death  Archibald Campbell  P S  If I cannot bring my Wife to change this Country for another I have brought her to that pitch of Devotion that whenever Providence which notwithstanding her Predictions I hope will be long yet shall call her to change this World for another it will  be happy with her there she joins with me in begging your Blessing to me her self and our little  Duncan  whom we Christened so out of a respect to the Name you bear  The Third Letter  My Dear FATHER  I Am lost in GriefI had just brought my Wife her that was my Wife for I have none now I have lost all Joy in the Mind of coming over to be a comfort to you But now Grief will let me say no more than that I am coming to beg comfort from you and by this I prepare you to receive when he comes a Son in Tears and Mourning  Archibald Campbell  P S  I have a Babe not much above two Years old must bear the hardships of Travelling over the Ice and all thro'  Muscovy  for no Ships can stir here for many Months and I cannot bear to live in this inhospitable Place where she dyed that only could make it easie to me one Moment beyond the first opportunity I have of leaving it she is in Heaven that should make me easie but I cannot I am not so good a Christian as she was I am lost and ruined  CHAP II After the Death of Mr  Duncan Campbell's  Mother in  Lapland  His Father  Archibald  returned with his Son to  Scotland  His Second Marriage and how his Son was taught to Write and Read  MR  Archibald Campbell  having buried his  Lapland  Lady returned to  Scotland  and brought over with him his Son Mr  Duncan Campbell  By that time he had been a Year in his own Country he Married a Second Wife a Lady whom I had known very well for some Years and then I first saw the Boy but as they went into the Western Islands I saw them not again in three Years She being quite contrary to the cruel way much in Use among StepMothers very fond of the Boy was accustomed to say she did and would always think him her own Son The Child came to be about four Years of Age as she has related to me the Story since and not able to speak one Word nor to hear any noise the Father of him used to be mightily oppressed with Grief and complain heavily to his new Wife who was no less perplexed that a Boy so pretty the Son of so particular a Woman which he had made his Wife by strange Accidents and Adventures and a Child coming  into the World with so many amazing Circumstances attending his Birth should lose those precious Senses by which alone the social Commerce of Mankind is upheld and maintained and that he should be deprived of all Advantages of Education which could raise him to the Character of being the great Man that so many concurring incidents at his Nativity promised and betokened he would be  One day a Learned Divine who was of the University of  Glascow  but had visited  Oxford  and been acquainted with the chief Men of Science there happening to be in conversation with the Mother in Law of this Child she related to him her Son's Misfortunes with so many Marks of Sorrow that she moved the good old Gentleman's Compassion and excited in him a desire to give her what Relief and Consolation he could in this unhappy case His particular inclination to do her good Offices made him reccollect that at the time he was at  Oxford  he had been in Company with one Doctor  Wallis  a Man famous for Learning who had told him that he had taught a born Deaf and Dumb Man to Write and to Read and even to utter some sounds articulately with his Mouth and that he told him he was then going to Commit to Print the Method he made use of in so Instructing that Person that others in the like unfortunate Condition  might receive the same Benefits and Advantages from other Masters which his Deaf and Dumb Pupil had received from him A Dumb Man recovering his Speech or a Blind Man gaining his Sight or a Deaf one getting his Hearing could not be more overjoyed than Mrs  Campbell  was at these unexpected Tidings and she wept for Gladness when he told it The Good Gentleman Animated and Encouraged her with the kindest Promises and to keep alive her hopes assured her he would send to one of the chief Booksellers in  London  to enquire after the Book who would certainly procure it him if it was to be got and that afterwards he would peruse it diligently make himself Master of Doctor  Wallis  his Method and tho' he had many great Works upon his Hands at that time he would steal from his other Studies leisure enough to compleat so Charitable an Office as teaching the Dumb and Deaf to Read and to Write and give her Son who was by  Nature  Deprived of them the Advantages of Speech as far as  Art  would permit that  Natural  Defect to be supplied by her Powerful Interposition  When the Mother came Home the Child who could hear no knocking and therefore it must be by a strange and inexplicable instinct in Nature was the first that ran to the Door and falling in a great fit of Laughter  a thing it was not much used to before having on the contrary rather a Melancholly cast of Complexion it clung round its Mother's Knees incessantly embracing and kissing them as if just at that time it had an insight into what the Mother had been doing for it and into its own Approaching Relief from its Misery  When the Mother came with the Child in her hand to the Father to tell him the welcome News the Child burst afresh into a great fit of Laughter which continued for an unusual space of time and the scene of such reciprocal Affection and Joy between a Wife and her own Husband on so signal an occasion is a thing easier to be felt by Parents of a good Disposition imagining themselves under the same Circumstance with regard to a Child they loved with fondness than to be expressed or described by the Pen of any Writer But it is certain whenever they spoke of this Affair as any Body who knows the impatience of Parents for the Welfare of an only Child may guess they must be often Discoursing it over and wishing the time was come the Boy who used seldom so much as to smile at other times and who could never hear the greatest noise that could be made would constantly look wishfully in their Faces and laugh immoderately which is a plain Indication that there was then a wonderful Instinct in Nature  as I said before which made him foretaste his good Fortune and if I may be allowed the Expression The Dawnings as it were of the Second sight were then Pregnant within him  To confirm this the happy hour of his Deliverance being come and the Doctor having procured Mr  Wallis  's Book came with great Joy and desired to see his Pupil scarce were the Words out of his Mouth when the Child happened to come into the Room and running towards the Doctor fell on his Knees kissed his Hand eagerly and Laughed as before which to me is a Demonstration that he had an insight into the Good which the Doctor intended him  It is certain that several Learned Men who have written concerning the  Second sight  have Demonstrated by uncontestable Proofs and undeniable Arguments that Children nay even Horses and Cows see the  Second sight  as well as Men and Women advanced in Years But of this I shall Discourse at large in its proper Place having allotted a whole future Chapter for that same Subject of Second sightedness  In about half a Year the Doctor taught his little Dumb Pupil First to know his Letters then to name any thing whatsoever to leave off some Savage Motions which he had taken of his own accord before to signifie his Mind by and to impart his  Thoughts by his Fingers and his Pen in a Manner as intelligible and almost as swift thro' the Eyes as that is of conveying our Ideas to one another by our Voices thro' the Condites and Portholes of the Ears But in little more than two Years he could Write and Read as well as any Body because a great many People cannot conceive this and others pretend it is not to be done in Nature I will a little Discourse upon Doctor  Wallis  's Foundation and shew in a Manner obvious to the most ignorant how this hitherto Misterious help may be easily Administred to the Deaf and the Dumb which shall be the Subject of the ensuing Chapter  But I cannot Conclude this without telling the handsome saying with which this Child when not quite Six Years old as soon as he thought he could express himself well payed his first Acknowledgment to his Master and which Promised how great his future Genius was to be when so Witty a Child ripened into Man The Words he wrote to him were these only altered into  English  from the  Scotch  Sir It is no little Work you have Accomplished My Thanks are too poor amends The World Sir shall give you Thanks for as I could not have expressed my self without your Teaching me so those that can talk tho' they have Eyes cannot see the Things  which I can see and shall tell them so that in doing me this you have done a General Service to Mankind  CHAP III The Method of Teaching  Deaf  and  Dumb  Persons to Write Read and understand a Language  IT is I must consess in some Measure amazing to me that Men of any Moderate Share of Learning should not naturally conceive of themselves a plain Reason for this Art and know how to Account for the Practicability of it the Moment they hear the Proposition advanced the Reasons for it are so obvious to the very first Consideration we can make about it It will be likewise as amazing to me that the most ignorant should not conceive it after so plain a Reason is given them for it as I am now going to set down  To begin How are Children at first taught a Language that can hear Are they not taught by Sounds And what are those Sounds but Token and Signs to the Ear importing and signifying such and such a Thing If then there can be Signs made to the Eye agreed by the Party teaching  the Child that they signifie such and such a Thing will not the Eye of the Child convey them to the Mind as well as the Ear They are indeed different Marks to different Senses but both the one and the other do equally signifie the same Things or Notions according to the Will of the Teacher and consequently must have an equal Effect with the Person who is to be instructed For tho' the Manners signifying are different the Things signified are the same  For Example If after having invented an Alphabet upon the Fingers a Master always keeps Company with a Deaf Child and teaches it to call for whatsoever it wants by such Motions of the Fingers which if put down by Letters according to each invented Motion of each Finger would form in writing a Word of a Thing which it wanted might not he by these regular Motions teach it's Eye the same Notions of Things as Sounds do to the Ears of Children that Hear The Manner of Teaching the Alphabet by Fingers is plainly set down in the following Table  When the Deaf Child has Learn't by these Motions a good Stock of Words as Children that hear first learn by Sounds we may methinks call not improperly the Fingers of such a Dumb Infant its  Mouth  and the Eye of such a Deaf Child its  Ear  When he has learnt thus far he must be taught to  Write the Alphabet according as it was Adapted to the Motions of his Fingers As for Instance the five Vowels  a e i o u  by pointing to the top of the five Fingers and the other Letters  b c d c  by such other Place or Posture of a Finger as in the abovementioned Table is set forth or otherwise as shall be agreed upon When this is done the Marks B R E A D and so of all other Words Corresponding with such Fingers conveys thro' his Eyes unto his Head the same Notion  viz  the Thing signified as the Sound we give to those same Letters making the Word  Bread  do into our Heads thro' the Ears  This once done he may be easily taught to understand the Parts of Speech as the  Verb  the  Noun Pronoun  c and so by Rules of  Grammar  and  Syntax  to compound Ideas and connect his Words into a Language The Method of which since it is plainly set forth in Doctor  Wallis  's Letter to Mr  Beverly  I shall set it down by way of Extract that People in the same Circumstances with the Person we treat of and of the like Genius may not have their Talents lost for want of the like Assistance  When once a Deaf Person has learn't so far as to understand the common Discourse of others and to express his Mind tolerably well in Writing I see no room to doubt but that provided Nature has endowed him with  a proper Strength of Genius as other Men that hear he may become capable upon further Improvement of such further Knowledge as is attainable by Reading For I must here join with the Learned Doctor  Wallis  in asserting as to the present case before us that no Reason can be assigned why such a Deaf Person may not attain the understanding of a Language as  perfectly  as those that hear and with the same Learned Author I take upon me to lay down this Proposition as certain that allowing the Deaf Person the like Time and Exercise as to other Men is requisite in order to attain the Perfection of a Language and the Elegance of it he may understand as well and Write as good Language as other Men and abating only what doth depend upon Sound as Tones Cadencies and such Punctilio's no whit inferior to what he may attain to if he had his hearing as others have  An Extract from Dr  Wallis  concerning the Method of Teaching the  Deaf  and  Dumb  to Read  IT is most Natural as Children learn the Names of Things to furnish him by Degrees with a  Nomenclator  containing a Competent Number of Names of Things common and obvious to the Eye that you may shew the Thing answering to such a  Name and these digested under convenient Titles and placed under them in such convenient order in several Columns or other orderly Situation in the Paper as by their Position best to express to the Eye their Relation or Respect to one another As  Contraries  or  Correlatives  one against the other  Subordinates  or  Appurtenances  under their Principle which may serve as a kind of  Local Memory  Thus in one Paper under the Title  Mankind  may be placed not confusedly but in decent order Man Woman Child Boy Girl  In another Paper under the Title  Body  may be Written in like convenient Order Head Hair Skin Ear Face Forehead Eye Eyelid Eyebrow Cheek Nose Nostril Mouth Lip Chin Neck Throat Back Breasts Side rightside leftside Belly Shoulders Arm Elbow Wrist Hand Back Palm Finger Thumb Knuckle Nail Thigh Knee Leg Shin Calf Ancle Foot Heel Sole Toe  And when he hath Learned the Import of Words in each Paper let him write them in like Manner in distinct Leaves or Pages of a Book prepared for that purpose to confirm his Memory and to have recourse to it upon occasion  In a Third Paper you may give him the  Inward Parts  As Skull Brain Throat  Windpipe Gullet Stomach Guts Heart Lungs Liver Splene Kidney Bladder Urine Vein Blood Bone Marrow Flesh Fat  c  In another Paper under the Title  Beast  may be placed Horse Stonehorse Gelding Mare Colt Bull Ox Cow Calf Sheep Ram Wether Ewe Lamb Hog Boar Sow Pig Dog Mastiff Hound Greyhound Spaniel Bitch Whelp Puppy Hare Rabbet Cat Mouse Rat  c  Under the Title  Bird  or  Fowl  put Cock Capon Hen Chick Goose Gander Gosling Duck Drake Swan Crow Kite Lark  c  Under the Title  Fish  put Pike Eel Plaice Salmon Lobster Crab Oyster Crawfish  c  You may then put  Plants  or  Vegetables  under several Heads or Subdivisions of the same Head As Tree Root Body Bark Bough Leaf Fruit Oak Ash Appletree Peartree Vine  c  Fruit Apple Pear Plum Cherry Grape Nut Orange Lemon Flower Rose Tulip Gilofer Herb Weed Grass Corn Wheat Barly Rye Pea Bean  And the like of  Inanimates  as Heaven Sun Moon Star Element Earth Water Air Fire and under the Title Earth Clay Sand Gravel Stone Metal Gold Silver Brass Copper Iron Steel Lead Tin Pewter Glass Under the Title  Water  put Sea  Pond River Stream Under that of  Air  put Light Dark Mist Fog Cloud Wind Rain Hail Snow Thunder Lightning Rainbow Under that of  Fire  Coal Flame Smoak Soot Ashes  Under the Title  Clothes  put Woollen Cloth Stuff Linnen Holland Lawn Lockarum Silk Satin Velvet Hat Cap Band Doublet Breeches Coat Cloak Stocking Shoe Boot Shirt Petticoat Gown  c  Under the Title  House  put Wall Roof Door Window Casement Room  Under  Room  put Shop Hall Parlour DiningRoom Chamber Study Closet Kitchin Cellar Stable  c  And under each of these as distinct Heads the Furniture or Mensils belonging thereunto with Divisions and Subdivisions as there is occasion which I forbear to Mention that I be not too Prolix  And in like manner from Time to Time may be added more Collections or Clauses of Names or Words conveniently digested under distinct Heads and suitable Distributions to be written in distinct Leaves or Pages of his Book in such Order as may seem convenient  When he is furnished with a Competent Number of Names though not so many as I have mentioned It will be seasonable to teach him under the Titles Singular and  Plural The Formation of Plurals from Singulars by adding S or Es As Hand Hands Face Faces Fish Fishes  c  with some few irregulars as Man Men Woman Women Foot Feet Tooth Teeth Mouse Mice Lowse Lice Ox Oxen  c  Which except the irregulars will serve for Possessives to be afrer taught him which are formed by their Primitives by like Addition of S or Es except some few irregulars as My Mine Thy Thine Our Ours Your Yours His Her Hers Their Theirs  c  And in all those and other like Cases it will be proper first to shew him the Particulars and then the General Title  Then teach him in another Page or Paper the Particulars a an the this that these those  And the Pronouns I me my mine thou thee thy thine we us ourours ye you your yours he him his she her hers it it's they them their theirs who whom who's  Then under the Titles  Substantive Adjective  teach him to Connect these as my Hand your Head his Foot his Feet her Arm Arms our Hats their Shoes  John  's Coat  William  's Band  c  And in Order to furnish him with more Adjectives under the Title  Colours  you may place black white gray green blue yellow red  c  and having shewed the particulars let him know that these are  called Colours The like for taste and smell as sweet bitter soure stink  And for Hearing sound noise word  Then for touch or feeling hot warm cold cool wet moist dry hard soft tough brittle heavy light  c  From whence you may furnish him with more Examples of Adjectives with Substantives as white Bread brown Bread green Grass soft Cheese hard Cheese black Hat my black Hat  c  And then inverting the Order Substantive Adjective with the Verb Copulative between As Silver is white Gold is yellow Lead is heavy Wood is light Snow is white Ink is black Flesh is soft Bone is hard I am sick I am not well  c  which will begin to give him some Notion of  Syntax  In like Manner when Substantive and Substantive are so connected as Gold is a Metal a Rose is a Flower they are Men they are Women Horses are Beasts Geese are Fowls Larks are Birds  c  Then as those before relate to Quality you may give him some other Words relating to Quantity As long short broad narrow thick thin high tall low deep shallow great big small little much little

which the teacher according to his Discretion may take a convenient Season  As likewise the Time of the Day the Days of the Week the Days of the Month the Months of the Year and other Things relating to the  Almanack  which he will quickly be capable to understand if once Methodically shewn him  As likewise the Names and Situation of Places and Countries which are convenient for him to know which may be orderly written in his Book and shewed him in the Map of  London England Europe  the  World  c  But these may be done at leisure as likewise the practice of Arithmetick and other like Pieces of Learning  In the mean time after the Concord of Substantive and Adjective he is to be shewed by convenient Examples that of the  Nominative  and  Verb  As for Instance I go you see he sits they stand the fire burns the sun shines the wind blows the rain falls the water runs and the like with the Titles in the top Nominative Verb  After this under the Titles Nominative Verb Accusative give him Examples of Verbs Transitive as I see you you see me the fire burns the wood the Boy makes the fire the Cook roasts the meat the Butler lays the cloath we eat our dinner  Or even with a double Accusative as you teach me writing or to write  John  teacheth me to Dance  Thomas  tells me a Tale  c  After this you may teach him the Flexion or Comugation of the Verb or what is Equivalent thereunto for in our  English  Tongue each Verb hath but two Tenses the Present and the Preter two Participles the Active and the Passive all the rest is performed by Auxiliaries which Auxiliaries have no more Tenses than the other Verbs  Those Auxiliaries are do did will would shall should may might can could must ought to have had am be was And if by Examples you can insinuate the Significatation of these few Words you have taught him the whole Flexion of the Verb  And here it will be convenient once for all to write him out a full Paradigm of some one Verb suppose  to see  through all those Auxiliaries  The Verb itself hath but these four Words to be Learned see saw seeing seen save that after thou in the second Person Singular in both Tenses we add  est  and in the Third Person Singular in the Present Tense  eth  or  es  or instead thereof  st th s  and so in all Verbs  Then to the Auxiliaries do did will would shall should may might can could must ought to we join the Indefinite see And after have had am be was the Passive Particle seen and so for all other Verbs  But the Auxiliary  Am  or  Be  is somewhat irregular in a double Form  Am art is Plural are was wast was Plural were  Be beest be Plural be were wert were Plural were  Be am was being been  Which attended with the other Auxiliaries make us the whole Passive Voice  All Verbs without Exceptions in the Active Participle are formed by adding  ing  as see seeing teach teaching  c  The Preter Tense and the Participle are formed regularly by adding  ed  but are oft subject to Contractions and other irregularities sometime the same in both sometime  different and therefore it is convenient here to give a Table of Verbs especially the most usual for those  three  Cases which may at once teach their Signification and Formation as boil boiled rost rosted rosted bake baked baked  c  teach taught taught bring brought brought buy bought bought  c  see saw seen give gave given take took taken forsake forsooke forsaken write wrote written  c  with many more fit to be Learned  The Verbs being thus dispatched he is then to learn the Prepositions wherein lies the whole Regimen of the Noun For Diversity of Cases we have none the force of which is to be insinuated by convenient Examples suited to their different Significations As for Instance Of a piece  of  Bread a pint  of  Wine the colour  of  a Pot the colour  of  Gold a ring  of  Gold a cup  of  Silver the Mayor of  London  the longest  of  all  c  And in like Manner for off on upon to unto till until from at in within out without into out of about over under above below between among before behind after for by with through against concerning and by this time he will be pretty well inabled to understand a single Sentence  In the last Place he is in like Manner to be taught Conjunctions which serve to Connect not Words only but Sentences as and also likewise either or whether neither  nor if then why wherefore because therefore but though yet  c  and these Illustrated by convenient Examples in each case as  Because  I am cold  therefore  I go to the fire  that  I may be warm  for  it is cold weather  If  it were fair  then  it would be good walking but however  though  it rain  yet  I must go  because  I promised with other like Instances  And by this time his Book if well furnished with plenty of Words and those well digested under several Heads and in good Order and well recruited from time to time as new Words occur will serve him in the Nature of a  Dictionary  and  Grammar  And in case the Deaf Person be otherwise of a good Natural Capacity and the Teacher of a good Sagacity by this Method proceeding gradually step by step you may with diligence and due Application of Teacher and Learner in a Years Time or thereabouts perceive a greater Progress than you would expect and a good Foundation laid for further Instruction in matters of Religion and other Knowledge which may be taught by Books  It will be convenient all along to have Pen Ink and Paper ready at hand to write down in a Word what you signifie to him by Signs and cause him to write or shew how to write what he signifies by Signs which  way of signifying their mind by Signs Deaf Persons are often very good at And we must endeavour to learn their Language if I may so call it in order to teach them ours by shewing what Words answer to their Signs  'Twill be convenient also as you go along after some convenient Progress made to express in as plain Language as may be the Import of some of the Tables as for Instance  The Head is the highest part of the Body the Feet the lowest part the Face is the forepart of the Head the Forehead is over the Eyes the Cheeks are under the Eyes the Nose is between the Cheeks the Mouth is under the Nose and above the Chin  c  And such plain Discourse put into writing and particularly explained will teach him by degrees to understand plain Sentences and like Advantages a Sagacious Teacher may take as occasion offers itself from Time to Time  This Extract is mostly taken out of the Ingenious Dr  Wallis  and lying hid in that little Book which is but rarely Inquired after and too scarcely known dyed in a Manner with that Great Man And as he designed it for the General use of Mankind that Laboured under the Misfortune of losing those two valuable Talents of Hearing and  Speaking I thought it might not be amiss in the Life of so particular a Dumb Person as I am Writing to give them this small but particular Fragment of  Grammar  and  Syntax  It is Exactly adjusted to the  English  Tongue Because such are the Persons with whom the Dr had to deal and such the Persons whose Benefit alone I consult in this Treatise  One of the chief Persons who was taught by Dr  Wallis  was Mr  Alexander Popham  BrotherinLaw if I am not mistaken to the present Earl of  Oxford  and he was a very great Proficient in this way and tho' he was born Deaf and Dumb understood the Language so well as to give under his Hand many rare Indications of a Masterly Genius  The Uncle of his present  Sardinian  Majesty as I have been credibly informed had the want of the same Organs and yet was a perfect Statesman and wrote in five or six different Languages Elegantly well  Bishop  Burnet  in his Book of Travels tells us a Story almost incredible but tells it as a passage that deserves our belief It is concerning a young Lady at  Genoa  who was not only Deaf and Dumb but Blind too it seems into the Bargain and this Lady He assures us as a truth could by putting her Hand on her Sisters Mouth know every thing she said  But to Return back to  England  we have many rare Instances of our own Countrymen the Principal of whom I shall mention as their Names occur to my Memory Sir  John Gawdy  Sir  Thomas Knotcliff  Sir  Gostwick  Sir  Henry Lydall  and Mr  Richard Lyns  of  Oxford  were all of this Number and yet Men Eminent in their several Capacities for understanding many Authors and Expressing themselves in Writing with wonderful Facility  In  HattonGarden  there now Lives a Miracle of Wit and good Nature I mean the Daughter of Mr  Loggin  who tho' born Deaf and Dumb and she has a Brother who has the same Impediments yet writes her Mind down upon any Subject with such Acuteness as would Amaze Learned Men themselves and put many Students that have passed for Wits to a Blush to see themselves so far surpassed by a Woman amidst that deficiency of the common Organs If any body speaks a word distinctly this Lady will by observing narrowly the Motion of the speakers Lips pronounce the Word afterwards very Intelligibly  As there are a great many Families in  England  and  Ireland  that have several and some even have five or six Dumb Persons belonging to them And as a great many more believe it impossible for Persons born Deaf and Dumb to Write and Read and  have thence taken Occasion to say and assert that Mr  Campbell  could certainly speak I could never think it a Digression in the History of this Man's Life to set down the  Grammar  by which he himself was taught and which he has taught others Two of which Scholars of his are boys in this Town partly to confute the Slander made against him and partly for the help of others Dumb and Deaf whose Parents may by these Examples be Encouraged to get them taught  CHAP IV Young  Duncan Campbell  returns with his Mother to  Edinburg  The Earl of  Argyle's  overthrow The Ruin of Mr  Archibald Campbell  and his Death Young  Duncan's  practice in Prediction at  Edinburg  while yet a Boy  OUR Young Boy now between six and seven Years of Age half a  Highlander  and half a  Laplander  delighted in wearing a little Bonnet and Plaid thinking it looked very Manly in his Countrymen and his Father assoon as he was out of his Hanging Sleeves and left off his Boys Vest indulged him with that kind of Dress which is truly Antique and Heroick In this early part of his Nonage he was brought to  Edinburgh  by his Mother in Law where I my self grew afresh acquainted with her his Father being then but lately Dead Just after the Civil Commotion  and off and on have known him ever since and Conversed with him very frequently during that space of time which now is about three or four and thirty Years so that whatever I say concerning him in the future Pages I shall relate to the Reader from my own certain Knowledge which as I resolve to continue Anonymous may perhaps not have so much Weight and Authority as if I had prefix'd my Name to the Account Be that as it will there are hundreds of living Witnesses that will justifie each Action I relate and his own future Actions while he lives will procure belief and credit to the precedent ones which I am going to record so that if many do remain Infidels to my Relations and will not allow them Exact the fate of many as credible and more Important Historians than my self I can however venture to flatter my self that greater will be the Number of those who will have a Faith in my Writings than of those who will reject my Accounts as Incredible  Having just spoke of the Decease of Mr  Archibald Campbell  the Father of our Young  Duncan Campbell  It will not be amiss here to observe how true the Predictions of his  Lapland  Mother were which arose from Second Sight according to the Notices given by the Child's Father to its Grandfather in his Letter from  Lapland  even before it was born which snews that the Infant held this Second  Sighted Power or Occult faculty of Divination even by Inheritance  In the Year the Duke of  Monmouth  and the Earl of  Argyle  sailed out of the Ports of  Holland  without any Obstruction the Earl of  Argyle  in  May  with three Ships for  Scotland  and  Monmouth  in  June  with the same Number for  England  The Earl setting out first was also the first at Landing  Argyll  having attempted to Land in the North of  Scotland  and being disappointed by the Vigilance of the Bishop of the  Orcades  Landed in the West and Incamped at  Dunstafne  Castle in the Province of  Lorn  which had belonged to him He omitted nothing that might draw over to him all the Malecontents in the Kingdom whom he thought more Numerous than they afterwards appeared to be He dispersed about his Declarations wherein after protesting that he had taken up Arms only in Defence of Religion and the Laws against an injust Usurper so he Stiled King  James  the Second he invited all good Protestants and such  Scotch  as would assert the Liberty to join him against a Prince he said was got into the Throne to ruin the Reformation and to bring in Popery and Arbitrary Power Next he sent Letters to those he thought his Friends among whom was Mr  Archibald Campbell  who according to the vast deference payed by the  Scots  to their Chief joined him tho  in his heart of a quite different Principle to call them to his Assistance He Detached two of his Sons to make Inroades in the Neighbourhood and compel some by Threats others by mighty Promises to join him All his Contrivances could not raise him above three Thousand Men with whom he Incamped in the Isle of  Boot  where he was soon in a manner Besieged by the Earl of  Dunbarton  with the King's Forces and several other Bodies Commanded by the Duke of  Gordon  the Marquiss of  Athol  the Earl of  Arran  and other Great Men who came from all Parts to quench the Fire before it grew to a Head  The Earl of  Argyle  being obliged to quit a Post he could not make good went over into a Part of the Country of his own Name where having hastily Fortified a Castle called  Ellingrey  he put into it the Arms and Ammunition taken out of his Ships which lay at Anchor under the Cannon of a Fort he Erected near that Place There his Rout began for going out from the Castle with his Forces to make an Incursion one of his Parties was Defeated by the Marquiss of  Athol  who slew four hundred of his Men and Captain  Hamilton  who Attacked his Ships with some of the King's and took them without any resistance  The Earl of  Dunbarton  advancing towards him at the same time by long Marches while he Endeavoured to secure himself by Rivers surprized him passing the  Clyde  in the Village of  Killern  as he was Marching towards  Lenox Dunbarton  coming upon them at Night would have staid till the next Day to Attack the Rebels but they gave him not so much time for they passed the River in the Night in such Confusion that being overcome with fear they dispersed as soon as over  Argyle  could scarce rally so many as would make him a small Guard which was soon scattered again  Dunbarton  having passed the River and divided his Forces to pursue those that fled  Argyle  had taken Guides to Conduct him to  Galloway  but they mistaking the way and leading him into a Bog most of those that still followed him quitted their Horses every Man shifting for himself  Argyle  himself was making back alone towards the  Clyde  when two Resolute Servants belonging to an Officer in the King's Army meeting him tho' they knew him not bid him Surrender He fir'd at and missed them but they took better Aim and wounded him with a Pistol Ball Then the Earl drawing his two Pistols out of the Holsters quitted his Horse that was quite tired and took the River A Country Fellow who came with those two that had first assaulted him pursued  him with a Pistol in his Hand the Earl would have fired one of his but the flint failing he was dangerously wounded in the Head by the Peasant He discovered himself as he fell Senseless crying out  Unfortunate Argyle  This Nobleman how far soever he may be thought misled in Principle was certainly in his Person a very Brave and a very Gallant Hero They made hast to draw him out and bring him to himself after which being delivered up to the Officers the Erring unfortunate Great Man was Conducted to  Edingburgh  and there Beheaded  Many Gentlemen that followed the Fortunes of this Great Man tho' not in his Death they shared in all the other Calamities attending his overthrow They most of them fled into the remotest Isles and the obscurest corners of all  Scotland  Contented with the saving of their Lives they grew Exiles and Banished Men of their own making and Abdicated their Estates before they were known to be Forfeited because for fear of being informed against by the Common Fellows they Commanded they durst not appear to lay their Claims Of this Number was Mr  Archibald Campbell  and this new Disaster wounded him deep into the very Heart after so many late misadventures and sent him untimely to the Grave He perfectly pined away and wasted he was six Months dying Inch by Inch and the Difference between his least Breath and his way  of Breathing during all that time was only that he Expired with a greater Sigh than he ordinarily fetched every time when he drew his Breath  Every thing the  Lapland  Lady had Predicted so long before being thus come to pass we may the less admire at the wonders performed by her Son when we consider this faculty of Divination to be so derived to him from her and Grown as it were Hereditary  Our Young Prophet who had taught most of his little Companions to converse with him by Finger was the Head at every little Pastime and Game they Played at Marbles which he used to call Children's playing at Bowls yielded him mighty Diversion and he was so dexterous and Artist at shooting that little Alablaster Globe from between the end of his forefinger and the knuckle of his Thumb that he seldom missed hitting  Plum  as the Boys call it the Marble he aimed at tho' at the distance of two or three yards The Boys always when they played coveted to have him on their side and by hearing that he foretold other things used to consult him when they made their little Matches which were things of great Importance in their Thoughts who should get the Victory He used commonly to leave these trifles undecided but if ever he gave his Opinion in these trivial Affairs the Persons fared well by  their Consultation for his Judgment about them was like a petty Oracle and the end always Answered his Prediction But I would have my Reader imagin that tho' our  Duncan Campbell  was himself but a Boy He was not consulted only by Boys his Penetration and Insight into things of a high Nature got Air and being attested by credible Witnesses won him the Esteem of Persons of Mature Years and Discretion  If a Beautiful young Virgin languished for a Husband or a Widow's Mind was in Labour to have a second venture of Infants by another Spouse If a Housekeeper had lost any thing belonging to her Master still little  Duncan Campbell  was at Hand he was the Oracle to be applied to and the little Chalk'd Circle where he was diverting himself with his playfellows near the Cross at  Edinburgh  was frequented with as much solicitation and as much credit as the  Tripos  of  Apollo  was at  Delphos  in Ancient times  It was highly Entertaining to see a Young Blooming Beauty come and slily pick up the Boy from his Company carry him home with as much eagerness as she would her Gallant because she knew she should get the Name of her Gallant out of him before he went and bribe him with a Sugar Plumb to write down the Name of a Young  Scotch  Peer in a green Ribbon that her Mouth watered after  How often after he has been wallowing in the dust have I my self seen nice squeamish Widows help him up in their gilded Chariots and give him a Pleasant ride with them that he might tell them they should not long lie a lone little  Duncan Campbell  had as much business upon his Hands as the Parsons of all the Parishes in  Edinburgh  He commonly was consulted and named the Couples before the Minister joined them thus he grew a rare Customer to the Toyshop from whence he most an end received Fees and Rewards for his Advices If Lady  Betty  such a one was foretold that she should certainly have Beau such a one in Marriage then little  Duncan  was sure to have a HobbyHorse from the Toyshop as a Reward for the promised Fop If such a Widow that was ugly but very Rich was to be pushed hard for as she pretended tho' in reality easily won little  Duncan  upon ensuring her such a Captain or such a Lieutenant Colonel was sure to be presented from the same Child's Warehouse with a very handsome Drum and a Silver'd Trumpet  If a Seampstress had an Itching desire for a Parson she would upon the first Assurance of him give this little  Apollo  a Pastboard Temple or Church finely painted and a Ring of Bells into the Bargain from the same ToyOffice  If a Housekeeper lost any Plate the Thief was certain to be catched provided she took little Master into the StoreRoom and asked him the Question after she had given him his Belly full of SweetMeats  Neither were the Women only his consulters the Grave Merchants who were Anxious for many ventures at Sea applied to the Boy for his Opinion of their security and they looked upon his Opinion to be as safe as the Insurance Office for Ships If he but told them tho' the Ship was just set Sail and a Tempest rose just after on the Ocean that it would have a successful Voyage gain the Port designed and return home safe Laden with the Exchange of Traffick and Merchandize they dismissed all their Fears banish'd all their Cares set their Hearts at ease and safe in his Opinion enjoyed a Calm of Mind amidst a Storm of Weather  I my self knew one Count  Cog  an Eminent Gamester who was a Person so far from being of a Credulous Disposition that he was an unbeliever in several Points of Religion and the next Door to an Infidel Yet as much as he was a Stranger to Faith he was Mastered and overpowered so far in his incredulity by the Strange Events which he had seen come frequently to pass from the Predictions of this Child that he had commonly daily access to this Boy to learn his more adverse and more prosperous Hours of Gaming At  first indeed he would try when the Child foretold him his ill Fortune whether it would prove true and relying upon the mere hazard and turn of the Dye he had always as he observed a run of ill Luck on those forbidden Days as he never fail'd of good if he chose the fortunate Hours directed by the Boy One time above all the rest just before he was departing from  Edinburgh  and when the Season of Gaming was almost over most Persons of Wealth and Distinction withdrawing for Pleasure to their Seats in the Country he came to young  Duncan Campbell  to consult and was extremely solicitous to know how happily or unluckily he should end that  Term  as we may call it of the Gamesters  weighty Business viz Play  there being a long  Vacation  likely to ensue when the gaming Table would be empty and the Box and Dice lie idle and cease to rattle The Boy encourag'd him so well with his Predictions on this occasion that Count  Cog  went to the Toyshop brought him from thence a very fine  Ivory T Totum  as Children call  pretty Set of painted and guilded little Nine pins and a Bowl and a large Bag of Marbles and Alloys And what do you think the Gamester got by this little Present and the Prediction of the Boy Why without telling the least title of Falshood within the space of the last Week's Play the Gains of Count  Cog  really amounted to no less than  Twenty Thousand Pounds Sterling neat Money  Having mention'd these Persons of so many different Professions by borrow'd Names and perhaps in a manner seemingly Ludicrous I would not have my Reader from hence take occasion of looking upon my account as fabulous If I was not to make use of borrow'd Names but to tell the real Characters and Names of the Persons I should do injury to these old Friends of his who first gave Credit to our young Seer while I am endeavouring to gain him the Credit and Esteem of new ones in whose way it has not yet happen'd to consult him For many Persons are very willing to ask such Questions as the foregoing ones but few or none willing to have the Publick told they ask'd them tho' they succeeded in their Wish and were amply satisfy'd in their Curiosity I have represented them perhaps in a ludicrous manner because tho' they are misterious Actions they are still the Actions of a  and as the Rewards he receiv'd for his Advices did really and truly consist of such Toys as I mentioned so could they not be treated or in a more serious manner without the Author's incurring a magiserial Air of Pedantry and shewing a Mind as it were of being mighty Grave and Sententious about Trifles There are however some thing of greater Weight and Importance  by him in a more advanc'd Stage of Life  which will be deliver'd to the Publick with that Exactitude and Gravity which becomes them and in some of those Relations the Names of some Persons that are concerned shall be printed because it will not at all be injurious to them or because I have their leave and they are still living to testify what I shall relate  In the mean time as the greatest part of his  Nonage  was spent in predicting almost innumerable things which are all however reducible to the  general Heads  abovemention'd I will not tire the Reader with any particulars but instead of doing that before I come to shew his Power of Divination in the more active Parts of his Life and when after removing from  Edinburgh  to  London  he at last made it his publick Profession I shall account how such Divinations may be made and divert the Reader with many rare Examples taken from several faithful and undoubted Historians of Persons who have done the like before him some in  one way  and some in  another  tho' in this he seems to be peculiar and to be if I may be allow'd the Expression a  Species by himself  alone in the  Talent  of  Prediction  that he has  colleded  within his own  individual  Capacity  all  the Methods which others  severally  us'd and with which they were  differently  and  singly  gifted in their several ways of foreseeing and foretelling  This Art of Prediction is not attainable any otherwise than by these Three Ways first it is done by the Company of Familiar Spirits and Genii which are of Two Sorts some Good and some Bad who tell the gifted Person the things of which he informs other People  dly  It is perform'd by the Second Sight which is very various and differs in most of the Possessors it being but a very little in some very extensive and constant in others beginning with some in their Infancy and leaving them before they come to Years happening to others in a middle Age to others again in an old Age that never had it before and lasting only for a term of Years and now and then for a very short period of Time and in some intermitting like fits as it were of Vision that leave them for a time and then return to be as strong in them as ever and it being in a manner Hereditary to some Families whose Children have it from their Infancy without intermission to a great old Age and even to the time of their Death which they often foretell before it comes to pass to a Day nay even to an Hour  dly  It is attain'd by the diligent Study of the lawful Part of the Art of Magick  Before I give the Reader an account as I shall do in Three distinct Discourses  st  concerning the Intercourse which Familiar Spirits  viz  the good and bad  Genii  have had  and continue to have to a great degree with some select Parts of Mankind  dly  concerning the wonderful and almost miraculous Power of a Second Sight with which many beyond all controversy have been extraordinarily but visibly gifted and  dly  concerning the pitch of Perfection to which the magick Science has been carry'd and promoted by some adepts in that misterious Art I will premise a few particulars about the  Genii  which attended our little  Duncan Campbell  and about the Second Sight which he had when yet a Child and when we may much more easily believe that the Wonders he perform'd and wrote of must have been rather brought about by the intervention of such  Genii  and the mediation of such a Sight than that he could have invented such Fables concerning them and compassed such Predictions as seem'd to want their assistance by the mere dint of a Child's Capacity  One Day I remember when he was about Nine Years of Age going early to the House where he and his Mother liv'd and it being before his Mother was stirring I went into little  Duncan Campbell  's Room to divert myself with him I found him sitting up in his Bed with his Eyes broad open but as motionless as if he had been asleep or even if it had not been for a lively beautiful Colour which the little pretty fair Silver Hair'd Boy always had in his Cheeks as if he had  been quite dead he did not seem so much as to breath the Eylids of him were so fix'd and immovable that the Eylashes did not so much as once shake which the least Motion imaginable must agitate not to say that he was like a Person in an  Exstacy  he was at least in what we commonly call a  Brown Study  to the highest degree and for the largest space of time I ever knew I who had been frequently inform'd by People who have been present at the Operations of Second Sighted Persons that at the Sight of a Vision the Eylids of the Person are erected and the Eyes continue staring till the Object vanishes I Isay sate myself softly down on his Bedside and with a quiet Amazement observ'd him avoiding diligently any Motion that might give him the least disturbance or cause in him any avocation or distraction of Mind from the Business he was so intent upon I remark'd that he held his Head  sideways  with his Mouth wide open and in a  list'ning  Posture and  that  after so lively a manner as at first general thought made me forget his Deafness and plainly imagin he heard something till the Second thought of Reflection brought into my Mind the Misfortune that shut up all Passage for any Sound through his Ears After a stedfast Gaze which lasted about Seven Minutes he smiled and stretch'd his Arms as one recovering from a Fit of Indolence and rubb'd his Eyes then turning  towards me he made the Sign of a Salute and hinted to me upon his Fingers his desire for Pen Ink and Paper which I reach'd him from a little Desk that stood at his Bed'sfeet  Placing the Paper upon his Knees he wrote me the following Lines which together with my Answers I preserve by me for their Rarity to this very Day and which I have transcribed Word for Word as they form a little Series of Dialogue  Duncan Campbell  I am sorry I cant stay with you but I shall see my pretty Youth and my Lamb by and by in the Fields near a little Coppice or Grove where I go often to play with them and I would not lose their Company for the whole World for they and I are mighty familiar together and the Boy tells me every thing that gets me my Reputation among the Ladies and Nobility and you must keep it Secret  My Question  I will be sure to keep it secret But how do you know you are to meet them there to Day Did the little Boy appoint you  Duncan Campbell  Yess he did and signify'd that he had several things to predict to me concerning People that he foreknew would come to me the Week following to ask me Questions  My Question  But what was you staring at when I came in  Duncan Campbell  Why at that little Boy  that goes along with the Lamb I speak of and 'twas  then  he made me the Appointment  My Question  How does he do it Does he write  Duncan Campbell  No he writes sometimes but oftner he speaks with his Fingers and mighty swift No Man can do it so quick or write half so soon he has a little Bell in his Hand like that which my Mother makes me a Sign to shake when she wants the Servants with That he tickles my Brain strangely and gives me an incredible Delight of  feeling  in the  inside  of my Head he usually wakes me with it in the Morning when he comes to make me an Appointment I fancy 'tis what you call  Hearing  which makes me mighty desirous I could  hear  in your way 'tis sweeter to the feeling methinks than any thing is to the tast It is just as if my Head was tickled to Death as my Nurse used to tickle my Sides but 'tis a different feeling for it makes things like little Strings tremble in my Temples and behind my Ears Now I remember I will tell you what 'tis like that makes me believe 'tis like your  Hearing  and that strange thing which you that can speak call Sound or Noise Because when I was at Church with my Mother who told me the Bells could be heard ringing a Mile off As I was kneeling on the Bench and leaning over the top of the Pew and gnawing the Board every time the Man pull'd the Rope I thought all my Head beat as if it would come to Pieces but yet it pleased me  methought rather than pain'd me and I would be always gnawing the Board when the Man pull'd the Rope and I told my Mother the reason The feeling of that was something like the little Bell but only  that  made my Head  throb  as if it would break and  this tickles  me and makes as it were little Strings on the back of my Ears dance and tremble like any thing is not that like your way of  Hearing  If it be it is a sweet thing to hearIt is more pleasant than to see the finest Colours in the Worldit is something like being tickled in the Nose with a Feather till one Sneezes or like the feeling after one strikes the Leg when it has been numb or asleep only with this difference that those Two ways give a Pain and the other a Pleasure I remember too when I had a great Cold for about Two Months I had a feeling something like it but that was blunt dull confus'd and troublesome Is not this like what you call  Hearing  My Question  It is the finest kind of hearing my Dear it is what we call Musick But what sort of a Boy is that that meets you And what sort of a Lamb  Duncan Campbell  Oh tho' they are like other Boys and other Lambs which you see they are a Thousand Times prettier and finer you never saw such a Boy nor such a Lamb in your Lifetime  My Question  How big is he As big as you are And what sort of a Boy is he  Duncan Campbell  He is a little little pretty Boy about as tall as my Knee his Face is as white as Snow and so are his little Hands his Cheeks are as red as a Cherry and so are his Lips and when he Breaths it makes the Air more perfum'd than my Mother's sweet Baggs that she puts among the Linnen he has got a Crown of Roses Cowslips and other Flowers upon his Head such as the Maids gather in  May  his Hair is like fine Silver Threads and shine like the Beams of the Sun he wears a loose Veil down to his Feet that is as Blue as the Sky in a clear Day and embroider'd with Spangles that look like the brightest Stars in the Night he carries a Silver Bell in one Hand and a Book and Pencil in the other and he and the little Lamb will dance and leap about me in a Ring as high as my Head the Lamb has got a little Silver Collar with Nine little Bells upon it and every little piece of Wooll upon its Back that is as white Milk is tied up all round it in Puffs like a little Misses Hair with Ribbons of all Colours and round its Head too are little Roses and Violets stuck very thick into the Wooll that grows upon its Forehead and behind and between its Ears in the Shape of a Diadem They first meet me dancing thus and after they have danc'd sometime the little Boy writes down wonderful things in his Book which I write down in mine then they dance again till he rings his Bell and then they are gone  all of a sudden I know not where but I feel the tickling in the inside of my Head caus'd by the Bell less and less 'til I don't feel it at all and then I go home read over my Lesson in my Book and when I have it by heart I burn the written Leaves according as the little Boy bids me or he would let me have no more But I hear the little Bell again the little Boy is angry with me he  pull'd  me  Twice  by the  Ear  and I would not displease him for any thing so I must get up and go immediately to the Joy and Delight of my Life  I told him he might if he would promise me to tell me further another time he said he would if I would keep it secret I told him I would and so we parted tho' just before he went he said he  smelt  some Venison and he was sure they would shortly have some for Dinner and nothing was so sure as that my Man had my Orders to bring a Side of Venison to me the next Day to Mrs  Campbell  's for I had been hunting and came thither from the death of a Deer that Morning and intended as usual to make a stay there for Two or Three Days  There are I know many Men of severe Principles and who are more Strict Grave and Formal in their manner of thinking than they are Wise who will be apt to judge of these relations as things merely Fabulous and Chimerical and not contented with being disbelievers by themselves will labour  to insinuate into others this pernicious Notion that it is a sign of Infirmity and Weakness in the Head to yield them Credit But tho' I could easily argue these  Sir Gravities  down tho' a Sentence or Two would do their Business put them beyond the Power of replying and strike them Dumb yet do I thing it not worth my while their greatest and most wonted Objection against these  Eudemons  and  Kakodemons  being that it arises all from the work of fancy in Persons of a melancholick Blood If we consider the nature of this Child's Dialogue with me will it not be more whimsically strange and miraculous to say that a Child of Nine Years old had only a fancy of such things as these of which it had never heard any Body give an account and that it could by the mere strength of Imagination predict such things as really after came to pass than it is when it does so strangely predict things to believe the Child does it in the  manner  itself owns it does which is by the intervention of a good  Demon  or a happy Genius Departing therefore from these singular wise Mens Opinions who will believe nothing Excellent can happen to others which it has not been their Lot to enjoy a share of I shall take my farewel hastily of them without loosing my own time or theirs in the Words of the ingenious and learned Monsieur  le Clerc Acerbos homines non Moror Indignos quippe qui haec studia  tractent aut quorum Judicii ulla ratio habeetur  I shall rather see how far these things have lain open to the Eyes of and been explain'd by the ancient Sages I will relate who among them were happy in their  Genii  and who among the Moderns whose Examples may be Authorities for our Belief I will set down as clearly as I can what Perception Men have had of  Genii  or Spirits by the sense of seeing what by the sense of hearing what by the sense of feeling touching or tasting and in fine what Perception others have had of these  Genii  by all the Senses what by Dreams and what by Magick a thing rarely to be met with at once in any single Man and which seems particular to the Child who was the Subject of our last little historical Account When I have brought Examples and the Opinions of wise Philosophers and the Evidence of undeniable Witnesses which one would think sufficient to evince Persons of the Commerce Men have with Spirits if they were not past all sense of Conviction I shall not so much to corroborate what I say as to shame some Wiseacres who would by their frail Reason scan all things and pretend to solve the Mysteries ascribed to Spirits as Facts merely natural and who would banish from the Thoughts of Men all belief of Spirits whatsoever I shall I say in order to put to shame these Wiseacres  if they have any Shame left produce the Opinions of the Fathers as Divines shew the Doctrines of Spirits in general to be consistent with Christianity that they are deliver'd in the Scripture and by Christian Tradition in which if they will not acquiesce I shall leave them to the Labyrinth of their own wild Opinions which in the end will so perplex their Judgments of things that they will be never able to extricate themselves and these different Heads will be the Subject of the Chapter ensuing and will or I am greatly mistaken form both an instructive edifying and entertaining Discourse for a Reader really and truly intelligent and that has a good taste and relish for sublime things  CHAP V An Argument proving the Perception which Men have and have had by all the Senses as seeing hearing  c  of  Demons    Genii  or familiar Spirits  IT is said in the Ninth Book of the Morals of  Aristotle  it is better to come at the probable Knowledge of some things above us in the Heavens than to be capable of giving many Demonstrations relating to things here below This is no doubt an admirable Proposition and speaks the lofty aims  of that sublime Mind from whence it proceeded Among all the disquisitions in this kind none seem to me more excellent than those which treat concerning the  Genii  that attend upon Men and guide them in the Actions of Life A Genius or  Demon  of the good Kind is a sort of mediate Being between Humane and Divine which gives the Mind of Man a pleasant Conjunction with Angelick and Celestial Faculties and brings down to Earth a faint participation of the Joys of Heaven That there have been such fortunate Attendants upon wise Men we have many rare Instances They have been ascribed to  Socrates Aristotle Plotinus Porphyrius Jamblicus Chicus Scaliger  and  Cardan  The most celebrated of all these Ancients was  Socrates  and as for his having a Genius or  Demon  we have the Testimonies of  Plato Xenophon  and  Antisthenes  his Contemporaries confirm'd by  Laertius Plutarch Maximus Tyrius Dion Chrysostonius Cicero Apuleius Ficinus  and others many of the Moderns besides  Tertullian Origen Clemens Alexandrinus Austin  and others and  Socrates  himself in  Plato  's  Theage  says  By some Divine Lot I have a certain  Demon  which has followed me from my Childhood as an Oracle  and in the same place intimates that the way he gain'd his Instruction was by hearing the  Demon  's Voice Nothing is certainly so easy as for Men to be able to contradict things tho' never  so well attested with such an air of Truth as to make the Truth of the History doubted by others as well as themselves where no demonstrative Proof can be brought to convince them This has been the easy Task of those who object against the  Demon  of  Socrates  but when no demonstrative Proof is to be had on either side does not Wisdom incline us to lean to the most Probable Let us then consider whether the Evidences are not more credible and Witnesses of such a thing are not Persons of more Authority than  these  Men are who vouchsafe to give  no  reason but their own  Incredulity  for maintaining the contrary and whether  those  therefore by the right rule of judging ought not much sooner than  these  to gain over our Assent to their Assertions  We will however laying aside the Histories of those ancient Times the sense whereof by various Readings and Interpretations being put upon the Words is render'd obscure and almost unintelligible descend to more modern Relations the Facts whereof shall be placed beyond doubt by reason of the Evidences we will bring to attest them and shall consequently prove the perception Men have of Spirits or  Genii  by every Sense  SECTION I  We will first begin as to the perception of Spirits by the Sight  Mr  Glanvil  in his Collections of Relations for proving Apparitions Spirits  c  tells us of an  Irish  Man that had like to have been carried away by Spirits and of the Ghost of a Man who had been Seven Years dead that brought a Medicine to his Bedside  The Relation is thus  A Gentleman in  Ireland  near to the Earl of  Orrery  's sending his Butler one Afternoon to buy Cards as he pass'd a Field to his Wonder he espy'd a Company of People sitting round a Table with a deal of good Cheer before them in the mid'st of the Field And he going up towards them they all arose and saluted him and desir'd him to sit down with them but one of them wisper'd these Words in his Ear  Do nothing this Company invites you to  Hereupon he refus'd to sit down at the Table and immediately Table and all that belong'd to it were gone and the Company are now dancing and playing upon Musical Instruments And the Butler being desir'd to join himself with them but he refusing this also they all fall to Work and he not being to be prevail'd with to accompany them in working any more than in feasting or dancing they all disappear'd and the Butler is now alone but instead of going forwards home he returns as fast as he could drive in a great Consternation and was no sooner enter'd his Master's Door but he fell down and lay sometime Senseless but coming  again to himself he related to his Master what had passed  The Night following there comes one of his Company to his Bedside and tells him  that if he offered to stir out of the Doors the next Day he would be carried away  Hereupon he kept within but towards the Evening having need to make Water he adventur'd to put one Foot over the Threshold several standing by which he had no sooner done but they espy'd a Rope cast about his Middle and the poor Man was hurried away with great Swiftness they following him as fast as they could but could not overtake him at length they espy'd an Horseman coming towards him and made Signs to him to stop the Man whom he saw coming near him and both ends of the Rope but nobody drawing when they met he laid hold of one end of the Rope and immediately had a smart blow given him over his Arm with the other end but by this means the Man was stopp'd and the Horseman brought him back with him  The Earl of  Orrery  hearing of these strange Passages sent to the Master to desire him to send this Man to his House which he accordingly did and the Morning following or quickly after he told the Earl that his  Spectre  had been with him again and assur'd him that that Day he should most certainly be carry'd away and that no Endeavors should  avail to the saving of him upon this he was kept in a large Room with a considerable Number of Persons to guard him among whom was the famous Stroaker Mr  Greatrix  who was a Neighbour There were beside other Persons of Quality Two Bishops in the House at the same time who were consulted concerning the making use of a Medicine the  Spectre  or  Ghost  prescrib'd of which mention will be made anon but they determin'd on the Negative  Till part of the Afternoon was spent all was quiet but at length he was perceiv'd to rise from the Ground whereupon Mr  Greatrix  and another lusty Man clapt their Arms over his Shoulders one of them before him and the other behind and weigh'd him down with all their Strength but he was forcibly taken up from them and they were too weak to keep their hold and for a considerable time he was carry'd into the Air to and fro over their Heads several of the Company still running under him to prevent his receiving hurt if he should fall at length he fell and was caught before he came to the Ground and had by that means no hurt  All being quiet till Bedtime  My LORD  order'd Two of his Servants to lie with him and the next Morning he told his Lordship that his  Spectre  was again with him and brought a wooden Dish with grey Liquor in it and bid him drink it off at the first sight  of the  Spectre  he said he endeavour'd to awake his Bedfellows but it told him that that Endeavour should be in vain and that he had no cause to fear him he being his Friend and he that at first gave him the good Advice in the Field which had he not followed he had been before now perfectly in the Power of the Company he saw there he added that he concluded it was impossible but that he should have been carried away the Day before there being so strong a Combination against him but now he could assure him there would be more Attempts of that nature but he being troubled with Two sorts of sad Fits he had brought that Liquor to cure him of them and bid him drink it he peremptorily refusing the  Spectre  was angry and upbraided him with great disingenuity but told him however he had a kindness for him and that if he would take  Plantane Juice  he should be well of one sort of Fits but he should carry the other to his Grave the poor Man having by this somewhat recover'd himself ask'd the  Spectre  whether by the juice of  Plantane  he meant that of the  Leaves  or  Roots  It reply'd the  Roots  Then it ask'd him whether he did not know him He answer'd no it reply'd I am such a one The Man answer'd he had been long dead I have been dead said the  Spectre  or  Ghost  Seven Years and you know that I liv'd a loose Life and ever since I have  been hurried up and down in a restless Condition with the Company you saw and shall be to the Day of Judgment Then he proceeded to tell him that had he acknowledg'd God in his ways he had not suffer'd such severe things by their Means and further said you never pray'd to God that Day before you met with this Company in the Fields  This Relation was sent to Dr  Henry More  by Mr  E Fowler  who said Mr  Greatrix  told it several Persons The Lord  Orrery  also own'd the Truth of it and Mr  Greatrix  told it to Dr  Henry More  himself who particularly inquired of Mr  Greatrix  about the Man's being carried up into the Air above Mens Heads in the Room and he did expresly affirm that he was an Eyewitness thereof  A Vision which happened to the ingenious and learned Dr  Donne  may not improperly be here inserted Mr  Isaac Walton  writing the Life of the said Doctor tells us that the Doctor and his Wife living with Sir  Robert Drury  who gave them a free Entertainment at his House in  Drurylane  it happen'd that the Lord  Haye  was by King  James  sent in an Ambassy to the  French  King  Henry  IV whom Sir  Robert  resolv'd to Accompany and ingag'd Dr  Donne  to go with them whose Wife was then with Child at Sir  Robert  's House Two Days after their arrival at  Paris  Dr  Donne  was left alone in that Room in  which Sir  Robert  and he and some other Friends had dined together To this Place Sir  Robert  return'd within half an Hour and as he left so he found Dr  Donne  alone but in such an Extasy and so alter'd in his Looks as amaz'd Sir  Robert  to behold him insomuch that he earnestly desir'd Dr  Donne  to declare what had befallen him in the short time of his Absence To which Dr  Donne  was not able to make a  present  Answer but after a  long  and  perplex'd Pause  did at last say I have  seen a dreadful Vision  since I saw you I have  seen  my  dear Wife  pass Twice by me through this Room with her  Hair hanging  about her  Shoulders  and a  dead Child  in  her Arms  this I have seen since I saw you To which Sir  Robert  reply'd  sure  Sir you have  slept  since I saw you and this is the Result of some  melancholy Dream  which I desire you to  forget  for you are now  awake  To which Dr  Donne  's reply was I cannot be  surer  that I  now live  than that I have  not slept  since I saw you and am as  sure  at her  Second appearing she  stop'd and  look'd  me in the  Face  and  vanish'd Rest  and  Sleep  had not  alter'd  Dr  Donne  's  Opinion  the  next Day  for he then affirm'd  this Vision  with a  more deliberate  and  so con+firm'd  a  Confidence  that he  inclin'd  Sir  Robert  to a  faint Belief  that the  Vision  was  true  who immediately  sent  a Servant to  Drury  House with a Charge to hasten back  and bring him Word whether Mrs  Donne  were alive and if alive what  Condition  she was in as to her Health The Twelfth Day the Messenger return'd with this Account That he found and left Mrs  Donne  very  Sad  and  Sick  in Bed and that after a  long  and  dangerous  Labour she had been deliver'd of a  dead  Child and upon  Examination  the Abortion prov'd to be the  same Day  and about the  very Hour  that Dr  Donne  affirm'd  he saw her  pass by in his Chamber Mr  Walton  adds this as a Relation which will beget some Wonder and well it may for most of our World are at present possess'd with an Opinion that Visions and Miracles are ceas'd and though 'tis most certain that Two Lutes being both Strung and tuned to an equal Pitch and then one play'd upon the other that is not touched being laid upon the Table at a fit distance will like an Eccho to a Trumpet warble a faint audible Harmony in answer to the same Tune yet many will not believe that there is any such thing as a Sympathy with Soals  c  SECTION II  I shall next relate some little Histories to shew what  Perception  Men have had of  Spirits  by the  Sense  of  hearing  For as  Wierus  says Spirits  appear  sometimes  invisibly  so that only a Sound Voice or Noise is perceived by Men  viz  a Stroke Knocking Whistling Sneezing Groaning Lamenting or clapping of the Hands to make Men attent to Enquire or Answer  In  Luther  's  Colloquia Mensalia c  set forth in  Latin  at  Francfort Anno  it being a different Collection from that of  Aurifaber  which is translated from  High Dutch  into  English  We have the following Relation  It happen'd in  Prussia  that as a certain Boy was Born there presently came to him a  Genius  or what you please to call it for I leave it to Mens Judgments who had so faithful a Care of the Infant that there was no need either of Mother or Servant and as he grew up he had a like care of him He went to School with him but  so  that he could never be  seen  either by  himself  or any  others  in  all  his Life Afterwards he travelled into  Italy  he accompanied him and whensoever any Evil was like to happen to him either on the Road or in the Inn he was perceiv'd to foretel it by some Touch or Stroke he drew off his Boots as a Servant if he turn'd his Journey another way he continued with him having the same care of him in foretelling Evil at length he was made a  Canon  and as on a time he was sitting and feasting with his Friends in much Jollity a vehement  Stroke was struck on a sudden on the Table so that they were all terrify'd presently the  Canon  said to his Friends be not afraid some great Evil hangs over my Head The next Day he fell into a great Fever and the Fit continued on him for Three whole Days till he died miserably  Captain  Henry Bell  in his Narrative prefix'd to  Luther  's Table printed in  English Anno  having acquainted us how the  German  Copy printed of it had been discover'd under Ground where it had lain hid Fifty Two Years that Edition having been supprest by an Edict of the Emperor  Rudolphus  II so that it was Death for any Person to keep a Copy thereof and having told us that  Casparus Van Spar  a  German  Gentleman with whom he was familiarly acquainted while he negotiated Affairs in  Germany  for King  James  I was the Person that discover'd it  Anno  and transmitted it into  England  to him and earnestly desired him to Translate the said Book into  English  says he accordingly set upon the Translation of it many times but was always hinder'd from Proceeding in it by some intervening Business About Six Weeks after he had receiv'd the Copy being in Bed with his Wife one Night between Twelve and One of the Clock she being asleep but himself awake there appear'd to him an  ancient Man  standing at his Bed'sside array'd all  in White  having a  long  and  broad white Beard  hanging down to his  Girdle  who taking him by his  right Ear  said thus to him Sirrah Will you not take time to Translate that Book which is sent unto you out of  Germany  I will shortly provide for you both  Place  and  Time  to do it and then he  vanish'd  Hereupon being much affrighted he fell into an extream  Sweat  so that his Wife awaking and finding him all over  Wet  she ask'd him what he ail'd He told her what he had  seen and heard  but he never regarded Visions nor Dreams and so the same fell out of his Mind But a Fortnight after being on a Sunday at his Lodging in  King'sstreet Westminster  at Dinner with his Wife Two Messengers were sent from the whole Counselboard with a Warrant to carry him to the  Gatehouse Westminster  there to be kept till further Order from the Lords of the Council upon which Warrant he was kept there  Ten  whole Years close Prisoner where he spent  Five Years  of it in  Translating  the  said Book  having  good Cause  to be mindful of the  old Man's saying  I will shortly provide for you both  Place  and  Time  to  Translate  it  Tho' the Perception of Spirits chiefly affects the  hearing  and  seeing  Faculties yet are not the  other Senses  without some  Participation  of these  genial Objects  whether  Good  or  Evil  for as St  Austin  says the evil Work of the Devil creeps through all  the Passages of the Senses he presents himself in Figures applies himself to Colours adheres to Sounds introduces Odors infuses himself in Savors and fills all the Passages of Intelligence sometimes cruelly tormenting with Grief and Fear sometimes sportingly diverting Man or taunting with Mocks and on the other Hand as the learned  Wabter Hilton  a great Master of contemplative Life in his Scale of Perfection sets forth that Appearances or Representations to the corporeal Senses may be both  Good  and  Evil  But before I conclude upon this Head to give still more Weight and Authority to the Perception Men have had of these  Genii  both by the Senses of  hearing  and  seeing  I will relate Two very remarkable Fragments of History of this kind told us by Persons who demand our Credit and done within the Memory of our Grandfathers and Fathers  The first is concerning that Duke of  Buckingham  who was stab'd by  Felton August  the Twenty Third  Mr  Lilly  the  Astrologer  in his Book entituled  Monarchy or no Monarchy in  England printed in Quarto Having mentioned the Duke of  Buckingham  writes as follows  Since I am upon the Death of  Buckingham  I shall relate a true Story of his being  admonished often of the Death he should die in this Manner  An aged Gentleman one  Parker  as I now remember having formerly belonged unto the Duke or of great Acquaintance with the Duke's Father and now retired had a  Demon  appeared several Times to him in the shape of Sir  George Villiers  the Duke's Father This  Demon  walk'd many Times in  Parker  's Bedchamber without any Action of Terror Noise Hurt or Speech but at last one Night broke out in these Words Mr  Parker  I know you loved me formerly and my Son  George  at this Time very well I would have you go from me you know me very well to be his Father old Sir  George Villiers  of  Leicestershire  and acquaint him with  these  and  these Particulars c  and that he  above all refrain  the  Council  and  Company  of  such  and  such  whom he then  nominated  or else he will come to  Destruction  and that  suddenly Parker  though a very  discreet  Man partly imagined himself in a Dream all this Time and being unwilling to proceed upon no better Grounds forbore addressing himself to the Duke for he conceived if he should acquaint the Duke with the Words of his Father and the manner of his appearance to him such Apparitions being not usual he should be  laugh'd at  and thought to  Doat  in regard he was  aged  Some few Nights past without further  Trouble to the old Man but not very many Nights after old Sir  George Villiers  appeared again walk'd quick and furiously in the Room seem'd angry with  Parker  and at last said Mr  Parker  I thought you had been my Friend so much and loved my Son  George  so well that you would have acquainted him with what I desired but I know you have not done it by all the Friendship that ever was betwixt  you  and  me  and the great  Respect  you bear  my Son  I  desire  you to  deliver  what I formerly commanded you to  my Son  The old Man seeing himself thus sollicited promised the  Demon  he would but first argued it thus that the Duke was not  easy  to be  spoken  withal and that  he  would account  him  a  vain Man  to  come  with  such  a  Message  from the  Dead  nor did he conceive the  Duke  would give  any Credit  to him to which the  Demon  thus answer'd If he will  not  believe you have this Discourse from me tell him of  such  a  Secret  and nam'd it which he knows  none  in the World ever knew but  myself  and  him  Mr  Parker  being now  well satisfy'd  that he was  not  asleep and that the  Apparition  was  not  a  vain Delusion  took a fit Opportunity and seriously acquainted the  Duke  with his  Father's Words  and the  manner  of his  Apparition  The  Duke laugh'd heartily  at the Relation which put old  Parker  to a stand but at last he assumed Courage and told the Duke that he acquainted  his Father's Ghost with what he found now to be true  viz Scorn  and  Derision  but my Lord says he your Father bid me acquaint you by  this Token  and he said it was  such  as none in the World but your  Two selves  did yet know  hereat  the Duke was  amazed  and much astonished but took  no  Warning or Notice thereof keeping the  same Company  still advising with  such Counsellors  and performing  such Actions  as his Father by  Parker  countermanded shortly after old Sir  George Villiers  in a very quiet but sorrowful Posture appears again to  Parker  and said Mr  Parker  I know you deliver'd my Words to  George  my Son I thank you for so doing but he slighted them and now I only request this more at your Hands that once again you repair to my Son and tell him that if he will not amend and follow the Counsel I have given him this Knife or Dagger and with that he pull'd a Knife or Dagger from under his Gown shall end him and do you Mr  Parker  set your House in order for you shall die at such a Time Mr  Parker  once more engag'd though very unwillingly to acquaint the Duke with the last Message and so did but the Duke desir'd him to trouble him no further with such Messages and Dreams and told him he perceiv'd he was now an old Man and doted and within a  Month after  meeting Mr  Parker  on  Lambeth  Bridge said now Mr  Parker  what  say you of your Dream Who only return'd Sir I  wish  it may  never  have  success c  But within  Six Weeks  after he was stab'd with a  Knife  according to his  Father's Admonition  beforehand and Mr  Parker died soon after  he had seen the Dream or Vision perform'd  This Relation is inserted also in the  Great  Lord  Clarendon  's History and in Sir  Richard Baker  's Chronicle The Lord  Clarendon  in his History Vol  L  having given some Relations says that amongst others there was one meaning this of  Parker  which was upon a  better Foundation of Credit  than  usually  such Discourses are founded upon And he tells us that  Parker  was an Officer in the King's Wardrobe in  Windsor  Castle of a good Reputation for Honesty and Discretion and then about the Age of Fifty Years or more This Man had in his Youth been bred in a School in the Parish where Sir  George Villiers  the Father of the Duke lived and had been much cherish'd and obliged in that Season of his Age by the said Sir  George  whom afterwards he never saw About Six Months before the miserable End of the Duke of  Buckingham  the Apparition was seen after the Third Appearance he made a Journey to  London  where the Court then was he was very well known to Sir  Ralph Freeman  one of the Masters of the Requests who had married a Lady that was near allied to the  Duke and was himself well receiv'd by him He inform'd the Duke with the Reputation and Honesty of the Man and Sir  Ralph Freeman  carry'd the Man the next Morning by Five of the Clock to  Lambeth  according to the Duke's Appointment and there presented him to the Duke who receiv'd him courteously at his landing and walk'd in Conference near an Hour with him and Sir  Ralph  's and the Duke's Servants at such a distance that they heard not a Word but Sir  Ralph  always fix'd his  Eyes  on the Duke who sometimes spoke with great  Commotion  and  Disorder  and that the Man told Sir  Ralph  in their return over the Water that when he  mentioned  those  particulars  that were to gain him  Credit  the Duke's  Colour changed  and he swore he could come to that Knowledge only by the  Devil  for that those particulars were known only to himself and to one Person more who he was sure would never speak of them So far the Lord  Clarendon  I will now subjoin an authentick Relation which Mr  Beaumont  tells us at the end of his Book of  Genii  or familiar Spirits printed in the Year he had just before receiv'd from the Mouth of the then Bishop of  Gloucester  himself It is as follows Word for Word  Sir  Charles Lee  by his first Lady had only one Daughter of which she died in Childbirth and when she died her Sister the  Lady  Everard  desir'd to have the Education of the Child and she was by her very well educated till she was Marriageable and a Match was concluded for her with Sir  William Perkins  but was then prevented in an extraordinary manner Upon a Thursday Night she thinking she saw a Light in her Chamber after she was in Bed knock'd for her Maid who presently came to her and she ask'd why she left a Candle burning in her Chamber The Maid said she left none and there was none but what she brought with her at that Time Then she said it was the Fire But that the Maid told her was quite out and said she believ'd it was only a Dream whereupon she said it might be so and compos'd herself again to Sleep but about Two of the Clock she was awaken'd again and saw the Apparition of a little Woman between her Curtain and her Pillow who told her she was her Mother and that she was Happy and that by Twelve of the Clock that Day she should be with her whereupon she knock'd again for her Maid called for her Cloaths and when she was dress'd went into her Closet and came not out again till Nine and then brought out with her a Letter sealed to her Father brought it to her Aunt the Lady  Everard  told her what had happen'd and desir'd that assoon as she was Dead it might be sent to him but the Lady thought she was suddenly fallen  Mad and thereupon sent presently away to  Chelmsford  for a Physician and Surgeon who both came immediately but the Physician could discern no Indication of what the Lady immagined or of any Indisposition of her Body notwithstanding the Lady would needs have her let Blood which was done accordingly and when the young Woman had patiently let them do what they would with her she desir'd that the Chaplain might be called to read Prayers and when Prayers were ended she took her  Gittar  and  Psalmbook  and sat down upon a Chair without Arms and play'd and sung so melodiously and admirably that her Musickmaster who was then there admired at it and near the Stroke of Twelve she rose and sat herself down in a great Chair with Arms and presently fetching a strong Breathing or Two immediately expired and was so suddenly Cold as was much wonder'd at by the Physician and Surgeon She died at  Waltham  in  Essex  Three Miles from  Chelmsford  and the Letter was sent to Sir  Charles  at his House in  Warwickshire  But he was so afflicted with the death of his Daughter that he came not till she was buried but when he came he caus'd her to be taken up and to be buried by her Mother at  Edmunton  as she desir'd in her Letter This was about the Year one Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty Two or Sixty Three And this Relation the Right  Reverend the Lord Bishop of  Gloucester  had from Sir  Charles Lee  himself and Mr  Beaumont  printed it in his Book abovementioned from the Bishops own Mouth  The Relations which I have given above are not like the trifling Accounts too often given of these things and therefore causing grave ones to be ridiculed in common with them They are of that Nature that whoever attempts to ridicule them will instead of turning them into Jest become the Object of Ridicule himself  The first Story which has in it such amazing Circumstances and such uncommon and dreadful Incidents concerning the Butler in  Ireland  is as the Reader sees attested by no less a Personage than an Earl of  Orrery  Two Bishops and many other Noblemen and Gentlemen being present and Eyewitnesses of what the Earl said What greater Testimony would the most Incredulous have They say such things are told for Interest what Interest could an Earl and  many  Noblemen have in promoting such an Imposture The Incredulous say likewise great and learned Men delight sometimes in putting Frauds upon the World and after laugh at their Credulity Would a Number of  noble  Laymen chuse  Two Prelates  to carry on such a  Fraud  and would Two  pious Bishops  probably Combine with  several  and  some Servants  there present in spreading such a  Deceit  'Tis past believing  and it demands the strictest of moral Faith that can be given to the most unquestion'd History that the Pen of Man ever wrote  The Second Story is founded first upon the Experience of one of the most ingenious Men of that Age Dr  Donne  and then upon the Proof made by his Friend Sir  Robert Drury  who could at first scarce believe it and shall we doubt the Credit of Men whose Company for their Credit be it spoken a  British  Ambassador was proud of gaining  The Third Story is told by  Luther  himself who began the great Work of the Reformation  The Fourth is told by one that was a King's publick Minister and told from his own Trial of the matter where he could have no Interest in the telling it  The Fifth is related by those great Historians the Lord  Clarendon  and Sir  Richard Baker  as a Truth rely'd upon by themselves and fit to be credited by their Readers  The Sixth and last was related to Mr  Beaumont  by the Lord Bishop of  Gloucester  who receiv'd the Account from Sir  Charles Lee  himself to whose Granddaughter the Matter happen'd  Men who will not believe such things as these so well attested to us and given us by such Authorities because they did not see them themselves nor any thing of the like Nature ought not only to deny the  Demon  of  Socrates  but that there was such a Man as  Socrates  himself they should not dispute the  Genii  of  Caesar Cicero Brutus Mark Anthony  but avow that there were never any such Men existing upon Earth and overthrow all credible History whatsoever Mean while all Men but those who run such Lengths in their fantastical Incredulity will from the Facts abovementioned rest satisfied that there are such things as evil and good  Genit  and that Men have sometimes a Commerce with them by all their Senses particularly those of  seeing  and  hearing  and will not therefore be startled at the strange Fragments of Histories which I am going to relate of our young  Duncan Campbell  and look upon some wonderful Adventures which he perform'd by the Intervention of his familiar  Demon  or  Genius  as Falshoods only because they are uncommon and surprizing more especially since they were not done in a corner but by an open way of Profession of a predictor of Things in the Face of the Metropolis of  London  where he settled Young as will appear in the Progress of his Life However some People notwithstanding all this may alledge that though a Man may have a  Genius  appear to him so as to convey into his Mind through his Senses the knowledge of things that are to come to pass yet this happens but on very eminent and extraordinary Occasions The Murder for Example of a prime  Minister and the Favourite of a Monarch in such a manner as it was perform'd on the Great  Buckingham  by  Felton  was a thing so uncommon that it might perhaps deserve by the Permission of Heaven an uncommon Prediction The others likewise are Instances Eminent in their way particularly that of the Lady  Everard  's Niece For that young Lady being then Marriageable and a Treaty for that end being on Foot with Sir  William Perkins  the Divine Providence foreseeing that such a State might call away her Thoughts hitherto bent on him and spiritual Affairs and fix them on the Trifles of this World might perhaps permit her to be called by a holy Mother to the State of Happiness she before her enjoy'd least her Daughter's Mind should change and she go into the Ways of a Sinner But if these Supereminent these scarce and rare Examples may be admitted of Man's holding a Conversation with the spiritualiz'd Beings of another World it will however be far below the Dignity of humane Reason methinks to make such large Concessions to People who pretend to Converse that wonderful way as to allow them the Credit of being able to do it upon every slight Occasion and every indifferent Occurrence of human Life  I cannot help acknowledging that a Man of Wisdom may at first Thought make such an Objection but Reflection will presently  retract it and the same good Sense that taught him to make an Objection so well upon the first Thought will teach him upon Second Thoughts to acquiesce in the Answer  Infants may have no doubt the Benefit of such an attending  Genius  as well as People more advanc'd in Years as may be seen in one of the Instances which is a very famous one relating to the Boy Born in  Prussia  who was attended by one constantly from the Time of his Birth to his Death Besides it is a mistake in the Understanding to immagin that Death which is the determination and end of Life is of more Consequence to be known than the manner of regulating that Life for in reality according to the right way of considering Death or the determination of a Man's Life derives its Importance from the Steps which he took in the due regulation of it and therefore every the least Step proper to be taken for the due regulation of Life is of more Consequence to be known than the Death of a Person though this at first sight carries the Face of Significance and the other nothing better than the look of a Trifle Marriage for example is a Step in Life of the utmost Importance whether we consider that Estate with regard to this or the next World Death is but the finishing of one Person but Marriage may be the introducing of many into the World with Happiness it is therefore  a thing of more importance to be known beforehand and consequently more worthy of the communication of a  Genius  to the Man with whom he convers'd  Possidonius  tells us that a certain  Rhodian  dying nominated Six of his equals and said who should die first who next and so on and the event answer'd the Prediction why then tho' some People are apt to make a Jest of it may not a Man by the intervention of his good  Genius  tell a Woman that is to have Six Husbands who she shall have first who next and so on and the event answer the Prediction If Men of Learning may acquire such Knowledge as to attain to extraordinary Things by their ordinary Faculties why may not ordinary Things be taught others in this extraordinary way For will anybody say that it is easier for a Man to accommodate himself to the knowledge of a  Demon  or  Genius  than for a  Demon  or  Genius  to accommodate himself to the Knowledge of a Man Certain it is indeed that if this good  Genius  that induces a Man with a prophetick kind of Science be any thing resembling a good Angel the  primary end  of his being permitted to direct Mankind must consist in Things relating more to their Welfare hereafter yet I know not why they may not sometimes inspire or openly direct them in human Knowledge and in things relating to human Life so they are of a good Tendency more especially  since such a good Inspiration may be a counterballance to the bad Knowledge which some have been inspir'd with by evil Spirits I would not be thought to go too far in a Point of this Nature and have therefore though perhaps I could say much more if I follow'd entirely my own private Opinion and would venture to introduce it here in Order to communicate it to others and make it a publick one said no more on this Head than what Divines generally teach  But the most unxeceptionable Mistress that teaches these Things to be in Nature is Experience If we had very many People gifted this way the extraordinary Thing would have been become ordinary and therefore I can't help wondering that it should be so ordinary a Thing for wise Men themselves to wonder too much at Things because they are extraordinary and suspect them as Frauds because they are uncommon  There has scarce been any period of Time in which some Person of this prophetick Class has not existed and has not been consulted by the greatest of Men and their Predictions found at the long run to come true ignorant Men always rise to their Belief of them by Experience and the most learned Men submit their great Opinions to Experience but your Men of  midling Talents  who make up their want of Reason with bustling Obstinacy and noisy Contradiction have been and still  continue to be their own Opposers and without discovering the reason for what they say they content themselves with having the laugh on their sides and barely affirming without proving that it is a kind of  ideal Juggle  and  intellectual Legerdemain  by which these modern Predictors impose things upon the Eye of Reason as the corporeal Eye is impos'd upon by slight of Hand but it is a strange thing that Men of such quick Reason can't give us a Sample of the Frauds Thus I remember to have read I can't tell where a Story of some Courtiers who when a great Artist of  Legerdemain  was to act before the King pretended to be so quick sighted that nothing he did should escape their Discovery were left by his nimble Fingers in the Dark and forc'd at last with Blushes to own they had no better Eyes than other People In a Word if People will be led by Suspicions and remote possibilities of Fraud and Contrivance of such Men all Historical Truth shall be ended when it consists not with a Man's private Humour or Prejudice to admit it Now therefore to prove by Experience and undeniable Testimonies that these kind of  Genii  will submit to little Offices in order to bring Men to greater Good I will give the Reader Three or Four curious Passages that will set the reasonable Reader at ease and prepare him for reading the Passages of Mr  Campbell  's Life with Pleasure and as a fine History of wonderful  Facts that though they seem to surpass Belief yet ought to have his Credit  What in Nature can be more trivial than for a Spirit to employ himself in knocking on a Morning at the Wainscot by the Bedshead of a Man who got drunk over Night according to the way that such things are ordinarily explain'd And yet I shall give you such a Relation of this that not even the most devout and precise  Presbyterian  will offer to call in Question For Mr  Baxter  in his Historical Discourse of Apparitions writes thus  There is now in  London  an understanding sober pious Man oft one of my Hearers who has an elder Brother a Gentleman of considerable Rank who having formerly seem'd Pious of late Years does often fall into the Sin of Drunkenness he often Lodges long together here in his Brother's House and whensoever he is Drunk and has slept himself Sober something knocks at his Bed'shead as if one knock'd on a Wainscot When they remove his Bed it follows him Besides other loud Noises on other Parts where he is that all the House hears they have often watch'd him and kept his Hands least he should do it himself His Brother has often told it me and brought his Wife a discreet Woman to attest it who avers moreover that as she watch'd him she has seen his Shoes under the Bed taken up and nothing Visible to touch them They brought the Man himself  to me and when we ask'd him how he dare Sin again after such a warning he had no excuse But being Persons of Quality for some special Reason of worldly Interest I must not name him  Two things are remarkable in this Instance says Mr  Baxter    first  What a powerful thing Temptation and fleshly Concupiscence is and what an harden'd Heart Sin brings Men to if one rose from the Dead to warn such Sinners it would not of itself perswade them  Secondly  says Mr  Baxter  It Poses me to think what kind of  Spirit  this is that has such a care of this Man's Soul which makes me hope he will Recover Do good  Spirits  dwell so near us or are they sent on such Messages Or is it his Guardian Angel Or is it the Soul of some dead Friend that Suffers and yet retaining Love to him as  Dives  to his Brethren would have him saved God yet keeps such things from us in the Dark  So far we have the Authority of the renown'd and famous Mr  Baxter  who makes this knocking of the  Spirit  at the Bed'shead though what we commonly call frivolous an important Errand  Another Relation of this kind was sent to Mr  John Beaumont  whom I myself personally know and which he has inserted in his Account of  Genit  or  familiar Spirits  in a Letter by an ingenious and learned Clergyman of  Wil  shire  ▪ who had given him the Relation  likewise before by Word of Mouth It is as follows  Near Eighty Years since in the Parish of  Wilcot  which is by the Devizes in the Vicar's House there was heard for a considerable Time the sound of a Bell constantly tolling every Night the occasion was this A debauch'd Person who liv'd in the Parish came one Night very late and demanded the Keys of the Church of the Vicar that he might ring a Peal which the Vicar refus'd to let him have alledging the unseasonableness of the Time and that he should by granting his Desires give a disturbance to Sir  George Wroughton  and his Family whose House adjoined to the Churchyard Upon this refusal the Fellow went away in a Rage threatning to be reveng'd of the Vicar and going some time after to the Devizes met with one  Cantle  or  Cantlow  a Person  noted  in those Days for a  Wizard  and he tells him how the Vicar had serv'd him and begs his help to be even with him The Reply  Cantel  made him was this does he not love ringing He shall have enough of it And from that Time a Bell began to Toll in his House and continued so to do till  Cantell  's Death who confess'd at  Fisherton  Goal in  Sarum  where he was confin'd by King  James  during his Life that he caus'd that Sound and that it should be heard in that Place during Life The Thing was so notorious that  Persons came from all Parts to hear it And King  James  sent a Gentleman from  London  on purpose to give him Satisfaction concerning the Truth of the Report Mr  Beaumont  had likewise this Story as he tells from the Mouth of Sir  George Wroughton  's own Son with this remarkable Circumstance that if any in the House put their Heads out of the Window they could not hear the Sound but heard it immediately again as soon as they stood in the Room  The Reader here sees that good and bad  Genit  exercise themselves upon very little Functions knocking at Bed'sheads and ringing of Bells For Proof of this we have the Testimonies of Two Divines of a Man of Quality and Probity and the same Satisfaction that a learned King had who sent to inquire into the matter and after this there can be I think no room for Doubt  But to carry the Point still nearer Home Inasmuch as I know some will leave no Stone unturn'd to make the extraordinary Actions which the Person whose Life I write has perform'd appear Impostures and inasmuch as for this End they may say that though many People may have been gifted in this extraordinary manner yet not so as to make a Profession of it and therefore from thence they take their Suspicions I shall in this Place to remove every nicest Scruple they can have touching this Affair give the Reader one  Instance of this kind likewise before I proceed with my History  There lived not many Years since a very aged Gentlewoman in  London  in  Waterlane  by  Fleetstreet  whose Name was  Pight  who was endow'd with a prophetick  Spirit  And the ingenious Mr  Beaumont  whom I personally knew and who had a familiar  Genius  himself gives the World this Account of her She was very well known says he to many Persons of my Acquaintance now living in  London  Among others a Gentleman whose Candour I can no way suspect has told me that he often resorted to her as to an Oracle and that assoon as he came into her Presence she would usually tell him that she knew what he was coming for for that she had seen his  Spirit  for some Time before And without his saying any thing to her she would commonly tell him what the Business was which he came to consult her about and what the Event of it would be which he always found to fall out as she said and many other Persons now living can testify the like Experience of her as to themselves  Before I conclude this Chapter I am willing to give the Publick one further little History of the like kind with the foregoing ones with this only difference that if it be valued according to the worth the World has always attributed to the very ingenious Person whom it concerns it will be far the most famous  of them all and therefore fittest to finish this Chapter and to crown this part of the Work in which we are showing that Persons have had a Perception of  Genii  or  Spirits  not visible at the same time to others  The famous  Torquatus Tasso  Prince of the  Italian  Poets and scarce inferior to the immortal  Virgil  himself and who seems to injoy the intermingled Guifts of the most accurate  Judgment  of this  Latin  Poet and the more  fertile  and  copious invention  and  fancy  of the  Greek  one  Homer  strongly asserted his own Experience in this kind His Life was written and published in  French Anno  by  D C D D V  who in his Preface tells us that in what he writ he has followed chiefly the History given us in  Italian  by  John Baptista Manso  a  Neapolitan  Gentleman who had been a very  intimate  Friend to  Tasso  In his Life among other things he acquaints us that  Tasso  was naturally of that melancholick Temperament which has always made the greatest Men and that this Temperament being aggravated by many Hardships he had undergone it made him sometimes  beside himself  and that those melancholick Vapors being dispatched he came again to himself like those that return from Fits of the falling Sickness his  Spirit  being as free as before That near his latter End he retired from the City of  Naples  to his Friend  Manso  at  Bisaccia  a small Town in  the Kingdom of  Naples  where  Manso  had a considerable Estate and passed an  Autumn  there in the Diversions of the Season  And here the  French  Author gives us an Account of  Tasso  's sensible Perception of a  Genius  as follows As after these Amusements he usually retired to his Chamber to entertain himself there with his Friend  Manso  the latter had the opportunity to inquire into one of the most singular Effects of  Tasso  's Melancholy of this  heroick Melancholy  as I may call it which raised and brightened his  Spirit  so far it was from depressing or rendring it obscure and which among the Ancients would have reasonably caus'd them to have ascribed a  familiar Demon  to him as to  Socrates  They were often in a warm debate concerning this  Spirit  with which  Tasso  pretended to have so free a Communication I'm too much your Friend said  Manso  to him one Day not to let you know what the World thinks of you concerning this thing and what I think of it myself Is it possible that being inlightened as you are you should be fall'n into so great a Weakness as to think you have a  familiar Spirit  and will you give your Enemies that advantage to be able to prove by your own acknowledgment what they have already published to the World You know they say you did not publish your  Dialogue of the Messenger  as a  fiction  but you would have Men believe  that the  Spirit  which you make to speak there was a  real  and  true Spirit  Hence Men have drawn this injurious Consequence that your Studies have  embroil'd  your Imagination so that there is made in it a  confused mixture  of the Fictions of the  Poets  the Inventions of the  Philosophers  and the Doctrine of  Religion  I am not ignorant answer'd  Tasso  of all that is spread abroad in the World on the account of my  Dialogue  I have taken care divers Times to disabuse my Friends both by Letter and Word of Mouth I prevented ev'n the Malignity of my Enemies as you know at the Time I publish'd my  Dialogue  Men could not be ignorant that I compos'd it for the young Prince of  Mantua  to whom I would explain after an agreeable manner the principal Mysteries of the Platonick Philosophy It was at  Mantua  itself after my Second Flight from  Ferrara  that I form'd the  Idea  of it and I committed it to Paper a little after my unfortunate Return I address'd it to this Prince and all Men might have read in the  Epistle Dedicatory  the Protestation I there make that this  Dialogue  being writ according to the Doctrine of the  Platonicks  which is not always conformable to reveal'd Truths Men must not confound what I expose there as a  Philosopher  with what I believe as a  Christian  This distinction is by so much the more reasonable that at that Time  nothing extraordinary had happened to me and I spake not of any  Apparition  This can be attested by all those with whom I lodged or whom frequented in this Voyage and therefore there is no reason for confounding the Fiction of my  Dialogue  with what has happen'd to me since I am perswaded of all you say to me reply'd  Manso  but truly I cannot be of what you believe at present concerning yourself Will you imagin that you are in Commerce with a  Spirit  And I ask you of what Order is that  Spirit  Shall we place him in the number of the Rebels whom their Pride precipitated into the  Abyss  Or of the Intelligences who continued firm in Faith and Submission to their Creator For there is no mean to take in the true Religion and we must not fall into the extravagances of the  Gnomes  and  Silphs  of the  Cabalists  Now the  Spirit  in Question cannot be a  Demon  You own that instead of inspiring you any thing contrary to Piety and Religion he often fortifies in you the Maxims of Christianity he strengthens your Faith by profound reasonings and has the same Respect with you for sacred Names and Things Neither can you say that it's an  Angel  for tho' you have always led a regular Life and far from all Dissoluteness tho' for some Years past you have apply'd yourself after a particular manner to the Duties of a true Christian you will agree with me that these sorts  of Favors are not common that a Man must have attained to a high degree of Sanctity and not be far from the pureness of Celestial  Spirits  to merit a familiar Converse and bear a Harmony with them Believe me there is nothing in all these Discourses which you imagin you have with this  Spirit  You know better than any Man those Symptoms which the black Humours wherewith you are tormented causes in you Your Vapours are the source of your Visions and yourself would not iudge otherwise of another Person to whom a like thing should happen and you will come to this in your own respect also if you will make a mature Reflection and apply yourself to blot out by an effort of Reason these Immaginations which the violence of your evil Effect causes in you You may have Reason reply'd  Tasso  to think so of the things that pass in me but as to myself who have a sensible Perception of them I am forced to reason after another manner If it were true that the  Spirit  did not shew himself to me but in the violent assault of my Vapours If he offer'd to my Immagination but wandring and confus'd  Species  without Connection or due Sequel if he us'd to me frivolous reasonings which ended in nothing or it having begun some solid reasoning he broke it off on a sudden and left me in Darkness I should believe with you that all things that pass are but mere Dreams  and Phantoms But it's quite otherwise This  Spirit  is a  Spirit  of Truth and Reason and of a Truth so distinct of a Reason so sublime that he raises me often to Knowledges that are above all my reasonings tho' they appear to me no less clear that he teaches me things which in my most profound Meditations never came into my Spirit and which I never heard of any Man nor read in any Book This  Spirit  therefore is somewhat of  real  of whatsoever Order he be I hear him and see him nevertheless for its being impossible for me to comprehend and define him  Manso  did not yield to these Facts which  Tasso  would have pass'd for Proofs He press'd him with new  Questions  which were not without  Answers  Since you will not believe me on my Word said  Tasso  to him another Day after having well disputed I must convince you by your own Eyes that these things are not pure Imaginations And the next Day conversing together in the same Chamber  Manso  perceiv'd that on a sudden he fix'd his Eyes towards the Window and that he stood as it were immovable he call'd to him and  ogg'd him many times but instead of answering him  see there the Spirit says  Tasso at last  that has been pleased to come and visit me and to entertain himself with me look on him and you will acknowledge the Truth of what I say  Manso  somewhat surprized cast his Eyes towards the Place he shewed him and perceiv'd nothing but the Rays of the Sun passing through the Glass nor did he see any thing in all the Chamber though he cast his Eyes round it with Curiosity and he desir'd him to shew him the  Spirit  which he look'd for in vain while he heard  Tasso  speak with much Vehemency He declares in a Letter which he writ concerning this to the Admiral of  Naples  that he really heard no other Voice but  Tasso  's own But they were sometimes  Questions  made by him to the pretended  Spirit  sometimes  Answers  that he made to the pretended  Questions  of the  Spirit  and which were couch'd in such admirable Terms so efficacious concerning Subjects so elevated and so extraordinary that he was ravished with Admiration and dared not to interrupt him He hearken'd therefore attentively and being quite beside himself at this mysterious Conversation which ended at last by a recess of the  Spirit  as he found by the last Words of  Tasso  after which  Tasso  turning himself to him well said he are your doubts at last dissipated On the contrary answer'd  Manse  I am more imbroiled than ever I have truly heard wonderful things but you have not shewed me what you promised me you have seen and heard resumed  Tasso  perhaps more thanhe stop'd here and  Manso  who could not recover  himself of his surprize and had his Head filled with the  Ideas  of this extraordinary Entertainment found himself not in a condition to press him farther Mean while he engaged himself not to speak a Word to any Man of these things he had heard with a design to make them Publick though he should have Liberty granted him They had many other Conversations concerning this matter after which  Manso  own'd he was brought to that pass that he knew not what to think or say only that if it were a Weakness in his Friend to believe these Visions he much fear'd it would prove contagious to him and that he should become at last as credulous as himself  Dr  Beaumont  who is still living and with whom I have had formerly some acquaintance myself has set down among the others this Relation at large concerning  Tasso  and gives this reason for it because says the Doctor I  think it contains a sufficient Answer to what many learned Friends have said to myself on the like occasion  Perhaps it may not be ungrateful to the Reader if I subjoin here the short  Elogium  writ on  Tasso  by the famous  Thuanus  which is as follows  Torquatus Tasso  died about the Forty Fifth Year of his Age a Man of a wonderful and prodigious Wit who was seized with an incurable Fury in his Youth when he lived at the  Court of  Ferrara  and nevertheless in lucid Intervals he writ many things both in Verse and Prose with so much Judgment Elegancy and extreme correctness of Style that he turn'd at length that Pity which many Men had conceiv'd for him into an Amazement while by that Fury which in others makes their Minds outragious or dulls them after it was over his Understanding became as it were more purified more ready in inventing things more acute in aptly disposing them after they were invented and more copious in adorning them with choice Words and weight of Sentences and that which a Man of the soundest Sense would scarce Excogitate at his leisure with the greatest Labour and Care immaginable he after a violent Agitation of the Mind set beside itself naturally perform'd with a wonderful Felicity so that he did not seem struck with an alienation of Mind but with a divine Fury He that knows not these things which all Men know that have been in  Italy  and concerning which himself sometimes complains though modestly in his Writings let him read his  Divine  Works and he must necessarily conclude either that I  speak  of  another Man  than  Tasso  or that these things were  Written  by  another Man  than  Tasso  After having given my Readers so many memorable Accounts concerning the Perception Men have had in all Ages and still continue to have of  Genii  or  familiar Spirits  by all the Senses as  seeing hearing c  which  Accounts have been attested by Men of the greatest Learning and Quality if any of them still remain dissatisfied I am contented and desire them for their Punishment to lay down the Book before they arrive at the more pleasant Parts of it which are yet to come and not to read one Tittle further These unbelieving Gentlemen shall then be at Liberty according as their different  Spirits  dictate to ridicule me in the same manner as many more learned and greater Men than I have been satyriz'd before my Time by Persons of a like infidel Temper who would fain pass Incredulity upon the World as Wisdom and they may with all the freedom in Nature bestow upon me those  merry  Appellations which I very well know such extraordinary Freethinkers immagin to belong of Right to any Author that either believes himself or would possess the World with an Opinion and Belief that there is such a thing as the holding Commerce and Conversation in this habitable World with  Genit  and  familiar Spirits  I shall only first tell them all I have to say to terminate the Dispute between them and me  Those who to give themselves the Air and Appearance of Men of solid Wisdom and Gravity load other Men who believe in  Spirits  with the Titles of being Men of Folly Levity or Melancholy are desired to learn that the same Folly as they are pleas'd to  term it of Opinion is to be found in the greatest Men of Learning that ever existed in the Universe Let them in order to be convinced of this read  Apuleius  's Book  de deo Socrat Censorinus  's Book  de die Nat c    Porphyrius  in his Book  de Abstinentia Agrippa  in his Treatise  de Occult Phil l    c  and also  c    Natalis  comes in his  Myth l    c    Maraviglia  in his  Pseudomantia Dissertation  and and  Animadversion    Plato  in his  Timaeus Cratylus Ammianus Marcellinus  's History Book  Hieronimus Cardanus  in his Book  de vitâ propriâ c  The great  Kircher  in his  Oedipus Oegyptiacus  Vol  p    Pausanius in Cliac Poster  That immortal Orator  Cicero Lib    de divinatione Lib    de Naturâ Deorum  the  Histoire prodigieuse  written by  Pere Arnault  And a Book intituled  Lux Etenebris  which is a Collection of modern Visions and Prophesies in  Germany  by several Persons translated into  Latin  by  Jo Amos Comenius  printed at  Amsterdam  And if they will be at the pains of having due recourse to these Quotations they will find that all these Men whose Learning is unquestionable and most of whom have been in a firm and undisputed Possession of Fame for many  Centuries  have all unanimously agreed in this Opinion how foolish soever they may think it that there ever was and ever would be a Communication held between some select Men and  Genii  or  familiar  Spirits  I must therefore desire their Pardon if I rejoice to see them remain Wise by themselves and that I continue to be esteemed by them a Fool among so much good Company  Others out of a mere contempt of Religion or cowardly for fear of being thought Pusillanimous by Men turn Bravo's to Heaven and laugh at every Notion of  Spirits  as imbibed from the Nurse or imposed upon us by Priests and may top these Lines upon us with an elegant and a convincing magisterial Sneer though the divine  Socrates  was of our Opinion and even experienc'd it to be true having a  Genius  himself  The Priests but finish what the Nurse began  And thus the Child imposes on the Man  These bring into my Mind a saying of Sir  Roger L'Estrange  on  Seneca  which I must apply to  Socrates  I join in Opinion with a  Christian Heathen  while they remain  Heathen Christians  The Third sort out of a pretended Veneration to Religion and Divinity may call me Superstitious and Chimerical To them I answer I will continue Chimerical and Superstitious with St  Austin  who gives the same Opinion in his  Civitate Dei  with  Ludovicus Vives  let them be solider and more religious Divines than St  Austin  in disowning it Thus I bid these austere Criticks  heartily farewel but let my better natured Readers go on and find a new Example of this Conversation being held with the  Genii  by our  Duncan Campbell  CHAP VI A Narrative of Mr  Campbell  's coming to  London  and taking upon him the Profession of a Predictor together with an Account of many strange things that came to pass just as he foretold  TO proceed on regularly with the Life of young  Duncan Campbell  I must let the Reader know that he continued thus conversing with his little  Genius  as is set forth above in the Dialogue he had with me and predicting many things of the like Nature as I have described till the Year when he was just Fourteen Years of Age and then he left  Scotland  But before I come to speak of the manner of his departure from thence his half native Country inasmuch as his Father was of that Country and he had his Education there what Education he could have being Deaf and Dumb I must let the Reader know that in the Year my very good Friend Mrs  Campbell  his Mother in Law died and left  him there at  Edinburgh  an Orphan of Twelve Years of Age  He was I may venture to say the most beautiful Boy of that Age I ever knew and the sensible Reader who considers a Child of good Birth with the Misfortunes of being Deaf and Dumb left Fatherless and Motherless in the wide World at Twelve Years Old without any Competency for his Maintainance and Support without any Relations in a manner that knew him or assisted him all the little Fortune his Father had having been lost in the civil Commotions in  Scotland  as I have related above need not hear me describe the Compassion I and many more had for him because such a Reader must certainly feel in his own Bosom the same lively Acts of Pity and Commiseration at the hearing of such a Mishap as I had at the seeing it or at least as I have now reviv'd afresh within me at the relating it  However it came so to pass that a Person of the Name of  Campbell  and who was a distant Relation of the Boy though he himself was but in indifferent Circumstances was resolv'd to see him provided for one way or another in a manner somewhat suitable to his Condition and till that Time to take the best care of him himself that he was able  Several Ladies of Quality who had known his Perfections coveted to make the Boy one of their Domesticks as a Page or a Playfellow  to their Children for though he could not speak he had such a Vivacity in all his Actions such a sprightliness of Behaviour and such a Merriment accompanying all his Gestures that he afforded more Entertainment than the prettiest and wittiest little Pratlers at those Years are wont to do Mr  Campbell  had certainly accepted of some of these fortunate Offers for his little Cousin which were many of them likely to prove very Advantageous if it had not been put in his Head by some Friends particularly myself that if he had a mind to dispose of the Boy in that manner the best way he could take would be to present him to the late Earl of  Argyle  who for his Name sake and for his Father's sake as well as the Qualifications and Endowments of the Boy would more naturally according to all Probability take a greater pleasure and delight in him and consequently provide better for him and with a more lasting Care than any other Person of Quality that had a sudden liking to him which might change and took him as a Stranger out of a bare Curiosity Mr  Campbell  was by these Reasons overrul'd in the disposal of his little Dumb Prophetical Cousin as he call'd him and resolv'd that an Offer should be made of him to the present illustrious Duke of  Argyle  's most noble Father But it so unfortunately happened that the Earl making very much a  longer stay at  London  than was expected Mr  Campbell  the Uncle sent our young  Duncan Campbell  his Nephew handsomely accouter'd and with a handsome Summ of Money in his Pocket by Sea with Captain  Meek  of  Kircaldie  to  London  with Letters of Recommendation to the Earl's Favour and just a few Days before young  Duncan  arrived in  London  the Earl was set out on his Journey to his Seat in  Scotland  I had now left him for near Three Years not having seen him since about a Year after his Mother's Death and then coming to  London  I had by mere accident an Appointment to meet some  Scotch  Gentlemen at the  Buffalo  at  Charingcross  There happen'd at that Time to be a great Concourse of  Scotch  Nobility there at an Entertainment and one of the Ladies and Gentlemen passing by and seeing one of my Friends desir'd him to come in and told him both he and his Companions should be very welcome to partake of the Diversion The Lady told him they had got a lovely Youth a  Scotch  Miracle among them that would give us exquisite Delight and write down to us all the Occurrences of our future Lives and tell us our Names upon our first Appearance The Moment I heard of it  Duncan Campbell  came into my Head but as it is a thing not rare to be met with in  Scotland  for Second sighted Persons to tell such things and as the Earl of  Angyle  was  in the North I thought little  Duncan  had been under his Protection and with him and did not dream of meeting with him there and accordingly told my Friend before I went in that I believed I knew a Lad in  Scotland  would exceed this in Foresight let him be as dexterous in his Art as he would  As soon as I enter'd the Room I was surpriz'd to find myself encompass'd and surrounded by a Circle of the most beautiful Females that ever my Eyes beheld In the Centre of this Angelick Tribe was seated a heavenly Youth with the most winning comeliness of Aspect that ever pleased the Sight of any Beholder of either Sex his Face was divinely Fair and ting'd only with such a sprightly Blush as a Painter would use to Colour the Picture of Health with and the Complexion was varnish'd over by a blooming like that of flourishing Fruit which had not yet felt the first Nippings of an unkind and an uncivil Air with this Beauty was join'd such a smiling draught of all the Features as is the result of Pleasantry and good Humour His Eyes were large full of Lustre Majestick well set and the Soul shone so in them as told the Spectators plainly how great was the inward Vivacity of his  Genius  The Hair of his Head was thick and reclin'd far below his Shoulders it was of a fine Silver Colour and hung down in Ringlets like the curling Tendrils of a copious Vine He was by the  Women entertain'd according to the Claim which so many Perfections joining in a Youth just ripening into Manhood might lay to the benevolent Dispositions of the tender Sex One was holding the Bason of Water another washing a Hand a Third with a Towel drying his Face which another Fair had greedily snatch'd the Pleasure of washing before while a Forth was disposing into order his Silver Hairs with an Ivory Comb in an Hand as White and which a Monarch might have been proud to have had so employ'd in adjusting the Crown upon his Head a Fifth was setting into Order his Crevat a Sixth stole a Kiss and blush'd at the innocent Pleasure and mistook her own Thoughts as if she kiss'd the Angel and not the Man and they all rather seem'd to adore than to love him as if they had taken him not for a Person that enjoy'd the frequent Gift of the Second Sight but as if he had been some little Prophet peculiarly inspired and while they all thus admired and wonder'd they all consulted him as an Oracle The surprize of seeing a young Man so happy amidst the general concurring Favours of the Fair made me be for a while lost in a kind of delightful Amazement and the consideration of what Bliss he was possess'd made me scarce believe my own Eyes when they told me it was  Duncan Campbell  who I had left an unhappy Orphan at  Edinburgh  But so it was though he was much  altered in Stature being now shot up pretty fast in his Growth since I had seen him and having gain'd a kind of a fix'd Comportment such as we may daily observe in those who are taking leave of their Minority and stepping into a Stage of maturer Life  The first remarkable thing I knew him do in  London  being in this splendid Company where there were so many undoubted Witnesses of Quality too that had ocular Proof of his Predictions at that publick Tavern I chuse to Record it here in the first Place according to its due Order It was in the Year  Among this Angelical Class of Beauties were Dr  W  lw  d  's Lady and Daughter Upon Earth there was not sure a more beautiful Creature than the Daughter was she was the leading Light of all the sparkling Tribe and  Otway  's Character suits her exactly for she was  among Ten Thousand eminently Fair  One would imagin prosperous and lucky Fortune was written upon her Face and that nothing unhappy could be read in so fair a Book and it was therefore the unanimous Consent of all that by way of good Omen to the rest his Predictions should begin to be open'd luckily that Day and that therefore he should first of all be consulted about her  Accordingly the Mother to be satisfied of his Talent before she proceeded to any other  Questions ask'd him in writing if he knew the young Lady her Name and who she was After a little ruminating and pondering upon the matter and taking an exact View of the Beauty he wrote down her Name told Mrs  W  lw  d  she was her Daughter and that her Father was a Doctor Convinced by his so readily telling the Name and Quality of Persons he had never seen in his Lifetime that Fame had not given a false Character of his Capacity she proceeded in her Questions as to her future Fortune He gaz'd a fresh at her very eagerly for some time and his Countenance during that time of viewing her seem'd to be rufled with abundance of Disturbance and Perplexity We all imagin'd that the Youth was a little touch'd at the Heart himself with what he saw and that instead of telling hers he had met in her bright Eyes with his own Destiny the Destiny of being for ever made a Slave and a Captive to so many powerful and almost irresistable Charms  At length after having a long Debate within himself which we thought proceeded from the struglings of Love and Passion he fetching a great Sigh which still convinced us more took the Pen and wrote to Mrs  W  lw  d  that he beg'd to be excus'd and that his Pen might remain as Dumb and Silent as his Tongue on that Affair By this Answer we concluded one and all  that our former Conjectures were true and we join'd in pressing him the more earnestly to deliver his real and sincere Opinion concerning the Accidents upon which the future Fortunes of her Life were to turn and depend He shew'd many mighty Reluctances in the doing it and I have often since considered him in the same Anguish as the late great Dr  Ratcliff  who was endeavouring by Study to save a certain fair One whom he lov'd with a vehemence of Temper and who was as his Reason told him got far away beyond the reach of the Art of Physick to recover At last he wrote in plain Terms that his backwardness and unwillingness to tell it arose from his wishes that her Fortune would be better than his certain Foreknowledge of it told him it would be and beg'd that we would rest satisfied with that general Answer since it was in so particular a Case where he himself was a wellwisher in vain to the Lady about whom he was consulted The young Lady herself thinking that if she knew any Disasters that were to befal her she might by knowing the nature of them beforehand and the time when they were likely to happen be able by timely Prudence and Forecast to avert those Evils with many beseechings urg'd him to reveal the fatal Secret After many struggles to avoid it and as many Instances made to him both by Mother and Daughter for the discovery  of his Prescience in that Point he comply'd with very great difficulty and blotting the Paper with Tears that trickled fast from his Eyes he gave her the lamentable Scroll containing the Words that follow  viz  I wish it had not fallen to my Lot to tell this Lady whom every Body that but once looks at her must admire though they must not have leave to love that she is not much longer to be possessor of that lovely Face which gains her such a number of Adorers The small Pox will too soon turn a Ravisher and rifle all those Sweets and Charms that might be able to vanquish a King and to subdue a Conqueror of mighty Battles Her Reign is doom'd alass to be as short as it is now Great and Universal I believe she has interval Beauties of the Mind not the least inferior to those external Excellencies of the Body and she might perhaps by the power of her Mind alone be absolute Queen of the Affections of Men if the small Pox threaten'd not too surely to be her further Enemy and not contented to destroy the Face was not perversely bent to destroy the whole Woman But I want Words to express my SorrowI would not tell it if you did not extort the baneful Secret from my BosomThis fair Creature whose Beauty would make one wish her Immortal will by the cruel means of the small Pox give us too sudden a Proof of her MortalityBut neither  the Mother nor herself ought too much too repine at this seeing it appears to be the Decree of Providence which is always to be interpreted as meant for our Good and seeing it may be the means of translating her the sooner only to her kindered Angels whose Beauty she so much resembles here on Earth and to be among the lowest Class of whom is better than being the greatest Beauty of the World here below and wearing an Imperial CrownWhile I comfort you I can't help the force of Nature which makes me grieve myself and I only give you because you compel me to it so particular and so exact an Answer to so particular and so exacting a Question  The Mother who took the Paper was prudent enough to conceal from the Daughter what he said but Nature would force its way and bubled from her Eyes and the Daughter perceiving that press'd hard to see it and wept at the consideration that hard Fate though she knew not particularly what way was to befal her Never surely was any thing so beautiful in Tears and I obtain'd of the Mother to see the WritingAt last in general Terms to free her from a suspense of Mind it was told her that some Trouble should happen to her that would diminish her Beauty She had Courage enough to hear that Misfortune with disdain and crying if that be all I am arm'd I dont place much  Pride in that which I know Age must shortly after destroy if Trouble did not do it before and she dry'd up her Tears and if what Mr  Bruyere  says be true  viz  that the last thing a celebrated Woman thinks of when she dies is the loss of her Beauty she shew'd an admirable Pattern of female Philosophy in bearing such a cruel Prediction with such unspeakable Magnanimity as exceeded even the Patience of stern Stoism considering she was a Woman to whom Beauty is more dear than Life  If any Evil that is impending over Peoples Heads could be evaded by Foreknowledge or eluded by Art she had the fairest opportunity of having this Prediction annulled which would have been more to the satisfaction of the Predictor than knowing it verified than ever any Woman had Her Mother was specifically told that the fatal Distemper should be the small Pox her Father was and is still a very Eminent Physician and Distempers of that kind especially are much more easily prevented by Care than cur'd by Art and by Art more easily set aside when there is a timely warning given to a Physician to prepare the Body against the danger of the Poison than when the Distemper has once catch'd hold of a Body at unawares when it is unpurg'd of any gross Humours that may accompany it But neither the Foreknowledge and Caution of the  Mother nor the Skill and Wisdom of the great Physician her Father were sufficient to ward off the approaching Harm that was written in the Books of Fate Not many Suns had finished their yearly Courses before she was forc'd to submit to the inevitable Stroak of Death after the infectious and malicious Malady had first ravag'd her Beauty rioted in all her Sweets and made an odious deform'd Spectacle of the Charmer of Mankind The Death of the Daughter work'd hard upon the Mother's Bowels and dragg'd her speedily after her with a broken Heart to the Grave  This Lady whose Fortune so great and so distinguish'd an Assembly had chosen to hear as a happy Forerunner and lucky Omen of all their own which were to be ask'd afterwards in their turns proving so contrary to their Expectations already unfortunate in the Prediction and having been in Tears about the matter dishearten'd all the rest of the Beauties from consulting him further that Day The Person who kept the Tavern by Name Mrs  Irwin  alledg'd that as some People were very fortunate and others unfortunate upon the same Day so one Lady might be before told a mishap one Minute and another Lady all the Prosperity in Nature the very next Minute following and therefore that what the unfortunate Lady had heard was not to be taken as Ominous or  as what could Malignantly influence the Day neither ought it to be the least hinderance to any who had the curiosity of being let into the Secrets of Time beforehand However whether the Ladies were convinc'd or no if she prevail'd over their Belief in that Point she could not prevail over their Humour which though they might not believe the former Prediction ominous to themselves was naturally aw'd for fear of the like peradventure for a Time and so it was agreed  nemine Contradicente  as a witty Lady wrote it down that no more Petitions should for that Day be presented by any of that Company to his Dumb yet oracular Majesty Mrs  Irwin  however would have her way said she did not presume to such Honour as to call herself of that Company and that therefore she might consult him without breaking through the Votes of the Assembly Many endeavour'd to disswade her but as she was passionately fond of knowing future Events and had a mighty itch to be very inquisitive with the Oracle about what might happen not only to herself but her Posterity it was agreed that he should have the liberty of satisfying her Curiosity since she presum'd her Fortune was sure to be so Good and was so forward and eager for the knowledge of it But alass such is too often the fantastical Impulse of Nature unluckily depraved that it carries often into wishes of  knowing what when known we would be glad to unknow again and then our Memory will not let us be untaught  Mrs  Irwin  was at that time in a pretty commodious way of Business every thing in Plenty round about her and liv'd more like a Person of Distinction that kept such a Cellar of Wine open House and a free Table than like one who kept a Tavern She brought in her Three pretty Children that were then almost Babies the youngest having not long been out of the Nurses Arms or trusted to the use of its own Legs These Children she lov'd as a Mother should love Children they were the delight of her Eyes all Day and the Dream of her Imagination all Night All the Passions of her Soul were confin'd to them she was never pleas'd but when they were so and always angry if they were cross'd her whole Pride was centered in them and they were cloath'd and went attended more like the Infants of a Princess than of a Vintner's Relict The Fortune of these was what she had near at Heart and of which she was so eager of being immediately apprized Her Impatience was proportionable to the love she had for them and which made her wish to foreknow all the Happiness that was like to attend them She sate chearfully down presented one to him and smiling wrote the Question in general Terms  viz  is this Boy to be Happy or Unhappy  A melancholy Look once more spread itself all over the Face of the Predictor when he read the too inquisitive Words and he seem'd mightily to regret being ask'd a Question to which he was by his Talent of foreseeing compell'd to give so unwelcome an Answer The Colour of the poor Woman flush'd and vanish'd alternately and very quick and she look'd not quite like the Picture of Despair but a disconsolate Woman with little Hopes on one Hand and great Doubts and dismal Fears on the other She profess'd she read great Evil in the Troubles of his Face thank'd him for his good nature told him that they all knew that though he could foretell he could not alter the acts and decretals of Fate and therefore desir'd him to tell her the worst for that the Misfortunes were they never so great would be less dreadful to her than remaining in the State of Fear and Suspension He at last wrote down to her that great and unexpected and even unavoidable Accidents would involve the whole Family in new Calamities that the Son she ask'd him about would have the bitterest task of Hardship to go through withal while he lived and that to finish all more unhappily he would be basely and maliciously brought to an untimely End by some mortal Enemy or other but that she should not trouble herself so much on that head she would never see it for it would happen some Years after she was departed  from the World This melancholy Account clos'd up the Book of Predictions for that Day and put a sad stop to all the projected Mirth and Curiosity Now I must tell the Reader how and when the event answer'd the Prediction And in a few Words it was thus poor Mrs  Irwin  by strange Accidents decay'd in the World and dying Poor her Sons were forc'd to be put out Apprentices to small Trades and the Son whom the abovementioned Prediction concern'd was for stealing one Cheese from a Man in the  Haymarket  severely prosecuted at the  Old Bailey  and on Wednesday the Twenty Third of  December  hang'd at  Tyburn  with several other Criminals  The Two foregoing Passages are of so tragical a Nature that it is time I should relieve the Minds of my Readers with some Histories of Ladies who consulted him with more Success and Advantage to whom his Predictions were very entertaining when they so came to pass in their Favour the Relation whereof will consequently be agreeable to all Readers who have within them a mixture of happy Curiosity and good Nature  Two Ladies who were the most remarkable Beauties in  London  and the most courted turn'd at the same time their Thoughts to Matrimony and being satiated I may say wearied with the Pleasure of having continually after them a great number and variety  of Adorers resolv'd each about the same time to make a choice of their several Men to whom they thought they could give most Happiness and from whom they might receive most Their Names for they are both Persons of Distinction shall be  Christallina  and  Urbana Christallina  was a Virgin and  Urbana  a young Widow  Christallina  engross'd the Eyes the Hearts and the Sighs of the whole Court and wherever she appeared put any Court Lady out of her Place that had one before in the Heart of any Youth and was the celebrated Toast among the  Beau Monde Urbana  's Beauty made as terrible Havock in the City All the Citizens Daughters that had many Admirers and were in fair Hopes of having Husbands when they pleas'd themselves assoon as  Urbana  had lost her old Husband found that they every Day lost their Lovers and 'twas a general fear among the prettiest Maids that they should remain Maids still as long as  Urbana  remain'd a Widow She was the Monopolizer of City Affection and made many Girls that had large stocks of Suiters Bankrupts in the Trade of Courtship and broke some of their Hearts when her Charms broke off their AmoursWell but the Day was near at Hand when both the  Belles  of the Court and the City Damsels were to be freed from the ravages which these Two Tyrants triumphant in Beauty and insolent in Charms made among  the Harvest of Love Each had seen her proper Man to whom the Enjoyment of her Person was to be dedicated for Life But it being an Affair of so lasting Importance each had a mind to be let into the knowledge of the consequences of such a Choice as far as possible before they step'd into the irrevocable State of Matrimony Both of them happen'd to take it into their Heads that the best way to be entirely satisfied in their Curiosity was to have recourse to the great Predictor of future Occurrences Mr  Duncan Campbell  whose Fame was at that Time spread pretty largely about the Town  Christallina  and  Urbana  were not acquainted with each other only by the report which Fame had made of Beauty They came to Mr  Campbell  's on the same Day and both with the same resolution of keeping themselves conceal'd and under Masks that none of the Company of Consulters who happen'd to be there might know who they were It happened that on that very Day just when they came Mr  Campbell  's Rooms were more than ordinarily crowded with curious Clients of the fair Sex so that he was oblig'd to desire these Two Ladies who express'd so much precaution against and fear of having their Persons discover'd to be contented with only one Room between them and with much ado they comply'd with the request and condescended to sit together  Incog  Distant  Compliments of Gesture pass'd between them the dress and comportment of each making them appear to be Persons of Figure and Breeding and after Three or Four modish Curtesies down they sat without so much as once opening their Lips or intending so to do The Silence between them was very formal and profound for near half an Hour and nothing was to be heard but the snapping of Fans which they both did very tuneably and with great Harmony and plaid as it were in Consort  At last one of the  civil well bred Mutes  happening to  Sneeze  the other very gracefully bow'd and before she was well aware out popp'd the WordsBless you Madam the fair Sneezer return'd the Bow with anI thank you Madam They found they did not know one another's Voices and they began to talk very merrily together with pretty great confidence and they taking a mutual liking from Conversation so much familiarity grew thereupon instantly between them that they began not only to unmask but to unbosom themselves to one another and confess alternately all their Secrets  Christallina  own'd who she was and told  Urbana  the Beau and Courtier that had her Heart  Urbana  as franckly declared that she was a Widow that she would not become the Ladies Rival that she had pitch'd upon a Second Husband an Alderman of the City  Just by that time they had had their chat out and wish'd one another the pleasure of a successful Prediction it came to  Christallina  's turn to visit the Dumb Gentleman and receive from his Pen oracular Answers to all the Questions she had to propose Well he accordingly satisfied her in every Point she ask'd him about but while she was about this one of Mr  Campbell  's Family going with  Urbana  to divert her a little The Widow railed at the Virgin as a Fool to immagin that she should ever make a Conquest of the brightest Spark about the Court and then let she some random bolts of Malice to wound her Reputation for Chastity Now it became the Widow's turn to go and consult And the same Person of Mr  Campbell  's Family in the mean time entertain'd  Christallina  The Maid was not behind hand with the Widow she rail'd against the Widow represented her as sometimes a Coquette sometimes a Lady of Pleasure sometimes a Jilt and lifted up her Hands in Wonder and Amazement that  Urbana  should immagin so rich a Man as an Alderman  such a one  should fall to her Lot Thus  Urbana  swore and protested that  Christallina  could never arrive at the Honour of being the Wife to the courtly  Secretarius  let Mr  Campbell  flatter her as he would and  Christallina  vow'd that  Campbell  must be a downright  Wizard  if he foretold that such a one as  Urbana  would get Alderman  Stiffrump  for a Husband provided a Thing so improbable should come to pass  However it seems  Duncan  had told them their own Names and the Names of their Suiters and told them further how soon they were both to be married and that too directly to their Heart's content as they said rejoicingly to themselves and made their mutual Gratulations  They went away each satisfied that she should have her own Lover but  Christallina  laugh'd at Mr  Campbell  for assigning the Alderman to  Urbana  and  Urbana  laugh'd at him for promising the Courtier to the Arms of  Christallina  This is a pretty good Figure of the Tempers of Two reigning Toasts with regard to one another  First  Their Curiosity made them from resolving to be concealed discover one another wilfully from utter Strangers grow as familiar as old Friends in a Moment swear one another to Secrecy and exchange the Sentiments of their Hearts together and from being Friends become envious of each other's enjoying a Similitude of Happiness the Compliments made on either side Face to Face were upon the turning of the Back turn'd into Reflections Detraction and Ridicule each was a Selflover and Admirer of her own Beauty and Merit and a Despiser of the other's  However  Duncan Campbell  proved at last to be in the right  Urbana  was wrong in her opinion of  Christallina  's want of power over  Secretarius  and  Christallina  was as much out in her opinion that  Urbana  would miss in her aim of obtaining  Stiffrump  For they both prov'd in the right of what they thought with regard to their own dear single Persons and were made happy according to their Expectations just at the time foretold by Mr  Campbell  Christallina  's ill Wishes did not hinder  Urbana  from being Mistress of Alderman  Stiffrump  's Person and Stock nor did  Urbana  's hinder  Christallina  from shewing herself a shining Bride at the Ring in  Secretarius  's gilded Chariot drawn by Six Prancers of the proud  Belgian  Kind with her half dozen of Liveries with Favours in their Hats waiting her return at the Gate of  Hydepark  Both lov'd and both envy'd but both allow'd of Mr  Campbell  's Foreknowledge  Having told you Two very sorrowful Passages and one tolerably successful and entertaining I shall now relate to you another of my own knowledge that is mix'd up with the Grievous and the Pleasant and checquer'd as it were with the Shade and the Sunshine of Fortune  Though there are Vicissitudes in every Stage or Life under the Sun and not one ever ran continually on with the same series  of Prosperity yet those Conditions which are the most liable to the signal Alterations of Fortune are the Conditions of Merchants for profest Gamesters I reckon in a manner as Men of no condition of Life at all but what comes under the Statute of Vagabonds  It was indeed as the Reader would guess a worthy and a wealthy Merchant who was to run through these different Circumstances of Being He came and visited our Mr  Campbell  in the Year he found him amidst a Croud of Consulters and being very eager and solicitous to know his own Fortune just at that critical juncture of time he begg'd of him if possible to adjourn his other Clients to the Day following and sacrifice that one wholly to his use which as it was probably more important than all the others together so he wrote down that he would render the time spent about it more advantagious to Mr  Campbell  and by way of previous Encouragement threw him down Ten Guineas as a retaining Fee  Mr  Campbell  who held Money in very little esteem and valued it so much too little that he has often had my Reprehensions on that head paused a little and after looking earnestly in the Gentleman's Face and reading there as I suppose in that little space of time in general according to the power of the Second Sight that what concern'd him was highly momentous wrote him this Answer  that he would comply with his requests adjourn his other Clients to the Day following and set apart all the remnant of that till Night for inspecting the future Occurrences of which he had a mind to be made a Master  There is certainly a very keen Appetite in Curiosity It cannot stay for satisfaction it is pressing for its necessary repast and is without all patience Hunger and Thirst are not Appetites more vehement and more hard and difficult to be repress'd than that of Curiosity Nothing but the  present Now  is able to allay it A more expressive Picture of this I never beheld than in the Faces of some and the murmurs and complaints of others in that little inquisitive Company when the unwelcome Note was given about signifying an Adjournment for only Twenty Four Hours  The Colour of a young Woman there came and went a Hundred times if possible in the space of Two Minutes she blush'd like a red Rose this Moment and in the switch of an Eyelash she was all over as pale as a white one The Suiter whose Name her Heart had gone pit a pat for the space of an Hour to be inform'd of from the Pen of a Seer was now deferr'd a whole Day longer she was once or twice within an ace of swooning away but he comforted her in particular by telling her though he said it only by way of  jest that the Day following would be a more lucky Day to consult about Husbands than the present that she came on The Answer was a kind of Cordial to her hopes and brought her a little better to herself  Two others I remember Sisters and old Maids that it seems were Misers Women ordinarily drest and in blue Aprons and yet by relation worth no less than Two Thousand Pounds each were in a peck of Troubles about his going and leaving them unsatisfied They came upon an enquiry after Goods that were stolen and they complained that by next Morning at that time the Thief might be got far enough off and creep into so remote a corner that he would put it beyond the power of the Devil and the art of Conjuration to find him out and bring him back again The disturbance and anxiety that was to be seen in their Conntenances was just like that which is to be beheld in the Face of a great losing Gamester when his all his last great Stake lies upon the Table and is just sweeping off by another winning Hand into his own Hat  The next was a Widow who boune'd because as she pretended he would not tell her what was best to do with her Sons and what Profession it would be most happy for them to be put to but in reality all the Cause of the Widow's fuming and fretting was not that she wanted to provide for her  Sons but for herself she wanted a Second Husband and was not half so solicitous about being put in a way of educating those Children she had already as of knowing when she should be in a likelyhood of getting more This was certainly in her Thoughts or else she would never have flounc'd about in her Weed from one end of the Room to the other and all the while of her Passion smile by Fits upon the Merchant and leer upon a young pretty  Irish  Fellow that was there The young  Irishman  made use of a little Eyelanguage She grew appeas'd went away in quite a good humour skutled too airily down Stairs for a Woman in her cloaths and the reason was certainly that she knew the matter before which we took notice of presently after The  Irishman  went precipitately after her down Stairs without taking his leave  But neither were the Two Misers for their Gold the Virgin for a first Husband nor the Widow for a Second half so eager as another married Woman there was for the death of her Spouse She had put the Question in so expecting a manner for a lucky Answer and with so much keen desire appearing plainly in her looks that no big belly'd Woman was ever more eager for devouring Fruit no young hasty Bridegroom just married to a Beauty more impatient for Night and Enjoyment than she was to know what she thought a more happy Moment the Moment  of her Husband's last agonizing Gasp As her Expectation was the greatest so was her Disappointment too and consequently her Disorder upon his going and leaving her unresolv'd She was frantick raging and implacable she was in such a Fury at the delay of putting off her Answer to the Day following that in her fury she acted as if she would have given herself an Answer which of the Two should die first by choaking herself upon the spot with the Indignation that swell'd in her Stomach and rose into her Throat on that occasion It may look like a Romance to say it but indeed they were forc'd to cut her Lace and then she threw out of the Room with great PassionBut yet had so much of the enraged Wife left beyond the enrag'd Woman as to return instantly up Stairs and signify very calmly she would be certain to be there next Day and beseech'd earnestly that she might not meet with a Second Disappointment  All this hurry and bustle created a stay a little too tedious for the Merchant who began to be impatient himself especially when Word was brought up that a fresh Company was come in But Mr  Campbell  was deny'd to them and to put a stop to any more Interruptions the Merchant and the dumb Gentleman agreed to slip into a Coach drive to a Tavern in the City and settle matters of Futurity over a Bottle of  French  Claret  The first Thing done at the Tavern was Mr  Campbell  's saluting him upon a piece of Paper by his Name and drinking his Health The next Paper held a Discourse of condoleance for a Disaster that was past long since namely a great and considerable loss that happen'd to his Family in the dreadful Conflagration of the City of  London  In the Third little Dialogue which they had together he told the Merchant that Losses and Advantages were general Topicks which a Person unskill'd in that Art might venture to assign to any Man of his Profession it being next to impossible that Persons who traffick should not sometimes gain and sometimes loseBut said Mr  Duncan Campbell  I will sketch out particularly and specify to you some future Misfortunes with which you will unavoidably meet 'Tis in your Stars it is in Destiny that you should have some Trials and therefore when you are forewarn'd take a prudent care to beforearm'd with Patience and by longanimity and meekly and resignedly enduring your Lot render it more easy since Impatience can't avert it and will only render it more burthensome and heavy He gave these Words to the Merchant who press'd for his Opinion that Moment By your leave resuming the Pen said the Dumb Gentleman in writing we will have this Bottle out first and tap a fresh one that you may be warm'd with Courage enough to receive  the first Speculative onsett of ill fortune that I shall predict to you with a good grace and that may perhaps enable you to meet it when it comes to reduce it self into action with a manful Purpose and all becoming Resolution The Merchant agreed to the Proposal and put on an Air of the careless and indifferent as well as he could to signify that he had no need to raise up an artificial Courage from the auxiliary forces of the Grape But Nature when hard press'd will break thro' all disguises and not only notwithstanding the Air of Pleasantry he gave himself which appear'd forced and constrain'd but in spite of Two or Three sparkling and enlivening Bumpers a Cloud of Care would ever and anon gather and shoot heavily cross his Brow tho' he labour'd all he could to dispel it as quickly and to keep fair Weather in his Countenance Well they had crack'd the first Bottle and the Second succeeded upon the Table and they call'd to blow a Pipe together This Pipe Mr  Campbell  found had a very ill Effect It is certainly a pensive kind of Instrument and fills a Mind any thing so disposed with disturbing thoughts black fumes and melancholy vapours as certainly as it doth the Mouth with smoke It plainly took away even the little Sparks of Vivacity which the Wine had given before so he wrote for a truce of firing those sort of noxious Guns any longer and they laid down their Arms by consent and  drank off the Second Bottle A Third immediately supply'd its place and at the first Glass the opening of the Bottle Mr  Campbell  began to open to him his future case in the following Words Sir you have now some Ventures at Sea from such and such a Place to such a value Don't he discomforted at the News which you certainly will have within three Months but 'twill be false at last that they are by three different Tempests made the Prey of the great Ocean and enrich the Bottom of the Sea the Palace of  Neptune  A worse Storm than all these attends you at home a Wife who is and will be more the Tempest of the House wherein she lives The high and lofty Winds of her Vanity will blow down the Pillars of your House and Family the Hightide of her Extravagance will roll on like a resistless Torrent and leave you at low Water and the Ebb of all your Fortunes This is the Highest and the most cutting Disaster that is to befal you your real Shipwreck is not foreign but domestick your bosom Friend is to be your greatest Foe and even your powerful Undoer for a time mark what I say and take Courage it shall be but for a time provided you take Courage it will upon that condition be only a short and wholesome taste of Adversity given to you that you may relish returning Prosperity with Virtue and with a greater Return of thanks to him that dispenses it at pleasure to Mankind  Remember Courage and Resignation is what I advise you to use it as becomes you in your Adversity and believe that as I foretold that Adversity so I can foretel a Prosperity will again be the consequence of those Virtues and the more you feel the one ought not to cast you down but raise your hopes the more that he who foretold you that so exactly could likewise foretel you the other The Merchant was by this put into a great suspence of Mind but somewhat easier by the Second Prediction being annex'd so kindly to the first fatal one They crown'd the Night with a flask of  Burgundy  and then parting each went to their respective Homes  The Reader may perchance wonder how I who make no mention of my being there as in Truth I was not at the Tavern should be able to relate this as of my own knowledge but if he pleases to have patience to the end of the Story he will have entire satisfaction in that Point  About half a Year after the Merchant came again told him that his Prediction was too far verify'd to his very dear cost and that he was now utterly undone and beyond any visible means of a future recovery and doubting least the other fortunate Part of the Prediction was only told him by way of Encouragement for groundless Doubts and Fears always attend a Mind implung'd in Melancholy besought him very earnestly to tell  him candidly and sincerely if there was no real Prospect of Good and rid him at once of the Uneasiness of such a Suspension of Thought but pray too said he with all the vehemence of repeated Expostulation satisfy me if there are any further hopes on this side the Grave  To this  Duncan Campbell  made a short but a very significant reply in writing May the Heaven's preserve you from a threat'ning danger of Life Take care only of yourself great and mighty care and if you outlive Friday next you will yet be great and more fortunate than ever you was in all the height of your former most flourishing space of Life He colour'd inordinately when  Duncan Campbell  said Friday and conjur'd him to tell him as particularly as he could what he meant by Friday He told him he could not particularize any further but that great Danger threaten'd him that Day and that without extraordinary Precaution it would prove fatal to him even to death He shook his Head and went away in a very sorrowful Plight Friday past Saturday came and on that very Saturday Morning came likewise the joyful Tidings that what Ventures of his were given over for lost at Sea were all come safe into the Harbour He came the Moment he receiv'd those dispatches from his Agent to Mr  Duncan Campbell  's Apartment embrac'd him tenderly and saluted him with  much gladness of Heart before a great Room full of Ladies where I happen'd to be present at that time crying out in a loud Voice before he knew what he said that Mr  Campbell  had sav'd his Life that Friday was his Birthday and he had intended with a Pistol to shoot himself that very Day The Ladies thought him mad and he recover'd from his Exstacy said no more but sate down till Mr  Campbell  dismiss'd all his Clients and then we Three went to the Tavern together where he told me the whole little History or Narrative just as is above related  The Fame which Mr  Duncan Campbell  got by the foregoing and several other Predictions of the like kind was become very large and extensive and had spread itself into the remotest Corners of this Metropolis The Squares rung with it it was whisper'd from one House to another through the more magnificent Streets where Persons of Quality and Distinction reside it catch'd every House in the City like the News of Stock from  Exchangealley  it run noisily through the Lanes and little Thoroughfares where the poor inhabit it was the Chat of the Teatable and the Babble of the Streets and the whole Town from the top to the bottom was full of it Whenever any Reputation rises to a degree like this let it be for what Art or Accomplishment or on what account soever it will Malice Envy and Detraction are sure  to be the immediate Pursuers of it with full Mouth and to hunt it down if possible with full Cry Even the great  Nostradamus  tho' favour'd by Kings and Queens which always without any other reason creates Enemies was not more pursued by Envy and Detraction for his Predictions in  Paris  and throughout  France  than our  Duncan Campbell  was in  London  and even throughout  England  Various different and many were the Objections rais'd to blot his Character and extenuate his Fame that when one was confuted another might not be wanting to supply its place and so to maintain a course and series of backbiting according to the known Maxim  Throw dirt and if it does not stick throw dirt continually and some will stick  Neither is there any wonder for a Man that has got Applauders of all sorts and conditions must expect Condemners and Detractors of all sorts and conditions likewise If a Lady of high Degree for example should say smiling though really thinking absolutely what she says for fear of being thought overcredulousWell I vow some things Mr  Campbell  does are surprizing after all they would be apt to incline one to a belief that he is a wonder of a Man for one would imagin the things he does impossiblewhy then a Prude with an assumed supercilious Air and a scornful  Tihee  would in order to seem more wise than she was reply Laud  Madam 'tis more a wonder to me that you can be imposed upon soI vow to Gad Madam I would assoon consult an Almanackmaker and pin my Faith upon what he pricks down or believe like my Creed in the cross which I make upon the Hand of a  Gypsie  Lard Madam I assure your La'ship he knows no more than I do of youI assure you so and therefore believe meHe has it all by hearsayIf the Lady that believ'd it should reply that if he had notice of every Stranger by hearsay he must be a greater Man than she suspected and must keep more Spies in pay than a Prime Minister The  Prude  's Answer would be with a  loud Laugh  and giggling out these WordsLard Madam I assure you nothing can be more easy and so take it for granted Because she was inclin'd to say so and had the act of Wisdom on her side forsooth that she appear'd hard of belief which some call hard to be put upon and the other Lady credulous which some though believing upon good grounds are call'd and so thought foolish the Prude's Answer would be thought sufficient and convincing  Thus Malice and Folly by dint of Noise and Impudence and strong though empty Assertions often run down Modesty and good Sense Among the common People it is the same but only done in a different manner For Example an ordinary Person that had  consulted might say as he walk'd along There goes the dumb Gentleman who writes down any Name of a Stranger at first Sight Steps up a blunt Fellow that takes Stubborness for Sense and saysthat is a confounded Lye he is a Cheat and an Impostor and you are one of his Accomplices He'll tell me my Name I suppose if you tell it him first He is no more dumb than I am he can speak and hear as well as us I have been with those that say they have heard him I wish I and Two or Three more had him in our Stable and I warrant you with our Cartwhips we would lick some Words out of his Chops as dumb as you call himI tell you 'tis all a Lye and all a BiteIf the other desires to be convinc'd for himself by his own ExperienceThe rougher Rogue who perhaps has stronger Sinews than t'other answers if you lye any further I will knock you down and so he is the vulgar Wit and the Mouth of the Rabblerout and thus the Detraction spreads below with very good success as it does above in another kind  As there are Two comical Adventures in his Life which directly suit and correspond with the foregoing Reflections this seems the most proper Place to insert them in The first consists of a kind of Mobbway of Usage he met with from a Fellow who got to be an Officer in the Army but by the following Behaviour will be found unworthy of the Name and the Commission  In the Year a Lady of good Quality came and address'd herself to him much after the following manner She told him she had Choice of Lovers but preferr'd one above the rest but desir'd to know his Name and if she made him her Choice what would be the subsequent Fate of such a Matrimony Mr  Duncan Campbell  very readily gave her down in writing this plain and honest Reply that of all her Suiters she was most inclin'd to a Captain a distinguish'd Officer and a great Beau naming his Name and one that had a great many outward engaging Charms sufficient to blind the Eyes of any Lady that was not thoroughly acquainted with his Manner of living He therefore assured her and thought himself bound being conjured so to do having received his Fee though there was Danger in such plain and open Predictions that he was a Villain and a Rogue in his Heart a profligate Gamester and that if she took him to her Bed she would only embrace her own Ruin The Lady's Woman who was present being in Fee with the Captain resolving to give Intelligence for fear the Officer her so good Friend should be disappointed in the Siege slily shuffled the Papers into her Pocket and made a Present of them to the military Spark Fir'd with Indignation at the Contents he vow'd Revenge and in order to compass it conspires with his female Spy about the Means  In fine for fear of losing the Lady though he quarrel'd with  Duncan Campbell  a Method was to be found out how to secure her by the very Act of Revenge At last it was resolv'd to discover to her that he had found out what she had been told by Mr  Campbell  but the Way how he had been inform'd was to remain a Secret He did do so and ended his Discovery with these Words I desire Madam that if I prove him an Impostor you would not believe a Word he saysThe Lady agreed to so fair a ProposalThen the Captain swore that he himself would never eat a Piece of Bread more till he had made Mr  Campbell  eat his Words nay he insisted upon it that he would bring him to his Tongue and make him own by Word of Mouth that what he had written before was false and calumnious To which the Lady answer'd again that if he perform'd what he said she would be convinced This brave military Man however not relying upon his own single Valour and Prowess to bring about so miraculous a thing as the making a Person that was dumb to speak He took with him for this End three lusty Assistants to combine with him in the Assassination The Ambuscade was settled to be at the Five Bells Tavern in  Witchstreet  in the  Strand  After the Ambush was settled with so much false Courage the Business of decoying Mr  Campbell  into it was not practicable any other way  than by sending out false Colours The Lady's Woman who was by her own Interest tied fast to the Interest of the Beau was to play the trick of  Dalila  and betray this deaf and dumb  Sampson  as he will appear to be a kind of one in the sequel of the Story into the Hands of these  Philistines  She smooths her Face over with a complimenting Lye from her Mistress to Mr  Campbell  and acted her Part of Deceit so well that he promis'd to follow her to the Five Bells with all haste and so she skuttled back to prepare the Captain and to tell him how lucky she was in Mischief and how she drew him out by Smiles into Perdition The short of the Story is when they got him in among them they endeavour'd to assassinate him but they miss'd of their Aim yet 'tis certain they lest him in a very terrible and bloody Condition and the Captain went away in as bad a Plight as the Person was left in whom he assaulted so cowardly with Numbers and to such Disadvantage I was sent for to him upon this Disaster and the Story was deliver'd to me thus by one of the Drawers of the Tavern when I inquir'd into it They began to banter him and speaking to him as if he heard ask'd him if he knew his own Fortune they told him it was to be beaten to Death This was an odd way of addressing a deaf and dumb Man They added they would make him speak before they had done The Boy  seeing he made no Reply but only smiled thought what pass'd between them was a Jest with an old Acquaintance and withdrew about his Business The Door being fasten'd however before they began the honourable Attack they vouchsafed to write down their Intent in the Words abovementioned which they had uttered before to make sure that he should understand their meaning and what this odd way of Correction was for All the while the Maid who had brought him into it was peeping through a Hole and watching the Event as appears afterwards Mr  Campbell  wrote them the following Answer  viz  that he hop'd for fair Play that he unders  d  Be  rgarden  as well as they but if a Gentleman was amongst them he would expect gentlemanly Usage The Rejoinder they made to this consisted it seems not of Words but of Action The Officer in Conjunction with another Ruffian one of the strongest of the Three he had brought commenced the Assault As good luck would have it he warded off their first Blows it seems with tolerable Success and a Winequartpot standing upon the Table  Duncan  took to his Arms and at Two or Three quick Blows well manag'd and close laid in upon the Assailants fell'd them both to the Ground Here it was that the Maid discover'd her Knowledge of it and Privity to the Plot to the whole House for the no sooner sees the  famous Leader the valiant Captain lie sprauling on the Floor with bleeding Temples but she shriek'd out with all the Voice she could exert Murder Murder Murder Alarm'd at this Outcry the Master and all the Attendants of the Tavern scamper'd up Stairs burst into the Room and found  Duncan Campbell  struggling with the other Two and the Quartpot still fast clench'd in his Hand which they were endeavouring to wrench from him The Drawers rescu'd him out of their Hands and inquir'd into the Matter The Maid in a fright confess'd the whole Thing The Officer and his Associate rub'd their Eyes as recovering from a stunning Sleep reel'd as they went to rise paid the Reckoning and slunk pitifully away or as the Rakes Term for it is they brush'd off and for all their Odds had the worst of the Lay I who had some Authority with Mr  Campbell  by reason of my Years and the strict Acquaintance I had with his Mother when I came and found him in that pickle and had the whole Relation told me by the People of the House though I could not forbear pitying him within my own Mind took upon me to reprehend him and told him that these Hardships would by Providence be daily permitted to fall upon him for he met with them Twenty Times while he continued in that irregular way of Living and spending his Time that might be so precious to himself  and many others in Drunkenness and Debauchery and I think the Lessons I wrote down to him upon that Head though a little severe just at that juncture were notwithstanding well tim'd and did as I guess'd they would make a more solid Impression in him than at any other In all these Scuffles whether it is that being deaf and dumb an Affront works deeper upon a Man and so renders him far more fierce or resolute it must be said that though Nature has been kind in making him very Strong Robust and Active with all yet he has bore some Shocks one would imagin beyond the Strength of a Man having sometimes got the better of Five or Six Russians in Rencounters of the like kind  The next Banter he met with was in a gentler way from an unbelieving Lady and yet she came off with very ill success and the Banter turn'd all upon herself in the End  A Lady of Distinction whose Name shall therefore be conceal'd in this Place came with Two or Three of her special Friends who took her for the most merry innocent spotless Virgin upon Earth and whose Modesty was never suspected in the least by her Relations or Servants that were nearest about here after having rally'd Mr  Campbell  several frivolous Questions doubting his  and vexing and teazing him with  beyond all Patience was  by him told that he did not take Fees in his Profession to be made a Jest of like a common Fortuneteller but to do real Good to those who consulted him as far as he was able by his Predictions that he was treated with more Respect by Persons of a higher Condition though her own was very good and so offer'd her Guinea back again with a Bow and a Smile She had a little more Generosity of Spirit than not to be a little nettled at the Proffer she had caus'd by so coarse an Usage She affected appearing grave a little and told him she would be serious for the future and ask'd him to set down her Name which she had neglected before to ask other Questions that were nothing to the purpose He promis'd to write it down but pausing a little longer than ordinary about it she return'd to her former way of uncivil Merriment and ungallant Raillery She repeated to him in Three or Four little scraps of Paper one after another as fast as she could write them the same Words  viz  That he could not tell her Name nor whether she was Maid Wife or Widow and laugh'd as if she would split her Sides triumphing to the rest of her Companions over his Ignorance and her own Wit as if she had pos'd him and put him to an entire Stand But see what this overweening Opinion of Security ended in The Man of the Second Sight was not to be so easily baffled Vex'd at being so disturb'd and coming  out of his brown Study he reaches the Paper and begins to writeNow it was the Lady's turn to suffer she had deserv'd hearty Punishment and it came into her Hands with the Note to a degree of Severity as you will perceive by the Contents of it just nowShe read it and swooning away drop'd from her Chair The whole Room being in a bustle I that was in the outward Chamber ran in While Mr  Campbell  was sprinkling Water in her Face a Lady snatch'd up the Note to read it at which he seem'd mightily displeas'd I therefore who understood his Signs recover'd it out of her Hands by Stratagem and ran to burn it which I did so quick that I was not discover'd in the Curiosity which I must own I satisfied myself in by reading it first a Curiosity rais'd too high by so particular an Adventure to be overcome in so little a Time of Thought as I was to keep it in my Hands and so I came by the knowledge of it myself without being inform'd by Mr  Campbell  This shews how a sudden Curiosity when there is not Time given to think and correct it may overcome a Man as well as a Woman for I was never overcurious in my Life and though I was pleas'd with the Oddness of the Adventure I often blush'd to myself since for the unmanly Weakness of not being able to step with a Note from one Room to another to the Fireside without peeping into the Contents of it  The Contents of it were these Madam since you provoke me your Name isYou are no Widow you are no Wife and yet you are no Maid you have a Child at Nurse at such a Place by such a Gentleman and you were brought to Bed in  Leicestershire  The Lady convinc'd by this Answer of his strange and mystical Power and pleas'd with his Civility in endeavouring to conceal from others the Secret after so many repeated Provocations though she shew'd great Disorder for that Day became one of his constant Attenders some time after and would not take any Step in her Affairs without his Advice which she often has said since she found very much to her Advantage She was as serious in her dealings with him afterwards and improv'd by being so as she was gay and turbulent with him before and smarted for it In fine she was a thorough Convert and a Votary of his and the only Jest she us'd afterwards to make concerning him was a civil Witticism to his Wife to whom she was wont every now and then smiling to address herself after this manner Your Husband Madam is a Devil but he is a very handsome and a very civil one  Not long after this came another Lady with a like intent to impose upon him and was resolv'd as she own'd to have laugh'd him to scorn if she had succeeded in her Attempt She had very dexterously dress'd her  self in her Woman's Habit and her Woman in her own her Footman  squired  the new made Lady in a very gentlemanly Dress hir'd for that purpose of a disguise from  Monmouthstreet  The strange and unknown Masqueraders enter'd Mr  Campbell  's Room with much Art The Fellow was by Nature of a clean Make and had a good Look and from following a genteel Master when he was young copy'd his Gait a little and had some Appearance of a Mien and a tolerable good Air about him But this being the first time of his being so fine and he a little vain in his Temper he overacted his Part he strutted too much he was as fond of his Ruffles his Watch his Sword his Cane and his Snuffbox as a Boy of being newly put into Breeches and view'd 'em all too often to be thought the Possessor of any such things long The Affectation of the Chambermaid was insufferable She had the Toss of the Head the Jut of the Bum the sidelong Leer of the Eye the imperious Look upon her Lady now degraded into her Woman that she was intolerable and a Person without the Gift of the Second Sight would have guess'd her to have been a pragmatical Upstart tho' 'tis very probable that during that time she fancy'd herself really better than her Mistress The Mistress acted her Part of Maid the best for it is easier for genteel Modesty to act a low Part than for affected Vanity to act a high one She  kept her distance like a Servant but would to disguise things the better be every now and then pert according to their Way and give Occasion to be chid But there is an Air of Gentility inborn and inbred to some People and even when they aim to be awkward a certain Grace will attend all their minutest Actions and Gestures and command Love Respect and Veneration I must therefore own that there was not need of a Man's being a Conjurer to guess who ought to be the Lady and who the Maid but to know who absolutely was the Lady and who was the Maid did require that Skill For how many such real Ladies have we that are made so from such Upstarts and how many genteel waiting Women of great Descent that are born with a Grace about them and are bred to good Manners Mr  Campbell  's Art made him positive in the Case he took the Patches from the Face of the Maid and plac'd them on the Mistrisses he pull'd of her Hood and Scarf and gave it the Lady and taking from the Lady her Ridinghood gave it the Maid in exchange for Ladies at that time of Day were not enter'd into that Fashion of cloaking themselves Then he wrote down that he should go out and ought to send his Maid in to undress them quite and give the Mistriss her own Cloaths and the Maid hers and with a Smile wrote down both their Names and commended her contrivance but  after that it was remark'd by the Lady that he pay'd her less Respect than she expected and more to her Footman who was in Gentleman's Habit whom he took by his Side and told a great many fine things whereas he would tell the Lady nothing further The Lady nettled at this wrote to him that she had Vanity enough to believe that she might be distinguish'd from her Maid in any Dress but that he had shown his want of Skill in not knowing who that Gentleman was Mr  Campbell  told her her mistake in sharp Terms and begging her pardon assured her he knew several Chambermaids as genteel and as wellborn as her and many Mistresses more aukward and worseborn than her Maid that he did not go therefore by the Rule of guess and judging what ought to be but by the Rule of Certainty and the Knowledge of what actually was She however unsatisfy'd with that Answer perplex'd him mightily to know who the Man was He answer'd he would be a great ManThe Lady laugh'd scornfully and said she wanted to know who he was not what he would beHe answer'd againHe was her Footman but that she would have a worseShe grew warm and desired to be inform'd why since he knew the Fellow's Condition he respected her to little and him so much and accused him of want of practising Manners if he had not went of Knowledge He answer'd Madam  since you will be asking Questions too farThis Footman will advance himself to the Degree of a Gentleman and have a Woman of Distinction to his Wife while you will degrade yourself by a Marriage to be the Wife of a Footman His Ambition is laudable your Condescension mean therefore I give him the Preference I have given you fair warning and wholesome advice you may avoid your Lot by Prudence but his will certainly be what I tell you  This coming afterwards to pass exactly as was predicted and his disappointing so many that had a mind to impose upon him has render'd him pretty free from such wily Contrivances since though now and then they have happen'd but still to the mortification and disappointment of the Contrivers But as we have not pretended to say with regard to these things that he has his  Genius  always at his Elbow or his Beck to whisper in his Ear the Names of Persons and such little constant Events as these so that we may not be deemed to give a fabulous Account of his Life and Adventures we think ourselves bound to give the Reader an insight into the particular Power and Capacity which he has for bringing about these particular Performances especially that of writing down Names of Strangers at first Sight which I don't doubt will be done to the satisfaction of all  Persons who shall read the succeeding Chapter concerning the Gift of the Second Sight  CHAP VII Concerning the Second Sight  MR  Martin  lately publish'd a Book intituled  A Description of the Western Isles of  Scotland  called by the Ancient Geographers Hebrides  It contains many  curious  Particulars relating to the natural and civil History of those  Islands  with a Map of them and in his Preface he tells us that perhaps it's  Peculiar  to those  Isles  that they have never been described till now by any Man that was a Native of the Country or had travell'd them as himself has done and in the Conclusion of the said Preface he tells us he has given here such an Account of the  Second Sight  as the  nature  of the  thing  will  bear  which has always been reckon'd  sufficient  among the  unbyass'd  Part of Mankind but for  those  that will  not  be  satisfy'd  they ought to  oblige  us with a  new Scheme  by which we may  judge  of  Matters of Fact  The  chief Particulars  he has given us concerning the  Second Sight  are here set down by way of Abstract or Epitome that they may not be too tedious to the Reader  In the Second Sight the  Vision  makes such a  lively Impression  on the  Seers  that they neither  see  nor  think  of  any thing else  but the  Vision  as long as it continues And then they appear  Pensive  or  Jovial  according to the  Object  which was presented to them  At the Sight of a Vision the Eyelids of the Person are erected and the Eyes continue staring till the Object vanish as has often been observ'd by the Author and others present  There is one in  Skye  an Acquaintance of whom observ'd that when he sees a Vision the inner Part of his Eylids turns so far upwards that after the Object disappenrs he must draw them down with his Fingers and sometimes employs others to draw them down which he finds to be much the easier way  The Faculty of the  Second Sight  does not lineally descend in a Family as some imagin for he knows several Parents that are endow'd with it but not their Children and so on the contrary Neither is it acquir'd by any previous Compact and after a strict Enquiry he could never learn from any among them that this Faculty was communicable any way whatsoever  Note  That this Account is differing from the Account that is given by Mr  Aubrey  a Gentleman of the  Royal Society  and I think Mr  Martin  's Reason here against the Descent  of this Faculty from Parents to Children is not generally conclusive For tho' he may know Parents endow'd with it and not Children and so  vice versâ  yet there may be Parents who are endow'd with it being qualify'd as Mr  Aubrey  has said  viz  both being Second Sighted or even  one  to an  extraordinary  Degree whose Children may have it by descent And as to this Faculty's being any otherways communicable since the Accounts differ I must leave it to a further Examination  The  Seer  knows neither the Object Time nor Place of a Vision before it appears and the same Object is often seen by different Persons living at a considerable distance from one another The true Way of judging as to the Time and Circumstance of an Object is by Observation for several Persons of Judgement without this Faculty are more capable to judge of the Design of a Vision than a Novice that is a  Seer  As an Object appears in the Day or Night it will come to pass sooner or later accordingly  If an Object be seen early in the Morning which is not frequent it will be accomplish'd in a few Hours afterwards If at Noon it will commonly be accomplish'd that very Day If in the Evening perhaps that Night if after Candles be lighted it will be accomplish'd that Night It's later always in Accomplishment by Weeks Months and sometimes  Years according to the Time of the Night the Vision is seen  When a Shroud is perceiv'd about one it's a sure Prognostick of Death the Time is judg'd according to the Height of it about the Person for if it be not seen above the Middle Death is not to be expected for the space of a Year and perhaps some Months longer and as it is frequently seen to ascend higher towards the Head Death is concluded to be at hand in a few Days if not Hours as daily Experience confirms Examples of this kind were shown the Author when the Persons of whom the Observations were made enjoy'd perfect Health  There was one Instance lately of a Prediction of this kind by a  Seer  that was a Novice concerning the Death of one of the Author's Acquaintance this was communicated to a few only and with great Confidence The Author being one of the Number did not in the least regard it till the Death of the Person about the Time foretold confirm'd to him the certainty of the Prediction The foresaid  Novice  is now a  skilful Seer  as appears from many late Instances He lives in the Parish of St  Mary  's the most Northern in  Skye  If a Woman be seen standing at a Man's left Hand it's a Presage that she will be his Wife whether they are married to others or unmarried at the Time of the Apparition  If Two or Three Women are seen at once standing near a Man's left Hand she that is next him will undoubtedly be his Wife first and so on whether all Three or the Man be single or married at the Time of the Vision of which there are several late Instances of the Author's Acquaintance It's an ordinary thing for them to see a Man that is to come to the House shortly after and tho' he be not of the  Seers  Acquaintance yet he not only tells his Name but gives such a lively Description of his Stature Complexion Habit  c  that upon his Arrival he answers the Character given of him in all respects If the Person so appearing be one of the  Seer  's Acquaintaince he can tell by his Countenance whether he comes in good or bad Humour The Author has been seen thus by  Seers  of both Sexes at some Hundreds of Miles Distance Some that saw him in this manner had never seen him personally and it happen'd according to their Visions without any previous Design of his to go to those Places his coming there being purely accidental and in the Nineteenth Page of his Book he tells us that Mr  Daniel Morrison  a Minister told him that upon his landing in the Island  Rona  the Natives receiv'd him very affectionately and addressed themselves to him with this Salutation God save you Pilgrim You are heartily welcome here for we have had repeated Apparitions of your Person amongst  us  viz  after the manner of the  Second Sight  It's ordinary with them to see Houses Gardens and Trees in Places void of all Three and this in process of Time uses to be accomplish'd of which he gives an Instance in the  Island of Skye  To see a Spark of Fire fall upon one's Arm or Breast is a Forerunner of a dead Child to be seen in the Arms of those Persons of which there are several fresh Instances  To see a Seat empty at the time of one's sitting in it is a Presage of that Person's Death quickly after  When a Novice or one that has lately obtain'd the  Second Sight  sees a Vision in the Nighttime without Doors and comes near a Fire he presently falls into a Swoon  Some find themselves as it were in a Croud of People having a Corpse which they carry along with them and after such Visions the  Seers  come in sweating and describe the People that appear'd if there are any of their Acquaintance among them they give an Account of their Names and also of the Bearers But they know nothing concerning the Corpse  All those that have the  Second Sight  do not always see these Visions at once though they are together at the Time but if one who has this Faculty designedly touch his  fellow Seer  at the Instant of a Vision's appearing then the  Second  sees it as well as the  First  There is the way of foretelling Death by a  Cry  that they call  Taisk  which some call a  Wrath  in the  Lowland  They hear a  loud Cry  without Doors exactly resembling the Voice of some particular Person whose Death is foretold by it of which he gives a late Instance which happen'd in the Village  Rigg  in  Skye Isle  Things are also foretold by  smelling  sometimes as follows Fish or Flesh is frequently smelt in the Fire when at the same Time neither of the Two are in the House or in any probability like to be had in it for some Weeks or Months This Smell several Persons have who are endued with the  Second Sight  and it's always accomplish'd soon after    Children Horses  and  Cows  have the  Second Sight  as well as Men and Women advanc'd in Years  That  Children  see it it is plain from their  crying  aloud at the very Instant that a Corpse or any other Vision appears to an ordinary  Seer  Of which he gives an Instance in a Child when himself was present  That  Horses  likewise see it's very plain from their violent and sudden starting when the Rider or  Seer  in Company with them sees a Vision of any kind by Night or Day It's  observable of a Horse that he will not go forward that way till he be led about at some distance from the common Road and then he is in a Sweat He gives an Instance of this in a Horse in the Isle of  Skye  That  Cows  have the  Second Sight  appears from this that if a Woman milking a  Cow  happens to see a Vision by the  Second Sight  the  Cow  runs away in a great fright at the same time and will not be pacify'd for some time after  In Reference to this  Paracelsus Tom    l de arte presagâ  writes thus  'Horses also have their Auguries who perceive by their  Sight  and  Smell  wandering  Spirits Witches  and  Spectres  and the like Things and Dogs both see and hear the same'  Here in the next place the Author answers Objections that have lately been made against the  Reality  of the  Second Sight  First  It's objected that these  Seers  are  visionary  and  melancholy  People who  fancy  they  see  Things that do  not  appear to  them  or  any Body else  He answers The  People  of these  Isles  and  particularly  the  Seers  are very Temperate and their Diet is simple and moderate in Quantity and Quality so that their Brains are not in all probability disordered by undigested Fumes of Meat or Drink Both Sexes are free from Hysterick Fits Convulsions and several other Distempers of that  Sort There are no Madmen among them nor any Instance of Selfmurther It's observed among them that a Man  drunk  never has a Vision of the  Second Sight  and he that is a  Visionary  would discover himself in other things as well as in that nor are such as have the  Second Sight  judg'd to be  Visionaries  by any of their Friends or Acquaintaince  Secondly  It's objected that there are none among the Learned able to oblige the World with a satisfactory Account of these Visions therefore they are not to be believed  He answers If every Thing of which the  Learned  are  not able  to give a satisfactory Account shall be  condemn'd  as  False  and  Impossible  we shall find  many  other Things  generally believ'd  which must be  rejected  as  such  Thirdly  It's objected that the  Seers  are Impostors and the People who believe them are credulous and easy to be impos'd upon  He answers The  Seers  are generally illiterate and wellmeaning People and altogether void of Design nor could he ever learn that any of them made the least gain of it neither is it reputable among them to have that Faculty Beside the People of the Isles are not so credulous as to believe an Impossibility before the thing foretold be accomplish'd but when it actually comes to pass afterwards it is not in their Power to deny it without offering Violence to their Senses and Reason Beside if the  Seers  were  Deceivers  can it be reasonable to imagin that all the  Islanders  who have not the  Second Sight  should combine together and offer Violence to their Understandings and Senses to force themselves to believe a Lye from Age to Age There are several Persons among them whose Birth and Education raise them above the Suspicion of concurring with an Imposture merely to gratify an illiterate and contemptible sort of Persons Nor can a reasonable Man believe that  Children Horses  and  Cows  could be engaged in a Combination to perswade the World of the  Reality  of a  Second Sight  Every Vision that is seen comes exactly to pass according to the rules of Observation though Novices and heedless Persons do not always judge by those Rules concerning which he gives Instances  There are Visions seen by several Persons in whose Days they are not accomplish'd and this is one of the Reasons why some Things have been seen that are said never to have come to pass and there are also several Visions seen which are not understood till they are accomplish'd  The  Second Sight  is not a late Discovery seen by one or two in a Corner or a remote  Isle  but it's seen by many Persons of both Sexes in several Isles separated about Forty or Fifty Leagues from one another The Inhabitants of many of these Isles never had  the least Converse by Word or Writing And this Faculty of seeing Visions having continued as we are inform'd by Tradition ever since the Plantation of these  Isles  without being disproved by the nicest Sceptick after the strictest Inquiry seems to be a clear Proof of its Reality  It's observable that it was much more common Twenty or Thirty Years ago than at present for One in Ten does not see it now that saw it then  The  Second Sight  is not confin'd to the  Western Isles  alone the Author having an Account that it's in several Parts of  Holland  but particularly in  Bommel  where a Woman has it for which she is courted by some and dreaded by others She sees a Smoak about one's Face which is the forerunner of the death of a Person so seen and she actually foretold the deaths of several that lived there She was living in that Town a few Winters ago  The  Second Sight  is likewise in  the Isle of Man  as appears by this Instance Captain  Leathes  the chief Commander of  Bellfast  in his Voyage lost Thirteen Men by a violent Storm and upon his landing in the  Isle of Man  an ancient Man Clerk to a Parish there told him immediately that he had lost Thirteen Men there the Captain enquired how he came to the Knowledge of that he answer'd that it was by  Thirteen Lights  which  he had seen come into the Churchyard as Mr  Sacheverel  tells us in his late Description of the  Isle of Man  Note that this is like the Sight of the  Corpsecandles  in  Wales  which is also well attested  Here the Author adds  many  other Instances concerning the  Second Sight  of which I shall set down only a  few  A Man in  Knockow  in the Parish of St  Mary  's the northermost Part of  Skye  being in perfect Health and sitting with his fellow Servants at Night was on a sudden taken ill drop'd from his Seat backward and then fell a vomiting at which the Family was much concern'd he having never been subject to the like before but he came to himself soon after and had no sort of Pain about him One of the Family who was accustomed to see the  Second Sight  told them that the Man's Illness proceeded from a very strange Cause which was thus An illnatur'd Woman whom he named who lives in the next adjacent Village of  Bornskittag  came before him in a very angry and furious Manner her Countenance full of Passion and her Mouth full of Reproaches and threaten'd him with her Head and Hands till he fell over as you have seen him This Woman had a Fancy for the Man but was like to be disappointed as to her marrying of him This Instance was told the Author by the Master of the  Family and others who were present when it happen'd  Sir  Norman Macklead  and some others playing at  Tables  at a Game called in  Irish Falmermore  wherein there are Three of a Side and each of them throw the Dice by turns there happened to be one difficult Point in the disposing of one of the  Tablemen  This obliged the Gamester to deliberate before he was to change his  Man  since upon the disposing of it the winning or losing of the Game depended at length the Butler who stood behind advised the Player where to place the  Man  with which he comply'd and won the Game This being thought extraordinary and Sir  Norman  hearing one whisper him in the Ear ask'd who advis'd him so skilfully He answer'd it was the Butler but this seem'd more strange for it was generally thought he could not play at Tables Upon this Sir  Norman  ask'd him how long it was since he had learn'd to play And the Fellow own'd that he had never play'd in his Life but that he saw the Spirit  Brownie  a Spirit usually seen in that Country reaching his Arm over the player's Head and touching the Part with his Finger where the Tableman was to be placed This was told the Author by Sir  Norman  and others who happen'd to be present at the Time  Daniel Bow  alias  Black  an Inhabitant of  Bornskittag  who is one of the precisest  Seers  in the Isles foretold the death of a young Woman in  Minginis  within less than Twenty Four Hours before the Time and accordingly she died suddenly in the Fields though at the Time of the Prediction she was in perfect health but the Shrou'd appearing close about her Head was the Ground of his Confidence that her Death was at Hand  The same Person foretold the Death of a Child in his Master's Arms by seeing a Spark of Fire fall on his left Arm and this was likewise accomplish'd soon after the Prediction  Some of the Inhabitants of  Harries  sailing round the  Isle  of  Skye  with a Design to go to the opposite Mainland were strangely surprized with an Apparition of Two Men hanging down by the Ropes that secured the Mast but could not conjecture what it meant they pursued their Voyage but the Wind turning contrary they were forced into  Broadford  in the  Isle  of  Skye  where they found Sir  Donald Mackdonald  keeping a Sherriffs Court and Two Criminals receiving Sentence of Death there The Ropes and Mast of that very Boat were made use of to hang those Criminals This was told the Author by several who had this Instance related to them by the Boat's Crew  Several Persons living in a certain Family told the Author that they had frequently seen Two Men standing at a Gentlewoman's lefthand who was their Master's Daughter  they told the Men's Names and being her Equals it was not doubted but she would be marry'd to one of them and perhaps to the other after the Death of the first Sometime after a Third Man appeared who seemed always to stand nearest to her of the Three but the  Seers  did not know him though they could describe him exactly and within some Months after this Man who was seen last actually came to the House and fully answer'd the Description given of him by those who never saw him but in a Vision and he marry'd the Woman shortly after They live in the  Isle  of  Skye  and both themselves and others confirm'd the Truth of this Instance when the Author saw them  Archibald Mack Donald  of the Parish of St  Mary  's in the  Isle  of  Skye  being reputed famous in his Skill of foretelling things to come by the  Second Sight  happening to be in the Village  Knockow  one Night and before Supper told the Family that he had just then seen the strangest Thing he ever saw in his Life  viz  A Man with an ugly long Cap always shaking his Head but that the strangest of all was a little kind of an Harp which he had with Four Strings only and that it had Two Hart'shorns fix'd in the front of it All that heard this odd Vision fell a laughing at  Archibald  telling him that he was dreaming or had not his Wits about him since he pretended to see a Thing which had no Being  and was not so much as heard of in any Part of the World All this could not alter  Archibald  's Opinion who told them that they must excuse him if he laugh'd at them after the Accomplishment of the Vision  Archibald  returned to his own House and within Three or Four Days after a Man with a Cap Harp  c  came to the House and the Harp Strings Horns and Cap answer'd the Description of them at first View and he shook his Head when he play'd for he had Two Bells fix'd to his Cap This Harper was a poor Man who made himself a Buffoon for his Bread and was never seen before in those Parts and at the Time of the Prediction he was in the  Isle  of  Barray  which is about Twenty Leagues distant from that Part of  Skye  This Relation is vouch'd by Mr  Daniel Martin  and all his Family and such as were then present and they live in the Village where this happened  One  Daniel Nicholson  Minister of St  Mary  's in  Skye  the Parish in which Mr  Archibald Mac Donald  lived told the Author that one Sunday after Sermon at the Chappel  Uge  he took an occasion to inquire of  Archibald  if he still retain'd that unhappy Faculty of seeing the  Second Sight  and wish'd him to get rid of it if possible for said he it's no true Character of a good Man  Archibald  was highly displeas'd and answer'd that he hoped he was no more unhappy than his Neighbours  for seeing what they could not perceive I had said he as serious Thoughts as my Neighbours in time of hearing a Sermon to Day and even then I saw a Corpse laid on the Ground close to the Pulpit and I assure you it will be accomplish'd shortly for it was in the Daytime There were none in the Parish then Sick and few are buried at that little Chappel nay sometimes not one in a Year Yet when Mr  Nicholson  return'd to preach in the said Chappel a Fortnight or three Weeks after he found one buried in the very Spot named by  Archibald  This Story is vouch'd by Mr  Nicholson  the Minister and several of the Parishioners still living  Note  That it's counted by many an Argument of somewhat evil attending this Faculty of the  Second Sight  because there are Instances given of some Persons who have been freed of it upon using some Christian Practices But I shall hereafter show that this Opinion cannot be entirely true  Sir  Norman MacLead  who has his Residence in the  Isle  of  Bernera  which lies between the  Isles  of  N Vist  and  Harries  went to the  Isle  of  Skye  about Business without appointing any Time for his Return his Servants in his Absence being all together in the large Hall at Night one of them who had the  Second Sight  told the rest they must remove for there would be abundance of other Company in the Hall that Night One of  his fellow Servants answered that there was very little Likelyhood of that because of the Darkness of the Night and the Danger of coming through the Rocks that lie round the  Isle  But within an Hour after one of Sir  Norman  's Men came to the House bidding them provide Lights  c  for his Master had newly landed  Sir  Norman  being told of this called for the  Seer  and examin'd him about it He answer'd that he had seen the Spirit  Brownie  in humane Shape come several times and make a show of carrying an old Woman that sate by the Fire to the Door and at last seem'd to carry her out by Neck and Heels which made him laugh heartily and gave occasion to the rest to conclude him Mad to laugh so much without any Reason This Instance was told the Author by Sir  Norman  himself  Four Men from the  Isle  of  Skye  and  Harries  went to  Barbadoes  and staid there some Years who though they had wont to see the  Second Sight  in their native Country never saw it in  Barbadoes  but upon their Return to  England  the first Night after their landing they saw the  Second Sight  as the Author was told by several of their Acquaintaince  John Morrison  who lives in  Bernera  of  Harries  wears the Plant called  Fuga Daemonum  sewed in the Neck of his Coat to prevent his seeing of Visions and says he never saw  any since he first carried that Plant about him  A Spirit by the Country People called  Brownie  was frequently seen in all the most considerable Families in the  Isles  and  North  of  Scotland  in the Shape of a tall Man having very long brown Hair But within these Twenty Years past he has been seen but rarely  There were Spirits also that appeared in the shape of Women Horses Swines Cats and some like fiery Balls which would follow Men in the Fields but there have been but few Instances of these for upwards of Forty Years past  These Spirits us'd also to form Sounds in the Air resembling those of an Harp Pipes crowing of a Cock and of the grinding of Handmills And sometimes Voices have been heard in the Air at Night singing  Irish  Songs the Words of which Songs some of the Author's Acquaintances still retain one of them resembled the Voice of a Woman who died sometime before and the Song related to her State in the other World All these Accounts the Author says he had from Persons of as great Integrity as any are in the World So far Mr  Martin  whose Account is so long that I have given the Reader only a short A bridgement thereof and shall therefore satisfy myself without relating any further Passages by directing the Reader to others also learned  Men who have written on the same Subject  Laurentius Ananias  printed a Volume in  Latin  at  Venice Anno  about the Nature of  Daemons  where in the Third Book he writes concerning the  Second Sight  The learned  Camerarius  does the like and names a Person of his own Acquaintance whom he testifies to have had that Gift St  Austin  himself testifies something not very different from what we now call the Gift of the  Second Sight  of one  Curina  who lived in the Country of  Hippo  in  AfricaBonaysteau  tells us something like it in his  Disc de Excell Dig Hominis  concerning the Spirit of  Hermotimus  So do likewise  Herodotus  and  Maximus Tyrius  about the Spirit of  AristaeusCardan  does the same in his  De rerum variet l    c  of his Kinsman  Baptista Cardan  a Student at  PaviaBaptista Fulgosus  tells us of what we call the  Second Sight  in other Words in his  L    Fact dict memorab c  Among our own Countrymen The Lord  Henry Howard  in the Book he writ against  supposed Prophecies  in his Seventeenth Chapter tells us a wonderful Story of this Kind of  Sight  and sure that noble Lord may be look'd upon as an unexceptionable Testimony in a Story he relates of his own Knowledge he having otherwise little Faith in things of this kind Mr  Cotton Mather  a Minister of  New England  in his Relation of the  Wonders of the invisible World  inserted in his  Ecclesiastical History  of  that Country printed in  London Anno    in Folio  has given us several Instances of this kind as also of many other diabolical Operations Mr  Baxter  's Book concerning the  Certainty of the World of Spirits  has the like Proofs in it Mr  Aubrey  Fellow of the Royal Society has written largely concerning  Second sighted  Persons so has Mr  Beaumont  in his Book of  Genii  and  familiar Spirits  who has collected almost all the other Accounts together and many others whose very Names it would be tedious to recite However as there are a few more Passages very curious in themselves I will venture so far upon the Reader's Patience as not only to recite the Names of the Authors but the Accounts themselves in as succinct and brief a manner as it is possible for any one to do  Mr  Th May  in his History  Lib  writes that an old Man like an Hermit  Second sighted  took his leave of King  James  I when he came into  England  He took little notice of Prince  Henry  but addressing himself to the Duke of  York  since King  Charles  I fell a  weeping  to think what  Misfortunes  he should  undergo  and that  he  should be one of the most  miserable  and most  unhappy  Princes that ever was  A  Scotch  Nobleman sent for one of these  Second sighted  Men out of the  Highlands  to give his Judgment of the then great  George Villiers  Duke of  Buckingham  As soon as ever  he saw him Pish said he  he will come to Nothing I see a Dagger in his Breast  and he was stabb'd in the Breast by Captain  Felton  as has been at large recounted in some of the foregoing Pages  Sir  James Melvin  hath several the like Passages in his History  A certain old Man in  South Wales  told a great Man there of the Fortune of his Family and that there should not be a Third  Male  Generation It has fallen out accordingly  Sir  William Dugdale  with his own Mouth inform'd several Gentlemen that Major General Middleton since Lord went into the  Highlands  of  Scotland  to endeavour to make a Party for King  Charles  I An old Gentleman that was  Second sighted  came and told him that his Endeavour was good but he would be unsuccessful and moreover  That they would put the King to death And that several other Attempts would be made but all in vain But that his Son would come in but not reign in a long Time But would at last be restored  This Lord  Middleton  had a great Friendship with the Laird  Bocconi  and they made an Agreement that the first of them that died should appear to the other in Extremity The Lord  Middleton  was taken Prisoner at  Worcester  Fight and was Prisoner in the Tower of  London  under Three Locks Lying in his Bed Pensive  Bocconi  appeared to him my Lord  Middleton  ask'd him if he  were dead or alive He said dead and that he was a Ghost and told him that within Three Days he should escape and he did so in his Wife's Cloaths when he had done his Message he gave a frisk and said  Givanni Givanni  'tis very strange  In the World to see so sudden a Change  And then gather'd up and vanished This Account Sir  William Dugdale  had from the Bishop of  Edenburgh  And this Account he hath writ in a Book of Miscellanies which is now reposited with other Books of his in the  Musaeum  at  Oxford  Thus the Reader sees what great Authorities may be produced to prove that wonderful and true Predictions have been delivered by many Persons gifted with the  Second Sight  The most learned Men in almost all Nations who are not in all likelyhood deceiv'd themselves The most celebrated and authentick Historians and some Divines in  England  who 'tis not to be thought have combined together and made it their Business to obtrude upon us Falsehoods Persons of all Ranks from the highest to the lowest in  Scotland  who it would be even Madness to think would join in a Confederacy to impose Tricks upon us and to perswade us to the greatest of Impostures as solemn Truths delivered from their own Mouths all these I say have unanimously and as it were with  one Voice  asserted repeated and confirm'd to us  that there have been at all Times and in many different Nations and that still there are Persons who possess'd with the Gift of a  Second Sight  predict Things that wonderfully come to pass and seem to merit very little less than the Name of Prophets for their miraculous Discoveries Now if any Man should come and without giving the least manner of Reason for it for there is no Reason to be given against such Assertions declare his  disbelief  of all these  authentick  though  strange  Accounts can he  with Reason  imagin that his  Incredulity  shall  pass  for a  Token  of  Wisdom  Shall his  Obstinacy  confute the  Learned  Shall his  Want of Faith  be thought  justly  to give the  Lye  to so  many  Persons of the  highest Honour  and  Quality  and of the  most undoubted Integrity  In fine shall his  Infidelity  by a  reverse  kind of  Power  to  that  which is attributed to the  Philosophers Stone  be able to  change  the  Nature  of Things turn and transmute  Truth  into  Falsehood  and make a  down right plain Matter of Fact  to be no more than a  Chimera  or an  Ens Rationis  And shall a  manifest Experience  be  so easily exploded  Taking it therefore for granted that no modest Man whatsoever though never so hard of Belief which is certainly as great a Weakness as that of too much Credulity will make bold openly to declare his disbelief of Things so well attested and taking it much more for granted still that it is impossible for  any Man of common Sense to have the Front of declaring his Disbelief of them in such a manner as to urge it for an Argument and a Reason why others should disbelieve them too taking this I say as I think I very well may for granted I think there remains nothing further for me to offer before I conclude this Chapter except a few Remarks as to the Similitude there is between those Actions which I have related above to have been performed by Mr  Campbell  and these Actions which so many learned ingenious and noble Authors as I have just now quoted have asserted to have been performed by Persons whom they knew to be gifted with the  Second Sight  As to what is said several Pages above concerning  Duncan Campbell  when a Boy at  Edinburgh  that he even told his little Companions who would have Success at their little Matches when they play'd at Marbles and that he inform'd a great Gamester there whose Name I have disguised under that of Count  Cog  what Times he should chuse to play if he would win as ludicrous as it may have appear'd to be and as much as it may have seem'd to my Readers to carry with it nothing better than the Face of Invention and the Air of Fiction yet if they will be at the pains of comparing that Passage of  Duncan Campbell  's with the Account given in this Chapter from the Mouth of Sir  Norman  Maclead  concerning a Man who though he never play'd at Tables in his Life instructed a skilful Gamester when he was at a stand to place one of his  Men  right upon which the whole Game depended which the ignorant Fellow when ask'd how he came to do it said he was directed to by the Spirit  Brownie  whoever I say will be at the pains of comparing these Passages together will find they bear a very near resemblance and that the way we may most reasonably account for  Duncan Campbell  's Prediction when he was a Boy must be that he was at that time directed by his little  Genius  or  familiar Spirit  which I described in the precedent Pages as this Fellow was by the  Spirit Brownie  according to Sir  Norman Maclead  's Assertion which  Spirit Brownie  as Mr  Marten  a very good and credited Writer assures us in his History of the  Western Islands  dedicated to the late Prince  George  of  Denmark  is a  Spirit  usually seen all over that Country  If the Reader recollects He will remem+ber likewise that in the little Discourse which I mentioned to have been held between me and this  Duncan Campbell  when a Boy concerning his little  Genius  I there say the Boy signified to me that he smelt Venison and was sure that some would come to his Mother's House shortly after accordingly I came thither that Morning from the Death of a Deer and order'd a part of it to be brought  after me to her House Now Mr  Marten  's Twelfth Observation about the  Second Sight  in this Chapter clears it plainly up that this Knowledge in the Boy proceeded from the  Gift of Second Sight  Not to give the Reader too often the Trouble of looking back in order to judge of the Truth of what I say I will here repeat that Observation which is as follows Things are also foretold by  Smelling  sometimes For Example  Fish  or  Flesh  is frequently  smelt  in the Fire when at the  same time neither  of the  Two  are in the House or in any  probability  like to be had in it for some  Weeks  or  Months  This  Smell  several Persons have who are endued with the  Second Sight  and its always accomplish'd soon after  But I will here omit any further Remarks by way of accounting how he compass'd his Predictions when a Boy either by the Intervention of his  Genius  or the Gift of a  Second Sight  and examin how nearly those Things which I have related to have been done by him in his more advanc'd Years when he took up the Profession of a  Predictor  in  London  correspond with the Accounts given us in this Chapter about a  Second Sight  and how near a Resemblance the Things done by him bear to those Things that are so well attested to have been perform'd by others thro' the efficacious Power of this wonderful Faculty  First then if we have a mind to make a tolerable guess which way Mr  Campbell  came acquainted that the Death of the beautiful young Lady Mrs  W  lw  d  was so near at Hand and that tho' she was so universally admired she would die unmarried the Accounts given of other  Second sighted  Persons in the like Cases will put us in the most probable way of guessing right This is explain'd by the Seventh Observation in this Chapter where it is said from Mr  Marten  that when a Shroud is perceiv'd about one it's a sure Prognostick of Death the Time is judg'd according to the Height of it about the Person for if it be not seen above the Middle Death is not to be expected for the space of a Year or longer but as it comes nearer to the Head it is expected sooner if to the very Head it is concluded to be at Hand within a few Days if not Hours Of this we have an Example of which Mr  Marten  was an Eyewitness concerning the Death of his own Acquaintance but he did not in the least regard it till the Death of the Person about the Time foretold confirm'd to him the Certainty of the Prediction  Secondly  As to the ignominious Death that  Irwin  came to and which He predicted to his Mother so long before when she was in flourishing Circumstances and when there was no appearance that any of her Children should be brought to a beggarly Condition  and learn among base Gangs of Company to thieve and be carried to the Gallows The Story told in this Chapter of some of the Inhabitants of  Harries  sailing round the  Isle  of  Skye  and seeing the Apparition of Two Men hanging by the Ropes on the Mast of their Vessel and when they came to the opposite MainLand finding Two Criminals just sentenc'd to Death by Sir  Donald Mac Donald  and seeing their own very Mast and Ropes made choice of for their Execution clears up the manner how Mr  Campbell  might predict this of  Irwin  likewise by the force of the  Second Sight  Thirdly  As to Mr  Campbell  's telling  Christallina  the  Belle  and chief  Toast  of the Court and  Urbana  the reigning Beauty of the City that they should shortly be married and who were to be their Husbands it is a Thing he has done almost every Day in his Life to one Woman or other that comes to consult him about the Man she is to be married to the manner he probably takes in doing this may be likewise explain'd by the foregoing Story in this Chapter about the Servants who said they saw Three Men standing by the left Hand of their Master's Daughter and that  he  that was  nearest  would marry her  first  whom they plainly and exactly described tho' they had never seen him but in their Vision as appeared afterwards For within some Months after the very Man described did  come to the House and did  marry  her  Vide  the Eight Observation of the  Second Sight  Fourthly  As to the Predictions deliver'd by Mr  Campbell  to the Merchant which are set down at length in the foregoing Chapter I know no better way at guessing the  manner how  the  Second Sight  operated in him at that Time than by comparing them to these Two Instances which I briefly repeat because they are set down at length before in this Chapter And first it may be ask'd how did the  Second Sight  operate in Mr  Campbell  when it gave him to know that the Merchant's Ships which repeated Intelligences had in appearance confirm'd to be lost were at that time safe and would return securely home into the Harbour designed The best way of accounting for it that I know is by the Story that Sir  Norman MackLead  is above affirm'd to have told with his own Mouth concerning a Servant of his who rightly foretold his returning Home and landing on the  Isle  of  Ber  era  one Night where his Residence is when there was very little or no likelyhood of it because of the Darkness of the Night and the Danger of coming through the Rocks that lie round the Isle When Sir  Norman  examin'd him about it he answer'd that he knew it by a Vision of the Spirit  Brownic  and hence it may be the most probably conjectured that Mr  Campbell  's Knowledge of the Merchant's Ships being safe came from a Vision of his  particular  Genius  or  familiar Spirit  which we spoke of before What I have already instanced in is I think sufficient with regard to the wonderful Things which Mr  Campbell  has perform'd either by the Intervention of a  Genius  or the Power of a  Second Sight  But as he has frequently done a great many amazing Performances which seem to be of such a Nature that they can't be well and clearly explain'd to have been done either by the Intervention of his  familiar Spirit  and  Genius  or by the Power of the  Second sighted Faculty  we must have recourse to the Third Means by which only such Predictions and Practices can be compass'd before we expound these new Mysteries which appear like incredible Riddles and  Aenigma's  at the first and this  Third Means  which we must have recourse to for expounding these strange Acts of his is a due consideration of the Force and Power of Natural Magick which together with a Narrative of the Acts which he seems  magically  to bring about will be the Subject of the following Chapter  CHAP VIII  BUT before we proceed to our Disquisitions concerning the Power and Efficacy of natural Magick and examin what mysterious Operations may be brought about and compass'd by magical Practices and before we take a further Survey of what Mr  Campbell  has perform'd in this kind that relates to his Profession and the publick Part of his Life which concerns other People as well as himself I shall here relate some singular Adventures that he pass'd thoro' in his private Life and which regard only his own Person In order to this I must return back to the Year about which time some unaccountable Turns of Fortune attended him in his own private Capacity which must be very surprizing and entertaining to my Readers when they find a Man whose Foresight was always so great a Help and Assistance to others who consulted him in their own future Affairs helpless as it has been an Observation concerning all such Men in the account of the  Second Sight  and blind in his own future Affairs toss'd up and down by inevitable and spightful Accidents of Fortune and made the Maygame of Chance and Hazard as if that wayward and inconstant Goddess was resolv'd to punish him when  she catch'd him on the blind Side for having such a quick insight and penetrating Faculty in other Peoples Matters and scrutinizing too narrowly into her Mysteries and so sometimes preventing those fatal Intentions of hers into which she would fain lead many Mortals hoodwink'd and before they knew where they were In this Light these mighty and famous  Seers  seem to be born for the Benefit and Felicity of others but at the same time to be born to Unhappiness themselves And certainly in as much as we consider them as useful and beneficial often but always satisfactory to Persons who are curious in their Inquiries about their Fortunes it will be natural to those of us who have the least Share of Generosity in our Minds to yield our Pity and Compassion to them when they are remarkably unfortunate themselves especially when that Calamity seems more particularly to light upon them for their Ability and Endeavour to consult the good Fortune of other Folks  About the abovementioned Year  Duncan Campbel  grew a little tired of his Profession Such a multitude of Followers troubled him several of whom were wild Youths and came to banter him and many more too inquisitive Females to teaze him with endless Impertinences and who the more he told them had still the more to ask and whose Curiosity was never to be satisfied And besides this he was so much envy'd and had so many  malicious Artifices daily practised against him that he resolv'd to leave off his Profession He had I know follow'd it pretty closely from the time I first saw him in  London  which was I think in the beginning of the Year till the Year with very good Success and in those few Years he had got together a pretty round Summ of Mony Our young  Seer  was now at Man's Estate and had learn'd the Notion that he was to be his own Governour so far as to be his own Counsellor too in what Road of Life he was to take and this Consideration no doubt work'd with a  deeper  Impression on  his  Mind than it usually does on  others  that are in the same  blossoming Pride  of Manhood because it might appear more natural for him to believe that he had a sufficient Ability to be his own proper Adviser who had given so many others and some more aged than himself Counsel with very good Success Now every experienc'd Person knows that when Manhood is yet green it is still in the same dangerous Condition as a young Plant which is liable to be warp'd by a Thousand cross fortuitous Accidents if good Measures be not taken to support it against all the contingent Shocks it may meet with from the Weather or otherwise Now it was his Misfortune to be made averse to Business which he lov'd before by having too much of it and to be so soured by meeting with numerous Perplexities and  malicious Rubs laid in his way by invidious People who are the useless and injurious  Busybodies  that always repine at the good of others and rejoice to do harm to the Diligent and Assiduous though they reap no Profit by it themselves that he was disgusted and deterr'd entirely from the Prosecution of a Profession by which he got not only a competent but a copious and plentiful Subsistence Nay indeed this was another Mischief arising to him from his having so much Business that he had got Money enough to leave it off when the Perplexities of it had made him willing to do so and to live very comfortably and handsomely like a Gentleman without it for a time and we know the youngest Men are not wont to look the farthest before them in matters that concern their own Welfare Now inasmuch as he had thus taken a Disgust to Business and Application and was surfeited as I may say with the Perplexities of it it must be as natural for him we know to search for Repose in the contrary extream  viz  Recreation and Idleness as it is for a Man to seek Rest after Toil to sleep after a Day's Labour or to sit down after a long and tiresome Walk But there are two very distinct sorts of Idleness and two very different kinds of Recreation there is a shameful Idleness which is no better than downright Sloth and there is a splendid kind of Indolence where a Man having taken an Aversion  to the Wearisomeness of a Business which properly belongs to him neglects not however to employ his Thoughts when they are vacant from what they ought more chiefly to be about in other Matters not entirely unprofitable in Life the Exercise of which he finds he can follow with more abundant Ease and Satisfaction There are some Sorts of Recreations too that are mean fordid and base others that are very innocent though very diverting and that will give one the very next most valuable Qualifications of a Gentleman after those which are obtained by a more serious Application of the Mind The Idea which I have already given my Readers of our  Duncan Campbell  will easily make them judge before I tell them which way in these two Ways his  Genius  would naturally lead him and that when he grew an idle Man he would rather indulge himself with applying his Mind to the shining Trifles of Life than be wholly slothful and unactive and that when he diverted himself he would not do it after a fordid base manner as having a better taste and a relish for good Company but that his Recreations would still be the Recreations of a Gentleman And just accordingly as my Readers would naturally judge beforehand in his Case so it really happened The Moment he shook of Business and dismiss'd the Thoughts of it his  Genius  led him to a very gallant  Way of Life in his Lodgings in his Entertainments in paying and receiving Visits in Coffeehouses in Taverns in fencing Schools in Balls and other publick Assemblies in all ways in fine both at home and abroad  Duncan Campbell  was a well comported and civil fine Gentleman he was a Man of Pleasure and nothing of the Man of Business appeared about him But a Gentleman's Life without a Gentleman's Estate however shining and pleasant it may be for a time will certainly end in Sorrow if not in Infamy and comparing Life as Moralists do to a Day one may safely pronounce this Truth to all the splendid Idlers I have mention'd that if they have sunshiny Weather till Noon yet the Afternoon of their Life will be very stormy rainy and uncomfortable and perhaps just at the end of their Journey to carry on the  Metaphor  throughout close in the darkest kind of Night Of this as I was a Man of Years and more experienc'd in the World than he I took upon me to forewarn Mr  Campbell  as soon as I perceiv'd the first dangerous Fit of this elegant Idleness had seiz'd him But when will young Men by so much the more headstrong as they have less of the Beard be guided and brought to learn and when shall we see that happy Age in which the grey Heads of old Men shall be clapp'd upon the Shoulders of Youth I told him that in this one thing he ought to consult me  and acknowledge me to be a true Prophet if I told him the end of the seeming merry Steps in Life he was now taking would infallibly bring him to a Labyrinth of Difficulties out of which if he extricated himself at all he would at least find it a laborious piece of Work His Taste had been already vitiated with the Sweets which lay at the top of the bitter Draught of Fortune and my honest rugged Counsel came too late to prevail when his Fancy had decoy'd and debauch'd his Judgement and carry'd it over into another Interest I remember I writ down to him the moral Story where vicious Pleasure and Virtue are pictured by the Philosopher to appear before  Hercules  to court him into two several Paths I told him more particularly since he had not an Estate to go th  with the gentlemanly Life as he call'd it that if he follow'd the alluring Pleasures which endeavour'd to tempt  Hercules  he would involve himself at last in a whole heap of Miseries out of which it would be more than an  Herculean  Labour for him to disentangle himself again If he had been a Man that could have ever heard with either I would have told the Reader in a very familiar Idiom that he turn'd the deaf Ear to me for he did not mind one Syllable nor Tittle of the Prescriptions I set down for him no more than if he had never read them but varying the Phrase a little I may say at least when  he should have look'd upon my Counsel with all the Eyes he had he turn'd the blind Side upon it I was resolv'd to make use of the Revenge natural to a Man of Years and therefore apply'd that reproachful Proverb to him which we Ancients delight much in making use of to Youths that follow their own false and hot Imaginations and will not heed the cooler Dictates of Age Experience and Wisdom Accordingly I wrote down to him these Words and left him in a seeming Passion I am very well assured  young Man  you  think me  that am  Old  to be a  Fool  but  I  that am  Old  absolutely  know you  who are a  young Fellow  to  be a downright Fool  and so I leave you to follow your own ways till sad and woful Experience teaches you to know it your ownself and makes you come to me to own it of your own accord As I was going away after this tart Admonition and severe Reprimand I had a Mind to observe his Countenance and I saw him smile which I rightly construed to be done in contempt of the advice of Age and in the Gaiety and Fulness of Conceit which Youth entertains of its own fond Opinions and hairbrain'd rash Resolves He was got into the Company of a very pretty set of Gentlemen whose Fortunes were far superior to his but he follow'd the same genteel Exercises as Fencing  c  and made one at all their publick Entertainments and so being at an equal Expence  with those who could well afford to spend what they did out of their Estates he went on very pleasantly for a time still spending and never getting without ever considering that it must by inevitable consequence fall to his Lot at last to be entirely reduced to a State of Indigence and Want And what commonly heightens the Misfortune of such Men and so of all Gentlemens younger Brothers who live upon the ready Money that is given them for their Portions is that the Prosperity they live in for a time gains them Credit enough just to bring them in Debt and render them more Miserable than those very Wratches who never had either any Money or Credit at all They run themselves into Debt out of Shame and to put off the evil Day of appearing ruin'd Men as long as they can and then when their Tempers are souer'd by Adversity they grow tir'd of their own Lives and then in a Quarrel they or some other Gentleman may be is run thorough or else being hunted by Bayliffs they Exercise their Swords upon those Pursuers Thus where Gentlemen will not consider their Circumstances their very Prosperity is a Cause of and aggravates their Misery their very  Pride  which was a decent Pride at first in keeping up and maintaining their  Credit  subjects them too often to the lowest and the meanest Acts and their Courage which was of a laudable Kind turns into a brutish and  savage Rage and all the fine esteem'd flourishing and happy Gentleman ends and is lost in the contemn'd poor and miserable Desperado whose Portion at last is Confinement and a Goal and sometimes even worse and what I shall not so much as name here Into many of these Calamities Mr  Campbell  had brought himself before it was long by his heedlesness and running according to the wild Dictates of Youth counter to all sound and wholesome Advice He had it seems run himself into Debt and one Day as he was at a Coffeehouse the Sign of the Three  Crowns  in great  Queenstreet  in rush'd Four Bayliffs upon him who being directed by the Creditor's Wife had watch'd him into that House and told him they had a Warrant against him and upon his not answering they being unacquainted with his being deaf and dumb offer'd to seize his Sword He startled at their offering of Violence and taking them for Russians which he had often met with repell'd the Assaulters and drawing his Sword as one Man more bold than the rest closed in with him he shorten'd his Blade and in the Fall pinn'd the Fellow through the Shoulder and himself through the Leg to the Floor After that he stood at Bay with all th  Four Officers when the most mischievous Assailant of them all the Creditor's Wife  to step into the Fray and very barborously took hold of that nameless Part of  the Man for which as she was a married Woman Nature methinks should have taught her to have a greater Tenderness and almost squeez'd and crush'd those Vitals to death But at last he got free from them all and was going away as fast as he could not knowing what Consequences might ensue But the Woman who aim'd herself at committing Murder in the most savage and inhuman Manner ran out after him crying out Murder Murder as loud as she could and alarmed the whole Street The Bayliff's following the Woman and being bloody from Head to Foot by means of the Wound he receiv'd gave Credit to the Outcry The late Earl  Rivers  's Footmen happening to be at the Door ran immediately to stop the suppos'd Murderer and they indeed did take him at last but perceiv'd their Mistake and discovered that instead of being Assistants in taking a Man whom they thought to be a Murderer endeavouring to make his Escape from the Hands of Justice they had only been trick'd in by that false Cry to be Adjutants to a Bayliff in retaking a Gentleman who by so gallant a Defence had rescu'd himself from the Dangers of a Prison and when they had discover'd this their Mistake they were mighty sorry for what they had done The most active and busy among the Earl's Footmen was a  Dutch  Man and the Earl happening to be in a Room next the Street and hearing the  Outcry of Murder step'd to the Window and seeing his own Servants in the midst of the Bustle examin'd the  Dutch  Man how the Matter was and being told it he chid the Man for being concern'd in stopping a Gentleman that was getting free from such troublesome Companions But the  Dutch  Man excused himself like a  Dutch  Man by making a very merry Blunder for a Reply  Sacramente  said he to his Lord if I had thought they were Bayliffs I would have fought for the poor dumb  Gentleman  but then why had not  he told  me they were Bailiffs my Lord  In short  Duncan Campbell  was carry'd off as their Prisoner but the Bayliff that was wounded was led back to the Coffee House where he pretended the Wound was Mortal and that he despair'd of living an Hour The Proverb however was of the Fellow's Side and he recover'd sooner than other People expected he could Assoon as all Danger was over an Action for Damages and smart Money as their Term is was brought against Mr  Campbell  the Damages were exaggerated and the Demand was so extravagant that  Duncan Campbell  was neither able just at that Time nor willing had he been able to pay so much as he thought in his own Wrong and having no Bail and being asham'd to make his case known to his better sort of Friends who were both able and willing to help him at a dead List he was hurry'd away  to Goal by the Bayliffs who shew'd such a malignant and insolent Pleasure as commonly attends powerful Revenge when they put him into the Marshalsea There he lay in Confinement Six Weeks till at last Four or Five of his chief Friends came by mere Chance to hear of it immediately they consulted about his Deliverance and unanimously resolved to contribute for his Enlargement and they accordingly went cross the Water together and procured it out of Hand  Two of his Benefactors were Officers and were just then going over to  Flanders Duncan Campbell  to whom they communicated their Design was resolved to try his Fortune in a Military Way out of a roving kind of Humour raised in him partly by his having taken a sort of Aversion to his own Profession in Town and partly by his finding that he could not live without following a Profession as he had done any longer He over a Bottle frankly imparted his Mind to them at large he signify'd to them that he hoped since they had lately done him so great a Favour in freeing him from one Captivity they would not think him too urgent if he press'd for one Favour further upon Natures so generous as theirs by whom he took as great a Pleasure in being obliged as he could receive in being capable of obliging others He wrote to them that the Favour he meant was to redeem him from another Captivity almost  as irksome to him as that out of which they had lately ransom'd him This Captivity continued he is being either forc'd to follow my old Profession which I have taken an entire Disgust to for a Maintenance or being forc'd to live in a narrower Way than suits with my  Genius  and the better Taste I have of higher Life Such a State Gentlemen you know is more unpalatable than Halfpay it is like either being forc'd to go upon the  forlorn Hope  or else like a Man's being an entirely cashier'd and broken Officer that had no younger Brother's Fortune and no other Support but his Commission Thus though you have set my Body at Liberty my Soul is still under an Imprisonment and will be till I leave  England  and can find means of visiting  Flanders  which I can do no otherwise than by the advantage of having you for my Convoy I have a mighty longing to Experience some part of a Military Life and I fancy if you will grant me your Interest and introduce me to the valiant young Lord  Lorne  and be Spokesmen for a dumb Man I shall meet with a favourable Reception and as for you Gentlemen after having named that great Patron and Pattern of Courage and Conduct in the Field I can't doubt but the very Name I bear if you had not known me would have made you taken me for a Person of a Military  Genius  and that I should do nothing but what would become a  British  Souldier and a Gentleman nothing in fine that should make you repent the Recommendation  These generous and gallant Friends of his it seems comply'd with his Request and promis'd they would make Application for him to the Lord  Lorne  and  Duncan Campbell  had nothing to do but to get his Bag and Baggage ready and provide himself with a Pass His Baggage was not very long a getting together and he had it in tolerable good Order and as for his Pass a Brother of the Lord  Forbes  was so kind as to procure him one upon the first Application  Duncan  made to him  Accordingly in a few Days afterwards they went on Board and having a speedy and an easy Passage arrived soon at  Rotterdam Duncan  met with some of his  English  Acquaintance in that Town and his Mind being pretty much bent upon rambling and seeing all the Curiosities Customs and Humours he could in all the foreign Places he was to pass thorough he went out of a Frolick with some Gentlemen next Day in a Boat to an adjacent Village to make merry over a homely  Dutch  Entertainment the intended Repast being to consist of what the Boors there count a great Delicacy brown Bread and white Beer He walk'd out of sight from his Company and they lost one another and stroling about by himself at an unseasonable Hour as  they call it there after the Bell has toll'd  Duncan Campbell  who neither knew their Laws nor if he had was capable of being guided by the notice which their Laws ordain was taken into Custody in the Village for that Night and carry'd away the next Day to  Williamstadt  where he was taken for a Spy and put into a close Imprisonment for Three or Four Days  But some  Scotch  Gentlemen who had been in Company with Mr  Campbell  at Mr  Cloysterman  's a Painter in  Coventgarden  made their Application to the Magistrate and got him releass'd He knew his Friends the Officers that carried him over were gone forward to the Camp and that there was no Hope of finding them at  Rotterdam  if he should go thither and so he resolv'd since he had had so many Days Punishment in  Williamstadt  to have Three or Four Days Pleasure there too by way of Amends before he would set out on his Journey after his Friends But on the Third Night he got very much in Drink and as he went very boisterously and disorderly along a Sentry challeng'd him and the want of the Sense of Hearing had like to have occasion'd the Loss of his Life The Sentry fir'd at him and narrowly miss'd him He was taken Prisoner not without some Resistance which was so far Innocent as that he knew not any reason why he should be feized but very troublesome and unwarrantable  in so orderly a Town so the Governor's Secretary after the matter was examined into judging it better for the unhappy Gentleman's future Safety advis'd him to return home to his own Country and accordingly bespoke him a Place in a  Dutch  Ship called  Yowfrow Catherine  for his Passage to  England  Duncan Campbell  had taken up this Humour of rambling first of his own accord and the Troubles which he had run himself into by it we may reasonably suppose had pretty well cur'd him of that extravagant Itch and there is little doubt to be made but that he rejoyc'd very heartily when he was got on Board the Ship to return to  England  and that in his new Resolutions he had reconciled himself to the Prosecution of his former Profession and intended to set up for a  Predictor  again assoon as he could arrive at  London  But now Fortune had not a Mind to let him go off so he had had his own Fancy for rambling and now she was resolv'd to have hers and to give him his bellyful of Caprice Accordingly when the  Dutch  Ship called  Yowfrow Catherine  was making the best of her Road for  London  and each Person in the Vessel was making merry fill'd with the Hopes of a quick and prosperous Passage a  French  Privateer appeared in sight crouding all the Sails she could and bearing towards them with all haste and diligence The Privateer was doublemann'd and carry'd Thirty  Guns The  Dutch  Vessel was defenceless in comparison and the People on Board had scarce time to think and to deplore that they should be made a Prey of before they actually were  so  and had Reason enough given them for their Sorrow All the Passengers to a single Man were stripp'd and had  French  Seamens Jackets in exchange for their Cloaths  Duncan Campbell  had now a Taste given him of the Fate of War as well as of the Humour of travelling and wish'd himself again I warrant him among his greatest Croud of Consulters as tiresome as he thought Business to be instead of being in the Middle of a Crew of  SeaSavages  The Town where the Dumbprisoner was at last confin'd was  Denain  There happened to be some  English  Fryers there who were told by the others who he was and to them he apply'd himself in writing and receiv'd from them a great deal of civil Treatment But a certain Man of the Order of  Recollects  happening to see him there who had known him in  England  and what Profession he followed caused him to be called to Question as a Man that made use of ill means to tell Fortunes When he was question'd by a whole Society of these religious Men he made them such pertinent and satisfactory Answers in writing that he convinced them he had done nothing for which he deserv'd their Reprimand and they unanimously acquitted him The Heads of  his Defence as I have been informed were these  First  He alledg'd that the  Second Sight  was inborn and inbred in some Men and that every Country had had Examples of it more or less but that the Country of  Scotland  in which he was educated from an Infant abounded the most of any with those sort of People And from thence he said he thought he might very naturally draw this Conclusion that a Faculty that was inborn and inbred to Men and grown almost a national Faculty among a People who were remarkably Honest Upright and wellmeaning People could not without some Impiety be imputed to the Possessors of it as a Sin and when one of the Fathers rejoin'd that it was remark'd by several Writers of the  Second Sight  that it must be therefore  Sinful  because it remain'd no longer among the People when the Doctrines of Christianity were fully propagated and the Light of the Gospel increased among them and that afterwards it affected none but Persons of vicious Lives and an ill Character To this Objection Mr  Campbell  reply'd that he knew most even ingenious Writers had made that Remark concerning the  Second Sight  but beg'd leave to be excused if he ventured to declare that it was no better than a vulgar and common Error and the Reasons were these which he alledg'd in his own behalf and to confirm his  Assertion he told them Men of undoubted Probity Virtue and Learning both of  their own Religion    viz  the  Roman  Catholick and also of  the Reform'd Religion  and in several Nations had been affected and continued all their Lives to be affected with this  Second sighted  Power and that there could be therefore no room to fix upon it the odious Character of being a sinful and vicious not to say that some call'd it still worse a diabolical Talent He said he would content himself with making but two Instances because he believ'd those Two would be enough to give Content to them his Judges too in that Case In his first Instance he told them that they might find somewhat relating to this in  Nicolaus Hemingius  who in his Tracts  de Superstitionibus Magicis  printed at  Copenhagen Anno  informs the World that  Petrus Palladius  a Bishop of  Seelandt  and Professor of Divinity at  Copenhagen  could from a part of his Body affected foretel from what part of the Heavens Tempests would come and was seldom deceiv'd One of the Father's immediately ask'd him if he understood  Latin  To this  Duncan Campbell  reply'd no Oh Said the Fryer then I don't remember that Book was ever translated into  English  that you mentionBut rejoin'd  Duncan Campbell  the Passage I mention'd to you I have read in an  English  Book and Word for Word according to the best of my Memory  as I have written it down to youIn what  English  Book said the FryerI don't remember the Name of the Book  Duncan Campbell  answer'd but very well remember the Passages and that it was in a Book of Authority and which bore a Credit and good Repute in the World and you being Scholars may if you please have recourse to the learned Original and I doubt not but you'll find what I say to be a TruthFor the Second Instance he told them that in  Spain  there are those they call  Saludadores  that have this kind of Gift There was continued he in Writing one of your own Religion venerable Fathers and of a religious Order nay a Fryer too that had this Gift He was a noted  Dominican  said he and though I forget his Name you may by writing a Letter to  England  learn his Name He was a devout  Portuguese  belonging to Queen  Catherine Dowager's  Chappel and had the  Second Sight  to a great degree and was famous and eminent for it They then ask'd him what was the full Power he had to do by the  Second Sight  He answer'd that as they had intimated that they had perused some of the skilful Writers concerning the  Second Sight  he did not doubt but they had found as well as he could tell them that as to the Extent of Peoples Knowledge in that secret way it reach'd both present past and future Events They foresee Murders Drownings Weddings Burials  Combats Manslaughters  c  of all which there are many Instances to be given They commonly foresee sad Events a little while before they happen for Instance if a Man's fatal End be Hanging they'll see a Gibbet or Rope about his Neck if Beheading they'll see a Man without a Head if Drowning they'll see Water up to his Throat if Stabbing they'll see a Dagger in his Breast if unexpected Death in his Bed they'll see a winding Sheet about his Head They foretel not only Marriages but of good Children what kind of Life Men shall lead and in what Condition they shall die also Riches Honours Preferments Peace Plenty and good Weather It's likewise usual with Persons that have lost any Thing to go to some of these Men by whom they are directed how with what Persons and in what Place they shall find their Goods It is also to be noted that these Gifts bear a Latitude so that some have it in a far more eminent Degree than others and what I have here written down to you you need not take as a Truth from me but as it concern'd me so nearly I remember the Passage by heart and you will find it very near Word for Word in Dr  Beaumont  's Book of  familiar Spirits  Ay said the Fryers but you have a  Genius  too that attends you as we are inform'd So reply'd  Duncan Campbell  have all Persons that have the  Second Sight  in any eminent Degree and to prove this I will  bring no less a Witness than King  James  who in his  Demonology  Book the Third and Chapter the Second mentions also a Spirit call'd  Brownie  that was wont formerly to haunt divers Houses without doing any Evil but doing as it were necessary turns up and down the House he appear'd like a rough Man nay some believ'd that their House was all the  Sonsier  as they call'd it that is the more lucky or fortunate that such Spirits resorted there With these replies the Fryers began to own they were very well satisfy'd and acquiese'd in the Account he had given of himself as a very good true and honest Account But they told him they had still a further Accusation against him and that was that he practis'd Magick Arts and that he us'd as they had been inform'd unlawful Incantations To this he made Answer that there were two Kinds of Magick of which he knew they that were Men of learning could not be ignorant The Art Magick which is Wicked and Impious continued he is that which is profess'd and has been profess'd at all Times in the World by  Witches Magicians Diviners Inchanters  and such like notorious Profligates who by having an unnatural Commerce with the Devil do many strange prodigious and preternatural Acts above and beyond all humane Wisdom and all the Arguments I ever did or ever will deduce continued he from that black Art is a  good and a shining Argument It is this O Fathers I draw a Reason from these prodigious Practices of  Wizards Magicians Inchanters c  and from all the Heathen Idolatry and Superstition to prove that there is a  Deity  for from these Acts of theirs being preternatural and above humane Wisdom we may consequently infer that they proceed from a supernatural and immaterial Cause such as  Demons  are And this is all the Knowledge I ever did or ever will draw from that black hellish Art But Fathers there is another Kind of Art Magick call'd natural Magick which is directly opposite to theirs and the Object of which Art is to do spiritual Good to Mankind as the Object of theirs is to torment them and induce them to Evil They afflict People with Torments and my Art relieves them from the Torments they cause The publick Profession of these  Magical Arts  has as you know Fathers 'tis a common Distinction between  black  and  white  Magick been tolerated in some of the most famous Universities of  Christendom  though afterwards for a very good Reason in  Politicks  making it a publick Study to such a Degree was very wisely retrench'd by a Prohibition If this therefore be a Fault in your own Opinions hear my  Accusers  but if not you will not only  excuse  but  commend  me  The Fryers were extreamly well pleased with his Defence But one of them had a  Mind to frighten him a little if he could and ask'd him what he would say if he could produce some Witches lately seiz'd that would swear he had been frequently at their unlawful Assemblies where they were making their waxen Images and other odd mischievous Inventions in black Magick to torment Folks what if I can produce such Evidence against you wrote the Father to him by way of strengthening the Question will you not own that we have convicted you then And when he had wrote the Note he gave it  Duncan Campbell  with a Look that seem'd to express his Warmth and Earnestness in the Expostulation  Duncan Campbell  took the Paper and read it and far from being startled return'd this Answer with a Smile continuing in his Face while he wrote it No said he Fathers by your leave they will only prove me a good Magician by that Oath and themselves more plainly Witches They will prove their Love to torment good Folks and only shew their Hatred to me an innocent Man but wise enough to torment 'em by hindering 'em from tormenting others The Fathers were well pleas'd with the Shrewdness of the Answer But  Duncan Campbell  had a mind to exert his Genius a little farther with the good Fryer who thought likewise he had put him a very shrew'd Question so taking up another Sheet of Paper Fathers said he shall I entertain you with a Story of what pass'd  upon this Head between two religious Fathers as you all of you are and a Prince of  Germany  in which you will find that mine ought to be reputed a full Answer to the Question the last learned Father was pleased to propose to me The Story is somewhat long but very much to the purpose and entertaining I remember it perfectly by heart and if you will have Patience while I am writing it I don't doubt but that I shall not only satisfy you but please you and oblige you with the Relation The Author I found it in quotes it from  Fromannus  I think the Man's Name was so and I am sure my Author calls him a very learned Man in his Third Book of  Magical Incantation  and tho' I don't understand the Language the Original is writ in yet I date venture to say upon the Credit of my  English  Author from whom I got the Story by heart that you will find me right when ever you shall be pleased to search  The Fryers were earnest for the Story and express'd a desire that he would write it down for them to read which he did in the following Words  N  te that I have since compared Mr  Duncan Campbell  's Manuscript with the Author's Page out of which he took it and find it Word for Word the same which shews how incomparable a Memory this deaf and dumb Gentleman has got besides his  other extraordinary Qualifications  The Story is this  "A  Prince  of  Germany  invited  two religious Fathers  of  eminent Virtue  and  Learning  to a Dinner The  Prince  at Table said to one of them Father Think you we do right in hanging Persons who are accused by Ten or Twelve  Witches  to have appear'd at their Meetings or Sabbaths  I  somewhat  fear  we are  imposed on  by the  Devil  and that it is not a  sofe  Way to  Truth  that  we walk  in by  these Accusations  especially since many  great  and  learned  Men  every where  begin to  cry  out  against  it and to charge our Consciences with it Tell  me  therefore  your Opinion  To whom the Fathers being somewhat of an eager Spirit said What should make us doubtful in this Case Or what should touch our Consciences being convicted by so many Testimonies Can we make it a Scruple whether God will permit innocent Persons should be so traduc'd There is no Cause for a Judge to stick at such a Number of Accusations but he may proceed with Safety To which when the  Prince  had reply'd and much had been said  Pro  and  Con  on both Sides about it and the  Father  seem'd wholly to carry the Point the  Prince  at length concluded the Dispute saying I am sorry for you  Father  that in a  Capital Cause  you have  condemn'd  yourself  and  you  cannot  complain  if  I commit  you to  Custody  For  no less  than  Fifteen Witches  have  deposed  that  they  have  seen you  ay start not  You your own self  at  their Meetings  And to  show you  that  I  am  not  in  Jest  I will presently cause the  publick Acts  to be brought for  you  to  read  them The  Father  stood in a  Maze  and with a  dejected Countenance  had  nothing  here to  oppose  but  Confusion  and  Silence  for  all his learned Eloquence  "  As soon as Mr  Campbell  had wrote down the Story the Fathers perused it and seemed mightily entertain'd with it It put an end to all further Questions and the Man whom they had been trying for a Conjurer they joined in desiring upon distinct Pieces of Paper under their several Hands to come frequently and visit them as being not only a harmless and innocent but an extraordinary wellmeaning good and diverting Companion They treated him for sometime afterwards during his Stay with the Friendship due to a Countryman with the Civility that is owing to a Gentleman and with the Assisiance and Support which beloag'd to a Person of Merit in Distress Money they had none themselves it seems to give him being  Menditants  by their own Prosession but they had Interest enough to get him quite free from being Prisoner he participated of their  Elemosinary Table  had a  Cell  allow'd him  among them in what they call their  Dormitory  he had an odd Coat and a pair of Trowzers made out of some of their brown coarse Habits by the poor unfashionable Taylor or  Botcher  belonging to the Convent and at last they found means of recommending him to a Master of a  French  Vessel that was ready to set Sail to give him a cast over the Channel to  England  and to provide him with the Necessaries of Life till he got to the Port This  French  Vessel was luckier than the  Dutch one  had been before to our dumb Gentleman it had a quick and prosperous Passage and arriv'd at  Portsmouth  and as soon as he landed there he having experienc'd the Misfortunes and Casualties that a Man in his Condition wanting both Speech and hearing was liable to in Places where he was an utter Stranger to every Body resolv'd to make no Stay but move on as fast as he could towards  London  When he came to  Hampton Town  considering the indifferent Figure he made in those odd kind of Cloaths which the poor Fryers had equipp'd him with and that his long Beard and an uncomb'd Wigg added much to the Disguise he was resolved to put on the best Face he could in those aukward Circumstances and stepp'd into the first Barber's Shop he came at to be trimm'd and get his Wigg comb'd and powder'd This proved a very lucky Thought to him for as soon as he stepp'd into the first Barber's Shop who  should prove to be the Master of it but one  Tobit Yeats  who had served him in the same Capacity at  London  and was but newly set up in the Trade of a BarberSurgeon at  Hampton Town  and followed likewise the Profession of Schoolmaster This  Tobit Yeates  had shaved him quite before he knew him in that Disguise and Mr  Campbell  though he knew him presently had a mind to try if he should be known himself first At length the Barber finding him to be a dumb Man by his ordering every thing with Motions of the Hand and Gestures of the Body look'd at him very earnestly remember'd him and in a great Surprize called for Pen Ink and Paper and begg'd to know how he came to be in that Disguise whether he was under any Misfortune and Apprehension of being discover'd that made him go in so poor and so clownish a Habit and tender'd him any Services as far as his little Capacity would reach and desir'd him to be free and command him if he was able to assist him in any thing These were the most comfortable Words that  Duncan Campbell  had read a great while He took the Pen and Paper in his turn related to him his whole Story gave the poor Barber thanks for his good natured Offer and said he would make so much use of it as to be indebted to him for so much Money as would pay the Stage Coach and bear him in his travelling Expences up to  London  from  whence he would speedily return the Favour with Interest The poor honest Fellow out of Gratitude to a Master whose Liberality he had formerly experienc'd immediately furnish'd Mr  Duncan Campbell  with that little Supply expressing the Gladness of his Heart that it lay in his Power and the Stage Coach being to set out within but a few Hours he ran instantly to the Inn to see if he could get him a Place By good luck there was Room and but just Room for one more which pleas'd  Duncan Campbell  mightily when he was acquainted with it by his true and trusty Servant the Barber for he was as impatient to see  London  again it seems as he had been before to quit it Well he had his Wish and when he came to  London  he had one Wish more for Fortune to bestow upon him which appear'd to begin to grow kind again after her fickle Fit of Cruelty was over and this Wish was that he might find his former Lodgings empty and live in the same House as he did when he follow'd his Prosession This too succeeded according to his Desire and he was happily fix'd once more to his Heart's Content in his old Residence with the same People of the House round about him who bore him all that Respect and Affection and shew'd all that Readiness and Willingness to serve him on every Occasion and at every turn which could be expected from Persons that let Lodgings in Town to  a Gentleman whom they esteem'd the best Tenant they ever had in their Lives or ever could have  Immediately the Tidings of the dumb Gentleman's being return'd home from beyond Sea spread throughout all the Neighbourhood and it was nois'd about from one Nighbourhood to another till it went through all Ranks and Conditions and was known as well in a Day or Two's Time all the Town over as if he had been some great Man belonging to the State and his Arrival had been notified to the Publick in the  Gazette  as a Person of the last Importance And such a Person he appear'd indeed to be taken for especially among the fair Sex who throng'd to his Doors Croud after Croud to consult with him about their future Occurrences in Life  These curious Tribes of People were as various in their Persons Sex Age Quality Profession Art Trade as they were in the Curiosity of their Minds and the Questions they had intended to propound to this  dumb Predictor  of strange Events that lay yet as Embrio's in the Womb of Time and were not to come some of them to a Maturity for Birth for very many Years after just as porcelain Clay is stored up in the Earth by good Artificers which their Heirs make  China  of half a Century and sometimes more than an Age afterwards  These Shoals of Customers who were to fee him well for his Advice as we may suppose now he stood in need of raising a fresh Stock were unquestionably as welcome and acceptable to him as they appeared too troublesome to him before when he was in a State of more Wealth and Plenty  Fortune that does nothing moderately seem'd now resolv'd as she had been extreamly cruel before to be extreamly kind to him He had nothing to do from early in the Morning till late at Night but to read Questions and resolve them as fast as much frequented Doctors write their Prescriptions and Recipe's and like them also to receive Fees as fast Fortune was indeed mightily indulgent to the Wants she had so suddenly reduc'd him to and reliev'd him as suddenly by these  Knots  of  Curioso's  who brought him a Glut of Money But one single fair Lady that was one of his very first Consulters after his Return and who had receiv'd satisfactory Answers from him in other Points before he went abroad prov'd so good Fortune would have it worth all the rest of his Customers together as numerous as they were and as I have accordingly represented them  This Lady was the Relict or Widow of a Gentleman of a good Estate and of a very good Family whose Name was  Digby  and a handsome Jointure she had out of the Estate This Lady it seems having been with  him in former Days and seen him in a more shining Way of Life for he had taken a Humour to appear before all his Company in that coarse odd Dress made out of the Fryer's Habit and would not be perswaded by the People of the House to put on a Nightgown till he could provide himself with a new Suit was so curious among other Questions as to ask him whether he had met with any Misfortunes and how he came to be in so slovenly and wretched a Habit Here Mr  Campbell  related the whole Story of his Travels to her and the Crosses and Disappointments he had met with abroad The Tears he observ'd would start every now and then into her Eyes when she came to any doleful Passage and she appear'd to have a mighty compassionate kind of feeling when she read of any Hardship more than ordinarily melancholy that had befallen him Mr  Campbell  it is certain had then a very good Presence and was a handsome and portly young Man and as a great many young Gentlemen derive the seeming Agreeableness of their Persons from the Taylor and Perruquemaker the Shoemaker and Hosier so Mr  Campbell  's Person on the other Hand gave a good Air and a good Look to the aukward Garb he had on and I believe it was from seeing him in this odd Trim as they call it the Ladies first took up the humour of calling him  the handsome Sloven  Add to this that  he look'd his Misfortune in the Face with a jolly Countenance and smiled even while he was penning the Relation of his Calamities All which are certainly Circumstances that first sooth a generous Mind into a State of Compassion and afterwards heighten it in the Breast wherein it is conceiv'd Hence it came that this pretty and good natur'd Widow Mrs  Digby  when she had express'd her Commiseration of him by her Looks began to take the Pen and express it in very tender Terms Neither did she think that Expression in Words a sufficient Testimony of the Compassion she bore to him the Generosity of her Mind did lead her to express it in a more substantial manner still and that was to shew it plainly by a very benevolous Action She laid a Purse of Twenty Guineas before the Table and at the same time smiling pointed to the Table as signifying her desire that he would accept it and running to the Door drop'd a Curtesy and skuttled away and by the same civil Act as she oblig'd him she put it out of his Power to refuse being so obliged so that though the Present was very handsome the manner of giving it was still handsomer If being a handsome young Man of Merit in Distress and bearing his Misfortunes with an equal Mind are powerful Motives to excite Compassion in the Mind of a generous Lady so the Generosity of a young agreeable Widow express'd in so kind and so  benevolous a Way to a young Gentleman when he had been tasting nothing but the bitter Draughts of Fortune before must stir up an Affection in a Mind that had any sense of Gratitude And truly just such was the Effect that this Lady's Civility had upon Mr  Duncan Campbell  He conceiv'd from that Moment a very great Affection for her and resolv'd to try whether he could gain her which he had no small Grounds to hope from the Esteem which she appear'd to bear towards him already I remember Mr  Dryden  makes a very beautiful Observation of the near Alliance there is between the Two Passions of Pity and Love in a Woman's Breast in one of his Plays His Words are these  For Pity still foreruns approaching Love As Light'ning does the Thunder  Mr  Bruyere  a most ingenious Member of the  French  Academy has made another Remark which comes home to our present purpose He says  That many Women love their Money better than their Friends but yet value their Lovers more than their Money  According to the Two Reflections of these fine Writers upon the Tempers of the Fair Mr  Campbell  had hopes enough to ground his Courtship upon and it appeared so in the End by his proving Successful She from being a very liberal and friendly Client became at last a most Affectionate Wife He then began to be a Housekeeper and accordingly took a little neat one  and very commodious for his Profession in  Monmouth  Court Here I must take leave to make this Observation That if Mr  Campbell  inherited the Talents of his secondsighted Mother he seem'd likewise to be an Heir to his Father Mr  Archibald Campbell  both in his strange and accidental Sufferings by Sea and likewise in his being reliev'd from them after as accidental and strange a manner by an unexpected Marriage just like his Father's And here we return again to take a new Survey of him in the course of his publick Practice as a Predictor The Accounts I shall give of his Actions here will be very various in their Nature from any I have yet presented to the Reader they are more mysterious in themselves and yet I shall endeavour to make the manner of his operating in this kind as plain as I think I have the foregoing ones and then I flatter my self they must afford a fresh Entertainment for every Reader that has any curiosity and a good taste for things of so extraordinary a Kind For what I have all along propounded to myself from the beginning and in the progress to the end of this History is to interweave entertaining and surprising Narratives of what Mr  Campbell  has done with curious and instructive Enquiries into the nature of those Actions for which he has rendred himself so singularly famous It was not therefore suitable to my purpose to clog  the Reader with numerous Adventures almost all of the same Kind but out of a vast number of them to single some few of those that were most remarkable and that were Mysteries but Mysteries of very different sorts I leave that Method of swelling distorted and commented Trifles into Volumes to the writers of Fable and Romance if I was to tell his Adventures with regard for Example to Women that came to consult him I might perhaps have not only written the Stories of eleven thousand Virgins that died Maids but have had Relations to give of as many marry'd Women and Widows and the Work would have been endless All that I shall do therefore is to pick out one particular each of a different Kind that there may be variety in the Entertainment Upon Application to this Dumb Man one is told in the middle of her Health that she shall die at such a time another that she shall sicken and upon the moment of her recovery have a Suiter and a Husband a Third who is a celebrated Beauty with a multitude of Admirers round about her that she shall never become a Wife a Fourth that is marry'd when she shall get rid of an uneasy Husband a Fifth that hath lost her Goods who stole them where and when they shall be restored a Sixth that is a Merchant when he shall be Undone and how and when he shall recover his Losses and be as great on  the  Exchange  as ever a seventh that is a Gamester which will be his winning and which his losing Hour an eighth how he shall be involv'd in a Lawsuit and whether the Suit will have an adverse or a prosperous Issue a ninth that is a Woman with choice of Lovers which she shall be most happy with for Life and so on to many others where every Prediction is perfectly new and surprizing and differs from the other in almost every Circumstance When a Man has so extensive a Genius as this at foretelling the future Occurrences of Life one Narrative of a sort is enough in Conscience to present the Reader with and several of each kind would not methinks be entertaining but tiresome for he that can do one thing in these kinds by the power of Prediction can do ten thousand and those who are obstinate in extenuating his Talents and calling his Capacity in question and that will not be convinc'd by one Instance of his Judgment would not own the conviction if ten thousand Instances were given them The best Passages I can recommend to their Perusal are those where Persons who came purposely to banter him under the colour of consulting him and cover'd over their sly Intentions with borrow'd Disguises and came in Masquerades found all the Jest turn'd upon themselves in the End which they meant to our famous  Predictor and had the discouragement of seeing their most conceal'd and deepest laid Plots discovered and all their most witty Fetches and wily Contrivances defeated till they were compelled universally to acknowledge that endeavouring to impose upon the Judgment of our  Seer  by any hidden Artifice and Cunning whatsoever was effectually imposing upon their own His unusual Talent in this kind was so openly known and so generally confess'd that his Knowledge was celebrated in some of the most witty Weekly Papers that ever appear'd in Publick  Isaac Bickerstaff  who diverted all the  Beaumond  for a long space of time with his Lucubrations takes occasion in several of his Papers to applaud the Speculations of this dumb Gentleman in an admirable vein of Pleasantry and Humour peculiar to the Writer and to the Subject he writ upon And when that bright Author who join'd the uttermost Facetiousness with the most solid Improvements of Morality and Learning in his Works laid aside the Title of a  Tatler  and assumed the Name of a  Spectator  and Censor of Men's Actions he still every now and then thought our  Duncan Campbell  a Subject worthy enough to employ his farther Considerations upon I must take notice of one Letter sent concerning him to the  Spectator  in the Year which was at a time when a Lady wanted  him after he had remov'd from  Monmouth Street  to  Drury Lane  Mr SPECTATOR  ABout two Years ago I was called upon by the younger part of a Country Family by my Mother's side related to me to visit Mr  Campbell  the dumb Man for they told me that was chiefly what brought them to Town having heard Wonders of him in  Essex  I who always wanted Faith in such Matters was not easily prevailed on to go but lest they should take it ill I went with them when to my own surprize Mr  Campbell  related all their past Life in short had he not been prevented such a Discovery would have come out as would have ruin'd their next Design of coming to Town  viz  buying Wedding Cloaths Our Namestho' he never heard of us before and we endeavoured to conceal were as familiar to him as to ourselves To be sure Mr  Spectator  he is a very  learned  and  wise  Man Being impatient to know my Fortune having paid my Respects in a  Family Jacobus  he told me after his manner among several other things that in a Year and nine Months I should fall ill of a new Fever be given over by my Physicians but should with much difficulty recover  That the first time I took the Air afterwards I should be address'd to by a young Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune good Sense and a generous Spirit Mr  Spectator  he is the purest Man in the World for all he said is come to pass and I am the happiest  She  in  Kent  I have been in Quest of Mr  Campbell  these three Months and cannot find him out Now hearing you are a dumb Man too I thought you might correspond and be able to tell me something for I think my self highly obliged to make his Fortune as he has mine 'Tis very possible your Worship who has Spies all over this Town can inform me how to send to him If you can I beseech you be as speedy as possible and you will highly oblige your constant Reader and Admirer  Dulcibella Thankley  The  SPECTATOR  'S Answer  ORDERED That the Inspector I employ about Wonders enquire at the  GoldenLion  opposite to the  HalfMoon  Tavern in  Drurylane  into the Merit of this silent Sage and report accordingly  Vide  the th Volume of  Spectators  No being on  Wednesday September  the d  But now let us come to those Passages of his Life the most surprizing of all during the time that he enjoy'd this Reputation and when he prov'd that he deserved the Fame he enjoy'd Let us take a Survey of him while he is wonderfully curing Persons labouring under the misfortune of Witchcraft of which the following Story will be an emiment Instance and likewise clear up how he came by his Reputation in  Essex  as mentioned in the abovementioned Letter to the  Spectator  In the Year  Susanna Johnson  Daughter to one Captain  Johnson  who liv'd at a place adjacent to  Rumford  in  Essex  going one Morning to that Town to buy Butter at the Market was met there by an old miserablelooking Woman just as she had taken some of her Change of the Marketwoman  in Copper and this old Woman rather demanded than begg'd the Gentlewoman to give her a Penny Mrs  Johnson  reputing her to be one of those hateful People that are call'd sturdy Beggars refused it her as thinking it to be no act of Charity and that it would be rather gratifying and indulging her Impudence than supplying or satisfying her Indigence Upon the refusal the old Hag with a Face more wrinkl'd still if possible by Anger than it was by Age took upon her to storm at young Mrs  Johnson  very loudly and to threaten and menace her But when she found her common Threats and Menaces were of no avail she swore she would be reveng'd of the young Creature in so signal a manner that she should repent the Denial of that Penny from her Heart before she got home and that it should cost her many Pounds to get rid of the Consequences of that Denial and her Anger The poor innocent Girl despised these last words likewise and getting up on Horseback return'd Homewards But just as she got about half way her Horse stop'd and no means that she could use would make him advance one single step but she staid a while to see if that would humour him to go on At last the Beast began to grow unruly and snorted and trembled as if he had seen or smelt something that frighted him and so fell a kicking desperately till he threw  the Girl from the Saddle not being able to cling to it any longer tho' a pretty good Horsewoman of her Years so much were the Horse's Motions and Plungings more than ordinarily violent  As Providence would have it she got not much harm by the Fall receiving only a little Bruise in the right Shoulder but she was dreadfully frighted This Fear added Wings to her Feet and brought her home as speedily of herself as she usually came on Horseback She immediately without any other sign of Illness than the pallid Colour with which Fear had disorder'd the Complexion of her Face alarm'd all the Family at home with the Story took her Bed upon it complain'd of inward Rackings of the Belly and was never at case unless she lay doubled up together her Head to her Knees and her Heels to her Rump just like a Figure of She could not be a single Moment out of that Posture without shrieking out with the violence of anxious Torments and racking Pains  In this condition of Misery amidst this agony of Suffering and in this double Posture was the poor wretched young Gentlewoman brought to Town Physicians were consulted about her but in vain she was carry'd to different Hospitals for assistance but their Endeavours likewise prov'd ineffectual At last she was conducted to the College  of Physicians and even the collective Wisdom of the greatest Sages and Adepts in the Science of Physick was pos'd to give her any Prescription that would do her service and relieve her from the inexplicable Malady she labour'd under The poor incurable Creature was one constant Subject of her complaining Mother's Discourse in every Company she came into It hapned at last and very providentially truly that the Mother was thus condoling the Misfortune of her Child among five or six Ladies and telling them among other things that by the most skilful Persons she was look'd upon to be bewitch'd and that 'twas not within the power of Physick to compass her Recovery They all having been acquainted with our Mr  Duncan Campbell  unanimously advised her to carry her Daughter to his House and consult with him about her The Mother was overjoy'd at these tidings and purposed to let no time slip where her Child's Health was so deeply concerned She got the Ladies to go with her and her Child to be Eyewitnesses of so extraordinary a piece of Practice and so eminent a trial of Skill  As soon as this dismal Object was brought into his Room Mr  Duncan Campbell  lifted up her Head and look'd earnestly in her Face and in less than a Minute's time signify'd to the Company that she was not only bewitch'd but in as dreadful a Condition almost  as the Man that had a Legion of Fiends within him  At the reading of these words the unhappy Creature rais'd up her Head turn'd her Eyes upwards and a Smile a thing she had been a stranger to for many Months overspread her whole Face and such a kind of Colour as is the flushing of Joy and Gladness and with an innocent tone of Voice she said she  now had a firm belief she should shortly be deliver'd  The Mother and the rest of the Company were all in Tears but Mr  Campbell  wrote to them that they should be of good Heart be easy and quiet for a few Moments and they should be convinc'd that it was Witchcraft but happily convinc'd by seeing her so suddenly well again This brought the Company into pretty good Temper and a little after Mr  Campbell  desir'd she might be led up Stairs into his Chamber and left there alone with him for a little while this occasioned some small Female Speculation and as much Mirth as their late Sorrow alleviated with the hopes of her Cure would permit  This you may be sure was but a snatch of Mirth just as the nature of the thing would allow of and all sorts of Waggery being laid instantly aside and remov'd almost as soon as conceiv'd the poor young thing was carry'd in that double Posture up Stairs She had not been much above half an Hour there  when by the help only of Mr  Campbell  's Arm she was led down Stairs and descended into that Room full of Company as a Miracle appearing in a Machine from above she was led backward and forward in the Room while all gaz'd at her for a while with joyful Astonishment for no Arrow was ever more strait than she Mr  Campbell  then prevail'd with her to drink a glass of Wine and immediately after she evacuated Wind which she had not done for some Months before and found herself still more amended and easy And then the Mother making Mr  Campbell  some small Acknowledgment at that time with the promise of more and her Daughter giving Thanks and all the Company commending his Skill took their Leaves and departed with great demonstrations of Joy I shall here to cut the Story short signify that she came frequently afterwards to make her Testimonials of Gratitude to him and continues to enjoy her Health to this very Day at  Greenwich  where she now lives and will at any time if call'd upon make Oath of the Truth of this little History as she told me herself with her own Mouth  The next thing therefore it behoves me to do in this Chapter is to give some satisfactory account of Magick by which such seeming mysterious Cures and Operations are brought about  This Task I would perform in the most perspicuous and most convincing manner I can for Magick I know is held to be a very hard and difficult Study by those Learned and universally unlawful and diabolical by those Unlearned who believe there is such a Science attainable by Human Genius On the other hand by some Learned Men who believe there is no such Science it is represented as an inconsistent System of Superstitions and Chimera's and again laugh'd at as such by the Unlearned who are of an incredulous Temper What I would therefore undertake to do in this place is to shew the Learned Men who believe there is such an Art that the attainment to a tolerable Knowledge of the manner how magical Practices may be brought about is no such difficult Matter as they have represented it to themselves and by doing this I shall make the System of it  so plain  that while the Learned approve of it the Unlearned too who are not of an unbelieving Kind may understand clearly what I say and the Learned Men who have rejected this Science as  chimerical  may be clearly convinced it is  real  and then there is nothing left but obstinate unbelieving Ignorance which I shall not here pretend by Arguments to lead into Sense but leave it to the work of Time In fine I will endeavour to induce Men of Sense to say that what has been accounted mysterious  is deliver'd in a plain easy and convincing manner and to own that they approve while Men of the lower Class of Understanding shall confess and acknowledge that they themselves understand it and that what has hitherto been represented as arduous and difficult to a great Genius is adapted and render'd not only clear but familiar to Persons of midling Talents In this Work therefore I shall follow the strictest Order I can which of all things render a Discourse upon any Subject the most clear and that it may be plain to the commonest Capacity I will first set down what Order I intend to follow  First  I will speak of Magick in general  Secondly  Of Magick under its several Divisions and Subdivisions  Thirdly  Concerning the Object of Art as it is Good or Bad  Fourthly  Of the Persons exercising that Art in either Capacity of Good or Bad and by what means they become capacitated to exercise it  In the  Fifth  place I shall come to the several Objections against the Art of Magick and the Refutation of those Objections  The first Objection shall be against the Existence of good and bad Spirits The Refutation of which will consist in my proving the Existences of Spirits both Good and Bad by Reason and by Experience  The second Objection that will be brought is to contain an Allegation that there are no such Persons as Witches now and an Argument to support that Allegation drawn from the Incapacity and Impossibility of any thing's making while itself is incarnate a Contract with a Spirit This Objection will be answer'd by proving the reality of Witches from almost Universal Experience and by explaining rationally the manner how the Devils hold Commerce with Witches which Explication is back'd and authoriz'd by the Opinion of the most Eminent Divines and the most Learned Physicians  From hence  Sixthly  and lastly We shall conclude on the side of the good Magick that as there are Witches on the one hand that may afflict and torment Persons with Daemons so on the other hand there are lawful and good Magicians that may cast out Daemons from People that are possess'd with them  And  First  as to  Magick  in general  Magick  consists in the Spirit by Faith for Faith is that MAGNET of the Magicians by which they draw Spirits to them and by which Spirits they do great things that appear like Miracles  Secondly Magick  is divided into three sorts viz  Divine Natural  and  Diabolical  And Natural  Magick  is again subdivided into two kinds Simple and Compound And Natural Compound  Magick  is again likewise  divided into two Kinds  viz  Naturaldivine  Magick  and Naturaldiabolical  Magick  Now to give the Reader a clear and a distinct Notion of each several Species of  Magick  here mentioned I set down the following DefinitionsDivine  Magick  is a Celestial Science in which all Operations that are wonderfully brought about are performed by the Spirit of GodNatural  Magick  is a Science in which all the mysterious Acts that are wrought are compass'd by Natural SpiritsBut as this Natural  Magick  may be exercised about things either in a manner indifferent in themselves or mere morally Good and then it is mere natural  Magick  or else about things Theologically good and transcendently bad and then it is not merely and Natural  Magick  but Mix'd and Compound If Natural  Magick  be exercised about the most holy Operations it is then mix'd with the Divine and may then be called not improperly Naturaldivine Magick But if Natural  Magick  troubles itself about compassing the wickedest Practices then is it promiscuous with the  Demoniacal  and may not improperly be called Natural diabolical  Magick  Thirdly  The Object of this Art is doing Wonders out of the ordinary appearing course of Nature which tend either to great good or bad by the help and Mediation of Spirits good and bad  Fourthly  As to the Persons exercising that Art in either way whether good or bad and by what Means they become capacitated to act it the Notion of this may be easily deduced from the Notions of the Art itself as considered above in its each different Species for as all Magick consists in a Spirit every Magician acts by a Spirit  Divine Magicians that are of God are spoke of in the sacred Book and therefore I shall not mention the Passages here but pass them over as ought in a Book like this with a profound and reverential Silence as well as the other Passages which speak of Natural and Daemoniacal Magicians and in all I shall speak of them in this Place I shall only speak of them with Regard to humane Reason and Experience and conclude this Head with saying that  Natural Magicians work all Things by the Natural Spirits of the Elements  but that  Witches and Daemoniacal Magicians  as  Jannes  and  Jambers  in  Aegypt  were  work their magical Performances by the Spirit of Daemons  and 'tis by the Means of these  different Spirits  that these  different Magicians  perform their  different  Operations  These Things thus distinctly settled and explained 'tis now we must come and ground the Dispute between those who believe there are no such Things as  Magicians  of any Kind  and those who assert there are of all the Kinds above specify'd  Those who contend there are have recourse to Experience and relate many wellwitness'd Narratives to prove that there have been in all Times and that there are still Magicians of all these Kinds But those who contend that there are no such Persons will give no ear to what the others call plain Experience they call the Stories let whatever Witnesses appear to justify them either fabulous Legends invented by the Authors or else Tricks of intellectual  Logerdemain  imposed by the Actors upon the Relators of those Actions Since therefore they say tho' the Believers in Magick bragg of Experience never so much it may be but a fallible Experience they reasonably desire to know whether these Gentlemen that stand for Magick can answer the Objections which they propose to prove that the Practice of Magick according to the System laid down is inconsistent with Reason before they will yield their Assent Let the Stories be never so numerous appear neverso credible these unbelieving Gentlemen desire to be try'd by Reason and aver till that Reason is given they will not be convinc'd by the  Number  of Stories because tho' numerous they are Stories still neither will they believe them because they appear credible because seeming so is  not being so and Appearances tho' never so fair when they contradict Reason are not to be swallowed down with an implicit Faith as so many Realities And thus far no doubt the Gentlemen who are on the unbelieving Side are very much in the right on't The learned Gentlemen on the other hand who are persuaded of this mighty mysterious Power being lodged in the Hands of Magicians answer that they will take upon them to refute the most subtle Objections brought by the learned Unbelievers and to reconcile the Practicability of magical Mysteries by the Capacity of Men who study that Art to  right Rules  and  Laws  of Reasoning and to shew that some Stories tho' never so prodigious which are told of Magicians demand the Belief of wise Men on two Accounts because as Experience backs Reason on the one hand Reason backs Experience on the other and so the Issue of the whole Argument whether there are Magicians or not is thrown upon both Experience and Reason These Arguments on each side I shall draw up fairly  pro  and  con  for I don't pretend to be the Inventor of them my self they belong to other Authors many Years ago be it enough for me to boast of if I can draw them up in a better and closer Form together than they have yet appeared in In that I take upon my self a very great Task I erect my self as it were into a kind of a  Judge  I will sum up the  Evidences on both sides and I shall whereever I see Occasion intimate which side of the Argument bears the most Weight with me but when I have enforced my Opinion as far as I think needful my Readers like a Jury are still at Liberty to bring in their Verdict just as they themselves shall see fit and this naturally leads me where I promised to come to in the fifth Part of this Discourse to the several Objections against the Power of Art Magick and the Refutation of those Objections  The first Objections being against the Existence of Spirits and the Refutations thereof  THE first Objection which they who reject Magick make use of is denying that there are any such Things as Spirits about which since those who defend the Art say it intirely exerciseth itself the Objectors contend that if they can make out that there are no such Beings as Spirits all Pretensions to the Art must be intirely groundless and for the future exploded  To make this Part out that there are no Spirits the first Man they produce on their Side is undoubtedly one of very great Credit and Authority inasmuch as he has justly born for many Centuries the Title of a  Prince of Philosophers They say that  Aristotle  in his Book  de Mundo  reasons thus against the Existence of Spirits  viz  That since God can do all Things of himself he doth not stand in Need of ministring Angels and Daemons A Multitude of Servants shewing the Weakness of a Prince  The Gentlemen who defend the Science make this Reply they allow the Credit and Authority of  Aristotle  as much as the Objectors But as the Objectors themselves deny all the Authorities for the Spirits and desire that Reason may be the only Ground they go upon so the Refuters on their Parts desire that  Aristotle  's  ipse dixit  may not be absolutely pass'd upon them for Argument but that his Words may be brought to the same Touchstone of Reason and proved if they are Standard If this Argument say they will hold good  Aristotle  should not suppose Intelligencies moving the Caelestial Spheres for God sufficeth to move all without ministring Spirits nor would there be Need of a Sun in the World for God can enlighten all Things by himself and so all second Causes were to be taken away therefore there are Angels and ministring Spirits in the World for the Majesty of God not for his Want of them and for Order not for his Omnipotency And here if the Objectors return and say who told you that there are Spirits Is not yours a precarious  Hypothesis Mayn't we have leave to recriminate in this Place Pray who told  Aristotle  that there were Intelligencies that moved the Caelestial Spheres Is not this Hypothesis as precarious as any Man may pretend that of Spirits to be And we believe there are few Philosophers at present who agree with  Aristotle  in that Opinion and we dare pronounce this to be ours that  Aristotle  took his Intelligencies from the  Hebrews  who went according to the same whimsical tho' pretty Notion which first gave Rise to the Fiction of the Nine Muses But more than all this it is a very great Doubt among learned Men whether this Book  de Mundo  be  Aristotle  's or no  The next Thing the Objectors bring against the Existence of Spirits is that it is Nonsense for Men to say that there are such Beings of which it is impossible for a Man to have any Notion and they insist upon it that it is impossible for any Man to form an Idea of a spiritual Substance As to this part the Defendants rejoin that they think our late most judicious Mr  Lock  in his claborate and finish'd Essay on humane Understanding has fairly made out that Men have as clear a Notion of  a spiritual Substance  as they have of  any corporeal Substance Matter  or  Body  and that there is as much Reason for admitting the Existence of the  one  as of the  other  for that if they admit the  latter  it is but Humour in them to deny the  former  It  is in Book the  d Chap  where he reasons thus  "If a Man will examine himself concerning his Notion of pure Substance in general he will find he has no other Idea of it but only a Supposition of he knows not what Support of such Quality which are capable of producing simple Ideas in us which Qualities are commonly called Accidents Thus if we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal Substance as  Horse Stone  c tho' the Idea we have of either of them be but the Complication or Collection of those several simple Ideas or sensible Qualities which we use to find united in the Thing call'd  Horse  or  Stone  yet because we cannot conceive how they should subsist alone not one in another we suppose them to exist in and be supported by some common Subject which Support we denote by the Name of Substance tho' it be certain we have no clear or distinct Idea of that Thing we suppose a Support The same happens concerning the Operations of our Mind  viz  Thinking Reasoning and Fearing  c  which we concluding not to subsist of themselves and not apprehending how they can belong to  Body  we are apt to think these the Actions of  some Substance  which we call  Spirit  Whereby it's evident that having no other Notion of Matter but something wherein those many sensible Qualities which affect our Senses do subsist by supposing a Substance  wherein Thinking Knowing Doubting and a Power of Moving  c  do subsist we have as  clear  a Notion of the Nature or Substance of  Spirit  as we have of  Body  the one being snpposed to be without knowing what is the  Substratum  to those simple Ideas which we have from without and the other supposed with a like Ignorance of what it is to be the  Substratum  of these Operations which we experiment in ourselves within 'Tis plain then that the Idea of corporeal Substance in Matter is as remote from our Conceptions and Apprehensions as that of spiritual Substance and therefore from our not having any Notion of the Substance of Spirit we can no more conclude its not Existence than we can for the same Reason deny the Existence of Body it being as rational to affirm there is  no Body  because we cannot know its Essence as it's called or have the Idea of the Substance of Matter as to say there is no Spirit because we know not its Essence or have no Idea of a spiritual Substance"  Mr  Lock  also comparing our Idea of Spirit with our Idea of Body thinks there may seem rather less Obscurity in the former than the latter Our Idea of Body he takes to be an extended solid Substance capable of communicating Motion by Impulse and our Idea of Soul is a Substance that thinks and has a Power of exciting Motion in Body by Will or Thought Now some perhaps will say  they comprehend a thinking Thing which perhaps is true but he says if they consider it well they can no more comprehend an extended Thing and if they say they know not what it is thinks in them they mean they know not what the Substance is of that thinking Thing no more says he do they know what the Substance is of that solid Thing and if they say they know not how they think he says neither do they know how they are extended how the solid Parts are united or where to make Extension  c  The learned Monsieur  le Clerc  who generally knows how far humane Reason can bear argues consonantly to what is before deliver'd by Mr  Lock  in his  Coronis  added to the end of the fourth Volume of his Philosophical Works in the third Edition of them where he writes as followeth  When we contemplate the corporeal Nature we can see nothing in it but Extension Divisibility Solidity Mobility and various Determinations of Quantity or Figures which being so it were a rash Thing and contrary to the Laws of right Reasoning to affirm other Things of Bodies and consequently from mere Body nothing can be deduced by us which is not joined in a necessary Connexion with the said Properties Therefore those who have thought the Properties of perceiving by Sense of Understanding Willing  Imagining Remembring and others the like which have no Affinity with corporeal Things to have risen from the Body have greatly transgressed in the Method of right Reasoning and Philosophising which hath been done by  Epicurus  and those who have thought as he did having affirmed our Minds to be composed of corporeal Atoms But  whence  shall we say they have had their Rise truly they do not owe their Rise to  Matter  which is wholly destitute of Sense and Thought nor are they spontaneously sprung up from nothing it being an  ontological Maxim  of most evident Truth that  nothing springs from nothing  Having thus given the Reader the first Objections made against the Existence of Spirits and the  Refutations  thereof I must now frankly own on which side my Opinion leans and for my Part it seems manifest to me that there are two Beings we conceive very plainly and distinctly  viz Body  and  Spirit  and that it would be as  absurd  and  ridiculous  to deny the Existence of the  one  as of the  other  And really if the Refuters have got the better in their Way of Reasoning they have still a much greater Advantage over the Objectors when they come to back these Reasons with fresh Arguments drawn from Experience Of this there having been many undoubted Narratives given in the foregoing  Pages concerning the Apparitions of Spirits I shall refer the Reader back again to them and only subjoin here one or two Instances which may if required be prov'd upon Oath of Spirits seen by two Persons of our  Duncan Campbell  's own Acquaintance In the Year one Mrs  Stephens  and her Daughter were together with Mr  Campbell  at the House of Mr  Ramell  's a very great and noted Weaver at  Haggerstone  where the rainy Weather detained them till late at Night Just after the Clock struck Twelve they all of them went to the Door to see if the Rain had ceased being extremely desirous to get home As soon as ever they had open'd the Door and were all got together their appear'd before them a Thing all in White the Face seem'd of a dismal pallid Hue but the Eyes thereof fiery and flaming like Beacons and of a saweer Size It made its Approaches to them till it came up within the Space of about three Yards of them there it fixt and stood like a Figure agaze for some Minutes and they all stood likewise stiff like the Figure frozen with Fear Motionless and Speechless When all of a sudden it vanish'd from their Eyes and that Apparition to the Sight was succeeded by a Noise or the Appearance of a Noise like that which is occasioned by the Fighting of twenty mastiff Dogs  Not long after Mrs  Anne Stephens  who lived in  Spittlefields  a Woman well known by her great Dealings with Mercers upon  LudgateHill  sitting in her House alone and musing upon Business happened by Accident to look behind her and saw a dead Corps to her thinking lie extended upon the Floor just as a dead Corps should be excepting that the Foot of one Leg was fix'd on the Ground as it is in a Bed when one lies with one Knee up she look'd at it a long while and by degrees at last stole her Eyes from so unpleasing and unexpected an Object However a strange kind of a Curiosity overcame her Fears and she ventured a second Time to turn her Head that Way and saw it as before fix'd for a considerable time longer but durst not stir from her Seat she again withdrew her Eyes from the horrible and melancholy Spectacle and resum'd the Courage after a little Reflection of viewing it again and resolving to ascertain herself if the Vision was real by getting up from her Seat and going to it but upon this third Retrospection she found it vanish'd This Relation she writ down to Mr  Duncan Campbell  and has told before Mrs  Ramell  her own Sister and many other very creditable Persons Now as to these Arguments from Experience I shall also deliver my Opinion I dispute not but that learned Men who have obstinate Prepossessions may produce  plausible Arguments why all Things should be thought to be done by Imposture which seem strange to them and interfere with their Belief and truly thus far their Humour may be indulged that if only one Person relates a very strange and surprising Story a Man may be more apt to think it is  possible  for that Person to  lie  than that so  strange  a Relation should be  true  but if a considerable Number of Persons of several Countries several Religions several Professions several Ages and those Persons look'd upon to be of as great Sagacity as any the Country afford agree in Relations of the same Kind tho' very strange and are ready to vouch the Truth of them upon Oath after having well consider'd Circumstances I think it a Violation of the Law of Nature to reject all these Relations as fabulous merely upon a selfpresuming Conceit unless a Man can fairly shew the Things to be impossible or can demonstrate wherein those Persons were imposed on for from hence I form the following conclusive Argument What is possible according to Reason grows probable according to Belief where the Possibility is attested to have reduc'd itself into Action by Persons of known Credit and Integrity Now not only the Possibility of the Existence of Spirits but the actual Existence thereof is proved above by logical Demonstration therefore are we to believe both by the Course of logical  Reason and moral Faith that those Existencies have appeared to Men of Credit who have attested the Reality thereof upon Oath  Second Objection against the Existence of Witches  THESE Objectors go on to say that provided they should allow there is an Existence of Spirits yet that would be still no Argument how  Magick  should subsist because they deny that it is impossible for a Man in his Body to have a Commerce much less make a Contract with Spirits but here again the  Refuters  alledge they have both Experience and Reason on their Sides As a joint Argument of Reason and Experience they tell you that the numerous Witches which have in all Countries been arraigned and condemned upon this Occasion are evident Testimonies of this Commerce and Contract being held and made with Spirits They pretend to say that these Objectors call not their the Refuters Judgment so much in Question who contend that there is a magick Art as they call in Question the Judgment of all the wisest legislative Powers in Christendom  who have universally agreed in enacting penal Laws against such capital Offenders  But here the Objectors return and say that it being impossible for us to shew  the manner how  such a Contract should be made we can never but without Reason believe a Thing to be of which we can form no perfect Idea The Refuters on the other hand reply with the learned Father  le Brune  it's manifest that we can see but two sorts of Beings  Spirits  and  Bodies  and that since we can reason but according to our own Ideas we  ought  to  ascribe  to  Spirits  what  cannot  be produced by  Bodies  Indeed the Author of the Republick of Learning in the Month of  August Anno  has given us a rough Draft for writing a good Tract of Witchcraft which he looks upon as a  Desideratum  Where among other Things he writes thus Since this Age is the true Time of Systems one should be contriv'd concerning the Commerce that may be betwixt Daemons and Men  On this Passage Father  le Brune  writes thus  "Doubtless here the Author complies with the Language of a great many Persons who for want of Attention and Light would have us put all Religion in Systems Whatever Regard I ought to have for many of those Persons I must not be afraid to say that there is no System to be made of those Truths which we ought to learn distinctly by Faith because we must advance nothing  here but what we receive from the Oracle We must make a System to explain the Effects of the Loadstone the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea the Motion of the Planets for that the Cause of these Effects is not evidently signified to us and many may be conceived by us and to determine us we have need of a great number of Observations which by an exact Induction may lead us to a Cause that may satisfie all the  Phoenomena  It's not the same in the Truths of Religion we come not at them by groping it were to be wish'd Men spoke not of them but after a decisive and infallible Authority It's thus we should speak of the Power of  Daemons  and of the Commerce they have with Men it's of Faith that they have Power and that they attack Men and try to seduce them divers Ways It is true indeed they are sometimes permitted to have it over the Just tho' they have it not ordinarily but over those that want Faith or Fear not to partake of their Works and that to the last particularly the  disorder'd Intelligencies  try to make exactly succeed what they wish inspiring them to have Recourse to certain Practises by which those seducing Spirits enter into Commerce with Men"  Thus far Father  le Brune  But still these Objectors demand to know by  what Means  this Commerce may be held between Daemons and Men and urge us to describe the  Manner  or pretend that they have  still reason to refuse coming into the Belief of a Thing which we would impose upon them tho' wholly ignorant of it ourselves To that the Refuters answer thus That both Christian Divines and Physicians agree as to the manner how which they are so curious in enquiring after that  Daemons  stir up Raptures and Extasies in Men binding or loosing the exterior Senses and that either by stopping the Pores of the Brain so that the Spirits cannot pass forth as it's done naturally by Sleep or by recalling the sensitive Spirits from the outward Senses to the inward Organs which he there retains So the Devil renders Women Witches extatical and Magicians who while they lie fast asleep in one Place think they have been in divers Places and done many Things This the learned Objectors say proceeds from no Daemon but from the Disease call'd an Epilepsy but on the other hand the more learned Refuters insist upon it that these Extasies are not epileptick Scizures This say they appears from  Bodin  in his  Theatre of universal Nature  where he says  "That those that are wrapt by the Devil feel neither Stripes nor Cuttings nor no Wresting of their Limbs nor burning Tortures nor the Application of a red hot Iron nay nor is the Beat of the Pulse nor the Motion of the Heart perceived in them but afterwards returning to themselves they feel most bitter Pains  of the Wounds received and tell of Things done at Miles distance and affirm themselves to have seen them done"  The ingenious Dr  Ader  makes an admirable physical Distinction between this kind of Extasie and a Syncope or Stupor caused by narcotick Medicines  Sennertus  in his  Institutio Medica  writes of the Daemoniacal Sopor of Witches who think they are carry'd thro' the Air dance feast and have Copulation with the Devil and do other Things in their Sleep and afterwards believe the same Things waking Now he says  "Whether they are really so carry'd in the Air  c  or being in a profound Sleep or only Dream they are so carry'd and persist in that Opinion after they are awake These Facts or Dreams cannot be natural for it cannot be that there should be so great an Agreement in Dreams of Persons differing in Place Temperament Age Sex and Studies that in one Night and at the same Hour they should in concert dream of one and the same such Meeting and should agree as to the Place Number and Quality of the Persons and the like Circumstances but such Dreams are suggested from a preternatural Cause  viz  from the Devil to his Confederate by the Divine Permission of an Almighty Power where Punishments are to be permitted to be inflicted upon reprobate Sinners"  Whence also to those Witches sincerely converted and refusing to be any more present at those diabolical Meetings those Dreams no longer happen which is a Proof that they proceeded not before from a natural Cause  Here begins the great Point of the Dispute as to that Branch of Magick which we call Natural Magick The Objectors may tell us that they will freely own that there may be an Existence of Spirits that there may be an Existence of Witches that by a divine Power Men may be influenced so far as to have a Communication with good Spirits and that from thence they may become spiritual divine Magicians They will likewise perhaps as freely grant that by the Intervention of a Daemon Things preternatural may be brought about by Persons who have studied the Daemoniacal Magick but then what they principally insist upon is that it must be contradictory to all humane Reason to imagine that there can be such a Thing as Natural Magicians and thus far they may form their Argument They say that the Persons who contend for the magick Art own that all that is brought about by Magick is by the Assistance and Help of a Spirit and that consequently what is Effected by it must be preternatural Now they say it is a Thing inconsistent by a Natural Power to bring about a preternatural Effect therefore there  can be no such Thing as Natural Magick which has within itself the Efficacy of destroying those Acts done by Magicians in the Diabolical  To this the Refuters take leave to reply that the Foundation upon which the Argument is built is wrong grounded they have admitted that in diabolical Art Magick there may be a Commerce held between Men and Spirits by which several preternatural Effects may be brought about and the Reason they assign for it there is because there is a preternatural Agent concerned therein the Devil But then say they in Natural Magick you can pretend to no such Agent and therefore to no such preternatural Effect This Argument contains within it two Falacies First as to the Commerce held between a Man and a Daemon there is nothing preternatural in getting the Acquaintance the Will of the Man is entirely Natural either naturally good or naturally corrupted The black Spirit that converseth with him it is acknowledg'd is not so but it is from the Will of the Man not from the Power vested in the Devil that the Acquaintance first grows therefore the Acquaintance it self is natural tho' it arises from the last Corruption and Depravations of Nature but being made with a preternatural Existence tho' the Cause of the Acquaintance be corruptedly Natural yet the intermediate Cause or Means after that  Acquaintance is not so and therefore the Effect of that intermediate Cause may be wonderful and seem to be out of the ordinary Course of Nature Now since it is generally allow'd that there are Natural Spirits of the Elements as well as Divine and Infernal what we have to prove is only this that Man by Natural Magick may have a Commerce with Natural Spirits of their Elements as Witches may have with the Spirits or Daemons Now as we said before the Commerce itself depends upon the Will of the Person and is therefore Natural and consequently may as well subsist between the one as the other for the Devil cannot force a Man to hold a Commerce with him whether he will or no The second Falacy is calling the Effect preternatural no otherwise than as it connotates the Agent that brought it about which is a spiritual Agent for the Effect is in itself consider'd Natural and brought about by second Causes that are Natural by the Devil's Penetration who is subtile enough to make use of them for such and such Ends Now Men by Natural Spirits which are of a Faculty thoroughly subtle may as well with natural second Causes compass the Remedy of an evil Spirit as the Devil is able to infect Men with it From these Speculations a farther plain Consequence may be deduced how a Man may by the pure Force of Natural Magick cure a Person that  is infested with Evils by a Daemon for how is it that a Daemon infests any Body with his evil Motions It's true he is a preternatural Agent but the evil Effect he does is brought about by Natural Causes For how does a Daemon stir up Raptures or Extasies in Men why he does it as we are told above by binding or loosing the exterior Senses by stopping the Pores of the Brain so that the Spirits cannot pass forth And this the Art of Physick can compass by its Drugs and Sleep causes the same Thing very naturally of itself therefore as the Evil itself is Natural the Remedy that is Natural will certainly overcome it But then say you why can't those Persons be cured by Physicians I answer not because their Remedies are not in themselves sufficient to cure the Evils themselves but because generally Physicians don't administer their Drugs as Christians but as Physicians and when they prescribe them to the Sick they generally prescribe to them only purely consider'd as Patients not as Christians and therein they come to fail Because the Agent the Devil is a subtle Spirit that brings the Evil and alters its Situation before the Remedy which would master it otherwise can take any Effect which Agent the Devil is employ'd by the horrible and impious Faith of the Antiphysician  viz  the black Magician But if the Physician would act the Christian at the same time so far as to have a  Faith that Things ordain'd in the Course of Nature for the Good of Man would have its Effects in spite of a Devil if taken with a good Faith by the Patient That all good Things ordain'd to be for the natural Recovery of Men if they took it with Thankfulness to the Sender would have due Effect why then the Natural Spirits of the Elements would resist the farther Agency of the Daemoniacal Spirit and then nothing but the Natural Evil caused at first by the Daemon remaining in the Person without the farther Superintendency of the Daemon might demonstratively be taken away by the mere natural Remedy or Medicine And thus good and pious Physicians making use of such proper Remedies as their Skill teaches them and having an honest Faith that the Goods of Nature intended for the Use and Benefit of Man if received by the Patient with the same good Faith is above the Power of the Devil to frustrate may not improperly be called Natural Magicians These Arguments of mine I shall now take Leave to back by Experience  Besides what we have urged from Reason concerning the Power of Natural Magick we shall only subjoin that Divines themselves hold that Natural Magick and also Natural Divinations and Prophecies are proved by Quotations from that venerable Writ which is their Guide and bring Proofs from the same also that by Natural Magick  Daemons are also cast forth but not all kinds of Daemons and so many Works of Efficacy are wrought by Natural Magick They tell you such was the  Pythonissa  that raised the Apparition to  Saul  which appeared in a Body of Wind and Air Thus if a Person by Natural Magick should cast out Daemons it does not follow that this was also from Divine Magick and if Daemons are cast out by Natural Magick by one that is in the Fear of God it does not follow that he is a true Magician of God but if it exorbitates to Daemoniacal then it is condemned and when Natural Magick keeps within its Bounds the Divines tell us it is not condemn'd in the venerable Book which is the Christian's sure Guide But inasmuch as the Lawfulness even of Natural Magick has been called in Question by others I shall in an  Appendix  join'd to this Treatise examine that Matter both according to the Reasons of our  English  Laws and according to the best stated Rules of Casuistry that I am a Master of still submitting my Judgment to the superior Judgment of those who are profess'd Divines and Lawyers And if my Opinions prove erroneous I am willing to retract them and therefore in this place there remains nothing farther for me to do but only as I have shewn on the one hand how Natural Magick and its powerful Operations are prov'd by Reason to shew on the other hand how  far Reason in these Cases is likewise back'd and supported by wellevidenc'd Practice and notorious Experience And to do this after having mentioned one memorable Instance which I refer the Reader to in the Body of the Book concerning the Performances of Mr  Greatrix  to which a Lord  Orrery  was a Witness in  Ireland  I shall to avoid Prolixity bring the other Testimonials of Practice from the Success which our  Duncan Campbell  himself has had in this Way on other Occasions  In the Year lived in  Fanchurchstreet  one Mr  Coates  a TobaccoMerchant who had been for many Years sorely tormented in his Body and had had Recourse for a Cure to all the most eminent Physicians of the Age even up to the great Dr  Ratcliff  himself but all this mighty Application for Relief was still in vain Each Doctor own'd him a Wonder and a Mystery to Physick and left him as much a Wonder as they found him Neither could the Professors of Surgery guess at his Ailment or resolve the Riddle of his Distemper and after having spent from first to last above a thousand Pounds in search of proper Remedies they found the Search ineffectual The learned all agreed that it could proceed from nothing else but Witchcraft they had now indeed guess'd the Source of his Illness but it was an Illness of such a Kind that when they had  found it out they thought themselves not the proper Persons to prescribe to him any Remedies That Task was reserv'd it seems for our  Duncan Campbell  who upon some Body's Information or other was sent for to the betwiched Patient Mr  Coates  who found him the Wonder that the others had left him but did Wonders in undertaking and compassing his Cure I remember one of the Ingredients made use of was boiling his own Water but I can't tell how 'twas used and upon turning over the Books of some great Physicians since I have found that they themselves have formerly deliver'd that as one part of the Prescriptions for the Cure of Patients in like Cases But as there are other Things which Mr  Campbell  performs that seem to require a Mixture of the Secondsight and of this Natural Magick before they can be brought about I will entertain the Reader with one or two Passages of that sort likewise and so conclude the History of this so singular a Man's Life and Adventures  In the Year a Gentlewoman lost about six Pounds Worth of  Flanderslace  and inasmuch as it was a Present made to her Husband she was concerned as much as if it had been of twenty Times the Value and a Lady of her Acquaintance coming to visit her to whom she unfolded among other Things in discourse this little Disaster The Lady smiling reply'd with this  Question did you never hear Madam of Mr  Duncan Campbell  It is but making your Application to him Things that are lost are immediately found the Power of his Knowledge exceeds even the Power of Laws they but restrain and frighten and punish Robbers but he makes Thieves expiate their Guilt by the more virtuous Way of turning Restorers of the Goods they have stoln Madam rejoin'd the losing Gentlewoman you smile when you tell me this but really as much a Triflc as it is since 'twas a Present to my Husband I can't help being sensibly concerned at it a Moment's Disappointment to him in the least Thing in Nature creates in me a greater Uneasiness than the greatest Disappointment to my single self could do in Things of Moment and Importance What makes me smile said the Lady when I speak of it or think of it is the Oddness and Peculiarity of this Man's Talent in helping one to such Things but without the least Jest I assure you that I know by Experience these Things come within the Compass of his Knowledge and I must seriously tell you for your farther Satisfaction that he has help'd me and several of my Friends to the finding again Things lost which were of great Value And is this without laughing true said the losing Fair very gravely and demurely like a Person half believing and desirous to be fully confirmed in such a Belief The Lady she  advis'd with did then ascertain her of the Truth of the Matter alledging that for a single half Guinea he would inform her of her Things and describe the Person that convey'd them away No sooner was this Gentlewoman convinc'd but she was eager for the Tryal solicited her Friend to conduct her to Mr  Campbell  and upon the first Word of Consent she was hooded and scarf'd immediately and they coach'd it away in a Trice to Mr  Campbell  's House whom they luckily found within  The Ladies had not been long seated before he wrote down the Name of this new Client of his exactly as it was  viz  Mrs  Saxon  Then she was in good Hopes and with much Confidence propounded to him the Question about the Lace He paused but a very little while upon the Matter before he describ'd the Person that took it and satisfy'd her that in two or three Days she would be Mistriss of her Lace again and find it in some Book or Corner of her Room She presented him a Halfguinea and was very contentedly going away but Mr  Campbell  very kindly stop'd her and signify'd to her that if she had no more to offer to him he had something of more Importance to reveal to her She sate full of Expectation while he wrote this new Matter and the Paper he deliver'd to her contain'd the following Account As for the Loss of a little bit of Lace it is a  mere Trifle you have lost a great many hundreds of Pounds which your Aunt naming her Name left you but you are bubbled out of that large Sum For while you was artfully required down Stairs about some pretended Business or other one Mr  H  tt  n  convey'd your Aunt's Will out of the Desk and several other Things of Value and writing down the Names of all the Persons concern'd which put Mrs  Saxon  in a great Consternation He concluded this Paper with bidding her go home with a contented Mind she should find her Lace in a few Days and as she found that Prediction prove true she should afterwards come and consult about the the Rest  When she came home it seems big at first with the Thoughts of what she had been told she rifled and ransack'd every Corner but no Lace was to be met with all the next Day she hunted in the like manner but frighten'd the whole Time as if she thought the Devil was the only Person could bring it but all to no Purpose the third Day her Curiosity abated she gave over the Hopes of it and took the Prediction as a vain Delusion and that what she gave for it was onmore Money thrown away after what had been lost before That very Day as it commonly happens in such Cases when she least dreamt of it she lighted on't by Accident and Surprize She ran with it in her  Hand immediately to her Husband and now she had recover'd it again told him of the Loss of it and the whole Story of her having been at Mr  Campbell  's about it and then amplifying the Discourse about what he had told her besides as to more considerable Affairs she said she resolv'd to go and consult him a little farther about them and begg'd her Husband to accompany her He would fain have laugh'd her out of that Opinion and Intent but the End was she persuaded him into it and prevailed upon him to seem at least very serious about the Matter and go with her to the Oracle assuring him there was no room for doubting the same Success  Well to Mr  Campbell  's they accordingly came and after Mr  Saxon  in Deference to his Wife's Desire had paid our Predictor a handsome Complement of Gold Mr  Duncan Campbell  saluted him in as grateful a manner with the Assurance that there was in  Kent  a little Country House with some Lands appertaining to it that was his in right of his Wife That he had the House as it were before his Eyes that tho' he had never substantially seen it nor been near the Place where it stood he had seen it figuratively as if in exact Painting and Sculpture that particularly it had four green Trees before the Door from whence he was positive that if Mr  Saxon  went with him in quest  of it he should find it out and know it as well the Moment he come near it as if he had been an Inhabitant in it all his Life  Mr  Saxon  tho' somewhat of an Unbeliever yet must naturally wish to find it true you may be sure and yet partly doubting the Event and partly pleased with the visionary Promise of a Fortune henever expected laugh'd very heartily at the Oddness of the Adventure and said he would consider whether it would not savour too much of  Quixotism  to be at the Expence of a Journey on such Frolicks and on such a chimerical Foundation of airy Hopes and that then he would call again and let Mr  Campbell  know his Mind upon that Point  In every Company he came into it serv'd for Laughter and Diversion they all however agreed 'twas worth his while since the Journey would not be very expensive to go it by way of Frolick His Wife one Morning saying that she did remember some talk of a House and such Things as Mr  Campbell  had describ'd put him forward upon the Adventure and upon Mr  Saxon  's proposing it to his Brother  Barnard  Mr  Barnard  favour'd the Proposal as a Joke and agreed upon the Country Ramble They came on Horseback to Mr  Campbell  's with a third Horse on which the Dumb Predictor was mounted and so on they jogg'd into  Kent  towards  Sevenoak  being the Place which he describ'd The first Day they set out was on a  Saturday  Morning in  June  and about Five that Afternoon they arrived at the  BlackBull  at  Sevenoak  in  Kent  It being a delicate Evening they took an agreeable Walk up a fine Hill gracefully adorn'd with Woods to an old Seat of the Earl of  Dorset  's Meeting by the way with an old Servant of the Earl's one  Perkins  he offer'd Mr  Barnard  who it seems was his old Acquaintance to give them all a Sight of that fine ancient Seat  After they had pleased themselves with viewing the antique Nobility of that stately Structure this  Perkins  went back with them to their Inn the  Bull  at  Sevenoak  They that could talk were very merry in Chat and the Dumb Gentleman who saw them laugh and wear all the Signs of Alacrity in their Countenances was resolv'd not to be behind with their Tongues and by Dint of Pen Ink and Paper that he made Signs should be brought in was resolv'd if one might be said to  crack  without  Noise  to crack his Jest as well as the best of 'em for it may be truly said of him that he seldom comes into any even diverting Company where he is not the most diverting Man there and the Head tho' we can't call him the Mouth of the chearful Society After having ey'd this  Perkins  a little and being grown by his Art as we may suppose as familiar with the Man's Humour as if he had known him as many Years as Mr  Barnard  Pray Mr  Barnard  quoth he in writing how comes it you that are so staunch and so stiff a Whig should be so acquainted and so particularly familiar with such an old  Papist  and so violent a Jacobite as I know that Mr  Perkin  whom I never saw nor had any Notice of in my Life to be And pray reply'd Mr  Barnard  what reason have you beyond a Pun to take him for a Jacobite Must he be so because his Name is  Perkin  I do assure you in this you shew yourself but little of a Conjurer if you can tell no more of Houses than you do of Men we may give over our search after the House you spoke of here the Reader must understand they discoursed on their Fingers and wrote by Turns Mr  Campbell  reply'd seriously laying a Wager is no Argument in other Things I own but in this I know it is because I am sure after we have laid the Wager he will fairly confess it among Friends since it will go no farther and I said Mr  Campbell  will lay what Wager you will apiece with you all round Hereupon Mr  Barnard  who had known him a great many Years was the first that laid and many more to the Number of five or six follow'd his Example the Decision of the Matter was deferr'd till next Day at the Return of the old Man to the Inn they being about to break up that Night and go to Bed  The next Day being  Sunday  the Landlord carry'd his Guests to see the Country and after a handsome Walk they came thro' the Churchyard They were poring upon the Tombs no Delight can be greater to Mr  Campbell  than that and really by the frequent Walks he usually takes in  WestminsterAbbey  and the Churchyards adjacent to this Metropolis one would imagine he takes Delight to stalk along by himself on that dumb silent Ground where the Characters of the Persons are only to be known as his own Meaning is by Writings and Inscriptions on the Marble When they had sufficiently survey'd the Churchyard it grew near Dinnertime and they went homewards but before they had got many Yards out of the Churchyard Mr  Campbell  makes a full Stop pointing up to a House and stopping his Friends a little he pulls out of his Pocket a Pencil and Paper and notes down the following Words  That That is the House my Vision presented to me I could swear it to be the same I know it to be the same I am certain of it  The Gentlemen with him remark'd it would not take any farther notice at that Time intending to inquire into it with Secrecy and so went on to the Inn to Dinner  As merry as they had been the Night before after Supper they were still more innocently chearful this Day after Dinner till the  Time of Service begun When the Duty of the Day was perform'd and over they return'd to divert and unbend their Minds with pleasant but harmless Conversation I suppose no Body but a Set of very great Formalists will be offended with Scandal or Scruples that to Travellers just ready to depart the Town Mr  Perkin  came on that good Day and decided the Wagers by owning to all the Company Secrecy being first enjoined that he was a 'Roman Catholick tho' no Body of the Family knew it in so many Years as he had lived there which was before Mr  Campbell  was born This and other innocent Speeches afforded as much Chearfulness as the Lord's Day would allow of  On the next Day being  Monday  they sent for one Mr  Toland Toler  an Attorney of the Place to find out to whom that House belong'd but by all the Inquiry that could possibly be made with convenient Secrecy no Body could find it out for a long time but at last it came to light and appear'd to be justly to a Tittle as Mr  Campbell  had predicted  Being now satisfy'd the next Day our three Travellers return'd for  London  and the two vocal Men were very jocular upon their Adventure and by their outward Gesticulations gave the prophetical  Mute  his Share of Diversion Mr  Barnard  as they pass'd into a Farmhouseyard remark'd that all the Hogs  fell a grunting and squeaking more and more as Mr  Campbell  came nearer who poor Man could know nothing of the Jest nor the Cause of it till they alighted and told it him by Signs and Writing said to Mr  Saxon  laughing now we have found out our House we shall have only Mr  Campbell  home again by himself we have no farther Need of the Devil that accompany'd him to the Country up to Town with us there are other Devils enow to be met with there he knows and so this according to the Fashion of his Predecessor Devils is enter'd into the Herd of Swine  However the Event of this Journey to cut the Story short procured Mr  Saxon  a great Insight upon inquiry into several Affairs belonging to him of which he would otherwise have had no Knowledge and he is now engaged in a Chancery Suit to do himself Justice and in a fair way of recovering great Sums of Money which without the Consultation he had with this Dumb Gentleman he had in all likelihood never dreamt of  In the Year a Gentleman whose Name shall be in this Place  Amandus  famed for his exquisite Talents in all Arts and Sciences but particularly for his Gentleman like and entertaining manner of Conversation whose Company was affected by all Men of Wit who grew his Friends and courted by all  Ladies of an elegant Taste who grew his Admirers This accomplish'd Gentleman I say came to Mr  Campbell  in order to propound a Question to him which was so very intricate and so difficult to answer that if he did answer it it might administer to himself and the Ladies he brought with him the Pleasure of Admiration in seeing a Thing so wonderful in itself perform'd or on the other hand if he did not make a satisfactory Reply to it then it might afford him and the Ladies a very great Delight in being the first that puzzled a Man who had had the Reputation for so many Years of being capable of baffling all the wittiest Devices and shrewd Stratagems that had been from time to time invented to baffle his Skill and explode his Penetration in the Secondsight and the Arts which he pretended to The Persons whom  Amandus  brought with him were the illustrious Lady  Delphina  distinguish'd for her great Quality but still more celebrated for her Beauty his own Lady the admired  Amabella  and a young blooming pretty Virgin whom we will call by the Name of  Adeodata  about which last Lady the Question was to be put to Mr  Campbell Adeodata  it seems was the natural Daughter of this very fine Gentleman who had never let her into the Knowledge of her own Birth but had bred her up from her Infancy under a borrow'd Name in the  Notion that she was a Relation's Daughter and recommended to his Care in her Infancy Now the Man that had the Secondsight was to be try'd It was now to be put to the Proof if he could tell Names or no  Amandus  was so much an Unbeliever as to be willing to hazard the Discovery  Amabella  and  Delphina  were Strangers to her real Name and ask'd  Duncan Campbell  not doubting but he would set down that which she ordinarily went by  Amabella  had indeed been told by  Amandus  that  Adeodata  was the natural Daughter of a near Friend of his but who this near Friend was remain'd a Secret That was the Point which lay upon our  Duncan Campbell  to discover When the Question was proposed to him what her Name was he look'd at her very stedfastly and shook his Head and after some Time he wrote down that it would be a very difficult Name for him to fix upon And truly so it prov'd he toil'd for every Letter till he sweated and the Ladies laugh'd incontinently imagining that he was in an Agony of Shame and Confusion at finding himself poz'd He desired  Amandus  to withdraw a little for that he could not so well take a full and proper Survey of Ladies Faces when a Gentleman was by This Disturbance and Perplexity of his afforded them still more subject of Mirth and that Excuse was taken as a Pretence and  a putoff to cover his Shame the better and hide from one at least that he was but a downright Bungler in what he pretended to be so wonderful an Artist However after two Hours hard Sweat and Labour and viewing the Face in different Shades and Lights for I must observe to the Reader that there is a vast deal of Difference some he can tell in a Minute or two with Ease some not in less than four or five Hours and that with great Trouble he undeceived them with Regard to his Capacity He wrote down that  Adeodata  's real Name was  Amanda  as being the natural Daughter of  Amandus Delphina  and  Amabella  were surpriz'd at the Discovery and  Amandus  when he was call'd in owning it a Truth his Wife  Amabella  applauded the curious Way of her coming by such a Discovery when  Adeodata  was just marriageable took a Liking to her as if her own Daughter and every Thing ended with Profit Mirth and Chearfulness I could add a thousand more Adventures of Mr  Campbell  's Life but that would prove tedious and as the Town has made a great Demand for the Book it was thought more proper to conclude it here The most diverting of all are to be found best to the Life in original Letters that pass'd between Mr  Campbell  and his Correspondents some select ones of which will be shortly publish'd in a little Pocketvolume for the farther Entertainment of such  Readers as shall relish this Treatise In which the Author hopes he shall be esteem'd to have endeavour'd at the Intermingling of some curious Disquisitions of Learning with entertaining Passages and to have ended all the merriest Passages with a sober instructive and edifying Moral which even to those who are not willing to believe the Stories is reckon'd sufficient to recommend even Fables themselves  THE APPENDIX  _IT is not that Mr  Duncan Campbell  stands in need of my Arguments to prove that he is in no respect liable to the Acts of Parliament made against  Fortunetellers  c that I undertake the writing of this  Appendix  the true Reason thereof being the more completely to finish this Undertaking For having in the Body of the Book it self fully proved a SecondSight and that the same frequently happens to Persons some of them eminently remarkable for Piety and Learning and have from thence accounted for the Manner of Mr  Campbell  's performing those Things he professes to the great Surprize and no less Satisfaction of all the Curious who are pleased to consult him and at the same time proved the Lawfulness of such his Performances  from the Opinions of some of the most Learned in holy Science I thought it not improper to add the following short  Appendix  being a Summary of several Acts of Parliament made against  Fortunetellers Conjurers Egyptians Sorcerers Pretenders to Prophesy  c with some proper Remarks suited to our present Purpose as well to satisfie them who are fantastically Wise and obstinately shut their Eyes against the most refulgent Reason and are wilfully deaf to the most convincing and persuasive Arguments and thereupon cry out that Mr  Campbell  is either an Impostor and a Cheat or at least a Person who acts by the Assistance of unlawful Powers as also to put to silence the no less waspish Curs who are always snarling at such whom Providence has distinguish'd by more excellent Talents than their Neighbours True Merit is always the Mark against which Traducers level their keenest Darts and Wit and Invention oftentimes join Hands with Ignorance and Malice to foil those who excel Art has no greater Enemy than Ignorance and were there no such thing as Vice Virtue would not shine with half its Lustre Did Mr  Campbell  perform those wonderful Things he is so deservedly famous for as these Cavillers say by holding Intelligence with Infernal Powers or by any unjustifiable Means I  am of Opinion he would find very few in this atheistical Age who would open their Mouths against him since none love to act Counter to the Interest of that Master they industriously serve And did he on the other Hand put the Cheat upon the World as they maliciously assert I fancy he would then be more generally admired especially in a Country where the Game is so universally artfully and no less profitably play'd and that with Applause since those Pretenders to Wisdom merrily divide the whole Species of Mankind into the two Classes of Knaves and Fools fixing the Appellation of Folly only upon those whom they think not Wise that is wicked enough to have a Share with them in the profitable Guilt  Our Laws are as well intended by their wise Makers to skreen the Innocent as to punish the Guilty and where their Penalties are remarkably severe the Guilt they punish is of a proportionable size Art which is a Man's Property when acquir'd claims a Protection from those very Laws which false Pretenders thereto are to be try'd and punished by or else all Science would soon have an end for no Man would dare make use of any Talent Providence had lent him and his own industrious Application had improved should he be immediately try'd and condemn'd by those Statutes  which are made to suppress Villains by every conceited and half learned Pedant  'Tis true indeed those excellent Statutes which are made against a sort of People who pretend to Fortunetelling and the like are such as are well warranted as being built upon the best Foundation  viz  Religion and Policy and were Mr  Campbell  guilty of any such Practice as those are made to punish I openly declare that I should be so far from endeavouring to defend his Cause that I would be one of the first that should aggravate his Crime thereby to enforce the speedier Execution of those Laws upon him which are made against such Offenders But when he is so far from acting that he doth not even pretend to any such Practice or for countenancing the same in others as is manifest from the many Detections he has made of that sort of Villany which the Book furnishes us with I think my self sufficiently justified for thus pleading in his Defence  I cannot but take Notice in Reading the Statutes made against such Offenders our wise Legislature hath not in any part of them seem'd so much as to imply that there are in reality any such wicked Persons as they are made against to wit  Conjurers  c but that they are only Pretenders to those infernal Arts as may reasonably be  inferr'd from the Nature of the Penalties they inflict for our first Laws of that sort only inflicted a Penalty which affected the Goods and Liberty of the Guilty and not their Lives tho' indeed they were afterwards forced to heighten the Punishment with a Halter not that they were better convinc'd as I humbly conceive but because the Criminals were most commonly Persons who had no Goods to forfeit and to whom their Liberty was no otherwise valuable but as it gave them the opportunity of doing Mischief Indeed our LawBooks do furnish us with many Instances of Persons who have been try'd and executed for Witchcraft and Sorcery but then the wiser part of Mankind have taken the Liberty to condemn the Magistrate at that time of Day of too much Inconsideration and the Juries of an equal share of Credulity And those who have suffer'd for such Crimes have been commonly Persons of the lowest Rank whose Poverty might occasion a Dislike of them in their FellowCreatures and their too artless Defence subject them to their mistaken Justice so that upon the whole I take the Liberty to conclude and I hope not without good Grounds that those Laws were made to deter Men from an idle Pretence to mysterious and unjustifiable Arts which if too closely pursued commonly lead them into the darkest Villany not only that of deceiving others but  as far as in them lye making themselves Slaves to the Devil And not to prevent and hinder Men from useful Enquiries and from the Practice of such Arts which tho' they are in themselves mysterious yet are and may be lawful  I would not however be thought in contradiction to my former Arguments to assert that there never were or that there now are no Persons such as Wizards Sorcerers  c  for by so doing I should be as liable to be censur'd for my Incredulity as those who defame Mr  Campbell  on that Account are for their want of Reason and common Honesty Holy and prophane Writ I confess furnishes us with many Instances of such Persons but we must not from thence hastily infer that all those Men are such who are spightfully branded with the odious Guilt for were it in the Devil's Power to make every wicked Man a Wizard and Woman a Witch he soon would have Agents enough to shake this lower World to Atoms but the Almighty who restrains him likewise restrains those  Having premised thus much I shall now proceed to consider some of the Acts of Parliament themselves the Persons against whom they were made and the Necessity of making the same And some of the first Acts we meet with were those which were made against a sort of People called  Egyptians  Persons who if in reality such might if any be suspected of practising what we call the  Black Art  the same having been for many Ages encouraged in their Country nay so much has it been by them favour'd that it was introduced into their superstitious Religion if I may without an Absurdity call it so and made an essential Part thereof And I believe  Mahometism  has not much mended the Matter since it has imperiosly reigned there or in any respect reform'd that idolatrous Nation Now the Mischief these Persons might do being so much in the Devil's Power among the unwary was thought too considerable not to be provided against and therefore our wise Legislature the more effectually to prevent the same by striking at the very Foundation made an Act in the  H  VIII That if any calling themselves  Egyptians  do come into this Realm they shall forfeit all their Goods and being demanded shall depart the Realm within fifteen Days upon pain of Imprisonment and the Importers of them by another Act were made liable to a heavy Penalty This Act was continu'd by the  P  and  M Conjuration Witchcraft Inchantment  and  Sorcery  to get Money or consume any Person in his Body Members or Goods or to provoke any Person to unlawful Love was by the  H  VIII and the  Eliz  and the  Jac  I made  Felony and by the same  H  VIII it was made Felony to declare to another any  false Prophesies  upon Arms  c  but this Act was repealed by the  Ed  VI but by another Act of the and of  Ed  VI it was again enacted that all such Persons who should pretend to  Prophesies  c should upon Conviction for the first Offence forfeit Ten Pounds and one Year's Imprisonment and for the second Offence all his Goods and Imprisonment for Life And by the  Ed  VI the same was made to continue but 'till the then next Sessions of Parliament And by the  Eliz  the same Act was again renewed against  fantastical Prophesiers  c but both those Acts were repealed by the  Jac  I  Thus far we find that for Reasons of State and for the Punishment of particular Persons those Acts were made and repealed as occasion required and not kept on foot or indeed were they ever made use of as I can remember in my reading against any Persons whose Studies led them into a useful Enquiry into the Nature of Things or a lawful Search into the Workings of Nature itself by which means many Things are foretold long before they come to pass as Eclipses and the like which Astrologers successfully do whose Art has been in all Ages held in so great Esteem that the first Monarchs of the East made it their peculiar  Study by which means they deservedly acquired to themselves the Name of  Magi  or Wise Men but on the contrary were provided against Persons profligate and loose who under a Pretence and Mask of Science commit vile and roguish Cheats and this will the more plainly appear if we consider the Letter and express Meaning of the following Acts wherein the Persons I am speaking of are described by such Characters which sufficiently prove the Assertion For in the of  Eliz  it was enacted That all Persons calling themselves Scholars going about begging seafaring Men pretending Losses of their Ships and Goods at Sea and going about the Country begging or using any subtile Craft feigning themselves to have Knowledge in  Phisiognomy Palmistry  or any other the like crafty Science or pretending that they can tell  Destinies Fortunes  or such like  fantastical Imaginations  shall be taken and deem'd  Rogues Vagabonds sturdy Beggars  and shall be stripp'd naked from the Middle upwards and whip'd till his or her Body be bloody And by the  Jam  for the better restraining of the said Offences and for the farther punishing the same it was farther enacted That any Person or Persons using  Witchcraft Sorcery  c and all their Aiders Abettors and Counsellors being convicted and attainted of the same Offences shall suffer Pain of Death as Felons without the Benefit of Clergy  Or to tell and declare in what place any Treasure of Gold and Silver should or might be found in the Earth or other secret Places Or where Goods or Things lost or stol'n should be found or become Or to provoke any Person to unlawful Love such Offender to suffer Imprisonment for one whole Year without Bail or Mainprize and once in every Quarter of the said Year shall in some MarketTown or upon the MarketDay or at any such Time as any Fair shall be kept there stand openly in the Pillory by the Space of six Hours and there shall openly confess his or their Offence and for the second Offence shall suffer Death as Felons without the Benefit of Clergy  That these Laws were made against a Set of Villains whose natural Antipathy to Honesty and Labour furnish'd them with Pretensions to an uncommon Skill thereby the more easily to gull and cheat the superstitiously credulous and by that means discover from them some such Secrets that might farther them in perpetrating the more consummate Villany is plain from the very Words and Expressions of the very Acts themselves and the Description of the Persons they are made against and not as I before observed to prevent and hinder Men from the lawful Inquiry after useful delightful and profitable Knowledge  Mr  Campbell  who has been long a settled and reputable Inhabitant in many eminent  Parts of the City of  London  cannot I am sure be look'd upon as one of those these Acts of Parliament were made against unless we first strip the Acts themselves of their own natural express and plain Meaning and cloath them with that which is more obscure unnatural forced and constrain'd a Practice which if allowed would make them wound the Innocent and clear the Guilty and render them not our Defence but our greatest Evil they would by that means become a perfect  Aenigma  and be so far from being admired for their Plainness that they would be even exploded like the Oracles of the Heathen for their double Meaning  If Mr  Campbell  has the SecondSight as is unquestionable from the allowed Maxim that what has been may be again and by that means can take a View of Contingencies and future Events so long as he confines these Notices of approaching Occurrences to a good Purpose and makes use of them only innocently and charitably to warn Persons from doing such Things that according to his Conceptions would lead them into Misfortune or else in putting them upon such Arts that may be of Use and Benefit to themselves and Posterity always having a strict Regard to Morality and Religion to which he truly adheres Certainly I think he ought so much the more to be admired for the same by how much the more this his excellent Knowledge  is surpassing that of other Men and not be therefore unjustly upbraided with the injurious Character of a Cheat or an ill Man however this I will presume to affirm and I doubt not but to have my Opinion confirm'd by the learned Sages of the Law that this his innocent Practice and I venture to add honest one too doth by no means intitle him to the Penalties of the beforementioned Laws made against Fortune tellers and such sort of profligate Wretches which it is as great an Absurdity to decry as it would be to call him who is a settled and reputable Inhabitant a Stroller or wandring Beggar  Again It is true that Mr  Campbell  has relieved many that have been supposed to have been Bewitched as is related and well attested in the Book of his Life but will any one from thence argue that he himself is a real Conjurer or Wizard because he breaks the Chains by which those unhappy Wretches were bound No surely for if that were the Case we might then as well indict the Physician who drives away a malignant Distemper and roots out its latent Cause by his mysterious Skill in Plants and Drugs or conclude that the Judge who condemns a Criminal is for the same Reason guilty of the selfsame Crime for which the Offender is so by him condemned Persons who delight in such unnatural Conclusions must certainly be in Love with the greatest Absurdities and must intirely abandon  their natural Reason before they can be brought to conclude that the Prince of Darkness would assist Men in destroying his own Power  The best Answer I can afford those Men is Silence for if they will not argue upon the Principles of Reason or be guided by her Dictates I think them no more fit to be contended with in a rational and decent manner than Bedlamites and such who are bereft of all Understanding A Rod is the best Argument for the back of a Fool and Contempt the best Usage that ought to be shewn to every headstrong and ignorant Opponent  In a word I know of no Branch of Mr  Campbell  's Practice that bears the least Resemblance to those Crimes mentioned in the foregoing Acts That he can and doth tell Peoples Names at first Sight tho' perfect Strangers to him is confessed by all who have made the curious Enquiry at his Hands but what part of the Acts I would fain know is that against Knowledge and a clear Sight into things not common is not only an allowable but a commendable Qualification and whether this Knowledge in him be inherent accidental or the result of a long Study the Case is still the same since we are assured he doth it by no unlawful Intelligence or makes use of the same to any ill purpose and therefore is undoubtedly as lawful as to draw natural Conclusions from right Premisses Hard is the Fate of any  Man to be ignorant but much harder would his Lot be if he were to be punished for being Wise and like Mr  Campbell  excelling others in this kind of Knowledge  Much more might be said in Defence of Mr  Campbell  and the Art he professeth but as the Arguments which are brought against him by his Enemies on the one hand are trivial and illgrounded I therefore think they deserve no farther Refutation so on the other his Innocency is too clear to require it  After having thus taken a Survey of Mr  Campbell  's Acts with regard to their Legality according to the Statutes and the Laws of the Nation wherein he lives we will consider next whether according to the stated Rules of Casuistry among the great Divines eminent for their Authority it may be lawful for Mr  Campbell  to predict or for good Christian Persons to visit his House and consult him about his Predictions I have upon this Head examin'd all the learnedest Casuists I could meet with in ancient Times for I cannot meet in my reading with any Moderns that treat thoroughly upon this Case or I should rather have chosen them because perhaps the SeondSight was less known in those antient Days than it has been since and so might escape their Notice  My Design is first to give the Reader a distinct Summary of all that has been said of this Matter and to do it as succinctly and  briefly as possible and then to argue myself from what they agree upon as to this Man's particular Case  That the Reader may have recourse to the Authors themselves if they have a Curiosity and find that I don't go about to impose upon their Judgments I will here tell the Reader where he may find the whole Contents of the following little Abstract of Divinity and Casuistry because it would be a tedious piece of Work to set down the Words of each of them distinctly and quote them every one round at the end of their several different Sentences which tend to the same Meaning but I will strictly keep to the Sense of them all and I here give the Reader their Names and the Places that he may consult them himself if his Inclination leads him to be so curious Thomas Aquinas  Distin    quaestio    Art  Bona  Dist    Art    Quaest  Joannes Major  Dist    quaest  Sylvester  Verbo Malefico quaest  Rosella  Verb Impedimentum    cap  Tabiena  Verb Imped    Vers  Cajetan  Tom    Opusc    de Malefic  Alphonsus  a Cast Lib    de Justâ Haereticorum punitione cap  Cosmus Philiarchus  de Offic Sacerdot  p  cap  Toletus  in Summa  lib  cap  Spineus  in Tract de Strigibus  Petrus Binsfield  in Tract de Confessionibus Maleficorum  These Divines have generally written upon impious Arts of Magick which they call by the Name of Divination and this Divination as they term it they divide into two Kinds the  One  in which the Devil is  expresly  invoked to teach hidden and occult things the  Other  in which he is  tacitly  called upon to do the same An  express  Invocation is by Word or Deed by which a real Pact is actually made with the Devil and that is a Sin that affects the Death of the Soul according to the Laws of Theology and ought to effect the Death of the Body according to Civil and Political Laws The  tacit  Invocation of Daemons is then only when a Man busies himself so far with such Persons that it is meet and just that the Devil should be permitted to have to do with him though it was opposite to the Intention of the Man  But then this  express  Invocation again is subdivided into several Species according to the diverse manners by which the Devil instructs these Men  The first is  Enchantment  which I need not describe and of which I will speak no more because it is what every Body knows to be detestable and no Body ought to know the Art thereof  The second is  Divination  by Dreams when any Instructions are expected from the Devil by way of Dream which is a capital Crime  The third is called  Necromancy  which is when by the use of Blood and Writing or Speaking certain Verses the Dead seem to rise again and speak and teach future things For tho' the Devil can't recal a Soul departed yet he can as some have thought take the Shape of the dead Corpse himself actuate it by his Subtilty as if it was inform'd with a Soul And some affirm that by the Divine Permission the Devil can do this and spake so in the Case of  Samuel  and  Saul  But Divines of a more solid Genius attribute that Power only to the Deity and say with Reason that it is beyond the Devil's Capacity But it is certain this was a Divination done in dead Animals by the Use of their Blood and therefore the word is derived from the Greek  which significs Dead and  which signifies Divination  The fourth Species is called  Divination  by the  Pythians  which was taken from  Apollo  the first Diviner  as Thomas Aquinas  says in his  Secundâ secundae qu    Artic    The fifth is called  Geomancy  which is when the Devil teaches any thing by certain Signs appearing in the earthly Bodies as in Wood Iron or polishd Stones Berylls or Glass  The Sixth is named  Hydromancy  as when a Daemon teaches any thing by Appearances in the Water  The seventh is stiled  Aeromancy  and 'tis when he informs People of such things by Figures in the Air  The eighth is entituled  Pyromancy  that is when it instructs People by Forms appearing in the Fire  The ninth is termed  Aruspicy  which is when by Signs appearing in the Bowels of sacrificed Animals the Daemon predicts at Altars  Thus far as to  express  Divination or Invocation of the Devil which is detestable and the very consulting of Persons that use such unlawful Means is according to the Judgment of all Casuists the high Road to eternal Damnation  Now as to  tacit  Divination or Invocation of the Devil that is divided into two subaltern Kinds The first Kind is when for the sake of knowing hidden things they make use of a vain and superstitious Disposition existing in things to judge from which Disposition is not of a sufficient Virtue to lead them to any real Judgment The second Kind of  tacit Divination  is when that Knowledge is sought by the Disposition of those things which Men effect on purpose and of their own accord in order to come by and acquire that Knowledge  Both these kinds of  tacit  Divination are again subdivided into several Species as are particularly mentioned by St  Thomas Secundâ Secundoe  Quaest Artic  Gregory de Valentine  Tomo Disput quaest Puncto  Toletus  in Summâ Lib cap And  Michael Medina  Lib  de rectâ in  Deumfide post sanctum Augustinum  Lib  de Doct Christ  cap  sequen  The first of these Kinds of tacit Divination contains under it the following several Species  The first Species is called  Genethliacal  which is when from the Movement or Situation of the Stars Mens Nativities are calculated and enquired into so far as that from such a Search they pretend to deduce the Knowledge of human Effects and the contingent Events that are to attend them This  Thomas Aquinas  and  Sixtus Quintus  condemns but I shall with Humility and Submission to greater Judgments enquire hereafter into their Reasons and give my Opinion why I think this no evil Art but I submit my Opinion if after it is given it is thought erroneous  The second is  Augury  when any thing is predicted from the chattering of Birds or the voice of Animals and this may be either lawful or unlawful If it comes from natural Instinct for Brutes having only a sensitive Soul have their Organs subject to the Disposition of the greater Bodies in which they are contained and principally of all to the Celestial Bodies his  Augury  is not amiss For if when Crows are remark'd to Kaw as the Vulgar Phrase is more than ordinary it is judging according to the Instinct of their Nature if we expect Rain and we may reasonably depend upon it we shall be right if we foretel Rain to be at hand But sometimes the Devils actuate  those Brute Animals to excite vain Ideas in Men contrary to what the Instinct of their Nature compels them to This is superstitious and unlawful and forbid in holy Writ  The third is  Aruspicy  when from the Flight of Birds or any other Motion of any Animals whatsoever Persons pretend to have an Insight and a penetrative Knowledge into occult and hidden Matters  The fourth consists in  Omens  when for Example a Man from any Words which others may have spoken on purpose or by accident pretends to gather a way of looking into and knowing any thing of Futurity  The fifth is  Chiromancy  which consists in making a pretence to the Knowledge of future things by the Figures and the Lines of the Hands And if it be by consulting the Shoulderbones of any Beast it goes by the name of  Spatulamancy  As the first kind of Divination by a  tacit  Invocation of the Devil is divided into the five Species above mentioned so also is the second kind of  tacit  Divination or Invocation of the Devil divided into two Species by St  Thomas  of  Aquin Secunda secundae quaestione nonagesimâ quintâ articulo tertio  and too tedious to insert here  Now all these ways are by these Divines counted wicked and I set them down that People may avoid them For how many Gypsies and Pretenders to  Chyromancy  have we in  London  and in the Country How many that are for  Hydromancy  that pretend in Water to shew Men mighty Mysteries And how many in  Geomancy  with their Berylls and their Glasses that if they are not under the Instigation of the Devil propagate the Scandal at least by being Cheats and who ought to be punish'd to the utmost Severity as our  English  Laws enact Mr  Campbell  who hates contemns and abhors these ways ought methinks to be encouraged by their being restrain'd and People of curious Tempers who always receive from him moral and good Instructions which make 'em happy in the Conduct of Life should be animated in a publick Manner to consult him in order to divert the curious Itch of their Humours from consulting such wicked Impostors or diabolical Practicers as too frequently abound in this Nation by reason of the inquisitive Vulgar who are more numerous in our Climate than any I ever read of  But now to argue the case of Conscience with Regard to his  particular  Practice by way of the SecondSight whether  in foro Conscientiae  it is lawful for him to follow it or others to consult him The Divines abovementioned having never had any notice of that Faculty in all likelihood or if they had never mentioning it makes it a point more difficult for me to discuss but I think they have stated some Cases by the making of  which my Premisses I can deduce from all the learned Men I have above quoted a Conclusion in favour of our Mr  Duncan Campbell  and of those who consult him but my Opinion shall be always corrected by those who are wiser than my self and to whom I owe entire Submission I take leave to fix these Premisses from them first and to form my Argument from them afterwards in the following manner  First  It is allowed by all these Divines that a Knowledge which one may have of future Things within the Order of Nature is and may be lawful  Secondly  They imply that where Justice is not violated it is lawful both to predict and to consult  Thirdly  Many of them but particularly  Aureolus  puts this Question Is it lawful to go to one that deals in the Black Art to persuade them to cure any innocent Body that another  Necromancer  or Dealer in the Black Art may have maliciously afflicted and tormented with Pains And some of these Casuists particularly  Aureolus  say it is lawful on such an Occasion to go to such a Conjurer because the end is not Conjuration but freeing a Person from it  But I take leave to dissent from these great Men and think they are in a double Mistake  first in stating the Question and then in making such an Answer provided the Question had been stated right  The Question is founded upon this Supposition which is past by as granted  viz  that one  Necromancer  could release a Person bewitched by another which is absolutely false for it's against the Nature of the Devil to be made an Instrument to undo his own Works of Impiety But admitting and not granting this to be possible and the Question to be rightly stated why still these Casuists are out in their Answer It is lawful reply they because the end of going to the Conjurers is not Conjuration but freeing a good Person from it But the end is not the Point here to be consider'd it is the Medium which is bad that is to be consider'd It is by Conjuration according to their Hypothesis the other Conjuration is to be dissolved and does not the common Rule that a Man must not do Evil that Good may come of it forbid this Practice And to speak my Opinion plainly in that case the Friend that should consult a Conjurer for that end would be only so kind to put his own Soul in danger of being guilty of Helltorments to relieve his afflicted Friend from some bodily Pains which 'twould be a Virtue in him to suffer with Patience and Resignation  Others almost all Divines indeed agree that it is and may be lawful to go to a Conjurer  that torments another and give him Money not to afflict the Patient any longer because that's only feeing him to desist from acting after his conjuring manner  These Premisses thus settled if we allow the  SecondSight  to be inborn and inbred and natural and common to some Families which is proved in the Book and if all that Mr  Campbell  has predicted in that Secondsighted way terminates with moral Advice and the Profit of the Consulter and without the Violation of Justice to others as the Book shews all throughout if he can relieve from Witchcraft as it seems Oath is to be had he can which no one that deals in Black Art can do why then I need not draw the Conclusion every Reader will do it naturally they will avow all the strictest Laws of Casuistry and Morality to be in favour of Mr  Campbell  and his Consulters  FINIS
