Tonson  within  GraysInn Gate  next  GraysInn Lane    A HYMN TO HARMONY In HONOUR of St  CECILIA  's Day  MDCCI  I  O  Harmony  to thee we sing  To thee the grateful Tribute bring  Of Sacred Verse and sweet resounding Lays  Thy Aid invoking while thy Pow'r we praise  All Hail to thee  Allpow'rful  Harmony  Wise Nature owns thy undisputed Sway  Her wond'rous Works resigning to thy Care  The Planetary Orbs thy Rule obey  And tuneful roll unerring in their way  Thy Voice informing each melodious Sphere  CHORUS  All Hail to thee  Allpow'rful  Harmony  II  Thy Voice O  Harmony  with awful Sound  Could penetrate th' Abyss profound  Explore the Realms of ancient Night  And search the living Source of unborn Light  Confusion heard thy Voice and fled  And  Chaos  deeper plung'd his vanquish'd Head  Then didst thou  Harmony  give birth  To this fair form of Heav'n and Earth  Then all those Shining Worlds above  In Mystick Dance began to move  Around the radiant Sphere of Central Fire  A never ceasing never silent Choir  CHORUS  Confusion heard thy Voice and fled  And  Chaos  deeper plung'd his vanquish'd Head  III  Thou only Goddess first could'st tell  The mighty Charms in Numbers found  And didst to Heav'nly Minds reveal  The secret force of tuneful Sound  When first  Cyllenius  form'd the Lyre  Thou didst the God inspire  When first the vocal Shell he strung  To which the Muses sung  Then first the Muses sung melodious Strains  Apollo  plaid  And Musick first begun by thy auspicious Aid  Hark hark again  Urania  sings  Again  Apollo  strikes the trembling Strings  And see the list'ning Deities around  Attend insatiate and devour the Sound  CHORUS  Hark hark again  Urania  sings  Again  Apollo  strikes the trembling Strings  And see the list'ning Deities around  Attend insatiate and devour the Sound  IV  Descend  Urania  Heav'nly Fair  To the relief of this afflicted World repair  See how with various Woes opprest  The wretched Race of Men is worn  Consum'd with cares with doubts distrest  Or by conflicting Passions torn  Reason in vain employs her Aid  The furious Will on Fancy waits  While Reason still by Hopes or Fears betray'd  Too late advances or too soon retreats  Musick alone with suddain Charms can bind  The wand'ring Sense and calm the troubled Mind  CHORUS  Musick alone with suddain Charms can bind  The wand'ring Sense and calm the troubled Mind  V  Begin the pow'rful Song yee Sacred Nine  Your Instruments and Voices join  Harmony Peace and sweet Desire  In ev'ry Breast inspire  Revive the melancholy drooping Heart  And soft Repose to restless Thoughts impart  Appease the wrathful Mind  To dire Revenge and Death inclin'd  With balmy Sounds his boiling Blood asswage  And melt to mild Remorse his burning Rage  'Tis done and now tumultuous Passions cease  And all is husht and all is Peace  The weary World with welcome Ease is blest  By Musick lull'd to pleasing Rest  CHORUS  'Tis done and now tumultuous Passions cease  And all is husht and all is Peace  The weary World with welcome Ease is blest  By Musick lull'd to pleasing Rest  VI  Ah sweet Repose too soon expiring  Ah foolish Man new Toils requiring  Curs'd Ambition Strife pursuing  Wakes the World to War and Ruin  See see the Battle is prepar'd  Behold the Hero comes  Loud Trumpets with shrill Fifes are heard  And hoarse resounding Drums  War with discordant Notes and jarring Noise  The Harmony of Peace destroys  CHORUS  War with discordant Notes and jarring Noise  The Harmony of Peace destroys  VII  See the forsaken fair with streaming Eyes  Her parting Lover mourn  She weeps she sighs despairs and dies  And watchful wastes the lonely livelong Nights  Bewailing past Delights  That may no more no never more return  O sooth her Cares  With softest sweetest Airs  'Till Victory and Peace restore  Her faithful Lover to her tender Breast  Within her folding Arms to rest  Thence never to be parted more  No never to be parted more  CHORUS  Let Victory and Peace restore  Her faithful Lover to her tender Breast  Within her folding Arms to rest  Thence never to be parted more  No never to be parted more  VIII  Enough  Urania  heav'nly fair  Now to thy Native Skies repair  And rule again the Starry Sphere  Cecilia  comes with holy Rapture fill'd  To ease the World of Care  Cecilia  more than all the Muses skill'd  Phoebus  himself to her must yield  And at her Feet lay down  His Golden Harp and Lawrel Crown  The soft enervate Lyre is drown'd  In the deep Organ's more majestick Sound  In peals the swelling Notes ascend the Skies  Perpetual Breath the swelling Notes supplies  And lasting as her Name  Who form'd the tuneful Frame  Th' immortal Musick never dies  Grand CHORUS  Cecilia  more than all the Muses skill'd  Phoebus  himself to her must yield  And at her Feet lay down  His Golden Harp and Lawrel Crown  The soft enervate Lyre is drown'd  In the deep Organ's more majestick Sound  In peals the swelling Notes ascend the Skies  Perpetual Breath the swelling Notes supplies  And lasting as her Name  Who form'd the tuneful Frame  Th' immortal Musick never dies  FINIS  Books Printed for  Jacob Tonson  at  GraysInn
