 THE NUN AN ELEGY By the AUTHOR of the MAGDALENS  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY at Tully'sHead PallMall MDCCLXIV Price Six Pence  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP STANHOPE EARL of CHESTERFIELD THIS ELEGY IS WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT INSCRIBED BY HIS LORDSHIP's OBLIGED AND HUMBLE SERVANT  THE AUTHOR  THE NUN  WITH each Perfection dawning on her Mind  All Beauty's Treasure opening on her Cheek  Each flatt'ring Hope subdued each Wish resign'd  Does gay  Ophelia  this lone Mansion seek  Say gentle Maid what prompts Thee to forsake  The Paths thy Birth and Fortune strew with Flow'rs  Thro' Nature's kind endearing Ties to break  And waste in cloyster'd Walls thy pensive Hours  Let sober Thought restrain thine erring Zeal  That guides thy Footsteps to the Vestal Gate  Lest thy soft Heart this Friendship bids reveal  Like mine unblest shou'd mourn like mine too late  Does some angelic lonelywhisp'ring Voice  Some sacred Impulse or some Dream divine  Approve the Dictates of thy early Choice  Approach with Confidence the aweful Shrine  There kneeling at yon Altar's marble Base  While Tears of Rapture from thine Eyelid steal  And smiling Heav'n illumes thy Soul with Grace  Pronounce the Vow Thou never can'st repeal  Yet if misled by falseentitled Friends  Who say"That Peace with all her comely Train  "From starry Regions to this Clime descends  "Smooths ev'ry Frown and softens ev'ry Pain  "That Vestals tread Contentment's flow'ry Lawn  "Approv'd of Innocence by Health carest  "That rob'd in Colours bright by Fancy drawn  "Celestial Hope sits smiling at their Breast"  Suspect their Syren Song and artful Style  Their pleasing Sounds some treach'rous Thought conceal  Full oft does Pride with sainted Voice beguile  And sordid Int'rest wear the Mask of Zeal  A TyrantAbbess here perchance may reign  Who fond of Pow'r affects th' Imperial Nod  Looks down disdainful on her Female Train  And rules the Cloyster with an Iron Rod  Reflection sickens at the Lifelong Tie  Backglancing Mem'ry acts her busy Part  Its Charms the World unfolds to Fancy's Eye  And sheds Allurement on the wishful Heart  Lo Discord enters at the sacred Porch  Rage in her Frown and Terror on her Crest  Ev'n at the hallow'd Lamps she lights her Torch  And holds it flaming to each Virgin Breast  But since the Legends of Monastic Bliss  By Fraud are fabled and by Youth believ'd  Unbought Experience learn from my Distress  Oh mark my Lot and be no more deceiv'd  Three Lustres scarce with hasty Wing were fled  When I was torn from ev'ry weeping Friend  A thoughtless Victim to the Temple led  And blush ye Parents by a Father's Hand  Yet then what solemn Scenes deceiv'd my Choice  The pealing Organ's animating Sound  The choral Virgins' captivating Voice  The blazing Altar and the Priests around  The Train of Youths array'd in purest white  Who scatter'd Myrtles as I pass'd along  The thousand Lamps that pour'd a Flood of Light  The Kiss of Peace from all the Vestal Throng  The Golden Censers toss'd with graceful Hand  Whose fragrant Breath  Arabian  Odor shed  Of meekey'd Novices the circling Band  With blooming Chaplets wove around their Head  My willing Soul was caught in Rapture's Flame  While sacred Ardor glow'd in ev'ry Vein  Methought applauding Angels sung my Name  And Heav'n's unsullied Glories gilt the Fane  This temporary Transport soon expir'd  My drooping Heart confess'd a dreadful Void  E'er since alas abandon'd uninspir'd  I tread this Dome to Misery allied  No wakening Joy informs my sullen Breast  Thro' opening Skies no radiant Seraph smiles  No Saint descends to sooth my Soul to Rest  No Dream of Bliss the dreary Night beguiles  Here hagard Discontent still haunts my View  The sombre Genius reigns in ev'ry Place  Arrays each Virtue in the darkest Hue  Chills ev'ry Pray'r and cancels ev'ry Grace  I meet her ever in the chearless Cell  The gloomy Grotto and unsocial Wood  I hear her ever in the Midnight Bell  The hollow Gale and hoarseresounding Flood  This caus'd a Mother's tender Tears to flow  The sad Remembrance Time shall ne'er erase  When having seal'd th' irrevocable Vow  I hasten'd to receive her last Embrace  Fullwell she then presag'd my wretched Fate  Th' unhappy Moments of each future Day  When lock'd within this Terrorshedding Grate  My joydeserted Soul wou'd pine away  Yet ne'er did her maternal Voice unfold  This cloyster'd Scene in all its Horror drest  Nor did she then my trembling Steps withhold  When here I enter'd a reluctant Guest  Ah could she view her only Child betray'd  And let Submission o'er her Love prevail  Th' unfeeling Priest why did she not upbraid  Forbid the Vow and rend the hov'ring Veil  Alas she might notHer relentless Lord  Had seal'd her Lips and chid her streaming Tear  So Anguish in her Breast conceal'd its Hoard  And all the Mother sunk in dumb Despair  But Thou who own'st a Father's sacred Name  What Act impell'd thee to this ruthless Deed  What Crime had forfeited my filial Claim  And giv'n oh blasting Thought thy Heart to bleed  If then thine injur'd Child deserve thy Care  Oh haste and bear her from this lonesome Gloom  In vainno Words can sooth his rigid Ear  And  Gallia  's Laws have riveted my Doom  Ye cloister'd Fairye censurebreathing Saints  Suppress your Taunts and learn at length to spare  Tho' mid these holy Walls I vent my Plaints  And give to Sorrow what is due to Pray'r  I fled not to this Mansion's deep Recess  To veil the Blushes of a guilty Shame  The Tenor of an illspent Life redress  And snatch from Infamy a sinking Name  Yet let me to my Fate submissive bow  From fatal Symptoms if I right conceive  This Stream  Ophelia  has not to flow  This Voice to murmur and this Breast to heave  Ah when extended on th' untimely Bier  To yonder Vault this Form shall be convey'd  Thoul't not refuse to shed one grateful Tear  And breathe the  Requiem  to my fleeting Shade  With pious Footstep join the sable Train  As thro' the lengthening Isle they take their Way  A glimmering Taper let thy Hand sustain  Thy soothing Voice attune the funeral Lay  Behold the Minister who lately gave  The sacred Veil in Garb of mournful Hue  More friendly Office bending o'er my Grave  And sprinkling my Remains with hallow'd Dew  As o'er the Corse he strews the rattling Dust  The sternest Heart will raise Compassion's Sigh  Ev'n then no longer to his Child unjust  The Tears may trickle from  a Father's  Eye  FINIS
