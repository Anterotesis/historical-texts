 A LETTER FROM EDMUND BURKE  Esq  One of the Representatives in Parliament for the City of BRISTOL TO JOHN FARR and JOHN HARRIS Esqrs Sheriffs of that City ON THE AFFAIRS OF AMERICA  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY in PALLMALL MDCCLXXVII  A LETTER c  GENTLEMEN  I HAVE the honour of sending you the two last acts which have been passed with regard to the troubles in America These acts are similar to all the rest which have been made on the same subject They operate by the same principle and they are derived from the very same policy I think they complete the number of this sort of statutes to nine It affords no matter for very pleasing reflection to observe that our subjects diminish as our laws encrease  If I have the misfortune of differing with some of my fellowcitizens on this great and arduous subject it is no small consolation to me that I do not differ from you With you  I am perfectly united We are heartily agreed in our detestation of a civil war We have ever expressed the most unqualified disapprobation of all the steps which have led to it and of all those which tend to prolong it And I have no doubt that we feel exactly the same emotions of grief and shame on all its miserable consequences whether they appear on the one side or the other in the shape of victories or defeats of captures made from the English on the continent or from the English in these islands of legislative regulations which subvert the liberties of our brethren or which undermine our own  Of the first of these statutes that for the letter of marque I shall say little Exceptionable as it may be and as I think it is in some particulars it seems the natural perhaps necessary result of the measures we have taken and the situation we are in The other for a partial suspension of the  Habeas Corpus  appears to me of a much deeper malignity During its progress through the House of Commons it has been amended so as to express more distinctly than at first it did the avowed sentiments of those who framed it and the main ground of my exception to it is because it does express and does carry into execution purposes which appear to me so contradictory to all the principles not only of the constitutional policy of Great Britain but  even of that species of hostile justice which no asperity of war wholly extinguishes in the minds of a civilized people  It seems to have in view two capital objects the first to enable administration to confine as long as it shall think proper within the duration of the act those whom that act is pleased to qualify by the name of  Pirates  Those so qualified I understand to be the commanders and mariners of such privateers and ships of war belonging to the colonies as in the course of this unhappy contest may fall into the hands of the crown They are therefore to be detained in prison under the criminal description of piracy to a future trial and ignominious punishment whenever circumstances shall make it convenient to execute vengeance on them under the colour of that odious and infamous offence  To this first purpose of the law I have no small dislike Because the act does not as all laws and all equitable transactions ought to do fairly describe its object The persons who make a naval war upon us in consequence of the present troubles may be  rebels  but to call and treat them as  pirates  is confounding hot only the natural distinction of things but the order of crimes which whether by putting them from a higher part of the scale to the lower or from the lower to the higher is  never done without dangerously disordering the whole frame of jurisprudence Though piracy may be in the eye of the law a  less  offence than treason yet as both are in effect punished with the same death the same forfeiture and the same corruption of blood I never would take from any fellowcreature whatever any sort of advantage which he may derive to his safety from the pity of mankind or to his reputation from their general feelings by degrading his offence when I cannot soften his punishment The general sense of mankind tells me that those offences which may possibly arise from mistaken virtue are not in the class of infamous actions Lord Coke the oracle of the English law conforms to that general sense where he says that  "those things which are of the highest criminality may be of the least disgrace"  The act prepares a sort of masqued proceeding not honourable to the justice of the kingdom and by no means necessary for its safety I cannot enter into it If lord Balmerino in the last rebellion had driven off the cattle of twenty clans I should have thought it a scandalous and low juggle utterly unworthy of the manliness of an English judicature to have tried him for felony as a stealer of cows  Besides I must honestly tell you that I could not votefor or countenance in any way a statute which stigmatizes with the crime of  piracy those men whom an act of parliament had previously put out of the protection of the law When the legislature of this kingdom had ordered all their ships and goods for the mere newcreated offence of exercising trade to be divided as a spoil among the seamen of the navyfor the same legislature afterwards to treat the necessary reprisal of an unhappy proscribed interdicted people as the crime of piracy seems harsh and incongruous Such a procedure would have appeared in any other legislature than ours a strain of the most insulting and most unnatural cruelty and injustice I assure you I do not remember to have heard of any thing like it in any time or country  The second professed purpose of the act is to detain in England for trial those who shall commit high treason in America  That you may be enabled to enter into the true spirit of the present law it is necessary gentlemen to apprise you that there is an act made so long ago as the reign of Henry the eighth before the existence or thought of any English colonies in America for the trial in this kingdom of treasons committed out of the realm In the year parliament thought proper to acquaint the crown with their construction of that act in a formal address wherein they intreated his Majesty to cause persons charged with high treason in America to be brought into this kingdom for trial By  this act of Henry the eighth  so construed and so applied  almost all that is substantial and beneficial in a trial by jury is taken away from the subject in the colonies This is however saying too little for to try a man under that act is in effect to condemn him unheard A person is brought hither in the dungeon of a ship's hold thence he is vomited into a dungeon on land loaded with irons unfurnished with money unsupported by friends three thousand miles from all means of calling upon or confronting evidence where no one local circumstance that tends to detect perjury can possibly be judged ofsuch a person may be executed according to form but he can never be tried according to justice  I therefore could by no means reconcile myself to the bill I send you which is expressly provided to remove all inconveniences from the establishment of a mode of trial which has ever appeared to me most unjust and most unconstitutional Far from removing the difficulties which impede the execution of so mischievous a project I would heap new difficulties upon it if it were in my power All the ancient honest juridical principles and institutions of England are so many clogs to check and retard the headlong course of violence and oppression They were invented for this one good purposethat what was not just should not be convenient Convinced of this I would  leave things as I found them The old coolheaded general law is as good as any deviation dictated by present heat  I could see no fair justifiable expedience pleaded to favour this new suspension of the liberty of the subject If the English in the colonies can support the independency to which they have been unfortunately driven I suppose nobody has such a fanatical zeal for the criminal justice of Henry the eighth that he will contend for executions which must be retaliated tenfold on his own friends or who has conceived so strange an idea of English dignity as to think the defeats in America compensated by the triumphs at Tyburn If on the contrary the colonies are reduced to the obedience of the crown there must be under that authority tribunals in the country itself fully competent to administer justice on all offenders But if there are not and that we must suppose a thing so humiliating to our government as that all this vast continent should unanimously concur in thinking that no ill fortune can convert resistance to the royal authority into a criminal act we may call the effect of our victory peace or obedience or what we will but the war is not ended The hostile mind continues in full vigour and it continues under a worse form If your peace be nothing more than a sullen pause from arms if their quiet be nothing  but the meditation of revenge where smitten pride smarting from its wounds festers into new rancour neither the act of Henry the eighth nor its handmaid of this reign will answer any wise end of policy or justice For if the bloody fields which they saw and felt are not sufficient to subdue the reason of Americans to use the expressive phrase of a great lord in office it is not the judicial slaughter which is made in another hemisphere against their universal sense of justice that will ever reconcile them to the British government  I take it for granted gentlemen that we sympathize in a proper horror of all punishment further than as it serves for an example To whom then does the example of an execution in England for this American rebellion apply Remember you are told every day that the present is a contest between the two countries and that we in England are at war for  our own  dignity against our rebellious children Is this true If it be it is surely among such rebellious children that examples for disobedience should be made For who ever thought of instructing parents in their duty by an example from the punishment of a disobedient son As well might the execution of a fugitive negro in the plantations be considered as a lesson to teach masters humanity to their slaves Such executions may indeed satiate our revenge they may  harden our hearts and puff us up with pride and arrogance Alas this is not instruction  If anything can be drawn from such examples by a parity of the case it is to shew how deep their crime and how heavy their punishment will be who shall at any time dare to resist a distant power actually disposing of their property without their voice or consent to the disposition and overturning their franchises without charge or hearing God forbid that England should ever read this lesson written in the blood of  any  of her offspring  War is at present carried on between the king's natural and foreign troops on one side and the English in America on the other upon the usual footing of other wars and accordingly an exchange of prisoners has been regularly made from the beginning If notwithstanding this hitherto equal procedure upon some prospect of ending the war with success which however may be delusive administration prepares to act against those as  traitors  who remain in their hands at the end of the troubles in my opinion we shall exhibit to the world as indecent a piece of injustice as ever civil fury has produced If the prisoners who have been exchanged have not by that exchange been  virtually pardoned  the cartel  whether avowed or understood is a cruel fraud for you have received the life of a man and you ought to return a life for it or there is no parity or fairness in the transaction  If on the other hand we admit that they who are actually exchanged are pardoned but contend that we may justly reserve for vengeance those who remain unexchanged then this unpleasant and unhandsome consequence will follow that you judge of the delinquency of men merely by the time of their guilt and not by the heinousness of it and you make fortune and accidents and not the moral qualities of human action the rule of your justice  These strange incongruities must ever perplex those who confound the unhappiness of civil dissention with the crime of treason Whenever a rebellion really and truly exists which is as easily known in fact as it is difficult to define in words government has not entered into such military conventions but has ever declined all intermediate treaty which should put rebels in possession of the law of nations with regard to war Commanders would receive no benefits at their hands because they could make no return for them Who has ever heard of capitulation and parole of honour and exchange of prisoners in the late rebellions in this kingdom The answer to all demands of that sort was  "we can engage for nothing you are at the king's pleasure"  We ought to remember that if our present enemies be in reality and truth rebels the king's generals have no right to release them upon any conditions whatsoever and they are themselves answerable to the law and as much in want of a pardon for doing so as the rebels whom they release  Lawyers I know cannot make the distinction for which I contend because they have their strict rule to go by But legislators ought to do what lawyers cannot for they have no other rules to bind them but the great principles of reason and equity and the general sense of mankind These they are bound to obey and follow and rather to enlarge and enlighten law by the liberality of legislative reason than to fetter and bind their higher capacity by the narrow constructions of subordinate artificial justice If we had adverted to this we never could consider the convulsions of a great empire not disturbed by a little disseminated faction but divided by whole commuities and provinces and entire legal representatives of a people as fit matter of discussion under a commission of oyer and terminer It is as opposite to reason and prudence as it is to humanity and justice  This act proceeding on these principles that is preparing to end the present troubles  by a trial of one sort of hostility under the name of piracy and of another by the name of treason and executing the act of Henry the eighth according to a new and unconstitutional interpretation I have thought evil and dangerous even though the instruments of effecting such purposes had been merely of a neutral quality  But it really appears to me that the means which this act employs are at least as exceptionable as the end Permit me to open myself a little upon this subject because it is of importance to me when I am obliged to submit to the power without acquiescing in the reason of an act of legislature that I should justify my dissent by such arguments as may be supposed to have weight with a sober man  The main operative regulation of the act is to suspend the common law and the statute  Habeas Corpus  the sole securities either for liberty or justice with regard to all those who have been out of the realm or on the high seas within a given time The rest of the people as I understand are to continue as they stood before  I confess gentlemen that this appears to me as bad in the principle and far worse in its consequence than an universal suspension of the  Habeas Corpus  act and the limiting  qualification instead of taking out the sting does in my humble opinion sharpen and envenom it to a greater degree Liberty if I understand it at all is a  general  principle and the clear right of all the subjects within the realm or of none Partial freedom seems to me a most invidious mode of slavery But unfortunately it is the kind of slavery the most easily admitted in times of civil discord For parties are but too apt to forget their own future safety in their desire of sacrificing their enemies People without much difficulty admit the entrance of that injustice of which they are not to be the immediate victims In times of high proceeding it is never the faction of the predominant power that is in danger for no tyranny chastises its own instruments It is the obnoxious and the suspected who want the protection of law and there is nothing to bridle the partial violence of state factions but this great steady uniform principle  "that whenever an act is made for a cessation of law and justice the whole people should be universally subjected to the same suspension of their franchises"  The alarm of such a proceeding would then be universal It would operate as a sort of  call of the nation  It would become every man's immediate and instant concern to be made very sensible of  the absolute necessity  of this total eclipse of liberty They would more carefully advert to every renewal and more powerfully resist it These great determined measures are not commonly  so dangerous to freedom They are marked with too strong lines to slide into use No plea or pretence of mere  inconvenience or evil example  which must in their nature be daily and ordinary incidents can be admitted as a reason for such mighty operations But the true danger is when liberty is nibbled away for expedients and by parts The  Habeas Corpus  act supposes contrary to the genius of most other laws that the lawful magistrate may see particular men with a malignant eye and it provides for that identical case But when men  in particular descriptions marked out by the magistrate himself  are delivered over by parliament to this possible malignity it is not the  Habeas Corpus  that is occasionally suspended but its spirit that is mistaken and its principle that is subverted Indeed nothing is security to any individual but the common interest of all  This act therefore has this distinguished evil in it that it is the first  partial  suspension of the  Habeas Corpus  which has been made The precedent which is always of very great importance is now established For the first time a distinction is made among the people within this realm Before this act every man putting his foot on English ground every stranger owing only a local and temporary allegiance even a negro slave who had been sold in the colonies and under an act of parliament  became as free as every other man who breathed the same air with him Now a line is drawn which may be advanced further and further at pleasure on the same argument of mere expedience on which it was first described There is no equality among us we are not fellowcitizens if the mariner who lands on the quay does not rest on as firm legal ground as the merchant who sits in his comptinghouse Other laws may injure the community this tends to dissolve it It destroys  equality  which is the essence of community As things now stand every man in the West Indies every one inhabitant of three unoffending provinces on the continent every person coming from the East Indies every gentleman who has travelled for his health or education every mariner who has navigated the seas is for no other offence under a temporary proscription Let any of these facts now become presumptions of guilt be proved against him and the bare suspicion of the crown puts him out of the law It is even by no means clear to me whether the negative proof does not lie upon the person apprehended on suspicion to the subversion of all justice  I have not debated against this bill in its progress through the House because it would have been vain to oppose and impossible to correct it It is some time since I have been clearly convinced that in the present state of things all opposition to any measures proposed  by ministers where the name of America appears is vain and frivolous You may be sure that I do not speak of my opposition which in all circumstances must be so but that of men of the greatest wisdom and authority in the nation Every thing proposed  against  America is supposed of course to be  in favour  of Great Britain Good and ill success are equally admitted as reasons for persevering in the present methods Several very prudent and very well intentioned persons were of opinion that during the prevalence of such dispositions all struggle tended rather to inflame than to abate the distemper of the public counsels Finding such resistance to be considered as factious by most within doors and by very many without I could not conscientiously support what is against my opinion nor prudently contend with what I know is irresistible  Preserving my principles unshaken I reserve my activity for rational endeavours and I hope my past conduct has given sufficient evidence that if I am a single day from my place it is not owing to indolence or love of dissipation The slightest hope of doing good is sufficient to recal me to a station which I quitted with regret In declining my usual strict attendance I do not in the least condemn the spirit of those gentlemen who with a just confidence in their abilities in which I claim a sort of share from my love and admiration of them were of opinion that their exertions in this desperate case might be of some service  They thought that by contracting the sphere of its application they might lessen the malignity of an evil principle Perhaps they were in the right But when my opinion was so very clearly to the contrary for the reasons I have just stated I am sure  my  attendance would have been ridiculous  I must add in further explanation of my conduct that far from softening the features of such a principle and thereby removing any part of the popular odium or natural terrors attending it I should be sorry that any thing framed in contradiction to the spirit of our constitution did not instantly produce in fact the grossest of the evils with which it was pregnant in its nature It is by lying dormant a long time or being at first very rarely exercised that arbitrary power steals upon a people On the next unconstitutional act all the fashionable world will be ready to sayYour prophecies are ridiculous your fears are vain you see how little of the mischiefs which you formerly foreboded are come to pass Thus by degrees that artful softening of all arbitrary power the alledged infrequency or narrow extent of its operation will be received as a sort of aphorismand Mr  Hume  will not be singular in telling us that the felicity of mankind is no more disturbed by it than by earthquakes or thunder  or the other more unusual accidents of nature  The act of which I have said so much is among the fruits of the American war a war in my humble opinion productive of many mischiefs of a kind which distinguish it from all others Not only our policy is deranged and our empire distracted but our laws and our legislative spirit are in danger of being totally perverted by it We have made war on our Colonies not by arms only but by laws As hostility and law are not very concordant ideas every step we have taken in this business has been made by trampling on some maxim of justice or some capital principle of wise government What precedents were established and what principles overturned I will not say of English privilege but of general justice in the Boston Port the Massachusets Charter the Military Bill and all that long array of hostile acts of parliament by which the war with America has been begun and supported Had the principles of any of these acts been first planted on English ground they would probably have expired as soon as they touched it But by being removed from our persons they have rooted in our laws and the latest posterity will taste the fruits of them  Nor is it the worst effect of this unnatural contention that our  laws  are corrupted Whilst  manners  remain entire they will correct the vices of law and soften it at length to their own temper But we have to lament that in most of the late proceedings we see very few traces of that generosity humanity and dignity of mind which formerly characterized this nation War suspends the rules of moral obligation and what is long suspended is in danger of being totally abrogated Civil wars strike deepest of all into the manners of a people They vitiate their politicks they corrupt their morals they pervert even the natural taste and relish of equity and justice By teaching us to consider our fellowcitizens in an hostile light the whole body of our nation becomes gradually less dear to us The very names of affection and kindred which were the bond of charity whilst we agreed become new incentives to hatred and rage when the communion of our country is dissolved We may flatter ourselves that we shall not fall into this misfortune But we have no charter of exemption that I know of from the ordinary frailties of our nature  What but that blindness of heart which arises from the phrensy of civil contention could have made any persons conceive the  present situation of the British affairs as an object of triumph to themselves or of congratulation to their sovereign Nothing surely could be more lamentable to those who remember the flourishing days of this kingdom than to see the insane joy of several unhappy people amidst the sad spectacle which our affairs and conduct exhibit to the scorn of Europe We behold and it seems some people rejoice in beholding our native land which used to sit the envied arbiter of all her neighbours reduced to a servile dependence on their mercy acquiescing in assurances of friendship which she does not trust complaining of hostilities which she dares not resent deficient to her allies lofty to her subjects and submissive to her enemies whilst the liberal government of this free nation is supported by the hireling sword of German boors and vassals and three millions of the subjects of GreatBritain are seeking for protection to English privileges in the arms of France  These circumstances appear to me more like shocking prodigies than natural changes in human affairs Men of firmer minds may see them without staggering or astonishmentSome may think them matters of congratulation and complimentary addresses but I trust your candour will be so indulgent to my weakness as not to have the worse opinion of  me for my declining to participate in this joy and my rejecting all share whatsoever in such a triumph I am too old too stiff in my inveterate partialities to be ready at all the fashionable evolutions of opinion I scarcely know how to adapt my mind to the feelings with which the Court Gazettes mean to impress the people It is not instantly that I can be brought to rejoice when I hear of the slaughter and captivity of long lists of those names which have been familiar to my ears from my infancy and to rejoice that they have fallen under the sword of strangers whose barbarous appellations I scarcely know how to pronounce The glory acquired at the  White Plains  by  Colonel Raille  has no charms for me and I fairly acknowledge that I have not yet learned to delight in finding  Fort Kniphausen  in the heart of the British dominions  It might be some consolation for the loss of our old regards if our reason were enlightened in proportion as our honest prejudices are removed Wanting feelings for the honour of our country we might then in cold blood be brought to think a little of our interests as individual citizens and our private conscience as moral agents  Indeed our affairs are in a bad condition I do assure those Gentlemen who have prayed  for war and obtained the blessing they have sought that they are at this instant in very great straits The abused wealth of this country continues a little longer to feed its distemper As yet they and their German allies of twenty hireling states have contended only with the unprepared strength of our own infant colonies But America is not subdued Not one unattacked village which was originally adverse throughout that vast continent has yet submitted from love or terror You have the ground you encamp on and you have no more The cantonments of your troops and your dominions are exactly of the same extent You spread devastation but you do not enlarge the sphere of authority  The events of this war are of so much greater magnitude than those who either wished or feared it ever looked for that this alone ought to fill every considerate mind with anxiety and diffidence Wise men often tremble at the very things which fill the thoughtless with security For many reasons I do not choose to expose to public view all the particulars of the state in which you stood with regard to foreign powers during the whole course of the last year Whether you are yet wholly out of danger from those powers is more than I know or than your rulers can divine But even if I were certain of my safety I could not easily forgive those  who had brought me into the most dreadful perils because by accidents unforeseen by them or me I have escaped  Believe me gentlemen the way still before you is intricate dark and full of perplexed and treacherous mazes Those who think they have the clue may lead us out of this labyrinth We may trust them as amply as we think proper But as they have most certainly a call for all the reason which their stock can furnish why should we think it proper to disturb its operation by inflaming their passions I may be unable to lend an helping hand to those who direct the state but I should be ashamed to make myself one of a noisy multitude to hollow and hearten them into doubtful and dangerous courses A conscientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood He would feel some apprehension at being called to a tremendous account for engaging in so deep a play without any sort of knowledge of the game It is no excuse for presumptuous ignorance that it is directed by insolent passion The poorest being that crawls on earth contending to save itself from injustice and oppression is an object respectable in the eyes of God and man But I cannot conceive any existence under heaven which in the depths of its wisdom tolerates all sorts of things that is more truly odious and disgusting than an impotent helpless creature  without civil wisdom or military skill without a consciousness of any other qualification for power but his servility to it bloated with pride and arrogance calling for battles which he is not to fight contending for a violent dominion which he can never exercise and satisfied to be himself mean and miserable in order to render others contemptible and wretched  If you and I find our talents not of the great and ruling kind our conduct at least is conformable to our faculties No man's life pays the forfeit of our rashness No desolate widow weeps tears of blood over our ignorance Scrupulous and sober in our wellgrounded distrust of ourselves we would keep in the port of peace and security and perhaps in recommending to others something of the same diffidence we shew ourselves more charitable to their welfare than injurious to their abilities  There are many circumstances in the present zeal for civil war which seem to discover but little of real magnanimity The addressers offer their own persons and they are satisfied with hiring Germans They promise their private fortunes and they mortgage their country They have all the merit of volunteers without risque of person or charge of contribution and when the unfeeling arm of a foreign soldiery pours out their kindred blood like water they exult and triumph as if they themselves had  performed some notable exploit I am really ashamed of the fashionable language which has been held for some time past which to say the best of it is full of levity You know that I allude to the general cry against the cowardice of the Americans as if we despised them for not making the King's soldiery purchase the advantages they have obtained at a dearer rate It is not Gentlemen it is not to respect the dispensations of Providence nor to provide any decent retreat in the mutability of human affairs It leaves no medium between insolent victory and infamous defeat It tends to alienate our minds further and further from our natural regards and to make an eternal rent and schism in the British nation Those who do not wish for such a separation would not dissolve that cement of reciprocal esteem and regard which can alone bind together the parts of this great fabrick It ought to be our wish as it is our duty not only to forbear this style of outrage ourselves but to make every one as sensible as we can of the impropriety and unworthiness of the tempers which gave rise to it and which designing men are labouring with such malignant industry to diffuse amongst us It is our business to counteract them if possible if possible to awake our natural regards and to revive the old partiality to the English name Without something of this kind I do not see how it is ever practicable really to reconcile with those  whose affections after all must be the surest hold of our government and which are a thousand times more worth to us than the mercenary zeal of all the circles of Germany  I can well conceive a country completely overrun and miserably wasted without approaching in the least to settlement In my apprehension as long as English government is attempted to be supported over Englishmen by the sword alone things will thus continue I anticipate in my mind the moment of the final triumph of foreign military force When that hour arrives for it may arrive then it is that all this mass of weakness and violence will appear in its full light If we should be expelled from America the delusion of the partizans of military government might still continue They might still feed their imaginations with the possible good consequences which might have attended success Nobody could prove the contrary by facts But in case the sword should do all that the sword can do the success of their arms and the defeat of their policy will be one and the same thing You will never see any revenue from America Some increase of the means of corruption without any ease of the public burthens is the very best that can happen Is it for this that we are at war and in such a war  As to the difficulties of laying once more the foundations of that government which for  the sake of conquering what was our own has been voluntarily and wantonly pulled down by a court faction here I tremble to look at them Has any of these Gentlemen who are so eager to govern all mankind shewed himself possessed of the first qualification towards government some knowledge of the object and of the difficulties which occur in the task they have undertaken  I assure you that on the most prosperous issue of your arms you will not be where you stood when you called in war to supply the defects of your political establishment Nor would any disorder or disobedience to government which could arise from the most abject concession on our part ever equal those which will be felt after the most triumphant violence You have got all the intermediate evils of war into the bargain  I think I know America If I do not my ignorance is incurable for I have spared no pains to understand it and I do most solemnly assure those of my Constituents who put any sort of confidence in my industry and integrity that every thing that has been done there has arisen from a total misconception of the object that our means of originally holding America that our means of reconciling with it after quarrel of recovering it after separation of keeping it after victory did depend and  must depend in their several stages and periods upon a total renunciation of that unconditional submission which has taken such possession of the minds of violent men The whole of those maxims upon which we have made and continued this war must be abandoned Nothing indeed for I would not deceive you can place us in our former situation That hope must be laid aside But there is a difference between bad and the worst of all Terms relative to the cause of the war ought to be offered by the authority of parliament An arrangement at home promising some security for them ought to be made By doing this without the least impairing of our strength we add to the credit of our moderation which in itself is always strength more or less  I know many have been taught to think that moderation in a case like this is a sort of treason and that all arguments for it are sufficiently answered by railing at rebels and rebellion and by charging all the present or future miseries which we may suffer on the resistance of our brethren But I would wish them in this grave matter and if peace is not wholly removed from their hearts to consider seriously firstthat to criminate and recriminate never yet was the road to reconciliation in any difference amongst men In the next place it would be right to reflect  that the American English whom they may abuse if they think it honourable to revile the absent can as things now stand neither be provoked at our railing or bettered by our instruction All communication is cut off between us But this we know with certainty that though we cannot reclaim them we may reform ourselves If measures of peace are necessary they must begin somewhere and a conciliatory temper must precede and prepare every plan of reconciliation Nor do I conceive that we suffer any thing by thus regulating our own minds We are not disarmed by being disencumbered of our passions Declaiming on Rebellion never added a bayonet or a charge of powder to your military force but I am afraid that it has been the means of taking up many a musket against you  This outrageous language which has been encouraged and kept alive by every art has already done incredible mischief For a long time even amidst the desolations of war and the insults of hostile laws daily accumulated on one another the American leaders seem to have had the greatest difficulty in bringing up their people to a declaration of total independence But the Court Gazette accomplished what the abettors of independence had attempted in vain When that disingenuous compilation and strange medley of railing and flattery was adduced as a proof of the united sentiments  of the people of Great Britain there was a great change throughout all America The tide of popular affection which had still set towards the parent country began immediately to turn and to flow with great rapidity in a contrary course Far from concealing these wild declarations of enmity the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence insists largely on the multitude and the spirit of these Addresses and he draws an argument from them which if the fact were as he supposes must be irresistible For I never knew a writer on the theory of government so partial to authority as not to allow that the  hostile mind  of the rulers to their people did fully justify a change of government Nor can any reason whatever be given why one people should voluntarily yield any degree of preeminence to another but on a supposition of great affection and benevolence towards them Unfortunately your rulers trusting to other things took no notice of this great principle of connexion From the beginning of this affair they have done all they could to alienate your minds from your own kindred and if they could excite hatred enough in one of the parties towards the other they seemed to be of opinion that they had gone half way towards reconciling the quarrel  I know it is said that your kindness is only alienated on account of their resistance and  therefore if the colonies surrender at discretion all sort of regard and even much indulgence is meant towards them in future But can those who are partizans for continuing a war to enforce such a surrender be responsible after all that has passed for such a future use of a power that is bound by no compacts and restrained by no terrors Will they tell us what they call indulgences Do they not at this instant call the present war and all its horrors a lenient and merciful proceeding  No conqueror that I ever heard of has  professed  to make a cruel harsh and insolent use of his conquest No The man of the most declared pride scarcely dares to trust his own heart with this dreadful secret of ambition But it will appear in its time and no man who professes to reduce another to the insolent mercy of a foreign arm ever had any sort of goodwill towards him The profession of kindness with that sword in his hand and that demand of surrender is one of the most provoking acts of his hostility I shall be told that all this is lenient as against rebellious adversaries But are the leaders of their faction more lenient to those who submit Lord Howe and General Howe have powers under an Act of Parliament to restore to the King's peace and to free trade any men or district which shall submit Is this done We have been over and over informed by the  authorised Gazette that the city of New York and the countries of Staten and Long Island have submitted voluntarily and cheerfully and that many in these places are full even of zeal to the cause of Administration Were they instantly restored to trade Are they yet restored to it Is not the benignity of two commissioners naturally most humane and generous men some way fettered by instructions equally against their dispositions and the spirit of parliamentary faith when Mr Tryon vaunting of the fidelity of the City in which he is Governor is obliged to apply to ministry for leave to protect the King's loyal subjects and to grant to them not the disputed rights and privileges of freedom but the common rights of men by the name of  Graces  Why do not the commissioners restore them on the spot Were they not named as commissioners for that express purpose But we see well enough to what the whole leads The trade of America is to be dealt out in  private indulgences and graces  that is in jobbs to recompence the incendiaries of war  They  will be informed of the proper time in which to send out their merchandise From a national the American trade is to be turned into a personal monopoly and one set of Merchants are to be rewarded for the pretended zeal of which another set are the dupes and thus between craft and credulity the voice of reason is stifled and all the misconduct all the calamities of the war are covered and continued  If I had not lived long enough to be little surprized at any thing I should have been in some degree astonished at the continued rage of several Gentlemen who not satisfied with carrying fire and sword into America are animated nearly with the same fury against those neighbours of theirs whose only crime it is that they have charitably and humanely wished them to entertain more reasonable sentiments and not always to sacrifice their interest to their passion All this rage against unresisting dissent convinces me that at bottom they are far from satisfied they are in the right For what is it they would have A war They certainly have at this moment the blessing of something that is very like one and if the war they enjoy at present be not sufficiently hot and extensive they may shortly have it as warm and as spreading as their hearts can desire Is it the force of the Kingdom they call for They have it already and if they choose to fight their battles in their own person no body prevents their setting sail to America in the next transports Do they think that the service is stinted for want of liberal supplies Indeed they complain without reason The table of the House of Commons will glut them let their appetite for expence be never so keen And I assure them further that those who think with them in the House of Commons are full as easy in the  control as they are liberal in the vote of these expences If this be not supply or confidence sufficient let them open their own private purse strings and give from what is left to them as largely and with as little care as they think proper  Tolerated in their passions let them learn not to persecute the moderation of their fellowcitizens If all the world joined them in a full cry against rebellion and were as hotly inflamed against the whole theory and enjoyment of freedom as those who are the most factious for servitude it could not in my opinion answer any one end whatsoever in this contest The leaders of this war could not hire to gratify their friends one German more than they do or inspire him with less feeling for the persons or less value for the privileges of their revolted brethren If we all adopted their sentiments to a man their allies the savage Indians could not be more ferocious than they are They could not murder one more helpless woman or child or with more exquisite refinements of cruelty torment to death one more of their English flesh and blood than they do already The public money is given to purchase this allianceand they have their bargain  They are continually boasting of unanimity or calling for it But before this unanimity  can be matter either of wish or congratulation we ought to be pretty sure that we are engaged in a rational pursuit Phrensy does not become a slighter distemper on account of the number of those who may be infected with it Delusion and weakness produce not one mischief the less because they are universal I declare that I cannot discern the least advantage which could accrue to us if we were able to persuade our Colonies that they had not a single friend in Great Britain On the contrary if the affections and opinions of mankind be not exploded as principles of connexion I conceive it would be happy for us if they were taught to believe that there was even a formed American party in England to whom they could always look for support Happy would it be for us if in all tempers they might turn their eyes to the parent state so that their very turbulence and sedition should find vent in no other place than this I believe there is not a man except those who prefer the interest of some paltry faction to the very being of their country who would not wish that the Americans should from time to time carry many points and even some of them not quite reasonable by the aid of any denomination of men here rather than they should be driven to seek for protection against the fury of foreign mercenaries and the waste of savages in the arms of France  When any community is subordinately connected with another the great danger of the connexion is the extreme pride and selfcomplacency of the superior which in all matters of controversy will probably decide in its own favour It is a powerful corrective to such a very rational cause of fear if the inferior body can be made to believe that the party inclination or political views of several in the principal state will induce them in some degree to counteract this blind and tyrannic partiality There is no danger that any one acquiring consideration or power in the presiding state should carry this leaning to the inferior too far The fault of human nature is not of that sort Power in whatever hands is rarely guilty of too strict limitations on itself But one great advantage to the support of authority attends such an amicable and protecting connexion that those who have conferred favours obtain influence and from the foresight of future events can persuade men who have received obligations sometimes to return them Thus by the mediation of those healing principles call them good or evil troublesome discussions are brought to some sort of adjustment and every hot controversy is not a civil war  But if the Colonies to bring the general matter home to us could see that in Great Britain the mass of the people is melted into its Government and that every dispute with the  Ministry must of necessity be always a quarrel with the nation they can stand no longer in the equal and friendly relation of fellowcitizens to the subjects of this Kingdom Humble as this relation may appear to some when it is once broken a strong tie is dissolved Other sort of connexions will be sought For there are very few in the world who will not prefer an useful ally to an insolent master  Such discord has been the effect of the unanimity into which so many have of late been seduced or bullied or into the appearance of which they have sunk through mere despair They have been told that their dissent from violent measures is an encouragement to rebellion Men of great presumption and little knowledge will hold a language Which is contradicted by the whole course of history  General  rebellions and revolts of an whole people never were  encouraged  now or at any time They are always  provoked  But if this unheardof doctrine of the encouragement of rebellion were true if it were true that an assurance of the friendship of numbers in this country towards the colonies could become an encouragement to them to break off all connexion with it what is the inference Does any body seriously maintain that charged with my share of the public councils I am obliged not to resist projects which I think mischievous lest men who suffer should be encouraged  to resist The very tendency of such projects to produce rebellion is one of the chief reasons against them Shall that reason not be given Is it then a rule that no man in this nation shall open his mouth in favour of the Colonies shall defend their rights or complain of their sufferings Or when war finally breaks out no man shall express his desires of peace Has this been the law of our past or is it to make the terms of our future connexion Even looking no further than ourselves can it be true loyalty to any government or true patriotism towards any country to degrade their solemn councils into servile drawingrooms to flatter their pride and passions rather than to enlighten their reason and to prevent them from being cautioned against violence lest others should be encouraged to resistance By such acquiescence great Kings and mighty nations have been undone and if any are at this day in a perilous situation from rejecting truth and listening to flattery it would rather become them to reform the errors under which they suffer than to reproach those who have forewarned them of their danger  But the rebels looked for assistance from this country They did so in the beginning of this controversy most certainly and they sought it by earnest supplications to Government which dignity rejected and by a suspension of commerce  which the wealth of this nation enabled you to despise When they found that neither prayers nor menaces had any sort of weight but that a firm resolution was taken to reduce them to unconditional obedience by a military force they came to the last extremity Despairing of us they trusted in themselves Not strong enough themselves they sought succour in France In proportion as all encouragement here lessened their distance from this country encreased The encouragement is over the alienation is compleat  In order to produce this favourite unanimity in delusion and to prevent all possibility of a return to our antient happy concord arguments for our continuance in this course are drawn from the wretched situation itself into which we have been betrayed It is said that being at war with the Colonies whatever our sentiments might have been before all ties between us are now dissolved and all the policy we have left is to strengthen the hands of Government to reduce them On the principle of this argument the more mischiefs we suffer from any administration the more our trust in it is to be confirmed Let them but once get us into a war their power is then safe and an act of oblivion past for all their misconduct  But is it really true that Government is always to be strengthened with the instruments of war but never furnished with the means of peace In former times ministers I allow have been sometimes driven by the popular voice to assert by arms the national honour against foreign powers But the wisdom of the nation has been far more clear when those ministers have been compelled to consult its interests by treaty We all know that the sense of the nation obliged the Court of King Charles the d to abandon the  Dutch war  a war next to the present the most impolitic which we ever carried on The good people of England considered Holland as a sort of dependency on this Kingdom they dreaded to drive it to the protection or to subject it to the power of France by their own inconsiderate hostility They paid but little respect to the court jargon of that day They were not inflamed by the pretended rivalship of the Dutch in trade by their Massacre at Amboyna acted on the stage to provoke the public vengeance nor by declamations against the ingratitude of the United Provinces for the benefits England had conferred upon them in their infant state They were not moved from their evident interest by all these arts nor was it enough to tell them they were at war that they must go through with it and that the cause of the dispute was lost in the consequences The people of England were  then as they are now called upon to make government strong They thought it a great deal better to make it wise and honest  When I was amongst my constituents at the last Summer Assizes I remember that men of all descriptions did then express a very strong desire for peace and no slight hopes of attaining it from the commission sent out by my lord Howe And it is not a little remarkable that in proportion as every person shewed a zeal for the court measures he was at that time earnest in circulating an opinion of the extent of the supposed powers of that commission When I told them that lord Howe had no powers to treat or to promise satisfaction on any point whatsoever of the controversy I was hardly credited so strong and general was the desire of terminating this war by the method of accommodation As far as I could discover this was the temper then prevalent through the kingdom The king's forces it must be observed had at that time been obliged to evacuate Boston The superiority of the former campaign rested wholly with the Colonists If such powers of treaty were to be wished whilst success was very doubtful how came they to be less so since his Majesty's arms have been crowned with many considerable advantages Have these successes induced us to alter our mind as thinking the season of victory not the time  for treating with honour or advantage Whatever changes have happened in the national character it can scarcely be our wish that terms of accommodation never should be proposed to our enemy except when they must be attributed solely to our fears It has happened let me say unfortunately that we read of his Majesty's commission for making peace and his troops evacuating his last town in the thirteen colonies at the same hour and in the same Gazette It was still more unfortunate that no commission went to America to settle the troubles there until several months after an act had been passed to put the colonies out of the protection of this government and to divide their trading property without a possibility of restitution as spoil among the seamen of the navy The most abject submission on the part of the colonies could not redeem them There was no man on that whole continent or within three thousand miles of it qualified by law to follow allegiance with protection or submission with pardon A proceeding of this kind has no example in history Independency and independency with an enmity which putting ourselves out of the question would be called natural and much provoked was the inevitable consequence How this came to pass the nation may be one day in an humour to enquire  All the attempts made this session to give fuller powers of peace to the commanders in America were stifled by the fatal confidence of victory and the wild hopes of unconditional submission There was a moment favourable to the king's arms when if any powers of concession had existed on the other side of the Atlantick even after all our errors peace in all probability might have been restored But calamity is unhappily the usual season of reflexion and the pride of men will not often suffer reason to have any scope until it can be no longer of service  I have always wished that as the dispute had its apparent origin from things done in Parliament and as the acts passed there had provoked the war that the foundations of peace should be laid in Parliament also I have been astonished to find that those whose zeal for the dignity of our body was so hot as to light up the flames of civil war should even publickly declare that these delicate points ought to be wholly left to the Crown Poorly as I may be thought affected to the authority of Parliament I shall never admit that our constitutional rights can ever become a matter of ministerial negociation  I am charged with being an American If warm affection towards those over whom I claim any share of authority be a crime I  am guilty of this charge But I do assure you and they who know me publickly and privately will bear witness to me that if ever one man lived more zealous than another for the supremacy of Parliament and the rights of this imperial Crown it was myself Many others indeed might be more knowing in the extent or in the foundation of these rights I do not pretend to be an Antiquary or a Lawyer or qualified for the chair of Professor in Metaphysics I never ventured to put your solid interests upon speculative grounds My having constantly declined to do so has been attributed to my incapacity for such disquisitions and I am inclined to believe it is partly the cause I never shall be ashamed to confess that where I am ignorant I am diffident I am indeed not very sollicitous to clear myself of this imputed incapacity because men even less conversant than I am in this kind of subtleties and placed in stations to which I ought not to aspire have by the mere force of civil discretion often conducted the affairs of great nations with distinguished felicity and glory  When I first came into a publick trust I found your Parliament in possession of an unlimited legislative power over the Colonies I could not open the StatuteBook without seeing the actual exercise of it more or less in all cases whatsoever This possession passed  with me for a title It does so in all human affairs No man examines into the defects of his title to his paternal estate or to his established government Indeed common sense taught me that a legislative authority not actually limited by the express terms of its foundation or by its own subsequent acts cannot have its powers parcelled out by argumentative distinctions so as to enable us to affirm that here they can and there they cannot bind Nobody was so obliging as to produce to me any record of such distinctions by compact or otherwise either at the successive formation of the several Colonies or during the existence of any of them If other Gentlemen were able to see how one power could be given up merely on abstract reasoning without giving up the rest I can only say that they saw further than I could nor did I ever presume to condemn any one for being clearsighted when I was blind I praise their penetration and learning and hope that their practice has been correspondent to their theory  I had indeed very earnest wishes to keep the whole body of this authority perfect and entire as I found it and to keep it so not for our advantage solely but principally for the sake of those on whose account all just authority exists I mean the people to be governed For I thought I saw that many cases might  well happen in which the exercise of every power comprehended in the broadest idea of legislature might become in its time and circumstances not a little expedient for the peace and union of the Colonies amongst themselves as well as for their perfect harmony with GreatBritain Thinking so perhaps erroneously but being honestly of that opinion I was at the same time very sure that the authority of which I was so jealous could not under the actual circumstances of our Plantations be at all preserved in any of its members but by the greatest reserve in its application particularly in those delicate points in which the feelings of mankind are the most irritable They who thought otherwise have found a few more difficulties in their work than I hope they were thoroughly aware of when they undertook the present business  I must beg leave to observe that it is not only the invidious branch of taxation that will be resisted but that no other given part of legislative rights can be safely exercised without regard to the general opinion of those who are to be governed That general opinion is the vehicle and organ of legislative omnipotence Without this the extent of legislative power may be a theory to entertain the mind but it is nothing in the direction of affairs The compleatness of the legislative  authority of Parliament  over this kingdom  is not questioned and yet there are many things indubitably included in the abstract idea of that power and which carry no absolute injustice in themselves which being contrary to the opinions and feelings of the people can as little be exercised as if Parliament in such cases had been possessed of no right at all I see no abstract reason which can be given why the same power that made and repealed the High Commission Court and the Star Chamber might not revive them again and these courts warned by their former fate might possibly exercise their powers with some degree of justice But the madness would be as unquestionable as the competence of that Parliament which should make such attempts If any thing can be supposed out of the power of human legislature it is Religion I admit however that the established religion of this country has been three or four times altered by act of parliament and therefore that a statute binds even in that case But we may very safely affirm that notwithstanding this apparent omnipotence it would be now found as impossible for King and Parliament to change the established religion of this country as it was to King  James  alone when he attempted to make such an alteration without a Parliament In effect to follow not to force the publick inclination to give a direction a form a technical dress and  a specifick sanction to the general sense of the community is the true end of legislature When it goes beyond this its authority will be precarious let its rights be what they will  It is so with regard to the exercise of all the powers which our constitution knows in any of its parts and indeed to the substantial existence of any of the parts themselves The King's negative to bills is one of the most indisputed of the royal prerogatives and it extends to all cases whatsoever I am far from certain that if several laws which I know had fallen under the stroke of that sceptre that the publick would have had a very heavy loss But it is not the  propriety  of the exercise which is in question The exercise itself is wisely foreborne Its repose may be the preservation of its existence and its existence may be the means of saving the constitution itself on an occasion worthy of bringing it forth  As the disputants whose accurate and logical reasonings have brought us into our present condition think it absurd that powers or members of any constitution should exist rarely if ever to be exercised I hope I shall be excused in mentioning another instance that is material We know that the Convocation of the Clergy had formerly been called  and sat with nearly as much regularity to business as Parliament itself It is now called for form only It sits for the purpose of making some polite ecclesiastical compliments to the King and when that grace is said retires and is heard of no more It is however  a part of the Constitution  and may be called out into act and energy whenever there is occasion and whenever those who conjure up that spirit will choose to abide the consequences It is wise to permit its legal existence it is much wiser to continue it a legal existence only So truly has Prudence constituted as the God of this lower world the entire dominion over every exercise of power committed into its hands and yet I have lived to see prudence and conformity to circumstances wholly set at naught in our late controversies and treated as if they were the most contemptible and irrational of all things I have heard it an hundred times very gravely alledged that in order to keep power in wind it was necessary by preference to exert it in those very points in which it was most likely to be resisted and the least likely to be productive of any advantage  These were the considerations Gentlemen which led me early to think that in the comprehensive dominion which the divine Providence had put into our hands instead of troubling our understandings with speculations  concerning the unity of empire and the identity or distinction of legislative powers and inflaming our passions with the heat and pride of controversy it was our duty in all soberness to conform our Government to the character and circumstances of the several people who compose this mighty and strangely diversified mass I never was wild enough to conceive that one method would serve for the whole I could never conceive that the natives of  Hindostan  and those of  Virginia  could be ordered in the same manner or that the  Cutchery  Court and the grand Jury of  Salem  could be regulated on a similar plan I was persuaded that Government was a practical thing made for the happiness of mankind and not to furnish out a spectacle of uniformity to gratify the schemes of visionary politicians Our business was to rule not to wrangle and it would have been a poor compensation that we had triumphed in a dispute whilst we lost an empire  If there be one fact in the world perfectly clear it is this  "That the disposition of the people of America is wholly averse to any other than a free Government"  and this known character of the people is indication enough to any honest statesman how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their case If any ask me what a free Government is I answer that for any  practical purpose it is what the people think so and that they and not I are the natural lawful and competent judges of this matter If they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is consistent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom I ought to thank them for so great a trust and not to endeavour to prove from thence that they have reasoned amiss and that having gone so far by analogy they must hereafter have no enjoyment but by my pleasure  If we had seen this done by any others we must have concluded them far gone in madness It is melancholy as well as ridiculous to observe the kind of reasoning with which the publick has been amused in order to divert our minds from the common sense of our American policy There are people who have split and anatomised the doctrine of free Government as if it were an abstract question concerning metaphysical liberty and necessity and not a matter of moral prudence and natural feeling They have disputed whether liberty be a positive or a negative idea whether it does not consist in being governed by laws without considering what are the laws or who are the makers they have questioned whether man has any rights by nature and whether all the property he enjoys be not the alms of his government and his life itself their favour and indulgence Others corrupting  religion as these have perverted philosophy contend that Christians are redeemed into captivity and the blood of the Saviour of mankind has been shed to make them the slaves of a few proud and insolent sinners These shocking extremes provoking to extreme of another kind speculations are let loose as destructive to all authority as the former are to all freedom In this manner the stirrers up of this contention not satisfied with distracting our dependencies and filling them with blood and slaughter are corrupting our understandings they are endeavouring to tear up along with practical liberty all the foundations of human society all equity and justice religion and order  Civil freedom gentlemen is not as many have endeavoured to persuade you a thing that lies hid in the depths of abstruse science It is a blessing and a benefit not an abstract speculation and all the just reasoning that can be upon it is of so coarse a texture as perfectly to suit the ordinary capacities of those who are to enjoy and of those who are to defend it Far from any resemblance to those propositions in Geometry and Metaphysics which admit no medium but must be true or false in all their latitude social and civil freedom like all other things in common life are variously mixed and modified enjoyed in very different degrees and shaped  into an infinite diversity of forms according to the temper and circumstances of every community The  extreme  of liberty which is its abstract perfection but its real fault obtains no where nor ought to obtain any where Because extremes as we all know in every point which relates either to our duties or satisfactions in life are destructive both to virtue and enjoyment Liberty too must be limited in order to be possessed The degree of restraint it is impossible in any case to settle precisely But it ought to be the constant aim of every wise publick counsel to find out by cautious experiments and rational cool endeavours with how little not how much of this restraint the community can subsist For liberty is a good to be improved and not an evil to be lessened It is not only a private blessing of the first order but the vital spring and energy of the state itself which has just so much life and vigour as there is liberty in it But whether liberty be advantageous or not for I know it is a fashion to decry the very principle none will dispute that peace is a blessing and peace must in the course of human affairs be frequently bought by some indulgence and toleration at least to liberty For as the Sabbath though of divine institution was made for man not man for the Sabbath government which can claim no higher origin or authority in its exercise at least ought to conform to the exigencies of the time  and the temper and character of the people with whom it is concerned and not always to attempt violently to bend the people to their theories of subjection The bulk of mankind on their part are not excessively curious concerning any theories whilst they are really happy and one sure symptom of an ill conducted state is the propensity of the people to resort to them  But when subjects by a long course of such ill conduct are once thoroughly inflamed and the state itself violently distempered the people must have some satisfaction to their feelings more solid than a sophistical speculation on law and government Such was our situation and such a satisfaction was necessary to prevent recourse to arms it was necessary towards laying them down it will be necessary to prevent the taking them up again and again Of what nature this satisfaction ought to be I wish it had been the disposition of Parliament seriously to consider It was certainly a deliberation that called for the exertion of all their wisdom  I am and ever have been deeply sensible of the difficulty of reconciling the strong presiding power that is so useful towards the conservation of a vast disconnected infinitely diversified empire with that liberty and safety of the provinces which they must enjoy in  opinion and practice at least or they will not be provinces at all I know and have long felt the difficulty of reconciling the unwieldy haughtiness of a great ruling nation habituated to command pampered by enormous wealth and confident from a long course of prosperity and victory to the high spirit of free dependencies animated with the first glow and activity of juvenile heat and assuming to themselves as their birthright some part of that very pride which oppresses them They who perceive no difficulty in reconciling these tempers which however to make peace must some way or other be reconciled are much above my capacity or much below the magnitude of the business Of one thing I am perfectly clear that it is not by deciding the suit but by compromising the difference that peace can be restored or kept They who would put an end to such quarrels by declaring roundly in favour of the whole demands of either party have mistaken in my humble opinion the office of a mediator  The war is now of full two years standing the controversy of many more In different periods of the dispute different methods of reconciliation were to be pursued I mean to trouble you with a short state of things at the most important of these periods in order to give you a more distinct idea of our policy with regard to this most delicate of all objects  The Colonies were from the beginning subject to the legislature of Great Britain on principles which they never examined and we permitted to them many local privileges without asking how they agreed with that legislative authority Modes of administration were formed in an insensible and very unsystematick manner But they gradually adapted themselves to the varying condition of thingsWhat was first a single kingdom stretched into an empire and an imperial superintendency of some kind or other became necessary Parliament from a mere representative of the people and a guardian of popular privileges for its own immediate constituents grew into a mighty sovereign Instead of being a control on the Crown on its own behalf it communicated a sort of strength to the Royal authority which was wanted for the conservation of a new object but which could not be safely trusted to the Crown alone On the other hand the Colonies advancing by equal steps and governed by the same necessity had formed within themselves either by royal instruction or royal charter assemblies so exceedingly resembling a parliament in all their forms functions and powers that it was impossible they should not imbibe some opinion of a similar authority  At the first designation of these assemblies they were probably not intended for any thing  more nor perhaps did they think themselves much higher than the municipal corporations within this Island to which some at present love to compare them But nothing in progression can rest on its original plan We may as well think of rocking a grown man in the cradle of an infant Therefore as the Colonies prospered and encreased to a numerous and mighty people spreading over a very great tract of the globe it was natural that they should attribute to assemblies so respectable in their formal constitution some part of the dignity of the great nations which they represented No longer tied to byelaws these assemblies made acts of all sorts and in all cases whatsoever They levied money not for parochial purposes but upon regular grants to the Crown following all the rules and principles of a Parliament to which they approached every day more and more nearly Those who think themselves wiser than Providence and stronger than the course of nature may complain of all this variation on the one side or the other as their several humours and prejudices may lead them But things could not be otherwise and English Colonies must be had on these terms or not had at all In the mean time neither party felt any inconvenience from this double legislature to which they had been formed by imperceptible habits and old custom the great support of all the governments in the world Though these two legislatures  were sometimes found perhaps performing the very same functions they did not very grossly or systematically clash In all likelyhood this arose from mere neglect possibly from the natural operation of things which left to themselves generally fall into their proper order But whatever was the cause it is certain that a regular revenue by the authority of Parliament for the support of civil and military establishments seems not to have been thought of until the Colonies were too proud to submit too strong to be forced too enlightened not to see all the consequences which must arise from such a system  If ever this scheme of taxation was to be pushed against the inclinations of the people it was evident that discussions must arise which would let loose all the elements that composed this double constitution would shew how much each of their members had departed from its original principles and would discover contradictions in each legislature as well to its own first principles as to its relation to the other very difficult if not absolutely impossible to be reconciled  Therefore at the first fatal opening of this contest the wisest course seemed to be to put an end as soon as possible to the immediate causes of the dispute and to quiet a discussion not easily settled upon clear principles and  arising from claims which pride would permit neither party to abandon by resorting as nearly as possible to the old successful course A mere repeal of the obnoxious tax with a declaration of the legislative authority of this kingdom was then fully sufficient to procure peace to  both sides  Man is a creature of habit and the first breach being of very short continuance the Colonies fell back exactly into their antient state The Congress has used an expression with regard to this pacification which appears to me truly significant After the repeal of the Stamp Act  "the Colonies fell"  says this assembly  "into their antient state of  unsuspecting confidence in the Mother Country  "  This unsuspecting confidence is the true center of gravity amongst mankind about which all the parts are at rest It is this  unsuspecting confidence  that removes all difficulties and reconciles all the contradictions which occur in the complexity of all antient puzzled political establishments Happy are the rulers which have the secret of preserving it  The whole empire has reason to remember with eternal gratitude the wisdom and temper of that man and his excellent associates who to recover this confidence formed the plan of pacification in That plan being built upon the nature of man and the circumstances and habits of the two countries and not on any visionary speculations perfectly answered  its end as long as it was thought proper to adhere to it Without giving a rude shock to the dignity well or ill understood of this Parliament it gave perfect content to our dependencies Had it not been for the mediatorial spirit and talents of that great man between such clashing pretensions and passions we should then have rushed headlong I know what I say into the calamities of that civil war in which by departing from his system we are at length involved and we should have been precipitated into that war at a time when circumstances both at home and abroad were far very far more unfavourable unto us than they were at the breaking out of the present troubles  I had the happiness of giving my first votes in Parliament for that pacification I was one of those almost unanimous members who in the necessary concessions of Parliament would as much as possible have preserved its authority and respected its honour I could not at once tear from my heart prejudices which were dear to me and which bore a resemblance to virtues I had then and I have still my partialities What Parliament gave up I wished to be given as of grace and favour and affection and not as a restitution of stolen goods High dignity relented as it was soothed and an act of benignity from old acknowledged greatness had its full effect on our dependencies Our unlimited declaration of legislative  authority produced not a single murmur If this undefined power has become odious since that time and full of horror to the Colonies it is because the  unsuspicious confidence  is lost and the parental affection in the bosom of whose boundless authority they reposed their privileges is become estranged and hostile  It will be asked if such was then my opinion of the mode of pacification how I came to be the very person who moved not only for a repeal of all the late coercive statutes but for mutilating by a positive law the entireness of the legislative power of Parliament and cutting off from it the whole right of taxation I answer because a different state of things requires a different conduct When the dispute had gone to the last extremities which no man laboured more to prevent than I did the concessions which had satisfied in the beginning could satisfy no longer the violation of tacit faith required explicit security The same cause which has introduced all formal compacts and covenants among men made it necessary I mean habits of soreness jealousy and distrust I parted with it as with a limb but as with a limb to save the body and I would have parted with more if more had been necessary Any thing rather than a fruitless hopeless unnatural civil war This mode of yielding would it is said give way to independency without a war I am persuaded  from the nature of things and from every information that it would have had a directly contrary effect But if it had this effect I confess that I should prefer independency without war to independency with it and I have so much trust in the inclinations and prejudices of mankind and so little in any thing else that I should expect ten times more benefit to this Kingdom from the affection of America though under a separate establishment than from her perfect submission to the Crown and Parliament accompanied with her terror disgust and abhorrence Bodies tied together by so unnatural a bond of union as mutual hatred are only connected to their ruin  One hundred and ten respectable Members of Parliament voted for that concession Many not present when the motion was made were of the sentiments of those who voted I knew it would then have made peace I am not without hopes that it would do so at present if it were adopted No benefit no revenue could be lost by it For be fully assured that of all the phantoms that ever deluded the fond hopes of a credulous world a parliamentary revenue in the Colonies is the most perfectly chimerical Your breaking them to any subjection far from relieving your burthens the pretext for this war will never pay that military force which will be kept up to the destruction  of their liberties and yours I risque nothing in this prophecy  Gentlemen you have my opinion on the present state of public affairs Mean as these opinions may be in themselves your partiality has made them of some importance Without troubling myself to enquire whether I am under a formal obligation to it I have a pleasure in accounting for my conduct to my Constituents I feel warmly on this subject and I express myself as I feel If I presume to blame any public proceeding I cannot be supposed to be personal Would to God I could be suspected of it My fault might be greater but the public calamity would be less extensive If my conduct has not been able to make any impression on the warm part of that antient and powerful party with whose support I was not honoured at my Election on my side my respect regard and duty to them is not at all lessened I owe the Gentlemen who compose it my most humble service in every thing I hope that whenever any of them were pleased to command me that they found me perfectly equal in my obedience But flattery and friendship are very different things and to mislead is not to serve them I cannot purchase the favour of any man by concealing from him what I think his ruin  By the favour of my fellowcitizens I am the representative of an honest wellordered virtuous City of a people who preserve more of the original English simplicity and purity of manners than perhaps any other You possess among you several men and magistrates of large and cultivated understandings fit for any employment in any sphere I do to the best of my power act so as to make myself worthy of so honourable a choice If I were ready on any call of my own vanity or interest or to answer any election purpose to forsake principles whatever they are which I had formed at a mature age on full reflexion and which have been confirmed by long experience I should forfeit the only thing which makes you pardon so many errors and imperfections in me  Not that I think it fit for any one to rely too much on his own understanding or to be filled with a presumption not becoming a Christian man in his own personal stability and rectitude I hope I am far from that vain confidence which almost always fails in trial I know my weakness in all respects as much at least as any enemy I have and I attempt to take security against it The only method which has ever been found effectual to preserve any man against the corruption of nature and example is an habit of life and communication of councils with the most virtuous and  public spirited men of the age you live in Such a society cannot be kept without advantage or deserted without shame For this rule of conduct I may be called in reproach a  party man  but I am little affected with such aspersions In the way which they call party I worship the constitution of your fathers and I shall never blush for my political company All reverence to honour all idea of what it is will be lost out of the world before it can be imputed as a fault to any man that he has been closely connected with those incomparable persons living and dead with whom for eleven years I have constantly thought and acted If I have wandered out of the paths of rectitude into those of interested faction it was in company with the Saviles the Dowdeswells the Wentworths the Bentincks with the Lenoxes the Manchesters the Keppels the Saunders's with the temperate permanent hereditary virtue of the whole house of Cavendish names among which some have extended your fame and empire in arms and all have fought the battle of your liberties in fields not less gloriousThese and many more like these grafting public principles on private honour have redeemed the present age and would have adorned the most splendid period in your history Where could a man conscious of his inability to act alone and willing to act as he ought to do have arranged himself better If any one thinks this kind of society to be taken up as  the best method of gratifying low personal pride or ambitious interest he is mistaken and knows nothing of the world  Preferring this connexion I do not mean to detract in the slightest degree from others There are some of those whom I admire at something of a greater distance with whom I have had the happiness also perfectly to agree in almost all the particulars in which I have differed with some successive administrations and they are such as it never can be reputable to any government to reckon among its enemies  I hope there are none of you corrupted with the doctrine taught by wicked men for the worst purposes and greedily received by the malignant credulity of envy and ignorance which is that the men who act upon the public stage are all alike all equally corrupt all influenced by no other views than the sordid lucre of salary and pension The thing I know by experience to be false Never expecting to find perfection in men and not looking for divine attributes in created beings in my commerce with my cotemporaries I have found much human virtue I have seen not a little public spirit a real subordination of interest to duty and a decent and regulated sensibility to honest fame and reputation The age unquestionably  produces whether in a greater or less number than in former times I know not daring profligates and insidious hypocrites What then Am I not to avail myself of whatever good is to be found in the world because of the mixture of evil that will always be in it The smallness of the quantity in currency only heightens the value They who raise suspicions on the good on account or the behaviour of ill men are of the party of the latter The common cant is no justification for taking this party I have been deceived say they by  Titius  and  Moevius  I have been the dupe of this pretender or of that mountebank and I can trust appearances no longer But my credulity and want of discernment cannot as I conceive amount to a fair presumption against any man's integrity A conscientious person would rather doubt his own judgment than condemn his species He would say I have observed without attention or judged upon erroneous maxims I trusted to profession when I ought to have attended to conduct Such a man will grow wise not malignant by his acquaintance with the world But he that accuses all mankind of corruption ought to remember that he is sure to convict only one In truth I should much rather admit those whom at any time I have disrelished the most to be patterns of perfection than seek a consolation to my own unworthiness in a general communion of depravity with all about me  That this illnatured doctrine should be preached by the missionaries of a court I do not wonder It answers their purpose But that it should be heard among those who pretend to be strong assertors of liberty is not only surprising but hardly natural This moral levelling is a  servile principle  It leads to practical passive obedience far better than all the doctrines which the pliant accommodation of Theology to power has ever produced It cuts up by the roots not only all idea of forcible resistance but even of civil opposition It disposes men to an abject submission not by opinion which may be shaken by argument or altered by passion but by the strong ties of public and private interest For if all men who act in a public situation are equally selfish corrupt and venal what reason can be given for desiring any sort of change which besides the evils which must attend all changes can be productive of no possible advantage The active men in the state are true samples of the mass If they are universally depraved the commonwealth itself is not found We may amuse ourselves with talking as much as we please of the virtue of middle or humble life that is we may place our confidence in the virtue of those who have never been tried But if the persons who are continually emerging out of that sphere be no better than those whom  birth has placed above it what hopes are there in the remainder of the body which is to furnish the perpetual succession of the state All who have ever written on government are unanimous that among a people generally corrupt liberty cannot long exist And indeed how is it possible when those who are to make the laws to guards to enforce or to obey them are by a tacit confederacy of manners indisposed to the spirit of all generous and noble institutions  I am aware that the age is not what we all wish But I am sure that the only means of checking its precipitate degeneracy is heartily to concur with whatever is the best in our time and to have some more correct standard of judging what that best is than the transient and uncertain favour of a court If once we are able to find and can prevail on ourselves to strengthen an union of such men whatever accidentally becomes indisposed to illexercised power even by the ordinary operation of human passions must join with that society and cannot long be joined without in some degree assimilating to it Virtue will catch as well as vice by contact and the public stock of honest manly principle will daily accumulate We are not too nicely to scrutinize motives as long as action is irreproachable It is enough and for a worthy man perhaps too much to  deal out its infamy to convicted guilt and declared apostacy  To act on the principles of the constitution with the best men the time affords has been from the beginning the rule of my conduct and I mean to continue it as long as such a body as I have described can by any possibility be kept together For I should think it the most dreadful of all offences not only towards the present generation but to all the future if I were to do any thing which could make the minutest breach in this great conservatory of free principles Those who perhaps have the same intentions but are separated by some little political animosities will I hope discern at last how little conducive it is to any rational purpose to lower its reputation For my part Gentlemen from much experience from no little thinking and from comparing a great variety of things I am thoroughly persuaded that the last hopes of preserving the spirit of the English Constitution or of reuniting the dissipated members of the English race upon a common plan of tranquillity and liberty does entirely depend on the firm and lasting union of such men and above all on their keeping themselves from that despair which is so very apt to fall on those whom a violence of character and a mixture of ambitious views do not support through a long painful and unsuccessful struggle  There never Gentlemen was a period in which the stedfastness of some men has been put to so sore a trial It is not very difficult for wellformed minds to abandon their interest but the separation of fame and virtue is an harsh divorce Liberty is in danger of being made unpopular to Englishmen Contending for an imaginary power we begin to acquire the spirit of domination and to lose the relish of honest equality The principles of our forefathers become suspected to us because we see them animating the present opposition of our children The faults which grow out of the luxuriance of freedom appear much more shocking to us than the base vices which are generated from the rankness of servitude Accordingly the least resistance to power appears more inexcuseable in our eyes than the greatest abuses of authority All dread of a standing military force is looked upon as a superstitious panick All shame of calling in foreigners and savages in a civil contest is worn off We grow indifferent to the consequences inevitable to ourselves from the plan of ruling half the empire by a mercenary sword We are taught to believe that a desire of domineering over our countrymen is love to our country that those who hate civil war abet rebellion and that the amiable and conciliatory virtues of lenity moderation and tenderness to the privileges of those who depend  on this kingdom are a sort of treason to the state  It is impossible that we should remain long in a situation which breeds such notions and dispositions without some great alreration in the national character Those ingenuous and feeling minds who are so fortified against all other things and so unarmed to whatever approaches in the shape of disgrace finding the principles which they considered as sure means of honour to be grown into disrepute will retire disheartened and disgusted Those of a more robust make the bold able ambitious men who pay some part of their court to power through the people and substitute the voice of transient opinion in the place of true glory will give into the general mode The superior understandings which ought to correct vulgar prejudice will confirm and aggravate its errors Many things have been long operating towards a gradual change in our principles But this American war has done more in a very few years than all the other causes could have effected in a century It is therefore not on its own separate account but because of its attendant circumstances that I consider its continuance or its ending in any way but that of an honourable and liberal accommodation as the greatest evils which can befal us For that reason I have troubled you with this long letter For that reason I intreat you again and again neither  to be perswaded shamed or frighted out of the principles that have hitherto led so many of you to abhor the war its cause and its consequences Let us not be amongst the first who renounce the maxims of our forefathers  I have the honour to be GENTLEMEN Your most obedient and faithful humble Servant EDMUND BURKE  BEACONSFIELD  April    PS  You may communicate this Letter in any manner you think proper to my Constituents  FINIS
