 OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE of the HIGHWAYS AND On the LAWS for Amending and Keeping them in REPAIR  WITH A DRAUGHT of a BILL for comprehending and reducing into one Act of Parliament the most essential Parts of all the Statutes in Force relating to the Highways and for making Provision for the more easy and effectual Repair of the Highways  By JOHN HAWKINS  Esq  One of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of  Middlesex  LONDON Printed by his Majesty's LawPrinter for J WORRALL at the  Dove  in  BellYard  near  TempleBar  Sold also By Mess DODSLEY in  PallMall  B

Custos Rotulorum  of the County of  Middlesex  MY LORD  THE Reflections contained in the following Pages are the Result of an Enquiry to which my Duty led me wherein the Necessity  of an Alteration is suggested in a Branch of the StatuteLaws of great Importance to the internal Interests of this Nation and a Proposal for an Amendment of those Laws is humbly submitted to that Authority in which alone the Power of enacting and repealing Statutes resides  It is not in Behalf of a Book but as the Advocate of the industrious Poor the Sinews the Muscles of the Body politic and as the Friend of Agriculture and Manufactures the most innocent and laudable Means of national Greatness that I presume to address your Lordship  The Relation which your Lordship by an Office of great Trust and Honour bears to a County that without  any invidious Comparison is second to none in the Kingdom for Wealth and Grandeur and which is honoured by the Residence of his Majesty and the Royal Family had afforded a plausible Excuse for this Trouble but the Consideration of that Benevolence and Zeal for the Interests of your Country which you have exerted in many Instances too recent to be forgotten left no Room to doubt but that any Attempt for its Service would be favourably received  Permit me therefore my Lord so far only as it shall seem likely to produce any Benefit to the Public to intreat your Lordship's Protection for the following Proposal as I am firmly persuaded that if it meets with Approbation  your Lordship's Wisdom and Humanity will suggest the Means of rendering that Benefit as extensive and effectual as possible I am with great Respect  Your Lordship's devoted Humble Servant JOHN HAWKINS  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Bill to which the following Observations are an Introduction consists  First  Of those Clauses in the several Acts of Parliament now in Force which have been found most useful with some few Variations  Secondly  Of such new Clauses as seemed necessary for answering the Ends now proposed These latter are printed in a different Character from the Rest of the Bill and are recommended to the Consideration in the approaching Recess of Parliament of those Members of either House who whether in Business or Retirement are equally solicitous to promote the public Good and who knowing that the Meaning and Operation of legal Language is one of the most evanescent Subjects that the human Mind is conversant with will employ their Talents in detecting any of those informal Expressions which often defeat the Purposes of the best intended Laws  The general Form of the  BILL  was suggested by a casual View of an anonymous Pamphlet published almost Thirty Years ago under the Title of  "A Scheme for reducing all the Laws relating to the common Highways into one Act of Parliament"  and said in the Preface to have been written by a Gentleman in the Commission of the Peace who had made the Amendment of the Highways his principal Care for many Years But this Scheme consisting merely of a Draught of a Bill for that Purpose not very artificial in its Construction very little Assistance could be derived from it more than regarded the Selection and Arrangement of the Clauses in former Statutes proper to be retained in any future Law and as not only the Method of imposing and apportioning the StatuteDuty now recommended is widely different from that Author's but every Section contained in his Scheme has been both formally and substantially varied and the Preamble and almost every one of the additional Clauses new drawn the Author of the present Publication fears he has made himself answerable for whatever may be found amiss in the Bill as it now stands  Perhaps in estimating the Price of a Day's Labour at one Shilling and Sixpence he has exceeded the usual Rate if this should be the Case let it be remembred that he had an Eye to the  Counties adjacent to the Metropolis and that any other Estimation tho' it may occasion some small Alteration in the Penalties will not affect the general Reasoning contained in the Proposal  If it should be thought eligible notwithstanding the Reasons within given to the contrary to annihilate the StatuteDuty the Bill may be easily adapted to that End But this the Public may be assured of that every Attempt to amend the HighwayLaws by additional or explanatory Acts will produce great Confusion among those whose Duty it is to execute them and that nothing can remedy the Evils at present complained of but the Consolidation into one Act of the most efficacious Clauses contained in those now subsisting  March  ERRATA  Page Line from the Bottom read performing  such Services  such Person  c  Page Line for  complete  read  competent  Page Line for  s  read  s  OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE of the HIGHWAYS  c  THE Attention of the Public notwithstanding it has been engaged by an Object of the utmost Importance has of late Years been employed to a very extraordinary Degree in the Repair and Improvement of the Public Roads in this and the neighbouring Kingdom Persons of all Ranks and Professions the Philosopher and the Mechanic have with a laudable Emulation contended who should most promote the Interest of this Country by facilitating the Methods of conveying its Produce from one End to the other  Nor is this to be looked upon as any other than a particular Mode of that Benevolence  which if we do not greatly flatter ourselves is at present the distinguishing Characteristic of the Inhabitants of this Island a Principle which we have beheld operating in various Ways and which even now seeks and solicits Occasion for its Exertion  A Disposition more favourable to any Proposal calculated either to remove a public Grievance or produce any positive Good is not to be wished for and it is hoped that that contained in the following Pages may be thought to have a Tendency to promote one or other of those Ends  It is too obvious to need insisting on that very little of the Concern which has of late been shewn about the Roads in general has been directed to those which lead from Parish to Parish and are not the ordinary Channel of Conveyance to Cities and Towns of great Trade The Invention of Turnpikes is manifestly calculated for great Roads which as they are made in Favour of Commerce produce a Revenue sufficient to keep them in Repair but the former have been left to the Care of the Surveyors of the Highways in their respective Parishes subject to the Direction and Controul of the Justices of Peace whose Authority in this Branch of their Jurisdiction is of such a Nature that it carries the Appearance of great Oppression and  can seldom be exerted to any beneficial Purpose  In what Manner and by whom the Highways were anciently repaired does not at this Time clearly appear it is probable that while the Feudal Law subsisted in its greatest Vigour and the Number of Vassals was greater than it has been at any Time since the Introduction of Manufactures and Commerce amongst us that the baser Tenures particularly that of Villenage might oblige the inferior Class of People to this Duty and this Opinion seems to be warranted by a Passage of an Author of very respectable Authority whereby it appears that the Judges had in Charge to enquire among other Things  "of common Highways destroyed or otherwise in bad Repair who is bound to repair and amend them and such as are presented shall be attached by personal Distress to appear and if it be found on their Appearance in Court that they hold certain Tenements of the King upon Condition that they repair such Way the said Tenements are to be seised into the King's Hands and the Sheriffs are to answer for the Issues and to cause the Repairs to be done and where there is no Tenement held of the King by the Performing such Persons as are bound to repair the Ways and have not discharged their Duty are to be in the King's Mercy and the Sheriff  is to be commanded that he cause them to be distrained by their Cattle and by their Chattels and to detain the Distresses until they have amended the Defects"  Britton cap    De plusors Tortz  The Statute of  Winton    Edw  I seems to have been made but in Affirmance of this Law for thereby the Lord is  "to abate certain Nusances in the Highways leading from one MarketTown to another or be fined at the King's Pleasure he is also to fell the Underwoods in such Highways and for that Purpose is to have the Aid of the Country  But the earliest Statute of which the Law now seems to take Notice is that of      Phil Mar cap  which after creating an Office till then unknown to our Constitution that of Surveyors of the Highways proceeds to direct the Manner of their Election and Choice in Terms which import  "That the Constable and Churchwardens of every Parish shall yearly upon  Tuesday  or  Wednesday  in  Easter  Week call together a Number of the Parishioners and shall elect two of the Parish to be Surveyors for one Year of the Works for amending of the Highways leading to any MarketTown which Persons shall have Authority to order and direct the  Persons and Carriages that shall be appointed for the amending the Highways by their Directions and shall take upon them the said Offices upon Pain to forfeit  s  "  The Statute then proceeds to enact  Sect    "That the Constable and Churchwardens shall then also appoint four Days for amending the Highways before the Feast of St  John Baptist  and shall openly in the Church the next  Sunday  after  Easter  give Knowledge of the same four Days and upon the said Days the Parishioners shall endeavour themselves to the Amending of the Highways and shall be chargeable thereto as followeth  viz  Every Person for every Ploughland in Tillage or Pasture that he or she shall occupy in the Parish and every other Person keeping there a Draught or Plough shall send at every Day and Place appointed one Wain or Cart furnished after the Custom of the Country with Oxen Horses or other Cattle and all other Necessaries to carry Things convenient and also two able Men with the same upon Pain of every Draught making Default  s  And every other Housholder Cottager and Labourer able to labour and being no hired Servant by the Year shall by themselves or one sufficient Labourer upon every of the said four Days work in the Amendment of the Highways upon Pain to lose  for every Day  d  and all the said Persons and Carriages shall do their Works as they shall be appointed by the Supervisors eight Hours of every of the said Days unless they be otherwise licensed by them And the Stewards of every Leet shall have Power to enquire by the Oaths of the Suitors of all Offences against this Statute and to asssess Fines and Amerciaments as shall be thought meet by the Steward and in Default of such Enquiry or Presentment the Justices of Peace shall have Authority to enquire of the same Offences at their QuarterSessions and to assess Fines as they or any two of them whereof one to be of the  Quorum  shall think meet and the Steward of every Leet shall make estreats indented of the Fines and Amerciaments for the Defaults presented before him and shall deliver one Part thereof sealed and signed by him to the Bailiff or High Constable of every Hundred and the other Part to the Constable and Churchwardens of the Parish wherein the Defaults were made the same to be yearly delivered within Six Weeks after the Feast of St  Michael  and the Clerk of the Peace shall make like Estreats of the Fines and Amerciaments for the Defaults presented before the Justices of the Peace and deliver the same as aforesaid which Estreats shall be sufficient Warrant to the Bailiff or  chief Constable to levy the Amerciaments and Fines by Distress and if no sufficient Distress can be found or the Offender shall refuse to pay the Amerciament or Fine and do not pay the same within twenty Days after Demand such Person to forfeit double the Sum that he should have paid"  The Statute above cited was to continue in Force for Seven Years but being suffered to expire it was revived by  Eliz cap  and by  Eliz cap  it was made perpetual  There is great reason to think that these Provisions of the Law fell very far short of producing the Ends proposed by them since we find that the Repair of Bridges Causways and Highways even after the Time of  Phil Mar  was deemed a laudable Exertion of public Spirit  Sutton  the Founder of the  CharterHouse  bequeathed by his Will great Sums for Purposes of this Sort The Testaments of wealthy People who died before the Reign of  Charles  the Second afford many other Examples of the like Nature and many Corporations are Feoffees of Lands charged with the perpetual Repair of public Roads in different Parts of the Kingdom  It is remarkable that the Beneficence of this Nation has at successive Periods been directed  to very different Objects The Building of Churches and the Endowment of Monasteries were the first Instances of public Charity of which we have any Memorials The Dissolution of Religious Houses and the Reformation which immediately followed furnished Motives to the Erection of Seminaries for Learning To this succeeded the Foundation and Endowment of AlmsHouses after that the Building of Charity Schools and last of all Hospitals so that for this Reason and perhaps because the Law has taken them under its Care we now seldom hear of any private Donations for repairing the Highways  We see that by the Statute of  Phil Mar  the Persons bound to contribute either by Labour or in Money to the Amendment of the Highways are divided into two Classes the first whereof consists of  Such as occupy a Ploughland in Tillage or Pasture within the Parish and  Every other Person keeping there a Draught or Plough  These are to send at every Day and Place appointed one Wain or Cart with Oxen Horses or other Cattle and two Men on Pain of every Draught making Default  s  The second Class consists of  Every Housholder Cottager and Labourer able to labour and being no hired Servant by the year who are required by themselves or one sufficient Labourer for every of them on every of the said Days to work in the Amendment of the Highways upon Pain to lose for every Day  d  Thus we may observe every Individual in the Kingdom from the yearly hired Servant upwards is required to contribute to this necessary Work and that those LandHolders who by occupying less than a Ploughland and keeping no Draught or Plough are not comprehended within the first descriptive Clause are yet reached by the second and we may very reasonably infer that had there been at the Time of making the Statute as there is now any Rank of Men equally capable in respect of their Wealth of contributing to the Amendment of the Highways with those described by the first Clause and yet not included in it that in that Case the Legislature would by a few Words have extended that Clause to them and not tacitly have ranked such Persons with Housholders Cottagers and Labourers able to labour  It is true that even at the Time of making this Statute it was not universally agreed what Quantity of Land a Ploughland contained and that the Antiquaries and Lawyers entertained different Opinions about that Matter My Lord  Coke  has said that a Carve or Hide of Land or a Ploughland which is all one is not of any certain Content but so much as one Plough may plough in one Year and so in some Countries it is more and in others less according to the Heaviness of the Soil  Coke's Rep    Lowe's Case  Others assert a Difference between a Hide and a Carve or Ploughland for they say that a Hide of Land contains four Ploughlands or Acres whereas a Carve or Ploughland contains but Acres or four Yardlands of thirty Acres each others again maintain a Carve or Ploughland to be an indefinite Measure  quantum aratrum arare potest in oestivo tempore  Vide  Skene Minsheu  and  Norden's Surveiour's Dialogue  However this Controversy is now at an End the Statute of  Will    cap  having settled that  l  a Year shall be deemed a Ploughland  Thus stood the Law till the Time of Queen  Eliz  in the th th and th of whose Reign three several Statutes were made for the Repair of Highways By that of the th  cap    sect  the Surveyors are required  "within one Month next after Default made contrary to the Statute of      Phil Mar  or this Act to present such Default to the next Justice of the Peace upon Pain to forfeit  s  and such Justice shall certify the same Presentment at the next General Sessions upon Pain to forfeit  l  and the Justices of the Peace shall have Authority to enquire of any such Default or Offence at their QuarterSessions and to assess such Fines for the same as they or any two of them whereof one to be of the  Quorum  shall think meet"  The principal End of the Statutes of      Eliz  was the Clearing up certain Doubts that had arisen upon the Construction of the former Statute to invest the Surveyors with more extensive Powers particularly as to providing Materials and to increase the Number of Days Labour from four to six Indeed one of these Statutes  viz  that of the th of the Queen  sect  enacts that every Person except such as dwell in  London  that shall be assessed to any Subsidy to  l  in Goods or  s  in Land or above being none of the Parties chargeable for the Amendment of the Highways by any former Law but as a Cottager shall find two able Men yearly to labour in the Highways at such Times as by the said Statute are appointed But how far this Law can be said to be in Force now the  Method of raising Money by Subsidy is discontinued is Matter of Question  But afterwards upon Consideration it was found that in many Places of the Kingdom there was no Use for Carts and Teams but that the Practice was to carry Materials on Horses Backs or by other Kinds of Carriage it is therefore by  Car    cap    sect  enacted  That in such Places the Inhabitants shall send in such their Horses as are accustomed to that Labour and their other Carriages as by any former Statute is appointed for Carts  Sect    "If any Person shall fail to make their Days Labour for repairing the Highways or neglect to send their Carriages it shall be lawful for the Surveyors to make Complaint to the next Justices of the Peace who are required upon Proof by Oath of one Witness to levy by Distress and Sale of the Goods of every Person failing as aforesaid and not having a reasonable Excuse to be allowed by the Justices the Penalties hereafter mentioned  viz  for every Day Labourer  s    d  for every Man and Horse  s  and for every Cart with two Men  s  for every Day which Penalties shall be employed for repairing the Highways"  Also by  Sect  of this Statute it is  "provided that where the Highways cannot be sufficiently repaired before the Feast of St  John Baptist  yearly the same may be repaired before the Feast of St  Luke  without incurring any Penalty"  And by  Sect    "the Surveyors shall be yearly chosen by such Persons as by an Act of      Phil Mar cap  is appointed upon some Day in the Week that  Christmas  Day shall be which Persons so chosen shall take upon them the Office and shall appoint six Days for the providing Materials and for working in the Highways giving Notice publickly before the Days and the Surveyors shall make Return of the Defaulters within one Month to some neighbouring Justice of the Peace who shall present the same at the QuarterSessions next after such Return and the Offenders against this Act in all Cases not particularly directed shall incur the Penalties inflicted by the Laws now in Force for amending of Highways"  It is observable that the Word Teams is not made use of in any of the Statutes previous to this of  Car  and that that Appellation instead of fixing the Meaning of the Law has unfortunately rendered it more vague and uncertain for admitting after what has been said  a Possibility that a Coach Chariot or PostChaise and two Horses might be deemed a Draught yet that they should ever be reckoned a Team no one can imagine  We may reasonably enough suppose that the former Statutes had been found defective in Respect to the Qualifications and Directions therein contained for the Election of the Surveyors For  By  Stat        Will Mar cap    sect    "Upon the th of  December  in every Year unless that Day be  Sunday  and then on the th the Constables Headboroughs TythingMen Churchwardens Surveyors of the Highways and Inhabitants in every Parish shall assemble and make a List of the Names of a competent Number of Inhabitants who have Hereditaments in their own Right or that of their Wives of the Value of  l  by the Year or a Personal Estate of the Value of  l  or are Occupiers of Tenements of the yearly Value of  l  or if there shall be no such Persons in the Parish then the List to be of the most sufficient Inhabitants and shall return such List unto two Justices of the Peace in or near the Division at a special Session to be held within the said Division on the d of  January  or within fifteen Days after And the Justices shall then out of  the said Lists by Warrant appoint one two or more Surveyors of the Highways of every Parish within the Division for the Year ensuing which Appointment shall by the Constables  c  be notified to the Persons appointed within six Days after such Nomination by serving them with the Warrants or leaving the same or a Copy thereof at their Houses and the Persons so appointed shall be Surveyors of the Highways for the Parish for the Year ensuing and duly execute the Office and if the Persons so nominated and served shall neglect or refuse so to do they shall forfeit  l  to be levied on their Goods by Distress and Sale and in Case of such Neglect or Refusal Justices are empowered to appoint other Persons"  And by  Sect  of the same Statute  "upon Notice given by the Surveyors to the Justices at their special Sessions and Oath made of what Money they have laid out upon amending the Highways the Justices or any two of them are empowered by Warrant to cause an equal Rate to be made for reimbursing the Surveyors upon all the Inhabitants of such Parish according to the Methods prescribed in an Act of  Eliz cap  for Relief of the Poor which Rate being confirmed by the Justices in their Special Sessions shall be collected by the Surveyors"  But by  Sect  such Assessment is not in one Year to exceed  d  in the Pound for Lands nor  d  in  l  for Personal Estate  It has already been mentioned that there had been a Variety of Opinions as to the Quantity of Land of which a Ploughland was supposed to consist it was therefore by the  Stat  of  Will    cap    sect  declared that any Person that should have in his Occupation  WoodLand  or  other Land  to the Value of  l per Annum  should be deemed to have a Ploughland within the Statutes of Highways notwithstanding which the Practice is to charge the MarketGardeners about  London  who are very numerous only to the lesser Statute Duty though the Quantity of Ground that most of them occupy might justly subject them to the greater  By the  Geo stat    cap    sect  All Surveyors of the Highways are required  ex Officio  "every four Months or oftener if required by Warrant to give a true Account in Wriing upon Oath of the Condition of the Highways and of such Defects as want to be repaired and of the Neglects of Labourers and those who are obliged to find Labourers or Teams to the Justices at their next Special Session And all Surveyors neglecting to give such Account shall suffer the same Penalty as  if they had refused to execute the Office"  And that by the Statute of  Will Mar cap    sect  is  l  By  Sect  of the same Act the Power of the Justices to make an Assessment is extended to the Case of Highways which are so far out of Order that they cannot be repaired as they ought without further Power than the Laws had then directed and the Justices may cause Assessments not exceeding the Proportions limited by the Act of      Will Mar cap  and the Money to be disposed of as by the said Act is directed though the six Days Work have not been performed the raising Money by Assessment not to excuse the Work of any Teams or Labourers  And here it may be proper to take Notice what the Sense of the Law appears to have been in the Construction of the Statutes abovecited and first it seems  That a Highway may be either a FootWay a Foot and HorseWay which is also a DriftWay or a Foot Horse and CartWay  Co Litt    That a Ploughland or a Carve or Hide of Land may contain House Meadow Pasture  and Wood  Coke's Rep    b    Coke's Rep    That Persons in Holy Orders are within the Purview of these Statutes in Respect of their Spiritual Possessions  Hawk P C    That notwithstanding the Words of the Statute of  Phil Mar  extend only to the Occupiers of Lands yet if the Owner neither occupy nor let them but suffer them to lie fresh he shall be charged  Ibid  That he who keeps several Draughts in a Parish is bound to send a Team for each Draught whether he occupy any Land in the Parish or not  Ibid  Upon a very transient Retrospect to the Laws above cited we shall see that the Legislature seem to have thought it just that the Burthen of repairing the Highways should be borne by the several Classes of People into which it had arranged them in Proportion to their respective Circumstances and the Use they might each of them be supposed to make of the Highways And inasmuch as these Laws are not in the Number of those which as some fanciful Legists have asserted execute themselves it was necessary to appoint proper Officers whose Duty should be in general to take Care of the Highways  and see that the several Laws enacted for their Preservation and Amendment from Time to Time were complied with And with regard to the Manner in which these Laws are executed we also find that in pursuance of the Authority given them by the Statutes abovementioned particularly that of      Will Mar  the respective Parish Officers and Inhabitants of every Parish throughout the Kingdom do yearly at the stated Time for that Purpose make Returns of a complete Number of Inhabitants qualified as the Act directs to the Justices in their Sessions who thereout do by their Warrant appoint the Surveyors of every Parish within their respective DivisionsThat the Money remaining in the Hands of their Predecessors is paid over to the new SurveyorsThat some Time in the Summer a general Notice is published in the Parish Church of the Six Days on which the Inhabitants are required to work on the HighwaysThat on those Days some attend and others make DefaultThat about St  Luke  's Day in every Year a Return is made of the Defaulters to the Justices who if no Cause is assigned on a Summons issued by them for that Purpose execute Distress Warrants upon which the respective Penalties are levied which it is supposed are applied in hiring Persons to do that Labour which the Law in the first Instance imposes on the Defaulters themselves  Before we proceed to point out the various Ways by which the salutary Purposes of the Legislature may be and are defeated it will be necessary to enquire how far the Laws now under Consideration do at this Day consist with that Justice and Equality with a View to which they were originally framed The intelligent Reader need not be told that the frequent Use if not the Invention of Coaches and all those various Species of WheelCarriage the sole End whereof is the Conveyance of Persons from one Place to another is of far less Antiquity than the first of the Statutes above cited and it is far from being Matter of absolute certainty that a Cart drawn by  two  Horses only is in Construction of Law a Draught  Dalton  who wrote before the Year seems to make it a Question whether it is or no when he says  "I find that a Draught for the King's Carriages heretofore hath been sometimes with two Horses as it seemeth by the Statute of  Magna Charta cap  "  The Words of the Statute be  "No Sheriffe  c  shall take the Horses or Carts of any Person for Carriage except he pay for one Cart with two Horses Tenpence by the Day and for a Cart with three Horses Fourteenpence by the Day and therefore I think him that usually goeth to Cart for his own Business  with two Horses to be chargeable to find a Cart and two Horses for the Amending of the Highways and to carry such Loads as his two Horses are well able to draw"  Here we see the Author above quoted driven to the Necessity of reasoning from Analogy in Order to shew that a Cart which is constantly used for the Purposes of Husbandry and was an Implement in use so long ago as  Magna Charta  if drawn but with two Horses is a Draught within the Meaning of the Statute of  Phil Mar  and after all his Opinion does not seem as some others of his have to have been adopted by any subsequent Statute or established by any Judicial Determination  If this then is the Case in the Instance abovementioned what are we to think of that of  Coaches Chariots  and  PostChaises  which have no Relation to Agriculture or Husbandry and were scarcely known at the Time of making the Statute Or indeed if we consider that the Occupiers of such Carriages are throughout the Kingdom exempted from the greater StatuteDuty what can we think but that there is no Law in Being which in respect to the StatuteLabour required of each of them does distinguish between the highest and lowest Rank of Subjects  It has indeed been asserted though on very slender Authority that this Matter did once receive the Determination of Sir  Matthew Hale  whose Opinion is said to have been that Coaches and Chariots were included under the Appellation of a Draught and that such as kept them were liable to do StatuteDuty in like Manner as those who kept Teams but we have no authentic Report of any such Determination and the Practice throughout the Kingdom is to consider such Persons merely as Householders  There are some Propositions so evident that they are incapable of Demonstration for which Reason it is sufficient to say that as the Law now stands a Nobleman of the highest Rank that does not occupy  l  a Year in Land or keep a Team and there are many who do neither and who is continually wearing the Highways with his Horses and his Carriages is legally chargeable with Six Days Labour in a Year or the Payment of Nine Shillings in Lieu thereof and that the poor DayLabourer the Cottager who has a Wife and perhaps three or four Infant Children to feed and clothe whose only use of the public Highway is the walking on it to and from his daily Labour is chargeable precisely to the same Amount  My Lord  Coke  somewhere observes that those Laws which impose a Penalty disproportionate to the Offence are very seldom executed and the Reason is that in all such Cases the general Humanity both of those that should inform and those that should convict interposes and so the Offender escapes with Impunity The same may be said of every Law that seems to be either unnecessarily or inadequately severe and to apply this Observation to the Case now before us we find that the lower Class of those who are charged with Six Days manual Labour from a Sense of the Hardship of such a Burthen either do it partially or not at all and in the latter Case being Contuments they are liable to the Penalties and so become amenable to the Justices for their Neglect  The Power of the Justices in mitigating the Severity of the Law is restrained to very few Cases the  reasonable Excuse  which the Statutes of  Car    cap    sect  and  Geo cap    sect  allow cannot operate in the Case of a Person whom the Law has expressly charged and such as are unable to labour are specifically discharged To whom then are the Justices to extend this their Clemency perhaps after all to those few Persons only whose short Residence in a Parish would make it unreasonable to charge them with any StatuteDuty If then the Justices  are bound to issue their Warrant against every poor Defaulter for the whole of the Nine Shillings and if every Commutation or Composition be as undoubtedly it is illegal let it be considered how reluctantly this Power must necessarily be executed and how much it is the Interest of every poor Man rather than conform to the Law to disobey it and trust to all the Chances in his Favour that it will never be executed against him  With all due Deference therefore to the Wisdom of those concerned in framing them we may venture to assert that the Laws now under Consideration are at this Day at least inconsistent with those general Principles of Justice and Equity from which every Law in the Estimation of good Men is supposed to derive its Authority  Nor does the Statute of  Phil Mar  appear at all more defensible if we consider it in a  political  View A Law without a Sanction is but a dead Letter and such does that appear to be which we are now considering Suppose a Farmer is required by the Statute as occupying a Ploughland or keeping a Draught to send a Team to work Six Days on the Highways and that he is averse to the Performance of this Duty what is the legal Motive to Obedience in this Case The Answer is the Fear of incurring  the Penalty but perhaps it may be more his Interest to incur the Penalty than to avoid it Let us consider whether it is or not  The Labour of a Cart a Team and one Man is in most Places estimated at Ten Shillings a Day If the Farmer lets them out to a neighbouring Gentleman they will earn the Owner that Money but if he sends his Cart and Team with two Men to work on the Highways the Labour of them all will excuse him from the Payment of no larger a Sum so that if he lets out his Team and incurs the Forfeiture he saves the Labour of one Man and the Statute is so far from being penal in this Respect that it is pregnant with a Motive to Disobedience and this is certain that no Man will ever send his Cart and Team to Highwaywork if he can either let them out or find Employment for them at Home  In like Manner may the DayLabourer argue with himself and conclude that if he must either actually perform or forfeit the Price of Six Days Labour the latter is as eligible as the former with this Difference that if he does his Work it is a certain Loss to his Family of a whole Week's Subsistence whereas if he omits it the Payment of the Penalty is contingent  This Defect it must however be confessed is owing solely to the Diminution in the Value of Money since the enacting the Statute now under Consideration Bishop  Fleetwood  in his  Chronicon Pretiosum cap  V has shewn that in which was not a great many Years before this Statute was made the Wages of a Labourer from  Easter  to  Michaelmas  except in Harvest were Fourpence and from  Michaelmas  to  Easter  Threepence by the Day and though he has not mentioned it expresly we may there find Reasons to conclude that the Labour of a Waggon and Team with two Men was worth about Two Shillings and Eightpence by the Day And by the Statute it appears that at that Time as it is now the Penalty for every Day's Default of those who were to send a Team was Ten Shillings and of those who were to labour One Shilling now if we compare these Forfeitures with the respective Duties they were intended to enforce we shall find them to have been penal to a sufficient Degree at the Time of making the Statute but the Case is otherwise at present  It has been urged that whether the Person charged does actually perform or pay the Price of his Duty the Case is the same to the Public inasmuch as the Forfeiture will purchase just as  much Labour and Assistance as was originally required of him and if that is done it is nothing to the Public what Hands were employed in it  In Answer to this it may be said that it seems as if the Makers of the Statute thought otherwise when they made the Penalty in both Cases more than treble the Value of the Duty required Besides is it of no Consequence to a State whether the Laws are obeyed or not we all know that the increase of penal Laws is one of the most inflaming Topics of popular Clamour and that every additional Statute of that Sort is an Addition to the Power of factious and designing Men to distress a Government Is it not therefore of some Importance to the State whether a Law which has solely the public Good for its Object is constantly to wear the Face of a remedial or a penal one  Let us now see in what Manner the Law at present under Consideration is observed in those few Parishes where the Inhabitants are disposed to yield Obedience to the Letter of it the Days for performing the StatuteDuty are so far from being considered as Days of Labour that as well the Farmers as the common DayLabourers have long been used to look on them as Holidays as a kind of Recess from their accustomed  Labour and devoted to Idleness and its concomitant Indulgences of Riot and Drunkenness Besides as this Labour where it is performed may in some Degree be said to be voluntary we are not to wonder if such as employ themselves in it are less obedient to the Directions of those whom the Law has appointed to superintend it than is consistent with the due Discharge of their Duty What is the Benefit arising from the Labour of twenty Men and as many Horses occupied in four or five different Stations within an extensive Parish compared with that of half the Number of each working under the immediate Direction of an Officer and executing a Plan which he himself has concerted and sees the Tendency and Advantages of  And this naturally leads us to reflect a little how inadequate in respect of its Duration is the Authority of the Surveyors to the Ends proposed in the Institution of the Office we will suppose a Surveyor to be as the Statute of  Will Mar  requires a Man of Substance and inclined to execute the Office faithfully and that he is what no Statute can make him a Judge of Roads and the Art of making and repairing them whatever Schemes he shall form on his taking on him the Office he has in Effect but Six Days to execute we must therefore suppose  that he will hardly think of any Repairs Alterations or Amendments but what may be done in that Time by such of the Inhabitants as have usually preferred the doing their StatuteDuty to paying the Forfeiture Besides this inevitable Restraint on the Officer in respect to the Latitude of his Operations we see he can have no Dependence on those who should execute them and in Case they should fail to assist he as will be immediately shewn is destitute of a Resource For  Suppose him desirous of mending a foundrous Way and that in Pursuance of the Direction in the Statute of  Car  and with a View of getting it done before Harvest on the first Day of  May  which is as soon as in many Places the Falling of the Waters will permit the Digging of Gravel he gives Notice in the Church of the Six Days and requires the Inhabitants to do their StatuteWork and suppose also that all those whom he expects to attend do not come in and that in Favour of his Neighbours he repeats this Notice indulging them with further Time and that after all they make Default what is to become of the intended Repair and how is the Way to be amended  Why it will perhaps be said Let the Surveyor apply the Forfeitures incurred by the several  Defaults in the Hire of Teams and Men and go on with his Work very true but first he is to receive them in Order to which he is to enter upon a new Work namely to bring the Defaulters to Justice And first he is to make out a List of their Names which when completed is to be returned to the Sessions which may possibly be to be held either in a Week or in four Months after the Offence the Justices upon this Return of Course issue Summonses for the Defaulters to shew Cause in a reasonable Time why they will not pay after this if they do not comply DistressWarrants are issued before the Execution whereof the wet Weather sets in and there is an End of RoadWork for that Year The Surveyor is then busied in making up his Account against the  January  Sessions or perhaps in defending Actions grounded on some Irregularity in the Notice the due Publication whereof or of the respective Defaults not one in Fifty of them is ever prepared to prove when  January  comes his Account is passed and he pays the Balance to the new Surveyor who will have just the same Difficulties to encounter as his Predecessor  And yet perhaps the worst Consequences are behind every one knows that the Law in general requires that the Highways throughout the Kingdom shall be kept in Repair by the several Parishes of which they are Part The  Law has established a Form of Proceeding by Way of Indictment against the Parishioners upon which if the Defendants are found guilty they shall not be discharged by submitting to a Fine but a  Distringas  shall go  in Infinitum  till they repair This Remedy may seem to have been founded on the Statute of  Winton  yet by the Passage above quoted from  Britton  it appears to have been Part of the antient Common Law of the Realm of which the Statute is but a Recognition  The Statute of  Eliz cap    sect  has prescribed another Method of Proceeding which though seemingly different is in Effect much the same as that of an Indictment which is by a Presentment of the Surveyors to the next Justice who is to certify the same at the next General Sessions and the Sessions is immediately to enquire of the Defaulters Now notwithstanding the seeming Efficacy of the Word  immediately  yet the general Opinion on that Clause of the Statute is that the Certificate of the Justice in this Case has not the Effect of a Presentment but must be turned into an Indictment to which by the Rules of Law the Offender may enter his Traverse and no Trial can be had till the Sessions after  Each of these Methods of Proceeding seems liable to great Objection for as to the first the  Law does not distinguish those who have done from those who have refused to do their Statute Work but pronounces its Judgment indiscriminately against the whole Parish from whence follows this apparent Injustice that the Innocent and the Guilty are involved in the same Punishment  As to the Method of proceeding by Presentment under the Statute of  Eliz  we shall soon see that it is not productive of that expeditious Justice which the Statute gives Reason to expect for suppose twenty or thirty persons are required to work on the Highways the Week after  Easter  Sessions and that they make Default or refuse to work when they are out the Surveyor in such Case is by the Statute of  Eliz  to present the Defaulters to the next Justice of the Peace who is to certify this Presentment to the next General QuarterSessions of the Peace that is the Summer Sessions following when we will suppose the Defaulters are indicted now if it should be  Christmas  Sessions before this Indictment can be tried and sooner it cannot well be here is a whole Summer lost and nothing is done to the Repair of the Highways for from the Moment a Prosecution is commenced a total Defection is sure to follow and there is an End of all legal Obedience and if any Mistake in the Manner of conducting it or any Defect of Proof should occasion a Failure the Offenders are  supposed to have triumphed over the Law and it is odds if they ever after do any Duty  The Delay and Expence of these Methods of proceeding are Objections common to them both and it is most ardently to be wished that as well for these Reasons as because of their Inefficacy they were either totally abolished or so regulated as to be more effectual  And here it may be proper to take Notice of the Difficulty that the Justices are under with respect to the Measure of their Authority in the Case of Non performance of the StatuteDuty for though it has been said that by the Statute of  Eliz  the Surveyors are to present the Defaulters to the next Justice who is to certify the Presentment to the Sessions yet the subsequent Statute of  Car    cap    sect  requires the Justice on the Oath of one Witness to levy the Penalties of  s  and  s    d  notwithstanding which  sect  of the same Statute directs the same Method of Proceeding at the Sessions as is prescribed by the Statute of  Eliz  Again the Statute of  Will Mar cap    sect  enacts that all Offences and Neglects respecting the publick Roads be presented by the Surveyor on Oath to some Justice of the Peace within the Division but the Act does not direct what is to be done with the Presentment  nor can any one conclude that the Justice is to certify it unless from the Second Section of the Statute which enacts that all the former Laws relating to the Highways shall be executed according to the Tenor of those Laws  Besides all this the Statute of  Geo cap  is so worded that it seems doubtful whether all the Authority given by former Acts as to these Matters is not taken away and the Jurisdiction vested in the Special Sessions  There is an Inconvenience that attends the Discharge of the Surveyor's Office different from those already enumerated for whereas they are supposed to arise from Disobedience to the Law this is the Consequence of a Compliance with it The Statutes direct that a general Notice be published in every Parish requiring the Inhabitants to come in and perform their StatuteWork on the Six several Days mentioned in such Notice suppose then that they all attend and declare their Readiness to Work how are the Surveyors to employ them In most Places the getting ready the Materials is a Step necessarily previous to working in the Repair of the Highways Gravel must be dug before it can be spread and till that is done not only Teams but more than a few Hands are of no Use and the Surveyor by calling out the  whole Parish at once puts himself in the hopeless Situation of a Magician who according to the vulgar Notion having raised a Spirit whom he cannot employ is immediately in his Power and in Danger of being torn in Pieces There are a few Instances of local Statutes obtained on the Application of particular Parishes whereby the Labour is converted into a Rate and this Method if it were universally practised would undoubtedly take away this and many other Objections against the Law as it now stands but as all the Acts of Parliament since that of  Phil Mar  have proceeded to enforce the StatuteDuty and as none of the many various Proposals for amending the Highways which have from Time to Time been submitted to the Public have ventured to assert the Expediency of annihilating that Duty we may very justly conclude that the Reasons in Favour of it lie deeper than is generally thought and it would therefore be great Presumption in any private Person to say that the same Advantages are to be expected from any Rate or Assessment as are capable of being produced by a just and equitable Apportionment of the StatuteDuty  But to return to the Duty of the Surveyor it has hitherto been admitted that he is what every one would wish him to be a skillful Man in the Business of Roadmaking but what must be the Consequence if we suppose him to  be otherwise A Farmer or if he is an Inhabitant of a Town a Tradesman as ignorant of this kind of Business as Ninety nine Men in every Hundred throughout the Kingdom are found to be what blessed Effects are like to follow from a Contest between Ignorance armed with Authority on the one Side and invincible Obstinacy to call it perhaps by a worse Name than it deserves on the other  These are some and but a few of the Difficulties that attend the Execution of the Surveyor's Office but what are these compared to those of the Magistrates who are to execute the Law in this Respect as it now seems to stand Imagine a Hundred or more of the most indigent Inhabitants of a Parish attending to assign Reasons for not doing what in natural Justice they ought never to have been required to do Imagine these Reasons to be Poverty a numerous Family a Wife and four five or more small Children Sickness Lameness and an Income of Nine Shillings a Week to provide for them all Food Raiment and other Necessaries and think whether that Authority is to be envied which the Magistrates are sworn to exert in the enforcing Obedience to perhaps one of the most oppressive Statutes that ever yet received the Sanction of public Assent  In the Course of the above Reflections it has been assumed that the Surveyors are in general disposed to pursue the Directions of the Law in the Execution of their Office but in Truth it is very seldom that they do so one Error into which they almost universally run is the considering the respective Forfeitures for every Day's Default as a  Tax  or  Rate  than which nothing can be more absurd in Consequence whereof their Practice is as soon as they enter into their Office to assess  ex Officio  every Inhabitant in a Sum proportionable to the Labour required of him which they proceed to collect with as little Hesitation as the proper Officers do the Poor's Rate whereas it is evident that these several Sums are not due till the Persons on whom they are charged have made Default And this Error naturally induces a general Inattention to the Manner of publishing the Notice which they suppose is to operate against only a few and therefore is but little more than Matter of Form  There are two Mischiefs that attend this Practice the one of a private and the other of a public Nature the one is that every Individual of whom Money has been collected in this Manner has undoubtedly his Action at Law against the Surveyor for the Sum so collected of him the other is that when the Notice has  been so negligently given as that the Publication thereof cannot be proved by an uninterested Witness a Person not himself liable to do StatuteWork in the Parish who can swear to the Reading it by the Clerk and is prepared with a Copy of what he heard read it is odds but every Shilling of the Money forfeited is lost to the Parish  This Behaviour of Surveyors as also that Corruption which we see daily practised by them in garbling the Inhabitants of a Parish commuting with them for their Duty receiving of some five of others four Shillings half a Crown or what many of them like better a Bowl of Punch are punishable by a Fine of  l  which the Justices in their Sessions have Power to impose though a much severer Punishmentwould await an Officer who should dare to abuse his Trust in such a Manner  But this and many other Evils of the like Nature are in a great Measure owing to the Practice of electing Tradesmen and Persons in a Situation necessarily dependent and subject to Influence into parochial Offices There are many Parishes in this Kingdom where all the Offices of Churchwarden Overseer of the Poor Surveyor of the Highways and Constable are borne by a few of the Inferior Inhabitants in a Rotation so quick as hardly to allow of a single Year's Respite  for any one of them while the Gentlemen perhaps from a Contempt of an Employment which requires little more than to be able to write and keep a Year's Account or for other Reasons sit by and see the Public defrauded and the Law eluded There is an Obligation which every Man is under who participates in the Benefits that accrue to Society from Government and Laws which will render it very difficult for those who are qualified and are unengaged in Trades or Professions to find an Excuse for such Supineness those who can do it are welcome to all the Satisfaction it can afford them A Method which has been practised in some Parishes and is constantly pursued in a very considerable one adjacent to the Metropolis of joining a Gentleman of large Fortune or perhaps a Nobleman with a Tradesman in a parochial Office has been found to produce considerable Advantages and were it to become universally a Fashion the Public would soon be sensible of its good Effects  Such are the Inconveniencies the Public feel and the Hardships that the lower Class of People endure in the several Particulars above insisted on the repeated Complaints of those who are most affected by the Inequality of the HighwayLaws have never yet prevailed further than to produce such Amendments and Alterations from Time to Time as the immediate Exigencies  of the Case suggested How far the Laws in this Respect are even now short of that Degree of Perfection which they are capable of being wrought up to we may in some Measure collect from the Sentiments of Mr  Burn  who says that  "Most of the Books are remarkably confused under this Title occasioned by a Multiplicity of Statutes standing unrepealed and yet altered perhaps five or six Times or oftener by succeeding Statutes"  Burn's Justice  Tit  Highways  at the BeginningHe afterwards gives his Sense of this Matter more at large in the following Terms  "Notwithstanding that the Wisdom of the Nation hath been employed for above Two hundred Years in redressing the great Evil of bad Roads yet excepting in some Cases where Turnpikes have been erected the Roads are as bad now as they were in the Days of  Philip Mary  and the Defect is in many Places not so much the Want of Hands as of proper Direction The same Multitudes which assemble to demolish a Turnpike at the Hazard of their Liberty and Lives are able and I doubt not would be willing if rightly instructed to make the Roads good without paying TurnpikeTolls but the Misfortune is this although the Laws have provided that the Surveyors shall be chosen out of the more substantial Inhabitants yet when that is done scarce one of them in Five hundred knows how to make a good  Road and if he does his Power continues in Effect but Six Days and his Successor probably hath other Schemes and Notions and the Road is made never the better Hence it is that when the People assemble to repair the Highways if indeed they do assemble they spend the Time in Diversions and making Bargains and other idle Amusements and why should they not they may as well meet and do nothing as work hard and to no Purpose And from so many Years Experience the Case will never be any otherwise unless the Justices of the Peace or others in like Manner as the TurnpikeTrustees shall have Power given to them by Act of Parliament to appoint general Surveyors within proper Districts with Salaries to lay out the Roads and attend and direct the Work and see the StatuteLabour well performed And this may be effected without any new Assessment or Charge half the present Assessment of Sixpence in the Pound or even less than half would be sufficient in many Places both to find Salaries and to widen and purchase Roads where needful and the People when they should find the Benefit of their Labour would work with Chearfulness  Burn's Just Highways  There is nothing in the Passage above cited that indicates a Necessity for annihilating the  StatuteDuty on the contrary the Author's Proposal for an Alteration of the Laws seems to imply the Continuance of it and indeed it is well worthy the Attention of Parliament how far it may be prudent to indulge the People in their present Belief of the Omnipotence of Wealth The Practice of commuting with Money for Personal Services and manual Labour will ever tend to render them Scandalous  Homer  whose Writings are supposed to exhibit a very just Picture of the antient Modes of Living seems to have thought it no Degradation of a Hero to make him his own Cook on the contrary in the present refined State of human Manners it would be reproachful for a Person of but ordinary Rank to perform many of the Functions necessary to his own Support the Time may come when Agriculture and other rural Employments will be as dishonourable in  England  as they have long been in  Spain  and when the Evil of bad Roads will be more tolerable than the Disgrace of having contributed any otherwise to the Amendment of them than by a Display of that Opulence which seems now to be the most desirable Distinction between Man and Man With good Reason therefore did the antient Policy of our Constitution render the basest Services honourable by converting them into feudal Tenures and requiring the Nobility to do that for their Sovereign which they would now disdain to do for themselves  The Objections which Mr  Burn  makes are in Truth reducible to two the Multiplicity of the Laws in the Instance now under Consideration and the ill Direction of the Power given by them the latter of these Inconveniencies may undoubtedly be remedied by committing that Power to those who have no Temptations to abuse it but the former is an Objection of Weight is of general Importance and requires a very serious Attention  The Statutes relating to the Amendment and Repair of the Highways are not fewer than twelve in Number made at different Times as Necessity required and abounding with Clauses which the utmost Skill in the Modes of legal reasoning will not enable us to reconcile Clauses in the older Statutes have been suffered to stand unrepealed though such Clauses were altered and amended by subsequent Acts different Penalties have been inflicted for the same Transgression by different Statutes all of which are yet suffered to subsist and thus the Highway Laws have insensibly accumulated to such a Degree as to become a Subject of universal Complaint  It is true that the Multiplicity of our Statute Laws has been so long lamented that Objections of this Sort are looked on as trite and as they  contain nothing but what has been urged before unworthy the public Attention It is near twenty Years since  Montesquieu  endeavoured to palliate this Misfortune by remarking that the Multiplicity of the  English  Laws is the Price that the People of that Country pay for their Liberty but what Equivalent can they expect for that Premium when the Laws become so numerous that they cannot be executed and those whom they were intended to bind are thereby in Effect absolved from their Obedience what Reason there is to fear that this may one Day be the Case will appear on reflecting on the enormous Increase in the Volume of our Statute Book within these few Years Six Years after the Revolution two Folio Volumes contained the public Statutes in Force from  Magna Charta  By the Seventh Year of the late King they were grown to Six and at the Expiration of the Thirtieth Year of his Reign which was Twenty three Years after they amounted to Nine during which Period not a single Session passed that did not add several Statutes to that incredible Number which the Justices already had in Charge to see executed  What a tremendous Prospect then has the Magistrate before his Eyes who resolves to discharge his Duty by the legal and conscientious Exertion of his Authority  Lambarde  that learned and sagacious Writer and faithful Servant of the Public in his  Eirenarcha  written so long ago as the  Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  enumerates but eight Statutes that concerned the Justices of the Peace which in his quaint Way of expressing himself were then thought a Load sufficient to break the Back of any Justice and now those Statutes are encreased to a Number not far short of Two hundred  Indeed the Legislature have in some few Instances yielded to the pressing Necessity of the Times and consolidated several Statutes relating to one common Subject particularly in the Cases of the Navy and Militia Acts into one general Law this Method was originally suggested by the great Lord  Verulam  to his Master  James  the First and we find in the  Journals of the House of Commons    Car  a Vote  "That a Committee be appointed to confer with such of the Lords the Judges and other Persons of the Long Robe who have already taken Pains and made Progress in perusing the StatuteLaws and to consider of repealing such former StatuteLaws as they shall find necessary to be repealed and of Expedients of reducing all StatuteLaws of one Nature under such a Method and Head as may conduce to the more ready understanding and better Execution of such Laws"  Journals of the House of Commons Octob    Car  The same Proposal has been often reiterated with Respect to the Laws relating to the Poor but without Effect and except the  Instances abovementioned it has never yet been carried into Execution  Whoever has been used to turn over our Statute Book will have other Reasons than those above assigned to wish that some such Regulation as this may soon take Place in the Instance now before us for not to mention the Confusion that necessarily follows from the frequent militant Clauses to be met with in many of them the very Language of some of our Statutes is very inartificial and reflects but little Honour on those that framed them There is a Statute of  Geo cap  relating to  Buttonmaking  which  Burn  calls a  loose injudicious  and  ungrammatical  Act and adds that it may well enough seem to have been drawn up by  Taylors  or  Buttonmakers  themselves the Perspicuity and Precision of many of our old Statutes are standing Evidences how much our Ancestors exceeded us in the Science of Legislation  Magna Charta  allowing for some Barbarisms made inevitable by the Use of a Language extinct long before the Objects of that Law had any Existence is in these Respects a model of Perfection and the Statute  De donis conditionalibus  the Statutes of  Uses  and of  Frauds and Perjuries  are admirable Efforts of human Wisdom and Policy  For the Reasons above stated it is with all due Deference apprehended that the several Statutes  now in Force relating to the Highways stand in need of a Review and that those Statutes may be so altered amended and improved as to be clear of most of the Difficulties that at present obstruct their Execution that half the Labour and Expence which the Public are at present at would suffice to keep the Highways in as good Condition as the TurnpikeRoads are now in and that the Burthen of amending them from Time to Time might be imposed in such a Manner as to do no Injury to the Rich and take away all Possibility of Complaint from the Poor and lastly that an Act of Parliament calculated with these Views might be so framed as to be as easy in its Execution as laudable in its Design  The principal Objects to be attended to in the framing a Law for these Purposes are that the Burthen thereby to be laid on the Public be proportionable to the respective Circumstances and Abilities of those who are to bear it and that those who make the greatest Use of the Highways should contribute most to keep them in Repair More particularly Care should be taken to extend the Qualification of  l  a Year to Houses Lands and every other Species of Tenement and Hereditament lying as the Law phrases it in  Livery  The Tax on Gentlemen of large personal Estates and who keep Coaches Chariots and other WheelCarriages should be  adjusted in a Compound  Ratio  of their Wealth and the Use they are supposed to make of the Highways Those who shall have the Superintendence of the Highways should be Persons of greater Property than are usually appointed to that Office and perhaps it might be expedient to invest the Justices with an Authority to appoint some one Person skilled in the Business of Roadmaking as a Kind of perpetual Surveyor removeable nevertheless at Pleasure and whose Business it should be for a Salary to lay out the Roads and attend and direct the Work as those do who are appointed by Turnpike Trustees and who shall be amenable to the Justices and answerable at Law in like Manner as the Surveyors at present are  The above Observations sufficiently shew the Necessity and the Justice of instituting a new Class of Contributors to the Repair of the Highways namely Persons who keep Coaches Chariots or other WheelCarriages When that is done the Proportions in which they are respectively to contribute may be adjusted thus  Let  Ten  Days be appointed for the Amendment of the Highways instead of  Six  and let every Person occupying two or more Ploughlands send a Draught on every of those Days and let him that occupies only one Ploughland send a Draught five Days only on Pain to forfeit in the first  Case and also in the other  s  for every Day's Default Persons occupying divers Ploughlands in divers Parishes should send a Draught five Days for each Ploughland Those who are not to send a Draught may be charged according to the following Scheme  Persons occupying  l  a Year to send a Labourer  Days    l    or forfeit  s  a Day                                  But as all the Inhabitants are not to work on every one of the Ten Days and to prevent the assembling of more of them than the Surveyors can employ the Surveyors besides publishing Notice in the Church should have Power given them to call out by Summons in Writing the several Persons by such Numbers at a Time as they shall find necessary  Persons who keep Coaches Chariots or PostChaises for their own Use and not for Hire and are not charged as Landholders should pay  s  if with four Horses  s  and if with six Horses    s  a Year over and above their Proportion of Labour  This Mode of Taxation it is to be observed is calculated rather to preserve the Highways in a continual State of Repair than to answer immediate Exigencies it will therefore be necessary to continue the Power of making Assessments in the Manner prescribed by the Laws now in Force which Power may be exercised either for immediate Improvements or in Aid of the StatuteDuty  Something also should be done with Respect to Evidence It is an uncontested Rule in Law that no Person can be a Witness to a Fact which will either directly or consequentially affect his own Interest The Law in a general View is doubtless very reasonable that thus disqualifies a Man and yet his Interest may be so small or so remote in a particular Instance as to contribute no more towards determining his Evidence than a single Hair does to the Trepidation of a ScaleBeam capable of suspending a Ton Weight notwithstanding which the Law knows no Difference in Degree and its Care to prevent the Operation of insensible Prejudices is uniformly the same in all Cases How great that Care is supposed to be we may infer from the Conduct of the late Lord  Raymond  in an Instance yet in the Memory of Persons now living who being Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench  because he lived in the Parish of  Abbot's Langley  in the County of  Hertford  went off the Bench when an Order relating to that Parish came before the Court See  Strange's Reports  It is doubtless for Reasons of this Kind that a Freeman of a corporate Town is no legal Witness to a local Custom within that Town and the Practice is for such a one in that Case to suffer himself to be disenfranchised before he gives his Evidence In the Case now under Consideration a Parishioner who should swear to any of the Facts which make a Part of that Chain of Evidence requisite to justify a Distress on a Defaulter such as the Publication of Notice of the Six Days appointed for doing the Statute Work the NonAttendance of the Defaulter the Service of the Summons to shew Cause  c  would by such his Evidence contribute to exonerate the Parish and himself as a Parishioner from an Assessment which the Nonperformance of the StatuteLabour might make necessary it is therefore apprehended that no Parishioner is a competent Witness in this Case and that even the ParishClerk could not be examined to prove the Publication in his Church of Notice of the Six Days even though he read it himself nor in short can any one be a Witness for this Purpose but a Stranger in the Parish or a Servant or other Person not liable to do StatuteDuty We know that in Favour of Justice the Law has frequently interposed to remove legal Disabilities of Witnesses and others  By a late Statute the Testimony of Persons interested in the Establishment of a Will is admissable to prove the Execution of it in particular Cases By a Statute of  Geo    cap  Justices may execute the Laws for punishing Vagrants repairing the Highways and the other Laws concerning parochial Taxes Levies or Rates notwithstanding they are rated or chargeable with the Rates within any Place affected by such their Acts And by  Geo    cap  for licensing AleHouses any Person shall be a competent Witness upon any Information or Complaint for any Offence against that Act notwithstanding such Person be an Inhabitant of or charged to the Payment of any Rates for the Relief of the Poor of any Parish or Place where such Offence shall be committed and a Clause of Two or three Lines would supply the Defect here complained of save considerable Sums and prevent vexatious Suits in many Parishes  The Advantages arising from the Use of broad Wheels are so apparent that it would be needless to insist on them this is certain that by means of them the Price of Carriage from  York  to  London  has been reduced  per Cent  Whether it be not practicable to render the Use of them still more general may be worthy Consideration At present they are found not to succeed so well in cross Ways as in the great  Roads the former are in most Countries so confined by the Inclosures on each Side as to admit of but one Track whereas were Power given to the Justices to widen those Ways enough to allow of quartering the Use of broad Wheels would become universal and produce the same Benefit as in the great High Roads where as has often been observed they do the Office of a Roller  The mischievous Practice of riding in Carts is not yet sufficiently checked by the many Laws lately made to prevent it certainly there is as much Reason to empower a Justice to convict on a View of this Offence as in any other Case where this Power is given  In the penning of such a Statute as is here proposed Regard should be had to the Determinations of Courts particularly of the King's Bench on Appeals from Sessions upon particular Points and those Clauses that have been enforced by any such Determinations should be carefully preserved as on the contrary those that have been condemned or adjudged nugatory should be amended or totally rejected  It has been urged as a general Argument against an Alteration of the HighwayLaws with Regard to the Proportion of the StatuteLabour that the seeming Inequality of the Law is at last  set right by the Advantages accruing to the Poor from the Cheapness and Plenty which result from good Roads and a speedy Conveyance of the Necessaries of Life But are these Advantages peculiar to the Poor do not the Rich partake of them nay have they not by much the greatest Share A poor Labourer who earns  s  a Week pays yearly a twoandfiftieth Part of his Year's Income for these Advantages whatever they are does a rich Man pay after that Rate Is there any Gentleman of a Thousand Pounds a Year in the Kingdom though he keeps a Coach and wears the Roads more in a Week than such a Man can possibly do in ten Years who pays Nineteen Pounds a Year to the Highways  There are it must be confessed some Prejudices of a different Nature against the inferior Class of People in this Kingdom which seem to stand in the Way of any Regulations of this Sort in their Behalf namely their extreme Licentiousness beyond what is seen in other Countries their Contempt of Religion and the Laws their Want of Respect for their Superiors their Idleness Profaneness Intemperance and a Number of other Vices  Before we proceed to refute the Arguments commonly deduced from these Premisses let us enquire whether the Fact has any Foundation  or not It is certain that the lower Sort of People amongst us are neither so dissolute nor ungovernable as they have been in Times which we have been taught to look on with more Reverence than perhaps is due to them Tumults and Insurrections are much less frequent than they were formerly and those who magnify the Vices of the common People and represent them as less obedient to Government than heretofore forget that they have within these very few Years seen Thousands of these People actuated by some one common Principle whatever it has been forsaking their Relations and Friends exposing their Lives in Defence of their Country and extending the Reputation of its Courage and Humanity beyond that of any Nation in the World  As to their Intemperance it has never been so great as to be beyond the Power of Laws to reduce it within tolerable Limits those lately made to restrain the Use of spirituous Liquors are Instances how much it is in the Power of a Legislature to effect  But admitting the Justice of the above Charge and that the lower Sort of People are ever so dissolute shall we therefore deny them Justice for that as far as it concerns them is all that is now contended for shall we refuse to discharge them from a greater Load of public Duty  than they are able to bear at the same Time that we are with a Zeal unequalled in any preceding Age and with a Charity as sincere as it is wild and injudicious anticipating their Wants setting their selfish and social Affections at Variance and even laying in their Way Temptations to Idleness and those other Vices of which we accuse them  The Truth of the Matter is that Subjects of this Nature strictly speaking are Part of the grand Science of Politics the very first Principles whereof very few are able to conceive and which still fewer are able to reason about who can pretend to say how much the Immorality of any People exceeds that Degree of it which seems to be interwoven in the Constitution of the moral World All that concerns us as Men is to discourage it as much as possible for which Purpose it has ever been the Practice of wise Legislators to consider human Nature as it really is rather than as what they would wish it to be to encourage Virtue and keep down Immorality by proper Sanctions and so to temper the various and conflicting Appetites and Humours of Mankind as to produce good upon the whole  There are various Causes which contribute to produce that Licentiousness of which we so much complain one of the most prevailing seems to be the little Attention that Men at this Day are  disposed to pay to Virtue as it results from Principle our very Modes of Expression imply our Disregard of it we no longer say of a Man that he is a Man of Integrity or Probity or that he is beneficent or charitable but that he has a  good Heart  is a  good Sort  of Man or a  good Creature  for which cant Phrases we are indebted to the fertile Invention of a deceased Wit whose Writings paltry and flimsy as they are it is to be feared may do more Mischief to Society than those of  Hobbes  or  Spinoza  The inevitable Consequence of that loose System of Morality by which the real or supposed Goodness of a Man's Intention and not the Dictates of those who have a Right to govern is made the Rule of his Conduct is the Contempt of all positive Institutions of Law of Religion itself  The Law considered as a Rule of Action and as calculated to extend and improve the Blessings of social Life is next to Religion an Object the most venerable but such is the Temper of Mankind that they look on it with Abhorrence and form Confederacies to defeat its Purposes necessary Penalties to enforce the most beneficial Statutes are considered as Infractions of private Liberty and it is much less criminal in the Eye of the Public to offend against such a Law than it is to assist in bringing the Offender to Justice the Man who instead  of driving rides in his Cart in Contempt of the Law and at the Risque of the Lives of his Fellow subjects is far less odious to the Populace than he who shall inform against him and thus it may be said that the Laws and the People are in a State of perpetual Hostility  The State of Magistracy is therefore  "a painful Preeminence"  in which a Man becomes odious by doing Good and he whose public Spirit would induce him to take upon himself the trouble of procuring Obedience to the Laws of his Country must relinquish the Endeavour if he has not also Fortitude enough to despise the secret Malevolence of those who have formed an erroneous Judgment of the Extent of civil Liberty and the clamourous Invectives of others who consider the slandering and traducing the Characters of all in Authority as the Birthright of an  Englishman  For this Reason we see so many Persons whose Knowledge and Abilities enable them to promote the Quiet Safety and Happiness of Mankind as Magistrates decline that Service and a Trust of the greatest Importance to the Lives and Liberties of  English  Subjects executed in some Instances by Mercenaries but it is surely to be wished that instead of indulging a selfish Indolence and Timidity they would exert themselves in the common Cause and endeavour  to avoid the Obloquy which so generally attends the producing remote  nd general good by inflicting the immediate and particular Evil of Punishment not by eluding the Duty but by shewing that they discharge it upon Principles of true Benevolence and that while they distinguish themselves in their public Capacity by their Diligence and Activity to mark and to punish Offences they would also recommend themselves in private Life by the Exercise of those milder Virtues which give Lustre to the most exalted Station  The Service of the Public is indeed declined in some Instances which admit of no Apology Can it be thought that our early Forefathers ever imagined that a Time would come when nearly all the Freeholders of a whole County should submit to an annual Contribution levied by the meanest of its Servants the legal Retinue of a Sheriff to avoid serving on Juries or that the Legislature would ever find it necessary to hire Men of Estates to do that Duty which every Friend to Liberty should rejoice at being called to  Instances of public spirit however are not wanting among us What Difficulties what Discouragements have those Gentlemen surmounted who from the noblest Motives have laboured in the Establishment of a national Militia  a Measure to which next to the Providence of God this Country may be said to owe its Salvation  But whatever are the Faults of the Times it certainly behoves every Government to provide that the Laws are at least free from Oppression or Inequality those which are here examined are manifestly not so and whoever has Weight and Interest enough to procure such Alterations and Amendments of them as upon a careful Review may be found to be necessary will by exerting his Endeavours for that End perform for his Country a most acceptable Service and endear his Memory to latest Posterity  A BILL FOR Comprehending and reducing into one Act of Parliament the several Laws now in Force relating to the Highways within that Part of  Great Britain  called  England  WHEREAS the necessary Intercourse between the trading and other Towns Parishes and Places within this Kingdom is greatly obstructed by the Badness of such of the Highways as
