 DIBDIN'S HISTORY OF THE STAGE  A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE STAGE  WRITTEN BY MR DIBDIN  THE PLAYERS CANNOT KEEP COUNSEL THEY'LL TELL ALL  VOL II  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY HIM AT HIS WAREHOUSE LEICESTER PLACE LEICESTER SQUARE  THE STAGE  BOOK III THE FRENCH THEATRE UP TO THE DEATH OF VOLTAIRE  CHAP I THE ORIGIN OF OPERA AND ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN FRANCE  WE shall now find the affairs of the French theatre so blended with the serious and comic opera and a variety of spectacles branching from those exhibitions that it will be necessary to give an account of their establishment in FRANCE to make this description of the drama in that country complete and as it cannot be denied that music taken as an embellishment excites and satisfies curiosity in a more gratifying and delightful manner than any other dramatic amusement I shall beg the reader's patience for a few pages while I speak of that bewitching art in order to shew how opera originated  and in what manner it established itself in FRANCE and other countries  It is impossible to trace the origin of music considered as a science In its literal and extended idea which the ancients distinguished by the term Harmonica it was born with the world The more we search either into holy writ or into mythology the more we shall be convinced that music made up the delight of all countries at all times  So early as the fourth chapter of Genesis we find JUBAL who we are told was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ and if we go into mythology have we not APOLLO the muses and the music of the spheres  nay that it was the sort of order that lent perfection to the chaos in which other sciences were involved and that was the reason perhaps the ancients gave to every art the appellation music  The Egyptians inform us that music was invented immediately after the flood and the idea of instruments which naturally implies harmony are by inumerable authors said to have been of very early invention MERCURY we are told found a tortoise shell and stretching cords across it formed the lyre LUCRETIUS says that wind instruments had their origin from the whistling of the wind among the rushes AMPHION CHIRON DEMODOCUS  HERMES TRISMEGISTUS OLYMPUS and ORPHEUS are all reported to have been celebrated musicians and performers on musical instruments nay to what perfection must this art have been brought at the time of the Grecian republic if it be true that TERPANDER set the laws of LYCURGUS to music that he was well acquainted with the modes and that THALES and THAMYRUS knew the nature of instrumental music without singing  But the more we search into this exquisite and endless theme the more we shall be bewildered with conjecture though facts stare us in the face A host of writers on one side contend that the ancients alone knew how to render music facinating and that the degree of perfection from which it derived that power to which ORPHEUS and others had brought it is lost to the moderns others contend that the ancients knew nothing of harmony and one of them insists that what is called harmony or the doctrine of combined sounds was invented by GUIDO ARETINE a benedictine friar  Let us examine this The ancients had instruments and to talk of instruments without the idea of combined sounds is ridiculous and contemptible It would be pedantry and perhaps impertinence here to speak particularly of twelve or fourteen  stringed instruments among the ancients which were struck either with the hand or a plectrum of six or seven wind instruments particularly the hydraulic organ the very title of which explains the ingenuity of its construction and as many pulsatile instruments it is enough to say that we know these instruments were at that time in use and therefore that harmony to its fullest extent must have been known for no one will be so absurd as to suppose that this great variety of instruments were played on one at a time but if it had been so does not every stringed instrument answer all the purposes of harmony  Every adventitious accident from whence proceeds successive sounds even the creaking of a door produces the effect of a chord and therefore leads to combined sounds Two unconscious watchmen shall cry the same hour in thirds but this is obvious in a thousand instances and as to measure the marching of soldiers the ringing of bells the forging an anchor and the galloping of an horse will give you all the varieties of common and tripple time The words  " From harmony from heavenly harmony  " The universal frame began"  came from the truly lyric soul of DRYDEN and a lovely and a delicious truth it is The divine and  exquisite beauty of order is music of which melody is like the sun that cheers the universe and harmony like creation itself that exults and rejoices under its celestial influence  If it be meant as some warmly contend that the ancients in their choruses had but one song and though there were a variety of voices each distinct voice sung the same individual melody it does not alter the case Did the lyre the psalterium the tibia the cornuus the tympanum the tintinnabulum did these join the voices in playing the same song the same individual melody 'Tis impossible Some of these instruments out of many others then in use were incapable of it their contracted scale would not admit of it No it was an accompanyment a dress to adorn the melody which like the decoration of beauty by disguising some parts gave to those that were discerned a superior degree of loveliness  I'll put this fact in an incontrovertible light A large congregation shall sing the hundreth Psalm and though there is the difference of an octave in the voices of men from the voices of women and children yet they will sing the same distinct individual melody and a most delightful melody it is What follows They are accompanied by an organ  which combines all those harmonious principles we have been speaking of the full organ even to abstruseness What does it signify then whether the voices sing the same melody or sing in parts By the introduction of this accompanyment is not the concert full and complete And this admitted who shall say that the ancients were strangers to harmony in music  I should think it very probable that their music was like their writings grand natural and impressive and if so by using less complication they delighted not surprized the mind and therefore the simplicity of their harmony by answering all the best purposes of music surpassed the inexplicable and distracting system of modern harmonists  These and a thousand other reasons incline us to believe that dramatic entertainments were invented through the medium of music Dithyrambics were as we have seen actually sung by one person and we may go further and say that HOMER HESIOD and all the ancient poets sung their songs of what nature soever for the amusement of the public  HESIOD by way of an instrument used to accompany his voice with a switch or bundle of rods which by being smartly twitched with the hand produced a sort of whistling sound I think this instrument might be applied to some of our modern singers with very good effect    This admitted something as much in the nature of opera as other dramatic entertainments were in the nature of plays certainly made at all times a part of the amusements of the theatre and that sostenuto for which LULLY has been so greatly admired and which I dare say was dull enough was clearly that sustained sleepy declamatory effect so often complained of in the choruses of the ancients  Opera however being in its capability more extraneous and less natural as a vehicle to convey regular and probable action was longer than any other species of dramatic production before it took a tone and a form so as to be classed separately and distinct from other stage representations and it is very probable though the regular opera had often been attempted it never would have become any thing more than a vehicle for the introduction of dances and decorations had it not found a sort of AESCHYLUS in METATASIO  JOHANNES SULPITIUS a native of VEROLI is said to have exhibited operas in the fifteenth century and we are told that EMILIO CAVALIERE in exhibited two dramas set to music in the Palace of the Grand Duke of FLORENCE We hear also of OCTAVIO RINUCCINI who brought an opera on the theatre at FLORENCE in in  honour of the marriage of MARY de MEDICIS with HENRY the fourth of FRANCE  We have seen by VOLTAIRE's account how opera came to be introduced into FRANCE I shall therefore now proceed to relate some particulars of LULLY who presided so long at the head of that entertainment LULLY was born at FLORENCE in and died in PARIS in Being an excellent performer on the violin he was invited to FRANCE where he became superintendant of the king's band and by address and cunning soon introduced himself into all companies His will was a fiat not only as to music but almost as to every thing else though he was very little more than an arrogant pretending buffoon  A French writer under the idea of a letter received from the Elysian Fields gives the following description of LULLY Upon a sort of litter composed of ordure and rotten laurels appeared carried by twelve satyrs a little slovenly ill looking man He had small red eyes which could scarcely be seen and out of which he could scarcely see They emitted however a sort of cloudy fire in which could be discovered a mixture of shrewdness and malignity His exterior was all gaiety but it was perpetually checked with inward inquietude To servility bussoonery and obscenity he joined arrogance pride and presumption and I was not astonished upon enquiring who this pussed up manikin could be to learn that he was nothing more than a drunken fidler    In speaking of the opera it will be generally  necessary to associate the names of QUINAULT and LULLY In they brought out  Cadmus  which was performed  au Jeu de paulme de Bel Air  but LULLY ever attentive to his interest no sooner heard of MOLIERE's death than he set every engine to work to procure a grant from the king of MOLIERE's theatre This with very little difficulty he obtained and  Cadmus  was the first opera brought out on the theatre of the Palais Royal  Thus there had been three regular theatresone at the  Hotel de Bourgogne  one at  Du Marais  and one at the  Palais Royal  and they continued to perform upon separate foundations until the death of MOLIERE which happened in February This company who could not support themselves after the death of their chief divided and by incorporating themselves into the other two companies gave them great additional strength The theatre  au Marais  soon afterwards quitted that situation and opened a new house in  La Rue Mazarine  where the king sent all the scenes and decorations which MOLIERE had used in the  Palais Royal  being situated opposite  la rue Guenegaud  This house was callad the theatre  de Guenegaud  On the twentyfirst of October however the king united the two companies fixed himself the number of actors allotted their different shares of the profits according to their respective merits discharged some gave others pensions and regulated the whole economy of this new society who were besides gratified out of his privy purse with a pension of twelve thousand livres  though some contend that  Alceste  was the first which appeared in This however is not probable or if it were it is hardly worth enquiring into  Thesée  came out in and on the following  year  Atys  one of the most celebrated operas of these associates in which there is certainly some beautiful lyric writing  LOUIS the fourteenth asked Madame MAINTENON which of all the operas she liked best She answered  Atys  "  Atys  Madam"  said he  "is too happy"  This piece had astonishing success It was however according to custom bitterly attacked by DESPREAUX of whose judgment as a critic I cannot give a better proof than that which follows When this satyrist went to the representation of this opera at VERSAILLES  "put me"  said he  "in some corner where it will be impossible for me to hear the words I admire the music of LULLY but I have a sovereign contempt for the verses of QUINAULT  Incomparable critic Admire music composed on purpose to give force and expression to those words which he held in contempt    Isis  followed  Atys  in and  Proserpine  in but  Persée  which came out in was one of the most famous operas produced by these allies CORNEILLE however had treated the same subject in a piece called  Andromede  A number of fortunate circumstances combined to assist the success of this piece Among the rest the audience were most agreeably surprised to see the young prince DEITRICHTEIN the eldest son of the prince of that name grand master of his imperial majesty dance  with an elegance and a grace which gave universal astonishment He appeared on the theatre masked as was then the custom and took alternately the situation of all the principal dancers  The concourse of people who slocked to see this prince was incredible and what renders the circumstance still more wonderful is that though he excelled every other dancer he had not been taught more than a year  The king had this opera performed in an  orangerie  where the disposition of real trees a fountain and other natural objects curiously and judiciously arranged gave a most delicious effect to the spectacle  All the beauties of the court were invited and every possible care taken and expence lavished to shew the merit of the poet and composer to advantage all which merit LULLY as usual took to himself and received the compliments of the king and the nobility while the humble QUINAULT stood at a distance as little noticed as if he had been an indifferent spectator The words of the king to LULLY were  "that he had never seen a piece where the music was so equally good throughout"  The very same year a brilliant  fete  was given to celebrate the birth of the Duke of BURGUNDY LULLY upon this occasion gave  Perseus  gratis and prevailed upon QUINAULT to introduce a great deal of novelty applicable to the event in honour of which the opera was performed besides which he put himself to a prodigious expence He had a triumphal arch a firework and a fixed sun of an astonishing magnitude containing several thousand lamps after which there was a discharge of musketry and to finish all a fountain that ran with wine Who after this could deny that  Perseus  was the sole production of LULLY  Nor were these adventitious circumstances all that gave advantage to  Perseus  it begat a spirited controversy which the ladies very warmly entered into and insisted that  Pheneus's  expression that he would rather see ANDROMEDA devoured by the monster than in the arms of his rival was void of gallantry and therefore ought not to be uttered on the stage  This dispute was so followed up that all the public prints of the times were full of it No wonder then that an opera so much praised and condemned should be the constant topic and that therefore either through prejudice or partialitymotives  equally advantageousall PARIS made a point of attending it  After  Persée  came  Phaeton  in  Amadis de Gaule  in  Le Temple de la Paix  in  Roland  also in and  Armide  in Immediately after the production of this last opera QUINAULT heartily tired of LULLY retired from the theatre  It may truly be said that though the enthusiasm caused by the music of LULLY arose from no other reason than that music had till that time in FRANCE been of the most contemptible kind yet he merits a large share of praise for reducing it to a sort of slandard which proved a good ground work for the improvements afterwards made in it by RAMEAU and others But none of this would have been effected had not QUINAULT started up the only French poet in spight of the ill nature and the ignorance of BOILEAU who possessed a true genius for this species of lyric poetry  These men led very different lives and while QUINAULT lived honoured and respected and died lamented and regretted LULLY was laughed at and despised in his life time and detested and execrated after his death  The death of LULLY was caused by an accident He composed a  Te Deum  on the recovery of the king and in the heighth of his enthusiasm beating time very violently with his cane he struck it forcibly against his foot and his frame being at all times from his debaucheries in a corrupt and diseased state a gangrene ensued which carried him off  Among other instances of LULLY's total want of principle and morality we are told that fancying himself in extremity he sent for a confessor who informed him he had no chance of being saved unless he threw his last opera in the fire This he instantly complied with but getting apparently better and being reproached by one of the princes who came to see him with having burnt his opera  "Oh"  said he  "I was not such a fool in that business as you imagine I knew what I was about I have a copy and so the priest was cheated"  He grew worse however and finding his death approach he not only burnt his reserved copy but submitted himself to be laid upon a heap of ashes with a halter round his neck and to expiate his offence as he imagined sung to one of his own airs these words  "  Il faut mourir pecheur Il faut mourir  "  While he was ill the Chevalier de LORRAINE came to see him and in an affectionate way lamented his situation and made him a thousand protestations of friendship Oh yes truly said the wife of LULLY you are a very kind friend to him It was you who made him drunk the last and will be the cause of his death  "Hold your tongue"  said LULLY  "'tis very kind of the Chevalier He was the last that made me drunk and in return he shall be the first that I'll make drunk if I escape this illness"    Among the operas of QUINAULT and LULLY it was said that  Atys  was the opera for the king  Armide  for the ladies  Phaeton  for the public in general and  Isis  for musicians  Many other operas written by QUINAULT and composed by LULLY were performed with various  success  LULLY the father having had such success LULLY the son attempted to profit by the family reputationFinding however no QUINAULT who would permit him to spoil his pieces the only opera he ever attempted which was called  Orpheus  and written by BOULAY drew on him in derision an epigram a rondeau and a song for he had such influence that the audience were forbid by the court to hiss therefore they were obliged to damn  Orpheus  through the medium of the newspapers  At length many of the best authors adventured in this species of writing and MOLIERE QUINAULT PIERRE and T CORNEILLE wrote  Psyche  in conjunction and there is another  Psyche  which has been pretty generally given to FONTENELLE At length when the opera became more established and RAMEAU was the favourite composer  RAMEAU found it very difficult to establish a musical reputation The French had been so used to the monotony of LULLY that they had no relish for the diversity of RAMEAU Thus it happened that he was obliged to compose what words he could get One of his first attempts was an opera by an anonymous author called  Paladins  One of the songs was set to such quick music that the words could not be heardThe singer complained of this RAMEAU replied he did it out of kindness to the author for that in rendering the words unintelligible he had acted towards him with the greatest friendship  the best geniuses wrote for that spectacle nay even VOLTAIRE was tempted to adventure in it and thereby undertook what he himself confesses he did not understand His  Temple de Gloire  an entertainment of this kind not succeeding he asked an Abbe of his acquaintance how he liked it The Abbe answered  he had been at the temple of glory but the lady did not happen to be at home  In answer to a friend whose sentiments were something similar to the above VOLTAIRE says  "I see I have done a very foolish thing in writing an opera but the pleasure of working for such a man as RAMEAU hurried me out of all prudence In considering the extent of his genius I forgot how much my own was circumscribed for I now find if I have any it is not calculated for the lyric style and I plainly see I could write an epic poem with more ease than I could  fill a canvass  Not that I by any means hold this art in contempt on the contrary I hold it to be a very respectable species of writing but I now fairly see that I shall never have a talent for it"  CHAP II ITALIAN THEATRE  AS the Italian theatre as it always has been called will hereafter make up a considerable part of French dramatic exhibitions it will be extremely proper in in this place to give some account of it and also of all those inferior dramatic objects which branched out from that strange heterogeneous amusement which like our opera was originally performed in a language the natives did not understand Nay till very lately the love scenes in some of those comedies have been occasionally performed in Italian In a troop of Italian comedians called  Le Gelosi  performed at the  Hotel de Bourbon  but they had no fixed establishment and after some years they were replaced by another who in their turn were suppressed in It was after this that an Italian troop were permitted to perform alternately with the troop of MOLIERE  au petit Bourbon  where they continued till when the king thought proper to shut up their theatre  The variety of difficulties the Italian comedians laboured under to procure leave for their performances obliged them to exhaust invention for expedients to combat the laws then in force The first of these expedients was an attempt to evade an accusation of performing regular pieces This they effected by taking an outline of the plot of the piece together with all the nicer immediate circumstances and having got this perfectly by heart to supply the dialogue extempore By this means the same scene was never literally performed twice alike especially as they frequently changed parts with each other  These pieces were the invention of the two RICOBONIES father and son and to say truth they possessed one very extraordinary merit The words coming from the actors extemporaneously they had a vivacity a glow a fire unknown to those dialogues which are studied This however was not new for it had been done in Spain The comedians who composed this troop were almost all authors and through a lively and fertile imagination they filled their parts with uncommon eclat The contrary however was too often the case for it is easily seen that a single novice might disconcert the most ingenious essusions of imagination    Notwithstanding this and other expedients the Italian theatre was shut up for nineteen years and after this they were so dispersed that it was not expected they would ever again rally in FRANCE The Duc D'ORLEANS however at that time  Regent sent for others who arrived in PARIS in He gave instructions to M ROUILLE  Counseiller d'Etat  to procure the best performers from ITALY It will easily be believed the task was not difficult Indeed with such alacrity did they pour in from all quarters that the company was very soon complete and the regent till the  Hotel de Bourgogne  could be got ready permitted them to perform at the  Palais Royal  on such days as there was no opera  On the eighteenth of May they opened their theatre with a piece called  L'Heureuse Surprize  and on the twentieth of the same month their establishment was announced by an order from the king The first day of the following June they took possession of the theatre of the  Hotel de Bourgogne  under the title of the comedians in ordinary to his Royal Highness Monsieigneur le Duc D'ORLEANS Regent and that prince dying on the second of December the company obtained the title of the KING's  Italian comedians in ordinary  with a pension of fifteen thousand livres This obtained they put the king's arms upon the  Hotel de Bourgogne  and above it in black marble this inscription in letters of gold  HOTEL  des comediens Italiens ordinaires du Roi  entretenus par sa Majésté rétablis a Paris en l'annee  MDCCXVI  The theatres that were erected at the Fairs  St Germain  and  St Laurent  though an inferior kind were nevertheless productive of great improvement in dramatic humour and also bringing forward actors and actresses of great and particular merit English travellers at that time flocked with pleasure to see the buffoon and grotesque acting of DOMINIQUE in  Harlequin  the simple and  naive  deportment of BELLONI in  Pierrot  the humour and  finesse  of Madamoiselle de LISLE in the waiting maids the pleasant awkwardness of DESGRANGES in  Scaramouch  the singular figure of PAGHETTI in old men and the noble and modest air of Madamoiselle MOLIN in the characters of wards and daughters  In all countries the best writers have been at different times ill treated by managers LE SAGE D'ORNEVAL PANNARD PIRON and BOISSY led the way for almost a total desertion of the theatre in favour of the fair which boasted at length the added names of FAVARD ANSEAUME DOMINIQUE LE GRAND FAGAN DELAFOND PONTAU VADE and SEDAINE The trifles they produced being excellent in their kind and in a style perfectly different from the general run of dramatic  entertainments and also produced by some of the best writers made the fairs for forty years the first object of amusement in FRANCE  The theatres feeling severely the effect of their own inferiority were obliged to have recourse to a number of expedients if not to suppress the pieces performed at the fair at least to lessen their value For this purpose they were perpetually teasing the magistrates who at different times upon being properly applied to issued several mandates to forbid such parts of the performances as were most likely to be applauded  Upon one of these occasions music was absolutely forbidden in consequence of this they were obliged to supply what they could in which they were generally by implication pretty severe on their oppressors One night in the middle of a scene an ass was heard to bray  "Hold your tongue"  said Harlequin  "you'll bring us into a scrape Don't you know we are forbid to have music"    This only served to stimulate their exertions and to rouse them to fresh ingenuity Being forbidden to perform in dialogue they were for some short time reduced to exhibit every thing by gesture through which they severely and successfully ridiculed their enemies They could not hope however to perform long in this manner to any great advantage and therefore applied to the sydnies  and the doctors of the royal academy of musicians who permitted them to perform short pieces partly dialogue and partly songs and occasionally assisted by dancesThese spectacles were called the Comic Opera of which species of amusement the admirable author of  Gil Blas  may be considered as the father  Flattered with the great success he had met with on the stage and irritated with the avarice and folly of the managers he devoted himself entirely to this slighter species of dramatic employment Many of his pieces were in great measure written from motives of revenge and such were generally parodies of the new tragedies which no sooner appeared on the theatre than they were humourously and successfully ridiculed at the fair The best authors smarted and most severely too under this teasing rod of criticism Among the rest Mr VOLTAIRE in the business of his  Semiramis  certainly felt it with the greatest keenness  VOLTAIRE was distressed beyond measure lest his  Semiramis  should be parodied He wrote a letter to the queen where he says  "as he is sure she has no farther intention in sanctioning the stage by her august presence than to countenance only decency and decorum he conjures her with the most  lively grief  not to suffer a violation of decency in permitting a satire against him That the tragedy of  Semiramis  is founded from one end to the other upon a subject the most pure and moral and from that circumstance it demands her protection Deign"  says he  "to consider that I am the king's domestic and consequently yours My colleagues who are gentlemen in ordinary to the king of whom many are employed in other courts and many possess the most honourable situations will find themselves disgraced by this insult and will deprive me of my charge and humble me in the eyes of the royal family if I am forced to submit to this cruel humiliation I conjure your majesty by your goodness of heart by the greatness and liberality of your mind by your piety not to deliver me thus to my hidden and overt enemies who after loading me with a thousand opprobrious outrages would destroy me by making me a public laughing stock  "Deign to consider that these parodies have been long since legally forbidden Must they then be revived solely to my inj  y and will your majesty suffer it No Madam your heart is two just not to be moved by my wretchedness and my prayers not will you suffer an old servant to die with grief and shame  hope then your humanity will be touched with my sorrowful case and as in painting you I paint virtue itself let me hope that v  rtue will be my protection"  Without a comment I give this as genuine from VOLTAIRE who pretended to laugh at the malice of all the world    These comic writers however drew on themselves by the severity of their satires a host of enemies and were forbid to perform any pieces in which there was either speaking or singing This only convinced the world that they were complete adepts in their business for immediately setting their wits to work they invented a species of amusement  which from its extraordinary novelty had the greatest success It was written in the strongest manner and thus performed  Two actors came on the stage with as many rolls of parchment as there were speeches in the scene they were to perform These rolls were numbered and on each written in large characters what they had to say These they alternately displayed which being read by the audience exhibited in very laconic terms some witty colloquy especially as these writings in great measure consisted of humorous apologies for their being under the necessity of having recourse to so incomplete an expedient  When the audience had seen enough of this visual dialogue large rolls of canvas were so displayed by two figures of boys who seemed playing in the air that the spectators could completely read the words of a song As soon as it became completely visible the orchestra began a well known air which some actor placed either in the  parterre  or the boxes began to sing The audience soon took the hint and after a time it was no uncommon thing for the whole of the spectators to join in every chorus  The matter was in proportion to the singularity  of the exigence most wonderfully managed but after all it is very evident that they laboured under the greatest disadvantages and at length by the e  ishment of the regular Italian comedians in  who were joined by some of the best perfo  mers at the fair this memorable era of humour and pleasantry on the French stage became apparently extract but it however left such traces of real humour fertile imagination and happy satire that there has been scarcely a comic opera written since in FRANCE that has not kept in view the species of intrigue invented by this extraordinary set of ingenious men  Even after the Italian theatre had been established in it laboured under difficulties for growing into fashion the French actors complained that the Italians should perform in any other than their own language This complaint was carried to the king who desired to hear both parties BARON in the name of the French actors spoke first This done the king made a sign to DOMINIQUE the Harlequin to speak in his turn  "In what language may it please your majesty am I to speak"  said DOMINIQUE  "In any language you will"  said the king  "Oh"  said the Harlequin  "if that's the case I have won my cause"  The king would not recal his word and after that time the Italians continued to perform without interruption    Before we quit the subject of the fair it is proper to say it began with puppets After this appeared wild beasts but it is curious to remark that a lion or a tiger was not considered as the smallest  rarity if he could not perform some comical tricks After these came giants who must also be buffoons otherwise they had no attention paid them On this account the common animals which we see every day were the greatest favourites Dogs cats and monkies did more than the best actors and actresses that ever appeared and these for a time were put out of countenance by slightofhand men tumblers and ropedancers  It must however be remembered to the honour of the fair that it gave birth to the most elegant dancing in FRANCE Madmoiselle de LISLE who joined the most refined taste and execution in serious dancing to the most charming sprightliness in demicharacter and the strongest conception and discrimination in dances of character and expression may be reckoned among the earliest proofs that the French were born eminently to rival all other nations in that accomplishedI will not however here say how far usefulart  Madmoiselle SALLE who caused so long the admiration of PARIS and at length retired with the applause of her country was also an  Eleve  at the fair Madmoiselle RABON that very celebrated dancer was also bred up at the fair and as for singers it was the nursery of the theatre  Among other dancers who performed with great celebrity at the fair was the father of our famous GRIMALDI He had then just fled from ITALY He was called for distinction  Iron Legs  and supposed to be the best jumper in the world for even the taste of FRANCE in its own proper profession has been at times vitiated He once jumped so high that he broke a chandelier a piece of which hitting the Turkish ambassador who was in the stage box he considered this conduct as a premeditated affront and complained to the French court of the outrage But the most extraordinary circumstance concerning him was his being put in prison for indecency on the FRENCH STAGE which is a circumstance when we consider the licence used there most peculiarly extraordinary  The French were certainly for a time insatuated with GRIMALDI but after the unlucky business of his imprisonment for indecency  I copy the following circumstance from a French author  "Iron Legs had for a partner either his wife his sister or his daughter for so equivocal was the lady's character that no one has been able to ascertain the precise degree of relationship This nymph was thought to be his sister or daughter for she was remarkably like him being a squat thick strong figure and endowed with so much agility and strength that she could break chandeliers almost as well as himself Thus as it was well known she cohabited with him as his wife the remainder of the conjecturehis character being pretty well authenticatedbecame more probable"  he began  to lose ground and at length was obliged to stroll into FLANDERS where however he proved a source of riches to his confederates for the Flanderkins as he added legerdemain and other tricks to his jumping thought him some supernatural being  When GRIMALDI was obliged to decamp into FLANDERS he and his troop were attacked near BRUSSELS by a banditti The baggage waggon was ransacked their pockets turned inside out and according to their usual custom the thieves were about to dispatch their prey It should be known that GRIMALDI wanting money for his expedition enticed one FLAHAUT a bookseller to follow his fortunes FLAHAUT having learnt Latin took it into his head that it would be a good thing to introduce the ancient chorus on the stage by way of explaining GRIMALDI's dances GRIMALDI appeared to approve the scheme but told him as it was a kind of improvement that could only be brought about by degrees he had better learn to dance first which would make him immediately useful FLAHAUT set to work and GRIMALDI promised to make him a capital dancer In the end he got as much money together as he could left his family and as I said followed GRIMALDI When the fabres of the banditti were drawn to dispatch the troop of dancers GRIMALDI who at the danger of his life would have his joke whispered FLAHAUT to talk Latin to themThe enthusiast FLAHAUT began and for a few seconds the sabres were suspended Presently loudly vociferating  dixi  one of them aiming a blow at his head cried  feci  which blow had it taken place must have silenced the orator for ever But the most extraordinary part of the adventure remains to be told GRIMALDI's partner the lady before commemorated in all the furor of romantic heroism just as the word dispatch had been uttered stept forward and in a scream of despair implored the banditti to have pity on her comrades offering that if they would be merciful she would yield herself up a sacrifice and devote herself to their pleasure She described how many ways she could be useful to them that she could dance to amuse them she could cook for them and to be brief intimated in the language of DEBORAH WOODCOCK that she had no objection to any work they could put her to In short the thieves were appeased and carried off the lady in triumph but not till they had stript the whole troop stark naked leaving them nothing but the refuse of what they had pillaged from baggage waggon consisting of a few odds and ends of pantomime dresses GRIMALDI put on an old Harlequin's jacket poor FLAHAUT contented himself with the trowsers of Scaramouch and in this plight they begged their way to BRUSSELS    I have said that the regular Italian comedy was reestablished in Such an impression however the performances at the fair made that the Italians on their return were for a time obliged to perform on that very spot in order to give an original colour to their representations and thus by degrees they stole on the notice of the public who such is the force of custom relished those amusements no where but at the place they were originally given  The circumstance of performing the pieces of the fair arose from this When first this troop began to be established at PARIS they performed nothing but pieces entirely Italian The ladies who  did not understand that language no longer frequented the theatre The gentlemen finding themselves deserted by the ladies and thus the great channel of gallantry stagnated also kept away Seeing this the Italians had recourse to the pieces anciently performed at the Italian theatre which were a jumble of half Italian and half French What had formerly pleased however was no longer relished and they were at one time upon the point of returning to ITALY What follows is the substance of a speech spoken by Harlequin to the audience  "Ladies and Gentlemen they make me play all sorts of parts and I know many of them ought to disgust you I hope however that which I attempt at present will have the contrary effect though I confess a Harlequin may be expected to move your laughter rather than your pity But novelty does much on the stage and I trust when you see a kneeling Scaramouch a weeping Colombine and an imploring Pantaloon you will forget their assumed characters and consider them as so many strangers appealing to your compassion  "You will be pleased to take into your consideration that in coming to FRANCE we had to  combat new manners a new language and a new species of entertainment In short we have only yet been at school and the public have very properly kept away from us till we made ourselves perfect The ladies without whom the best eloquence languishes and dies have withdrawn from us their support and how can we expect any men of gallantry to attend us  "The pieces we have performed were tasted formerly but it was folly to suppose that what delighted a barbarous age should please an enlightened one We mean therefore to abandon them to substitute others more to your taste and as the public are always equitable we fear not your indulgence so much as our own inability What little merit we have shall be strenuously exerted to give you pleasure in the mean time we are producing every day in our children young actors and actresses who though they inherit Italian abilities are yet natives of FRANCE and may perfect the celebrity of the theatre all which advantages would be lost if we were compelled to go to our own country  "Deign therefore to consider at present our intentions that hereafter you may applaud our merits Hitherto you have been indulgent at  the expence of your justice hereafter we slatter ourselves that applause will be sanctioned by propriety"  This speech had the desired effect the public interested themselves in the affairs of the comedians and some of the best authors having advised them to perform the most celebrated among the pieces given at the fair they very soon got into reputation At length many writers of eminence lent their assistance and their children as they had predicted grew up and were most accomplished actors Indeed the reputation of the Italian theatre eclipsed that of the French to which St FOIX MARIVAUX and other eminent authors did not a little contribute  A circumstance which happened about this time went a great way towards establishing the reputation of the Italian theatre at PARIS The convalescence of the king after a dangerous illness gave occasion for every exertion of loyalty throughout the kingdom but the spirit of the Italians was very remarkable they erected a most magnificent transparency before the  Facade  of their theatre they built up a temporary stage on the balcony over it whence their band did not cease to play or their troop to dance during the greatest part of the night and as the whole tendency of their performance was to compliment  the king and congratulate the people on his recovery as many as could be collected on the spot joined their shouts of  Vive le Roi  in time to the music as often as it was introduced and that their mirth might not want an incentive cisterns of wine were placed in a convenient manner to supply the populace  On the day that  Te Deum  was sung at  Notre Dame  the Italians recommenced the rejoicings The transparency erected before their theatre was so masterly both in conception and execution that it is really worthy of particular descriptionWithin a circular decoration consisting of symbolical ornaments was painted the temple of IRIS surrounded with a beautiful rainbow on which appeared the goddess with all her attributes  The illuminations which accompanied this grand picture formed three arcades supported by pilasters all of the rustic order Between the arcades  Vive le Roi  was suspended in large characters Above the pilasters were placed four pyramids ornamented with streams of fire  This was effected by rows of lamps placed before reverberators  which gave an unspeakable effect The inside of the temple was entirely transparent  and nobly designed as well as the rainbow and the figure of IRIS  In the middle of the temple was placed a portrait of the king under a figure of APOLLO surrounded with his ordinary symbols Over his head the words POST NUBILA PHOEBUS and on the two sides of APOLLO were the figures of Peace and Plenty From the extremity of the erection were carried two pyramids which completed the grandeur of the whole to a degree of wonder they were of themselves fiftytwo feet high and at the base fifty feet wide tapering as they ascended to a point  To enumerate all the prodigious variety of devices which were contained in the paintings on the pyramids would take up much more room than I ought to allow It is enough to say that they were all transparent and distributed about in the most fanciful and charming order being interlaced with innumerable lamps placed before reverberators To the BRUNETTIS father and son famous Italian painters was confided the execution of the whole who had now brought scenery in FRANCE to that perfection which has ever since made it the admiration of all other nations  These comedians also gave upon these occasions  three new pieces called the  Illumination  the  Village Wedding  and the  Sincere Revels  They were written by PANNARD and performed with all the success that could be expected from an event so naturally interesting From this circumstance it happened that the king was ever after called LOUIS  le bien aime  those words being a quotation from a speech in one of the pieces  CHAP III ACTORS  ANCIENTLY in FRANCE we have seen that all the authors were actors The Trouverres the Troubadours the Pilgrims and even the Priests pesonated different characters and we find them at the head of their respective companies acting singing or posturing according to the nature of the spectacle they undertook to exhibit In the  Mysteries  the  Confraternity of the Passion  were all actors When the  Mysteries  had yielded to the  Moralists  the performers were partly the priests and partly the laiety By the time the  Children of Sans Souci  joined this confedracy and they were forbid to perform any other than profane subjects that had a moral tendency the priests retired from the stage and the laiety had exclusive possession of it  The retirement of the priests seemed to be the signal for improvement The tragedies of JODELLE and the rest must have boasted much more regular actors than the rhapsodies that preceded them declamation  however was all that yet could be expected It should seem indeed that till then the employment of an actor had never been considered as a profession of itself for we are told and particularly by MAROT who died before JODELLE that a man whose epitaph he had written of the name of SERRE was the first regular actor  JODELLE did for MAROT what MAROT had done for SERRE He also published his works on a variety of subjects in  The epitaph written by JODELLE on MAROT is so neat that I shall transcribe it  Quercy La Cour Le Piemont L'Univers  Me fit me tint m'enterra me connut  Quercy mon los la Cour tout mon temps cut  Piemont a mes os L'Univers mes vers    As to women we have seen JODELLE obliged to personate his own  Cleopatra  and if credit can be given to the best French authorities a woman of the name of BEAUPRE was the first actress in FRANCE who might certainly have performed in the pieces written by HARDY but not earlier for she was very old and had retired from the stage before CORNEILLE brought out  Melite  She is reported to have said to CORNEILLE that times were changed for that before he wrote the pieces were miserable and the performers excellent but that since he had written the pieces were excellent and the performers miserable  We have the names of PONT ALAIS GRINGORE and others who must have been cotemporaries of SERRE for they are reported to have assisted in the  Mysteries  and being excellent buffoons they were perpetually quarrelling with the priests Instead of announcing their amusements by bills it was then the custom as we have formerly seen it in ENGLAND to beat a drum about the streets and these men having done so one day to the great annoyance of a priest who was preaching and who had a grudge against them he came out of the church and demanded how they came to be so audacious as to beat a drum while he was preaching  "I may as well ask you"  said PONT ALAIS  "how you came to be so audacious as to preach while I was beating my drum we are both following our occupations"  The priest however to shew who had the upper hand complained to the magistrates and the actor was imprisoned for six months  PONT ALAIS was hunchbacked and seeing a Cardinal one day in the street who was built upon the same principle he ran against him as if by accident After he had very humbly apologised for his carelessness  "I beg pardon of your excellence"  said he  "but you see two mountains may meet notwithstanding the proverb"    We have the names of other actors before HARDY but we know little of their merit During his time however at the head of a numerous company we find TURLUPIN GAUTHIER GARGUILLE HAUDOIN BONIFACE CAPITAINE and others  who are said to have been very celebrated but it should seem by this that the productions of HARDY which were generally called tragedies must have been full of buffoonery for TURLUPIN who from to was a principal performer in that company was a mere buffoon The word  turlupinade  taken from his name having been from that time to this incorporated into the French language as a term implying a filly jest  GARGUILLE succeeded TURLUPIN and HAUDOIN GARGUILLE exactly in the same steps The latter is said to have learnt so much of the jargon of physicians by performing doctors and apothecaries on the stage that he retired to MELUN without the smallest knowledge of physic but technical terms and there made a fortune in quality of physician  All this however seems to have been reformed when CORNEILLE began to write for the stage for notwithstanding the handsome compliment of Madame BEAUPRE and her predelection for the buffoonery just described which she was pleased facetiously to call good acting BELLEROSE the hero for whom CORNEILLE wrote and who about became manager of the company at the  Hotel de Bourgogne  gave so new and so natural a turn to dramatic representation both in tragedy and comedy  that followed up by CHEVALIER GUERON BRECOURT and others mummery and buffoonery soon gave way to truth and nature  BRECOURT had the misfortune to kill a coachman He retired into HOLLAND where he became an actor in a company belonging to the Prince of ORANGE but being informed that the court of FRANCE had applied to the court of HOLLAND to give up some person who had taken refuge in that country he suspected he might be the person meant and therefore returned and threw himself at the feet of the king reminding him that upon a former occasion he had probably saved his life by killing a wild boar that they had hunted Your majesty said he even did me the honour to ask if I was wounded The king smiled assured him he was not the man whose life he sought pardoned him and ordered MOLIERE to take him again into his company  To these succeeded MONTFLEURY LA FLEUR LA THUILLERIE MONDORY LA THORRILLIERE JODELET DU PARC and his wife CHAMPMELE and his wife RAISIN BEJART and his wife and daughter Madmoiselle DESCEILLETS BEAUCHATEAU and at length the great BARON who was called the French Roscius These and others of inferior rank made up the companies  Au Marais  at the  Hotel de Bourgogne  and the  Palais Royal    MONTFLEURY was a man of family and page to the Duke of GUISE He was held in great consideration by persons of rank The Cardinal de  RICHELIEU in particular undertook the care and expence of his wedding He had very brilliant abilities as an actor and we have already seen that his exertions cost him his life  MONTFLEURY considered his profession of an actor so honourable that when his marriage articles were preparing and he was desired being a man of family to describe in what manner he chose to be distinguished he answered that it was not in the power of ancestors to confer talents and that the most honourable title he desired to be known by was that of actor to the king    LA FLEUR who took the situation of MONTFLEURY after his death was an admirable actor and in a more extensive way than his predecessor He is reported to have been the first who possessed what the French call  des entrailles  that is to say the art of feeling to make others feel He married the daughter of an actor called GROS GUILLAUME and left a son who became a celebrated performer under the name of LA THUILLERIE  MONDORY a performer in tragedy sustained a respectable situation  au Marais  He was seized with an apoplexy as he was performing the part of  Herod  in the  Mariamne  of TRISTAN and survived but a few days  LA THORILLIERE was a man of family and was a captain in the cavalry but thought proper to  leave every other occupation to follow the profession of an actor He was remarkable for performing equally well the parts of kings and peasants He left behind him a son and a grandson both of whom were actors  JODELET was an admirable comic actor His features were so marked and so grotesque that whenever he appeared he excited loud bursts of laughter of which he seemed perfectly unconscious His humour was very peculiar and the authors to give force to their characters accommodated themselves to it Hence several of the pieces of that time were named after this actor witness  Jodelet Maitre et Valet Jodelet Souffleté  and others  DU PARC succeeded JODELET His success was at first doubtful though his merit was acknowledged but having performed an original part a kind of utterer of bon mots he hit upon a humour so whimfical that he became a great favourite He died the same year in which the world lost MOLIERE He had long however left the  Palais Royal  having followed his wife to the  Hotel de Bourgogne  as we have seen through the connivance of BOILEAU and RACINE  CHAMPMELE was a very mediocre performer  but he is celebrated if celebrity may be that way acquired for fathering other people's pieces and other people's children There were five or six pieces given to him which appeared in the works of others in particular  La Coupe Enchantee  and  Je vous prends sans Verd  both of which are among the productions of LA FONTAINE and  Delie  which was undoubtedly written by VISE but for the merit of these pieces FONTAINE might have been ashamed of his part and as to VISE it is no great matter whether he wrote  Delie  or not for he was as dull as CHAMPMELE  As to the other accommodating part of his character winking at his wife's infidelity who was an incomparable actress and a beautiful woman I can only say he deserves no pity for every man of that convenient description ought to have an unfaithful wife The lady is said to have dealt her favours pretty liberally We have seen RACINE in love with her and we are told that he was succeeded in her affections by the Count de CLERMONT TONNERRE This gave rise to an epigram which as it is impossible on account of the names to render with any effect into English I shall transcribe as it is  A la plus tendre amour elle fut destinee  Qui prit long tems RACINE duns son coeur  Mais par un insigne malheur  Le TONNERRE est venu qui l'  deracince  Madame CHAMPMELE is said to have been endowed with very extraordinary talents together with a most consummate knowledge of the world Her manners were uncommonly elegant and her conversation sweet and amiable Her house was the rendezvous for men of distinguished merit but it has been said by way of pleasantry that notwithstanding so much temptation except in the instance of her little slip with TONNERRE she was constant to DESPREAUX RACINE LA CHAPELLE VALINCOUR LA FONTAINE andher husband  It is said that CHAMPMELE meditated a singular revenge on his rivals which induced BOILEAU to write the following epigram  De six amans contens et non jaloux  Qui tour a tour servoient Madame CLAUDE  Le moins volage etoit JEAN son epoux  Un jour pourtant d'humeur un pen trop chaude  Serroit de pres sa servante aux yeux doux  Losqu'un des six lui dit que faites vous  Le jeu n'est sur avec cette Ribande  Ah voulezvous JEAN JEAN nous gater tous  CHAMPMELE we are told outlived his mother and his wife and soon afterwards died in the following extraordinary manner Coming out of the church of the Cordeliers where he had been to put up two requiems for his departed mother and wife the priest demanded the money CHAMPMELE gave him a piece of thirty sols the requiems being ten sols  a piece  "No"  said he  "keep that to pay for my requiem and instantly dropped down and expired"  RAISIN was an actor of infinite merit He was equal to any style of comedy He was called PROTEUS not more for his facility of changing from part to part than for the variety he threw into the part itself To these superior talents he united an excellent understanding and inexhaustible gaiety and good humour He was an admirable teller of a story and his company was coveted by all ranks a circumstance proving in him that talents are as dangerous as they are enviable for the pleasures he courted were the cause of his death  BEJART was himself but an indifferent actor but his wife was a woman of great theatrical talents and shrewd and penetrating judgement We have seen that MOLIERE when he left the  Illustrious  theatre to go into PROVINCE chose her for his guide in his theatrical conduct She having before been accustomed to regulate a country company Her attention to him and his interest was so much to his satisfaction that he married her daughter who under their instructions became a celebrated actress and an excellent singer  Some have endeavoured to sully her character and I am the more particular in mentioning this on account of having read an English history of MOLIERE where calumny is unsparingly dealt out on the head of this poor woman The French however do her justice not one of whom at least that I have seen and my perquisitions have been pretty industrious have hinted at any thing against her reputation It is true she married four or five years after the death of MOLIERE but her general conduct in his life time and the noble trait of duty tenderness and respect to his memory which we witnessed at the time of his funeral must in every candid mind acquit her of any infidelity towards a man whose alliance with her was a proud and enviable distinction and whose affectionate and friendly attention to her and her family was warm and unremitting throughout his life  Madmoiselle DESOEILLETS was an actress of considerable merit She was the original  Hermione  in RACINE's tragedy of  Andromache  and performed the part with wonderful force and energy CHAMPMELE however who came after her and who had more pathos and feeling succeeded so greatly that DESOEILLETS confessed herself conquered which being told to the king he said it was a mistake for that they both performed the part admirably but  to represent it to perfection DESOEILLETS ought to play the two first acts and CHAMPMELE the three last  BEAUCHATEAU was a respectable actor and had a son who gave promise of uncommon talents both as an author and a performer but at the age of fourteen he came to ENGLAND where he abjured the Roman Catholic religion and afterwards travelled into PERSIA and was never after heard of  It will be proper here to speak of BARON but to follow him through his career would lay me under the premature necessity of introducing POISSON D'ANCOURT and a number of other actors an account of whom had better come when we have examined those pieces in which they performed As BARON however was cotemporary with many of those who are mentioned in this chapter I shall speak of him previous to his quitting the theatre in when he retired with a pension of a thousand crowns  This performer is allowed infinitely to have surpassed all who had gone before him To strong natural conception he added a solid and decisive understanding his figure was noble his voice clear and powerful his deportment was graceful and majestic  his manner varied and accommodating and he never violated art unless to adorn nature  "The rules"  said he  "forbid us to list the hands above the head but if passion carries them there it is right nature knows better than the rules"  ROUSSEAU says that BARON gave new lustre to the beauties of RACINE and threw a veil over the defects of PRADON  BARON was certainly an actor of most extraordinary talents which he availed himself of every opportunity to ripen and perfect Bred up under the eye of MOLIERE it was impossible not to benefit materially by the admirable precepts of so excellent a master This added to those gifts with which by nature he had been abundantly endowed qualified him for every stile of acting and except in what we call low comedy a line he never attempted he was allowed eminently to excel all others  BARON wrote several pieces for the theatre which have a smartness and something very passable but nothing more His dialogue is lively and his scenes are varied and having mixed a good deal in society his characters are generally natural but they are rather sketches than plays traits than scenes and though taken abstractly they produced stage  effect yet their flimsyness and want of consequence rendered their success weak and their duration transitory  A French author says that the public never allow a man merit more than in one way and that though the writings of BARON ought to have ensured him reputation yet these meaner pretensions are so lost in the splendour of his talents as an actor that rather than be obliged to admire them they don't chuse to acknowledge them at all For my part I cannot see this though I must confess it is a doctrine that ever has been held for the more a man variously succeeds the more he must naturally be an object of public admiration and this is particularly noticeable in MOLIERE whose splendid talents as a writer have never lessened his reputation as an actor  I am afraid the friends of BARON have attempted to give him an overstrained reputation more suitable to his vanity which was insufferable than proportioned to his talents It was his common observation that every hundred years produces a CAESAR but that it takes two thousand to produce a ROSCIUS  BARON's coachman and laquais one day being very ill treated by the servants of the Marquis de BIRON he was determined to demand justice and for this purpose sought out the Marquis to whom he preferred his complaint  "  Monseigneur  "  said he  "  vos gens ont battu les miens je vous en demande justice  "  The Marquis a little piqued perhaps at the familiarity of  vos gens  and  les miens  answered him dryly  "  Mon pauvre Baron que veuxtu que je te dise Pourqoui astu des gens  "  BARON's father was an actor and his  mother an actress he had also a son of promising talents who died very young and though from the intermarriages of this family as will hereafter be seen many members of the theatre were produced he deservedly stood at the head of it and will ever be considered as a man of wonderful talents  CHAP IV FRENCH THEATRE TO THE DEATH OF RACINE  AT the time of MOLIERE's death and soon after of CORNEILLE's final secession from the stage RACINE ruled with almost undisputed sway in tragedy having no competitors worthy consideration except T CORNEILLE CAMPISTRON and BOURSAULT except we should mention FONTENELLE whose works for the theatre like those of LA FONTAINE were written more for amusement than professionly The vapid PRADON must be noticed merely for the sake of form  Comedy after the death of MOLIERE was almost wholly sustained by T CORNEILLE and BOURSAULT till in D'ANCOURT brought out his  Fonds Predues  D'ANCOURT whose name both as an author and an actor will by and by merit respectable notice was supposed to have injured his reputation by bringing out this piece RACINE called it in derision the scaffold of D'ANCOURT He however spoke truth by accident for it happened to be the scaffold on which he rose to build his reputation  so extremely difficult was it to  attain any thing like the standard MOLIERE had set up  As to the rincings of BOISROBERT's muddy hypocrene they had evaporated long before and long before had ceased the drolls of SCARRON which though admirable in their way were in common with a multitude of other mixed productions crushed by the powerful genius of MOLIERE BENSERADE had so injured himself by his disputes with this truly celebrated man that he thought it more prudent to write sonnets and epigrams and obtain patronage among the great than bring out plays and risk the decision of the public and as to BOYER's left handed fame it ought to be consigned to oblivion with the impertinent prattling of VISE who only made himself celebrated by censuring what he could not imitate CHAPELLE was just as much of a writer as a musical amateur is of a leader of a band and even LA FONTAINE deservedly celebrated as he ever will be and particularly for those writings which he so solemnly abjured  It is for the world to decide whether the conduct of LULLY or LA FONTAINE was in this instance replete with the grossest folly The intentions of the two men are out of the question and it is almost an insult to the memory of LA FONTAINE to couple his name with that musical buffoon LULLY's conduct in burning his opera in compliaisnce to the priest when he had a copy in his closet was full of knavery and impiety but LA FONTAINE could have no motive in abjuring the sentiments contained in his Tales but to expiate what he felt as a crime of no less magnitude than having corrupted the morals of youth and taken in that point of view surely nothing could be more meritorious He assembled the academy of which body he was a member and in their hearing and in that of a priest at the time he conceived himself near his end he execrated this incomparable book as an abominable work He begged pardon of GOD of the church of the academy and of all mankind for having published it and in particular for having a short time before retouched a new edition which had sold rapidly throughout EUROPE LA FONTAINE should have considered or if he was too modest the academy should have considered for him that neither the sentiments nor the circumstances were his own but that he had merely clothed old Tales from BOCACE and others in poetry so rare so neat and so winning that the French language had attained nothing equal to it before nor had it been to the time of this abjuration successfully imitated Query therefore though I hope I am no stickler for immorality whether reviving these old stories which had been so many years in the mouths of every nurse and midwife and I am afraid of every abbess and nun throughout the kingdom might not have been pardoned in favour of the advantage on the side of literature in general and poetry in particular especially as the French and above all the ladies have been ever remarkable not only for considering that wit as the most palatable as most calculated for the tierceness and poignancy of their language and that it would be prudery not openly to encourage which is the most highly seasoned with  double entendre  The fact is LA FONTAINE was in the season of sickness and M POUJET his confessor thought it the interest of the church that he should abjure not what had made the morals of the country worse than they were before for heaven knows that would have been at any time a difficult task but what had exposed the intrigues of religious professors  would  render the indispensible necessity of mentioning him here an irksome duty did it not give opportunity  of acknowledging his incomparable merit in every part of his productions except those written for the stage  I have already said of BOURSAULT that his comedies during the time of MOLIERE having been the offspring of feuds and controversies in which he was always conquered possessed considerable merit but were seldom interesting because they spent their force against the resistance opposed by this powerful competitor  Le Medecin Volant Le Mort Vivant  and  Les Cadenats  were of a description too weak to cope with those pieces of MOLIERE to which they were opposed but as if the existence of that father of comedy had been the enchantment which held the genius of BOURSAULT spellbound no sooner did that existence cease but like a spirit emancipated from confinement this author's merit began to be acknowledged of which truth as in many other instances it will be impossible for me in consequence of so much matter which will now press on me to mention more than some leading particulars  In BOURSAULT brought out  Le Mercure Galant  and  Germanicus  which last had before appeared under the title of  La Princesse des Cleves  The first of these pieces abounded with true comic humour and the other with harmony pathos and strength VISE  the author of a Journal called  Le Mercure Galant  who was triumphantly ridiculed in this comedy notwithstanding we have seen him formerly join BOURSAULT in ridiculing MOLIERE complained to the court against his old friend The court referred him to the General of the Police who said he could not find in his conscience to suppress the piece it was so entertaining but that to meet the matter half way he would issue a behest to call it  La Comedie sans Titre  in order that if it was not a just satire nobody might find it out  As to  Germanicus  it had prodigious success CORNEILLE in the academy spoke of it in the highest terms and said among other things that it wanted nothing but the name of RACINE to be considered as one of the best tragedies on the theatre This RACINE considered as a sarcasm and he therefore was never afterwards cordial with CORNEILLE  Marié Stuart Phaeton Meleagre Mots a la Mode Esope a la Ville  and  Esope a la Cour  make up the remainder of BOURSAULT's works which being written upon different occasions and for different purposes had of course various success The two  Aesops  are certainly not calculated for interesting effect being thronged with fabulous applications  the Fables however are written with great beauty point truth and interest and have ever been held in admiration though they have been over and over again attempted both here and in other countries with but indifferent effect on the stage  Esope a la Ville  nevertheless succeeded greatly during its first run which indeed in some measure was owing to the presence of mind of the celebrated RAISIN who performed the part of AESOP Finding that the audience began to tire at this perpetual repetition of fables though they greatly admired the fables themselves he came forward and told them that he plainly perceived among them tokens of discontent but the fact was that the author determined to bring AESOP on the stage would have failed in portraying the truth of his character if he had made him do any thing but repeat fables  "This character"  said he  "as all characters should be is drawn naturally and I can only tell you that if good fables which are generally considered as the essence of dramatic pieces should be deemed an imperfection in the piece before you we had better stop here for I have yet eleven or twelve fables to repeat and all as good as those you have heard"  The loudest and most universal applause succeeded and the piece from that moment was considered  as a work of great genius and a brilliant ornament to the theatre  Let us look after T CORNEILLE  Darius  brought out in  Le Geolier de soimeme  in  Le Galant Double  in and  Stilicon  in the same year had none of them more than passable success but in  Camma  which subject was suggested by FOUQUET and recommended by the great CORNEILLE to his brother when he returned to the theatre shews that fortune with T CORNEILLE was always in extremes for the  Hotel de Bourgogne  where it was represented was so thronged and that repeatedly both in the front and behind the scenes that there was scarcely room for the actors to perform their parts  The concourse of people who came to this tragedy induced the actors who had exhibited till then only on Sundays Tuesdays and Fridays to add Thursday to their nights of performance and this afterwards became a custom during the run of any piece that had extraordinary success  Pyrrhus  performed in  Maximien  in  Persée et Demetrius  in  Antiochus  in and  Le Baron  D'  Albikrac  in had each a creditable degree of success  Laodice  brought out the same  year did not succced so well  T CORNEILLE could not help expressing his astonishment that this play had so little success  "Why"  said he to a friend  "the scene lies in CAPPADOCIA and the manners of that people are pictured to the life"  "That's the reason perhaps"  answered the friend  "that it is not relished in FRANCE I'll tell you how to do Send it to CAPPADOCIA to be performed"    Annibal  in  La Comtesse  D'  Orgueil  in and  Theodat  in shared that sort of fate usually experienced by this author when fortune was not in her most generous mood  Ariane  produced in the same year though an indifferent piece was well received on account of the admirable acting of Madame CHAMPMELE and has frequently been revived since This is the play that induced BOILEAU to give T CORNEILLE the name of the Younger Brother CORNEILLE is said to have written this tragedy in seventeen days  Achille  in and  Don Caesar  D'  Avalos  in did tolerably well but this author determined to rouse the public had recourse in his next piece  Circe  which he brought forward in to machines and decorations This answered his expectations for the performance ran forty nights in succession and was freqently afterwards repeated during the season and CORNEILLE determined to strike while the iron was hot in the same year produced  L'Inconnu  a piece upon the same principle which had a prodigious number of representations of which the first thirty were at double price  Le Festin de Pierre  brought out in was nothing more than MOLIERE's comedy under that title put into verse and of course rendered more unnatural  Le Comte D'Essex  produced in was performed with success and has been often repeated  La Devinèresse  performed in and  Bradamante  in are all that now remain of the dramatic pieces written by T CORNEILLE He is said in  La Devinèresse  to have called in the assistance of VISE this is not very probable It was performed fortyseven successive times to prodigious houses  The subject of this comedy seems to have created its success It arose from a report that a woman of distinction had poisoned some of her relations to possess their fortune and Madam JOBIN the principal character in the piece recommends ludicrously this method of getting rich and for that purpose exposes to sale a medicine which the calls  La Pondre de Succession      This last was not one of those meteors which now and then burst forth to irradiate the reputation of this author not that it ought to be taken for granted that his productions of that description were his best  on the contrary they seem to have owed their fame principally to capriciousness a quality very apt to cherish what is superficial and pass over sterling merit  T CORNEILLE also wrote for the theatre two operas under the titles of  Psyche  and  Medee  neither of which had great success probably owing to LULLY Having lost QUINAULT the only poet who knew how to give advantage to his music the cloven foot appeared for with all his vaunting that his music had made QUINAULT a poet it fairly proved by his ill success after that writer's retirement that the beauty of QUINAULT's poetry had made LULLY a musician  I have been the more particular in this account of the works of T CORNEILLE because they are very frequently confounded with those of his brother an error that ought clearly to be pointed out There certainly was a wide distinction between the two men caused by the simple fact that the genius of the elder brother was infinitely superior to that of the younger If however the works of one may truly be called great those of the other may fairly claim the title of respectable and nothing can prove this more fully than his making head in the extraordinary way we have sometimes seen at the  time when his brother's brilliant success must have been a great obstacle to his reputation  Some of the beauties of the great CORNEILLE were strong conception grandeur of mind and true delineation of character T CORNEILLE could only boast conduct regularity and theatrical effect Hence the cause sometimes of sudden and unexpected success In other respects his pictures which were admirable on the side of design were faint on the side of colouring His diction is unequal and weak and only confirms the facility with which he laboured always a dangerous circumstance and that seldom permits an author to attain any thing beyond mediocrity unless through impulsive genius the mind be inspired with ideas so replete with truth and force that it may be said they are rather transmitted than written  CAMPISTRON a writer of respectable consideration next claims our attention He was born at TOULOUSE in and died of an apoplexy in CAMPISTRON was a nobleman by birth and to the happiest dispositions for a pursuit of literature received a most perfect and correct education His taste for poetry led him to PARIS where RACINE became his guide in his dramatic  career CAMPISTRON became the imitator of his preceptor but though he equalled him and sometimes excelled him in the conduct of his pieces he always fell short of the beauty of his versification  Owing to his birth his talent for poetry and the protection of the Duke de VENDÔME he possessed several considerable employments and was called on to fill a seat in the French Academy  It is extremely remarkable and very proper to be mentioned here that a single trait of private gratitude in CAMPISTRON laid the foundation of the elevated rank and splendid fortune of Cardinal ALBERONI CAMPISTRON as he made a tour through ITALY was wounded robbed and stripped near PARMA in an obscure village where ALBERONI was curate The charitable priest gave CAMPISTRON an asylum fed him cured him of his wounds cloathed him and did what he could to set him forward on his journey When CAMPISTRON sometime after attended the Duke of VENDOME to the wars in ITALY he drew his master insensibly towards the retreat of his preserver ALBERONI and knowing that he could materially serve the Duke by informing him where the country people concealed their corn of which article the army was in great need he had no doubt but the generosity of VENDOME would induce him liberally to reward ALBERONI and thus by being the instrument of his good fortune he should not only have an opportunity of rescuing a man of talents from obscurity but of giving a noble proof of his own gratitude by making such an ample return for the hospitality he had formerly received at his hands The sequel every body knows ALBERONI followed VENDOME to SPAIN and was there so useful that he was very soon entrusted with secrets of state and at length became first minister to the king of SPAIN    In he brought out his tragedy of  Virginie  which gave his name the stamp of reputation He closely allied himself with RAISIN the actor at whose house he lived in the continual society of all the men of talents and genius of that day so that he had the advantage of their united opinions before he produced any thing to the public  Arminius  came forward in At this time the French taste was guided by the caprice of Madame de BOUILLON who was considered as the arbiter of the public judgment She had taken a whim to patronize a very indifferent tragedy called  Teléphonte  written by CHAPELLE In consequence of this  Arminius  was thrust into a corner CAMPISTRON therefore withdrew his piece under the idea of improving it and having made a few immaterial alterations he dedicated it to Madame de BOUILLON after which time it was universally followed  Andronic  was brought out in the following year and had such prodigious success that for the first twenty nights the prices of admittance were doubled and when after that they had reduced them to their usual standard they were again obliged to double them for a considerable time and even then they  could scarcely keep the theatre clear enough to give the actors place for their performance  Alcibiade  performed also in had not the success of any of those pieces which preceded it CAMPISTRON was accused of having borrowed the subject from the  Themistocle  of DU RYER but this was not the truth or if it had been so it was not a sufficient reason for the coolness with which the public received it for the most celebrated authors have at all times taken the same liberties and whenever this has been done to advantage those productions have been uniformly considered as an additional value to the public stock of literature The real fact was that CAMPISTRON not having had sufficient time to prepare his play it came out in a more unfinished state than any of those the public had before seen  Phraate  produced in was so bold a picture of the times that CAMPISTRON roused all PARIS against him It was performed but three times and afterwards suppressed with all possible haste lest the incensed party should have had influence enough to send the author to the Bastile  Phocion  performed in had very indifferent success The public had not forgot  Phraate  This  induced CAMPISTRON to turn his mind to a subject which he thought would conciliate all parties He therefore in brought forward  Adrien  taken from the History of the Church but the public as little desirous of seeing religion on the stage as polities gave this christian tragedy as it was called a very heretical reception  CAMPISTRON however was determined to stick to scripture and therefore in his tragedy of  Tiridate  which was exhibited in the very delicate subject from the Second Book of SAMUEL of the amour of AMNON and his sister TAMER was introduced on the theatre under the veil of profane history This tragedy had but little success and though it has been at different times revived its reception was always so little in its favour that it would have been better for the author and the public if it had been at once consigned to oblivion  Actius  brought out in is so little known and its sate so little remembered that a French author says it is entirely lost to the world except the following line  " Ce grand ACTIUS fous qui l'univers tremble"  Pompeia  This tragedy was published in the works of CAMPISTRON but its original success is  not known His comedies will come more properly hereafter we have therefore nothing now to prevent our leaving the course fairly open to RACINE expect the necessity of noticing PRADON who was the same sort of thorn in RACINE's side that BOURSAULT had been in the side of MOLIERE with very distinct and different pretensions however BOURSAULT having possessed great genius and every literary requisite except a classical education and PRADON having boasted very little from nature without any education at all  The Prince de CONTI meeting PRADON after the first representation of his tragedy of  Tamerlaine    "Why you have transported in your play"  said the Prince  "a town from ASIA to EUROPE"  "I humbly beg your Royal Highness's pardon"  said PRADON  "but I don't understand chronology"    But there were so many authors of that time of the same description in PARIS that PRADON if he had relied on mere patronage without setting himself up as the rival of RACINE might have quietly enjoyed some partial reputation and a good deal of profit but his conduct in society was like that of a fool in company He was perpetually betraying his ignorance in his loquacity instead of prudently concealing it by remaining silent The consequence was that he drew on his head all the vengeance of RACINE's admirers and particularly that of  BOILEAU by which means he was perpetually loaded with literary disgrace In short had he not vainly and ridiculously compared himself to RACINE his name would not have been held in such contempt or in other words had he been modest as a man he would have been considered passable as poet but to speak of RACINE  We have seen in what manner the  Mithridate  BEAUBOURG who was remarkably ugly performed the part of MITHRIDATE When Madmoiselle LECOUVREUR who performed MONIMIA said  "Signor you changed countenance"  "Let him let him"  said a man in the pit  "he can't change for the worse"  and the  Iphigene  of RACINE conquered the  Pulcherie  and the  Surene  of CORNEILLE It will now be proper to speak of the remaining pieces of RACINE which are  Phedre et Hypolite Esther  and  Athalie    Against  Phedre et Hypolite  which came out in the whole force of PRADON's friends was drawn up in martial array not only with a determination to suppress this play of RACINE but to establish another under the same title written by PRADON Among this party Madame DESHOULIERES a celebrated writer was supported by the Duchess of BOUILLON the Duke of NEVERS  her brother and many other persons of distinction The consequence was that RACINE's play had but very indifferent success and that of PRADON was lifted to the skies  Every industry was used to humiliate RACINE and exalt PRADON The boxes to PRADON's play were taken for several nights together so were those to the play of RACINE and paid but they were locked up and left empty that the house might appear as if it were deserted At the same time parties were hired to line the two  parterres  and to applaud one play and hiss the other But the most curious instance of their caprice was that RACINE was execrated for bringing out a piece upon so indecent a subject when the same circumstances equally reprehensible in PRADON was in his favour not only passed by but commended It was said that to raise this cabal it cost this illustrious party fifteen thousand livres  This business at last became very serious Madame DESHOULIERES wrote a sonnet with a view to humiliate RACINE and BOILLAU They suspecting this sonnet to have come from the pen of the Duke of NEVERS answered it by another conserving the same rhimes in which they treated the Duke with great severity He replied by a third  still keeping the same rhimes and finished by a declaration that he would cane them both in the theatre before the public  However the protection of PRADON might be unworthy the illustrious cabal who lent him their countenance and in particular Madame DESHOULIERES it must not be dissembled that RACINE drew it all on his head by the envious the unworthy the bitter the indecent criticisms which he threw out himself and encouraged in his partizans against the venerable CORNEILLE Madame de BOUILLON and her party however wrong their means of revenge meant only to support the cause of that great writer against all the coxcombs in literature who at that time sought every occasion in their power to humiliate him at the head of which very respectable set RACINE ought to have been ashamed of placing himself In protecting PRADON they avenged the author of  Cinna  and it cannot be denied but employing one dunce in a good cause was a thousand times more worthy in them than it was in RACINE to countenance twenty dunces in the support of a bad one  This however upon reflection he thought proper to decline for his cause not being a very good one and RACINE and BOILEAU having been that year chosen by the king to write the history of his reign he was apprehensive by this vindictive spirit he might incur the king's displeasure which conjecture turned out to be well sounded for the king having noticed this unhandsome treatment to RACINE from first to last sent for the Duke himself and represented to him that he not only injured the  cause of literature an object of consequence in all civilized states by protecting dunces to the prejudice of men of talents but that in this particular instance he had insulted two men of merit whom he himself had taken under his royal protection and to whom it was his resolution to shew every possible countenance and attention  Notwithstanding this ample justice done to the reputation of RACINE the humiliation of having so despicable a competitor as PRADON and that it should be possible that the public could hesitate a moment between their different merits determined RACINE at all times excessively vain and feelingly irritable instead of exulting in his triumph and treating the whole business with the ineffable contempt it deserved to retire at once from the theatre In vain did BOILEAU that kind friend whose malignant spirit had led RACINE into all sorts of scrapes entreat him in his seventh epistle to reenter on his dramatic career He persisted stubbornly till twelve years afterwards when he brought out  Esther  from motives of piety  Madame de MAINTENON disgusted with the pieces which were performed by her young scholars at her convent of St CYR prevailed with some difficulty on RACINE to undertake some religious  subject to be represented by these young ladies RACINE after raising many difficulties consented at last and wrote the tragedy of  Esther  which was performed during the Carnaval at St CYR and afterwards at VERSAILLES before the king  Madame de SEVIGNE calls this RACINE's  chef d'oeuvre    "This poet"  says she  "has here surpassed himself He loves his GOD as he loved his mistresses He is as warm on holy subjects as he was on profane All is beautiful grand written with dignity"  VOLTAIRE however does not happen to be of this opinion  "It seems to be"  says he  "very extraordinary that  Esther  had universal success and that  Athalie  though performed but two years afterwards by the same persons had none at all The case was entirely the reverse when these pieces were performed at PARIS long after the author's death and when prejudice and partiality had also died away  Athalie  was represented then as it ought to be with transport and  Esther  was received with coldness and soon forgotten The fact was that at this latter period there were no servile courtiers who complaisantly acknowledged  Esther  in Madame de MAINTENON or malignantly saw  Vashti  in Madame de MONTESPAN or  Hamon  in DE LOUVOIS or above all the persecution  of the Huguenots in the proscription of the Hebrews The impartial public saw nothing in it but a stupid and improbable story A ridiculous prince who had lived six months with his wife without knowing what she was who commanded a whole nation to be murdered without the least pretence  Whatever RACINE might intend this is certainly with M VOLTAIRE's leave a striking picture of the proscription and persecution of the Huguenots  and who afterwards hanged his favourite with as little reason"  Esther  again roused RACINE's enemies whose malignity in revenge for the satire thrown out against them by BOILEAU was so indesatigably exercised that from a variety of representations of the circumstance to Madame de MAINTENON she was taught to believe that she relaxed the morals of her young pensioners by suffering them to exhibit any thing dramatic even though on religious subjects Desirious however to hear  Athalie  especially after RACINE had taken so much pains to please her she consented that the young ladies should repeat the play in the presence of the king in a plain antichamber and without theatrical dresses A piece thus deprived of the advantages of dresses scenery and decorations and upon such a serious  subject could not possibly succeed to any extraordinary degree which circumstance perhaps escaped VOLTAIRE The king however was so well content that he conferred on RACINE the charge of one of his gentlemen in ordinary  I shall now go as shortly as possible into an examination of RACINE of whom more perhaps has been said by the French than of any other poet that ever had existence and certainly more infinitely more than his merit will bear out  VOLTAIRE who know as well that he was unable to write verse with the same tenderness the same beauty and the same harmony as RACINE as he did that in eloquence force and animation he could greatly excel him risked nothing in those rapturous declarations which the world have taken for honest candour and self denying impartiality These are his words on the delineation of RACINE's character of  Phedre    "This"  says he  "is the  chef d'oeuvre  of the human mind and the eternal but inimitable model for the labours of all those who would write verse"  This in Mr VOLTAIRE's opinion seems to stamp RACINE as the first of poets but does it stamp him as the first of dramatic writers At another time when he was speaking with great enthusiasm of the poetry of RACINE he  was asked by a friend why he had not given the world the eulogium of that poet as well as of the great CORNEILLE  "It is already done"  said VOLTAIRE  "we have nothing to do but to write under every page fine pathetic harmonious sublime"  Why did not VOLTAIRE add touching characteristic important philosophic Because these are always to be found in CORNEILLE often in VOLTAIRE and seldom in RACINE  The basis of enthusiastic admiration has seldom much solidity The harmony of numbers the enchantment of language a happy precision a finished elocution all these captivate and entrance the mind but when we are told by reflection or if we are too far gone to reflect by a candid and finished critic that all these qualities are no more than a felicitous variation of the idiom of a particular tongue it is impossible not to confess that in all this superficial deception simplicity nature and the heart have been egregiously outraged and if this is not the case how comes it that RACINE has never been translated I answer because it would take a poet ay and a great poet to translate RACINE whereas a common linguist might translate SHAKESPEAR or even CORNEILLE into any of the living languages  What does all this say but that seduced by this inimitable elegance we shut our eyes to faults much more material and important than the beauties we have been able to discover There is a wide distinction between a great poet and a great author between RACINE for instance and CORNEILLE Where is there in RACINE the painting the variety the depth the grandeur the elevation the force the majesty that pervade the writings of CORNEILLE These are not to be found in study and unfortunately RACINE had no other communication with the Muses I own that CORNEILLE fails in style and taste but style and taste are weak and effeminate literary requisites How such superficial expressions fade away at those more substantial epithets truth and nature I own the writing of CORNEILLE is sometimes hard incorrect perplexed and rude but I strip off this rind and instantly flows a nourishing juice that warms my heart and cheers and exhilerates my spirits  The fact is that we find in CORNEILLE a moralist a philosopher a legislator and yet a poet Love pity pride ambition cruelty remorse repentance mercy clemency are only so many shades which with the assistance of a thousand intermediate tints he colours the picture of human nature RACINE only a poet depicts nothing but love in all its various vicissitudes To love all the other  passions are subservient and as if this were not enough his Cupid is now and then a  petit maitre  and apes all the manners of the French court  CORNEILLE said to SEGRAIS who sat near him on the first representation of  Bajazet    "the personages of this tragedy wear Turkish habits but they utter French sentiments I shall however say this only to you otherwise it will be taken for jealousy which I as much disdain as I love to commend the beautiful poetry of RACINE"    Whenever CORNEILLE has availed himself of history he has taken the circumstances and invented appropriate language for his personages If RACINE wrote  Phedre Britannicus  and  Athalie  he contented himself with versifying EURIPIDES TACITUS and the Scriptures But the great fault of RACINE and that which shews he was by no means a master of dramatic construction is his having given to love the first rank in his tragedies whereas religion general honour patriotism and other important public duties though confirmed conciliated and endeared by love to render the construction of a play grand and interesting ought always to be the primary consideration  The very eulogists of RACINE lose themselves in attempting to draw a comparison between him and CORNEILLE They tell you that CORNEILLE  is like a statue that strikes you by the grandeur the pride the force and the vigour of its form that RACINE is a picture sweet tender delicate natural and animated which through the eyes touches the heart CORNEILLE a torrent that rises up with violence and precipitates itself with impetuosity RACINE a majestic river whose grand and peaceable course conveys delight and expands fertility CORNEILLE an audacious eagle that loses itself in the clouds and seizes the thunder of JUPITER RACINE a tender dove that sails beautifully through the air to the groves of IDALIA from whence it returns training the car of VENUS  That firmness of mind that consciousness of excellence that certainty of superiority necessary to form a great author upon all occasions failed RACINE He flew but he did not soar he always pleased the ear but he seldom reached the heart he every where delighted the imagination but no where touched the soul That which cheated you into an idea of perfection often flattened into dull monotony and fancied sublimity perpetually dwindled into measured numbers  This mental weakness was manifest in all his conduct as a man He was not contented with  fancying himself the greatest writer that ever had existed but he fancied he knew every thing better than every body When he found himself so greatly favoured by Madame de MAINTENON who by the way had only encouraged his muse to humiliate her rival Madame MONTESPAN he actualty projected a plan of finance which he thought would work a complete reformation in the legislature This plan was put on paper and confided to his patroness in whose hands LOUIS the fourteenth found it who not only soundly rated the lady for her officiousness but warmly inveighed against the temerity of the poet  "How"  said he  "because this man can write harmonious verse does he think he knows every thing and because he is a good poet does he fancy himself a great minister"  It was the great misfortune of RACINE that he considered the perfection of versifying the perfection of writing to which BOILEAU who seemed like one of those evil genuises that under the mask of kindness lure men to a precipice and then laugh at them as they are precipitated down did not a little contribute Thus when he thought he had immortalized himself by any work which the public received coldly the shock was too much for his spirits  "Though I own"  said he to BOILEAU  "nothing delights me so much as public applause the least  the most contemptible criticism always gives me more pain than the warmest praise ever gave me pleasure"  Is this a great man a sublime genuis  Many traits in the life of RACINE his epigrams and above all his preface to  Britannicus  where with a heart swelling and a mind stung with envy he endeavoured with the most bitter irony to turn the greatest part of CORNEILLE's pieces into ridicule discover in RACINE that pityful littleness of mind that caustic and irascible spirit which HORACE attributes to all poets whom he pleasantly calls the choleric race  This perpetual discontent and eternal irritability abridged his life After the business of his improving the finance Madame de MAINTENON gave him to understand that the king was so little satisfied with him that he had better not appear at court till the storm was blown over determined however to be convinced he appeared before the king who took no notice of him This severe humiliation he could not brook he therefore retired to his native country where he is said to have lingered a twelvemonth in a most distracted state of mind and then to have died on the twentyfirst of April in of a broken heart  Faithful to the immutable dictates of sacred truth let us not withhold a fair tribute of praise to RACINE As a poet he has been unfortunately spoken of to the exclusion of all others If his friends had not been so warm in his praise his works would not have demanded so critical an investigation and he would have been accorded his own fair legitimate portion of commendation without the necessity of shewing by comparison how inferior he was to those he is said to have excelled  In its general sense RACINE certainly did not belong to the first class of writers which must be indispensibly composed of men of original genius nor did he more in its particular sense the art he exercised being of a secondary nature  The classes of writers particularly considered may be divided into a large number at the head of which stands first the epic second the dramatic and soon after the lyric poet but any number of any one of these particular classes may belong to the first class of writers taken generally if possessed of original genius  It will be my business hereafter to enlarge upon this    Thus RACINE having neither possessed original  genius nor written epic poetry cannot generally nor particularly be classed otherwise than as a secondary writer His labours however are both ingenious and meritorious and will ensure him a large portion of fame with all those who consider taste and style as the standard of literature but I believe they are few writers who would not rather like CORNEILLE be esteemed by the wise admired by the judicious and emulated by men of genius than like RACINE be the criterion of the fashionable the wonder of the inexperienced and the idol of the ladies  CHAP V DANCOURT AND OTHER AUTHORS TO CREBILLON  HAVING principally spoken of tragedy in the last chapter in order that RACINE might be more properly before the reader I shall now return to the time when DANCOURT gave a new turn to comedy certainly an imitation of MOLIERE but beyond all question as far as it went in every respect an improvement for by aiming at less of the ARISTOPHANES his satire is more general and less offensive  DANCOURT was born at FONTAINBLEAU in he was educated under Father DE LA RUE a Jesuit who finding him a young man of excellent understanding did all in his power to retain him as a member of that fraternity He however declared for the bar but finding that study too straitened and dry for the vivacity and penetration of a genius like his he finally determined for the  stage where he made so great a progress that like MOLIERE he became director of the theatre  Though DANCOURT brought out no less than fiftytwo pieces besides six or eight others attributed to him his subjects lie in a small circle round which he perpetually turned Tricksters of every description he had a most happy knack of exposing and to employ this talent he found an inexhaustible source of materials in painting the manners of middling life and the cunning of those who are kind friends and good neighbours except upon those occasions when interest renders them callous to generosity and insensible to good fellowship  These ordinary feelings and actions of mankind which pervade every order of society he most happily pursued even to the lowest peasants If his scene was a village or even a mill the subtilty with which interest teaches men to betray those they appear to love was no less refined than if his characters had been financiers or procureurs and indeed in painting rustic manners no man ever was so happy His clowns are so simple and so natural yet so fine and so cunning and manage their intrigues with such keen dexterity that in interest a statesman might envy the art and adroitness of BLAISE and  in love a woman of fashion might be proud to emulate the coquettry and capriciousness of BABET  The lightest circumstance furnished him with an idea for an entertainment An adventure a fashion a proverb became a subject of moment dramatised by DANCOURT His pieces are all light but they are ingenious regular managed adroitly and without embarrassment His dialogue is natural lively rapid full of gaiety and sparkling with wit written five plays excepted  Three of these pieces are  Le Trabison Puni Madame Artus  and  Sancho Panco Gouverneur  The first which is from the Spanish was afterwards successfully brought forward by LE SAGE in prose The second was a bad imitation of  Le Tartuffe  and  Sanco  had no effect till it was in reduced into one act by POINSINIT and assisted by the music of PHILIDOR The other two  Caphale et Pro  is  and  La Metempsicose  are certainly inferior to all the rest of his works  which are by no means the best of his works in prose a strong proof of his good sense Not that he was unequal to the task of writing poetry for his pieces are sometimes interspersed with little songs masques and divertisements which are written very neatly and which upon the whole rank his genius somewhere between PRIOR and VANBRUGH which last whatever his obligations were to nature was as I shall hereafter particularize also highly obliged to DANCOURT  The pieces of DANCOURT which have best established his reputation are  La Femme D'intrigue Le Chevalier a la Mode Les Bourgeoises a la Mode  and the  Agioteurs  These except the last are pieces of five acts and for conduct truth colouring and spirit no comedies can be better managed nor characters drawn His secondary class are  La Maison de Campaigne La Parisienne Le Tuteur La Foire de Bezons Le Galant Jardinier  and five or six others in all which the circumstances are strong the characters natural and the dialogue lively and unaffected  A third sort are those picturesque trifles admirable in their way where he has availed himself of any temporary circumstance Such are  La Loterie  In this piece he ridicules all PARIS for having run after a man of the name of FAGNANI He was a kind of a picture broker and dealer in curiosities and having a large stock of fanciful articles by him he obtained permission to sell them by a lottery in which there were to be no blanks This bait induced the public to take all his tickets off his hands but it was at last found that ninetenths of the prizes were inconsiderable trifles and that every thing of value reverted to him through the channel of friends employed for the purpose and who were rewarded by him for thus playing booty    Les curieux de Compeigne  This piece was written in consequence of a camp being formed near the town of COMPEIGNE which was reviewed by LOUIS the fourteenth before whom a siege and other military manoeuvres were represented The jet of the plot is to throw some citizens and their families into situations of whimsical distress which it must be confessed DANCOURT has managed very adroitly    Le Mari Retrouvé  A very whimsical and extraordinary circumstance at that time the town talk of PARIS induced DANCOURT to write this comedy A person of the name of PIVARDIERE having absconded his relations instituted an enquiry into the situation of his affairs and in order to possess his property accused his wife of procuring persons to assasinate him The matter was going very hard against her when PIVARDIERE who had merely gone from his family upon a party of pleasure came back to set every thing to rights The lawyers however determined to make a good profit of it strained every nerve to prove that PIVARDIERE was an impostor and they so far succeeded that his identity was not allowed till he had at a great expence brought the business before the parliament when having gained their point by filling their pockets they acknowledged their error and made a parade of doing both PIVARDIERE and his wife every possible justice    Le Vert Galant  This piece was also a representation of a whimsical fact A certain Abbe made warm love to a dyer's wife who offended at his importunities without hesitation informed her husband of the honour designed him It was upon this concerted between them that the husband in the Abbe's hearing should inform his wife that he was obliged through business to leave her for some time The Abbe of course profitting by this good fortune no sooner saw the husband set out on his journey but he redoubled his solicitations and after a great deal of affected coyness on her part he prevailed on the wife to let him visit her at supper He had however no sooner sat down than the husband thundered at the door when in making his escape by the lady's direction through a passage which led to the dyehouse he fell into a vat where he floundered for a long time and at length came out completely green from head to foot  and several others His  fourth class but by no means his worst are pieces generally of one act containing a neat unaffected plot spiritedly begun well followed and roundly finished Among these we find  La Gazette L'Opera de Village Les Vendanges Le Moulin de Javelle Les eaux de Bourbon Les Vacances Colin Maillard  and about eight more  It has been said that what REGNARD was to MOLIERE in the higher style of comedy DANCOURT was to the same degree in farce Nothing can more clearly prove his good sense than this remark for that part of MOLIERE's works which approaches nearest to farce is by infinite degrees his best and it would have ill suited the bent of DANCOURT's genuis to have attempted any thing of a grander kind As it is by diversifying extending and indeed improving this lighter species of dramatic amusement his pieces have ever been deservedly celebrated had he attempted any thing more he might have been respectable but he never would have been popular  It has been laid to DANCOURT's charge that he foisted on the public the works of other people as his own but the same thing has been said of every author of merit that ever existed In support  of these accusations against DANCOURT it is insisted that being a manager of a theatre and constantly in possession of a variety of new pieces he appropriated such as he thought proper to his own use and having kept copies of them returned them to their different authors as improper for representation  This assertion however stands upon very feeble ground indeed and seems to have originated from that envy which the poet tells us pursues merit as its shadow There is no piece of DANCOURT let the materials be ever so slight that is not touched with the hand of a master How could he then reap advantage from the essays of novices For he is not accused of robbing a single adept Indeed the best name they can produce and almost the only one to corroborate this improbable assertion is that of SAINTYON who is suspected to be the author of  Le Chevalier a la Mode  and  Les Bourge  isis a la Mode  two comedies of considerable merit in point of construction the latter being almost word for word our admirable play of  The Confederacy  and known to be the author of  Les Facons du Temps  and  Danae  two pieces which though touched up by RICCOBONI and DOMINIQUE and pussed by BOURSAULT's celebrated VISE who  was paid for his pains were considered by the public as most contemptible productions  Those who can read with judgement will very easily see that the works of DANCOURT are uniformly written by the same person They are collected into nine volumes with the greatest care by his friends who one should suppose would have made these distinctions had they been necessary and they bear the signature of DE LA MOTTE whose duty it was to sign the privilege of the king and whose advice both for the sake of truth and out of care for the reputation of DANCOURT whom he admired would of course have been to publish no more than was legitimately his I shall hereafter resume DANCOURT as an actor and a manager  REGNARD a respectable writer who is said to have divided the genuis of MOLIERE with DANCOURT certainly not only chose the worst and the most difficult part but that to which he was unequal The higher style of MOLIERE's comedy is in verse and unfortunately for REGNARD in such verse as he was incapable of writing He did right however for had he chosen that part which DANCOURT improved he would have been worse off VOLTAIRE who loves to afford left handed praise  says that he who is not pleased with REGNARD is not worthy to admire MOLIERE The truth is that had REGNARD never heard of such a writer as MOLIERE he would have been a better writer himself Every man should use his own faculties such as they are and scorn the servility of imitation  When I call imitation servility I mean that imitation by which a writer condescends to ape a man's style and manner such was REGNARD's imitation of MOLIERE That broad principal upon which DANCOURT imitated MOLIERE is a very different thing for DANCOURT had nothing of MOLIERE in his style but its general vivacity and brilliancy dressed in expressions of his own Besides the characteristic of this imitation was that chaste representation of mind and manners which MOLIERE imitated from the ancients and the ancients from nature This is what VOLTAIRE most admirably likens to l  ghting your candle by the candle of your neighbour which candle while it lends fire to be fed by the substance of yours loses nothing of its own This remark however is to be found in CHAUCER    REGNARD who was born of rich parents in in the early part of his life visited many of the courts of EUROPE In one of his voyages in the MEDITERANEAN he was taken by a Corsair and sold afterwards for fifteen hundred livres His master carried him to CONSTANTINOPLE where he was a long time a slave finding means however to inform his friends of his situation they paid his ransom and he returned to FRANCE bringing with him his chains which in imitation of AESOP and other  great men he preserved to remind him of his former adversity  REGNARD between and brought out six pieces at the ancient Italian theatre  It will be necessary once more to remind the reader that before the regular establishment of the Italian theatre in at the  Hotel de Bourgogne  a company of Italians performed  au petit Bourbon  alternately with MOLIERE and continued there after he had removed to the  Palais Royal  till when the theatre was pull  d down to build the entrance to the  Louvre  and the Italians were entirely dispersed though they might it is said have rall  ed again but for a very singular circumstance G  RARDI who was at that time the Harlequin in one of those pieces of which he collected a large number described the character of a prude in such a manner as seemed to point at Madame de MAINTENON This his enemies in  ously represented to his disadvantage and his disgrace followed of course  These were none of those in which he copied MOLIERE but if they had been any of them they would have done him but little credit for they were flunzy enough and their success was so little to the reputation of their author or DOMINIQUE who produced them that there is an anecdote of his erasing some of them from his stock catalogue  His pieces for the French theatre amounting to eight have more pretensions to merit particularly  Le Joueur de Bal Le Distrait Democrite  and  Les Menechmes  but even these are full of defects  having but little original in them and being written in dull monotonous verse with little energy and less interest The  Distrait  makes a better figure in BRUYERE  Democrite  is a strange jumble of improbability and  Les Menechmes  originally from PLAUTUS is altered very little for the better from ROTROU Upon the whole  Le Joueur  is his best comedy which has interest situation and character enough to give it consequence were it not for the negligent heavy and prosaic verse in which it is written  DUFRESNY was an author of considerable merit His pieces upwards of thirty in number are generally an irregular jumble careless and negligent and yet they are not without ingenuity sprightliness and nature Their grand fault is indecency which however in FRANCE has seldom impeded the success of dramatic representations of the ligher kind nay some of those which have been performed on the  Boulevards  have if I may so express myself no other merit  It is very well known that DUFRESNY was descended from HENRY the fourth That king having had an amour with a woman who was called LA BELLE JARDINIERE the consequence of which was the birth of DUFRESNY's grandfather LOUIS  fourteenth did not dissemble the fact but on that account afforded him his particular countenance and protection  It is astonishing how variously gifted this man was and yet how little he knew He had a taste for poetry painting sculpture architecture and agriculture but his great delight was music and though nothing could beat into him the smallest comprehension of its theoretical principles yet he made many melodies which are printed at the end of his works and which evince a musical mind if he had known how to have put it into action His method was when he had invented his tune to sing it to GRANDVAL who as well as an actor was a musician after which GRANDVAL wrote it down and added the accompanyments  As extraordinary things are said of his knowledge of design in which he used no pencil nor crayon but a pair of scissars fashioning every kind of animate and inanimate object with the most critical symetry and taste Models for sculpture he formed in the same extemporaneous manner with clay and wax and his knowledge of agriculture which he is very gravely said to have inherited from  his great grandmother was both as to ornament and utility uncommonly great and extensive  The gardens of MIGNAUX near POISSY those in the FAUXBOURG SAINT ANTOINE called  Du Moulin  and  Le Chemin Creux  those of the Abbe PAJOT near DE VINCENNES are proofs of his superior taste and judgement in this study LOUIS the fourteenth determined to make the gardens at VERSAILLES surpass in grandeur and magnificence every thing of that kind seen before submitted his plan to DUFRESNY who suggested many material alterations with which the king was greatly pleased but objected to them on account of the prodigious expence that would be incurred had the plan been carried into execution He however to shew DUFRESNY how much he admired his spirit and taste made him controller of his gardens  This projector afterwards was at the head of a glass manufactory which had prodigious success With all these fortunate advantages however DUFRESNY was always behind hand This induced him when he had brought this manufactory to perfection to sell his concern in it for a very moderate sum which circumstance coming to the ears of the king he obliged those who had taken advantage of his  necessity and ingenuity to allow him three thousand livres a year His extravagance however knew no bounds and it was not long before he agreed with his partners to give up the annuity for a given sum on which the king was heard to say  "that the public treasury would not content DUFRESNY  It is DUFRESNY at whom LE SAGE points the following passage in the  Diable Boiteux    "I'll send you also"  says the Devil  "an old bachelor of a good family who the moment he has a ducat spends it and who rather than be without one is capable of doing any thing to obtain it A fortnight ago his washerwoman to whom he was indebted thirty pistoles came to dun him for the money and told him that she was going to be married to a Valet de Chambre and wanted that sum to make up her portion What then you are rich said he it must be so for where the devil is the valet de chambre who would take you with thirty pistoles Rich  ay to be sure said she besides your thirty pistoles I have two hundred ducats Two hundred ducats cried he with emotion a good round sum I'll tell you what send the valet de chambre to the devil marry me and we shall be quit all round Would you believe it Tempted by the ducats he has made his washer woman his wife"  "  Many of his dramatic pieces only two of which  L'esprit de Contradiction  and  Le Lot Supposè  succeeded in his life time have been revived at different times either at the Italian theatre or the Fairs but though the major part of them are printed in his works they have now been banished the theatre for many years  POISSON whom I shall speak of here only as an author brought forward between and nine pieces seven of which are each in one act one is in five acts and the other in three It is not so much the number of pieces or their estimation in point of weight and consequence that entitles the performances of POISSON to particular mention here as the simplicity and nature in their style by which they are distinguished  His personages are like those of DANCOURT chosen from the middle order of society whose tone and language he has happily caught and though it must be confessed that his pieces are feeble on the side of invention they are designed with that intelligence and executed with that facility which evince judgement and experience in their author  He is considered as the inventor of the character of CRISPIN and these pieces are evidently written to support that character which he always performed himself Its outline is light pleasantry insinuating flattery perpetual importunity one who meddles with every thing is attached to nothing and who seems more interested in proportion as the circumstance is contemptible These qualities he has woven into his pieces and characterized by innumerable  tints and shades to shew off the finesse of his acting in which he was supposed to excel all other performers  La Fou de Qualité  which he dedicated to LANGELY the fool of LOUIS the fourteenth  Les Faux Muscovites  This piece was written upon a particular occasion After POTEMSKIN and ROMANZOFF ambassadors from MUSCOVY had made their entrance into PARIS being the first of their nation that ever visited FRANCE in that capacity every public place of course made grand preparations for their reception and among the rest the theatres The  Hotel de Bourgogne  however had not the honour of their presence for after a variety of promises and appointments they had their audience of leave without visiting that place of amusement POISSON in revenge said that as they could not have the real Muscovites he would introduce false ones The idea tickled the public and the piece had great success  and two or three others may rank fairly by the side of those pieces written by DANCOURT I shall hereafter speak of POISSON as an actor  The pieces of LE NOBLE are of so little celebrity that I should pass over that author entirely but for the rank in literature he otherwise held and for those strange adventures which arose out of his singular conduct  LE NOBLE was born at TROYES in of a family of distinction and was given entirely through his merit a charge of procureur general of the  parliament of METZ He enjoyed for some years a brilliant reputation and a large fortune when he was all of a sudden accused of forgery conveyed to the  Chatelet  and condemned to make  amende honorable  and to be banished for nine years He appealed against the sentence merely to gain time and in the mean while he was committed to the  Conçergerie    GABRIELLE PERREAU known by the name of LA BELLE EPICIERE was at that time in the same prison where she had been sent by her husband for infidelity and other ill conduct She was handsome and LE NOBLE not insensible of her charms undertook to be her advocate She in return was not ungrateful A handsome man with a lively and sensible imagination and who spoke and wrote to admiration was the very object to her mind They lived together upon the most familiar terms till an apprehension of a living witness of their intercourse obliged them to take measures to prevent a discovery  LE NOBLE bad prolonged the proceedings with great address both against her and himself and upon this emergency he managed that she should be received into a convent to lie in as a pensioner In this situation he concerted his measures so cunningly  that when she was able to go out he evaded the vigilence of his keepers and retired to an obscure part of PARIS where she soon joined him first leaving the child behind her as a present to the holy sisters of the convent They were soon routed obliged to leave PARIS and lived for some years an errant and a vagrant life during which time the lady brought him two more children  At length he was taken again put into prison and immediately condemned to make the  amende honorable  in the chamber of the  Chatelet  and to be banished the kingdom for nine years and at the same time his lady's cause was determined which decision released her husband from all charge upon her account and obliged LE NOBLE to provide for her and her three children What degree of ignominious punishment he sustained we are not told but one should suppose it was as slight as the nature of the circumstance would admit for he was permitted after a short banishment to return to FRANCE where he figured away with incredible reputation as a writer  His troubles however had no power to restrain his irregularities He continued incorrigible the whole of his life and at length died in consequence of his dissipation at the age of sixty eight and was  buried at the expence of the parish after having gained the booksellers a hundred thousand crowns His works which are published in twenty volumes are upon various subjects and generally well written Among them are to be found four dramatic pieces which like those of FONTENELLE and LA FONTAINE seem to have been more the fruits of leisure hours than the employment of that time which he devoted to the assistance of his literary reputation Their titles are  Esope Les Deux Arlequins Thalestris  and  Le Fourbe    The swarm of inferior authors who infested the theatres and inundated the public about this period every one a MOLIERE in imagination I shall neither have room nor have I inclination to introduce I cannot however pass by BRUEYS and PALAPRAT who wrote in conjunction several pieces for the theatre BRUEYS was born in PROVENCE in and was bred up a Calvanist He made himself remarkable early in life by writing against BOSSUET's  Exposition de la Foi  That prelate in combating his reasons converted him and when he had become a Roman Catholic he was altogether as zealous against the Protestants as he had been formerly strenuous in their favour He was however ill calculated for disputes of this kind and therefore left theology for the theatre  PALAPRAT was born at TOULOUSE in As a poet he had a lively and pleasant imagination and as a man he was candid ingenuous and unoffending Alike unconscious of his philanthropy or his wit he was kind to others for his own gratification and he delighted the world while he thought he was instructing himself thus if THEMISTOCLES asked when his hearers laughed if he had said a foolish thing PALAPRAT might have asked with the same simplicity as his hearers admired him  "What have I said worthy of attention"  The similitude of dispositions and merit in BRUEYS and PALAPRAT pointed them out to each other as proper associates in literature They brought out in conjunction a great number of pieces  Le Grondeur  is said to be superior to any thing in MOLIERE This however is saying too much of it though it cannot be denied that it is full of whimsical pleasantry and well conducted intrigue  Le Muet  is imitated from the  Eunuch  of TERENCE but certainly written with much more warmth than its model  L'Important de Cour  which neither wants fire nor humour is however wrongly named for the principal character is not by any means a person of importance but a pityful provincial pretender  who awkwardly apes courtly manners without understanding them  Le Force du Sang L'Opiniatre Les Empyriques Les Quiproquo  and  Les Embarras du derriere du Theatre  have all some pleasant passages  L'Opiniatre  is in verse and therefore hard and dry and though full of action it has no humour The principal character is a mere chalk drawing Upon the whole  L'avocat Patelin  is the best piece produced by these associates and is a meritorious attempt to restore the ancient farce originally invented by the  Children  of  Sans Souci  and greatly encouraged at the time of FRANCIS the first and which without doubt MOLIERE had frequently in his eye  The ancient French farces having a distinct character of their own and being unlike those of any other nation will hereafter demand particular notice especially as they involve a variety of singular and whimsical circumstances  L'avocat Patelin  is no more than one of those farces modernized It is a sort of dramatic proverb and meant to express in action the sense of the old adage  "the rogue a rogue and a half"  It was originally written in the reign of FRANCIS the first by PIERRE PATHELIN to expose on the stage that standing dish the chicanery of lawyers and therefore called by BRUEYS and PALAPRAT  L'avocat Patelin  a term signifying a trickster and no doubt incorporated into the French language from PATHELIN exactly as we have seen  Turlupinade  from TURLUPIN    These are the most material of those pieces which  were brought out by these friends for friends they strictly were induced one would think by a remarkable parity in their genius dispositions habits and manners nay even their bodily infirmities which rendered them a constant prey to doctors and particularly to the nephew of BRUEYS a man of medical celebrity  They were both remarkably shortsighted and one day when the king who was very partial to BRUEYS asked him how his eyes were he answered  "I humbly thank your majesty my nephew SIDOBRE says that I see a little better"  Thus equal in reputation in simplicity and in credulity they lived upon the kindest terms for many years At length not without strong regret on both sides they parted PALAPRAT followed the fortune of VENDÔME into ITALY and BRUEYS retired to MONTPELIER where he died at the age of eightythree having survived his friend only a year  CHAP VI CREBILLON AND THE STATE OF TRAGEDY TO VOLTAIRE  CREBILLON who stands at the head of those dramatic writers that immediately succeeded RACINE now claims our attention he being the only author who knew how to make advantage of the occasion that then presented itself of emulating the reputation of CORNEILLE and RACINE without imitating either of them  CREBILLON was born at DIJON of an ancient and noble family in and died at PARIS in He was intended by nature to pursue in literature a career of his own which was the more fortunate for him as CORNEILLE had appropriated to himself the majesty and RACINE the tenderness of tragedy He disdained to follow their steps perhaps less impelled by choice than compulsion genius seldom balances it decides It projects less than it executes  CREBILLON determined to chuse a sure road struck into the path that AESCHYLUS had trod before him which he pursued with a strength and a regularity that AESCHYLUS never knew His style was all nerve all force it had neither the elevation of CORNEILLE nor the elegance of RACINE He preferred astonishment to admiration strength to harmony and his male and vigorous pencil seldom drew any but terrible objects It was a tyrant who while he exacted your obedience made you tremble in his presence  CREBILLON's first tragedy  Idoménée  was brought out in The public balanced at the bold style in which it was written and complained against the fifth act It was withdrawn and a new fifth act written when its success was prodigious  BOILEAU who never could be quiet said that this tragedy seemed as if written by RACINE when he was drunk    Atree et Thyeste  produced in gave CREBILLON's reputation stronger footing Nevertheless the boldness of his style induced the audience on the first night to pause on its merits It was impossible to blame but they knew not to what degree to applaud judiciously  CREBILLON used to relate to his friends that after the first representation of this piece he encountered an English gentleman in a coffee house who paid him many compliments on his tragedy of which he doubted the sincerity as the piece was then hanging in a dubious state  "Sir"  said CREBILLON  "I am afraid you are premature in your praises"  "What do you mean"  said the other  "because of your irresolute audience of last night Entirely in your favour depend upon it Your play is written for the meridian of LONDON and not of PARIS Here they learn patriotism in LONDON they know it by heart"  It  grew however on the public and became a great favourite  Electre  came out in with much reputation but  Radamiste et Zenobie  lifted the same of CREBILLON to that height where it has ever since deservedly been placed It is certainly one of the  chef d'oeuvres  of the French theatre and the astonishing success it met with was greatly its due  BOILEAU who was then on his death bed could not nevertheless resist his blended propensity of ill nature and injustice Having read  Radamiste et Zenobie    "take away this balderdash"  said he  "the race of the PRADONS were eagles compared to the groveling CREBILLONS Take it away it encreases my malady"  In his next piece  Xerxes  brought forward in he was less happy It had but one representation When it was over he asked for the parts from the actors and burnt them before their faces saying  "I was in the wrong the public have undeceived me"  There is good writing in this piece but the author killed almost all the characters a circumstance  at which the French have always with justice revolted  Semiramis  came out in This is the play which as we shall hereafter see VOLTAIRE took for the model of his tragedy under that title and which induced so many squibs and epigrams at his expence It had considerable success when CREBILLON first produced it  Pyrrhus  performed in was a tragedy written upon a new model and therefore did not greatly succeed CREBILLON had been reproached with introducing so much cruelty on the stage that he therefore resolved to try his hand at tenderness We are told he worked for five years at this tragedy and at last though it had its particular merits the audience gave but little credit to them because written by a man who instead of the pathetic had been accustomed to produce the terrible  As  Catalina  CREBILLON's next piece was not produced till at which time he might be considered as cotemporary with VOLTAIRE I remit a further account of him till that time when as far as it may be necessary I shall also notice his son  LONGEPIERRE who was celebrated for three tragedies under the titles of  Medee Electre  and  Sesostris  was a proof how extremely difficult authors found it to steer like CREBILLON wide of CORNEILLIE and RACINE and yet succeed Searching for the beauties of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES they forgot the age in which they were writing  Medée  which is said to have been superior to CORNEILLE is full of declamation cold unequal and prolix  Electre  from which piece however VOLTAIRE has not disdained to borrow some circumstances in his  Oreste  is a Greek dressed in a French habit a statue of PRAXITELES disfigured by a modern bungler and as for  Sesostris  it was performed but once and was never printed  There is a curious anecdote of RACINE relative to this piece He wrote an epigramfor which the following lines may serve as a translationimmediately after the failure of  Sesostris  which came out three years after his  Athalie    EPIGRAM  The famous SESOSTRIS that valiant chief  Who the fates mighty EGYPT permitted to sway  Who there lived a round age and then died for their grief  To the joy of all PARIS lived here but a day  It was RACINE's foible now and then to distil from his pen a little of BOILEAU's gall and having sancred that he had here made a good hit he circulated these lines as generally as he could but hearing that LONGEPI  RR  had written a parallel between him and CORNEILLE and completely given him the victory he industriously collected the copies back again and did every thing in his power to prevent his being known as the author    LA GRANGE CHANCEL who wrote with considerable celebrity would have ensured himself a more brilliant fame had he not servilely followed RACINE who indeed was his preceptor in the art of letters if it be not a profanation to call that an art which is incapable of being taught by any other preceptor than nature  LA GRANGE was born near PERIGUEUX in and he died at PARIS in having rendered himself remarkable for employing his pen from nine years old till within two years of his death Having been puffed up with early success he ventured at some indiscreet satires for which he was confined in the Islands of Saint MARGUERITE whence after a year he contrived to escape and by means of friends which he conjured up wherever he went he was kindly received by the king of SARDINIA and afterwards he rendered himself useful to the king of SPAIN  The Spanish nobles jealous of this distinction planned his destruction and it was with the utmost difficulty he escaped assassination Finding that SPAIN was no place for him he embarked for AMSTERDAM There he procured an introduction to  the Ambassador of AUGUSTUS king of POLAND who finding him full of political intelligence took him to POLAND at his return where AUGUSTUS invited him to his court and made him considerable presents  After the death of those he had satirized who had been his persecutors in FRANCE he ventured to return to his native country The ministers of state very soon courted his alliance knowing that the intelligence he must have gathered by his intimate knowledge of the affairs of foreign courts would render him of infinite service to them in the prosecution of their views This party he readily embraced and after that he lived safe favoured and opulent  His writings which are full of genius and inexperience are a mixture of temerity and fear Every thing is ventured nothing prepared Love and hatred fury and moderation are violently dragged in without motive or management Insults are committed and pardoned anger is kindled and extinguished nobody knows why Soaring after the sublime he seizes the bombast and studying for the beautiful he is lost in the bathos His grandeur is burlesque and his simplicity puerility  The severity of these truths however would not have attached to the writings of LA GRANGE had he like CREBILLON disdained imitation His first piece  Adherbal  brought out in and written when he was only fourteen years of age is spoken of as an astonishing attempt for such a youth and very probably he might have claimed the merit of an original writer had he not suffered his fancy at that tender season when the mind takes and retains impressions to be so cramped and lamed as to have little power afterwards to exercise its natural functions  "When I had put the finishing stroke"  says LA GRANGE  "to this tragedy I hazarded the liberty of presenting it to the Princesse de CONTI who in spight of all its faults found something in it so worthy her attention that she sent for the celebrated RACINE and entreated him to read this essay these were her words of a young gentleman who was her page and to give him his advice without disguise RACINE kept the piece eight days and then informed the Princess that he had read my tragedy with astonishment and though it was very defective in many places if I would permit him to give me a few lessons he had no doubt but in a short time it would be in such a state as to appear with success I did not fail to call on him every day for a considerable while and may fairly say that I learnt more from him than from all the books I had ever read"  Here it is evident that LA GRANGE took leave of nature to study art in the school of RACINE just as painters become mannerists and are never afterwards capable of improvement Going on he tells you that the piece came out that he sat at its first representation with the Prince de CONTI who said that the author's age would silence the tongue of criticism and that under this influence the piece had wonderful success The circumstance at any rate is not wonderful for patronage would at that time do any thing with the public and we have seen the silly PRADON atchieve greater feats even against RACINE through influence of a much inferior kind    Three years afterwards was produced  Oreste et Pilade  which is said to have been written by LA GRANGE from a plan drawn by RACINE It was performed a few nights and then kept back on account of the death of the celebrated CHAMPMELE after which it was wholly withdrawn  In appeared  Meleagre  which however succeeded but indifferently and in the same year he brought forward  Athenais  which piece was attacked by LE NOBLE and others and warmly defended by its author and the little success it had seems to have sprung from this controversy  Amosis  in  Alceste  in  Ino et Melicerte  in and  Sophonisbe  in are all the remainder of those pieces written by LA GRANGE before VOLTAIRE  Amasis  was violently attacked and it must be confessed was very vulnerable  Alceste  was said to be no more than a plan from RACINE filled up by LA GRANGEindeed we are  told that RACINE left in the possession of LA GRANGE many of those plans some of which were partly written in prose and those fragments which are published in his works lend probability to the report  Ino et Melicerte  had no success and  Soprionisbe  is remembered by nothing but four remarkable lines  As these lines are said to be worth all the rest of this author's works and certainly are uncommonly fine admitting the sentiment they contain I have transcribed them  Songez qu'il est des tems on tout est legitime  Et que si la Patrie avoit besoin d'un crime  Qui puis seul relever son espoir abattu  Il ne seroit plus crime et deviendroit vertu    LA FOSSE attempted what CREBILLON afterwards perfected Like him he had a strong mind full of grandeur and dignity but probably fearing to attack so revolting a style of writing as terror which requires more strength and suror than majesty and tenderness and is yet subordinate to both he strove in vain to imitate AESCHYLUS till finding how difficult it is to be original he at length contented himself with copying CORNEILLE as servilely as LA GRANGE had copied RACINE so that during the interval between CAMPISTRON and CREBILLON tragedy languished under the  feeble support of these shadows of two men one of whom had given it life and vigour and the other polish and refinement  LA FOSSE wrote four tragedies in which it is plain to be seen that CORNEILLE was the  Phoebus  to whom he condescended to become the  Phoeton  These tragedies were called  Polixene  brought out in  Manlius Capitolinus  in  Thesee  in and  Corésus  in Of all which plays it has been said but of  Manlius Capitolinus  in particular that CORNEILLE might not have been ashamed of being known as the author but this is going a great deal too far for though they contain many passages that reflect a respectability on the writer they are upon the whole heavy dull and uninteresting and evince the certain painful difficult and unfruitful result of their pursuits who fetter genius and study to be natural  Both LA GRANGE and LA FOSSE owe their reputation such as it was and consequently the notice taken of them here to the adventitious circumstance of appearing at a time when they could comfortably consider themselves respectively as representatives of CORNEILLE and RACINE merely because they had no formidable opponent And now unless I were to substitute writings for literature and  names for merit I see nothing to prevent my coming immediately to that remarkable era in French dramatics when the united abilities of so many men of great and extraordinary talents brought the stage in that country into decided reputation in all its various branches under the powerful influence of VOLTAIRE  CHAP VII STATE OF THE FRENCH THEATRE ON TO THE YEAR  FLUCTUATING timid irresolute and unsettled as the French stage was at this period nothing perhaps could have raised its reputation to any pitch of excellence but the appearance of the only man who seemed born to render his country that service Tragedy had been thitherto considered under three distinct heads the grand the tender and the terrible and these had separately been carried as far as possible by CORNEILLE RACINE and CREBILLON No man had dreamt that the French had never seen a real tragedy a species of production which to be perfect must involve a union of these three great essentials till VOLTAIRE born with little genius and less intuition but endowed with a judgment almost equal to the happiest efforts of both plainly shewed not only the practicability but the necessity of this measure by fairly stepping before  his three celebrated countrymen and building a lasting reputation for himself with the valuable materials they had left behind them  It cannot however be denied that his fame is fair honest and legitimate for though had these authors never lived he would have been at a loss how to have exercised those talents which had not been given to inspire him with invention though greatly to perfect the inventions of others as he possessed himself of the essence of their respective merits as those merits were rendered more brilliant in his hands their appropriation more respectable and as those he added gave them a consequence and a rank they had not been able to support alone we cannot refuse him the praise due to exertions so highly meritorious  But this is not all the length justice obliges us to go VOLTAIRE added to tragedy a colouring a harmony a fire a variety till then unknown to it He did more The tragic poets had contented themselves with rendering vice odious he rendered virtue amiable His productions are the panegyric of humanity and his moral appeals to all hearts  VOLTAIRE was born at PARIS November He brought out on the French theatre  twentyeight plays five of which appeared during the interval that will occupy this chapter The first of these performed in was  Oedipe  The success of this tragedy was brilliant beyond all example He had however great difficulty to get it accepted by the actors and he submitted to alter it out of compliment to their opinion several times whether for the better or the worse cannot now be discovered but it was considered very complete in all its requisites when it did appear  Many anecdotes are related of the effect this tragedy had on different persons Marshal VILLARS told VOLTAIRE that he considered  Oedipe  as an obligation he had conferred on his country  "A very inconsiderable one"  said VOLTAIRE  "in comparison with the smallest of those that you have conferred on your country"  Another time a nobleman who was handing a lady to her carriage after one of the representations of this piece said to VOLTAIRE  "see what you have done Do you know that you have drawn a torrent of tears from these beautiful eyes"  "They'll have their revenge my lord"  said VOLTAIRE The Duke D'ORLEANS who had sent VOLTAIRE to the Bastile on seeing  Oedipe  sent immediately to release him The poet went instantly to thank the Prince  "Be more prudent for the future VOLTAIRE"  said he  "and I'll watch over your fortune"  "I humbly thank your Royal Highness"  said VOLTAIRE  "and shall consider myself greatly honoured by your generosity provided you don't furnish me with board and lodging again"    Artémire  produced in had no success and was withdrawn by its author so suddenly and so  completely suppressed that solicitous as the publishers of VOLTAIRE's works have been to collect his whole writings bad and good it is not known exactly what shape it wore upon its first representation The most material parts of it however were afterwards taken into  Mariamne  which was performed for the first time in This piece did not succeed to any great degree the first season but when it was altered and brought forward on the following year under the title of  Herode et Mariamne  it experienced very solid and confirmed success  This piece was the source of the quarrels between VOLTAIRE and ROUSSEAU ROUSSEAU wrote a letter to a friend which accidently or perhaps by connivance fell into VOLTAIRE's hand This was the substance of it  "I have at last had the pleasure of considering at my ease this marvellous dramatic superfetation this second delivery of an abortion taken again into the womb of of its mother to receive fresh nourishment The formation however does not appear yet to me to be regular and I can discern nothing from the head to the tail but a number of disjointed and monstrous parts instead of a perfect and complete whole In short it is impossible to reconcile this sarago with common sense  Mariamne  is an inanimate doll that does not know what it does nor what it wants  Varus  is a hairbrain who takes his measures as stupidly on the Banks of the JORDAN as the DANUBF  Herode  with his politics is the silliest fellow of the whole troop  Salome  a miserable rascal who merits exemplary punishment and  Mazael  a clumsy rogue who so far from accommodating himself to the intentions of his master so injures and disappoints them that  Herode  if he was not as mad as the author ought to confine him within four walls"  He thus goes on at great length minutely taking the play to pieces with great humour and ability and then finishes by saying that when the construction and the writing are fairly estimated it is impossible to say whether the author has sinned most against reason or rhime    The next piece of VOLTAIRE was  L'Indiscret  a comedy in one act and in prose Its success is not known It was very probably written from some complimentary motive and with no great view to fame Nothing more appeared of this author till when he brought out  Brutus  It is very material to notice that when VOLTAIRE brought out this tragedy he had just returned from England wherespight of his affected indifference for the English poets his rank and jealous abuse of SHAKESPEAR whose genius was beyond his comprehension his unfair judgment of OTWAY sinking him below RACINE than whom he certainly wrote infinitely betterhe learnt in what way to rise in the dramatic art superior to the best of his countrymen This remains for subsequent discussion  In this tragedy VOLTAIRE completely overshot his mark Fired with the spirit of English liberty which with so much adulation he had in ENGLAND defined to be a medium between tyranny and democracy and which the Romans attempted but never could attain its essence so evaporated in his passage from DOVER to CALAIS that in  Brutus  written avowedly to promulgate the principles of British patriotism he introduced all the levelling sentiments of a republic and expected the French to tolerate under  a despotic monarch what would have revolted the English under a limitted one  The consequence was that the  parterre  expressed at the first representation of this piece the loudest indignation and when they heard the following lines from the mouth of TITUS  Je suis fils de BRUTUS et je porte en mon coeur  La liberte gravee et les Rois en horreur  there was a general tumult The piece however had its partizans and those it offended contented themselves with barely staying away from it It nevertheless so injured the reputation of VOLTAIRE that he did not recover it till he brought out  Zaire  which might be called the first complete tragedy in all its parts ever performed on the French stage  As I mean to draw up the most celebrated of those numerous authors who at this time attracted the notice of the public and make them pass along in the view of the reader I shall follow up VOLTAIRE with DE LA MOTTE a man of great genius and a most finished poet  DE LA MOTTE wrote for the French theatre the Italian theatre and for the opera and always  respectably but his poetic works and particularly his odes gave his fame the most substantial and permanent confirmation He was born at PARIS in and died in so that his whole public history may come in here  DE LA MOTTE from his earliest youth had a strong propensity to poetry and a remarkable talent for declamation This induced him to get by heart every thing that was celebrated in which he was assisted by a memory so quick and so tenacious that facts are averred of its effects almost beyond credibility  Among many instances adduced to prove that DE LA MOTTE in point of memory was a sort of prodigy the following is particularly worthy of notice A young poet repeated in a large company a tragedy which he had written DE LA MOTTE who was present listened with great attention and when he had heard it out told the young gentleman that it certainly had considerable merit but that he was sorry to find him so great a plagiarist The poet testified astonishment at this assertion  "This is well acted"  said DE LA MOTTE  "but to convince you that I am right I will now repeat to you the whole of the second scene in the fourth act"  This he instantly did and in a manner as animated as if he himself had written it The eyes of all the company were now turned on the young poet who thrown into a most awkward embarrassment knew not what to say when DE LA MOTTE took him by the hand saying  "Don't give yourself any concern young gentleman the scene in question is yours as well as the rest of the piece but it appeared to me so beautiful and so afleeting that I irresistibly got it by heart as you repeated it"    DE LA MOTTE was an extraordinary character He had scarcely made himself known but without any apparent cause he all of a sudden retired to the monastry of DE LA TRAPPE but the celebrated Abbe DU RANCE unwilling to deprive the world of a young man of such promise refused him the habit under a pretence that he was too young to sustain all the rigid and severe discipline of that austere order After this he attached himself to the theatre not without some casuistical qualms as to the propriety of how far his conduct was reconcileable to the duty of a true christian  But his conduct all through life was it must be confessed fanciful and irresolute Having passed a long series of years in composing most beautiful verse he finished by decrying poetry as an unnatural species of writing He compared versifiers to slightofhandmen who pass grains of millet through the eye of a needle in which exploit there is no other merit than the difficulty and to prove the truth of this assertion he turned his tragedy of  Oedipe  into prose which he had before written in verse This however drew on him a volley of epigrams which he was too much a philosopher to answer though the best of them was infinitely below the worst of his poetry but I  shall wind up his character after I have enumerated his pieces  The tragedies of DE LA MOTTE are  Machabees  performed in  Romulus  in  Ines de Castro  in and  Oedipe  in When DE LA MOTTE produced  Machabees  he kept himself aloof as the author In consequence of this the play was immediately attributed to RACINE but as the truth got wind those wise critics gradually pretended that upon maturer consideration they had found by comparing one author with the other that it could be written by nobody but DE LA MOTTE  ROUSSEAU was one of those who had been deceived He excused himself by saying that as there were no points no flowery ideas no flights no finesse in this tragedy he had conceived that it was impossible it should be written by DE LA MOTTE ROUSSEAU probably had forgotten that DE LA MOTTE knowing perfectly the different properties of lyric odes and other sanciful poetry he also knew the properties of tragedy    Romulus  was greatly successful and excited much curiosity both from the public and the different authors Parodies at the Italian theatre and the fairs were at that time the test of dramatic success  Romulus  was parodied at the Italians by DOMINIQUE under the title of  Arlequin Romulus    and at the puppet shew by LE SAGE and FUZELIER by the name of  Pierrot Romulus  The parodies however were damned and the success of the tragedy confirmed  Inés de Castro  had still greater success than  Romulus  Never piece attracted so many spectators and so much criticism  DE LA MOTTE being one day at a coffeehouse he presently heard a knot of these critics abuse his play when finding that he was unknown to them he joined heartily in abusing it himself At length after they were altogether pretty well glutted with decrying its merits  "What shall we do with ourselves for the evening"  said one  "Suppose"  said DE LA MOTTE  "we go to the seventysecond representation of this bad play"  It is written in verse but certainly too prosaic for DE LA MOTTE though he complied with the custom of other writers could never reconcile to himself that characters on a theatre ought to address each other in any other style of language than that in which according to their rank they usually speak  VOLTAIRE considered  Oedipe  as his  chef d'auvre  in point of poetry  "Take care"  said DE LA MOTTE one day  "that I don't put your  Oedipe  into prose"  "If you do"  said VOLTAIRE  "I'll put your  Ines  into verse"  This anecdote has given rise to an idea that  Ines  was written in prose    Oedipe  which piece DE LA MOTTE wrote in  verse against his own opinion had but little success for that very reason and when he turned it into prose it did not succeed at all This induced him to defend his conduct which it must be confessed he did very ably for indeed he was upon good ground VOLTAIRE replied to him and as he had a real regard for DE LA MOTTE used in his arguments every possible politeness and delicacy DE LA MOTTE under the pleasantest irony couched his arguments in the same terms and this called forth innumerable squibs levelled at these polite enemies Madame DACIER mixed in the dispute but disdaining VOLTAIRE's or any body's politeness this female ARISTOPHANES reprobated in unqualified terms every requisite of the drama but its barbarity which one should naturally suppose is not a requisite It finished by DE LA MOTTE's leaving the theatre  DE LA MOTTE wrote for the French theatre two comedies and five for the Italian theatre The subjects are principally taken from the Tales of DE LA FONTAINE or rather from those whence they were taken by him They are most of them performances of merit for indeed it was impossible for DE LA MOTTE to write ill but they are certainly the most inferior of his works His operas twelve in number are clearly upon the whole  the best of his dramatic writings for though as to the general requisites of opera writing QUINAULT stood certainly before all other French poets though far behind METASASIO yet for the true grand extended idea of lyric writing DE LA MOTTE was infinitely superior to them both of which his incomparable odes are an incontrovertible proof DE LA MOTTE's operas were composed by various musicians among whom were CAMPRA DESTOUCHES MARAIS COLASSE and LA BARRE  DE LA MOTTE was loved and esteemed both in public and in private the whole of his life His genius was brilliant his understanding commanding and his manners amiable to which his writings bear ample testimony They are the effusions of a great mind regulated by a found judgment Alike a stranger to rancour or adulation not a single line of satyric severity has escaped from his pen nor has he though his heart teemed with philanthropy and though it was his delight to praise in one single instance condescended to flatter  It must not be objected that his odes which are avowedly panegyric are flattery Great men and celebrated actions require from the poet strong and enthusiastic language The most luxuriant frights of fancy may be permitted and the most flowery fields of imagination traversed in search of suitable wreaths for the brows of heroes philosophers and legislators DE LA MOTTE in this has followed PINDAR and I know not in some instances that he has not equalled him    DESTOUCHES demands our next attention on whom it will be the less necessary to enlarge because almost the whole of his productions have been in one form or another exhibited on the English theatre and will therefore of course require an investigation in their place He was born at TOURS in and bred up to arms in which profession he so distinguished himself that he grew into great esteem with his superiors  In the DUC D'ORLEANS then Regent of FRANCE sent him on an embassy to ENGLAND where he was employed on negociations for three years and where no doubt he greatly improved himself as a dramatic writer his comedies though heavy and sometimes insufferably tiresome being constructed more upon the English plan than any thing French which had gone before them  Le Tambour Nocturne  in particular is almost a literal translation of the  Drummer    His works which are published in ten volumes consist of twentytwo comedies and some divertisements and detatched scenes His first piece  Le Curieux Impertinent  appeared in which was  followed before he came to ENGLAND by  L'Ingrat L'Irresolû Le Medisant Le Triple Mariage  and  L'Obstacle Imprevû  The first piece he produced after his return to FRANCE was  Le Philosophe Marie  DESTOUCHES when he was in ENGLAND married a young lady of a catholic family but as he was in a public capacity he conceived it proper to keep this marriage a secret This secret coming out by degrees in his family some of whom were offended the uncle in particular who wanted to propose to him another wife makes up the circumstances of the comedy all the characters of which are drawn from life It is by much the best of his plays  this was succeeded by  L'Envieux  and  Les Philosophes Amoureux  which are all that appeared of this author till  What DESTOUCHES ought principally to be commended for is his endeavouring to give the French stage a consequence that it had before been a stranger to but in cutting up frivolity he has lost sight of humour His principal character is always a colossal statue by the side of which the subordinate personages stand like mere pigmies and are totally lost in our contemplation of the grandeur and stupidity of the primary object which after all would no more attract our attention than any other monstrous figure did not some accommodating LYSIMON or GERONTE like a wild beastman play off its singularities and explain its extraordinary qualities  It must not however be denied that in DESTOUCHES there are many beauties in his intrigue he is happier than MOLIERE and in his moral more chaste than REGNARD for between these two he seems ambitious to place himself He is however too dry too sententious and if the observation may be permitted too wise and too regular He is generally without saillies or embellishments which when rigourously judged are sometimes frivolous and misplaced yet when judiciously introduced they enliven the mind and warm it to a more willing acknowledgement of the pleasure of truth  MARIVAUX whose writings claim the highest praise for their ingenious bold and meritorious tendency started like a true genius with a determination to become original He went however in some respects upon a false principal Having most uncommon powers of language and fancying his predecessors had exhausted all that it was possible to do with character he resolved to turn entirely to subjects of intrigue which in proportion as they admit of variety to infinity lose known and acknowledged manners and therefore wander out of of nature's sight  'Tis too much to attempt to analyze the heart  Pleasant traits pretty thoughts new situations agreeable repartees and lively sailies are all thrown away when they are used to betray motives instead of develop actions MARIVAUX goes for the applause of the mind instead of the heart the province of comedy is to command the applause of both Full of genius he exposes nothing but ingenuity certainly fraught with finesse with delicacy with grace and with sentiment but nevertheless frequently tiresome and often almost inexplicable The French are remarkable for saying a great deal without interest upon nothing MARIVAUX has the knack of making the nothing on which he says a great deal interesting  MARIVAUX brought out on the French and Italian theatres thirtysix pieces generally in three acts and in prose thirteen of which were performed before They seldom had success at starting and it was his usual observation that he considered it more flattering to his reputation that they should please on repetition than at first Many of them however never recovered the blow and it is probably owing to the extraordinary the inconceivable ingenuity they contain that any of them kept the stage for a length of time I shall say more on this subject when I shew that some of the English poets have read MARIVAUX as well as DESTOUCHES  Circumscribed as I am I must now take up authors in a much more summary way than either their merits or my wishes incline me LE SAGE FUZFLIER and D'ORNEVAL who ran the same career may properly be mentioned in this pl  LE SAGE claiming every way the preeminen  ▪ and being so well known in ENGLAND by G  ▪ BLAS and LE DIABLE BOITEUX it will be mo  unnecessary that I should enlarge on his genius and writings  LE SAGE wrote ten pieces for the French and Italian theatres and twenty for the fairs besides those he had a hand in together with FUZELIER and D'ORNEVAL They all go for a fair and lively exposition of folly and many of those performed at the fairs are either parodies of celebrated plays at that time performed at the regular theatres or neat satires on temporary subjects His pieces for the theatre are too much in the Spanish style except two or three which are admirably levelled at the reigning absurdities of those times of these  La Tontine  and  Turcaret  are the most remarkable  FUZELIER wrote at different times for all the theatres and brought out twenty pieces single handed and as many in conjunction with LE SAGE and D'ORNEVAL which last though he greatly  assisted those associates is not reported to have written any thing without them  It will be proper to mention DOMINIQUE ROMAGNESI the two RICCOBONIS and LE GRAND together for as they wrote respectively or in conjunction for the Italian theatres from subjects either taken from Italian canvasses or approved by them all it would be difficult to distinguish their separate merits There are nearly a hundred pieces to be traced in which all these had a hand  PANNARD PIRON CAROLET and others also contributed at this period towards the prodigious fund of amusement which attracted the attention of the public at the Italian theatre and the fairs while BOISSI LA FONT BOINDIN LA CHAUSSEE BEAUCHAMPS DE LA RUE  DE LA RUE who was DANCOURT's preceptor and who brought out two plays had as we have seen an aversion to the theatre It was this that induced him to reprove DANCOURT for his impiety in being an actor  "Ah father"  said DANCOURT  "I am afraid the only difference between us is that I am actor to the king and you are actor to the pope"  and others did their best to make a stand at the French theatre against VOLTAIRE DE LA MOTTE and  DESTOUCHES but as I have done with none of those mentioned in this chapter except DE LA MOTTE whose manners and whose merits were an honour to his country I shall as I go on resume such points concerning them as I may conceive likely to instruct or amuse the reader  CHAP VIII CONTINUATION OF THE FRENCH THEATRE TO  AS the works of VOLTAIRE now form the principal feature of the French drama I cannot do better than through the medium of enumerating those give every collateral particular relative to the other authors his cotemporaries for to speak particularly limitted as I am of every author and play that my documents furnish me with would be little more than to set down names and dates  Eryphile  produced by VOLTAIRE in had no success  L'ABBE DESFONTAINES an indifferent author but a troublesome critic predicted this and was therefore treated by VOLTAIRE in the grossest manner who among other things did not spare to call him an ass and an ideot but when the public voice verified his prediction VOLTAIRE who with the greatest pretended indifference was the sorest of all authors witness his letter to the Queen on the subject of this play when it was parodied under the title of  Semiramis  was guilty of a thousand meannesses to conciliate the favour of the Abbe which he at lenth effected  It was therefore withdrawn and  brought forward as we shall see under the title of  Semiramis  The changes necessary for the occasion were not very difficult for the two subjects are perfectly the same His next piece was  Zaire  a tragedy performed in of which I regret I have not room to speak the eulogium but a proper opportunity will occur when this performance under the title of  Zara  shall be spoken of as one of the ornaments of the English theatre  When  Zaire  first appeared a most invidious and contemptible report prevailed that VOLTAIRE had purchased it for two hundred pistoles of a certain Abbe MACARTY an Irishman who was first a Roman Catholic and afterwards turned Turk Nay even a certain notary was said to have drawn up an obligation for the sum I confess when I first heard of this circumstance knowing the imbecility and irresolution of VOLTAIRE's mind I dreaded he would have betrayed something like apprehension but was charmed to find that standing fairly up against the infamous calumny he treated it with the sovereign and inestable disdain it merited  This piece in addition to the popularity it atchieved for itself brought forward the famous DUFRESNE and the celebrated Mademoiselle GAUSSIN who performed the parts of  Orasmane  and  Zaire    Adelaide du Guesclin  brought out in was the next production of this author It had been performed before under the title of  Adelaide  and having had but mediocre success on either of these occasions it was as we shall see afterwards produced  under the title of the  Duc de Foix  One of the characters was called  Coucy  to whom another addressed himself thus  "Et tu content Coucy"  A man in the  parterre  instantly cried out  "coussi coussi"  a provincial admission of the Italian cosi cosi which signifies so so an expression particularly well adapted because on the Italian theatre by way of buresque it was often used by Harlequm    Alzire  appeared in The same engines were set to work to decry this piece as had been used to injure  Zaire  The real author was said to have been a man of the name of LE FRANC VOLTAIRE in reply to this calumny said that some person instructed as to the subject of his piece might have suggested it to Mons LE FRANC in which case he was welcome to treat it and if it proved better than that which he had submitted to the public he should be happy to forget the unkindness in proportion as he should be obliged to applaud the merit of the piece  "I shall always adopt this conduct"  added he  "for I don't like paper wars  A man of genius being told that VOLTAIRE was not the author of  Alzire    "I should be heartly glad if it were so"  said he  "for in that case the nation would boast of one more great poet than it had bargained for"  "  L'Infant Prodigue  appeared the same year with success It was written in verse It is said that if VOLTAIRE had not been afraid of the journalists he would have struck into prose It would have been a noble advantage if he had for there can be  no doubt but VOLTAIRE's prose is the best in the French language and he would in that case have completed DE LA MOTTE's laudable plan  Zulime  was brought out in We are told that this piece was considerably altered after it was out of VOLTAIRE's hands and to this circumstance is ascribed its having had but little success  La Mort de Caezar  a tragedy in three acts was brought forward in The characters are entirely men consequently the plot having nothing to do with love is rude and revolting Its success was in proportion  Mahomet  was performed for the first time in This idol of the French was withdrawn after the third representation by authority and the author informed that he would be denounced if he suffered it to be performed again VOLTAIRE however having employed all his credit Cardinal de FLEURY issued a new order for its appearance nevertheless the actors were afraid of incensing the Procureur General and it was kept back till when it came forward with most extravagant success and has always been considered by the French as the best written play in all the works of VOLTAIRE  VOLTAIRE asked FONTENELLE one day who was then upwards of ninety what he thought of  Mahomet    "Il est horriblement beau"  said FONTENELLE    Merope  came out in This subject had been treated by GILBERT in by CHAPELLE again by LA GRANGE CHANCEL and at different periods by other poets under various titles VOLTAIRE's play is beyond all question the best and its reception was equal to its merit  The pieces of DESTOUCHES after are  Le Glorieux La Fausse Agnes Le Tambour Nocturne Le Dissipateur L'Ambitieux et L'Indiscrette La Belle Orgueilleuse L'Amour Usé Les Amours de Ragonde L'Homme Singulier La Force du Naturel Le Jeune Homme a L'Epreuve  and two or three others Of all these the success was so uniform except in one or two instances that it will be unnecessary to say more here than that DESTOUCHES was deservedly considered as a very reputable author  DESTOUCHES generally lived in retirement on an estate purchased near MELUN His custom was when he had finished a piece to take it to PARIS and after it had been represented for the first time to return again into the country He died much beloved and respected at the age of seventy four  The remainder of the pieces brought out by MARIVAUX need not be particularized They consist of twenty two comedies and one tragedy  which was called  Annibal  many of which succeeded with persons of taste and discernment but were generally withdrawn after a time to form the delight of the closet where they are beyond measure charming MARIVAUX lived esteemed and died regretted at the age of seventy five  DE LA MOTTE DESTOUCHES and MARIVAUX were members of the French academy DE LA MOTTE succeeded T CORNEILLE DESTOUCHES was chosen in the place of CAMPISTRON and MARIVAUX was elected at the death of the Abbe de HOUTEVILLE  The preliminary discourse of DE LA MOTTE was answered by Monsieur de COLLIERES director of the academy After congratulating him on his filling the situation formerly occupied by the great CORNEILLE and since devolved to his brother who had by his dictionary and other works of utility proved himself worthy him who had been the admiration of the age in which he had lived Monsieur de COLLIERES in the liveliest terms assured DE LA MOTTE that his works spoke their own eulogium and that it was not more by the suffrages of the academy than by the general wish of the nation that he was called to hold the honourable situation the world were so well convinced he would adorn  DESTOUCHES was replied to by FONTENELLE who delivered a most masterly and eloquent harrangue certainly the eulogium of the King and the Cardinal de POLIGNAC rather than DESTOUCHES It was however wound up very powerfully and the academy were congratulated on receiving in their new member a substitute in comedy for what CAMPISTRON had been in tragedy  MARITAUX was addressed by the Archbishop of SENS who most delicately and adroitly excused himself for having been enticed out of the regular path of literature in which it had been his custom and his duty to walk by the fascinating inducements thrown out by the writings of the new academician He recapitulated the beauties in his works warned him against painting love too voluptuously and finished by giving him that tribute of praise which warm and sincere as it was he said  "was but the echo of the multitude"    St FOIX a most accomplished and elegant writer unfortunately for the cause of literature dealt in nothing but trifles trifles however only in size for in value they were inestimable St FOIX was too independent both in mind and circumstances to drudge regularly for the theatre otherwise there cannot be a doubt but he would have brought comedy in FRANCE to the truest perfection Full of novelty yet full of nature with a correct knowledge of every dramatic requisite and a most penetrating judgement to give those requisites effect his dialogue nobly simple agreeably playful and deliciously interesting the whole domain of Thalia seemed open to his view in which he was permitted to range for fancy and variety  He had the peculiar and masterly merit in all his dialogue of concealing the writer His characters uttered those sentiments with which nature  inspired them and uttered them in nature's language St FOIX had nothing to do with it Every thing seemed extemporaneous because it was full of the heart and what immediately arose from honest truth and conscious reflection These and many other requisites St FOIX most eminently possessed which if they are so evident in the specimen he has given written for amusement at his hours of leisure his productions must have been valuable indeed had he devoted his whole time to them and this is particularly confirmed by the fertility of his invention and the strength of his discernment for in twentytwo pieces he gave to the French and Italian theatres though every plot is peculiarily original and greatly interesting no two plots have in any respect the smallest resemblance of each other  The pieces of St FOIX before were  Deucalion et Pyrrha Pandore L'Oracle L'Isle Sauvage  and  Les Graces  and now I shall leave the works of FAVART ANSEAUME MARMONTEL SEDAINE and many other celebrated writers whose productions about this period first made their appearance together with all that remains to be said of those whom I have not yet done with to give a brief account of the opera such particulars of the Italian theatre as may conduce to round my general history of it to speak of actors of dancers of  musicians and of farce writers after which I shall regularly wind up my history of the French stage with a further account of their best writers and such necessary remarks on them and their merits as may serve hereafter for a comparative elucidation of the dramatic art in ENGLAND  CHAP IX THE OPERA  HAVING brought the opera forward to the death of LULLY and the secession of QUINAULT I shall as briefly as possible give such further particulars concerning it as may serve to assist my future account of it when I come to speak of its establishment in ENGLAND Brief indeed I must be for besides those operas already mentioned I reckon more than two hundred good and bad that were brought out from their establishment up to the year  In these operas authors of all descriptions had a hand from T CORNEILLE DE LA MOTTE MARMONTEL ROI DANCHET and even VOLTAIRE to LE ABBE PELLEGRIN BERNARD MONDORGE BRUERE and CAHUSAC down to many others of much more inconsiderable talents Some of the musicians I have already named to these may be added ROYER MATHEAU MOURET MONTECLAIRE and many others who were at length completely eclipsed by RAMEAU It should not however be forgotten that the celebrated PHILIDORE  whose music was almost as famous as his chess composed an opera called  Ernelinde  written by POINSINET  RAMEAU who was born in was induced by his passion for music and his thirst after improvement to visit ITALY very early in life  It is not my intention to speak of music at length till I treat of its progress in ENGLAND I shall then show how it took root and grew in every country and that it always arrived to the truest perfection whenever it was transplanted from the garden of ITALY  There he had formed his taste upon PERGOLESE JOMELLI GALLUPPI CORELLI and all that string of celebrated composers who exactly at that time had brought music to the highest degree of perfection It must be understood however that it was not by their instruction but merely by listening to their admirable compositions that he became so astonishing a musician Never did he receive from any man a single lesson on harmony Nature and his own strong mind were his preceptors and so well was he taught by such insallible instructors that he at length became a harmonic legislator a musical LYCURGUS to the justice of whose laws the whole tribe of composers have implicitly bowed obedience  The French were so enthusiastically attached to  that dull monotonous style of music introduced by LULLY that it was with the utmost difficulty RAMEAU could prevail upon even the most indifferent writers to supply him with words and he was fiftyfive years of age when he promised the Abbe PELLEGRIN a poor resource by the by a large sum of money to write  Hypolite et Aricie  which was performed in It was at first damned but being again brought forward at the instance of some persons of discernment it so opened the eyes or rather the ears of the nation that a new character was from that hour given to the musical taste of the French  This second representation was in a great measure owing to the noble conduct of PELLEGRIN the author and CAMPRA RAMEAU's professional rival PELLEGRIN struck with the effect of the music tore the instrument to pieces which RAMEAU had given him as a security for his money saying he pitied the taste of the French and that he was but too happy to fall in such company and CAMPRA being asked what he thought of the music said there was good music enough in  Hypolite  to serve for ten operas This was told to the Prince de CONTI who asked if these were really his sentiments He answered that the declaration was no more than truth and justice for that RAMEAU was certainly born to eclipse their whole tribe This prediction was completely verified for no other musician had brilliant success after this event The consequence was that those who happened to possess good sense and honesty like CAMPRA gave way without murmuring but the rest among whom were MONTECLAIRE and MOURET became a prey to envy and despair MONTECLAIRE attacked RAMEAU on his violating the rule of harmony but happening by way of shewing his candour to praise the only passage in the opera of  Les Indes Galantes  written by FUZELIER in which the rules of harmony were actually violated he was so completely laughed at that he never ventured afterwards to speak of RAMEAU or his music As for poor MOURIT it is a literal fact that he went mad and employed himself during his highest paroxysms in singing a chorus in the second act of  Castor et Pollux  written by BERNARD and composed by RAMEAU begining with these words  Qu'an feu du tonnerre  Le feu des enfers  Declare la Guerre  After this authors were solicitous enough to write for RAMEAU MONDORGE BRUERE CAHUSAC and AUTREAU were all employed by him At length VOLTAILE who has told us he went out of his way to oblige a man of such talents wrote for him  Le Temple de la Gloire  which was followed by  Pygmalion  written by DE LA MOTTE and composed by LA BARRE in but reset by RAMEAU in After this he had the good fortune to be assisted by the pen of MARMONTEL who wrote for him four pieces by which time the French opera had arisen to its highest degree of persection  After all the opera in France admirable as the talents of RAMEAU were never equalled or even approached the Italian opera The vast theatres of VENICE MILAN and other places gave a style and a magnificence to the scenery greatly beyond the scenery of the French The advantage of  setting Italian words to Italian music such music especially as was produced by the joint labours of so many wonderful composers again threw the French opera at an immense distance In short in nothing but the dances by the way a mere apendage to the opera have the French excelled but in these they have ever excelled all EUROPE  A celebrated English dancer called on the famous MARCEL at PARIS who desired to have a specimen of his abilities The Englishman could not please MARCEL Every thing was tried and all to no purpose At last  "  tenez mon ami  "  said he  "  en voila assez  "  "the fact is you jump very well in LONDON but as to dancing my good friend it is only to be found in PARIS"    The performances at PARIS derived great respectability from their regulations by the order of the king After the death of LULLY who had at least the merit of being a strict disciplinarian the opera relaxed greatly from the regularity and good order that had been before kept up This induced the king in to issue an arret consisting of eighteen articles which enacted that the director of the Royal Musical Academy should chuse the best possible performers both vocal and instrumental and also performers for the ballets no one however to be received without the approbation of the inspector general That a school for music and dancing should be established where all performers should be taught gratis  That the different merits of the performers being ascertained and by them acknowledged they should receive such parts as were provided for them without murmuring upon pain of being deprived of a month's pay for the first omission and of being discharged for the second Their duty both towards one another and towards the public is next very properly pointed out the portion of the profits equitably appropriated a fund established for such as may have performed fifteen years not as a charity but as a reward for past services and another fund by way of encouraging emulation to be at stated periods divided among all those who may have best discharged their duty towards their employers and the public  It is next ordered that during all recesses the performers without distinction shall be put upon half pay afterwards that the authors and composers of all operas shall be paid in proportion to their success on every night as far as thirty representations provided the opera is performed so many nights in succession The examination of all operas to be impartial and no measure either for or against authors musicians or performers of any description to be taken without a memorial drawn up and well attested for the perusal of the inspector general who shall audit all accounts and regulate in conformity to the will of the king all matters respecting the management of  the opera the accounts of all denominations to be constantly settled the last day of every month  Persons were in consequence of this new regulation immediately appointed and it was without variation ever afterwards kept up In the appointments stood thus REBEL at the head of the musical academy FERRET and PARANT principal conductors of the singing school the two GARDELS regulators of the dancing school among the principal male singers were GELIN LARRIVEE DURAND LE GROS MUGUET TIROT and LAINEZ the principal female singers were LARRIVEE ARNOULD DUPLANT BEAUMESNIL ROSALIE DURANC CHATEAUNEUF and GIRARDIN and there were about thirty others employed in choruses and other inferior stations  VESTRIS was the ballet master who was also principal dancer with GARDEL and DUBERVAL Next came a train of figurants then the principal women who were PESLIN GUIMARD HEINEL and ASSELIN and then the figurantes and supernumeraries amounting to about fifty The list was closed by the names of those who performed in the orchestra to the number of sixtyfour so that the whole company including all descriptions of persons employed must have consisted of at least two hundred  CHAP X ITALIAN THEATRE  I SHALL now look after such authors and other persons as were concerned in the Italian theatre and interested in that conduct and those circumstances which grew out of it after its establishment in  It has been seen that the actors at the fairs having the advantage of performing entirely in French became very formidable rivals of the Italians who were in conjunction with the French comedians continually making interest to throw every possible rub in their way The public however tired of seeing them thus persecuted took the matter up and after it had gone through a number of hands some of whom had been ruined in the contest FRANCISQUE and LALAUZE were glad to sell the concern to PONTEAU who wrote a number of things in conjunction with FUZELIER PANNARD CAROLET GALLET and L'AFFICHARD and he had influence enough to obtain from the musical academy  permission to call his performance  L'Opera Comique    From this time forward these whimsical pieces grew mo  e and more into repute A history or an anecdote describing any of their former persecutions a parody of a bad tragedy in short any temporary whim dramatized by LE SAGE and his followers who all wrote with wonderful pleasantry was a thousand times more welcome to the public  han those pieces half French and half Italian sung through the nose or those entirely French spoken through the nose at the regular theatres The consequence was they became too formidable and in were suppressed with this qualification however that the performers should be incorporated with the Italians  The inferior description of performers nevertheless such as had been interlocutors at the puppet shews or ropedancers or tumblers or in short any of those for whom it was impossible to find any employment in a regular theatre still hovered about the fairs and were permitted or rather suffered to perform there and on the  Boulevards  such drolls and farces as were within their capacity with a view to assist and relieve those tricks and seats they exercised as their proper profession  Among these the famous NICOLET so well known upon the  Boulevards  cut the most conspicious figure This man fairly took up the ancient farces of which I shall not have a better opportunity to give an account than this They were certainly the origin of that prodigious number of proverbs and pieces in one act which have spread themselves through FRANCE either in private societies or on the stage They were without doubt originally the productions of the  Children of Sans Souci  and at that time they contained probably either the burlesque of the Greek satires or the asperity of the Roman or perhaps a mixture of both but being neglected by them for works of greater magnitude when they joined the Confraternity of the Passion these farces were suspended and would have been altogether lost if some of the buffoons had not afterwards restored them who not being sufficiently informed to imitate Greeks and Romans made a shift to invent a great deal of drollery by ridiculing the folly of their own countrymen  Of these PATHELIN TABARIN GUILLOT GORJU GAUTIER GARGUILLE GROS GUILLAUME and TURLUPIN were the principal The last three were journeymen bakers and friends from their infancy It is difficult to ascertain whether these farces which they performed upon their own  account were exhibited during any recess or whether they left the company to which they belonged but it is certain they were in the early part of their lives all actors in HARDY's plays and the other exhibitions of that time  For the purpose of performing these farces they took a small tennis court near  le porte St Jaques  which they converted into a theatre The price of admittance was two sous and six deniers They had such success that the company of the  Hotel de Bourgogne  complained of them to Cardinal RICHELIEU who being fond of every thing dramatic sent for them to perform before him in the  Palais Royal  which was then called his palace They satisfied the Cardinal so well that he would not forbid their performance  The subject of the farce they were said to have performed before the Cardinal was as follows GROS GUILLAUME who is represented to have been as thick as he was long and who often by means of a dress with hoops stretched across formed himself into the figure of a hogshead was in this farce supposed to be the wife of TURLUPIN who jealous of GARGUILLE is determined to cut her head off He seizes her by the hair with a drawn sabre in his hand while she upon her knees conjures him by every thing dear to him to abate his anger She reminds him of their past loves how she rubbed his back when he had the rheumatism and how charmed she had always been when he wore his flannel night cap but all in vain Will nothing move thee cries this amiable female in the last despair Oh cruel Think on the bacon and cabbage I fryed for you yesterday Oh the sorceress cries TURLUPIN I can't resist her She knows how to take me by my foible The bacon the very fat's now rising in my stomach Live fry cabbage and be dutiful  This so emboldened them that they  grew more and more scurilous and personal till GROS GUILLAUME in one of their farces counterfeited a certain magistrate so perfectly that he issued a warrant to take them all up GROS GUILLIAUME was put in prison where he shortly afterwards died His companions made their escape but it is said they had been such sworn brothers and friends all their lives and had promised so faithfully to stick by each other that when GARGUILLE and TURLUPIN heard of their friend's death they fell ill and soon afterwards followed him They were very old the youngest of them being nearly eighty  This sketch may serve to shew whence the farces performed on the  Boulevards  originated the humour and style of which MOLIERE DANCOURT and others had very frequently in view and indeed all the writers for fairs These having selected all the valuable parts nothing remained for the exhibitors on the  Boulevards  but grossness and filth which certainly they have ever thrown about pretty profusely  The most indecent nonsense of our merry Andrews and puppet shew men may give some idea of it    The names of Harlequin Pantaloon Scaramouche and the rest of the pantomime characters are supposed to have been either the real or adventitious titles of those who first performed them The original Harlequin is said to have been a young performer among the Italians at the time of HENRY the third who being retained by the president HARLAY was called by his companions according to the Italian custom of giving the master's name to the servant Arlequino a name that DOMINIQUE GHERARDI CARLIN and others ever after went by The names of Mezetin Pantaloon and several of the rest are said to have been real and thus whatever might be the subject or whatever the scene you saw the pieces always performed as it were by one family This bad custom spread itself through all their comic writings which we see stuffed with Damons and Gerontes and Lysimons and Erastes out of number instead of those appropriate names by which we distinguish the variety of characters that are introduced in our comedies  After the junction of the Italian theatre with the comic opera they mustered very powerfully CAMILLE an admirable Pantaloon brought with him his daughter a most accomplished and beautiful woman  "A large volume"  says my author  "could not contain half the verses that were written  in her praise"  She was an actress as well as a dancer and admirable in both capacities CLAIRVAL was an excellent singer and a sound actor CARLO VERONESE also brought out his daughter CAROLINE who performed the Colombine that is to say the chambermaid for all the Harlequins at the Italian theatre were valets and all the Colombines chambermaids she had almost as many verses written in her praise as CAMILLE Some of them by MARMONTEL who was in love with her  To Madame FAVART whose merit in public and whose character in private life cannot be spoken of too highly I lament that it is not in my power to do the justice she merited She sung charmingly and performed with delicacy truth and sentiment She was a perfect musician and played admirably on the harp All these qualifications her husband availed himself of in the characters she performed which he wrote purposely for her and to which she gave so much grace and nature that her manner has been ever since the standard of imitation In her private life she was a tender wife and mother and a faithful and affectionate friend  THEVENARD and THEVENAU were two admirable singers THOMASSIN was a good Harlequin OCTAVE who acted danced and played upon eight  instruments was a great favourite and STICOTTI was an excellent Pierrot but the arrangement of the Italian theatre in which I shall now bring forward will shew the state of the company and how well it was regulated  It is premised say these laws that the company are under the immediate protection of the king and must render account to him of their conduct through the superintendant of his  menus plaisirs  and the gentlemen of his chamber The organ through which all applications reports and appeals are to be conveyed to be composed of three performers called  Semainiers  or weekly inspectors chosen by a majority out of the company These inspectors are to have different departments The first is to take care of the registers to examine the receipts and disbursements and to act in every respect as guardian and treasurer He is to convoke all assemblies and regulate with the consent of a majority of the company the business of the week which having been properly digested is to be announced by the bills to the public and without good cause to the contrary literally carried into execution  The second inspector is to examine the state of the company the stock list of performances the merits of the performers their forwardness as to the discharge of their duty to see after the state of the  decorations to take care at performances and rehearsals that every decorum is observed and that nothing is neglected by actors singers dancers painters or members of any other description that may render their exertions worthy the patronage of the king and the encouragement of the public  The third inspector is to watch over the conduct of the other two to render an account of every thing that passes to the intendant  Des Menus  and to instruct the company as to what orders he receives in consequence from court and whether the proceedings of the company are approved or disapproved of by the king  These inspectors are to remain in office three weeks and during that time to serve respectively each office the whole company on every Saturday morning in full assembly receiving an authentication of their fidelity in the discharge of their several trusts and being at liberty to examine their conduct on which they may pass a vote of thanks or censure each performer voting according to the order of his or her reception in the company at which assembly the king's pleasure is to be made known and resolutions taken as to their future plans and operations at all times strictly adhering to these regulations  Distributing of parts forseits recompences over  and above the common appointments and first appearances are regulated as equitable as every thing else but these the duty of the performers and other particulars I shall reserve till I lay them by the fide of the English regulations I cannot however pass by the treatment of authors  All authors who think proper to send pieces to the theatre are to direct them to the second semainier who is to report the instructions which those authors shall think proper to send with their performances to the company If the author wishes to be concealed they are to observe inviolable secrecy If it should be the opinion of the company that the piece ought to be read notice is given and the author invited who may either read his piece himself or chuse that performer from the company who he conceives will do it the greatest justice The company are forbid to applaud or condemn and the author is requested after the reading is over to retire that the opinions of the actors may be given without restraint  The debate then begins and it is put to the vote whether the piece shall be received or not with the determination the second semainier acquaints the author who if he thinks proper may insist upon altering his piece and submitting it to a second reading and if then he should remain dissatisfied  he may ultimately insist through the third semainier of appealing to the intendant of  Des Menus    The profits of the author are for a first piece a ninth of the house during the whole of the first run which shall not be interrupted upon any account till the receipt shall twice together be under a thousand livres The profits on pieces of two acts are a eighteenth and on pieces of one act a twentyfourth of the receipt subject to the same regulations  When the pieces were musical the profits were still the same but they were shared between the author and composer    In the principal performers where men CARLIN ZENNUZZI COLALTO LA RUETTE CLAIRVAL CAILLOT VERONESE TRIAL CAMERANI and others women DESGLANDS LA RUETTE BERARD BEAUPRE TRIAL ZANERINI BILLIONI COLOMBE and others Actors retired on pensions from the king DESBROSSES THOMASSIN TOUVOIS GAILLARD DEMERY ROUSSEL DESORMERY MOREL and LECLERC Actresses BACELLI GAULT LEFEVRE GAILLARD and DU FAYEL Ballet master DE HESSE Principal dancers men BERQUELAURE and HAMOIRE women LEFEVRE and HAMOIRE and sixteen figurants and figurantes The orchestra contained twentyeight performers  CHAP XI AUTHORS AND THE FRENCH THEATRE TO THE DEATH OF VOLTAIRE  CREBILLON will now stand forward who in and at the age of seventy four brought out  Catalina  after labouring at it more than twenty years It was greatly admired and in particular the three first acts notwithstanding the turn VOLTAIRE had given to tragedy There were however in it some incongruous things and it would not probably have obtained that notice from the public it met with had not Madame POMPADOUR taken it under her protection and presented the actors with superb dresses for all the characters  Le Triumvirat  came out in at which time CREBILLON was eighty It had very respectable success and though his enemies among whom may be reckoned his son spoke of it as a plagiary from the rest of his works and among others from a tragedy called  Cromwel  which had been fordidden to appear it certainly did no discredit to his reputation  Whenever the younger CRIBILLON was in company he made a point of decrying his father's works even to his face  "How now"  said a friend one day  "shall you who have been able to produce nothing but fairy tales and other frivolous rhapsodies pretend to criticise a man who has done honour to the age he lives in who has written so many tragedies and other works equally meritorious and ingenious"  "Well"  said young CREBILLON  "and which are the best of his productions"  "It would be difficult"  said the friend  "to ascertain which is the best but it is easy to see that you are the worst"    CREBILLON was received at the academy in and delivered his preliminary discourse in verse He was very much respected through life At his funeral attended all the public bodies and private individuals who were esteemed for literary pursuits Every mark of honour and respect was paid him and the king at his private expence ordered for him a handsome monument  Among the remaining authors exclusive of those already mentioned who wrote for the stage during the life of VOLTAIRE at the French theatre we find FONTENELLE BRET MOISSY PALISSOT BELLOY FAGAN GRESSET LA GARDE MERCIER DE MORAND and a variety of others and at the Italian theatre FAVART ANSEAUME SEDAINE and many more  FONTENELLE whose arduous and meritorious  labours did so much service to the cause of literature in FRANCE was the nephew of the great CORNEILLE Among his dramatic pieces which alone are entitled to notice here and which were written like those of LA FONTAINE rather for amusement than fame are two or three of considerable merit Not one however can be called perfect There reigns every where in them a powerful and persuasive style always ingenious and often seducing but there is an affectation of explaining self evident sentiments different from other authors a weakness of expression that injures the strength of the sentence 'Tis a painted giant a Hercules dressed like a  petit maitre  a fault in short that every judicious reader will see and ought to complain of for unfortunately the faults of a great man are always dangerous because they are always imitated and what is worse are easily imitated by those who have not capacity to imitate his perfections  I wish I could with equal propriety enlarge upon the other publications of FONTENELLE which are replete with instruction and delight and by which through a long and laborious life he deservedly kept a brilliant reputation To his honour however and the perpetuity of his fame the literary world are competent to speak his eulogium and to enumerate all the particulars of those distinctions  which were heaped on him by the suffrages of the French Academy the Academy des Belles Lettres and the Academy of Prussia of all which societies he was a valuable member He died at PARIS at the age of a hundred in  BOISSI wrote a great number of pieces for all the theatres but they are negligently and slovenly written and on mere chit chat subjects therefore though they served well enough to expose and correct temporary folly they have nothing in them from which may be expected a permanent reputation His first pieces after a time were generally reduced to farces and sometimes to one act  The actors took this liberty so mercilessly with BOISSI that he was not always very much satisfied  "Why zounds"  said he one day  "if my plays are to be hacked and hewed in this manner what shall I do to have a piece represented in five acts"  Write it in eleven said an actor  and after the whim or the absurdity they were meant to laugh at had gone by they were heard of no more  BRET produced several comedies for the French theatre which are written with an elegant facility natural just and give proof of no mean knowledge in the dramatic art PALISSOT speaks of this author in very handsome terms and praises him in  particular for his pieces called  La Double Extragance  and  Le Faux Genereux  in which there are certainly some admirable circumstances The first of which he says  "is written in the true style of comedy and the other is full of great tenderness and real interest"  MOISSY who produced eight or nine pieces generally with success was an easy elegant and natural writer His style is flowing and lively He was accustomed to mix with the highest characters in real life which enabled him to paint genteel manners with great truth of colouring but as there is in genteel company generally too much vapidity he often wants force humour and interest  About the time that MOISSY brought out his comedy of  Les Deux Freres  BRET produced another called  Les Deux Saeurs  Neither of these plays had great success  "What shall I do"  said BOISSY to a friend  "with my two brothers"  "Why"  said the friend  "I think you can't do better than marry them to BRET's two sisters"    PALISSOT was a writer of considerable eminence He attempted a tragedy at nineteen which was received as a work of great promise The situations were interesting and the style was natural and pure but when he considered the extreme difficulty of entering the lists with VOLTAIRE he  very sensibly turned his hand to comedy where he had a larger field to range and where he might more freely exercise that pointed and satyric vein which best suited his genius  Having made up his mind he determined to become another ARISTOPHANES and that he might be the more conspicuous he went to the very fountain head for materials His first comedy that became popular was called  Les Originaux  and brought out at NANCY in LORRAINE in In this play without mincing the matter he boldly drew the character of ROUSSEAU not individually as to his person or his manners but as his mind appeared in his writings The adherents and disciples of ROUSSEAU who were numerous particularly in that town presented a memorial to the king of POLAND duke of LORRAINE and of BAR in which they prayed vengeance on the head of the author The storm was violent but it was short PALISSOT triumphed and this opposition only served to make him more popular and encourage him to pursue a career for which his victory had shewn he was so qualified  In PALISSOT brought out  Les Philosophes  which contained some most cutting and pointed satire at all those who were advocates for the fanciful  and dangerous doctrines of ROUSSEAU VOLTAIRE and other authors of that stamp  PALISSOT in his Memoirs says that being honoured with the countenance and support of two ladies of high rank to whom he dedicated a work finding those ladies libelled because they protected him and seeing very plainly that it was the intention of the libellers to compromise the matter with the ladies by inducing them to transfer their favour under an idea that his arguments ought not to be rated in opposition to theirs he conceived it his duty to take the matter up For this purpose as the flanderers were public characters indeed VOLTAIRE is supposed to have been concerned in it he thought he could not more completely do public justice than by bringing them on the stage and offering up their dark opinions and their invidious philosophy as a sacrifice to truth to reason and to decorum  Its success was beyond every thing that had been before represented on the French theatre The actors through the interest of VOLTAIRE and the rest were induced to raise a clamour against it and Madmoiselle CLAIRON at the head of a party entered a protest alledging that it ought not to be performed because it contained personalities The drift of this however being plainly seen upon an appeal an order was issued for its representation  The accounts of the French authors say that all the works of CORNEILLE RACINE MOLIERE CREBILLON and VOLTAIRE put together never attracted such a concourse of spectators or excited  so many cabals as this single play  VOLTAIRE wrote PALISSOT several letters upon this occasion in which through an affected gaiety appeared the most poignant chagrin A literary man said upon this occasion that VOLTAIRE would never forgive PALISSOT for throwing off his livery by which it should seem that PALISSOT enlisted under VOLTAIRE and would have remained his disciple had he not been so greatly  ed against him  It being clearly discovered however that the parties against it were interested persons or suborned at their instance the favourers of the piece took up the quarrel as their own and after a long and warm altercation its triumph was decided It must however be confessed that it was a bold undertaking for this piece did not attack merely a single character infamous or ridiculous but a sect numerous powerful and celebrated  By some means or other however PALISSOT was silenced for though we hear of a comedy called  L'Homme Dangereux  into which he is said to have thrown as much vigour and as much humour as into  Les Philosophes  and another called  Les Courtesannes  of a still severer cast nothing more of his worth notice was actually represented  BELLOY a very proper author to follow PALISSOT gave like him one piece of uncommon  celebrity It was called  Le Siege de Calais  and its very extraordinary success was entirely owing to its being the first French play purely historical With very great art and management he contrived to make not only the times which he portrayed resemble the times in which he wrote but the personages  The Marshal BRISSAC was aimed at in one of the principal characters of this piece and he was very proud of the distinction The part was performed by BRIZARD and the Marshal meeting him one evening cried out  "BRIZARD if you should happen to be ill let your comrade send to me to play your part"  This tragedy had such astonishing success that the author was called for four times on the first night of its representation and once on every other during its run  It is curious to remark that this rage was carried to a most ridiculous height Whenever the author was called for the whole theatre received him with shouts of applause and never dismissed him till they cr  ed out with once voice  Vive le Roy et Monsieur  DE BELLO    It was performed three times at court the author was presented in person to all the royal family he dedicated his play to the king who gave him a gold medal ordered the controller general to pay him a considerable sum and exhorted him to continue writing upon French historical subjects  Le Siege de Calais  was performed in every town  throughout FRANCE the inhabitants of CALAIS presented BELLOY with a gold box and placed his portrait in the  Hotel de Ville  the military voted him their thanks from the generals down to the ranks and the celebrated Count D'ESTAING caused the play to be printed at St DOMINGO and distributed through all the French West Indian Islands and yet after all posterity will know but little of BELLOY except this event It was one of those freaks in which the French fancied they were patriotic for his  Zelmire  stolen from METASTASIO and VOLTAIRE and but little regarded  Titus  performed but once  TITUS who is renowned for saying whenever any day passed that he had not the happiness of doing some benefit to mankind  "I have lost a day"  has the very same expression in this tragedy on which a wag remarked when the piece was damned  "  Titus perdit un Jour Un Jour perdit Titus  "    Gaston et Bayard  which was received with reluctance by the actors and indifference by the public and  Pierre le Cruel  which was performed at ROUEN because they would not hear it out at PARIS are but poor vouchers for the same of BELLOY especially as the two last were produced after the  Siege of Calais    FAGAN an author of considerable merit but whose indolence would not suffer him to avail himself of the genius he possessed produced for the French theatre the Italian theatre and the fairs  about twenty pieces They are full of inequalities they are a mixture of perplexed ingenuity in short they are lumps of ore containing gems which his idleness had not permitted him to separate and polish  Le Rendezvous  and  La Pupille  had the best success  GRESSET wrote one tragedy and two comedies for the French theatre which were performed with success but being unwilling to engage in that warfare which generally attends writing for the stage he is said to have suppressed several others as far as it went certainly a national loss for GRESSET was a good writer His poetry is natural and harmonious fertile in images rich in epithets and never overcharged  LA GARDE who wrote three or four pieces with success was remarkable for being the first who regulated the mode of dressing on the stage and established what the French call  du costume  He was originally intended for the church and had even taken the habit The enchanting voice of Madmoiselle le MAURE however enticed him away from the singing at high mass to the singing at the opera He was well calculated to give directions in the management of the theatre and to superintend decorations to set off which though he was no mean poet his writings were generally intended  MERCIER an author of uncommon merit and whose regard to the reputation of the stage was sincere and patriotic and supported with great judgment and good sense wrote twelve or fourteen pieces for the theatre only two of which however were performed in PARIS These were called  Natalie  and  La Brouette du Vinaigrier  His other pieces were performed in almost every part of FRANCE They are not comedies but plays a sort of representation as I have already contended nearer to nature than mere tragedies and comedies containing circumstances and sentiments that go more immediately to the heart because they relate to the social duties  MERCIER as well as DE LA MOTTE was a great advocate for prose because the mind ill accommodates itself to the pomp of verse in tender and interesting situations and prose is the language of nature His style is uncommonly beautiful strong decided powerful yet simple unaffected and easy His lowest characters utter noble great and philosophic sentiments without stepping beyond the truth of nature or displaying more than what every heart can feel and therefore what every tongue can express  MERCIER was certainly a wonderful writer  The reader must not confound this MERCIER with the author who wrote  Le Bonnet de Nuit  They are brothers and as I understand both valuable characters but a little like the two CORNEILLE's very distinct from each other as writers  and particularly for the stage His knowledge of effect is perfect and critical and he has no character no incident no situation that is not at once a part and an embellishment of the piece His drift is at all times to inculcate the mild duties of benevolence and to sooth the mind to sober and substantial happiness rather than rouse it to giddy and transient delight but all such authors are considered as reformers and the stage is a dangerous spot to attempt at innovation I shall have occasion when I speak of MOORE and LILLO to resume this charming writer  DE MORANDE known more by his singularity than his writings brought out six pieces of different descriptions which might have succeeded tolerably had he not perpetually headed cabals and set himself against the works of other authors who of course revenged themselves whenever any of his productions appeared He was a strange excentric character and one of those who are mistakenly  called no men's enemy but their own for persons of this description in general are pests to society His pretensions to dramatic fame are very slender his pieces being generally an incoherent jumble not however in some places without original merit  MARMONTEL whose admirable writings are of the most finished kind not only brought out several pieces himself but furnished to other authors a variety of admirable subjects His tragedies though respectable are by no means equal to his other plays  In MARMONTEL's tragedy of  Cleopatra  which was a good deal hissed a famous mechanic had constructed an asp so artfully that it seemed perfectly alive As it approached CLEOPATRA the eyes sparkled like fire and it began to hiss After the scene was over one of the auditors asked a person who sat near him how he liked the piece  "Why faith Sir"  said the other  "I am of the same opinion of the asp"    Venceslas  which as we have seen was only an alteration from ROTROU seems to have determined MARMONTEL to stick to comic subjects  The regard the public retained for an old author of eminence prevented their receiving this piece from the hands of MARMONTEL with the warmth that had been expected To encourage this indifference a variety of circumstances concurred the source of which seems clearly to be traceable to VOLTAIRE who was probably jealous that MARMONTEL should write tragedy LE KAIN VOLTAIRE's firm and intimate friend stirred up the actors to reject the corrections of MARMONTEL who among all the company had no support but Madmoiselle CLAIRON On her LE KAIN was instructed by his principal how to be revenged and when the piece was performed  vious to its public appearance he got his whole part altered by a Mons COLARDEAU so that though the speeches retained the sense originally given them the expressions were so different that CLAIRON whose great excellence was an attention to those who were speaking to her was quite thrown out On the other hand the audience supposed the fault to be with MARMONTEL and threw all the odium on him He appealed however LE KAIN was reprimanded and ordered to expunge all that COLARDEAU had written▪ Egged on by VOLTAIRE who rejoiced that the prohibition had gone no farther he determined to abide by this injunction to the letter When therefore the piece came to be performed on the theatre he took out certainly all that had been introduced by COLARDEAU but instead of substituting MARMONTEL's alterations he supplied the deficiencies from ROTROU himself The consequence was that CLAIRON was as much at a stand as ever and MARMONTEL hissed once more for what he had not written Being then author of  Du Mercure  he appealed to the public and inserted a letter written by one of the actors which was answered by LE KAIN who was again accused of somenting the whole quarrel and thus appeal succeeded appeal till the public were tired of the subject and MARMONTEL certainly ill treated though many of the arguments were greatly to the honour of ROTROU of whose reputation his advocates affected to be very tender resolved never again to tread tragic ground  for which  certainly he was more qualified  La Bergere des Alpes Le Huron Lucile Silvain Zemire et Azor L'Ami de la Maison  and others are all in the true style of the comic opera and written with the same delicacy and nature which pervade his  Moral Tales  a work that has been held in such high estimation by the world  DIDEROT claims a right to be mentioned here though he wrote but two comedies one of which  Le Pere de Famille  had considerable success  Le Fils Naturel  did not succeed so well The truth is DIDEROT and MERCIER wrote too naturally too critically true too accurate for the multitude The situations of their characters were happy they drew the passions in their most perfect attitudes and coloured them with a fidelity through which all their various shades were discoverable DIDEROT however much more than MERCIER and it is upon this account that he is less skilful in the construction of his pieces for while MERCIER introduces no incident however striking but what naturally leads to one general interest DIDEROT by attempting to create perpetual interest involves his subject in perplexity But he would have reformed this had he written more for the stage The world however will find their consolation in those other works in which he has improved and embellished literature  We come now to consider the productions of FAVART ANSEAUME and SEDAINE whose pieces critically ascertained the true province of the comic opera which however never had settled into absolute regularity till MARMONTEL's Tales gave an idea of the exact nature of what their plots should be formed  Ninette a la Cour La Chercheose D L'Es+prit  Le Coq de Village La Rofiere de Salency La Bohémienae  and many others written by FAVART boast that natural and simple regularity of which MARMONTEL's  Annette et Lubin  and other productions first gave the idea  Mazet Les Deux Chaisseurs et la Laitiere L'Ecole de la Jeunesse La Clochette  and  La Coquette de Village  of ANSEAUME are again of this description and so are  Le Roi et le Fermier Rose et Colas Blaise le Savetier Le Jardinier et son Seigneur  and  On Savife Jamais de Tout  of SEDAINE  Each of these pieces consists of some pleasant subject on which the play and management of the circumstances turn and out of which such incidents arise as beget interest and lead naturally to a just and proper denouement The songs in the pieces of these authors are well written but upon the whole those of FAVART are rather the best There are many other pieces of this nature written by these and other authors and some of them have been on the English stage among which are  La Fee Urgelle Les Moissonneurs Le Tableau Parlant Le Deserteur  and  Richard Coeur de Lion  I shall therefore find a better time and place to speak of them  To return to VOLTAIRE  Nanine  a comedy taken from  Pamela  was brought forward by VOLTAIRE  in This subject was so admired and RICHARDSON so celebrated in FRANCE that the general cry was to have it on the stage LA CHAUSSEE tried his hand at it and failed so did BOISSI VOLTAIRE however succeeded greatly  PIRON pretended not to like  Nanine  or perhaps did not really like it for heaven knows it is dull enough VOLTAIRE asked him why he did not hiss it  "'Twas impossible"  said PIRON  "a man cannot hiss and yawn at the same time"  though it must be confessed he has treated the subject very insipidly  Semiramis  was first performed in This tragedy having been stolen from CREBILLON and once before as we have seen brought forward without success the whole hue and cry of wits hunted it down without mercy in consequence of which its reception at some of the early representations was again doubtful It gained ground however and afterwards drew a prodigious concourse of spectators to the theatre who did it the justice it really merited for though there are faults in the plan yet it is strongly written and some of the situations are very affecting  VOLTAIRE did himself no service in this business by introducing the ghost of NINUS after he had ridiculed the ghost in  Hamlet      VOLTAIRE's next tragedy was  Oreste  It was performed once and withdrawn for eight days after which with the help of many corrections it did tolerably well  Rome Sauvée  came out in it was respectably received To these succeeded  Le Due de Foix  which also gave satisfaction It is impossible to deny that these three tragedies are greatly written and that whatever may be their faults they confess the hand of a master in every line A true poet possessed of a male and nervous mind  L'Orphelin de la Chine  and  L'Ecossaise  the first performed and the other in will come in among the articles of the English stage  Tancred  also performed in had considerable success The subject called forth all the strength of VOLTAIRE's talents and it must be confessed he has well employed them but  L'Ecueil du Sage  a comedy produced in was received very coldly and had it not been written by VOLTAIRE would not have been heard through on the first night  Olimpic  a tragedy brought out in had better success but by no means such a reception as some of his former pieces  Les Scythes  performed in is a work of considerable merit The judicious critic will easily  discern that it is not only written by a poet but a philosopher It did not however succeed greatly at first being like many of VOLTAIRE's plays written in a hurry and taken back for correction  In one of the public prints of that year are these words  "We understand that Monsieur VOLTAIRE has sent the actors a tragedy in his manner called  Les Scythes  and informed them at the same time that he wrote it in twelve days The actors to be even with him have returned it with an humble request that he will take twelve months to correct it"  His next piece  Les Triumvirs  was damned owing it is alledged to his keeping back his name Certainly it did not deserve so severe a  ate and it is probable that had he according to custom acknowledged its faults and corrected them it might have been made an acquisition to the theatre  The last piece but one by VOLTAIRE was  Sophonisbe  performed in This tragedy was nothing more than the alteration already spoken of from MAIRET or rather THEOPHILE VIAUD from a subject that had been so frequently treated by other authors It certainly had merit but had so little novelty to recommend it that its success was inconsiderable which perhaps determined VOLTAIRE to leave the theatre for though we find among his works eleven pieces besides those already enumerated not one of them was performed except at his private  theatre in GENEVA These are of different discriptions but many of them have great merit  Les Guebres  is written with astonishing force and grandeur  Samson  an opera is most admirably designed and charmingly written  "A comedy called  Samson  says VOLTAIRE was a great while performed in ITALY It was translated in FRANCE by a man named ROMAGNESI This piece was brought out at a place which was anciently the palace of the Duke of BURGUNDY It was printed and dedicated to the Duc D'ORLEANS Regent of FRANCE In this sublime performance HARLEQUIN SAMSON's valet keeps a turkeycock at bay while his master takes the gates of the city of GAZA upon his shoulders In this subject was attempted to be revived at the opera embellished by the music of RAMEAU but it was not permitted for as the turkeycock had no place in the piece it was considered as a very serious business and improper to be represented and in other respects they were glad enough to mortisy RAMEAU who had too much merit not to excite envy Nevertheless at the same time they made no scruple of performing  Jeptha  from the Old Testament and the  Prodigal Son  from the New"  and in  Socrate  there is some of the sweetest prose particularly the love scenes that can be conceived  There was however another piece which VOLTAIRE brought with him from FERNEI when like a hare he came to PARIS to die This was a tragedy called  Irene  and it was performed at the French theatre during an interval in which he flattered himself he should recover from the severe illness with which he had been attacked on his coming to PARIS and  indeed afflicted some time before  At this time VOLTAIRE himself was acting a most miserable farce On his arrival in PARIS he was visited and enquired after with more solicitude than if he had been an ambassador or a minister of state Nothing was spoken of but VOLTAIRE Nothing that could flatter his excessive vanity was omitted Every syllable he uttered was cherished like the prophesies of an oracle His bon mots his sallies his most trifling expressions were retailed in all the journals and in all public companies Happy they who caught from him a complacent glance a condescending nod or a gracious smile In the mean time some individuals who also knew how to act farces resolved to make his folly contribute to their interest Among these was a certain Abbe GAULTIER a namesake at least of a farce actor already spoken of This man who formerly had been a Jesuit thought he could not better ingratiate himself with the Archbishop of PARIS than by bringing about VOLTAIRE's conversion to the church after he had been so long considered as a notorious aposlate For this purpose he determined to enter the lists with the actors and the philosophers and combat with them lustily for the soul of VOLTAIRE He pestered him with letters and the more he was tormented with bodily and mental infirmity the more he harrassed him till at length the poor poet with all his fear of eternity before him was reduced to the most pitiable state of pusillanimity and irresolution One minute he sent for the priest the next he denied himself to him Now he wrote a recantation of his errors presently he retracted it The Abbe in the mean time was under the necessity of putting every art in practice to carry his point for he had DIDEROT D'ALEMBERT MARMONTEL and others to manage who wanted the poor philosopher to die in peace In proportion however as the patient's apprehensions encreased he gained the ascendancy A full and complete abjuration of all the crimes VOLTAIRE had committed against the christian religion was drawn up couched in terms equivalent to a confession that all that he had ever written was full of lies a terrible prohibition for an author to destroy the credit of a long life of study and its fruits contained in an hundred volumes by the single dash of the pen This recantation was to be published in all the newspapers in EUROPE and it contained in particular a very artful condition which was that as it had been reported that every precaution would be taken when he should be near his end either by threats or denunciations to make him confess and sign whatever might privately serve the purposes of the church or its ministers and that therefore all he said or did under such restraint ought to go for nothing he not only abjured all knowledge of these or any other similar insinuations but protested that whatever he should confess and whatever he should sign would be the unbiassed effect of full conviction and a due sense of the manifold crimes he had committed together with a necessity for a sincere a contrite and an unequivocal repentance The conditions were hard and it required as much management to get them accepted as boldness to propose them but nothing could intimidate the Abbe He found he had hooked his fish and it was his business to play with it properly in order to bring it safely to his hand He enjoyed his amusement however with rather too much wantonness for just as he was on the point of gaining the reward of his dexterity death broke the line and away went his prey to the bottom In short just as VOLTAIRE had manifested an apparent consent for an absolute one he never manifested to these hard terms he fell into a delirium and died before he had received extreme unction or done any other thing necessary to his being considered as a christian and therefore though statues and mausoleums were erected to his memory and he was deified at the theatre the church refused him the rights of sepulture nay what is very extraordinary they refused to take their fees for fear of contamination  This was the consummation not of his glory as he fondly called it but of his vanity Before the piece began BRIZARD the oldest of the actors entered the box  and placed a crown of laurel upon his head which he with an affected modesty attempted to return at the same time exclaiming  "What will you overwhelm me Will you kill me with excess of  glory"  The tragedy was then represented after this VOLTAIRE's statue was placed on the stage and while the actors and actresses crowned it with laurel and performed a most ridiculous and extravagant ceremony the poet received all the honours of an apotheosis  Whether this excess of glory or the excessive importunities of the church and his friends on one side who wished him to die a christian or the followers of his doctrines on the other who were solicitous that he should remain what they called a philosopher to the last would have atchieved the victory it is hard to say the conflict certainly accelerated his end Pride weakness vanity mortification regret fear and a thousand other warring passions agitated and convulsed his frame till at length a compassionate delirium came to his relief and he died a warning to speculatists and an awful example of unavailing compunction This event happened May when he was nearly eighty four years of age  The church having forbid that the remains of this extraordinary man should be buried in consecrated ground his relations with difficulty got leave to transport the body to FERNEI but they managed to procure its burial at an Abbey of BERNARDINES at SCELLIERES in the diocese of TROYE in CHAMPAIGNE  to which place the news of the prohibition had not reached The bishop of TROYES however got intelligence of the business and sent to forbid the interment but the order came too late it was therefore agreed that the body should not be taken up but the bishop laid the chapel under an interdiction and the prior was deposed  A wit upon this occasion wrote a distitch which may be thus translated  Here of grave monks among a holy nest  Rests he who never suffered monks to rest    To go over the large field of VOLTAIRE's productions would be both unnecessary and improper They are in all recollections and all libraries and we have nothing to do here with any thing but his dramatic productions These though there is scarcely any thing original in them are the best his country can boast a strange but a true declaration VOLTAIRE's judgment was strong faithful and penetrating to a degree of wonder and his recollection was so vivid that his memory served him in the place of genius Thus he was any writer he pleased and better than the writer himself because he could divest himself of partiality The observation I confess is against all rule all example but it is nevertheless true in VOLTAIRE who on every possible subject could make you receive that as his  own which he did nothing but borrow and embellish and to prove that this is exactly what he thought and felt his own words are that  "originality is nothing but judicious imitation"  He moulded CORNEILLE RACINE and CREBILLON to his own fancy and whether the forms he thought proper to make them wear were single or complicated likenesses the copies were always better than the originals In  Brutus  he portrayed CORNEILLE in  Zaire  RACINE and in  Mahomet  CREBILLON  The critics of his own country have gone farther and advanced that in the  Mort de Caesar  he has excelled SHAKESPEAR but as this would open a new scene of contention for which I am not sufficiently forward I shall dismiss the subject till I have an opportunity of letting SHAKESPEAR speak for himself when I may probably shew that close application to the be  uties of SHAKESPEAR enabled VOLTAIRE in great measure to excel his countrymen  Yet were neither of them injured  "A literary thief"  says a wit  "should always murder his man for what use is life to him after he is become a cripple"  but whether VOLTAIRE stole a feature from one or a limb from another or in what way soever committed his depredations still the persons plundered sustained no injury their like the polypus and their pockets like the purse of FORTUNATUS still retained their original proportion and value  "My rivals"  said he  "accuse me without  mercy of having pillaged both the ancients and the moderns forgetting that they do the same thing The fact is we all seek for ornaments which may best embellish the subjects we treat and if they could steal to as good a purpose as I do my now superior roguery would excite no envy and thus I should hear nothing of their abuse"  To go further into this would be not only to involve these observations in a review of the numberless disputes cavils and heart burnings from which owing to insatiable and inordinate vanity he was never free but also of those authors actors booksellers academicians priests statesmen in short every possible description of person with whom he was eternally some way or other in hot water I must therefore I own unwillingly take leave of a subject which I shall hereafter have opportunity collaterally to resume with saying that the tragedies of VOLTAIRE which as specimens of erudition are correct elegant and classical as models of dramatic construction are masterly artful and judicious and as lessons of morality are beautiful winning and exemplary cannot fail to ensure him a permanent literary fame while great and extensive knowledge keen and penetrating judgment and perfect and refined taste are objects of admiration  CHAP XII MUSICIANS ACTORS REGULATIONS AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE FRENCH STAGE  FROM the moment RAMEAU reformed the music of the serious opera the strange trite unmeaning jigs that had been dinned in the cars of every frequenter of the comic opera and every passerby in the streets began to assume something like melody and while the style of the more important works of PERGOLESI GALLUPPI and their cotemporaries made up the grandeur of French music regulated by RAMEAU the Venetian Ballads and the other lighter music of the Italian Serenatas and Intermezzos changed the complexion and gave a delicacy to the Vaudvilles  DUNI following the example of RAMEAU improved the comic opera as RAMEAU has improved the serious opera He was afterwards followed among many others by MONSIGNY by PHILIDORE and at length by GRETRY at which time French music had gone beyond its strength and the string was stretched till it cracked  DUNI was chaste and correct but he seemed to compose tremblingly lest he should be thought an innovator MONSIGNY and PHILIDORE had more spirit and catching fire like RAMEAU from the Italian school threw that genius into a blaze which only wanted such a spark to illuminate it From these and from their imitators came all those French Minuets Gavottes Allemandes and Jigs many of which in the Ballad Operas and Dances made up the delight of the English from thirty to forty years ago At length appeared PICCINI who though a composer of great ingenuity was really an innovator This man by strangling melody with accompanyment first taught the English to despise the simplicity of GALLUPPI and afterwards went to FRANCE where he stunned his auditors out of the beauty of RAMEAU MONSIGNY and PHILIDORE till unfortunately meeting with his counterpart in GRETRY the French ever capricious chose to be surprized rather than delighted and their musical taste became so vitiated that now they have no musical taste at all  Without going over the requisites in which the French suppose the merits of their actors to consist and which had better be considered upon a comparison with the English actors I shall content myself at present with saying that though they call  BARON the French ROSCIUS and speak with rapture of many of their performers yet they never fail in the same breath to extol GARRICK above all actors ancient and modern  Indeed little more than declamation could be expected from the representations of characters who discoursed upon their most common affairs in rhime It is notorious that before  Merope  was performed tragedy was spoken in a manner little short of recitative and acted with almost the regularity of a minuet If a character was to be saved from a precipice he might break his neck and welcome if he had not patience to stay till his preserver had gone through all the dancing positions Rage grief love and pity were all spoken in the same cadence and danced in the same measure  A trait of nature in Madmoiselle DU MESNIL broke the charm In  Merope  she saw her son in danger and fancying herself the character she represented threw into her face all the agony of a despairing mother and darting across the stage cried out in a frenzy of tenderness and apprehension  "Barbarian he is my son"  But we shall have leisure to speak of their general merits at present let us talk briefly of them particularly  From BARON sprung either immediately or collaterally many of the best French actors He married Madmoiselle LE NOIR sister of THORILLIERE and Madame DANCOURT His son who has been already spoken of died young but he left behind him a son and two daughters who were all performers of merit the son in particular retired with a pension  DANCOURT appears to have been a sound actor but his great merit lay in training his company in which he manifested the strongest good sense He read remarkably well and knew how to teach to others the beauties of those authors whose works were confided to his care He was continually considering in what manner he might render the actors respectable in the eyes of their fellow citizens  LOUIS the fourteenth paid DANCOURT particular attention He frequently read his pieces to the king in his closet and one day as he exerted himself a good deal the room being very warm he felt himself suddenly ill on which the king ran instantly to the window and threw it open to give him air Another time having some suit to prefer to the king he encountered him as he was coming from high mass and retreating as the king advanced he nearly tumbled down a staircase that he had forgot was behind him at which the king caught him by the arm saying  "I applaud your zeal for your company and think your demand so reasonable that I shall comply with it especially as you plead their cause so respectfully but I don't see why your complaisance should make you break your neck"  The president HARLAI did not think DANCOURT and his company entitled to so much consideration When at the head of the troop he went to carry alms for the poor he acquitted himself handsomely of his commission and made a brilliant speech HARLAI was at the head of the Bureau DANCOURT took the opportunity of enforcing that the charity of the actors ought to exempt them from excommunication but he was cut short by HARLAI  "DANCOURT"  said the President  "we have ears to hear you and hand to receive your alms but we have not tongues to answer you"    In having spoken of POISSON as an author it was impossible to avoid giving an outline of him as an actor His principal merit was in representing comic parts and in particular the part of CRISPIN and other valets in that style He was very much admired by the court and LOUIS the fourteenth gave him many proofs of his favour and liberality POISSON had two sons who performed with some reputation One of them left behind him two volumes of plays some of which had tolerable success  DUFRESNE was an excellent actor but he was a curious character By always sancying himself the king or the statesman he represented he was miserable when after pulling off his trappings he could discover nothing but an actor born for the contempt of the public and fated to be excommunicated  The pride of DUFRESNE was insufferable  "I am"  said he to a friend  "blindly followed extolled adored How Only on the stage Is this happiness  "A popular error Sir"  "Why I would prefer the state of being a gentleman of an ancient race living comfortably in his family mansion even with no more than twenty thousand crowns a year and surrounded with but a dozen servants    It is said that in the hands of BEAUBOURG and others who succeeded BARON the art of acting had degenerated but that when DUFRESNE appeared be restored all its excellence with added graces of his own  We will pass by among the men LA NOUE who though he inherited but few requisites from nature was an actor of great general merit LE GRAND who though a good actor and by no means a bad author was neither a BARON nor a MOLIERE MONTMENY who was merely carressed as the son of LE SAGE and QUINAULT who as well as a good actor was a passable musician and many others and we will hurry over among the women the names of JOUVENOT who retired with a pension GAUSSIN who was the original ZAIRE LE COUVREUR an elegant and accomplished woman and an admirable actress in tragedy MAUPIN who was an excellent actress who in partiality to her own sex was a perfect SAPPHO who frequently  was mistaken for a man and who sought a duel and set fire to a convent the three sisters of QUINAULT neither of which was destitute of merit DUCLOS who was many years celebrated in tragedy DUBOIS who retired with a pension DANGEVILLE in whose praise for forty years all the journals all the histories of the theatre all the dramatic annals were so lavish even to the quantity of several volumes these and many more we are constrained to pass by that we may take a view a very transient one however of that celebrated set of actors and actresses who kept up the reputation of the theatre during the reign of VOLTAIRE and who were upon its establishment in the year  LE KAIN who was the dramatic  eleve  and the intimate friend of VOLTAIRE had many difficulties to surmount before he stood a chance of success Both his figure and his voice were against him but by a most extraordinary and lively sensibility after a greal deal of art and perseverance he overcame all these natural defects His acting was like a well painted scene the touches were mere daubing but the effect was astonishing  AS LE KAIN has been presumptuously by some authors considered as superior to GARRICK probably out of compliment to VOLTAIRE who considered himself as superior to SHAKESPEAR I shall have a better opportunity when I speak of our ROSCIUS of condemning those gentlemen through their own words  The whole of this  actors life was consecrated to VOLTAIRE nay that he might be complaisant to the last though but fortynine years of age the actor left the world within a few weeks of the poet  PREVILLE was certainly an admirable actor through all the round of comedy and it is natural to suppose by all the accounts we have of him that he was the best the French stage ever knew It was ever the custom to keep a French performer close to his  role  and as we say once a captain always a captain so one might say of a French actor once CRISPIN always CRISPIN But PREVILLE performed every kind of comic part and always happily His merit alone was the cause of their reviving almost all the comedies of MOLIERE and to the new characters which were written whether FREEPORT in  L'Ecossaise  FIGARO in  Le Barbier De Seville  MICHAUD in the  Partie de chasse D'Henry IV  or any other of these various characters of which he stampt the reputation it is impossible to deny but that he had as much good sense as versatility  I am happy to allow this and shall hereafter allow him much more when in its place I shall nevertheless shew PREVILLE greatly overmatched by KING    MOLE performed in hard honest blunt cha+racters  with great truth and justice He was a different figure and much more a Frenchman but those who recollect YATES may from that recollection form an idea of MOLE's acting I do not suppose the  Misanthrope Le Homme Singulier Le Glorieux  and other parts of that description were ever so respectably performed  BELLECOUR who was originally a painter and a scholar of WANLOO left the brush for the buskin He first however appeared in tragedy but his own good sense pointed out the true bent of his talents and he stood high in reputation in as a comic actor  There is some similarity between this actor and BANNISTER by whom however BELLECOUR is infinitely excelled as will hereafter be shewn    BRIZARD was an actor of considerable merit The advantages of a noble and graceful figure and a clear and powerful voice were heightened in him by a susceptible mind a strong understanding and a correct education He was born to represent the heroes of the great CORNEILLE and perhaps in  The Roman Father  and indeed all other descriptions of dignified tragedy no French actor has gone beyond him  BRIZARD seems to have been a mixture of BOOTH QUIN and SHERIDAN  He enjoyed many years a splendid reputation  and then retired to a beautiful retreat where he built himself an elegant house and filled it with pictures of his own painting  DUGAZON an actor of gaiety and address followed the steps of PREVILLE running however more into caricature When PREVILLE retired with his wife which happened at the time the theatre lost BRIZARD DUGAZON got on wonderfully and being named Professor at  De L'Ecole Royal de Declamation  he attained a very high situation in his profession  DUGAZON though a much more superficial actor conveys a strong idea of WOODWARD    DESESSARTS seems to have been in comedy something in the style of what BRIZARD was in tragedy by no means however his equal for though the Lisimons and the Gerontes of the French are parts that require good sense and a critical understanding yet they do not want such power and exertion as the old men in tragedy There was however an amiable and benevolent manner in DESESSARTS that gave great respectability to those kind of characters and though his acting was not the prominent feature of the picture yet it was the happy middle tint without which the picture could have had no prominence at all  DAUBERVAL AUGE BOURET DALAINVAL  and MONVEL were all actors of respectability Having however gone beyond my prescribed bounds I shall for the present let them pass by and speak of LA RIVE an actor of the highest celebrity who seized the dramatic crown from the head of LE KAIN LA RIVE profiting by the instructions of the incomparable CLAIRON and a long attention to the indefatigable labours of LE KAIN came on the stage at once an accomplished actor  Nature that had done but little for LE KAIN had done every thing for LA RIVE His figure voice manner were not only correct and engaging but they were precisely what those requisites should be in an actor They were in themselves interesting but under the controul of that mind which actuated them they were irresistable LA RIVE with these advantages gave an added force to the splendor that tragedy had acquired under LE KAIN LE KAIN having every thing to acquire laboured with the instructions and assistance of VOLTAIRE and his own strong mind and excellent understanding till he attained perfection almost in opposition to nature while LA RIVE instructed by CLAIRON studied and imbibed the perfection of LE KAIN and trusted to nature to perform the rest  In speaking of the principal French actresses I  shall begin with Madmoiselle DUMESNIL for though VOLTAIRE says he was charmed with CLAIRON till he saw superior merit in DUMESNIL yet it is certain that the latter performed in PARIS in and that CLAIRON except in some few trifling parts which she acted at the Italian theatre was not celebrated till the very year when DUMESNIL astonished the public by a display of extraordinary talents in  Merope  DUMESNIL had a stronger mind and more nature than CLAIRON CLAIRON more art and management than DUMESNIL One declaimed with judgment the other uttered with feeling Upon the whole I know not if the reader can have a better idea of them than by a recollection of Mrs CRAWFORD and Mrs YATES in ALICIA and JANE SHORE  Madmoiselle RAUCOURT and Madame VESTRIS properly follow DUMESNIL and CLAIRON The first was an impassioned and enthusiastic actress who is said to have given to  Medea  and other bold and violent characters a spirit and a warmth that had never before been thrown into them the other who was the scholar and intimate friend of CLAIRON kept close to her style and manner in which she often equalled and sometimes excelled her Madmoiselle HUS was an actress in a more extensive style but not so excellent as either of the others  She was well received however both in tragedy and comedy  The leading comic actresses were Madame BELLECOUR Madame DUGAZON and Madmoiselle CONTAT Madame BELLECOUR continued on the stage a great number of years and was always received with the greatest applause and admiration The names of PREVILLE and BELLECOUR were inseperable they constantly performed in the same pieces and with the same reputation Madame DUGAZON performed incomparably characters of simplicity not that this was her only merit for parts of more intelligence where deportment and demeanour were more essential and which were distinguished by art and cunning received at her hands every justice the most sanguine author could wish and if in PREVILLE and BELLECOUR there appeared a faint resemblance of KING and ABINGTON in DUGAZON and his wife might be discerned a likeness of WOODWARD and ELLIOT  As for Madmoiselle CONTAT she performed universally in comedy and undertook the characters that had been personated by Madame PREVILLE Mlle DANGEVILLE and Mlle D'OLIGNY just as Mad DUGAZON succeeded Mlle LUZI and Mlle FANIER I should with pleasure pay a more elaborate tribute to her merit  as well as to the rest of those whose names will presently appear upon the establishment at the year but that I have already exceeded the bounds I had prescribed myself for a display of the stage in FRANCE  The regulations of the French theatre were extremely similar to those of the Italian theatre In the king revoked all former laws and established new ones more to the interest and comfort of the performers who in the same manner as the Italians possessed the property and divided the profits after submitting to such just and necessary provisoes as were very sensibly and equitably laid down for them  These were drawn up entirely upon the same principle and carried into effect in the same manner as the others The semainiers treasurers and all who were entrusted with the regulations were obliged as before to submit their conduct to the Intendant  Des Menus  to be reported for the inspection of the king who took them immediately under his patronage So that to be further particular would be only to repeat what has been seen already In the company stood thus  Actors LE KAIN BELLECOUR PREVILLE BRIZARD MOLE DAUBERVAL AUGE BOURET  DALAINVAL MONVEL DUGAZON and DESESSARTS Actors retired on pensions BELLEMONT PONTUEIL COURVILLE SEGUIN and REYMOND Actresses DUMESNIL DROUIN BELLECOUR HUS PREVILLE MOLE DOLIGNY LUZI FANIER SAINTVAL DUGAZON VESTRIS LA CHASSAIGNE and RAUCOURT Actresses retired on pensions BONIOLI and St GERVAIS  Composer and ballet master DESHAYES first dancer DESNOYERS principal dancers GUIARDELLE VICTOR and HENRI First female dancer CONSTANCE CHOLET principal female dancers ADELAIDE SOPHIE and NOZIERE To which were added six figurants and six figurantes and six supernumeraries The band consisted of twentyfive performers  Thus have we taken a view of the French stage from its commencement to the time when it had attained the highest pinnacle of its reputation from which moment it has ever since gradually declined This subject is equal to a much larger scope and extent than I have been able to afford it otherwise I might have been more just to a greater number of authors musicians actors and others whose various merits and reputations deserve a more competent though not a more impartial historian  We have seen however enough to shew through a long serious of years genius and merit struggling with every kind of difficulty and the most meritorious exertions offered up as a sacrifice at the shrine of caprice We have seen one Cardinal turn actor and another fidler We have seen Kings and Princes dancing at the Opera and we have seen the consistent French with the King Queen and Royal Family at their head shed tears at the same play yesterday in the form of a tragedy at the theatre and to day laugh at it in the form of a droll at the fair We have seen priests transform themselves into actors and use nonsense and obscenity in the pulpit and we have seen actors in good sound sense ridicule priests on the stage  VOLTAIRE instances this very humourously in a letter to the Duke DE LA VALLE where he insists that the Mysteries which were performed in the sixteenth century were not so indecent or so full of impiety as the sermons of the priests who under the sanction of preaching in Latin had opportunity of being as brutal as they thought proper To prove this he thus translates a passage from a sermon of the CORDILIER MAILLARD in which the priest means to admonish the fashional le ladies of those times who wore embroidery  "You say you are dressed out according to your conditions All the devils in hell fly away with your conditions and you too my fine ladies You may take it into your heads to tell me that your husbands do not give you all these fine ornaments and gorgeous trappings but that you earn them by the labour of your bodies Thirty thousand devil fly away with the labour of your bodies my good ladies"  We have seen dancers  tygers and flying horses trample upon genius taste and literature In short we have seen LA SERRE a miserable bookduster triumph over the great CORNEILLE PRADON a supercilious dunce and a pliant tool conquer the tender RACINE and DU BELLOI who for subscribing to inordinate French vanity was first honoured with every mark of distinction and afterwards left to die in extreme indigence obtain a complete victory over the truly celebrated VOLTAIRE  Let us now turn our eyes to ENGLAND  BOOK IV ENGLISH STAGE TO SHAKESPEAR'S FIRST PLAY  CHAP I TENDENCY OF THIS WORK  THE English reader will now see that I have so long kept him at a distance from his native country only that it may be the more dear to him on his return The traveller who has crossed seas and traversed empires to seek for objects of wonder and admiration cherishes the recollection of the pleasure and instruction he has received only in proportion as it fits him for enjoyment in the bosom of his family  So if I have endeavoured in ATHENS to trace the dramatic art from the rude bards at the time of THESEUS to the polished writers at the fall of GREECE if I have described exotic manners transplanted  to ROME and there pining through a sickly and rickety existence if I have deplored the buffooneries of ITALY where the heterogeneous faragoes of the Romans were caricatured if I have wondered at the astonishing fertility and redundancy of the Spanish drama like a tree too luxuriant to be pruned and charged with too much fruit to ripen if I have smiled at the boorish farces of the Dutch and if I have given more at length the origin and progress of the French stage in which so many men of extraordinary abilities greatly distinguished themselves I have done this to prove upon a comparative review the superiority of our theatre at home  If I held up AESCHYLUS LIVIUS ANDRONICUS and CORNEILLE it was to place SHAKESPEAR upon higher ground if I instanced ROSCIUS and BARON it was to shew the preeminence of GARRICK and this motive has been my guide in every instance nor have I shrunk from the best commendation I could procure for authors actors musicians or any other of those descriptions of enterprizers who in so many ways are necessary to promote the success of a theatre because I fear not to enter the lists with them all clad as I am in English armour  But though I intend to dispute the subject point  by point I do not mean to pay my country so ill a compliment as to contend for superiority in those subordinate requisites which are the mere trappings the sumpter horses of the drama While these are decorous and keep their station in the back ground let them relieve which they will meritoriously the nobler attractions of the stage speaking the propriety of its conductors and the good sense of the audience But when the pageant becomes the object instead of the hero I call it no longer the triumphal entry of ALEXANDER but of his elephants Let the stage have dances let it have scenery let it have spectacles but never let these trench upon the rational pleasure and the solid instruction conveyed by tragedies and comedies In the first let the French excel be the other the province of the English  A French dancer in the reign of Queen ANNE after he had returned to FRANCE pretty well loaded with the spoils of this country heard a great deal from report of HARLEY the famous Earl of OXFORD and of his being in great favour with the Queen  "Well now upon my soul"  said he  "I am astonished at it I found him the stupidest fellow I ever met with why Sir I had him ten years under my hands and never could teach him a single caper"    Upon this ground I start and since it has been asserted with great confidence by the writers of other countries that the dramatic art arrived to no perfection  in ENGLAND till it had been perfected by all its neighbours and since our own writers have very tamely acquiesced in this calumny I shall for the first attempt of this kind begin my task by endeavouring to rescue the English stage from so much obliquy and shew that we are in every thing antecedent to the French and perhaps every other people but the Spaniards and that there are vestiges of the dramatic art traceable in this country long before the fall of the Roman empire  As the authorities from which I shall collect the leading features of this work will of course be very numerous I shall for many reasons beg to decline perpetually citing them They will naturally contain a thousand contradictions and my business will be while I divest myself of the prejudices which influenced those authors as they wrote to form the fairest and most rational conclusions that can be deduced from their arguments Were I to adopt any other conduct the names of STOWE SPEED MALMESBURY BEDE PERCY PARIS and I am sure at least fifty others foreign and English would be for ever occurring and the work thus flufled with authorities would wear the appearance of a string of marginal notes or a column in Doctor JOHNSON's dictionary The reader however sets that it may be necessary for the sake of elucidation sometimes to adopt a contrary conduct    CHAP II CONJECTURES CONCERNING THE DRAMATIC ART IN BRITON BEFORE THE ROMAN CONQUEST  WITHOUT examining whether this island ever was a part of the Continent or by what other means it became peopled it is impossible not to concur in a belief that the Britons were originally Gauls But if it be allowed only that they had a free communication and intercourse with the Gauls it is abundantly enough to establish a proof that they imported their amusements as well as their merchandize and if the Gauls who were clearly a motley people collected from all nations adopted the manners studies and pleasures of the Egyptians the Greeks and the Romans how is it possible that the Britons could avoid imbibing the same propensities  It is not pretended that the Druids were originally British on the contrary they are considered as an itinerant body who insmuated themselves among the Gauls the Germans and the Britons and who probably  came originally from ASSYRIA and EGYPT into such countries as would harbour them and as they have been considered in this part of the world in the same light with the Gymnosophists among the Indians the Magi among the Persians the Chaldeans among the Assyrians and the Philosophers among the Greeks it is very unlikely that the instruction they came to impart was so austere as entirely to preclude amusement  Indeed that this was one part of their mission there cannot be a doubt They consisted of four classes priests augurs instructors of youth and poets Here we have clearly the bards who sung to their harps the acts and atchievements of heroes and whether it was among the Britons they first established this art or brought it soonest to perfection it must certainly have been in high esteem for the word bard if we may rely on a number of authorities is purely British and derived from bardus which signifies a singer  We have histories of the Welch bards and the Irish bards and if there were only by way of authority that astonishing specimen of uncultivated genius the poems of OSSIAN written in the second or third century who can deny the eminent poetic talents of the Scotch bards and upon a consideration of this  how naturally will the names of HOMER and HESIOD occur to the mind since the Celtic history as well as the Grecian had its foundation in poetry  But to put it another way The Druids either travelled for knowledge or it was brought home to them from its parent countries and when so acquired it was incorporated among the pursuits and improvements of the hardy Britons They knew geography which not only comprehends a measurement of the globe itself but every one of its component parts which originated in CHALDEA passed into EGYPT improved in PHOENECIA and grew celebrated in GREECE  SOCRATES to humble ALCIBIADES asked him to trace his territories in ATHENS upon a map  They practised astrology an art characteristically Egyptian the pupils of which art have infested the world Had the Greeks or the Romans hardly a single camp where the astrologers and the soothsayers did not act their parts as naturally as the buffoons and the musicians Geometry which again took root in EGYPT and afterwards passed into GREECE was another of their studies and to these we are authorized to add theology  The theology of the Druids was that the soul does not die but passes from one to another To this and their natural philosophy LUCAN finely alludes and accounts for their contempt of death in their belief of immortality which by the way he calls an error  astronomy natural philosophy and politics  Are these the probable studies of an austere people shut up in an obscure nook at a part of the world far distant from that where these sciences originated What use was the doctrine of surveying coasts and harbours dividing and subdividing the world or the art of prophecying the fall and rise of empires or the principles and elements of extension to men who limited their pursuits to the little island of MONA No It will not bear any other construction than that the druids originally wanderers after combating schisms in their native countries set up their rest among other nations more likely to tolerate their opinions and venerate their doctrines  No part of their character however concerns the subject on which our attention is employed except as it relates to their having been denominated bards but in that capacity it is as fair to consider their hymns in their sacrifices to JUPITER and MERCURY as perfectly dramatic as the hymns of the ancient Greeks in praise of BACCHUS or the Egyptians in honour of ISIS and OSIRIS  If it be now allowed me that the Druids came  originally from EGYPT my remark is so came music so came all those arts which have enlighted the world Drawings gems coins monuments columns pyramids retain the forms of instruments invented by the Egyptians the properties and effects of which with very little variation are the same as many of those now in use among Europeans  Forgetting this I suppose an author full of ingenuity and intelligence asks what is become of the music of the ancients and why it is not as manifest to us as their pyramids their statues and their writings Unfortunately music is not a dead language letters are one thing notation is another Poems and chronicles relative to the actions of heroes and legislators are interesting and beget emulation sensations that relate to ideas may be faithfully transmitted from language to language by fixed rules and principles but which way are sensations to be transmitted to which no fixed rules can be annexed Delight undefined and rapture inexplicable It can never be forgotten that those great writers whose works are supposed to be authenticated to a letter are perpetually speaking of this very music and all its facination But the glory was to be reserved for a monk and that celestial art which was created with order and coeval with light instead of instantly diffusing universal pleasure and gladening the smiling world was doomed to remain a chaos an imperfect lump for so many thousands of years to be awakened into existence and shaped into symetry by a dronish priest in a solitary cloister Many obvious circumstances purely adventitious which have been instanced by a variety of authors will I am afraid stigmatize this friar this father GUIDO rather as a MARSYAS than crown him as an APOLLO Put melody out of the quest  on nature gives us harmony witness the bantum cock that in crowing tall a perfect fifth the hen that in  ckling rises a complete sixth the cuckoo that with the assistance of the bass which the ear is compelled to supposed makes an exact common chord But how this is extended when we consider the properties of foreign birds Did not the parrot the minor and the mocking bird whistle till father GUIDO like another ADAM gave them permission But after all what shall be said of the sloth that wonderful to relate to those who have not attended to nature begins at a key note repeats regularly every note afterwards in a major key till he includes the sixth and then sinks gradually to the key note again going over the very lesson of Sol fa in the wilds of AMERICA that musical friars and other modern harmonists teach to young ladies and other novices in the courts and cities of EUROPE Oh that Friar GUIDO should allow to the sloth that which he refuses to the ancients    History both sacred and profane is full of accounts in which musicians led on troops and animated them to victory and scarcely do we find any of these in which the ancient Gallic German and British Druids are not mentioned who are said to have been not only priests but musicians a part of whose profession it was to animate their countrymen to the fight How far back this obtained or to what degree of perfection it arrived it is not possible or if it were is it material to trace Certainly these customs existed before the Christian aera The Druids had schools where bodies of students assembled In these schools young men were brought up to learn arts and languages and particularly Greek and it is remarked that they learnt a great number of verses by heart By whom written Certainly by HOMER HESIOD AESCHYLUS  SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES What then did they learn Dramatic poems plays even from HOMER for I will not concede that the  Iliad  and the  Odyssey  are any other than dramatic poems in narrative  This whole fabric then must fall to the ground or it must be allowed that the Druids knew the dramatic art or at least were in possession of the productions of those who did know it in as high perfection as any thing it had attained before SHAKESPEAR How far they exercised it is certainly lest to conjecture Revolutions annihilate customs and obliterate their records Were it not for the Scriptures a knowledge of the early arts and improvements of the Hebrews would probably have been lost when they were led captives to BABYLON  What can give so complete an idea of an Oratorio certainly a dramatic entertainment as the Lamentations of the Children of ISRAEL upon the Banks of the EUPHRATES  and had not the Grecian arms carried the Grecian arts to the remotest corners of the earth the name of that great empire would have been extinguished with the empire itself SPAIN therefore when it was overrun with the Goths and Britons when it was invaded by the Romans having been merely imitators of other nations lost all the vestiges of those arts they had learnt in the sudden wreck of their general fortune  Having taken bold ground I shall I hope be pardoned if I go a little farther in searc  of probable argument to bear out not what I have advanced but what I have submitted BRITAIN before the invasion of JULIUS CESAR was divided into twentyseven sites or countries each governed by a king or a queen among whom were found at that time many famous for arts and arms Can it be credited that the quarrels the valour the gallantry the intercourse the intermarriages of this aristocracy could possibly have taken place without poetical celebration  It is infallible that they had the means of celebrating sacrifices  We are told that the BRITONS had more gods than the Egyptians therefore their superstition was greater They sacrificed beasts and sometimes men and are said to have augured from circumstances and symptoms so wonderfully that PLINY tells us the Britons were held in such estimation for astrology it seemed as if the Persians learnt magic from them not they from the Persians They determined all controversies and sung the deeds of heroes  victories and other ceremonies and festivals and therefore they did celebrate them probably in the manner of the provincial poets afterwards in FRANCE and it is feasible that their dramatic representations if there were any not being yet tainted with the licentiousness of the Romans were modelled by the purity of the Greeks since they knew Greek long before they  knew Latin  Many authors are of opinion that the Greeks landed often in BRITAIN and particularly in the North PLINY speaks of BRITAIN as an  freque  tly in the monuments and the records of both the Greeks and the Romans TH  LE certainly an island in SCOTLAND among the ORCADES the distance of which island from BRITAIN PYTHEAS describes as much mentioned and renowned among Greek writers and we are told by ATHENEUS that PHILEAS TAUROMINITES was  BRITAIN according to the date about one hundred and sixty year before the coming of JULIUS CAESAR and this account speaks of it as a recent thing for it was about a hundred and seventynine years before the Christian aera that ATHENEUS was a writer Many other proofs m  ght be adduced and in particular from SOLINUS w  o speaks of an altar in CALADONIA on which was to be seen an  ription to ULYSSES in Greek letters Vestiges of Drudical to  les having also been found in the Scotch islands the well k  own propensities of the Scotch to conform to their ancient rites manners and pastimes the productions of their early bards some  which that are truly epic and others that are written in dialogue  therefore actually dramatic leave very little doubt but that  epic and dramatic poetry of GREECE the Scotch bards de  much of their excellence  These are conjectures however not assertions▪ probabilities not certainties but since it is difficult to prevent the mind from leaning towards  belief of their spirit if not their letter they will not by the candid reader be considered here as an intrusion  CHAP III FROM THE INVASION OF THE ROMANS TO THE SAXON HEPTARCHY  AT the time of the Roman invasion we begin to be more decided CAESAR who was himself a playwright hardly invaded BRITAIN without his mimes His ambition was as much to be considered in quality of author as conqueror and we have seen him permit ACCIUS to treat him with indifference that he might the easier obtain a place in a literary assembly Nor was this derogatory even to CAESAR The world at this moment contemplate his writings with more pleasure than his conquests though his clemency was equal to his courage  From the instant the Britons had an intercourse with the Romans they imitated them in every thing The perpetual disputes concerning their tributes during the reigns of CAESAR and AUGUSTUS occasioned visits to ROME where the sons of the best families vied with each other in Roman accomplishments With these they returned and became objects  of imitation to their countrymen and though the Druids strenuously interfered the poison was imbibed and licentiousness soon took place of simplicity and hardihood  The very mention of the Augustan age suggests an idea of amusements and particularly of theatrical amusements which that emperor so largely encouraged Strangers flocked to ROME to see those stupendous theatres already described and to witness the exhibitions given in them Britons followed the examples of others and though in their continual struggles with the Romans they scarcely secured themselves a home and a residence yet they beguiled their misfortunes naturally enough with the sports and relaxations of their neighbours and for the performance of these they are actually said to have had a theatre  During the reign of TIBERIUS at which time they enjoyed more quiet civilization gained ground they permitted commercial intercourse to every part of the island and they imitated the manners of the Romans as faithfully and as servilely as we have seen the Romans imitate the manners of the Greeks  In these times reigned CARACTACUS the warlike  like king of the SILURES GALGACUS the worthy king of CALEDONIA and PRASUTAGUS king of ICENE over which province his wife the famous and unfortunate BOADICEA afterwards became queen These and their adherents were now among the few who resisted the licentiousness of the Romans and propped the declining reputation of the Druids  The reputation of the Druids began to decline from another circumstance Our SAVIOUR who was born in the reign of AUGUSTUS was crucified about four years before the death of TIBERIUS When the disciples dispersed at the time the Jews were banished from ROME we are told that both St PETER and St PAUL came and preached the Gospel in BRITAIN which as far as it relates to St PAUL is confirmed by so many authors that it can scarcely be doubted We have a very particular account of CLAUDIA RUFINA a British lady who was married to RUFUS a senator of ROME This lady was celebrated particularly by MARTIAL the poet for correctly understanding the Greek and Latin languages He says in one of his poems that she might have passed at ATHENS for a Greek and at ROME for a Roman But I particularly mention her here because she gave an asylum to St PETER and St PAUL at the time of their proscription and it is said that she was the special cause of St PAUL's mission to BRITAIN by whom as she knew the avidity of the Britons for Roman poetry she sent the verses of MARTIAL in consequence of which he says in another poem that  "the Britons begin to learn the verses of the Romans"  a strong corroboration of many things already here advanced  but the hardy and warlike spirit of the Britons was no more The struggle was in vain The rapacity the insolence and the corruption of the Romans had too much vitiated the manners of  the inexperienced Britons CARACTACUS betrayed by CARTISMANDUA the lustful wife of VINUTIUS king of the BRAGANTES was led a captive to ROME to grace the triumph of CLAUDIUS BOADICEA in the reign of NERO after sustaining with her daughters every possibly indignity and disgrace lost a battle in which fell eighty thousand of her adherents and afterwards poisoned herself  This very occasion affords abundant proof that the Britons not only knew the Roman refinements but practised them in the fullest extent After the injuries that the house and followers of PRASUTAGUS had sustained from the Romans they are said to have been inspired from Heaven with hope for that the image of Victory at CAMULODUNEM fell down reversed without any apparent cause That women ran distracted into the streets and prophecied destruction  "Strange noises were heard in the court"  says my author  "and howlings in the  theater  "  This is the English orthography the word spelled  theatre  being French but they both mean the same thing and all those figurative acceptations of the word such as theatre of the world theatre of war and others are nothing more than what time and usage have annexed to it for never among the Greeks the Romans or any other nation at least that I can trace was it used to express any thing but a place for the representation of dramatic entertainments SHAKESPEAR calls the world a wide and universal theatre but he who well knew a figure could not be perfect without all its limbs proves his position by adding that all the men and women are merely players But to corroborate this BOADICEA in her famous speech at the head of her troops calls NERO in derision a fidler and a stage player which we knew he was Nay she attributes the dissentions then in BRITAIN to their licentious imitation of the vices of the Romans disseminated by the jesters and buffoons whom she calls ROME's instruments and BRITAIN's vipers  But for these"  says she  "TIBERIUS though extremely coveteous would have foregone his tribute CLAUDIUS would been glad to have made peace and NERO would still have followed his fiddling trade at home had not the discords of BRITAIN been caused by his fiddlers here"  But indeed the whole of this speech is not only full of eloquence but erudition and plainly shews the knowledge and information of those Druids from whom she boasted her education Her noble yet how feminine in her quoting the examples of SYMIRAMIS of ASSYRIA NITOCRIS of BABYLON TOMYRIS of SCYTHIA and CLEOPATRA of EGYPT as proofs that it may be necessary for women to command armies but what does this prove in her That she Briton as she was at that early period had stored her mind with learning nay more that these matters were understood by those to whom she addressed them otherwise her eloquence would have been useless and her time thrown away But this is corroborated in an hundred instances one of which is the conduct of CARRACTACUS who though king of a remote people trained only to arms astonished the Romans when he was carried captive to ROME as much by his eloquence as by his fortitude  and the Druids who had wholly retired to their island of MONA were surrounded and exterminated  If the Britons had any amusements that bore a likeness to the drama before the Roman invasion that circumstance completely overturned them by adding amusements of a different complexion which again were prevented from gaining ground from the perpetual wars in which they first lost their dignity as a nation and afterwards degenerated into poverty and misfortune for the Romans having once made a complete conquest of the island  they so neglected the means of its internal defence that after the death of AGRICOLA it became an easy conquest to the Picts and Scots who were at length routed by VORTIGERN when he called in the assistance of the Saxons who conquered BRITAIN after it had been five hundred and twenty eight years governed by the Romans and twentyeight years after that in a state of complete anarchy  CHAP IV FROM THE SAXON HEPTARCHY TO THE NORMAN CONQUEST  AMIDST frequent gleams of certain light we must still wander in the gloom of conjecture yet if our enquiries are no more than ingenious they may entertain even though they should not convince and it may be worth while to cherish probability on a theme in which we interest ourselves rather than let the whole sink to oblivion and so withhold a clue from other enquirers who by being better in formed may be more successful  The question is whether or not it be of any moment to know if the dramatic art existed at all in this country prior to the sixteenth century before which time it certainly attained no considerable degree of celebrity but we are upon a subject in its nature calculated to excite curiosity and I fear if authors were precluded from exercising a little conjectural speculation ancient history of every sort would be involved in a very inconvenient predicament its  whole foundation sandy as it is being no more than tradition  From my own part I am willing to believe and I think this inclination rational enough that the only reason amusements and their nature have never been faithfully recorded in this country is because no actual government began to be settled here till ALFRED and that even his laws and regulations were not permanently carried into effect till king JOHN The history of this kingdom before the conquest consists of nothing more than a series of conflicting struggles for power and authority in the commemorating of which the historian naturally finds himself so involved and perplexed that had he the pen of HOMER he could not give it ingenuity enough to describe differently the various battles he has to deplore much less the different heroes who fell in those battles and admitting this what accurate account can we expect of the subjects of their relaxations whose occupations were restless ambition and destructive glory  Amusements nevertheless they must have had it would be childish to deny it and it is clearly within probability that previous to the Roman conquest these amusements consisted of such poetry and music as they imbibed from the Greeks as it  is evident that after the arrival of JULIUS CAESAR they partook of the dramatic and other sports and spectacles of the Romans  After these wanton plunderers had subdued this country despoiled it defaced it and left no vestiges of their insatiable lust of power but the miseries caused by its ravages they basely forsook its defenceless inhabitants now enervated by oppression as a prey to the first band of insurgents that might think proper to invade them The land became a scene of bloodshed and confusion till after a variety of sanguinary conflicts it began to lift up its head and flatter itself with protection under the Saxon heptarchy  During all this while however neither poetry nor its attendant music slept The only difference was that groves and recesses witnessed those numbers and those strains in terms and sounds of complaint and lamentation which before in sprightly and triumphant measure had delighted courts and animated armies Its fire was smouldering among the embers but not extinct A remnant of the luckless Druids still were scattered up and down particularly in CALEDONIA These required neither records for their poetry nor notation for their music Tradition supplied the matter and memory gave it utterance  These as the times became less furious gradually emancipated from their hiding places and as it had been long customary for every chief to have his bard for what would have been ACHILLES without HOMER the Saxon kings in the midst of their restless contentions by which they at length became united glad enough to lean to whatever might soften the horrors of war and introduce even in the rudest state something like civilization encouraged these bards to sing those exploits they had atchieved or to invent for them attributable atchievements to make them respected in the eyes of their dependants or else to stimulate them to great actions and their dependants to an admiration of them by the stories of kings and heroes which for ages had been handed down by tradition  Nor were VORTIGERN and those other Britons who after inviting the Saxons became their opponents more averse to listen to the poetry of the bard or the music of the harp The carousels and all the barbarous sports which made up the  cours plenieres  of the French immediately after the exstinction of the Roman empire no doubt pervaded BRITAIN and the Round Table and the Tournaments in the court of ARTHUR which were exactly the French entremets give incontestible proofs of this  The atcheivements of ARTHUR were sung by the bards of whom MERLIN is said to have been the chief  These songs were regularly handed down by the bards to one another It is not questionable with me whether in some of the old ballads in honour of the court of king ARTHUR we may not have the matter if not in some degree the very expressions that were uttered in the presence of that Prince All the authors who write moderately speaking of ARTHUR give fairly to his fame every traceable part of his prowess that can be reconciled to reason but believe not  "the scandalous fables poetical fictions and hyperbolical falsehoods"  attributed to him by fanciful writers In the same manner all reasonable men though they cannot consent to the fables of HOMER nor to the inventions of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES concerning the battle of TROY do not deny that there were battles at TROY and that there were many valiant atchievements performed there It has ever been the custom of bards to call in invention whenever the recital of a simple story was not sufficiently poetical and therefore though we cannot credit all that the Welch bards who were accustomed to sing to their harps at feasts the noble deeds of their ancestors have said of ARTHUR yet omitting all they have ascribed to his conduct attributable to supernatural agency we cannot deny the substance of their song in which they allow his existence and great prowess I shall relate a remarkable though a well known proof that all the songs of these bards were not merely legendary The burial place of ARTHUR had been for six hundred years unknown When HENRY the second and the first PLANTAGENET towards the end of his reign was at PEMBROKE he was entertained by some Welch bards who sung the deeds of ARTHUR In their songs were some obscure expressions that related to his burial which upon putting circumstances together convinced the king and his courtiers for it mentioned a churchyard in which two pyramids were standing that it must surely be at GLASTONBURY in SOMERSETSHIRE Here they resolved to search and having caused the ground to be dug up they sound at the depth of seven feet a stone with an inscription which convinced them their search would not be in vain They persevered and found ARTHUR and his queen both of whom were afterwards entombed in GLASTONBURY church and a cross of lead as it was taken off the stone with the inscription was to be seen in the Registry of that church till the suppression of that and many other religious places in the reign of HENRY the eighth  and if we go forward and come to  ALFRED we shall not only find him an excellent poet but an accomplished musician and what wonder in a prince of his rare talents who had been bred up at the court of ROME at a time when ITALY grew celebrated for poetry and music more than a hundred years after CHARLEMAGNE had gleaned in that country the materials to found an academy in his own and only a hundred and about fifteen years before that very GUIDO ARETINE who is falsely said to have invented music though it must be truly acknowledged that he was of very considerable advantage to it as far as relates to measure and regularity  But what need to go so forward as ALFRED or even ARTHUR to shew when poetry and music were known in BRITAIN Did not another Prince so early as the third century sing the wars of the Scotch and the Irish with all the beauty and majesty of HOMER Where can you find among the Greeks  more picture more dignity more pathos than in the writings of OSSIAN the son of FINGAL Are not those poems full of matter that relate to times long before they were written And are they not replete with that Grecian sweetness and sublimity so well known to the Druids and so well imparted in the education of their Princes Nay are they not full of those grecisms with which the Druids improved the Celtic tongue and finally are not many of them written in dialogue and therefore perfectly dramatic  As to ARTHUR the Knights Companions of the Round Table were warriors and poets so were those of RAIMOND BERENGER in PROVENCE to whom they have been often compared and so completely has it been settled that the amusements in BRITAIN and those in PROVENCE were exactly the same that the only dispute a matter of no moment to us has been which has boasted the preeminence in point of time certainly those in BRITAIN for ARTHUR lived seven hundred years before BERENGER I do not effect to deny that the accounts of the provincial poets are full of contradiction and liable to particular objection but this is rather an establishment of the general fact for as we know of the dramatic entertainments of GREECE and ROME and above all that ROME swarmed with  mimes and actors of most extraordinary merit at the time of the dissolution of the empire it is impossible but that they spread themselves wherever they could find an asylum and that having an immediate intercourse with ENGLAND they visited us as well as their neighbours  From ARTHUR to ALFRED by which time upwards of three hundred years had elapsed and the different kingdoms of the Saxon heptarchy were consolidated into one state amusements except such as stimulated heroes to great actions of course waited on occasion and could not be encouraged but during those intervals when peace gave pause to the tuba recta  It is curious enough to remark that the tuba recta a kind of double trumpet is without hesitation said to be the two trumpets of silver which MOSES was commanded to make in the Wilderness It was certainly very ancient and retained its original form in the sixteenth century In a picture at WINDSOR representing an interview between ARDRES and GUISNES are trumpets exactly like the tuba recta  and the tympanum and welcomed the harp and the ribible during these occasions we hear variously of the progress of music which was according to circumstances silenced for a time in different counties  St AUSTIN who it has been said brought choral  music into ENGLAND certainly to make his mission more welcome the purport of which was to convert the Saxons to Christianity brought with him forty Monks the greatest part of whom were fingers and so well did Pope GREGORY know that this was the best medium through which he could effect his purpose that a succession of fingers came over among whom was one of the most celebrated in ITALY  We find that the English ITALY in the seventh century was the county of KENT The clergy made music their study and disseminated the knowledge of it among the laity We have the authorities of HOLLINSHED and BEDE that they sung in the churches the Gregorian chant which we have been told by VOLTAIRE was not improved upon in FRANCE till LULLY The LULLY of KENT at that time was one PUTTA who was so little an OEPHIUS to ETHELRED king of the Mercians when he invaded KENT that he was obliged to obtain a privilege from the bishop of MERCIA to go about and teach music to such as would learn it and get companions to entertain the great for hire Here we have fairly the troubadours in ENGLAND and in the seventh century too    All this will abundantly prove for it is seriously wrong to instance too much extraneous matter that ALFRED opened his eyes in a country where music was well known and generally practised and with this pleasant circumstance he seems to have been particularly delighted for when he was sent very young to the court of ROME he omitted no opportunity  of improving himself in more arts than the art of reigning among which poetry and music seem to have been his favourites and though his literary productions consist of many volumes yet music was certainly his darling study BALE SPELMAN and others tell us that he most industriously encouraged music throughout the kingdom that he invited musicians into the country and particularly one GRIMBALD of whom the French writers have spoken very warmly This musician had been useful to ALFRED in his way to ROME and he was treated very honourably at the court of that monarch whose entertainments he regulated  It cannot now be denied that some of those amusements must have been dramatic at least as much as any of the masques and interludes which were written by BEN JONSON and performed in the court of queen ELIZABETH for if they were merely choral what had the harp to do with them And how could they be any other than works of fancy and variety when the king himself was the best harper in the band as it evidently turned out afterwards when he assumed the form of a common minstrel in the Danish camp where he must have conformed himself to the personating every kind of character to avoid detection since he remained many days and was obliged to conciliate favour from  the lowest to the highest in the character of a vagabond and a hireling  From the moment ALFRED sat down in profound peace and perfect security he with the most indefatigable industry began to extend civizilation and to make his name as famous for arts as it had been for arms He found his subjects in consequence of such a succession of struggles sunk into the grossest ignorance and barbarism He therefore as we have seen invited celebrated scholars from all parts of EUROPE and became himself the stimulus for their education He was a very voluminous author and he founded the University of OXFORD or at least restored it where every literary and musical study were encouraged The arts flourished under him He became their natural and acknowledged patron The trees and stones followed him like another ORPHEUS and as AUGUSTUS said he found ROME brick and left it marble so ALFRED might have said he found ENGLAND timber and left it brick and stone which for the country and the time was a proportionable improvement Not only the necessaries but the luxuries of life were now enjoyed by the Britons for which voyages were made even to the MEDITERANIAN and other ports but nothing satisfied him so much as the cultivation of the politer arts A writer says  whom ALFRED well knew and encouraged that  "a great city should not only be commodious and serious but also merry and sportful  In one of his acts there are these words  "We will and command that all freemen of our kingdom possessing two hides of land shall bring up their sons in learning till they be fifteen years of age at least so that they may be trained to know GOD to be men of understanding and to live happily for of a man that is born free and yet illiterate we repute no otherwise than of a beast a brainless body and a very sot"  "  and this is afterwards quoted by FITZSTEPHEN after the Roman conquest when he speaks of the drama at that time  ALFRED translated from the Greek and thus knew SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES ARISTOPHANES and MENANDER  ALFRED delighted in translating fables particularly those of AESOP that instruction might be conveyed through the medium of allegory Is it possible the drama could escape this great judge of the human mind as a vehicle for teaching social duty  and therefore with his accomplished knowledge must have been a correct dramatic critic As this is true and as all authors have been lavish in the praise of his own poetry and music and indeed whenever a prince has been held up as an example for the world's imitation ALFRED has been the darling theme it cannot be questioned that he made it his study to procure inoffensive  amusements for the leisure hours of his people that so their minds might more willingly embrace such useful pursuits as in following the example of their king might worthily secure that peace and happiness which not more the greatness than the cultivation of his mind had after so many severe conflicts and fluctuating vicissitudes so nobly established  I cannot here resist my inclination to offer an obvious remark which by the writers of all countries has been overlooked whenever they have supported the cause of the drama In ENGLAND it may have proceeded from indifference which however I shall not caval at for it is at last for the public to judge how far the antiquity of the theatre is an object worthy of consideration My remarks may be thought futile and those researches which I may fancy meritorious may be considered as impertinent and irrelevant I am in for it however and hope to be pardoned if I endeavour to clinch every nail I can The observation I allude to is that nobody since HESTOD has refused unequivocally to accord the province of tragedy to MELPOMENE and of comedy to THALIA The Muses were fabulous divinities of the heathens who certainly knew nothing more of them than their statues created by fancy Of these originally there were but three These presided over meditation memory and singing which last taken in its extended sense means recording At length a sculptor pleased like PROMETHEUS with his employment made nine statues instead of three and they were all placed in the Temple of APOLLO HESIOD gave to them their names and their attributes on which account probably it is said be was personally acquainted with the Muses This was about three thousand years ago the fact has never been disputed and however there may have been trifling variations from it however the provinces of CALLIOPI CLIO and URANIA may have been exchanged or blended together by literary cavil however POLYHYMNIA may have been sometimes the muse of music sometimes of dance and sometimes of rhetoric however TERPSICHORE may according to some have presided over the harp and to others over dancing or in short however different authors may have wrested authorities to their own purposes by changing the attributes of those muses it was their ambition to invoke no one attempt has been made to deprive MELPOMENE and THALIA of the sole and exclusive possession respectively of tragedy and comedy This admitted must it not have been familiar to every writer since HESIOD what the dramatic art actually is and was Nay before HESIOD for how could he have given them supremacy over an art that was not in existence We cannot reject this unless we reject the ancients altogether and if we permit their heroes to have invoked MARS and BELLONA that great actions might be atchieved we must permit their poets to have invoked the muses that great actions might be recorded and as this has never been so effectually done as through the medium of the theatre can any writer ancient or modern have been ignorant of all the requisites of an art so known so acknowledged and so defined ALFRED knew this art He knew the truth of every word here written Will it then be easily credited that he did not encourage that remembrancer of same to which so many heroes had been indebted for the perpetuation of their glory It cannot be believed and the only reason why we are ignorant at this minute of the nature of what the dramatic amusements then were is the indifference with which all the English chroniclers as well as those whose works have been their source of intelligence have  ed a subject on which they have seldom touched unless when it has involved some more important object and then they have scarcely d  igned to afford it particular notice    After the death of ALFRED the liberal arts and of course the stage very soon received a violent check and those improvements which had been made in every branch of study during the last three years the only period in the reign of ALFRED that  the kingdom enjoyed profound peace for want of such a patron were neglected EDWARD's quarrels with ETHELWALD engrossed his attention too much to give any object place in his mind but arms Had ALFRED's second son ETHELWARD who inherited his father's genius for letters succeeded him 'tis very probable the dramatic art might then have been ascertained He however whatever his inclination might be found it probably very difficult to establish the arts in so turbulent a reign under so turbulent a king he therefore retired and spent a short life in various studies and in particular philosophy and theology  ATHELSTAN was a king as little likely to promote the arts as EDWARD He had foreign and domestic enemies and in spight of all his efforts licentiousness grew to such an intolerable height that EDMUND his successor who thought he should put a stop to it by extending the rigour of the penal laws was massacred for his pains by a thief EDRED who was little more than a Regent and who suffered himself in the most turbulent times to be blindly led by DUNSTAN by which means the monks ruled the kingdom and would have turned it into a papal province had he not died gave also poor encouragement to the arts There are nevertheless many reasons to suspect that during this and  the preceding reign the mysteries or perhaps miracleplays which will be fully described hereafter originated or rather were revived for it is extremely difficult to say when they originated  Before DUNSTAN the monks were secular priests They had the education of youth and taught in families as well as in schools and we have always found that in order to enforce education something in the nature of these miracle plays was performed in which there had been perpetually a contention between the priests and the lay brothers It is therefore very probable that when DUNSTAN in the plenitude of his power established the benedictine order and endeavoured to render every thing completely ecclesiastical these plays performed by the secular monks were put down or rather suspended in one form or another for as many of these lay brothers did nothing more than become monks under monastic restriction it is very unlikely though the place of action might be altered that the farce itself did not go on especially as St DUNSTAN himself was a very good actor particularly in pantomime witness the unmerciful manner in which he took the devil by the nose  It is also difficult to disbelieve that the pranks  DUNSTAN played poor EDWY and the wanton and unmanly indignities which through him were offered to his innocent and lovely queen could have passed without comment especially as in spight of his power he had not yet extirpated the secular clergy who were both able and willing for the sake of decency and in justice to their injured king to expose such insolence and rapacity and that they did expose it by some means of this kind is not at all improbable when we know that not more than eighty years afterwards as we shall see in its place a play was introduced in the common sports of the people in derision of HARDICANUTE's coronation  Various other curious tricks are related of this holy hypocrite among these his miracle by which he wholly got rid of the secular priests is not amiss After a variety of warm disputes in which the laiety were sometimes victorious and sometimes the clergy it was agreed to refer every thing to a solemn investigation in a Synod to be held in WILTSHIRE This Synod being met and the controversy propounded the parties addressed each other in a strain of the bitterest invective till as they were on the point of proceeding from words to blows the floor of the room which was an upper apartment gave way and came to the ground with the greatest violence in consequence of which many limbs were broken and some lives lost The post however on which DUNSTAN's chair was placed stood firm by which means he escaped the fate of the rest This was considered as a miracle in favour of the monks and the secular clergy of course lost their cause He also played another prank with a post which starting from its situation had very nearly destroyed a whole building By only however making the sign of a cross upon it with his finger it returned very quietly to its place and the building became again secure But why should we wonder that he was so expert at those wooden miracles when has very harp would work miracles of itself for while it played at his command several hymns untouched by any human hand the Virgin MARY condescendingly came and sung to it Then for angels he had them of all descriptions for his familiar acquaintance and thus by their assistance he had it so completely in his power to resist the devil that in all manner of shapes he whipt him away with thongs and cords nay when he came to him in the form of a woman he pinched him by the nose with a pair of red hot tongs that by destroying his beauty there might be no motive left for temptation    EDGAR whose own story including his marriage with ELFRIDA after the murder of her husband has been more than once made the subject of a play is known to have countenanced magnificient entertainments and therefore he no doubt encouraged plays 'Tis hardly to be supposed that he whom the monks permitted to practice every scandalous and treacherous art while they called him the most perfect of mankind had not his minstrels to feed his vanity His carrying off the nun which the priests piously permitted and his breach of hospitality by means of which his mistress ELFLEDA was palmed upon him are of too romantic a cast not to have called for celebration besides he notoriously suffered his people to take in every thing their own course by which means though his own reign was undisturbed the consequences fell heavy on his  successor the unfortunate EDWARD whose unquiet reign was terminated by his stepmother ELERIDA who caused him to be assassinated that she might place her own son ETHELRED upon the throne  ETHELRED the offspring of ingratitude profligacy and murder spoke his origin in all his actions in consequence of which dissention folly and vice stalked through the kingdom and were no doubt reflected by satire's mirror Owing to this the Danes grew so powerful that when EDMUND IRONSIDE succeeded to the defence of the kingdom he had scarcely a kingdom to defend  ETHELRED was another NERO to BRITAIN He bribed the Danes many times to retire who always returned in exultation He permitted continually a Danish army in the kingdom and thereby subjected it to a thraldom such as it had experienced in the hands of the Romans at the time of BOADICEA The same rapacity the same prosligacy the same infamy prevailed Alarmed therefore for the consequence and advised by EDRICK with whom he is said to have shared some of the money the people gave to bribe the Danes he caused a general massacre of them throughout the kingdom  This of course roused the Danes who breaking  through all treaties came so powerfully upon him that he first retired to NORMANDY but returned upon the death of SWEYN who had occupied the English crown six weeks  ETHELRED's imbecility cowardice and folly however had by this time made him an object of detestation to his subjects and he finished an inglorious reign in the midst of difficulties which his son EDMUND vainly struggled with great courage and perseverance to dissipate till after a single combat between EDMUND and CANUTE which was advised by the very EDRICK who had been the parasite of ETHELRED and who afterwards murdered EDMUND to present CANUTE with his head the kingdom was by agreement divided in two  During all these contentions we hear of sports but nothing more The priests seem to have been silent I shall therefore urge no further probabilities of the existence of interludes or other dramatic amusements at that time than the proofs which will be presently advanced that they were well known at the death of HARDICANUTE  The reign of CANUTE which passed entirely in reconciling jarring opinions he at all times embracing  that conduct most likely to conciliate the affection of the people was certainly favourable to amusements He built churches endowed monastries and appointed revenues for the celebration of mass Nay he made a pilgrimage to ROME from whence it would have been useless to return without something to instruct and amuse These arts which he used to flatter his subjects were returned with the grossest adulation this gave rise to the well known story of his reproving the tide in the presence of his courtiers The nation however was immersed in barbarism and though he was greatly esteemed for his power and his virtues he succeeded but little in polishing the manners of his people  HAROLD whatever improvements CANUTE had been able to make soon overturned them As if conscious of a very short reign he introduced dissipation more than enough into it for a long one It is not easy to say whether he or his brute of a brother was the most dissolute and contemptible One lived hated and dispised three years and the other but two The first died a prey to remorse for treachery towards ALFRED a descendant of the Saxon kings and the murder of him and his followers and the other expired amidst his beastly revels through plenitude and drunkenness  We have upon this occasion clearly a proof of the existence of plays and interludes for HARDICANUTE was held in such contempt by his subjects that a play was written after his death in derision and it for a long time was annually performed by the title of  Hock Holiday  These annual sports of which this play made a part and which were continued by the English so long that they are not wholly unknown even at this day have a very early origin If we trace bullbateing to its source throwing at cocks on Shrove Tuesday or any other of those diversions which have been long sanctioned by time we shall find they all originated from commemorating some national event This we are at present speaking of was imitated from the Fugalia a feast celebrated among the Romans in memory of the expulsion of the kings and the abolishing the monarchical government originally instituted under the title of the Regifugium and held on the twentyfourth of February on account of the Tarquins flying from ROME on that day There have been many disputes as to whether these two words mean the same thing the meaning of one of them is pretty obvious but St AUGUSTINE says that in a true fugalia all decency and modesty were banished which clearly shews the two feasts to be similar Certainly the Romans had not more reason to rejoice at the expulsion of the Tarquins than the English had at the expulsion of the Danes and the sports on Hock Holiday or Hokeday which certainly was a solemn festival instituted at the death of HARDICANUTE when the English were for ever released from the wanton insults and boundless exactions of him and his countrymen are a positive proof that the inhabitants of this country were not ignorant of those amusements which made up upon public occasions the pleasure of the Romans among which something theatrical was always introduced Hokeday is known as a law term and signifies a certain period which indeed was the second Tuesday after Easter week when rent became due There is some tenure of this kind by which Magdalan College at OXFORD hold lands in HAMPSHIRE As to the term hocking it was no more than this Before the spectators arrived at the place where this play and these sports were to be performed they were obliged to pass a rope extended across the road which upon their paying money was let down to give them a safe and an easy passage If they refused to pay it was kept up to hurt their skins and resist their coming forward Hokeday money or Hoketuesday money all authors agree was a tribute anciently paid the landlord for giving his tenants and his bondmen leave to celebrate Hockday or Hokeday in memory of the expulsion of the Danes    From this time forward we see by every symptom that the English encouraged interludes of various kinds EDWARD the Confessor who restored the Saxon line having but slender and distant pretensions to the crown and having been bred up in the court of NORMANDY introduced French manners and therefore facilitated the conquest At no period of the world were there stronger contentions for preeminence in music than at this BERNO Abbot of RICHENOU ODO of CLUNI GAFFURIUS GLAREANUS and ten or twelve other writers whose names are now before me give us long accounts of this emulation which prevailed both in ITALY and in FRANCE The Abbays of CORBIE of RHEIMS and of CLUNI were the great seminaries for musical instruction in FRANCE To these young monks were sent from ENGLAND to be taught by REMI D'AUXERRE WIGERIC  bishop of METZ NOTKER LE BEGUE and others who were not only famous musicians but celebrated writers till at length about the time of the conquest of ENGLAND appeared GUIDO ARETINE who though he invented nothing of music itself so regulated it and reduced it to practise that the art certainly benefited greatly by his improvement  We shall hereafter have good opportunity to shew that EDWARD the Confessor tolerated dramatic entertainments and particularly at CHESTER and at COVENTRY where mysteries as well as interludes were certainly performed    This being the case and French manners being every day introduced into ENGLAND at the very moment too when the troubadours with their sirventes and tensons were overrunning NORMANDY is it possible to deny that interludes satires and farces of some description were known at that time in ENGLAND Here then we will halt for as HAROLD who if he could be said to have reigned was merely an usurper nothing more can be traced of a new complexion to prove the fact which I am striving to establish and which I have no doubt by the corroboration of future circumstances will be made perfectly clear  CHAP V FROM THE NORMAN CONQUEST TO EDWARD THE THIRD  WE are now come to a period when it will be less difficult to ascertain the true nature of those dramatic entertainments which were performed early in ENGLAND The turbulent disorders that had so long convulsed the kingdom having been in great measure shook off at the conquest amusements which no doubt had been at different intervals alternately discontinued and renewed began to be established upon a more permanent footing It also became more an object to authors to notice them and owing to this we thereabout begin to get certain intelligence that various dramatic pieces were exhibited and in particular mysteries such as we have seen though at a much later date so anxiously followed in FRANCE  The NORMAN conquest was effected in and not more than thirtyseven years afterwards the priory of St BARTHOLOMEW in Smithfield  was erected by a man of the name of RAHERE who was called the King's Minstrel and whose monument is now to be seen in that church in the north side of the chancel This man kept a company of fidlers and he so insinuated himself into the good graces of HENRY the first early in that reign that he gained from the king the manor of AIOT in HERTFORDSHIRE where going from one extreme to another he became religious and was the first prior in his own priory  It is not wonderful that RAHERE should be a favourite in the court of HENRY who loved the arts and who from his genius and literary merit obtained the title of Beauclere or the Scholar Galantry was the characteristic of his court and so greatly did he befriend toleration that he was the first king who granted the city of LONDON a charter which laid the foundation of their privileges and may be considered as the origin of English freedom  As this priory which was destroyed by HENRY the eighth was erected in and after RAHERE had run his career as a minstrel it cannot be denied that minstresly had been long well known and in great repute  Lest the employment of minstrel should be considered as merely that of a fidler let it be once for all recollected that we have both French and Latin authorities to the contrary It is derived in the French from  Menestrier  which title distinguished all the provincial poets whom as we have seen were actors and the monkish historians themselves never designate them but by the word  Mimus  or  Histrio  or  Joculator  or some other expression which signifies gesture It was in this capacity they were received into the presence of the great and it is very striking that they certainly were with both friends and enemies a priviledged people for when ALFRED assumed this character in the camp of the Danes they must have known him to be a Saxon but being a minstrel they gave him an honourable reception and this fact cannot be got over for it is not enough to say that ALFRED being a highly accomplished character might perhaps have passed for a Danc because a Danish chief about sixty years afterwards in the face of this fact of ALFRED's having betrayed the Danish camp made use of the same stratagem to surprize the camp of the Saxons in the reign of ATHELSTAN Minstress therefore were certainly an improvement of the mimes and histrions of the Romans and their entertainments were the farces that were performed in all countries and as perfectly dramatic as any of the masques in the reign of ELIZABETH or the drolls at BARTHOLOMEW Fair which place after all might have been RAHERE's scene of action especially as he chose Smithfield to finish his career where that he might not deviate he still continued in the character of an actor  It must have taken him some years  to have made his fortune and then that profession must have been pretty well respected by which a man could honestly make a fortune at all But comments will become every moment more unnecessary for we shall soon have facts to bear out our argument  While RAHERE at the head of his company was making his fortune by the interludes which his entertainments certainly were the priests who also perhaps wished to make fortunes were very busy in their attempts to establish the mysteries In the  eleventh century and if early in the eleventh century before the conquest GEFFROI a French monk came over here and was made Abbot of St ALBANS This monk being intrusted with the education of youth made his scholars act this kind of tragedies one of which was called  The Miracles of St Catherine    The different accounts of this man and this fact agree so perfectly that it will be worth while to dwell on the subject a little longer GEFFROI a Norman by birth as we are told by French and English authors was sent over by Abbot RICHARD to undertake the direction of the school at St ALBANS He arrived too late and went to DUNSTABLE where he taught in the Abbey and set about performing this miracle play there He afterwards got into the situation originally intended for him and his scholars at St ALBANS acted this and doubtless other entertainments of the same nature for which purpose the sacristan lent them copes from the neighbouring Abbey at St ALBANS to dress their characters  Monsieur L'EXTANT thinks that this was an attempt towards the revival of dramatic entertainments all over EUROPE Nothing can be stronger  than this We have seen that the priests in FRANCE performed sacrilgeous farces full of the grossest indelicacy and so offensive against religion and all decency that CHARLEMAGNE was obliged to suppress them in the eighth century A period more than a hundred years before ALFRED Does it not appear very feasible then that they had been known here Might not ETHELRED an honest heathen have been shocked at the shameful mummery of the christian priests and therefore have put down PUTTA and his followers Who certainly understood the trade of acting otherwise they would not have strolled about afterwards as troubadours  St AUSTIN by the same token might have introduced some irregularities into this kingdom especially as many of his monks were Italian singers a description of characters which even to this moment have never been remarkably celebrated for having imported much virtue among us It must be recollected that he came here with extreme reluctance the feelings of the Saxon heathens having rather revolted at the Devil's dances performed in the churches which St AUSTIN with all his sanctity perhaps was not able wholly to suppress to which supposition his having previously determined to gain their hearts by tickling their ears rather than appealing  to their understandings lends great probability  The idea of L'EXTANT therefore that GEFFROI's miracle play or plays for it is very unlikely that he performed but one was a revival of those entertainments is very fair They had been not only in ENGLAND and in FRANCE but all over EUROPE at different times according as they conformed to decency and morality or grew into licentiousness permitted and suppressed Nothing therefore can be more probable than that they had undergone an interdiction about the time of the conquest either for improper conduct or owing to the troubles of the times and that GEFFROI a Norman came over with the Normans and revived an amusement which he thought would be welcome to a people who wished for a little relaxation after the convulsions the kingdom had sustained  STEPHEN who seems never to have had that truncheon out of his hand which was his only weapon of defence when he was dethroned had virtue enough to have promoted the arts but owing to the turbulence of the nobles who looked with a jealous eye on that freedom which HENRY had granted the people his efforts at civilization were like a whisper in a tempest  But this was not the case with HENRY the second his successor who being sole monarch of ENGLAND and possessor of more than a third of FRANCE did not fail to transplant here those amusements which were then the delight of the Continent Nor was BECKET any more behind hand with him than WOLSEY with HENRY the eighth for he passed through a variety of profligate pleasures before he wore sackcloth next his skin and daily washed the feet of thirteen beggars  The unbridled gallantry of HENRY of which we have many more proofs than that of ROSAMOND put to death by ELEONOR who was herself repudiated by her first husband LOUIS the seventh for incontinency and who was daughter of Count VENTADOUR a provincial poet was good food for poetry which he certainly encouraged Nay his two sons RICHARD and GEOFFRY whose undutiful conduct broke his heart were both as we shall presently see troubadours  But to prove that the drama was now not only well known but that it was considered a subject of sufficient consequence for celebration an elaborate work was written early in the reign of HENRY which speaks not only of interludes performed at the theatre but of plays upon more holy subjects  in which were represented the miracles wrought by Our SAVIOUR's disciples and the fortitude and constancy of those blessed martyrs Now had this author noticed these matters as a discovery a thing that was invented or brought into ENGLAND by the Normans we might have ground to believe that nothing dramatic at least nothing worth notice had been known in ENGLAND before But this is not the case He does not speak of these matters as novelties but only as a part of those amusements which had been long known and followed  To say that this book was published to tell the inhabitants of LONDON or indeed any part of the kingdom that miracles were then performing and that they then supplanted interludes would be nonsense No man needed any such information He might mean that these mysteries which at that time continued to be performed had when they were revived put by the interludes which was no more than the old quarrel between the priests and the laity but nothing can be more clear than that this work alludes to the interludes of RAHERE certainly performed during the reign of WILLIAM RUFUS rigid as his character was which when RAHERE retired were suspended for the miracle plays of GEFFROI  His words are  "instead of interludes performed at the the theatre"  from which we are obliged to infer that it had been customary to perform interludes and at a theatre for probably a long time before the conquest but that at the time he speaks of those interludes gave way to more holy representations clearly alluding to RAHERE and GEFFROI  Of what materials those interludes were composed or on what sort of theatre they were represented it is not very easy to determine nor indeed is it very essential The theatre however implies some regular place some well known situation frequented and tolerated and the amusements were probably a mixture of those performed by the the trouveres and the troubadours in PROVENCE adopted according to circumstances to the English taste by those minstrels who ever since ALFRED had been encouraged to visit ENGLAND from ITALY  At any rate 'tis plain to be seen that religion did for ENGLAND what it had done for FRANCE and in proportion as WILLIAM abolished the trials by ordeal the camp sights and all those savage practices which had been held in such veneration by the Saxons the priests took the opportunity of inculcating  morality by dramatic representations of those holy facts the parade of which has oftener made proselytes than the doctrine  This will shew in almost an indubitable light that those arts which ALFRED protected and to promulgate which he like other princes of all times became a writer and a performer and which we have traced through almost the whole of the Saxon heptarchy obtained here as well as in ITATY and as in FRANCE and that fluctuating according to circumstances they were sometimes sacred and sometimes profane  RICHARD COEUR DE LION succeeded to HENRY the second who not more than a hundred and twenty years after the conquest was as we have seen celebrated in PROVENCE as a poet and a performer and so was his brother GEOFFRY We have a great variety of authorities for this corroborated by circumstances which we cannot easily doubt and which after all was not wonderful in RICHARD for it was only taking after his mother's family  The whole intelligence concerning this business is clogged with contradiction and absurdity but it is however universally allowed that he resided in  PROVENCE probably in the court of GISBERT the second Count  It has been asserted that RICHARD lived in the court of RAIMOND BERENGER and that he married one of his daughters Both these assertions are false RICHARD died in at which time BERENGER was but a year old for BERENGER died in at the age of forty seven  and that he wrote sonnets and other poetry Some of which are complaints against his barons for suffering him to remain in captivity These were addressed to the princesses of the court and some of them are now to be found in ancient authors The authorities for all this rest upon CRESCEMBINI MATHEW PARIS RYMER FAVINE BEAUCHAMP and many others who however they may vary in immaterial particulars all agree upon the general fact  An ancient bard called GUILHEM BRITON has the following distich speaking of RICHARD  Coblas a tiera faire adroitement  Pon vos oillez enten dompna gentilz  which may be thus translated  Stanzas he invented neat  Upon the eyes of ladies sweet  But RYMER gives us the following extract and its translation from a song RICHARD wrote when he was prisoner in AUSTRIA  Or sachan ben mos homs mos barons  Anglez Normans Peytavins Gascons  Qu' yeu non ay ja si paure compagnon  Que per aver lou laissess en preson  Know ye my men my barons all  In England and in Normandy  In Poictiers and in Gascony  I no compan on held so small  To let him thus in distance lie  This translation is bad enough certainly but it helps strongly to corroborate that RICHARD was one of the Provincial poets    From FAVINE we have the interesting intelligence  of his being released from captivity through the assistance of BLONDEL who was bred up in his court and with whom he had been accustomed to sing songs in dialogue This BLONDEL who was a native of NESLE and had been from his infancy a trouverre followed the fortunes of RICHARD and when by the treachery of the duke of AUSTRIA he was confined he sought with every possible diligence for his master pursuing still his occupation of minstrel in hopes that some intelligence by good fortune might reach the king through which he might work out his release By an unexpected chance he happened to come near the castle where his master was confined who upon hearing without the wall one half of a well known song and recollecting perfectly the voice of BLONDEL sung the other  half himself that their intelligence might be mutual This hint was enough for BLONDEL He returning privately to ENGLAND informed the barons where their king was imprisoned who immediately set about and at length accomplished his release  In addition to these and other proofs that RICHARD was actually and to the fullest extent one of the provincial poets I have a variety of authorities that cannot be questioned Nevertheless to shew the fact as strong as possible and also that his poetical propensity greatly forwarded the dramatic art in ENGLAND besides BLONDEL FOUQUET and others that FAIDIT of whom we have seen BEAUCHAMP the panegyrist and whose works contain the rudiments of regular tragedy which PARASOLS afterwaids is said to have perfected came to ENGLAND with RICHARD and it was immediately upon this that not only at the English court but in all families of distinction interludes and other performances in the style of sirventes and tensons were performed both by performers hired for the purpose and by the great themselves which was so customary say BEDE and others that such as were not capable of joining were necessitated to retire  FAIDIT was certainly a dramatic writer of considerable eminence BEAUCHAMP who by the way has in many instances refuted the errors of other authors speaks positively of the tragedies and comedies of FAIDIT and does not hesitate to say that he got prodigious sums by them in quality of manager which wealth being a great voluptuary he dissipated as fast as it came All this must have been when he was very young for it was in consequence of the difficulties into which he was driven by these excesses that he entered into the service of RICHARD and it is very probable though all authors do not agree in this that it was before he came to ENGLAND he stole a nun whom he made his wife and afterwards exhibited her as a singer and an actress in which capacities she is said to have been excellent She served him however a great many slippery tricks and at the death of his patron he returned to PROVENCE having first written a funeral poem in honour of RICHARD There it is probable the friends he acquired being very powerful he obtained his pardon for we find him again very celebrated and greatly protected His comedy called  L'Heregia dels Preyers  procured him the patronage of BONIFACE Count of MONTFERRAT He must have died about at between fifty and sixty for it must always be remarked that the dates placed against the names of the provincial poets are not those of their births but either of their deaths or the times they were in the highest reputation    From this time these amusements were not only tolerated in the capital but they were encouraged throughout the kingdom for though these minstrels were considered as vagabonds in common with fencers bearwards c yet many instances of favour were shewn to them all and well it might be so for the gentry constantly mixed in their sports It is on this account probably that they have been on so many occasions entitled to the protection  of the law Ever since the time of king JOHN to this hour in all the laws for the regulation of amusements there is an exemption in favour of the minstrels of CHESTER  The occasion of this exemption is curious enough but perhaps I should pass it by did it not tend to corroborate what I am labouring to prove In the reign of king JOHN RANDLF earl of CHESTER being shut up by the Welch in the castle of Rothelent in FLINTSHIRE sent to ROGER DE LACEY or as others say ROBERT constable of CHESTER to come instantly to his assistance with any and every kind of force he could muster It being then the Fairtime when of course all kinds of sports were going forward LACEY gathered together a large multitude of fidlers stageplayers shoemakers and other debauched persons who assailed the Welch and rescued the earl from prison RANDLE out of gratitude gave LACEY authority over the fidlers stageplayers and shoemakers of CHESTER He however availed himself only of his power and donation to him and his heirs over the shoemakers but consigned the remainder of his privileges to his steward JOHN DUTTON whose heirs have ever since enjoyed it as may be seen by the Vagabond Act in the seven teenth year of GEORGE the second which contains a proviso in favour of that family giving licence to them and their heirs to tolerate minstrels and players of interludes at CHESTER in exclusion of all other authority  and ever since JOHN of GAUNT in favour of those of TUTBURY in STAFFORDSHIRE  When the ancient earls and dukes of LANCASTER who were always of the blood royal kept their abode at TUTBURY musicians and performers of masques interludes and other entertainments came to amuse the great concourse of people that flocked thither from all parts The performers being very numerous many quarrels happened among them in consequence of which many laws were made for regulating their conduct and a governor was appointed over them by the title of their King The first of these charters granted to a king of the minstrels was by JOHN of GAUNT in the fourth year of RICHARD the second's reign    Though we have plainly seen that JOHN whose reign was equally remarkable for wickedness and weakness countenanced dramatic amusements yet the arts certainly materially declined during that period HENRY the third however must have inevitably restored them for he married ELEONOR daughter of BERENGER that provincial nobleman and troubadour who has been already noticed He invited her relations and friends to reside in ENGLAND lavished on them costly and extravagant presents manifested the greatest fondness and affection for them gave them places of trust and emolument and married them to sons and daughters of the English nobility  There is a circumstance relative to the fortune of that extraordinary man RAYMOND BERENGER which may not be unentertaining His court was frequented by literary characters of all descriptions Among the rest came a pilgrim named ROMEO At this time owing to his imprudent liberality and profusion the affairs of BERENGER were so deranged that he had been under the necessity of mortgaging his possessions Struck with the extraordinary wit and good sense of ROMEO who had returned from a visit to the church of St JAMES at COMPOSTELLA he singled him out as his adviser and confidential friend upon this occasion ROMEO undertook by reducing his expences and getting him out of the hands of usurers to restore to his patron his estates and revenues and being trusted with unlimitted power and controul be even effected more than he had promised for he not only redeemed but improved his friend's affairs His next project was to marry BERENGER's four daughters his only issue to four kings which he also as we have seen effected This has particular relation to the subject we are now upon for ROMEO was indefatigable through these various and splended connections to extend not only the influence of BERENGER but the cause of poetry of which he was a professor and an admirer and thus we account for the prodigious number of provincials invited over to ENGLAND by HENRY the third who married ELEONOR the second daughter The Count however as much a bard as he was did not seem in this instance to understand poetical justice the great persons with whom he now became connected jealous that he should shew such extraordinary attention to an utter stranger raised so violent a clamour against him that they induced BERENGER to call his administration to account assuring him that such transactions would transpire as would induce his dismission ROMEO submitted to a strict enquiry which triumphantly redounded to his honour BERENGER ashamed of his conduct entreated that what had passed might be forgotten  "Count"  said the pilgrim  "I have long had your confidence and I have raised your very moderate fortune to a prodigious one You have ungratefully listened to my enemies who are confounded at my integrity I came into your court poor you relieved me and my fidelity requited you I have nothing I can call my own but my mule my staff and my ponch Return me these and farewell for ever"  In this resolution he persuted He departed and left BERENGER in dispair and sorrow for having abused the truest and most disinterested friend he had ever known In vain did he attempt to recal him every perquisition proved fruitless The honest injured creature was never after heard of This fact is incontestible Many authors have given it without any  alteration and FONTENELLE was so affected with it that he intended to have made it a work of itself if his avo  ations had permitted him Nay DANTE in a poem places ROMEO for his virtues in Heaven    He made a Poictevin bishop of WINCHESTER  sent over his mother for other provincial strangers and at last was so fond of acting these kind of farces that he severely exasperated his people against him and had not his gallant son EDWARD towards the end of his long and turbulent reign checked the unbounded and proffigate licentiousness of his internal enemies it would have been impossible for him to have sat quietly on the throne  EDWARD the first who conquered the Welch and afterwards rendered himself celebrated by completely subduing the Scotch though he had a great and noble soul was but little at leisure to cultivate the arts The great hinge on which history turns is war and thus especially if they should be harrassed by internal war we find the histories of all nations involved in a series of sanguinary disputes while the milder and more beneficent attractions which ought to characterize human nature become subordinate considerations and it is on this account that the relaxations which nature and reason permit are so difficult to be ascertained Great men in the exercise of that ferocity taught in camps sometimes forget that clemency is the warrior's best virtue  So it happened to EDWARD who from a mistaken and miserable notion that it would be good policy to exterminate with the Welch every trace of their greatness massacred every poor unfortunate bard that could be found Upon another occasion he paid as little respect to the clergy for though he had no design upon their lives he had upon the means whereby they lived When the Pope exonerated them from paying most heavy taxes which were levied on them EDWARD refused them his temporal protection so that they were virtually outlaws and continually robbed and plundered by the peasantry who had permission to commit these outrages with impunity  Thus neither sacred nor profane actors stood much chance of encouragement Dramatic amusements however certainly at intervals went on and particularly those which were tolerated by JOHN and performed by the minstrels of CHESTER These were played at Whitsuntide and the different companies of traders were employed three days in the representation of them  These dramas were taken from the Old and New Testament and were full of the grossest busfoonery Each company had its particular play  The Creation  was performed by the Drapers  Abraham Melchisedec and Lot  by the Barbers  The Salutation and Nativity  by the Wrights  The Three Kings  by the Vintners  The Fall of Lucifer  by the Tanners  The Purification  by the Blacksmiths  The Deluge  by the Dyers  The sending of the Holy Ghost  by the Fishmongers  Moses Balack and Balaam  by the Cappers  The Oblation of the Three Kings  by the Mercers  The Shepherds feeding their Flocks by Night  by the Painters and Glaziers  The Killing of the Innocents  by the Goldsmiths  The Temptation  by the Butchers  Christ's Passion  by the Bowyers Fletchers and Ironmongers  Jesus and the Lepers  by the Corvesaries  Descent into Hell  by the Cooks and Innkeepers  Antichrist  by the Clothiers  The Ascension  by the Taylors  The Blindmen and Lazarus  by the Glovers  The Resurrection  by the Skinners and  The Day of Judgment  by the Websters  If this were taken literally we should see all the inhabitants of CHESTER in the capacity of actors but it is more probable that as CHESTER was a privileged place for these dramas the different companies employed certain actors to perform such pieces as were respectively allotted to them But these by no means entirely made up all the dramatic performances of the CHESTER actors for they had  interludes upon profane subjects and in particular several which related to earl RANDLE by whose interest as we have seen they originally became a privileged company regulated by a king or manager  These interludes in honour of RANDLE obtained without interruption till RICHARD the second but there are writers who strongly contend that the privelege granted by RANDLE was no more than a revival of one which had been given by LEOFRIC earl of CHESTER in the time of EDWARD the Confessor which seems indeed to infer that the Whitsun plays were performed at that early period for the grant was for three days during the Fair and so devoted were those days to sport and pleasure that even if a known thief came there so he committed no depredation on the spot he was to be privileged during that time from being apprehended    If EDWARD the first gave but little encouragement to the arts his son unlike his father in every other respect was equally unlike him in this for led about by his favourite GAVESTON and afterwards by the SPENSERS he went to the other extreme and encouraged every thing that was licentious In this strange irregular unquiet and dissolute reign however nothing could be expected to the honour of any human pursuit Both ENGLAND and FRANCE familiar with the horrid slaughter committed by the Saracens and Christians in the crusades and the fantastic and extravagant manner in which they celebrated their atchievements  on their return knew not whether in their pleasures or their cruelties how to be barbarous enough The Queen's unbridled passion for MORTIMER encouraged the profligacy of both and after the mutual abandoned pleasures and merciless butcheries which were finished by the king's shocking and detestable murder no wonder if so many loose and disorderly persons infested the kingdom that it became necessary in the following reign to restrain all kind of licentiousness and in particular the licentiousness of actors  CHAP VI FROM THE VAGRANT ACT OF EDWARD THE THIRD TO THE REGULATION OF THEATRES BY QUEEN ELIZABETH  THE continual struggles between holy and profane theatricals fluctuating sometimes in favour of the clergy and sometimes in favour of the laity arrived at length to such a profligate pitch that exactly as in ROME and in FRANCE it was thought expedient to suppress these representations altogether not however in the Roman manner by the punishment of death nor in the French manner by menacing damnation but in the true Grecian way by the discipline of the carts tail for early in the reign of EDWARD the third and about two hundred and fifty years after the conquest it was ordained by an act of parliament  "that a company of men called vagrants who had made masquerades throughout the whole city should be whipt out of LONDON because they represented scandalous things in little alehouses and other places where the populace assembled"  The necessity of this shews incontestibly that these scandalous doings had long been common and that whatever temporary checks they might have received from former kings they had now got to such an ungovernable degree of licentiousness that it required that serious intervention to stop their progress The operation of this interdiction was the same in ENGLAND as in FRANCE Interludes upon profane subjects were either performed by slealth or in private families upon certain festivals at weddings or other splendid entertainments These we are told were exhibited  "by ingenious tradesmen and gentlemens servants"  no doubt hired minstrels and that they were splendid or otherwise according to the condition of the person for whose entertainment they were performed that they were only permitted and always tacitly when they exposed vice or represented noble deeds in former times  And here it will be necessary to go a little into the spirit of the literature of those times in order to see what those interludes were During the long reign of EDWARD the third gallantry and elegance characterized his court the Order of the Carter was established and the repeated victories against the French introduced with their king and his retinue who were prisoners in ENGLAND every improvement  that the French had imbibed from their neighbours or taught themselves  The character of EDWARD was to give a polish to bravery and to soften the rigour of courage with the mildness of generosity and however ferocious the English are thought to have been at that time the single trait of that modest dignity that noble forbearance that generous solicitude in EDWARD the Black Prince when though young ambitious and enterprising he threw off every quality but beneficence in consoling and solacing his prisoner the king of FRANCE is enough to shew that the English were then capable of that refined honour which has never to the same pure disinterested and uncontaminated degree been the distinguishing characteristic of any other people  This struggle however between valour and benevolence engrossed the whole attention of the times The arts and sciences were therefore little known The gallantry of the English was confined to the exercise of open and manly exploits without a knowledge of the stratagems of war and if it had not been that the savour of some mistress was indispensibly necessary as a stimulus towards a conquest at a tournament a politeness and an attention to the fair would have but little marked the conduct  of the court of EDWARD Nay perhaps that provocation lady SALISBURY's garter would have been but a slight inducement to the establishment of that order had it not given an opportunity of reviving ARTHUR's round table  All this is neither more nor less than the entremets The interludes complained of in this reign were relieved by various sports Exercises of warlike feats on horseback with unarmed lances battles on the water curiously performed with shields and lances fighting of boars and bulls hunting and hawking In short we trace back to ALFRED so strong a similitude of this mixture of amusements that it is impossible to suppose they seldom existed separately In summer leaping dancing shouting wrestling casting the stone and practising the shield In winter bull and bearbeating feats on the ice or setting the boars together to fight which were intended for brawn All which sports the maidens accompanied with their timbrels But there was a sport in particular which prevailed greatly about the middle of the thirteenth century when the entremets were the rage in FRANCE it was called Running at the Quinten at which game exactly as in FRANCE whoever won was rewarded with a peacock    This of course checked materially the progress of literature nor would it probably have been much regarded had not a memorable combination of talents at that time distinguished themselves throughout EUROPE DANTE who was the panegyrist of the most celebrated troubadours and whose writings have a polish unknown before his time PETRARCH the scholar of DANTE whose poetry  thanks to love and LAURA had an inimitable tenderness in it and BOCCACE the scholar of PETRARCH who gave the Italian tongue that sweetness and grace which has ever since distinguished it from all other languages spread their genius their fancy and their elegance to every people capable of imbibing them  ENGLAND of course caught their influence and CHAUCER who was certainly a better poet than either of these and who has been held up by the English in the same degree of veneration as HOMER was with the Greeks and VIRGIL with the Romans was endowed with every susceptibility to add whatever he thought requisite of their refinements to his own admirable talents But this would be extraneous did it not tend to prove something dramatic to do which we have only to instance the  Decameron  of BOCCACE and the  Canterbuty Tales  of CHAUCER which contain an inexhaustible fund for all that can be done in comedy and unequivocally serve to shew that the drama was not only always known but always considered as the best vehicle for descriptive poetry because the subjects of the tales in the  Decameron  or at least many of them are taken from authors of former ages and adopted to the times and manners of the country in which BOCCACE wrote  This is again the case with CHAUCER who though he took subjects from BOCCACE which BOCCACE had borrowed before has given us a picture of our own times and manners so clearly that not a single character has escaped him and the various shades and distinctions of his descriptions are so nice so critical and so true to nature that no poet whose delineations of human life are faithful could avoid though he had never read CHAUCER being in some degree his imitator and what lesson after all do we learn from this but that nature is always the same has been always described and however affections and passions through the modes of times and manners may vary her operations yet the motives that regulate the mind are constant and invariable  After this it would be folly to say that CHAUCER could not have written a comedy or that BOCCACE could not or that any of those more ancient writers could not who furnished from writers still more ancient the source whence they drew their productions We have hitherto seen that authors have always borrowed of each other and we shall never see to the contrary and whether the thing itself be a vehicle in which characters are introduced and contrasted through the medium of narrative or  whether those characters are personated the only distinction is that both are dramatic but that only one is dramatized and therefore that either possesses all the requisites of the dramatic art  If then every thing dramatic was comprized in the works of CHAUCER and if LANGELAND's  Visions  a celebrated work and also some writings of GOWER both cotemporaries of CHAUCER were in the same spirit it is impossible but that the authors of interludes at that time must have availed themselves of such models especially as those authors were so numerous and in point of merit so obscure and thus CHAUCER a courtier and a great man GOWER a divine and LANGELAND a disciple of WICKLIFF gave their works that turn which was most likely to entertain the great and the erudite rather than amuse disorderly persons in little alehouses But to return  As the act for the punishing of vagrants was not in its spirit intended to check any thing that might encourage the growth of morality for surely nothing could be wiser than to suppress scandalous things performed in alehouses the clergy of ENGLAND feeling like the clergy of all other countries that instruction comes more welcome to the mind when it is received through the medium of  amusement prepared a stock of religious tragedies after the model of GEFFROI which there can be no doubt had continued to be tolerated from the time that the itinerant interludes were suppressed  The priests who were too cunning to incur a whipping established their sacred dramas exactly as GEFFROI had done his and as they were many of them heads of schools their scholars naturally became their actors which it is impossible to blame for they were by this means taught at once religion and elocution  A petition to king RICHARD the second in from the scholars of St PAUL's school puts this matter out of doubt for it shews that the religious plays had not only been long performed but that their success and celebrity were so great as to have induced others to attempt the same species of entertainment The petition prayed his majesty  "to prohibit a company of unexpert people from representing the History of the Old Testament to the great prejudice of the said clergy who bad been at great charge and expence to represent it publicly at Christmas"  This as SHAKESPEAR says denotes a soregone conclusion It positively implies that these clergy  by some means or other had obtained an exclusive right to perform these mysteries for upon what other presence could they petition the king to prohibit these opponents and this right of theirs must also have been pretty stable otherwise such a peremtory petition might have shaken it But what are these persons they wish to put down Why a set of  "unexpert people"  novices innovators who had not like these priests been long established and celebrated as performers of mysteries or as they call it of  "the History of the Old Testament"  Does not this clearly prove that as this company of holy actors were expert at their profession in the mysteries had been regularly performed in ENGLAND at St PAUL's school more perhaps many more than twenty years before they were performed in FRANCE in the Bourg of St MAUR where we first hear of them in Nay is it not very likely that in these clergy had performed as long with as good success and were as firmly established as the Confraternity of the Passion when as innovators they began to look with a jealous eye on the clerks of the Bazoche for we shall see that no longer than twelve years after this petition these mysteries were not only performed at Clerkenwell but attended by all the nobility and gentry  The accounts we have of this business are that the parish clerks of LONDON performed these mysteries first at Skinner's Well and afterwards at Clerkenwell or Clerk's Well which place took its name from this circumstance This however taken literally is a very strange conjecture The parish clerks of LONDON I believe have never been very celebrated for elocution and then they are by no means a community It is therefore much more feasible that these clerks were laybrothers of the church such as minorcanons who to this day in cathedrals sing themselves into their stalls just as counsellors eat their way to the bar  These might have called in the assistance of graduates and choirmen by which union we have instantly a number of performers whose habits of education give us a better idea of literary merit than without offence to the parish clerks who seem to have been grossly libelled in this business we should be likely to find in a set of old gentlemen from whom nothing more could be expected than to say Amen with a good grace Nor can any thing impeach the probability of this conjecture for the designation of every clergyman at this moment is clerk from the deacon to the prelate and in its extended clerical sense it implies all chantors  These gentlemen being generally in the vigour of life were very likely to excite the attention that we are told was actually paid them for whatever might have been the opinion of the clergy they so greatly prejudiced at St PAUL's school it turned out at last that they were so expert as to keep all the dramatic reputation to themselves  The clerks of the Bazoche which were no other than the lay clergy and the clerks of Clerkenwell will now appear so uniformly upon the same footing that their conduct and its operation were exactly alike They continued the mysteries only till they had carried their point till in proportion as the public taste became more polished and they grew weary of representing miracles from the Old and New Testament they introduced the moralities in which by personifying virtues and vices instead of saints and martyrs they insinuated a love of moral and social duty by appealing to the affections of the mind  It is a very singular coincidence that when the clerks of the Bazoche placed themselves under the protection of PHILIP LE BEL he regulated their community and chose from among them a head or director to whom he gave the title of their king exactly answering to our title of king of the minstrels    These moralities were not however at times  without a mixture of religius circumstances and characters In short they were sometimes wholly religious sometimes wholly mythological and sometimes both Innovations however of various kinds were attempted all which were of course imitated throughout the kingdom At length HAYWOOD HENRY the eighth's jester and his adherents like the children of Sans Souci introduced interludes representing the manners of persons in common life From these resulted something like regular plays which excited so much curiosity that the whole kingdom swarmed with actors till at length after many fruitless attempts to suppress them they were entirely put down by queen ELIZABETH with a view to select such parts of this chaos as might form a natural theatrical world  But to trace the steps that led to this regulation RICHARD the second having countenanced the mysteries at Clerkenwell HENRY the fourth his successor who had reason enough to keep the people in good humour that they might the easier forget by what means he came at the crown permitted this indulgence to the fullest extent for he was frequently present at these exhibitions with the queen and all the nobles of his court and particularly to witness a performance which lasted eight days and which took its story from the creation of the world  This toleration was however of course very much abused for the people became so mad after these mysteries that they were presently performed all over the kingdom We hear of theatres upon wheels exactly like the cart of THESPIS being drawn about COVENTRY and other places in which the fairs exhibited scenes and represented pageants upon CorpusChristi day the stories always from the Old and New Testament and composed in Enlish rhime  There is a manuscript in the Cottonian library from which we learn the arguments of forty pageants or gesticulations representing all the histories of both the Old and New Testament from the creation to St MATTHIAS the apostle Among the latter we find  The Annunciation The Nativity The Visitation The Resurrection  and  The Ascension  Nay  The Assumption  and  Last Judgment  All these were performed in a style of which we shall by and by see some specimens infinitely unworthy and beneath the sacred subjects they treated a circumstance which will clearly shew that these mysteries were performed very early when we compare them to those written by BALE SANDYS and others who wrote in the sixteenth century  These various performers were called wastors  masterrimours minstrels and players of interludes who had overrun the kingdom and reached even to WALES and it was enacted that none of these nor any other vagabonds should be sustained or suffered in the land of WALES or elsewhere to make commoiths or gatherings upon the people by which it may be understood that they gave notice to all within such a district that they performed for money Among the appellation other vagabonds were probably included fencers bearwards and mummers which last description at different times have been known to infest the kingdom Their custom was to dress themselves in a grotesque manner and to dance mimic and shew tricks of legerdemain all which the English had retained ever since the mimes of the Romans for it is remarked that they went about masqued and disguised and were frequently guilty of many lewd and outrageous disorders  This interdiction seems to have had some effect for a time for we find here as in FRANCE when printing was known and books began to multiply which was in the reign of HENRY the sixth literature became more refined and the only deviation from the mysteries and moralities except among such as chose to run the risk of offending against the law was a sort of revival of the entrements for we  scarcely ever hear of the reception of princes or noble persons but that pageants on stages erected in the open streets made a part of the entertainments We gather from an ancient manuscript at COVENTRY called the old leet book that on the feast of the exaltation of the Holy Cross MARGUERITTE the queen of HENRY the sixth with her young son prince EDWARD came there and was welcomed with many pageants and speeches  The characters in this curious spectacle were St EDWARD supposed to be the godfather of EDWARD the CONFESSOR St JOHN the Evangelist and St MARGARET St EDWARD tells Dame MARGUERITTE that he shall pray for her and his ghostly child and he gives St JOHN a ring that he may pray for her also who apor this tells her that he'll be her bedeman and that to use his own words  The vertuous voice of prince EDWARD shall dayly well encrease  St EDWARD his godfader and I shall pray therefore doubtlese    In the next reign as the same book inform us the young prince EDWARD son to king EDWARD the fourth came to COVENTRY and was received in the same manner  Upon the second occasion St EDWARD had another very fine speech and so had St GEORGE and the book further tells us that  "also upon the Condite in the Cross Cheping was St GEORGE armed and a king's daughter afore him with a lamb and the sader and the moder being in a towre aboven beholding St GEORGE saving their daughter from the dragon and the condite renning wine in four places and minstralcy of organ playing and St GEORGE having this speech under writted  O mighty GOD our all succour celestiall  Which this Royme has given in dower  To thy moder and to me GEORGE protection perpetuall  It to defend from enimys fer and nere  And as this mayden defended was here  By thy grace from this dragon's devour  So Lord preserve this noble prince and ever be his socour  and there were many more  entertainments of this description in various parts of the kingdom that might be noticed but I shall content myself with mentioning only one of a later date and in a more magnificent style It was occasioned by the marriage of prince ARTHUR eldest son of king HENRY the seventh to the princess CATHERINE of SPAIN whose entrance into LONDON was very grand and splendid The pageants were many and costly and the speakers represented various characters such as St CATHERINE St URSULA a Senator Noblesse Virtue an Angel king ALPHONSO JOB BOESIUS and others  When the speaking was ended  "she held on her way"  says an old manuscript  "tyll she came unto the standard in Chepe where was ordeyned the fifth pagend made like an hevyn theryn sytting a personage representing the fader of hevyn being all formyd of gold and brennying beffor his trone vii candyilis of wax standying in vii candy

frutys I shall encrease and multyply  Yower rebellious enimyes I shall put in yowr hand  Encreasing in honour both yow and youwr land  Though the forgoing speech is to the last degree profane and indecent I could not refrain from giving it at length to shew what was tolerated in those times not only by the king but by priests and philosophers for bishop Fox had the management of this extraordinary spectacle who lord BACON tell us was upon that oc+casion a good surveyor of works and a good master of ceremonies and BACON himself says that  "whosoever had those toys in compiling were not altogether pedantical"    Though these strange faragoes wore very little however  the resemblance of plays the interludes which had been variously performed in defiance of the law gave no mean idea of them and these when HENRY the eighth meditated the demolition of the monasteries received such sanction and encouragement from HEYWOOD who being the king's jester was permitted to change the face of theatrical amusements as gave the mysteries and moralities too a severe shock from which they never afterwards recovered  It is true that in the reign of HENRY the eighth there was an act against mummers but it was soon understood to extend only to such as wore masks and as the disposition of the times was to second  every proceeding against priests this very act served to check the moralities and encourage the interludes for the priests or representers of moralities were now called stage players and it is probable these performances would have been from that moment totally done away had not an attempt been made to revive them in the reign of queen MARY who however gloomy and superstitious as she was and willing to abet priests did not much encourage them nor if she had done so could she have been materially serviceable to them her reign being so short  In the mean time furnished with what HEYWOOD had written and procured the interludes grew very much upon the public till  Gammer Gurton's Needle  written not long after the  Pageant  just now described which though low was very nearly a regular comedy fairly shaped these interludes into plays But this was not all for dramatic writers who perfectly well knew their art began upon the fall of the mysteries and moralities to appear HENRY PARKER son to sir WILLIAM PARKER is said to have written several tragedies and comedies JOHN HOKER wrote a comedy called  Piscator or the Fisher Caught  but of these and others who succeeded them I shall hereafter  give a particular account in the mean time I shall pursue the history of the theatre generally  As the darling wish of HENRY's heart was to establish the Protestant religion no wonder he did every thing in his power to suppress the influence of the Roman Catholics and as he well knew that by striking at their dominion over the minds of the people by means of these amusements he should complete that reform which perhaps would not have been entirely effected by pulling down the monasteries he encouraged all such plays as tended to promote his designs and interdicted all others which very plainly appears by an act passed in the twentyfourth year of his reign called an Act of Parliament for promoting true Religion in which there was a clause restraining all rimours or players from singing in songs or playing in interludes any thing that should contradict the established doctrines  This struck at the mysteries at once which at all times by representing  The Creator Our Saviour  and the  Saints and Martyrs  had been considered as profane and blasphemous The moralities were also weeded of all that had the same dangerous tendency and therefore became so fame that the interludes which were soon formed into tragedies  and comedies gave the public a truer taste for the stage  The only evil to be apprehended from this was the increase of actors and the inclination of the public to run after them It appears evidently that dramatic writers who well knew their profession lived at that time and soon after for among others we are told of EDWARD FERRYS who was celebrated in the time of EDWARD the sixth and  "who"  says his panegyrist  "was a man of no less mirth and felicity than JOHN HEYWOOD but of much more skill and magnificence in his metre and therefore wrote for the most part to the stage in tragedy and sometimes in comedy or interludes wherein he gave the king so much good recreation as he had thereby many good rewards"  The actors now having full opportunity to represent any thing even upon profane subjects that was not immoral exactly as it happened some time after in FRANCE became numerous as they became celebrated and would perhaps have established the drama upon a firm and permanent footing had not the gloom thrown over the nation during the short but sanguinary reign of MARY forced them  like so many timid hares to cover to escape from those inquisitorial blood hounds who perhaps might have thought proper to misconstrue their representations of vice and folly into heresy  No sooner however did the English horizon emancipate from that obscurity with which it had been dimmed by the horrid and sanguinary bonfires in Smithfield than all the social blessings that the people had so ardently panted for were sought with double relish The reform of HENRY though meritorious had been enforced the reformation of ELIZABETH was voluntary Never perhaps was there such an epoch in the annals of the world The whole nation was in smiles Their sovereign born to bless and protect them was received as a benediction from heaven Oppression was no more Moderation was restored Learning and the arts acknowledged their congenial soil and the land in a few years received the polish of centuries  ELIZABETH had too much good sense to restrain plays She did not chuse however to let them run riot but still they were checked with a very sparing hand till the licentious use made of this lenity obliged her seriously to set about a reform in  the theatre as she had done in the church We are told that plays became the occasion of much sin and evil that great multitudes of people of both sexes resorted to those plays and that on account of their being acted on Sundays and festivals the churches were forsaken and the playhouses thronged  We are further told that great inns were used for this purpose which had secret chambers and places as well as open stages and galleries that in those places maids and the children of good citizens were inveigled and allured to secret and illicit intercourse that these players uttered unchaste and unworthy sentiments and were guilty of many other enormities In short after the playhouses were tacitly permitted in process of time they became little better than brothels It was therefore thought expedient first to suppress plays entirely but as it was evident that amusements of this nature upon a well regulated plan might be rendered a benefit to society instead of an evil the lord mayor sir JAMES HAWES by the command of the queen issued an act of common council to this effect  That no play should be openly enacted within the liberty of the city wherein should be uttered  any words examples or doings of unchastity sedition or such like unfit and uncomely matter under pain of forfeiture of five pounds for every such offence  That no innkeeper tavernkeeper or other person whatsoever within the said liberties should permit such play to be performed within his house or yard which should not first be perused and allowed by the lord mayor and court of aldermen  That no persons should be permitted to perform but such as were allowed and approved of by the lord mayor and court of aldermen  All such persons to be bound in a penalty to the chamberlain of LONDON  No play to be performed on any Sunday or holiday under the penalty of five pounds  All performers allowed approved of and licenced as aforesaid to pay for the use of the poor in the city hospitals such sums as the lord may or and the court of aldermen should approve of or otherwise lose their licence  All sums levied to be applied as above for  which upon refusal the chamberlain of LONDON might sue in the mayor's court  These laws which were made in were not strictly observed for the licentiousness of plays encreased and they were thought dangerous to religion to the morals of the people and to the state The theatres were so crouded that they were supposed to promote infection in times of confluent sickness therefore after much debate upon the subject they were wholly suppressed  Upon a representation however of the queen's players and the players of noblemen and gentlemen it was again permitted that they might hold themselves in readiness to play at weddings and other festivals at private houses or the lodgings of any nobleman gentleman or citizen where no correction of money was to be made from the audience but not in public assemblies but this toleration was soon extended again in favour of the queens players who were however to be restricted to the laws formerly issued in the mayoralty of sir JAMES HAWES  They were however forbid to commence their entertainments till the deaths should be for twenty days together under fifty a week and they were immediately  to leave off when they should again amount to more than that number all which was under an idea as before that the crouds at the theatres promoted infection No plays were to be performed on a Sunday or a holiday till after evening prayer nor then after dark nor to continue longer than to give the auditors time to return home before sun set or at least before dark and this indulgence at last was extended to the queen's players but no more of them were to enjoy at than those whose names were notified in the lord treasurer's letters to the lord mayor and the justices of MIDDLESEX and SURRY and even those her majesty's players were forbid to divide themselves into different companies and for breaking any of those orders their toleration was to cease  But all this was not sufficient to keep them within bounds for their plays were sometimes so offensive to virtue and morality and so full of abuse of different persons that they were now and then stopt and prohibited till at length they so completely set the laws at defiance that HART the mayor in complained to the lord treasurer and by his authority as there were many companies belonging to noblemen sent for all the players in town without exception and forbid them to perform till further orders  These further orders were however very soon issued for there were presently three established theatres which were known by the names of the Theatre the Fortune and the Curtine where we are told they performed comedies tragedies interludes and histories both true and feigned and it is reasonable to suppose that after this last prohibition they pretty well conformed to the regulations enjoined them for only eight years afterwards an act passed in which are these words  "That all persons that be or utter themselves to be procters procurers patent gatherers or collectors for goals prisons or hospitals or fencers bearwards common players of interludes or minstrels wandering abroad other than players of interludes belonging to any baron of this realm or any other honourable personage of greater degree to be authorized to play under the hand and seal of such baron or personage all juglers tinkers pedlars and petty chapmen wandering abroad c These shall be adjudged and deemed rogues vagabonds and sturdy beggars and punished as such"  I have given the spirit of the whole clause to shew in what company strolling actors were placed The exemption in favour of the actors retained by  barons and higher persons clearly went to all those who performed in LONDON and as we know not of any further prohibition owing of course to the very rapid improvement of the stage under that galaxy of merit which appeared about this time to enlighten literature no wonder it soon attained such perfection as classed the English theatre infinitely forwarder than any other in the world  CHAP VII MYSTERIES AND MORALITIES  BOTH for the sake of historical intelligence and to gratify particular curiosity I shall now look after the mysteries moralities and interludes and shew in what way by graduating from religion to mythology from mythology to allegory and from allegory to nature they at last improved into tragedies and comedies  Having given so particular an account of the nature of the mysteries and moralities in FRANCE it will be less necessary to dwell upon those that were performed early in ENGLAND They may however here as there be distinguished into miracles such as were anathematized in FRANCE by SULLI and brought forward in ENGLAND by GEFFROI mysteries which were performed by the Confraternity of the Passion and the boys of St PAUL's school and moralities which were improvements  introduced by the English and French society of clerks  For proof of the miracles and that they obtained very early we have not only  The Miracle of St Catherine  by GEFFROI but accounts of others that were performed in different parts of the kingdom answering exactly to RABELAIS's story of VILLON who the reader may remember had a curious adventure with the  Cordeliers  of POITOU We are told of  Guary Miracles  which were performed in CORNWALL and that many people flocked from great distances to see them  "for"  says the author who wrote in the reign of ELIZABETH and was then giving an account of what he considered as antiquities  "they had therein devils and devices as well to delight the eye as the ear"  These guary miracles one of which was called  The Creation of the World  and another  Mount Calverie  were performed upon the principles of the original Grecian amphitheatre in temporary buildings formed in the open fields the diameter of the inclosure being generally about fifty feet and it is extremely probable the custom being certainly very ancient this might be the kind of theatre spoken of so confidently and in so unqualified a  manner at the time when according to BOADICEA NERO introduced fiddling into BRITAIN  As to the mysteries the very titles of them prove that they came from the same source whence our neighbours derived theirs  The Possion of Our Saviour  which the French confess to have been written so early that they know not with whom it originated  The Conception The Incarnation  and others to a very large number shew sufficiently we were not behind hand in these religious farces There are a great many of them extant some few of which it will be necessary to touch upon but as it would clog up the narrative to seek for those of which we cannot possibly know any thing except by conjecture it will be better at once to come to such as have been acknowledged by well known authors but who after all appear to have drawn them from a very remote source  Of these authors one of the most respectable is BALE He was born in in SUFFOLK and at twelve years old went to the monastery of Carmelites at NORWICH He afterwards studied at Hulme Abbey in NORTHUMBERLAND and was from thence removed to CAMBRIDGE He became a Protestant and was in consequence persecuted by the Roman Catholics but he was protected by lord CROMWELL  However on that nobleman's death he took shelter in HOLLAND where he wrote or probably translated most of his dramatic productions He was recalled in the reign of EDWARD the sixth and given the living of BISHOP's STOKE in HAMPSHIRE He was afterwards named to the See of OSSORY where he strenuously exerted himself to reform his priests and abolish mass in consequence of which some of his servants were murdered and his own death was plotted He therefore made his escape in a small boat and was taken by the captain of a Dutch man of war who stript him of all his money and effects From HOLLAND he retired to SWITZERLAND where he continued during the reign of queen MARY When ELIZABETH came to the throne he returned to ENGLAND but could never be prevailed upon to return to his see but preferred rather being a prebend of CANTERBURY where he died in the year before SHAKESPEAR was born  BALE wrote seventeen dramatic pieces of which those under are the titles  Of Gods Promises The Baptism of Christ The Temptation Christ when he was twelve Years Old Of the Lord's Supper Of the Passion of Christ Of the Resurrection Of Lazarus raised from the Dead Of Simon the Leper  are mysteries  The Treachery of the Papists The Impostures  of Thomas Becket Against those who adulterate the Word of God  and  The Corruptions of the Divine Laws  are moralities  Upon both Marriages of the King Against Momuses and Zoiluses Of John of England  and  The Image of Love  are plays  All these performances except three of the mysteries are lost to the world These however are pretty well preserved and as I shall presently instance in one of them that BALE was a man of sound learning and by no means for his time a bad poet we have great reason to believe that his plays were greatly superior to that insufferable nonsense  Gammer Gurton's Needle  which by the way though execrably written is a perfect play and not without humouror any of those other faragoes which the human mind can hardly afford belief were written only forty years before SHAKESPEAR's productions began to illumine literature  The mystery I allude to is entitled  A tragedy or interlude manyfesting the chese promises of God unto man by all ages in the old lawe from the fall of Adam to the incarnacyon of Christ  This piece holds out a positive proof that BALE and therefore of course other writers of that time well knew the ancients for it is not in five acts a number which if we are well informed the ancients never used but  seven acts in which their pieces were often written and to make the similitude more perfect each act finishes with a chorus performed as the choruses of the ancients were by voices and instruments the aggregate length also as well as the proportion of the different divisions is exactly managed upon the Greek model for their tragedies in seven acts do not contain more matter than is generally found in three acts of any English tragedy The  Oedipus Tyrannus  of SOPHOCLES which is one of the longest of antiquity has not so many lines by two hundred and fifty including the choruses as one of our shortest  ARISTOTLE who stole as judiciously as VOLTAIRE observes by way of a discovery in the words of PLATO by the bye who would probably have told us with great simplicity that the observation had been long an axiom that an action should consist of beginning middle and end and this no doubt is certainly true of all literary conpositions whatever from an epigram to an epic poem The ancients therefore not because it was ARISTOTLE's advice for many of them wrote before him in general either divided their plays into three acts or six but as the middle action was sometimes intricate for from its nature it ought to involve the piece in that perplexity which leaves the spectator in doubt as to how it shall finish they took the third fourth and fifth acts to have a wide field by which means the first and second were found fully sufficient for the first action which opens the plot and excites the spectators curiosity and the sixth and seventh for relieving him from that pleasant embar+rassment into which the middle action has worked upon his mind by a gradual a happy and a natural catastrophe It is on this account they totally rejected fi  e acts which the French and the English have adopted because it was recommended by HORACE Reason however who after all knows more than all the critics who ever wrote or cavilled which is the same thing says that if there are three distinct actions there should be no more than three dis  nct divisions and if the middle in point of interest should require to be more heightened than the rest gave the second act a little extension and there is an end of the business If any should doubt this let him acconcile himself by reading the operas of METASTASIO    As to the writing of this piece it is crude enough but as it is full of those beautiful sentiments which every where pervade the scriptures and evidently written by a good man and a philosopher it cannot by any means be considered as an indifferent performance at the same time there is something shocking in introducing the Creator threatening ADAM commanding NOAH blessing ABRAHAM instructing MOSES promising DAVID encouraging ISAIAH and sanctifying JOHN the Baptist and yet the whole forms a complete plot beginning with original sin and finishing with man's redemption  It is very probable as I hinted before that this piece was a translation for I now shall speak of another which I have by me as it was originally printed with a preface and dedication a good deal illustrative of this probable fact that most of the ancients translated or imitated from something still more ancient This piece is a mystery written by SANDYS and called  Christ's Passion    SANDYS who we are told was a very accomplished gentleman was youngest son of EDWIN archbishop of YORK and born in this mystery therefore that he translated was of course never performed but I mention it to shew the antiquity of that kind of spectacle In his dedication which is to the king he speaks of it as coming immediately to him from the pen of GROTIUS and to GROTIUS from APOLLINARIUS and NAZIANZEN two ancient fathers of the primitive church In this preface are these words  I know of nothing so hurtful to literature as the present fashion of suppressing prefaces and dedications in which writers always express their strongest and happiest thoughts There are hundreds of instances that when literary compositions become the property of all mankind the reputation of authors is sacrificed to the profit of the booksellers Compression is become as much the study of Paternoster Row as the theatre and every nerve is strained to cram the author at one place into a nutshell and at the other into a pocket volume The prefaces and dedications of DRYDEN are full of beautiful prose conveying interesting and elegant instruction The mind of a great man like this developed in a succession of opinions the result of his feeling and the confirmation of his judgment is a treasure of which the world ought not to be deprived    "The tragedy of  Christ's Passion  was first written in Greek by APOLLINARIUS of LAODICEA bishop of HIEROPOLIS and after by GREGORY NANZIANZEN"  Though this now extant in his is by  some ascribed to the former by others accounted supposititious as not agreeing with his strain in the rest of his poems which might alter that particular upon the imitation of EURIPIDES But HUGO GROTIUS of late hath transcended all on this argument whose steps afar off I follow  As this piece though much more irregular as to its conduct is better written than that of BALE I suspect it to have been of greater antiquity especially as this is the subject which the French are not able to trace to its source Thus to reconcile this apparent solecism the plot which is crude and incongruous has remained without alteration and the style by getting into different hands has acquired a brighter polish The subject is much better calculated for representation than the other the characters one excepted being less revolting The choruses however which are chiefly performed by Jewish women are not managed according to any rule They are not like those before AESCHYLUS which contained the main action nor after when they only relieved the main action They seem rather what SOPHOCLES introduced and EURIPIDES afterwards altered for though they are not primary objects they certainly were composed of characters which had relation to the principal  interest of the piece I mention this to shew that all these writers had the ancients in view in every thing  SANDYS however so far conformed to the fashion of the times in which he wrote as to adopt five acts in preference to any other given number and if the prodigious length of the speeches did not tire the reader intolerably and more the spectator the whole being little more than a succession of monologues the historical facts attending upon that event and the situation of the characters particularly of PILATE who is made to feel as a man while he acts as a governor would give the piece a consequence and an interest that might not disgrace later and more perfect productions  We can trace these mysteries to a variety of authors most of whom appeared to have translated their plays from either the Greek Latin Italian French or German but as the subject requires to be no farther treated than merely to prove the existence and antiquity of these amusements I shall be as brief as possible  JHAN PARFRE wrote or translated in a mystery called  Candlemas Day or the Killing of  the Children of Israel  RADCLIFF wrote  Dives and Lazarus Job's Affliction The Burning of Sodom The Delivery of Susannah  and  The Fortitude of Judith  WAGER lived in the reign of ELIZABETH and is called a learned clerk He wrote  The Life and Repentance of Mary Magdalen  A mystery or religious tragedy was translated from the Italian of BOSSENTINUS by HENRY CHEEKE called  Freewill  where is set forth in manner of tragedy the devilish devices of the Popish religion PEELE of whom it will be necessary presently to speak wrote  The Love of King David and Fair Bathsheba  with the tragedy of  Absalom  and GOLDING translated  Abraham sacrificing his Son Isaac  from BEZA  Many more authors might be named and many more pieces which though the authors are unknown were entered at Stationer's Hall There is scarcely however a play but manifests from some circumstance or other that it came from something written antecedent to the time in which it appeared and as I shall hereafter be able more particularly to ascertain the origin of the moralities and the old tragedies and comedies and we shall then find from circumstances a full confirmation of this fact it may not be amiss to take leave of the mysteries by giving a short specimen of their language  In BALE's mystery of  God's Promises  is the following colloquy between the CREATOR and ADAM I take the passage at hazard  Adam primus homo  Mercyfull Father thy pytiefull grace extende  To me carefull wretche whych have me sore abused  Thy precept breakynge O Lord I mynde to amende  If thy great goodnesse wolde now have me excused  Most heavenlye Maker let me not be refused  Nor cast from thy syght for one pore synnefull

left to myne owne lyberte  Pater coelestis  Then thu art blamelesse and the saulte thu layest to me  Adam primus homo  Naye all I ascribe to my own imbecyllyte  No faulte in the Lorde but in my

the last  That sede shall clere the of all thy wyckednesse past  And procure thy peace with most high grace in my fyght  Se thu trust to it and holde not the matter lyght  In SANDYS's tragedy of  Christ's Passion  will be found this passage the first that came in my way  PILATE  A sight so full of pity may assuage  The swiftly spreading fire of popular rage  Look on this spectacle his arms all o're  With lashes gall'd deep dy'd in their own gore  His sides exhausted all the rest appears  Like that fictitious scarlet which he wears  And for a crown the wreathed thorns infold  His bleeding brows with grief his grief behold  JEWS  Away with him from th  s contagion free  Th' infected earth and  il him on a tree  PILATE  What crucifie your king  JEWS  dominion can  No rival brook His rule a law to man  Whom ROME adores we readily obey  And will admit of none but CAESAR's sway  He CAESAR's right usurps who hopes to ascend  The Hebrew throne Thy own affairs intend  Dost thou discharge thy master's trust if in  Thy government a president begin  So full of danger tending to the rape  Of majesty Shall treason thus escape  PILATE  The tumult swells the vulgar and the great  Joyn in their votes with contributed heat  Whose whisperings such a change of murmur raise  As when the rising wind's first fury strays  'Mong wave beat rocks when gatherings clouds deform  The face of heaven whose wrath begets a storm  The fearful pilot then distrusts the skies  And to the nearest port for refuge flies  To these rude clamours they mine ears inure  Such sharp diseases crave a sudden cure  You my attendants hither quickly bring  Spotpurging water from the living spring  Thou liquid chrystal from pollution clear  And you my innocent hands like record bear  On whom these cleansing streams so purely run  I voluntarily have nothing done  Nor am I guilty though he guiltless dye  Yours is the crime his blood upon you lie  JEWS  Rest thou secure If his destruction shall  Draw down celestial vengeance let it fall  Thick on our heads in punishment renew  And ever our dispersed race pursue  From these specimens the reader will easily form an idea not only of the two writers but of the manner in which these subjects were generally treated BALE's mystery written clearly by a divine was  one of that description performed by the priests SANDYS gave himself the latitude of a poet and therefore though his piece is on a sacred subject the characters suit the laity This was one shadow of that distinction by which the mysteries gradually changed into moralities a species of entertainment however intolerably dull though frequently well written for though allegory requires the powers of a poet example alone enforces the practice of virtue from the stage A metaphor may convince me through the medium of imaginary characters that clemency is a beautiful virtue but let me be shewn an actual instance of it by some circumstance like the introduction of TITUS and I instantly see not only its beauty but its practicability  The moralities were generally written to serve some temporary purpose Sometimes they enforced public opinions as the comedy of  Good Order  written by SKELTON sometimes to promote obedience and conformity to the laws like that called  The New Custom  the author not known written expressly to vindicate and promote the Reformation sometimes especially when they were written for families they recommended an attention to the ordinary pursuits of life and illustrated the advantages of social duty of this class were  The Disobedient Child  by INGELAND a very early writer  and  Acolastus or the Prodigal Son  by PALSGRAVE The ground work of which pieces we have seen in the early part of the French stage particularly  Acolasius  which came from the celebrated play of RUTEBEUF from which so many authors have pillaged and among them VOLTAIRE PALSGRAVE however who was chaplain to HENRY the eighth seems to have had a Latin play written by FULLONIUS in his idea and in his style he endeavoured to imitate both PLAUTUS and TERENCE  Others of these moralities promoted learning and the principles of education such are the nature of the  Four Elements  supposed to be written by RASTALL which among other branches of instruction illustrates many points of natural philosophy and necromantia compiled by SKELTON first in Greek afterwards translated into Latin and then into English for the use of those who might with to learn different languages  The laudable drift therefore of these performances of which these may serve as a few proofs is very apparent but the world wanted to be amused as well as taught and this led to the introduction of plays which being undertaken by scholars perfectly well acquainted with the ancients we instantly observe whatever other requisites they may want  the early comedies and tragedies are astonishly regular for the time  But to dwell a little longer upon the moralities These strange representations were so managed that though they consisted of a great variety of characters they might be performed by four or five persons In one of them called  All for Money  which was described as  "a moral and pityful comedy plainly representing the manners of men and the fashion of the world"  the characters are Theology Science Art Money Adulation Godly Admonition Mischievous Help Pleasure Pressed for Pleasure Sin Swift to Sin Virtue Humility Charity All for Money Damnation Satan Pride Gluttony Learning with Money Learning without Money Money without Learning Neither Money nor Learning Moneyless Moneyless and Friendless Nychol Gregory Graceless Mother Crook Judas Dives William and the two Wives but as not more than two of these characters or at most three were ever on the stage at once and when they generally disappeared they were seen no more several parts were taken by one person without any injury to the piece  I have instanced here one of the latest on purpose  to shew that as the mysteries became partly moralities so at last the moralities became partly plays for Nychol Gregory Graceless Mother Crook c are not allegorical but real characters On the contrary in those of an earlier date one of which is called  Every Man  we find the Creator in company with Death Fellowship Kindred Knowledge Strength and Beauty Before this morality we find the following advertisement  "Here begynneth a treatyse how the hye Father of Heven sendeth dethe to somon every creature to come and gyve a counte of theyr lyves in this worlde and is in maner of a moralle playe"  But it is extremely difficult to trace the moralities to their source RASTALL a famous typographer from onward to when he died either wrote revived or translated many of them All those to which no authors' names are affixed it is natural to suppose are of this description SKELTON poet lauret to HENRY the eighth is the earliest name we can find who besides those that have been noticed wrote  Magnificence  a goodly interlude and a mery The  Negromansir  printed in and the comedy of  Virtue    The story of the  Negromansir  which was performed before HENRY the seventh and his nobles  on Palm Sunday greatly to their edification no doubt was the trial of SIMONY which is supposed to be a female One of the characters quotes SENECA and St AUSTIN and tells this lady to offer the Devil a bribe The Devil who enters with a large beard rejects her offer with the utmost indignation and swears that she shall be fried and roasted in sulphur with MAHOMET PONTIUS PILATE the traitor JUDAS and king HEROD The last scene is a view of Hell where the Devil dances with the Necromancer till after tripping up his heels he leaves him in astonishment and disappears in smoke and sulphur  After SKELTON we have MEDWALL chaplain to MERTON cardinal and archbishop of CANTERBURY who wrote a morality called  Nature  GASCOIGNE who translated a morality from ARIOSTO called  Supposes  and wrote another called  The Glasse of Government  WOODS who produced  The Conflict of Conscience  TARLETON author of  The Seven Deadly Sins  and others besides those of BALE already mentioned But there are many published by RASTALL which are supposed to have been of a very early date indeed among these may be reckoned  Gentlynese and Nobylite Impacyente Poverte Manhood and Wisdome The Marriage of Wit and Science  and several others  Perhaps it may be wrong to dwell so minutely on the subject of these representations Many of which were miserable trash and the best but fanciful and fantastic rhapsodies calculated one should think more for drolls and puppetshews than to make up the delight of kings and courts but as they served to insinuate morality under this homely and grotesque form which alone the people were willing to approve they so far fulfilled the purposes of the stage and sobered the public mind into that degree of discrimination which taught the English to admire perfection on the theatre sooner than any other nation after the Greeks  It is impossible to conceive any thing fuller of impiety than the mysteries taken literally but it must be remembered that the ostentateous ceremonies of the church which have pretty well kept pace with them have ensured an attention to the church itself which perhaps would have been vainly enjoined by admonition or compelled by severity What wonder then the priests should act in concert with the play ers It cannot also be denied that private duty enforced by either the persuasions or the menaces of a parent or a preceptor seldom exhibits any other than a melancholy prospect of success but when instruction wears the lovely form and assumes the alluring garb of pleasure youth is  lattered into  duty and cheated into virtue The stern vizor of rigour falls off and the face of reason appears chearful and complacent  It is on this account awkward rude and boorish as they have managed it I cannot find reason to doubt that the world at all times and this of course as well as every other country have adopted some insinuating mode similar to this to ensure by mildness an attention to social intercourse and mutual interest which menace could never have effected and whether sports music dancing reciting or singing of poetry relating histories true or invented or any others of these numerous tubs with which human creatures as well as whales must be amused have at any time prevented depredations averted insurrections and secured the bounds of good fellowship the whole has been stage effect and therefore virtually an encouragement of the dramatic art  Will it be insisted that if there had been no amusements of that kind which we now call tragedies and comedies the theatre properly speaking would have had no existence No such thing can be advanced Mysteries and moralities were tragedies and comedies as far as they went for though the mind accommodates itself better to imitate  virtue by a review of the actions of those with whom history has brought us acquainted or to shun folly through an exposition of those absurdities apparent to us in the actions of our common acquaintance yet the drift of the other amusements was the same the times however were not polished enough to promulgate instruction in any other form and therefore they held out symbol instead of certainty  CHAP VIII INTERLUDES AND REMARKS CONCERNING THEM AND THEIR AUTHORS  THE term interlude is so indefinite and has been so variously appropriated that it has at times applied to every species of dramatic entertainment both sacred and prophane There can be no doubt but that its fair vernacular sense is some farce or other stage performance introduced between intervals at feasts therefore when it came to have a fixed and determinate signification it had not the smallest resemblance to what was originally understood as interlude  In companies it has been the custom to give a song and a toast alternately nay in clubs we shall still find telling stories preaching Quakers sermons repeating scenes from plays imitating puppets dressing a fist like an old woman and make it apparently sing a song in character and a prodigious number of modes of mumming in this way These  are interludes as far as they go and fairly give an idea of what were those amusements performed in little alehouses which occasioned the Vagrant Act of EDWARD the third  Nothing therefore of the dramatic kind taken in this sense is so ancient as interlude The tragedies and comedies of the Greeks as they have been considered according to their original sense of religious and pastoral the Fescennines of the Romans the Jornadas of the Spaniards the Canvasses of the Italians the Sirventes and Tensons of the French and the irregular mixture of them all among the English were interludes a term meaning pieces performed theatrically to amuse and instruct sometimes large and sometimes select companies nor were they till HEYWOOD and those other authors about his time considered in a fixed and distinct sense signifying a regular dramatic piece one shadow only from a play for as the m  steries promulgated religion through the medium of impiety and the moralities taught social duty by the personification of those virtues men ought to imitate and those vices they ought to avoid the interludes such as they were understood to be at that time consisted of characters which really existed who discoursed on subjects most proper to enforce the duties which prudence reason and even policy recommended  So far they were dramatic entertainments but still they were not plays for the moral was enforced by precept and not by example A representation of characters in real life which were immediately concerned in the interest of the action that was going forward which as they contributed to bring about the ends of justice and morality were rewarded and which as they thwarted and perverted those ends were punished was a species of theatrical amusement then entirely unknown though all the essential requisites of it had been always the drift of whatever had been brought forward yet will this militate against any thing already here asserted for it is impossible to contend that because an art had not arrived to perfection it had not therefore been exercised  It may not now be amiss to blend with those interludes some particulars concerning the men who wrote them among whom the name of JOHN HEYWOOD stands most conspicuous He seems to have been a man of great wit and pleasantry and very well calculated to innovate as he did upon the mysteries and moralities but his mind being too extensive and his genius too volatile to buckle to the trammels of a university education he neglected to polish those talents which nevertheless he was certainly  endowed with and therefore probably he was not considered as a person of sufficient consequence to effect a complete reform  His abilities were however held in considerable respect and he became by his pleasant and agreeable wit a great favourite with many eminent men of that time and particularly with sir THOMAS MORE who delighted in his company and introduced him to the princess MARY through  Sir THOMAS MORE whose extraordinary talents whose unshaken rectitude and whose brilliant wit and amiable manners made him the admiration of the good and wise and the envy of the deceitful and malignant who ornamented the state dignified the laws delighted society and gave a polish to manners and who suffered death through the ingratitude of a master whom he had too honestly served for his own safety This sir THOMAS MORE was both the patron of HEYWOOD and the Macaenas of the age he lived in The stage however was his most favourite object of protection for he was himself an actor indulged this propensity very early in life MORE was educated in the family of Cardinal MERTON bishop of CANTERBURY whose chaplain MEDWALL wrote moralities which were assisted both by the pen and the acting of MORE we are told that it was his custom to mix with the players when he was not previously expected and let the subject be what it might he made out his part extempore in so entertaining a manner that not only the matter he delivered was the best in the piece but as POLLONIUS says  "he was accounted the best actor"  whom he became the jester and so much the favourite of king HENRY the eighth that he highly rewarded him says  an author for the mirth and quickness of his conceits"  HEYWOOD however was not a sincere adherent of HENRY for he was a bigotted Roman Catholic and therefore in his heart attached himself closely to the interest of MARY to whom when the Protestants were burning in Smithfield he used to relate facetious stories even at the time when she was on her death bed by way of chasing the gloom that naturally hung on her guilty mind for having wickedly sacrificed so many martyrs and thus we see the difference of the reward of a servile and accommodating servant and a noble and honourable one HEYWOOD was carressed by HENRY for laughing at him in his sleeve and treating him with duplicity while MORE whose honour nothing could impeach and whose magnanimity nothing could dismay lost his head in return for his fidelity  After cajoling HENRY crouching to EDWARD and deifying MARY HEYWOOD fancying that the generosity and honesty of sentiment revived by ELIZABETH and the Protestant religion might detect his hypocricy and so procure for him a merited punishment thought it prudent to quit the kingdom He died at MECHLIN in BRABANT about  the year after SHAKESPEAR was born His pieces though they were called plays are all interludes such as they have already defined They here were all of them published in and are six in number besides two others called  Pindar of Wakefield  and  Philotas  which are attributed to him but not believed to be his  HEYWOOD's six plays are  A Play between Johan the Husband Tyb the Wife and sir Johan the Priest  which seems to be taken from one of the Tales of BOCCACE which is ludicrously imiated by LA FONTAINE  A Mery Play between the Pardoner and the Friar the Curate and Neighbour Prat The Play called the Four P's being a new and a very mery Interlude between a Palmer a Pardoner a Poticary and a Pedlar A Play of Genteelness and Nobility A Play of Love A Play of the Weather  These interludes for so they all are manifest the character of the man who wrote them They seem by very subtle reasoning between certain personages to try the public opinion and that under an idea of depicting local and temporary manners of which CHAUCER's  Canterbury Tales  stand for the outline and which ever were and ever will be virtually the same  PALSGRAVE who wrote  Acolastus  was a man of very extensive knowledge He flourished in the reigns of HENRY the seventh and HENRY the eighth He was born in London and there received the first rudiments of learning He was afterwards celebrated at CAMBRIDGE for logic and philosophy but his own country and his own language did not satisfy his thirst after learning he therefore went to FRANCE where he became so admired not only for his general talents but his proficiency in partic  lar in the French tongue which he gave a purity and an elegance to which the natives of FRANCE had till then been a stranger  This is a very singular fact PALSGRAVE was the first that reduced the French language to grammatical rules His works which he published in LONDON called  L'Eclaircissement de la Language Francois  is a very ingenious and sensible work so much so that many ingenious French authors have willingly acknowledged that all the elegance and spirit for which the French tongue is so celebrated and which has made it so universal would never have pervaded their language had they not received a promethean influence from English genius and judgment and this generally applies to what I shall particularly insist relative to plays which certainly would not have come to any perfection so early as they did in FRANCE had not the English authors and particularly SHAKESPEAR given them a merit and a perfection unknown to any nation since GREECE  but when the treaty of marriage was on foot between LOUIS the twelfth and Princess MARY sister to HENRY the eighth PALSGRAVE was pitched upon to teach her the French language LOUIS however died very  soon after his marriage and PALSGRAVE attended MARY to ENGLAND where through her influence he became so useful in teaching French to the English nobility that he obtained good church preferment and was made one of the chaplains in ordinary to HENRY the eighth When PALSGRAVE was born or at what time he died cannot now be traced but the historical fact of the marriage between LOUIS and MARY will shew that he was celebrated so early as and as he d  d not publish his ingenious work in the French tongue till the year he must have run a pretty long career of favour and reputation  HENRY PARKER lord MORLEY was born in the reign of HENRY the seventh He was a voluminous author and is said to have written perfect tragedies and comedies taking the ancients for his model but as dramatic pieces do not seem to have been forward enough for this unless their perfection consisted only of their construction and they were neglected for the trash that like  Gammer Gurlon's Needle  they contained it is more rational to suppose that the pieces of this author were interludes  MORLEY was a firm adherent of HENRY He was one of those barons who signed the memorable  letter to CLEMENT the seventh threatening him with the loss of his supremacy in ENGLAND unless he used every possible dispatch to effect the king's divorce The king did not fail to return this attention for when MORLEY had a dispute with lord DACRE of GILLESTAND for precedence he so backed his pretensions that though we are told MORLEY had not right on his side those pretensions were confirmed by parliament He is said to have lived in honour and esteem to a very advanced age and to have enlightened that time with many works of celebrity  RADCLIFF wrote both moralities and interludes and began about at which time many of the monasteries were destroyed to grow celebrated for interlude which like those of HEYWOOD helped forward that toleration which HENRY had introduced He took the Carmelite's house at HITCHIN in HEREFORDSHIRE and converted a part of it into a theatre where his scholars acted Latin and English comedies that they might acquire confidence in public speaking These pieces by being written upon the model of the ancients seem at least some of them to be nearer to plays than those interludes written by HEYWOOD The piece called  Chaucer's Melebee  is said to have been a perfect comedy Their tendency however being always to  second the king's views in his laudable determination to establish the Protestant religion RADCLIFF was greatly countenanced and encouraged and he in consequence lived respected and died rich  SKELTON who among other interludes wrote  The Negromansir  of which we have already seen an account was laureat both at OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE He was promoted to the rectory of DISS in NORFOLK but having more of the actor in him than the parson and being calculated rather to write plays than sermons he made the pulpit a vehicle for the most pointed ridicule and severe farcasm but this did not satisfy him He wrote a prodigious number of ballads against the hypocricy of the priests and particularly the mendicants and for these irregularities he was suspended by NYKKE bishop of NORWICH a rigid man from exercising the duties of the sacred function  This disgrace however giving him notoriety became only a spur to his frolicksome pegasus for he vented his ridicule more and with greater success than ever Scarcely any of the religious escaped him At length he had cause to repent his temerity for having severely attacked the dignity of WOLSEY that powerful and vindictive minister determined to make him a severe example SKELTON  however got an intimation of his intentions and before the officers of justice who were in pursuit of him had arrived to seize him he took refuge in the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey where he was kindly entertained by Abbot ISLIP with whom he resided till the day of his death which happened in  JOHN BOURCHIER lord BERNERS appears to have been a good author himself and a patron of many of the wits of his time He was descended from THOMAS of WOODSTOCK duke of GLOUCESTER He was Knight of the Garter and Constable of WINDSOR CASTLE under EDWARD the fourth and became popular for quelling an insurrection in CORNWALL and DEVONSHIRE which was headed by MICHAEL JOSEPH a blacksmith in and this recommended him to the favour of HENRY the seventh  He was a captain of the pioneers at the siege of THEROUENNE under HENRY the eighth by whom he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer for life He was also Lieutenant of CALAIS and the MARCHES He was appointed to conduct the Princess MARY into FRANCE on her marriage at which time he became acquainted and wrote in conjunction  with PALSGRAVE and what was very remarkable he enjoyed the confidence and continued in the favour of HENRY eighteen years He wrote himself but one comedy called  Ite in Veneam  but it was principally owing to his patronage that the stage boasted the celebrity it possessed at the time of his death which happened in  From this nobleman by his marriage with CATHERINE the daughter of the duke of NORFOLK is descended the present lady baroness BERNERS whose right to that title had long lain in obscurity till at length it was clearly made out and recovered by PETER NEVE esq NORROY    Of the rest of the interlude writers some of whom also wrote plays there is nothing that can be collected remarkable enough to merit particular attention WAGER WAYER WAPULL UPTON WOODS PEELE and others were writers of this class and their interludes were generally controversies concerning the reformation which it may be easily conceived always tended to some conclusion in its favour  Thus HENRY the eighth who persecuted priests encouraged actors and thus HEYWOOD and SKELTON were cunningly employed to enforce toleration and strip off the mask of hypocrisy from WOLSEY and his dependants This will presently  shew us that plays properly so called by partaking more of rational manners obtained no permanent reputation and decided character till the Protestant religion cleared away those clouds of bigotry and superstition in which pure nature and fair truth had been shrouded and concealed Interludes began the work but it remained for plays to perfect it  CHAP IX PLAYS  IT is generally believed that  Gammer Gurton's Needle  was the first piece possessing the requisites of a play that was performed in this kingdom This however is a very doubtful conjecture unless it be allowed that it was written many years before it came from the hands of bishop STILL who is said to have produced it when he was Master of Arts at CAMBRIDGE A piece called  Dyccon the Bedlam  which was entered at Stationers Hall in seems to have served for the ground work of  Gammer Gurton  and must have been originally written many years before for such incomprehensible nonsense could never have been permitted so long after SKELTON JOHN HEYWOOD MEDWALL lord MORLEY PALSGRAVE and JASPER HEYWOOD produced pieces much better written the last of whom translated three tragedies from SENECA  STILL however though he seemed extremely  fond of preserving as much of the nonsense as possible knew very well the true construction of a perfect play and though the ridiculous story he had to deal with was no more than GAMMER GURTON's loosing the needle with which she was mending her husband's breeches the coil kept up by this terrible accident and the intrigues of DICCON by which they are all set together by the ears while he gets good fare and is rewarded all the way round yet all this is truly dramatic as well as the catastrophe gradually relieving their fears by the recovery of the needle which is found sticking in the breeches to the great annoyance of HODGE who in putting them on feels a painful proof of the fact  As to the play itself I should conceive it to be a burlesque of the Roman dramatists and particularly of PLAUTUS and TERENCE for it has all the balderdash of the first and the regularity of the last It is as indecent as vulgar and licentious as the one and as dull as insipid and stupid as the other in which case taking the drift of it the bishop deserves praise instead of censure for nothing can be more correctly attended to than are the unities and who knows but by this scrupulous care ARISTOTLE and HORACE might not have been marked as the objects of his ridicule as well  as PLAUTUS and TERENCE We at this moment have forgot to relish the admirable humour of the  Rehearsal  even though every man of reading knows something of the crude yet valuable plays of DRYDEN How then shall we be able to judge of the merits of a play at such a distance of time which we acknowledge to be perfect in requisites that some think of an equal value to all the rest  I mean nothing more in this than to reconcile the jarring opinions of different authors some of whom think nothing valuable that is not ancient and others that is not modern It is as ridiculous to value a coin for its rust as it is to overlook that historical intelligence it may happen to convey All extremes are contemptible Prudent reasoners will think thus Great and enlightened writers have started in all ages and in all nations and though literary productions which by the bye are not always works of genius were not multiplied to such a degree or so cut out and constructed by square and rule before printing was invented as they have been since yet it does not at all imply that letters begat poetry but rather that genius begat letters What shall we say to oral tradition which has transmitted from age to age those many sublime and exquisite ideas invented or rather imbibed by poets who could not read which modern writers and those celebrated for erudition have been obliged to adopt We know by this that the measure of invention was full before the regulations of literature were agreed upon At the same time we know that when nature is left to herself her productions however luxuriant are not so beautiful nor so vigorous as when skilfully pruned arranged innoculated and grafted but it must indeed be with skill that this is attempted otherwise destruction would be the consequence instead of preservation and after all it must be remembered that though cultivation may improve nature without the productions of nature there could be no cultivation at all Wise men therefore though they laudably encourage every attempt to polish the beauty and bring out the lustre of poetry will always chuse that simplicity which brings nature home to the heart rather than see it rounded by a period or dressed in an idiom    As to the play in question it is worthy of but very little contention nor is it easy to be accounted for why so much notice should have been taken of it by a variety of authors or how it met with success to the degree which they have asserted unless being in the light of an opposition to the interludes it was considered as an innovation a circumstance always eagerly caught at in the theatrical state  That there were several plays before  Gammer Gurton's Needle  however admits of very little doubt We have an account of a tragedy called  Matilda  which was performed before HENRY the seventh sixty years at least earlier than that comedy The  Andria  of TERENCE a flat insipid piece  Hycke Scorner  which seems to be something like a personification of CHAUCER's  Canterbury Tales  and contains a whimsical and humourous display of the vices and follies of the age interspersed with moral reflections and indeed if it were properly divided and digested would rank well in the lists of the drama  Thyestes Hercules Eurens  and  Troas  translated from SENECA by JASPER HEYWOOD  Jack Jugler  a strange heterogeneous attempt at a comedy  and several others were written before the date which  Gammer Gurton's Needle  bears  The comedy of  Piscator or the Fisher caught  written by HOKER who we are told was a man of fancy and learning a rhetorician and a poet also came much earlier so did lord MORLEY's tragedies and comedies which seem to have been translations from the ancients and indeed many more some of which rank in no determinate class not being regular plays but rather something generally dramatic  At the beginning of the sixteenth century however many plays of various descriptions were performed and among the rest I find from HOLLINGSHED and other authors one of which is RICCOBONI who seems to have picked up good theatrical intelligence that on the seventh of May the king caused a masquerade to be prepared and ordered a stage to be raised in the great hall at GREENWICH and the king the queen and the nobility came there to the representation of a good comedy of PLAUTUS  This might have been one of the foregoing plays for as the English seemed to emulate the Romans in their courage and their various struggles for freedom  so did they in their poetry witness their admiration of MARTIAL in that poets life time and those plays were the greatest part of them translations the comedies from PLAUTUS and TERENCE and the tragedies always from SENECA the pomp of whose style seems in all countries to have captivated the early writers  Yet with all these advantages nothing worthy mentioning except for the purpose of exciting the curiosity of the reader and filling up chronology can be found before SHAKESPEAR As however when I come to that memorable era I shall have facts enough to bear me out without having any further recourse to conjectures it may not be uninteresting to piece out this volume with such circumstances relative to these ancient plays and their writers as may serve not only to corroborate past observation but also to elucidate future enquiry  Sir JAMES LINDSAY who we are told first introduced plays into SCOTLAND is said by several authors to have written tragedies and comedies He was born late in the fifteenth century He was honourably employed at the court of JAMES the fifth of SCOTLAND but his dramatic writings were so sharp and so pointed against the licentiousness  of the court and the corruption of the clergy that he was not only stript of all his emoluments except the place of Lion King at Arms which was conferred on him for life but it is wonderful saysan old author  "that he escaped their bloody hands who were so skilful and had such power at that time to shed the blood of honest men and martyrs"  This author seems to have been an imitator of ARISTOPHANES His humour was cutting and severe as well as droll and ludicrous and his representation of the person held up to ridicule was so like that it was instantly known for some profligate courtier or corrupt priest The abbot of PAISLEY who was successfully ridiculed in this manner complained of him to his patron the earl of ARRON He not being powerful enough to resist the influence of the priest gave up LINDSAY who at length in disgust retired to his paternal estate and sought there that tranquility as a philosopher which had been denied to him in the world as a courtier and a poet  JASPER HEYWOOD who has been already mentioned as the translator of three tragedies from SENECA was son to the famous HEYWOOD the interlude writer JASPER seems to have been as strange a character as his father He studied at  MERTON college where having been guilty of many unpardonable irregularities he resigned his gown to avoid a sentence of expulsion After this he entered into the society of Jesuits at St OMERS There he studied for two years and then found himself so qualified for disputation that he did not cease for seventeen years to promulgate his controversies in SWITZERLAND when for his love of the mother church and his zeal against the heretics he was elevated to the degree of Doctor in Divinity and the Four Vows  Pope GREGORY the thirteenth in sent him at the head of the Jesuits to ENGLAND but his intolerable arrogance and pride in which he affected the imperious consequence of WOLSEY running into luxury and magnificence more than his means could allow soon rendered him obnoxious to the court of ELIZABETH and perhaps it is owing to this that he is reported to have been executed in her reign The fact however is that when some of the Jesuits were condemned and the rest in danger of the law ELIZABETH out of humanity ordered them all to be shipped away and sent out of ENGLAND HEYWOOD went first to ROME and then to NAPLES where he became acquainted with JOHN PITSEUS a zealous and bigoted  catholic who speaks of him in the highest terms of respect and admiration  Of THOMAS SACKVILLE lord DORSET it may not be unentertaining to relate some particulars He is said in conjunction with NORTON of whom I shall presently speak to have written what is called the first English tragedy SACKVILLE was a student of both Universities entered of the Temple and early called to the Bar His deportment was so manly his manners so engaging and his wit so lively that he was soon considered as an acquisition to the state His father brought him into parliament at whose death he took possession of a very splendid inheritance  Soon after this he was knighted and immediately promoted to a peerage by the title of baron BUCKHURST Determined to keep up all the consequence attached to his new dignity he launched into such magnificence and profusion that notwithstanding his immense fortune he very soon suffered material inconvenience but the tide of preferment followed on him so fast that he was quickly enabled to look above his difficulties In the queen sent him ambassador to CHARLES the ninth to congratulate that prince on his marriage with the daughter of  MAXIMILIAN and on other state affairs  As this was just after the massacre of the Haguenots on the feast of St BARTHOLOMEW it is more than probable that those other state affairs were some prudent conditions for the future safety of the Protestants Some have argued the very reverse but this we cannot easily believe of ELIZABETH She had the highest opinion of BUCKHURST as a man of uncommon penetration and steadiness He was generally selected out as a proper peson being a man of profound wisdom to be consulted in all affairs of life and death He was one of those being then in the privy council who sat on the trial of THOMAS HOWARD duke of NORFOLK which lord was executed for being concerned in a plot to recover the liberty of MARY Queen of Scots He was also named one of the commissioners for the trial of that unhappy queen and though he was not present at her condemnation at FOTHFRINGAY CASTLE yet after her sentence was confirmed ELIZABETH made choice of him as a person of the most insinuating address in her court and one should think of the  feeling to reconcile her to her hard fate and to see the decree put in execution  At the court of FRANCE he was received with all the honours due to his own merit and the dignity of his sovereign  It should seem that ELIZABETH made use of BUCKHURST to play off first LEICESTER and afterwards ESSEX for he was sent ambassador to the States General to accommodate some differences that had arisen in consequence of certain conduct in the earl of LEICESTER at which they had thought proper to take umbrage In this commission he  acquitted himself with great honour and rectitude There was something in it however which provoked the resentment of lord BURLEIGH whose influence was at that time so great with the queen hat BUCKHURST was recalled and confined to his house for nine months  This circumstance may serve for a lesson to courtiers who blindly follow the resentment of their employers BUCKHURST gave neither satisfaction to ELIZABETH nor BURLEIGH The queen though she sent him under a colour of justice to rectify these mistakes rather than vindicate the offender did not mean that he should act so as to irritate her favourite and BURLEIGH though he was glad enough to see BUCKHURST employed in order to keep down the influence of LEICESTER grew however jealous of his splendid abilities and therefore prevailed on the queen to connive at injustice rather than give him an opportunity of getting the upper hand  On LEICESTER's death however his interest at court was renewed to such a degree that BURLEIGH who perhaps feared to appear his enemy feigned to become his friend He was made Knight of the Garter sat on the trial of the earl of ARUNDEL and joined BURLEIGH in negociating a peace with SPAIN which produced the renewal of a treaty with the States General which BURLEIGH having fallen sick BUCKHURST had all the honour of concluding and which as it eased the queen of an expence amounting to a hundred and twenty thousand a year a large sum at that time brought him of course into very great savour  In he was at the particular instance of the queen elected Chancellor of the University of OXFORD in express opposition to her favourite the earl of ESSEX and on BURLEIGH's death she constituted him lord high treasurer In the following year he was joined in a commission with sir THOMAS EGERTON and lord ESSEX to negociate with the Senate of DENMARK and when ESSEX libelled the queen as to her conduct concerning IRELAND when the misguided SOUTHAMPTON fuller of friendship and intemperate zeal than prudence and reason joined that unhappy favourite BUCKHURST was appointed lord high steward upon the occasion  JAMES who before his arrival in ENGLAND had heard a great deal of the honest services and splendid abilities of lord BUCKHURST scarcely mounted the throne when he renewed that nobleman's patent of lord high treasurer In the following year he created him earl of DORSET and appointed him one of the commissioners for executing the office of earl MARSHAL which however he did not long enjoy for he died suddenly as he was sitting at the council table at WHITEHALL on the th of April aged seventytwo  As the annals of this country have spoken largely of the character of this nobleman both as a man and a statesman in which capacities he seems to have conducted himself most honourably I shall speak no further of him than as a dramatic author a distinction equally reputable to him and to the theatre for it is a remarkable proof of his good sense in the midst of his great variety of important avocations to consider the stage as an object worthy his attention and it is a high compliment to the stage that it received such early improvement from a man of such splendid abilities  The play of  Gorboduc  written by SACKVILLE in conjunction with NORTON which is said to be the first English tragedy or more properly the first regular English tragedy is taken from history and highly spoken of by several authors out of all which praise however I shall content myself with selecting the words of sir PHILIP SIDNEY  "It is"  says he  "full of stately speeches well sounding phrases climbing to the height of SENECA's style and as full of notable morality which it doth most delightfully teach and so obtain the very end of poetry"  NORTON who is said to have written the three  first acts of  Gorboduc  was after all very likely only the amanuensis of SACKVILLE He was counsel to the Stationer's Company and received the fees for such literary works as were entered on their books and happening to have been a student with SACKVILLE was probably assisted in life by that nobleman His own writings appear to have been not at all dramatic for he was a sort of enthusiast He translated religious pieces from the latin and being a cotemporary of STERNHOLD and HOPKINS and intimate with them he assisted those notable poets in their curious version of the Psalms We are told that NORTON wrote twentyseven of them himself and that his initials are prefixed to them if so the reader may easily be satisfied as to his poetical abilities  THOMAS PRESTON wrote a piece called  Cambyses King of Persia  which would have been but little known had it not been for the notice taken of it and its author by more celebrated men than PRESTON who was according to report a much better actor than a poet He performed so well in a play called  Dido  written by RITWISE before ELIZABETH in when she was entertained at CAMBRIDGE that as a testimony of her approbation  she settled a pension on him of twenty pounds a year  This man is supposed to have been an object of envy to SHAKESPEAR a most strange and improbable conjecture SHAKESPEAR is said to have ridiculed the circumstance of this annuity in his  Midsummer's Night's Dream  and in  Henry the Fourth  to have laughed at PRESTON's play where he makes FALSTAFF talk of  "King CAMBYSES vien"  The latter tour of pleasantry is natural enough but there is nothing of envy in it and as to the annuity as it was conferred in the very year that SHAKESPEAR was born he could neither envy it nor will he be supposed of being such a bungler at his profession or so ungrateful as to ridicule the queen for a benefit she had conferred on another thirty years before when at the very time he is supposed to have written this ridicule she was heaping favours on him    RICHARD EDWARDS who was born in who ran very rapidly through a variety of studies and was early made Master of Arts at OXFORD was one of the gentlemen of queen ELIZABETH's chapel and teacher of music to the children of the choir We are told that he had a patent as manager of a theatre royal in that reign He was certainly very highly in favour with the queen who constantly attended and very much admired his productions of which the pieces known to us are  Damon and Pythias  and  Palamon and Arcyte  both of which subjects are familiar to every reader and shew evidently how much as we have seen before  that CHAUCER and the other old poets have contributed to the celebrity of the theatre  Damon and Pythias  one of the most affecting and beautiful stories of antiquity is considering the time very dramatically treated by EDWARDS but  Palamon and Arcyte  taken avowedly from CHAUCER's  Knight's Tale  was the greatest favourite with the court After the first representation of this piece the queen summoned the poet into her presence and paid him very handsome compliments She remarked that PALAMON was so justly drawn as a lover that he must have been in love indeed That ARCYTE was a right martial knight having a swart and manly countenance yet with the aspect of a VENUS clad in armour that the lovely EMILIA was a virgin of uncorrupted purity and unblemished simplicity and that although she sung so sweetly and gathered flowers alone in the garden she preserved her chastity undeflowered EMILIA was the only female part in the play It was performed by a boy of fourteen years old the son of the dean of Christchurch dressed like a princess and the queen was so charmed with him that she presented him with eight guineas The reputation of EDWARDS was certainly very high during his life which terminated the very year in which he produced with so much success  Palamon and Arcyte    GEORGE PEELE a most excentric character was on one account or another very celebrated early in ELIZABETH's reign He took the degree of Master of Arts at OXFORD and afterwards became in LONDON the city poet and had the ordering of the pageants He is spoken of as a very voluminous dramatic writer and we are told that his works not only succeeded very greatly in his life but that they were read with great pleasure after his death He is said in particular to have been a good pastoral poet Upon the whole however as it is too frequently the case he seems to have derived his reputation more from having been the object of patronage to a nobleman than to the muses for his merry pranks in which he is classed with SCOGGAN SKELTON and DICK TARLETON all  bon vivants  with whom the earl of NORTHUMBERLAND in imitation of ANTHONY with the Roman actors very often condescended to get drunk lifted him into a degree of public opinion which his works do not by any means appear to bear out In short his profligate manners and irregular life but little qualified him for a knowledge of that morality indispensibly necessary in the composition of a real dramatic entertainment and it is therefore though one of his plays has been ignorantly attributed to SHAKESPEAR that the licentious GEORGE PEELE like his imitators ROCHESTER and KILLIGREW is little  known but by his jests  "which"  an author says  "in literature may be compared to the tricks or a sharper in society for they are false specious and imposing"  LILLY was in his time so noted a character for peculiarity is always sure to be notorious that he has an indispensible right to be mentioned here He seems as if he had set out not only with a view to reform the stage but the English language which however he miserably injured by substituting quaintness for simplicity and bombast for wit His aim was to become master of the revels that through the medium of the stage he might promulgate his meditated innovation He missed it however for queen ELIZABETH did not chuse to give him that post but this did not deter him for knowing well the affectation of courts and being a man of consummate perseverence he set himself up as a reformer of the English language under an idea of weeding it of obsolete and uncooth expressions in which task he so well succeeded that it was as unfashionable for a time in the court of ELIZABETH to be ignorant ot LILLY's  Euphuisme  as it was called as it would be now to be ignorant of the French language  We have seen many instances where singularity has been so cherished for excellence that authors have made fortunes when they themselves only expected to excite curiosity and when they actually merited public indignation As to Mr LILLY and his anatomy of wit which he distinguished by the title of  Luphues and his England  he seems successfully to have laughed at the people he pretended to to instruct This stupid and extravagant romance vas a quaint and an affected imitation of oriental poetry which by a substitution of exotic phrases in the place of vernacular expressions deprived the English language of all its simplicity to stuff it with every thing that was unnatural It was like plucking up daisies to plant tuberoses In short he was a shallow writer but a keen penetrator and knew how to make up with art and cunning for the deficiencies of nature and genius An instance or two will shew that however LILLY was ignorant as to blowing the roses of language in June he managed pretty well to preserve a faint resemblance of them at Christmas which is a more extraordinary thing  Speaking of love he says  "There must in every triangle be three lines The first beginneth the second augmenteth the third concludeth it a figure so in love three virtues affection which draweth the heart secrecy which encreaseth the hope constancy which finisheth the work Without any of these rules there can be no triangle without any of these virtues no love"  In another place we find this passage  "Fire cannot be hidden in the flax without smoke nor musk in the bosom without smell nor love in the heart without suspicion"  To examine this madness would be to imitate it It answered the author's purpose for whatever his merits were as to erudition he had read enough to know that affectation would be sure to succeed at court and though we cannot compliment him on having derived his success from his genius we cannot refrain from giving him some degree of praise for conciliating that credulity he successfully laughed at    LILLY wrote nine plays which have all a smack of  Euphuism  and were therefore celebrated for their day for they were all  Ephemerons  He is nevertheless highly extolled by some writers as a paragon of  literature BLOUNT calls him  "the only rare poet of that time"  which observation as some of his plays were started against some of SHAKESPEAR's will no doubt be universally credited  "The witty comical facetiouslyquick and unparalleled JOHN LILLY"  And in another place matter BLOUNT tells us inspired no doubt with beauties of  Euphuism    "that he sate at APOLLO's table that APOLLO gave him a wreath of his own bays without snatching and that the lyre he played on had no borrowed strings"  Thus LILLY who passed that for wit which he knew to be stupidity like a bouncer who at last believes his own lies was flattered by the same quaintness the same base coin he had imposed upon others into a belief of that merit to which truth and nature vainly laboured to convince him he was an utter stranger  ROBERT GREEN would have been considered as an author of merit and held in some esteem had he not in company with GEORGE PEELE and the set already mentioned plunged himself into every species of profligacy and debauchery leaving a good and beautiful wise to lavish her substance on libertines and prostitutes We are told that he is the first English poet who wrote for bread having been obliged whenever his extravagance threw him to distress to have recourse to his pen for subsistence  This induced him most shamefully to prostitute his genius for knowing that those writings would be surest to sell best which were the most obscene he gratified the rakes of that age by every species of licentious poetry till he obtained by these worthy labours a considerable income Penury however disease the indignation of good men and a consciousness of his own infamy led him into a gradual termination of his miserable and profligate life which after all finished as it had began for a voluptuary to the last he died by overeating himself  Some affirm that he died a penitent and instance to prove this assertion his having written a letter full of contrition to his injured wife and also two or three publications of the same complexion The manner of his death however the hypocrify contained in his recantations and above all his total forgetfulness of his wife's distress till he was in the most abject distress himself are pretty plain proofs that his profligacy was innate and impossible to be eradicated and that in proportion as disease impaired the vigour of his mind he covered the principles of a libertine with the meanness of a sycophant and the dissimulation of a hypocrite  GREEN wrote sour plays and was concerned in several others all which evince a mind which had  it been rightly turned would have lent considerable assistance to the cause of literature  Sir PHILIP SIDNEY whose writings public conduct and remarkable fortunes very peculiarly distinguished him demands to be noticed in this place He was born in He was elegantly educated and very early sent on his travels When he was but eighteen he narrowly escaped assassination at PARIS during the massacre of the huguenots at twentytwo he was sent on an embassy to RANDOLPH emperor of GERMANY from which time he took an active and very often a resolute part as a vigilant statesman He opposed the queen's marriage with the duke of ANJOU as it is supposed at the instance of his uncle the earl of LEICESTER The queen however appears not to have been very well pleased for upon some frivolous though violent quarrel which he had with VERE earl of OXFORD he was constrained to retire from court  He was soon however recalled for in he was knighted and immediately bringing his abilities into action he projected an expedition with sir FRANCIS DRAKE against AMERICA but was again restrained by the queen She however made him governor of FLUSHING which had then been just  put into her possession as one of the cautionary towns and general of horse  After this sir PHILIP was permitted to pursue his career unrestrained for in July he surprized AXIL and by his enterprizing and spirited conduct preserved the lives and the honour of the the English army at GRAVELINE From these he aspired to other splendid and valorous atchievements till his same was so great and so universal that he was put in election for the kingdom of POLAND which it is supposed he would have carried but for the interference of the queen who said  "she admired his emulation but could not consent to lose his services"  What could be the radical cause of ELIZABETH's strange conduct in relation to this extraordinary man one moment advancing his fortune the next repelling it is one of those state secrets to which different authors give different motives but are seldom able to come at the truth SIDNEY being the nephew of LEICESTER it is very natural to suppose that he partook of the smiles and frowns with which according to circumstances the queen savoured or threatened the uncle All we certainly know is that her's was a sort of an April kindness and that it was sometimes her custom to lour and  sometimes to shine upon her favourites for though she loudly lamented the death of SIDNEY when covered with glory he gallantly fell in the flower of his age at the battle of ZUTPHEN when she was told sometime after that her favourite ESSEX had atchieved prodigies of valour she blamed him for his forwardness and cried out to BURLEIGH  "why we shall have him knocked on the head like that rash fellow SIDNEY"  The literary works of sir PHILIP SIDNEY are various and are allowed to possess considerable merit His  Arcadia  by which he has been most celebrated ran though eight editions though not published till after his death Some esteem his  Apology for Poetry  as his best performance and his defence of his uncle the earl of LEICESTER has been spoken of as a spirited and sensible production He wrote one dramatic piece called  The Lady of May    Sir PHILIP SIDNEY has been spoken of differently by different authors but this is easily accounted for He was professedly a Maecenas and it is natural that patronage should in great measure beget praise This praise however bestowed on the poet has regularly cooled as the man has been forgotten He is first extolled afterwards praised then  commended and at last abused Of SIDNEY it has been said by a writer near his time  "that he enjoyed and deserved the most exalted praises of his own age and would of future ages That SPENSER reverenced him not only as a patron but as a master That so much sweet nature excellent behaviour welldigested learning rare wit courage breeding and other additional accomplishments of conversation never before met in any one man That he was a statesman a soldier and a scholar but"  says he  "his pen and his sword have rendered him famous enough for he died by the one and by the other he'll live for ever"  This is not an exact mode of biographical celebration nor indeed is it very correct sense but it is panegyric which may take leave so it be warm and glowing to be a little absurd under an idea of shrouding inaccuracy behind the dazzle of admiration  The other author I allude to who I hope as he allows no posthumous fame to others has no expectation of any himself says of sir PHILIP SIDNEY  "that accidents of birth court favour and popularity gild a slender portion of merit He had great valour but it was an age of heroes  We have"  says he  "a tedious lamentable pedantic pastoral romance which the patience of a young virgin in love cannot wade through and some absurd attempts to fetter English verse in Roman chains a proof that this applauded author understood but little the genius of his own language"  After going on for some time in the same strain he finishes with saying that  "he died with the rashness of a volunteer after having lived to write with the  sang froid  of Madmoiselle SCUDERY"  The fact seems to be that like BOLINBROKE HORACE WALPOLE and many other noble authors who by their own admirable abilities and their liberal encouragement of cotemporary writers in need of their protection have left behind them a double claim on the gratitude of posterity sir PHILIP SIDNEY was not only as FALSTAFF says witty himself but the cause of wit in others  The writings of authors of this description are in general more the fruits of their leisure hours and a relief from arduous avocations than a regular employment to which their inclination induce them solely to attend The works of SIDNEY are full of genius beauty and good sense and though they  may not merit so warm a eulogium as that bestowed on him by the first author I have quoted they are considerably above that mediocrity into which they are attempted to be lowered by the last  Many more authors ought to be enumerated who though they produced pieces during the reign of SHAKESPEAR started originally before him Of these however little more can be noticed than that they assisted in preparing the stage for that state of perfection towards which it was then verging but which certainly it would never have attained but for the incomparable and unparalleled talents of our immortal bard It may not be amiss however to remark that some of these were men of no mean abilities  ALEXANDER NEVILL made a very early progress in learning and at sixteen associated with the celebrated JASPER HEYWOOD in translating the tragedies of SENECA In this association NEWTON a very learned writer who was first a schoolmaster and who through the patronage of ROBERT earl of ESSEX became beneficed NUCE who is said rather to have attempted plays in the manner of SENECA than to have translated SENECA himself STUDLY who was a student at CAMBRIDGE and  afterwards killed at the siege of BREDA under the command of prince MAURICE were all members Among this fraternity who worked separately as well as in conjunction almost the whole of SENECA's tragedies were rendered into English and several others invented by which efforts the English stage boasted if not the fancy of GREECE at least the regularity of ROME  Besides these were FULWELL who is spoken of as an ingenious writer and who produced one piece called  Like will to like quothe the Devil to the Collier  LUPTON who wrote a play called  All for Money  INGELAND wrote  The Disobedient Child  NASH who was a companion of GREEN and his disoliate friends and who but for his profligacy might have ranked well as an author for he was remarkable for keen and witty satire KYFFIN who translated one of the comedies of TERENCE and who was tutor to the children of his patron lord BUCKHURST GOLDING who translated many celebrated works with great reputation and several other authors that might be named besides anonymous playwrights out of number whose pieces are entered at Stationer's Hall  Thus out of a very large mass of materials I  have selected such particulars as I considered fully adequate to illustrate all I have advanced relative to the antiquity of the English theatre I shall now first enquire into the merit of the early actors and afterwards recapitulate such circumstances as may be yet necessary to go over in order to give SHAKESPEAR a clear stage on his first appearance  CHAP X ACTORS  TO speak of the antiquity of English acting with a view of shewing what it particularly was would be impossible and even to take it up generally would be to leave it in a very indefinite state We might say with great truth that ALFRED RICHARD COEUR DE LION and many other princes were actors that the monks out of all enumeration were actors and that the kingdom at different times swarmed with actors who were always correctly of the same description even from the time of the Roman conquest to the vagrant act of EDWARD the third  The particular merits of these men however will never be known and some may think it not very material that they should were it possible however to get at them I should lose no diligence in the search for though it is certainly true that the man who merely utters cannot stand the same chance of posthumous  fame as the man who writes yet the obligation Was mutual while the actor lived and I don't see why the poet whose works he set off should neglect to celebrate that merit without which he himself would never have been celebrated What pains have been taken to perpetuate the memory of ROSCIUS Kings poets and philosophers have written and spoken his eulogium To RICHARD's being an actor ENGLAND owed the release of that monarch and to the adroitness of ALFRED in the same capacity sprung the victory over the Danes  The similarity of the progress of acting in ENGLAND and FRANCE has been already noticed In FRANCE we find no actors celebrated by name till we get at TURLUPIN and his companions introduced by the farces of the Children of Sans Souci and here though we find a pretty strong contention between the students at St PAUL's school and the clerks at Clerkenwell yet till the interludes of HEYWOOD in which he himself sir THOMAS MORE and others assisted we learn nothing of the particular merits of an actor  From this time however we begin to get pretty well acquainted with them and find that either for pleasure or profit that knot of  bon vivants  which were headed by GREEN PEELE and NASH were  all actors The most conspicuous in the groupe is TARLETON whose history contains some whimsical particulars He was brought to town from SHROPSHIRE by one of the servants of lord LEICESTER who found him in a field taking care of his father's swine and was so pleased with his answers that he introduced him to the earl who astonished at the quickness of his intellects brought him to court where he became a sort of jester to the queen  We are told that there were times when ELIZABETH preferred TARLETON to all her favourites that the courtiers paid him the greatest homage and often employed him to pave the wayv for their kind reception  "When the queen"  says an author  "was serious I dare not say sullen TARLETON could undumpish her at his pleasure He told her more of her faults than most of her chaplains and cured her of her melancholy better than all her phylicians"  TARLETON was an actor at the Bull in Bishopgatestreet and performed originally in the play of  Henry the Fifth  from which SHAKESPEAR is supposed to have collected the materials for his play under the same title Supposing however this report to be truth it could have furnished him only with a few hints for it had neither FLUELLIN  PISTOL the HOSTESS or any of those excellent characters which we know to have been SHAKESPEAR's invention or rather his imitation from nature  When ELIZABETH at the solicitation of sir FRANCIS WALSINGHAM appointed a dozen players to perform at BARNELMS allowing them wages and liveries as grooms of the chamber TARLETON was made a sort of manager An old author says  "that for the clown's part he never had his equal  Even BEN JOHNSON who libels actors could not refrain from applauding TARLETON Indeed by all accounts his humour was of an irresistable kind I suppose something like that of WESTON for we are told that  "the self same words spoken by another would hardly move a merry man to smile which uttered by him would force a sad soul to laughter  "There are many stories related of TARLETON two of which at least appears to be fabrications Every one knows that RABELAIS when he had not a sous in his pocket contrived to feast sumptuously all the way from PROVINCE to PARIS by wrapping up brickdust in different papers and writing on them  "Poison for the king poison for the queen poison for the dauphin"  by which stratagem he contrived to be conveyed at the expence of the government as a state prisoner A similar story is trumpt up for TARLETON who having run up a large score at an alehouse in SANDWICH made a servant boy accuse him as a seminary priest and so contrived that the officers of justice when they came in search of him found him on his knees crossing himself These vigilant ministers of justice fancying they should make a good thing of this discovery paid his reckoning and conveyed him to London but when he came before FLEETWOOD the recorder who knew him and recognized in this trick one of the well known exploits of TARLETON he not only discharged him but courteously entertained him in return for his wit Another time when he was in a storm and the passengers were ordered to throw their most cumbersome luggage overboard he is said to have requested that he might throw his wife into the sea which possibly might have happened and that is all we can say for it has been a joke for more than two thousand years By the way TARLETON is said to have reason for wishing to be disencumbered of his wife for he was a notorious cuckold nay they go so far as to say that Cuckold's Point was so named by a waterman as he one day landed TARLETON at that place  "  TARLETON for some time kept a tavern in Paternoster Row and afterwards the sign of the Tabor in Grace Church Street where his humour operated as such an attraction that it was common to have his portrait as a sign  In Bishop HALL's Satires we find these words  " To sit with TARLETON on an ale post's sign"  OLDYS says that there was a sign in the Borough of a man playing on the pipe and tabor with the name of TARLETON written under it and that this portrait was a copy of a wooden print which was published at the head of a work called  Tarleton's Jests  LORD OXFORD had a portrait of TARLETON with his tabor and pipe certainly taken from the print in the front of this jest book He is there represented in his Clown's dress playing on his pipe with one hand and beating the drum with the other This print is said to have been so well cut that a flatness appears upon the nose which was occasioned by a wound he got in parting some dogs and bears This misfortune he turned into merriment by noticing that it did not affect him for that he had still sagacity enough to smell a knave from an honest man    He wrote one dramatic piece called  The Seven Deadly Sins  and this appears to have been when tired of his debaucheries he like GREEN and NASH pretended to repent of his irregularities at which time his wit seems to have dwindled into mere scurrility for as he grew debilitated with his excesses he became sour and sarcastic None escaped his virulence not even LEICESTER and RALIEGH till being discarded from court and growing every day more contemptible in the world's opinion he died like VOLTAIRE a mixture of imbecility folly and irresolution  SCOGGAN according to the most probable accounts of him was a wicked wit He had none of the humour of TARLETON the sterling sense of GREEN the satire of NASH nor the barefaced ribaldry of PEELE but he had a cunning that gave him abilities to cope with them all He would attack every man's darling foible and appear to be his master in his own art by which means though always needy he always got praise confidence and a  good bellyful If TARLETON laughed at his paucity of wit he laughed at TARLETON by making him a cuckold if GREEN reproached him with his poverty he took revenge by helping GREEN off with his money if NASH provoked him by his satire he warded off the shaft by callous indifference and if PEELE made him useful in the city pageants he not only feasted well at his expence but he snacked the fees and pawned the ornaments Thus his acting was more serviceable to him off than on the stage where his abilities are said to have been but mediocre With the assistance however of thus playing upon his companions and now and then on their common patron the earl of NORTHUMBERLAND SCOGGAN topic care though he got into all their scrapes to keep himself clear of the consequences of them  Concerning some of the other performers of that time I have already spoken PRESTON was very celebrated so was SKELTON and so were many of the company that performed under the direction of EDWARDS  The young scholars bred up under EDWARDS are very warmly celebrated as excellent actors In the play of  Palamon and Arcyte  I have already noticed the youth who performed the part of the Princess and that he was son to the Dean of Christ Church which will shew that acting at that time was by no means thought disgraceful but we shall see that not only acting considered as a picture of human manners but that mimickry was then performed to admiration for we are told that in the play in question a cry of hounds was so perfectly acted that the queen and all the court could not credit but that it was real  Indeed as to their particular merit  it is extremely difficult to arrive at any critical knowledge of them The specimen I have given of TARLETON's celebrity will however prove that the profession of an actor was completely known at that time for nothing can depict the true merit of comic acting better than the testimony of the different poets and critics who have particularly spoken of their admiration of his talents a very small part of which admiration I have quoted  This account however will serve to shew that actors were at that early period very profligate characters that they debauched the morals of young noblemen and inexperienced youths of every description and that whatever morality they might disseminate by their precepts they cut it up by the roots by their example This occasioned those decrees of ELIZABETH which were so often alternately enforced and broken and established a necessity for the most vigilant attention on the part of the state lest what was intended to improve and polish public manners should corrupt and disgrace  them As dramatic amusements gained strength on the side of genius truth and morality the profession of an actor became more respectable till at length during the epoch to which we are hastening the theatre was so firmly established that it was never shaken again till the troubles in the reign of the first CHARLES  CHAP XI A SUMMARY RECAPITULATION FROM THE DRUIDS TO SHAKESPEAR  UPON a review of what I have hitherto written on the English theatre though many may think the subject unimportant before the birth of SHAKESPEAR yet I cannot repent of having explored a field full of circumstances material to the elucidation of a popular theme even at the risk of being censured by cavillers for exciting rather than gratifying curiosity for though the intelligence I have been able to offer is too often shrouded with doubt and obscurity a misfortune by the bye constantly attendant on every review of lives and actions yet if it produce no other literary benefit the national incidents that are naturally interwoven with dramatic narrative must inevitably give it some interest and though it is not to be expected that rational men should value this or any other theme merely for its antiquity yet the more rational the  man the more he will be induced to allow that the sanction of ages will confirm and establish the importance of every thing avowedly and meritoriously constituted for the instruction and delight of the world and the medium and criterion for the regulation of its manners  If all I have collected of the bards with the Druids at their head and have thereby shewn that every thing lyric is in its essence dramatic is important I have gained my end It were in vain to argue that it is not to be credited because it is conjectural Conjecture from deduction swells into reason and reason upon such ground grows into truth If therefore the Druids existed if the Welch bards existed if OSSIAN led on the Scotch bards or imitated what in his infancy he had imbibed from oral tradition or even if he had never written but on the contrary if all that is attributed to him was gathered from Scotch elders and nurses who though perfect in the beauties of that poetry they sung the oldest of them had not the remotest clue to its origin yet the whole is a mass of such fair probability that no sophistry can shake it and therefore the task if novel is worthy curiosity if probable is entitled to attention and if interesting will be considered as meritorious  If the Mimes of the Romans came over with JULIUS CAESAR and that they did I do not see the smallest reason to doubt ENGLAND must decidedly have then known the dramatic art or else PACUVIUS ACCIUS and LIVIUS ANDRONICUS were ignorant of it BOADICEA tells us it did nay indeed so does MARTIAL so that we have both English and Roman authority for it  After the Romans the chain is so regular from ARTHUR to ALFRED and so on through the dominion of the Saxons that in the celebration of great actions carousals tournaments and other feasts we clearly lead the provincial poets the drift of all whose writings was dramatic These the rulers and principal personages of the land took a delight in encouraging Public rites exercises and amusements all received the sanction and countenance of the great and were considered of so much advantage to manners that the priests were content as in all other countries to imitate the stage in order to enforce the doctrines of the pulpit  Had the priests never taken the matter up and they certainly did take it up from St AUSTIN forwards the stage most probably would never have been known at all in ENGLAND till SHAKESPEAR  for however the vivacity and perpetual curiosity of the French might induce them to search for every possible minute circumstance to give pompous accounts of an amusement in their country in which they have so greatly delighted the more indolent and incurious spirit of English writers who are pleated more to perform than to celebrate have I see not why certainly passed it by as a matter of little moment and thereby lost to posterity what made up and if the remnants of antiquity which have been saved from the general wreck may stand as a proof meritoriously made up the rational delight of our ancestors  But the grand objection will be that however I may speak of dramatic entertainments nothing ought to be considered in that light but tragedy and comedy In this enthusiasm in favour of a distinction which originally was very indefinite the one being in GREECE  The Song of the Goat  and the other  The Song of the Village  one therefore implying a particular event and the other a general amusement we set up a distinction of our own and we define tragedy to be a dramatic poem in which some signal action of illustrious persons is represented ending in general fatally  This definition has set the poets together by the ears upon the most natural ground in the world because a term established from a principle totally different has through their filtration of its sense obtained another meaning Those who originally invented tragedy in which was intended nothing more than a hymn in honour of BACCHUS little dreamt that this word would be used to signify the great and warlike actions of heroes and legislators and that this commemorating the death of a goat should afterward record the death of emperors ARISTOTLE very gravely and with the consent of his partizans tells us that  "tragedy is the imitation of one grave and entire action of a just length"  an observation that could belong to nobody but ARISTOTLE  "which without the assistance of narration by raising of terror and compassion refines and purges our passions"  Now it is scarcely possible to insist on worse nonsense than this My author says very gravely that this definition has thrown the critics into great perplexity and no great wonder for  "the just length the existence of a tragedy without narration"  a a thing which is actually narration in action and  "the terror and compassion which ought alone to be excited by tragedy"  is a crust for the critics which ARISTOTLE alone knew how to digest Many opinions have been upon this subject rendered inexplicable by pedantry and even CORNEILLI whose mind was rather firm jnd whose opinion was pretty decided modesty urges  "that he cannot reconcile ARISTOTLE with himself for that his reasons defeat his definition"  Nay he even denies the purging of our passions to be the end of tragedy As to the general sense of every definition of comedy it is extremely different to torture it into any thing but its vernacular meaning but with all this self evident truth staring him in the face poor ARISTOTLE chuses to cavil here for he will not allow any thing to be comedy but an exposition of the worst and lowest kind of men by way of ridicule What then becomes of all that successful humour by which characters in high life have been laughed at and exposes Those who should be our imitation and who degenerate being surely the most eligible food for fair criticism what becomes of WYCHERLY GAY FARQUAR VANBURGH and CIBBER and what becomes of that very CONGREVE who writes a libel against himself by supporting ARISTOTLE in this strange and inconsistent assertion    which is much nearer the matter a representation of actions in private life generally holding up the follies  of our neighbours to ridicule to deter the spectators from imitating absurdities which these pieces expose Therefore we have not invented what was unknown to the ancients but have merely improved upon their inventions and in consequence we have not to brag of having rejected their art and established one of our own but that as the world has become more polished we have availed ourselves of an art belonging to them which we might probably ourselves have otherwise been ignorant of  Under this idea we are obliged to admit the antiquity of the drama or reject it altogether Every thing improves as human intelligence grows and expands This however does not alter the original principle The original principle of the drama was to represent manners in action and as far as this point was effected it ever existed and never altered nor degenerated but in obedience to times and circumstances  Let us not therefore because dramatic pieces were not written in some peculiar style or manner  because they were not divided into acts because they were not meted by the same measure nor poised by the same weight deny that there is any distinction in the spirit of them anciently and now AESCUYLUS knew what they ought to be and he knew it in full as great perfection as ARISTOTLE because ARISTOTLE stole all his knowledge from AESCHYLUS and his cotemporaries and if AESCHYLUS who imitated HOMER was possessed of this knowledge it is folly and ignorance to deny that the dramatic art was known at any period in which men of erudition existed  It is upon this principle I insist that the dramatic art existed or was known in this country as early as the Druids for the Druids studied the Greeks and who among the Greeks ranked so forward as the dramatic poets  Thus far have I argued in favour of the dramatic art on the score of its antiquity it must be remembered I have not argued on the score of its perfection but if I had it would not have detracted from the value of my reasoning for since SHAKESPEAR we have seen the stage degenerate most miserably and if I were inclined to instance periods when the theatre within the last century deserved no more to be considered in a state of perfection  that it did several centuries past my observations might be thought invidious but they could not be easily attached Nay were I put to it I might avail myself of arguing that a degenerate fall from the pinnacle on which SHAKESPEAR and his cotemporaries placed it in is more degrading than the imperfect state in which it is supposed to have been sunk before it had the advantage of so great and so shining an example  If none of these arguments will exculpate me from the heavy charge of venturing historical circumstances which though highly probable I cannot positively prove let me in common with all historians and biographers claim the privilege of availing myself of every thing positive and collateral that could possibly make out my reasoning of joining admitted facts with rational conjecture of corroborating what we believe with what we know and of gaining credit for having established some little authenticity on a vague and uncertain though by no means an unimportant subject by the assiduous and industrious care with which it has been explored  Over and above this let the collaterally historical facts which have sprung from the subject like agreeable objects that cheat the way on a rugged road  afford some amusement in relief of that jolting which I have given the reader's imagination I did not profess to go on a turnpike road There are no mile stones the way is not measured it is computed and if there were ever any direction posts they have been long ago broken down and destroyed It was nevertheless a road and we have come safely through it and the few vestiges that prove it was formerly frequented though there may not be much beauty and symmetry in them have nevertheless an interesting and a picturesque effect An effect like the productions of CLAUDE whose ruins seem to assume a venerable complacency communicated by the richness of the setting sun that soberly glows behind them  By way of companion to this picture let us turn our eyes to a grey morn full of aerial effect and giving a cheering promise that the same sun which set so serenely solemn the evening before shall again display its comforting influence till by a gradual and invigorating encrease of power and radiance it at length gather into a burst of the most dazzling splendour  In this idea we shall have a fair resemblance of the theatre from the time of HEYWOOD and the interludes The mysteries and the moralities having  gradually declined and at length sunk into oblivion manners in action began to exhibit a dawn of that day in which the objects of nature were at first faintly discerned afterwards more perfectly seen and at last acknowledged in all their charms through the resplendant genius of SHAKESPEAR  The chaos into which the dramatic art was then crumbled began to ferment and distend itself BUCKHURST assisted the process so with the help of SENECA did NASH NEVILLE NEWTON STUDLY NUCE and the rest who seem to have been to JASPER HEYWOOD something like what CHAPLAINE and his worthy companions were to RICHELIEU the translators of TERENCE made the atoms dance a little more EDWARDS by the help of CHAUCER and BOCCACE began to arrange them PEELE drilled them as well as he could but he gave them too volatile a motion LILLY led them forward in a kind of minuet but mistook distortion for grace PRESTON put them into stilts NORTON made them sing psalms LINDSEY held up a mirror to shew them their deformity SIDNEY made them courtly and others did what they could to move the monstrous heap seperate it and mould it into form  Sir PHILIP SIDNEY says speaking of the stage in his time  "Our tragedies and comedies observe rules neither of honest civility or skilful poetry Here you shall have ASIA of the one side and AFRICA of the other and so many other under kingdoms that the player when he comes in must begin with telling where he is or else the tale will not be conceived Now you shall have three ladies walk to gather flowers and then we must believe the stage to be a garden By and by we hear news of a shipwreck in the same place then we are to blame if we accept it not for a rock Upon the back of that comes out a hideous monster with fire and smoke and then the miserable beholders are bound to take it for a cave while in the mean time two armies flie in represented with four swords and bucklers and then what hard heart will not receive it for a pitched held Now of time they are much more liberal For ordinarily it is that two young princes fall in love after many traverses the lady is got with child delivered of a fair boy he is lost groweth a man falleth in love and is ready to get another child and all this in two hours space which how absurd it is in sense even sense may imagine"    Still however the work was very imperfect The rugged and mishapened fragments as they took all manner of monstrous and distorted forms ran about in all directions exhibiting every appearance but nature By continual and steady perseverance however the artificers that had the work in hand began to mould it into better fashion till at length to keep up the allusion Envy like the Devil began to be jealous of this dramatic approach towards order for we find a book dedicated to sir PHILIP SIDNEY by STEPHEN GOSSON called  The School of Abuse a pleasant invective against Poets Pipers Players Jesters and such like Catterpillars of the  Commonwealth  and another called  Plays confuted in five Actions  This book which is dedicated to sir FRANCIS WALSINGHAM labours very hard to prove that plays are calculated to promote licentiousness and immorality and therefore ought not to be suffered in a commonwealth  These publications begat a long controversy which was very warmly taken up against GOSSON by LODGE and THOMAS HEYWHOD which last we shall hereafter see according to his own report indeed wrote or had a hand or at least a main finger his own expression in two hundred plays At the time however of his entering the lists with GOSSON he was very young and it served to help him forward in much the same manner though the circumstances are not alike as the dispute with MOLIERE which brought BOURSAULT into notice GOSSON was attacked very successfully The dispute however did general service for as there was much to expose in the conduct of the stage and its adherents so the appeal to sir FRANCIS WALSINGHAM and sir PHILIP SIDNEY so far called forth their interference that they examined the abuses and occasioned them in material points to be rectified  Thus the labourers in this meritorious work  went on in the most strenuous and animated manner and wrought the better for being watched If a poet thought he had made a perfect form in a play a biting and severe satire convinced him or at least the world that it was monstrous and unnatural However he might fancy that his ideas were sublime and his verses flowing and easy some critic was sure to possess the world with an opinion that his subject was the bathos that his style halted and that his measure limped  These were however good symptoms The warmer the sunshine the more the flies are engendered Crouds of authors begat crouds of critics Those therefore who had written crudely began now to try at writing elegantly The great difficulty was to shape invention which many of them had into regularity To do this they called in the assistance as we have seen of SENECA and TERENCE for however in a much earlier period the genius of the Greeks might have pervaded the English taste we see no visible traces of it at this particular time nor is there any solecism in this The priests knew the Greek poets and most carefully chose them for their models but this continued no longer than during the continuation of the mysteries for at the moment the English authors improved in one hand into plays they on the other hand mistook the  road as to construction and style and therefore followed the uninteresting and phlegmatic Romans instead of imitating the great and original Greeks  In this labyrinth were the poets of that time bewildered or rather to keep on with my first figure in this chaos were they overwhelmed and enthralled Some fancied that the inflated SENECA would open to them all the arcana of tragedy and others than in the tame TERENCE consisted all the merit of comedy Under this influence they forgot the language in which they wrote the manners of their countrymen and the particular style in which to appeal to their passions and their hearts  Thus the unwieldy mass they had to move to concoct to form to animate was too mighty a task for their exertions It remained that the literary glory of GREECE should be born anew in the bard of ENGLAND It remained for a genius great powerful and commanding with the majesty of HOMER the judgment of AESCHYLUS the sweetness of SOPHOCLES the philosophy of EURIPIDES the wit of ARISTOPHANES and the truth of MENANDER to reconcile so many jarring opinions and to perfect this chaos into a world  SHAKESPEAR was this genius and so well by  him were these jarring interests reconciled that all the poets with the assistance of all the critics cannot up to that time nor perhaps since except in his own works find any tragedy and comedy that appeals so forcibly to the heart so perfectly satisfies the mind or indeed that so completely triumphs over all candid objection as  Othello  and  The Merry Wives of Windsor    The genius of SHAKESPEAR then was the power that formed this chaos into a world SHAKESPEAR who for his perfecting the dramatic art deserves the ineffable reverence of ages and who for giving light to the theatrical world might snatch the epitaph from the tomb of NEWTON  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
