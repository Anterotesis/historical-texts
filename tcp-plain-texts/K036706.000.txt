 THE CURE OF SAUL A SACRED ODE Written by DR BROWN  LONDON Printed for L DAVIS and C REYMERS agains  Gray'sInn Holbourn  Printers to the ROYAL  MDCCXXIII  THE ARGUMENT  SAUL  for his Disobedience to Heaven is afflicted with the Fiend of  MELANCHOLY p DAVID  is sent for to cure him by the Power of Music  p  He comes attended with a Choir of Shepherds and as the means of dispelling  SAUL'S  Despair he sings the Creation of the World and the happy Estate of our first Parents in Paradise  p to SAUL  is moved by the Representation but expostulates with  DAVID  "why when others are happy He should be miserable"  p DAVID  to convince him that Guilt is the Source of Misery sings the Fall of Man and his Expulsion from Paradise  p  This alarms the Monarch's Pride and instead of reclaiming provokes him to Resentment and Rage  p DAVID  superior to his Threats awakens his Conscience and terrifies him by singing the Fate and Punishment of Guilt in the Destruction of the rebellious Tribe of  CHORAH  by an Earthquake and of the guilty World by the general Deluge  p SAUL  struck with Horror attempts to kill himself  p  But being prevented by his Friends  DAVID  sooths his Anguish by invoking Repentance and divine Mercy to compose his Passions  p SAUL  relents into virtuous Sorrow  p  But his Despair returning  DAVID  calls on his attendant Choir to raise a more sublime and affecting Strain  p  This hath its Effect and  SAUL  melts into Tears of Penitence  ib DAVID  now comforts him with the Return of the divine Favour  p  To banish the Remains of Pride he then sings his own Happiness in the humble Station of a Shepherd  ib  Still farther to compose the Monarch's Griefs by a Strain of soft Music he throws him into a gentle Slumber invoking celestial Visions to transport him to the Regions of the Blessed and change his Anguish into Joy  p  The desired Effects appear in his Countenance The Fiend departs And  SAUL  awakes in perfect Tranquillity  p DAVID  then concludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony and the seraphic Hymn that attended her as the Minister of Heaven on the Creation of the World  p  THE CURE OF SAUL A SACRED ODE  "VENGEANCE arise from thy infernal Bed  "And pour thy Tempest on his Guilty Head"  Thus Heav'n's Decree in Thunder's Sound  Shook the dark Abyss profound  The unchain'd Furies come  Pale  Melancholy  stalks from Hell  Th' abortive Offspring of her Womb  Despair  and  Anguish  round her yell  By sleepless Terror SAUL possess'd  Deep feels the Fiend within his tortur'd Breast  Midnight Spectres round him howl  Before his Eyes  In Troops they rise  And Seas of Horror overwhelm his Soul  Haste to JESSE'S  Son  repair  He best can sweep the Lyre  Wake the solemn sounding Air  And lead the vocal Choir  On ev'ry String softbreathing Raptures dwell  To sooth the Throbbings of the troubled Breast  Whose magic Voice can bid the Tides of Passion swell  Or lull the raging Storm to Rest  Sunk on his Couch and loathing Day  The heav'nforsaken  Monarch  lay  To the sad Couch the  Shepherd  now drew near  And while th' obedient  Choir  stood round  Prepar'd to catch the Soul commanding Sound  He drop'd a gen'rous Tear  Thy pitying Aid O GOD impart  For lo thy poison'd Arrows drink his Heart  The mighty Song from  Chaos  rose  Aro  nd his Throne the formless Atoms sleep  And drowzy Darkness broods upon the Deep  Confusion  wake  I▪d the Realms of  Chaos  shake  Rouse him from  is dread Repose  Hark loud  Discord  breaks her Chain  The hostile Atoms clash with deafning Roar  Her hoarse Voice thunders through the drear Domain  And kindles ev'ry Element to War  "Tumult cease  "Sink to Peace  "Let there be Light"Th'  Almighty  said  And lo the radiant  Sun  Flaming from his orient Bed  His endless Course begun  See the twinkling  Pleiads  rise  Thy Star  Orion  reddens in the Skies  While slow around the northern Plain  Arcturus  wheels his nightly Wane  Thy Glories too refulgent  Moon  he sung  Thy mystic Mazes and thy changeful Ray  O fairest of the starry Throng  Thy solemn Orb of Light  Guides the triumphant Carr of Night  O'er Silver Clouds and sheds a softer Day  Ye  Planets  and each circling  Constellation  In Songs harmonious tell your Generation  Oh while yon radiant  Seraph  turns the Spheres  And on the stedfast PoleStar stands sublime  Wheel your Rounds  To heav'nly Sounds  And sooth his Songinchanted Ears  With your celestial Chime  In dumb Surprize the list'ning Monarch lay  His Woe suspended by sweet Music's Sway  And awestruck with uplifted Eye  Mus'd on the newborn Wonders of the Sky  Lead the soothing Verse along  He feels he feels the Pow'r of Song  Ocean hastens to his Bed  The lab'ring Mountain rears his rockencumber'd Head  Down his steep and shaggy Side  The Torrent rolls his thund'ring Tide  Then smooth and clear along the fertile Plain  Winds his majestic Waters to the distant Main  Flocks and Herds the Hills adorn  The Lark highsoaring hails the Morn  And while along yon crimsonclouded Steep  The slow Sun steals into the golden Deep  Hark the solemn Nightingale  Warbles to the woodland Dale  See descending Angels show'r  Heav'n's own Bliss on  Eden's  Bow'r  Peace on Nature's Lap reposes  Pleasure strews her guiltless Roses  Joys divine in Circles move  Link'd with Innocence and Love  Hail happy Love with Innocence combin'd  All hail ye sinless Parents of Mankind  They paus'dthe Monarch prostrate on his Bed  Submissive bow'd his Head  Ador'd the Works of boundless Pow'r divine  Then Anguishstruck he cry'd and smote his Breast▪  Why why is Peace the welcome Guest  Of ev'ry Heart but Mine  Now let the solemn Numbers flow  Till he feel that Guilt is Woe  Heav'nly Harp in mournful Strain  O'er yon weeping Bow'r complain  What Sounds of bitter Pangs I hear  What Lamentations wound mine Ear  In vain devoted Pair these Tears ye shed  Peace with Innocence is fled  The Messengers of Grace depart  Death glares and shakes the dreadful Dart  Ah whither fly ye by yourselves abhor'd  To shun that frowning Cherub's firey Sword  Lo  Hapless hapless Pair  Goaded by Despair  Forlorn thro' desert Climes they go  Wake my Lyre can Pity sleep  When Heav'n is mov'd and Angels weep  Flow ye melting Numbers flow  Till he feel that Guilt is Woe  The King with Pride and Shame and Anguish torn  Shot Fury from his Eyes and Scorn  The glowing Youth  Bold in Truth  So still should Virtue guilty Pow'r engage  With Brow undaunted met his Rage  See his Cheek kindles into generous Fire  Stern he bends him o'er his Lyre  And while the Doom of Guilt he sings  Shakes Horror from the tortur'd Strings  What Sounds of Terror and Distress  Rend yon howling Wilderness  The dreadful Thunders sound  The forked Lightnings flash along the Ground  Why yawns that deep'ning Gulph below  'Tis for Heav'n's rebellious Foe  Fly ye Sons of ISRAEL fly  Who dwells in  Korah's  guilty Tents must die  They sinkHave Mercy LordTheir Cries  In dreadful Tumult rise  Hark from the Deep their loud Laments I hear  They lessen now and lessen on the Ear  Now Destruction's Strise is o'er  The countless Host  For ever lost  The Gulph is clos'dTheir Cries are heard no more  But Oh my Lyre what Accents can relate  Sinful Man's appointed Fate  He comes he comes th' avenging GOD  Clouds and Darkness round him rowl  Tremble Earth Ye Mountains nod  He bows the Skies and shakes the Pole  The gloomy Banners of his Wrath unfurl'd  He calls the Floods to drown a guilty World  "Ruin  lift thy baleful Head  "Rouze the guilty World from Sleep  "Lead up thy Billows from their cavern'd Bed  "And burst the Rocks that chain thee in the Deep  Now th'impetuous Torrents rise  The hoarseascending Deluge roars  Down rush the Cataracts from the Skies  The swelling Waves o'erwhelm the Shores  Just O God is thy Decree  Shall guilty Man contend with Thee  Lo  Hate  and  Envy  seaintomb'd  And  Rage  with  Lust  in Ruin sleep  And scoffing  Luxury  is doom'd  To glut the vast and rav'nous Deep  In vain from  Fate  th' astonish'd Remnant flies  "Shrink ye Rocks Ye Oceans rise"  The tottering Cliffs no more the Floods controul  Sea following Sea ingulphs the Ball  O'er the sunk Hills the watry Mountains rowl  And wide  Destruction  swallows all  Now fiercer let th'impassion'd Numbers glow  Swell the Song ye mighty Choir  Wing your dreadful Darts with Fire  Hear me MonarchGuilt is Woe  Thus while the frowning  Shepherd  pour'd along  The deep impetuous Torrent of his Song  SAUL stung by dire Despair  Gnash'd his Teeth and tore his Hair  From his Blood by Horror chill'd  A cold and agonizing Sweat distill'd  Then foaming with unutterable Smart  He aim'd a Dagger at his Heart  His watchful Train prevent the Blow  And call each lenient Balm to sooth his frantic Woe  But pleas'd the  Shepherd  now beheld  His Pride by Heav'n's own Terrors quell'd  Then bade his potent Lyre controul  The mighty Storm that rent his Soul  Cease your Cares the Body's Pain  A sweet Relief may find  But Gums and lenient Balms are vain  To heal the wounded Mind  Come fair  Repentance  from the Skies  O sainted Maid with upcast Eyes  Descend in thy celestial Shrowd  Vested in a weeping Cloud  Holy Guide descend and bring  Mercy  from th' eternal King  To his Soul your Beams impart  And whisper Comfort to his Heart  They come O King thine Ear incline  Listen to their Voice divine  Their Voice shall every Pang compose  To gentle Sorrow sooth thy Woes  Till each pure Wish to Heav'n shall soar  And Peace return to part no more  Behold obedient to their great Command  The lifted Dagger quits his trembling Hand  Smooth'd is his Brow where sullen Care  And furrow'd Horror couch'd with fell Despair  No more his Eyes with Fury glow  But heav'nly Grief succeeds to hellborn Woe  See the Signs of Grace appear  See the soft relenting Tear  Trickling at sweet Mercy's Call  Catch it Angels ere it fall  And let the heartsent Offering rise  Heav'n's bestaccepted Sacrifice  Yet yet againAh see the Pang returns  Again with inward Fire his heaving Bosom burns  Now  Shepherds  wake a mightier Strain  Search the deep heart rending Pain  Till the large Floods of Sorrow roll  And quench the Tortures of his Soul  Almighty LORD accept his Pang sincere  Let heav'nly Hope dispell each dark Temptation  And while he pours the penitential Tear  O visit him with thy Salvation  Stoop from Heav'n ye raptur'd Throng  Sink ye swelling Tides of Song  For lo dissolv'd by Music's melting Pow'r  Celestial Sorrow rolls her plenteous Show'r  O'er his wan Cheek the Colours rise  And Beams of Comfort brighten in his Eyes  Happy King thy Woes are o'er  Thy God shall wound thy Soul no more  The pitying Father of Mankind  Meets the purereturning Mind  Now lowly let the rustic Measure glide  To quell the dark Remains of selfconsuming Pride  Till Nature's homesprung Blessings he confess  And own that calm Content is Happiness  Ye Woods and Lakes ye Cliffs and Mountains  Haunted Grots and living Fountains  Listen to your  Shepherd's  Lay  Whose artless Carols close the Day  Bounding Kids around him throng  The steep Rock echoes back his Song  While all unseen to mortal Eye  Sliding

dwell beneath his PalmTree Shade  Hail meek Angel awful Guest  Still pour thy Radiance o'er my Breast  Pride  and  Hate  in Courts may shine  The  Shepherd's  calm and blameless Tent is Thine  Softly

Heav'n's eternal Gate  Ye who nightly Vigils keep  And rule the silent Realms of Sleep  Exalt the Just to Joys refin'd  And plunge in Woe the guilty Mind  DescendOh wast him to the Skies  And open all Heav'n's Glories to his Eyes  Beyond yon starry Roof by  Seraphs  trod  Where Light's unclouded Fountains blaze  Where Choirs immortal hymn their GOD  Intranc'd in Ecstasy of ceaseless Praise  Angels heal his Anguish  Your Harps and Voices joyn  His Grief to Bliss shall languish  When sooth'd by Sounds divine  Behold with dawning Joy each Feature glows  See the blissful Tear o'erflows  The Fiend is fledLet  Music's  Rapture rise  Now  Harmony  thy ev'ry Nerve employ  Shake the Dome and pierce the Skies  Wake him wake him into Joy  What Pow'r can ev'ry Passion's Throe controul  What Pow'r can boast the Charm divine  To still the Tempest of the Soul  Celestial  Harmony  that mighty Charm is Thine  She heav'nlyborn came down to visit Earth  When from GOD'S eternal Throne  The Beam of allcreative  Wisdom  shone  And spake fair Order into Birth  At  Wisdom's  Call she robed yon glittering Skies  Attun'd the Spheres and taught consenting Orbs to rise  Angels wrapt in Wonder stood  And saw that All was Fair and All was Good  'Twas then ye Sons of GOD in bright Array  Ye shouted o'er Creation's Day  Then kindling into Joy  The Morning Stars together sung  And thro' the vast etherial Sky  Seraphic Hymns and loud Hosannahs rung  THE END
