 THE SCHOOL FOR RAKES A COMEDY  As it is Performed at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET and P A DE HONDT in the Strand MDCCLXIX  Price ONE SHILLING and SIX PENCE  TO DAVID GARRICK  Esq  DEDICATIONS are generally meant to to do honour to the Patron by revealing their private virtues or recording their public merits But neither of these subjects occasioned the present address for while the undivided applause of a nation proclaims the latter my small plaudit must be lost in the general voice and while the friendship and esteem of so many of the first personages of the age are at once the strongest testimony and most pleasing reward of the former my simple concurrence must be deemed superfluous  To neither of these motives then is to be attributed my publicly placing this play under  your patronage but to a desire of acknowledging my gratitude for the great trouble you have taken with it and of indulging a much higher vanity than that of being its author by declaring to the world that you are my friend and that I am  Sir  Your much obliged and most humble servant The AUTHOR  ADVERTISEMENT  THE hint of this comedy was taken from a much admired performance of Monsieur  Beaumarchais  stiled  Eugenie  which Mr Garrick was so kind to put into my hands some time ago I was immediately struck with the elegant simplicity of language and sentiment which characterizes that work and which indeed should do the same in all dramatic writings where neither the persons or situations of the drama are elevated above the common degrees of life  I immediately adopted the plan and set about adapting it to the English Stage But as I proceeded in this work I found I had great difficulties to encounter for though Mons  Beaumarchais  had laid the scene of his play in England he had unluckily adopted Spanish manners This circumstance appeared an unsurmountable obslacle to me and I should have immediately relinquished all hopes from my project if Mr Garrick had not in the most friendly manner lent me his assistance to overcome this otherwise insuperable difficulty  How far I have succeeded in rendering this piece worthy of the English stage must be left to the candor of the public I shall only add that the characters of  Frampton Willis Loyd  I may add Mrs  Winifred  also are of English growth The character of Lord  Eustace  too has receiv'd some additions and I hope that his compunction for the crime he had committed will render him more worthy the favour of a British audience whose generous natures cannot brook the representation of any vice upon the stage except in order to have it punished or reclaimed As the situation of  Harriet  would not admit of any change I have not attempted to deviate from the gentle and interesting  Eugenie  of Monsieur  Beaumarchais  I had written thus far before I could have been informed of the very kind and favourable reception with  which the public have honoured this piece and I think myself extremely happy at having this opportunity of assuring them that I shall ever retain the most grateful sense of their indulgence to me  I am particularly bound to Mrs Clive on this occasion who undertook the study of a new part at a time when she had determined to quit the stage and whose kindness to the author and attention to the public made her hazard her health by performing itI need not say how wellwhen her physicians would have confined her to her chamber  I acknowledge myself also much obliged to the rest of the performers in my play for having acquitted themselves so much to the advantage of the piece and the approbation of the public to whom I have the honour to be  A much obliged and Most obedient Servant The AUTHOR  PROLOGUE Written by a FRIEND  Spoken by Mr KING  THE scribbling gentry ever frank and free  To sweep the stage with prologues fix on  Me  A  Female  representative I come  And with a prologue which I call a broom  To brush the critic cobwebs from the room  Critics like spiders into corners creep  And at new plays their bloody revels keep  With some small venom close in ambush lie  Ready to seize the poor dramatic  Fly  The weak and heedless soon become their prey  But the strong  Blue bottle  will force its way  Clean well its wings and hum another day  Unknown to nature's laws we've here one evil  For  Flies  turn'd  Spiders  play the very devil  But why chuse me to fill a woman's place  Have I about me any female grace  Sweetness of smile or lilydimpled face  Whate'er I have I'll try my winning ways  Low'ring my voice and rising from my stays  Warm with anxiety this hat my fan  I'm now an  Auth'ress  and no longer man  The ladies I am sure my brat will spare  For I'm not young nor am I over fair  Assemblies balls deck'd out I ne'er appear at  My husband is the only man I leer at  Ye  Beaux  whose minds are flimzy as your shapes  Who scorn all writing as the fox the grapes  Let not a woman's faults ill humours breed  I own my failingsI both write and read  Cries  Sit still two hours for one not fair nor young  You would not wait for  Venus  half so long  Could I please  Pit  You  and  Gallâ–ª  YOU more patient folks  With some small nature and some harmless jokes  These  Boxe  splendid rows would not their mite deny  They will as well as you both laugh and sigh  Sigh when you laugh and laugh whene'er you cry  Ye  Soldiers Sailors  valiant as you're free  O lend your aid protect my babe and me  Cowards spare none but you the truly brave  Women and children will for ever save  Here ends my taskand for our last expedient  The auth'ress makes you this  Curtseys  and this  Bows  Your most obedient  Speedily will be published  In FOUR VOLUMES Twelves TWO NOVELS  The first intituled  THE

Harriet Mrs SMITH  THE SCHOOL FOR RAKES  ACT I  SCENE  an Apartment in Lord  EUSTACE  's House  Enter Mr  FRAMPTON  and  WILLIS  Fram  WELL Willis they are come  Wil  Yes Sir but I am quite of opinion they will soon be gone again at least out of this house for as I assisted in carrying in their trunks and bandboxes merely to contemplate their countenances I cou'd perceive the strongest marks of dissatisfaction in Sir William's face and when the servants retir'd from the parlour I overheard him and his sister Winifred in high disputationBoth their Welch bloods were up and a fine splutter there was between them but tho' you might  have heard them into HydePark they spoke so quick that I cou'd only pick up an odd word here and there as if Sir William did not like this part of the town  Fram  I wish they had staid in the country with all my heart  Wil  I believe there are more people of that mind than you Sir I fancy my lord wou'd give a good round sum that they had remained fixed to the freehold at LangwillanTho' to be sure Miss Harriet is by many degrees the handsomest girl that ever his lordship was fond of  Fram  You must not Willis talk of her in that stileShe is a young woman both of character and family  Wil  So much the better for her Sir if she has a good family of her own for I am pretty sure she never will belong to ours  Fram  I must again desire you Mr Willis not to speak so lightly of this affairthe real friends of your lord will not be much inclin'd to mirth or ridicule upon this occasion I can tell you  Wil  As we were both placed here by my lord to manage this matter for him I thought there cou'd be no great harm to argue a little upon it Mr Frampton  Fram  I am not at present in a humour for conversation  Wil  O Sir another time will do as well  Fram  I wou'd have you go immediately and acquaint lord Eustace with their arrivalLet him also know that I shall wait upon the ladies and make his apology for not being here to receive them  Wil  You have been very obliging to his lordship upon many such occasions Mr Frampton  but I fancy he never stood more in need of your assistance and mine too than he does at present  Fram  Tho' in the same cause I believe our services will tend to different purposesI shall not flatter his vices  Wil  Lord Mr Frampton you are grown so prudish of late  Fram  You are grown too familiar Mr WillisYou'll oblige me and obey your lord's commands at the same time by going directly with the message I desired you  Wil  I did not mean to offend you Sir by observing how useful your friendship has been to my lordHas your honour any farther commands  Fram  None but those I gave you  Wil  Aside  Here's more to do with these shabby ruin'd hangerson of my lord's than all the family besideI think myself as good a man as he and if he had not a little too much spirit for me I wou'd tell him as much  Exit grumbling  Fram  To what a state have I reduced myself when even such a wretch as that dares to upbraid me What now remains of all the scenes of mirth and revelry which I have been partaker of beneath this roof A ruin'd fortune a disturb'd mind and a broken constitution are the only mementos that are now left meYet I think I have fortitude sufficient to bear all thesebut to be obliged to minister to another man's vices for a wretched subsistence is to degrade human nature below the brutesThank heaven however I have escap'd being concern'd in this iniquitous affair and tho' my friendship for lord Eustace will not suffer me to desert him in his present difficulties I am determin'd  to proceed no farther than is consistent with my honour and my peaceI have consented to see the lady and excuse his absenceI must wait for Sir William's going out and then hasten to fulfil my promise  Exit  SCENE  changes to another Apartment  Sir  WILLIAM  Mrs  WINIFRED  HARRIET  in travelling dressestrunks  bags c  BETTY  attending  Sir Wm  I tell you again and again sister Wini  I am not satisfied  Mrs Win  As to that matter brother you know you never are satisfied with what any person does  yourself I shall therefore make myself perfectly ea  y on that head  Sir Wm  That's more than I shall be while I am  n this house I can tell youI have very solid objections to staying hereA young idle rakish lord  Mrs Win  What a vulgar objection I declare Sir William if I were not acquainted with your ancestry I should suspect you to be descended from mechanics But I hope the family of Ap Evans is known to be quite as ancient as  Sir Wm  Adam at least sisterBut let me now inform you that lord Eustace is placed in a much higher rank than any of your boasted ancestors have ever been and that I hate obligations to persons above me for the only satisfaction I ever felt in receiving favours arose from the prospect of repaying them  Mrs Win  Pride absolute pride brother  Sir Wm  It is an honest one at least you must allow that inclines persons to discharge their debts of honour as well as of law  Mrs Win  Pray Sir William give me leave to ask you where is the mighty matter of interchanging civilities between persons of a certain rankLord Eustace spent some months at your house in the country  Sir Wm  Not by my invitation sister but yoursYou know I was at my estate in Devonshire the greatest part of the time he spent at LangwillanI have therefore neither right nor inclination to accept of his houseBesides it is extremely inconvenient to me as I have so much business to transact in Lincoln's Inn  Mrs Win  You should have written to your broker then to provide you apartments in some of the stoves on t'other side TempleBar Sir Williambut as to my niece and me we don't chuse to be suffocated I must inform you  Sir Wm  Why this place as you say is airy enoughWhen I was last in London about twelve years ago there was not a house within a mile of itbut all the fools in the nation have now crouded up to the capital and made the head too large for the body and this very place where I used to send my horses to graze begins now to look something like a street  Mrs Win  Like a street Sir William  Sir Wm  Let us have done with wrangling sister I give it upthis air may be better for my girlI shall stay here therefore for the short time I remain in town tho' I don't like itYou are content I hopeBut what says my Harriet Why so grave I expected to have seen you as blithe as  one of the kids upon our mountains at your arrival in London  Har  I find myself a little fatigued Sir  Sir Wm  You were all life and spirit during our journeythe bad air of this town can't have affected you already child But tell me how you like this house  Har  I think it very retired Sir  Mrs Win  Why really Miss Harriet I don't believe my lord intended following business or opening shop when he took it but surely for persons of distinction it is the very spot one wou'd desire I am astonished at your want of taste childSir William I know loves noiseI think there is nothing else left to wish for here  Har  Aside  Except the owner of the mansion  Betty  Pray madam which is to be my young lady's appartment  Mrs Win  That upon the righthand childYou had better go with her Harriet and adjust your DressO Betty bid 'em look in the coach for my snuffbox they'll find it on the seat or in the pockets  Exit Harriet and Betty  Don't you think you shall be full late for your lawyers Sir William  Sir Wm  Yes as I have so far to go to themWho is there  Enter  BETTY  with the snuffbox  Betty  Here's the box madam  gives it to her and exit  Enter  ROBERT  Send David for a Hackneycoachtake this key and bring me a parcel of papers which you will find tied up in my strong box Robert  Rob  Yes Sir  Exit Robert  Mrs Win  I hope Sir William you have your address written upon your cards and that you have ordered your letters to be directed to Lord Eustace's House As his Lordship honours me with his friendship I think it necessary that our Acquaintance shou'd be informed of his great politeness  Sir Wm  Aside  His lordship honours me with his friendshiphow well the traffic is kept up in that phrase between vanity and vanity I had ordered my letters to Serle's Coffeehouse but since it is determined that I must stay here I shall direct them to be sent to me  Mrs Win  I must beg Sir William that you will order all the newspapers and magazines to be sent here also My mental faculties are quite at a standI have not had the least political information these four days  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  Here are the papers Sir  Mrs Win  Are they of this day Robert  Sir Wm  They are of much older date sister and will not I fancy afford you much entertainmentGet me my hat and cane do you know Robert where captain Lloyd lodges  Rob  In Cravenstreet Sir they told me at Trevallin  Sir Wm  Direct the Coachman there  Exit Robert  Mrs Win  For Heaven's sake Sir William what do you loiter for It will be monstrous late before you can returnyou won't be back by dinner  Sir Wm  You seem so very impatient for my setting out sister that I cannot imagine you shou'd  be very anxious for my coming back again I shall go first to captain Lloyd's  Mrs Win  You are doubtless at liberty to go where you please Sir Williambut I hope you will not think of incumbering us with his visits here  Sir Wm  You amaze menot receive the uncle of the man who is to marry my daughter  Mrs Win  That may be sooner said than done I fancy Sir William  Sir Wm  You are mistakenI never yet have falsified my promise  Mrs Win  A pretty alliance truly for my niece and your daughter But let me tell you Sir if Harriet had not a shilling her family and her beauty wou'd intitle her to a much better match than your colonel who has nothing but an old tottering castle a scarlet coat and a sword to settle by way of jointure  Sir Wm  Your absurdity distracts me What has your family and beauty done for you And I dare say you once rated them as high as you do Harriet's  Mrs Win  You'll pardon me brother I understand genealogy better than sotho' there is not a very great difference between my niece's years and mine she has one generation more in her table than I which let me tell you is of no small consequence to those who know how to set a proper value upon family  Sir Wm  Family Nonsense Let those who have no other merit to support them build on that but know that I despise it and to make an end of this ridiculous altercation for ever I shall inform you that eight years ago when Harriet was but a child and the colonel was sent young abroad  to serve his country I liked him so well that I promised his father if the young fellow return'd with life and honour my daughter shou'd be his  Mrs Win  I have ever disapproved of that method of affiancing young personsHave you no idea that it is possible the colonel may dislike your daughter  Sir Wm  I am not very apprehensive on that account  Mrs Win  Have you no fears of her refusing him  Sir Wm  NoneBred up in retirement and innocence she can have formed no attachment and her obedience to a fond father will certainly incline her to dispose of both her hand and heart where his prudence shall direct  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  Sir the coach is ready  Sir Wm  Looking at his watch  'Tis later than I thought it wasWhy I shan't be back to dinnerI shall go nowhere but to the captain's if I don't meet with him I shall return directly Put up these papers Robert  Exit Sir William  Mrs Win  Desire Miss Evans to come to me and pray good Robert send out for the last Gazette directly There may be a thousand treaties on foot that I am ignorant of  Exit Robert  What an absurd man is my brother His ideas are dreadfully confinedHis daughter's hand and heart will follow her obedience thank heaven they are not now to be disposed of  Enter  HARRIET  What not begun to dress niece  Har  My spirits are too much agitated madam to think of dress  Mrs Win  For heaven's sake child don't talk in this doleful strain to meI can easily conceive that your father's presence may distress you as he is so totally ignorant of your good fortunebut with me it appears ridiculous  Har  I am indeed madam infinitely distressed by my father's ignorance of my situation  Mrs Win  What a fuss is here about your father You know he wou'd never have given his consent to your marrying lord Eustace if he had been askedhe hates men of quality and as my lord is not yet in possession of his fortune I doubt if he wou'd even have thought it a good match  Har  I wish he were acquainted with it be it good or bad  Mrs Win  I tell you child I lost two excellent matches myself by waiting for advice and by that means giving time to the parties to consider of it so it came to nothingbut I now tell you that by my prudence your good fortune does not admit of a doubt  Har  Wou'd to heaven it did not  Mrs Win  You are the very counterpart of your father never content with any thingAre you not intitled to  supporters  and  coronets  upon your coach And when the Evans's arms are quartered with my lord's and well emblazoned there won't be so handsome an equipage in London  Har  Yet the possessor may be wretched madam  Mrs Win  Wretched and a countess I think that scarce possible But what is it you wou'd have  child Have I not with the greatest address imaginable managed matters with my headstrong brother and triumphed over his obstinacy Are you not at this instant lodged in your husband's house  Har  What is his house while he is absent from it I hoped to have met him heremy letters must have informed him  Mrs Win  Perhaps his and your father my lord Delville Harriet may have claimed his lordship's attendance It is only people of no consequence who are masters of themselves and therefore pretend to dignify their insignificance with the title of independence But persons of quality my dear never presume to rebel against the laws of subordinationBut this is a political secret which you are yet ignorant of child  Har  He appeared to be perfect master of his own time when we were first acquainted nor did his engagements seem to interfere with his inclinations till after you had commanded me to receive his hand  Mrs Win  'Till after I commanded you Really Miss Evans any person who was to hear you talk in this manner might suppose that I had compelled you to marry lord Eustace but perhaps miss you had rather have been sacrificed to your father's ridiculous attachment to colonel Loyd and been buried alive in the old castle of Trevallin  Har  Notwithstanding all your attention to my happiness madam if my lord no longer loves me I must be miserable  Mrs Win  Can he hinder your being a countess simpleton But prithee what can have put all these melancholy thoughts into your head Did ever any man appear to be more in love than he  Har  O no he was all tenderness he wept at our parting I wept too yet found a pleasing softness in that grief he seemed to shareWhat a change  Mrs Win  Revolutions are common in all states child and if you understood politics you would not be so much surprized at them  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  Mr Frampton madam desires to see my young lady  Har  Mr Frampton I don't know such a person do you know him Robert  Rob  I know nothing more of him madam than that he lives in this house and has a fine man to attend him There are a power of people coming and going but I can't tell who they be  Mrs Win  Aside to Harriet  He must certainly be a friend or relation of your lord'sI think we had better step into the parlour to receive him lest your father's return should interrupt us We will see the gentleman below Robert and wait on him directly  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to a Garden Parlour  Enter Mr  FRAMPTON  Fram  I feel myself extremely shocked at this affair both for lord Eustace and the unhappy girlit is an infamous business and I am certain it must turn out ill  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  The ladies will wait upon you immediately Sirâ–ª  Exit Robert  Fram  Would the interview were overIf she is but half so amiable as lord Eustace has described her I fear I shall acquit myself but indifferently of his commissionBeauty that makes most men knaves makes me honest for I hold it the lowest baseness to be capable of admiring and betraying an innocent creature in the same moment  Enter Mrs  WINIFRED  and  HARRIET  Fram  I come madam from lord Eustace to your ladyship  Mrs Win  By acosting my niece in that manner Sir I suppose you are one of his lordship's particular friends but pray be more guarded Sir and do not call my niece ladyshipthat time is not yet come  Fram  I stand corrected madam  Har  How does lord Eustace Sir I hope he is well  Fram  Perfectly so madam though extremely concerned at having it not in his power to receive your ladyship  Mrs Win  Again Sir  Fram  The moment of your arrivalbut his attendance on his father who is at present ill in Berkshire prevented him that happiness  Mrs Win  Aye I knew itDid not I tell you so Miss Harriet  Har  Pray Sir when may we expect to see lord Eustace I hope his father's illness is not dangerous  Fram  No madam I hope not though old mens lives are certainly precarious I am sure your lord will leave him the first moment it is possible as I well know he burns with impatience to throw himself at your feet  Mrs Win  I hope your mind is easy now childShe may be a countess sooner than I thought for and if my lord can get into the ministry I may be of some consequence to my friends  Aside  Har  I am much obliged to you Sir for the trouble you have takenI by no means wish that lord Eustace should neglect his duty to lord Delville or distress himself in any other way on my account though I sincerely desire the happiness of seeing him  Fram  His inclinations madam I am satisfied more than keep pace with yours and you may with great probability expect to see his lordship either today or tomorrow morning  Mrs Win  You alarm me vastly Sir I would not have his lordship catch us in this deshabille for any consideration I beg child you will go to your toiletBless me what figures we are  Har  I shall attend you madam You have made me very happy Sirbut do you think that he will come to night  Fram  I fear it is not in his power madam  Har  Come when he will I shall rejoice to see him  Mrs Win  Pray niece come away now Sir your humble servantYou don't know but his lordship may be here in a few minutes  To Harriet  Exit Mrs Win and Har  Fram  I never lied with a worse graceBy heaven that girl is an angel and lord Eustace of course a devil What a delicate sensibility in her countenance what softness in her voice The man who could first injure and then forsake such a woman deserves to be marked as the most infamous because he must be the most cruel of his sexI have some consolation in thinking that lord  Eustace tho' ten years younger is ten times a greater  Enter Lord  EUSTACE  behind  Ld Eust  What what FramptonI will lay ten thousand pounds that is impossible tho' you did not finish the sentenceDo you think I shou'd lose Frampton  Fram  I certainly do my lord tho' you were to determine the bet yourself But this is no time for fooling I am astonished at your imprudenceI thought you had determin'd not to come this night what can have changed your purpose  Ld Eust  Have you seen Harriet Frampton and can you ask that question My mind restless distracted and impatient has impelled me hitherBut tell me have you seen her  Fram  I have seen lady Eustace  Ld Eust  You startle me don't talk so loudare you sure that no one can overhear us  Fram  Not a creatureSir William is gone abroad and the ladies are retired to dress  Ld Eust  What said Harriet to my absence  Fram  The tears which seemed to have dimned her lovely eyes reproached you silently but not an angry word escaped her lips  Ld Eust  Do not add to my distress Frampton By heaven my heart bleeds for the unhappy Harriet Had I like you been born a private man and not at once bound down by the vile tramels of family and dependence the world should not have bribed me to forsake her  Fram  The sense you now seem to have of your own situation shou'd have operated sooner my  lord and prevented your involving an innocent young woman in certain ruin  Ld Eust  No Frampton no that was beyond my power I loved her to distractionnay I do love her stillbut let us talk no more upon this subject it softens me into weakness and as I am dependent on my father I must obey himI hope she has not heard of my intended marriage  Fram  No no the devil is too great a gainer by your schemes to blast them  Ld Eust  Don't you think it is rather too late in the day for you to turn methodist Ned  Fram  It is never too late my lord for a man to condemn and forsake his follies and young as you are I heartily wish this was the time appointed for your doing so likewise  Ld Eust  These sentiments have at least the grace of novelty to recommend them from you Mr Frampton  Fram  My sentiments my lord are of little consequence to you but the time draws near when you must justly suffer in the opinion of one who ought to be dear to you Miss Evans cannot be much longer deceivedand when I reflect upon the vile artifices that were used to draw her into a feigned marriage by heaven I cannot help detesting you and every one of the infernal agents who were any way concerned in it  Ld Eust  O Frampton my heart tells me that I deserve your detestationWhy why were you not with me to save me from the sad effects of my wild youthful passionsThe wretches who were near me but inflam'd them  Fram  The attachments of mean persons are always founded in selfinterest my lord nor was there ever yet a solid friendship form'd in vice  Ld Eust  Don't upbraid me with my miseries Frampton but think what a situation is mine Tho' I feel the errors of my conduct and wou'd repair them I am so much involved in my own toils that I find it impossible to break themWhat wou'd I not give even to postpone this fatal marriage  Fram  Postpone it aye for ever  Ld Eust  Cou'd I do that I might yet be happy Frampton but matters are gone too farevery thing was settled between my father and lady Anne's guardians before I came to town and I am certain he never will be brought to relinquish the great advantage of her immense fottune  Fram  And can you my lord be brought to consider those advantages as an equivalent for your peace and honour  Ld Eust  What wou'd you have me do  Fram  Avow your situation to lord Delville  Ld Eust  Were it a common folly I had committed Frampton I might hope for his forgiveness but the infamy which must deservedly attend my conduct in this affair wou'd probably make him cast me from his heart and fortune for ever  Fram  You are certainly in very difficult circumstances my lord nor can I discover any means of extricating you from them  Ld Eust  The only miserable hope I have now left is founded on the gentleness of Harriet's nature which may enable me to prevail on her to return into the country before she hears of my intended marriage  Fram  It is rather shameful my lord to erect a sanctuary for our vices upon the virtues of others  Ld Eust  I acknowledge it Frampton but were Harriet remov'd from the probability of hearing of this hateful marriage my mind wou'd be more at  ease and I might then possibly think of some expedient to break it off  Fram  There is some merit in that thought my lord and now let me know how I can serve you  Ld Eust  You shall hearThat villain Langwood my father's steward who persuaded me into this sham marriage and personated the clergyman on that occasion is now dying and writes me word that he is distracted with the horrors of his conscience and is determined to ask the young lady's forgivenessa letter from him to the family wou'd discover all  Fram  That wou'd indeed be fatal but how can I prevent it  Ld Eust  You must remain in this house and take care that my servants prevent their receiving any letters without bringing them first to you I will order Willis to intercept them  Fram  He is fit for the office but this is a very odious affair my lord However I have promis'd to assist you and if I can prevail upon myself I will go so far as to prevent Langwood's hastening the catastrophe which I much fear will be a sad one  Ld Eust  You know not how you torture me But let me now indulge my fond impatience and see my lovely Harriet  Fram  You must not think of it I wou'd advise you to retire directly  Ld Eust  It is impossible I shou'd obey you I long yet dread to see her Frampton  Fram  It will require a good deal of courage my lord to support the interview for I really think that an injured innocent woman is a very formidable objectBut tho' you may be brave enough for the encounter I must prevent it for the present as I have but just now apologized for your absence  by telling her you were in Berkshire with your father and the inconsistency of your immediate appearance might justly alarm herI wou'd therefore have you withdraw immediately lest any of the family shou'd see you  Ld Eust  You have a right to direct me and at your desire I will defer my visit for a little time but I can have no rest 'till I behold her  Fram  I don't fancy your meeting will contribute much to the quiet of your mind  Ld Eust  I do not hope it shou'dBut never yet was that mind so distressed since it had first the power of thinking  Fram  Peace and guilt seldom cohabit my lord  Ld Eust  True Frampton trueand if young men like myself wou'd but calculate the pains and difficulties which are the natural consequences of vice and how much they overbalance its transitory joys they wou'd be shocked at a traffic where certain loss must be the reward of their industry  Fram  The being sensible of our errors is the first step to amendment for no man ever sets seriously about getting out of debt 'till he is thoroughly apprized of the vast sum he owesBut come my lord let us retire immediately I hear some of the family in motionthis way quickly  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  a DrawingRoom in Lord  EUSTACE  's House  Enter Lord  EUSTACE  Ld Eust  I Feel the force of Frampton's sentiments and tremble at the thoughts of seeing Harriet and yet I cannot deny myself this last indulgence If my father were acquainted with my distress perhapsO no I must not think of thatCursed ambitiondetested pride of familythat makes us sink the man to aggrandize the peer  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  The ladies will wait on your lordship immediately  Exit  Ld Eust  I am glad the aunt comes with herHer folly and impertinence will help to interrupt what I most dread my Harriet's tenderness and sensibility She comesI feel her superiority and shrink to nothing  Enter Miss  HARRIET  she runs a few Steps towards Lord  EUSTACE  then stops suddenly in Confusion  Ld Eust  My Harriet's first motion was surely natural why then does she restrain the feelings of her heart Have I been so unfortunate as to deserve this coldness  Enter Mrs  WINIFRED  Ld Eust  I hope madam  to Mrs Winifred  you will be so good as to excuse my absence at the time of your arrival and that you have found every thing in this house agreeable and convenient to you  Mrs Win  Ceremony my lord is quite unnecessary among persons of rank and breeding especially where they have the honour of being so closely allied to your lordship And I have great reason to believe that every thing in your house is like your lordship perfectly compleat  Ld Eust  You are very polite madam and if my Harriet knew what I had suffered  Har  I might then have been more concerned than I am at present and that my lord is needless  Mrs Win  I hop'd we shou'd have had an end of your sighs and your tears when you saw lord EustaceI declare child you are a perfect NiobeOne wou'd imagine that you were the most unhappy creature in the world  Ld Eust  You alarm me extremely madamSpeak my love and tell me what affects you  Har  Your lordship may remember with what great reluctance I consented to a private marriage  Ld Eust  My Harriet's scruples cost me too many sighs ever to forget them  Har  Yet your too powerful persuasions conquer'd them and while you remain'd in Wales your presence silenc'd my reflections nor suffered even a painful thought to intrude into that heart which was ingross'd by you What a delirium  Ld Eust  May it last for ever  Har  It fled with you my lordLeft to myself the offence I had committed against an absent fatherthe clandestine air which accompanied the awful ceremony  Mrs Win  Pray niece cou'd that be avoided  Har  The painful necessity of your absence  Ld Eust  Let me I intreat you flatter myself that my presence now may be sufficient to remove the anxiety my absence causedWhat wou'd I not do to make my Harriet happy Command me task my power  Har  I would intreat but not command my lord  Ld Eust  Then name the soft request and think it granted  Har  Since you permit I wish you to employ that dear pursuasive art which you possess so amply to reconcile my father to our marriage  Ld Eust  My dearest Harriet  Har  You madam sure will join us and assist in bringing about an event which cannot longer be deferr'd without injury to your honour and my peace  Mrs Win  I am his lordship's guarantee that this treaty shall be kept secret Harriet and I shall preserve my promise as inviolably as if the peace of Europe were concern'd And to avoid the least infringement of the articlcs I will prevent Sir William's surprizing you in this state of altercation and give you notice of the enemy's approach  Exit  Har  If ever I was dear to you my lord this is the time to prove it remove the veil of mystery which I blush to wear and give that love which is my highest boast a sanction to the world  Ld Eust  Never was man so embarrass'd  Aside  I will obey my Harriet tho' in opposition to my own judgment which had determined me not to reveal the important secret to Sir William till our return into the country lest the warmth of his resentment for what he will stile an act of disobedience might tempt him to discover our marriage to my father  Har  Must it be ever kept a secret then And must we always live thus separated  Ld Eust  By no meansI can make a pretence to my father of joining my regiment and then can I retrace those paths that brought me first to Langwillan and the moment I arrive there Sir William shall be made acquainted with my happiness  Har  Do you mean to come there soon my lord  Ld Eust  I shou'd have been there in a few days if you had not come to town  Har  Why did you not tell me so the least hint of your design would have prevented my coming to London  Ld Eust  Does my Harriet think I would delay my own happiness by deferring an interview I so ardently desired even for an hour  Har  You can persuade me to any thing I acquiesce in your determinationThere is but one thing more disturbs my mind but that's a trifle  Ld Eust  It cannot be so in my estimation if it affects youLet me know it  Har  Where there is much sensibility the heart is easily alarmedIt has appeared extraordinary to me that your lordship in any of your letters to me has never honour'd me with the title of your wife  Ld Eust  And can my Harriet blame me for such a caution meant to secure her happiness If my fortunes only were at stake I shou'd now boast what I so much endeavour to conceal nor fear the consequence of lord Delville's resentment The miscarriage or interception of a letter sign'd your husband wou'd precipitate the discovery of our marriage and ruin me with my father  Har  I wou'd not have you suffer for my sake  Ld Eust  It is only thro' you that I can sufferHad my fortune been independent I shou'd at once have asked you of Sir WilliamNay situated as I am I can forego all the advantages of wealth without regret and blest with you only lament its loss for your dear sakeYou weep my Harriet Let me kiss off those tears  Har  No let them flow my lordJoy has its tears as well as grief and these are tears of joy  Embracing him  Ld Eust  My lovely softnessHow severely she distresses me  Aside  Har  I will not trust this simple heart again and blush to think it was so easily alarmed  Enter Mrs  WINIFRED  in a Hurry  Mrs Win  Softly softly here comes my brotherhave done with your loveprateWhat always a pouting Harriet  Enter Sir  WILLIAM  speaking to  ROBERT  Sir Wm  Give the coachman half a crownand do you hear Robert let there be springs put to our coachevery one has them nowLuxury luxury Every alderman and apothecary skims  over this newfangled pavement without so much as a joltOne of these city sparks wou'd be shook to death if he were to ride my Bay Bolton a fox chace  Mrs Win  My brother is always his own herald and proclaims himself by the noise he makesHow detestably vulgar how unlike a man of fashionHere is lord Eustace come to wait upon you Sir William  Sir Wm  I am glad to see your lordship you have been a good while absent from quartersBut you young men of quality can have leave of absence when you please I suppose and all you have to do is to appear handsomely on a field day or at a review It was not so in my timeBut discipline of every kind is relaxed nowadays  Ld Eust  I have been a truant Sir William but I mean to make up for lost time and return immediately to my regiment and then look to your partridge  Sir Wm  You shall be welcome to my manor my lordHow does my Harriet I think you look pale Don't you think her alter'd my lord  Ld Eust  Rather improv'd Sir  Sir Wm  She used to be remarkably lively but as girls grow up they affect gravity in order to appear women before their timeHer brother and she are all I have left and when Harriet is married  Mrs Win  Lord Sir William are you entering into familymatters  Sir Wm  Well well we won't talk of that now but since we are upon the subject I think I ought to congratulate your lordship  Ld Eust  It must be then Sir William upon  the happiness I at present enjoy in the company of these ladies  Har  What does my father mean  Aside  Sir Wm  No no my lord I meant to give you joy of your approaching marriage  Har  Surely my ears deceive me  Aside  Ld Eust  You jest Sir William  Sir Wm  By no means I assure youI have it from undoubted authority  Mrs Win  Ridiculous  Sir Wm  I tell you sister that it is in one of today's papersI know what I read sure  Mrs Win  Did it mention how things go in the Mediterranean that is an article which concerns us moreWe shall not have a port left us there soon  Sir Wm  I speak only of domestic news and mind no otherThe paragraph I saw ran thus  We hear there is certainly a treaty of marriage on foot between lord Eustace and lady Anne Mountfort which will be concluded in a few days  and then a great deal more my lord about both your accomplishments which I have forgot  Mrs Win  I never knew any thing come of a  We hear  yetBut I wish you had brought home the paper  Ld Eust  Ha ha haAnd is that your undoubted authority Sir William Why at this season of the year when occurrences are rare the news writers couple half the nobility in England to fill up their papersBut as there are no other papers fill'd up by the parties themselvesyour marriages in print are not allow'd good in law  Mrs Win  How can you be so easily disconcerted child  Aside to Harriet  Sir Wm  I think it highly insolent in them my lord to take these liberties without authority as such reports may sometimes happen to be prejudicial to one party or the other  Ld Eust  The freedom of the press Sir William tho' sometimes injurious to individuals must never be restrain'd in this land of liberty 'Tis the very  Magna Charta  of freedom  Mrs Win  So it is my lord  Ld Eust  However there have been some slight grounds for the report you mention  Sir Wm  So I should imagine  Ld Eust  Lady Anne's large fortune was rather a desirable object to my fatherhe did therefore propose my paying my addresses to her but upon my declaring that love should be my first motive in an engagement of that nature and that my heart had never given me the least hint of her ladyship he had the goodness to sacrifice his project to my happiness The affair had been whisper'd in our family and even whispers have echoes Sir William  Sir Wm  Your lordship has taken more pains than was necessary to explain this matter to us For tho' you shou'd not marry lady Anne it is to be suppos'd that you'll soon marry a lady Betty or a lady Mary SomebodySuch an accomplish'd young nobleman will not be suffer'd to remain long single  Mrs Win  Lord Sir William how can you talk so oddly There are many instances of persons who have lived single in spite of temptation and solicitation too and that to your certain knowledge I believe  Sir Wm  You'll pardon me sister I am really  not acquainted with any of these coy these sensitive plants  Mrs Win  You seem inclin'd to be witty brother and therefore I shall retire  Ld Eust  I should oppose the severity of that resolution madam but that an engagement of business calls me away at this moment May I hope for your permission to wait upon you frequently while you stay in town  Mrs Win  Your lordship's visits must always be consider'd by us both as an honour and an obligation  Ld Eust  My sweet HarrietLadies your servantI hope we shall often meet Sir William  Bows to Harriet  Nay no ceremony  Sir Wm  Your lordship must excuse me  Exit Ld Eust and Sir Wm  Mrs Win  With what nice delicacy and honour has my nephew explain'd away this idle report But I am amazed how you could be affected with it child  Har  Chide me as you please I own I deserve it for doubting the most amiable of men Yet when my father hinted the subject I should have fainted if the tenderness of my lord's looks even more than his words had not convinc'd me of his love and truth Our fears are proportion'd to our treasure you cannot therefore condemn my apprehensions without lessening his worth  Mrs Win  That I shall never do Persons of a certain rank in life are always worthyBut come child I am in a monstrous dilemma at present  Har  What's the matter  Mrs Win  I want your assistance to calculate the distance from Persia to America for I have great  apprehensions that the Sophy may join the Czarina sail down the Baltic together and strip us of all our settlements  Har  Dear madam how can you trouble yourself with things so foreign either to your knowledge or interests  Mrs Win  I beg your pardon Why niece now that you are married to my satisfaction I know nothing in the domestic way worth being concern'd for and one's affections you know child cannot lie idletherefore I beg you will go immediately and search for Salmon's Geography which I believe you will find in my trunk along with Collins's Peerage which are books I never travel without and which no person can pretend to keep company without being thoroughly conversant in  Exeunt  Enter Sir  WILLIAM  and  ROBERT  Sir Wm  Prithee Robert was that man in the hall my lord's valet de chambre Of what use can he be to his master here  Rob  Of a great deal I fancy Sir There are numbers of people come here after his lord A fine lady just now wanted to gain admittance but Mr Willis had dacity enough to make her disbelieve her own senses and persuaded her that his master was down at Bristol tho' she said her eyes saw him come into the house O these Londoners are cunning folk  Sir Wm  You told me of another person that lives here a gentleman I think  Rob  Yes poor fellow I believe he may be an honest man because Willis don't seem much to like  himBut 'tis hard to say which is good or bad amongst them  Sir Wm  Aside  There is something very mysterious in all thisI desire Robert that you will have as little communication as possible with his lordship's servants and that you will prevent the rest of my family from having any also  Rob  Your honour need not fearThey are not kindly to any of us  Sir Wm  I am glad of itCivility is the most dangerous mask of art  Aside  My sister's folly in forcing us into this house can only be equall'd by my own in submitting to come to it But I will get out of it as fast as I can I hope Robert to finish my business in a few days and I shall not remain in London an hour after  Rob  Your honour makes my heart glad  Sir Wm  Do you know where Harriet is Robert I left her here just now  Rob  I saw her go up stairs with madam Winifred as we came hither Sir I think with submission our young lady likes London as little as either your worship or myself she mopes mightily to be in the country again  Sir Wm  She shan't mope long for that Robert nor when she is there neither for I intend to settle her soon both to her happiness and my own by marrying her to colonel Loyd immediately And when the wedding is over and I am once more sat down safe at Langwillan I shall think all my troubles are at an endI'll go to Harriet directly and talk the matter over with her  Rob  And I'll go and write the good news to my friends in Wales  Exeunt  SCENE  Mr Frampton's Apartment  Enter Mr  FRAMPTON  and  WILLIS  Fram  To barricade the doors and deny admitance to their friends  Wil  These were his lordship's orders SirWillis says he with an arch look which I understand pretty tolerably you must be my Cerberus and not suffer the devil himself to get thro' the keyhole for a few days But as soon as I am married and gone off to the country your care will be needlessYes says I to his lordship I will then make my escape out of the gulph leave the doors open for all the devils to enter and pursue your lordship to the Elysian fields  Fram  You are very poetical Mr WillisBut I fancy his lordship is rather over cautious and that you will have no great employment for your extraordinary talents for I don't think the family have any acquaintance in London  Wil  More is the pity for the girl is devilish handsome It wou'd be a good deed to bring her a little into lifeI shou'd like to have the introducing her  Fram  Stop your licentious tongueI have already told you that this is no common affairShe is a young lady of unblemished character  Wil  This the old story Mr Frampton I never knew a woman in my life who had not an unblemished charactertill she lost itThis fellow is turn'd puritan he'll preach presentlyBut I hope his canting will not be able to corrupt my lordThis would be no place for me then I fancy he likes the girl himself  Aside  Fram  Believe me Willis lord Eustace will find it a very difficult matter to get clear of this unhappy adventureSir William is a man of sense and spirit and the young lady has besides a brother in the army who is esteemed a brave young man  Wil  As to Don Pedro the father I think my lord had better get commodore Loyd to take a short walk with him upon the quarterdeck and as to the young Spaniard his lordship can't well refuse to take a bout of tilting with him if he should insist upon itBut I have been pretty well used to things of this sort as you know Mr Frampton and I never yet knew a wounded reputation cured by a sword or pistolPerhaps they may think as I do and so let the matter rest in peace  Fram  I shou'd imagine their sentiments to be very different from yours upon this occasionBut pray who is this captain Loyd that you talk of for Sir William's antagonist  Wil  There I was out a littleI forgot his being a Welchman and a particular friend of the Ap Evans's  Fram  But how came he connected with lord Eustace  Wil  They were acquainted before the captain went to sea and a jolly buck he was But he has now lost his ship and to solicit another he is as constant at lord Delville's levee as an old maid at her parish churchThe simile holds farther too for his head is cast in so peculiar a mould that he believes every thing he hears and repeats it as matter of fact  Fram  What an infinite deal of falshood must this honest man utter in the course of a summer's day  Wil  I will save his poor conscience for this one day at least by keeping him out of our fortress  Fram  It will be more necessary for your purpose to prevent telling his truths at present I imagine  Wil  Your honour knows it is not to be spoken at all times He has told a thousand for my master himself  Aside  Knocking at the door  I must fly to my post Sir  Exit  Fram  A fit one for such an office It is such wretches as these that corrupt us all that clear the thorny paths of vice and strew them o'er with rosesThese agents for perdition can remove mountains that obstruct our passage till we are sunk in the abyss of guilt and then their weight falls on us I would willingly persuade myself that lord Eustace is not so far gone in baseness as to conclude his marriage with lady Anne and desert this amiable unfortunate Yet can I not at present foresee how it may be possible for him to avoid it There is some time however to think about it I'll seek him out directly and try how his heart beats after his interview with Harriet  Exit  SCENE  Sir William's Apartment  Sir  WILLIAM  and  HARRIET  discover'd  Sir Wm  I am sorry to find you so cold upon this subject Harriet But I flatter myself when you come to know the colonel you will have no objections to him Believe me my child he is the only man I know deserving of an heart like yours untainted with the follies or vices of the world and unsullied with the image of any other man  Har  This is too much I cannot bear it  Aside  Sir  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  Captain Loyd is come to wait upon your honour  Sir Wm  Desire him to walk inAnd do ye hear Robert  They walk aside  Har  To be obliged to compound with my duty Ashamed to look my father in the face To blush at his confidence and be humbled by his kindness To feel the irksomeness of receiving praise which I am conscious I do not merit What a state for an ingenuous mind  Exit Robert  Enter at opposite Doors Mrs  WINIFRED  and Captain  LOYD  Mrs Win  O heavens that monster hereBut 'tis impossible now to escape  Aside  Capi  Good morrow my good friend Fair ladies your servant  Sir Wm  I am extremely glad to see you captain  Capt  Why so I thought you wou'd be baronet or I should not have been here and yet it has not been without some difficulty that we are met I fancied just now that I should have been obliged to tack about without seeing you  Sir Wm  I don't understand you captain  Capt  Why to say truth Sir William I don't rightly comprehend it myself but one of your lazy hall furniturethe most obstinate puppy I have seen him before tho' I can't now recollect where took it into his head to deny me admittance and if old Robert had not come to the door and clear'd deck of this fellow I shou'd have sheer'd off directly  Sir Wm  What can this mean Was it your orders sister that we shou'd be denied  Mrs Win  As our arrival in town has not yet been annonced to any one I did not expect visitors so soon and therefore gave no orders about the matterTho' I wish to keep him and all his family out of the house  Aside  Sir Wm  There is something very extrordinary in this proceeding  Aside  Capt  Since the wind sits so I am glad I came aboard you I shou'd not choose to run foul of a lady's orders especially any that belong to you  Sir Wm  You seem to have forgot these ladies captain this is my sister and this will soon be your niece I hope  Capt  They are both much altered since I saw them for one is grown a young woman and the other an old one  Mrs Win  You are not grown a brute for you always was one  Sir Wm  Have a care captain you are very near splitting on a rock  Capt  Not at allTime brings every vessel into port at last that does not founderBut faith my nephew has had an excellent look out I could almost envy him such a station A fine full sail trulyWell prosperous gales attend their voyageBut where is Harry I expected to have seen him here  Sir Wm  Whom do you speak of captain  Capt  Why of your son the young colonelI met him yesterday in the Park not in his regimentals tho' for he told me he was a little  incog  at present and had even changed his name for fear of being known I think it was Weston he called himself as he had quitted quarters without leave of absence and at the hazard of losing his commission  Sir Wm  And he deserves itWhat can have brought him here  Har  I rejoice at the thoughts of seeing him does he look well good captain  Mrs Win  Do you know where my nephew lodges Sir  Aside  Capt  I shou'd have as many tongues as there are swivels on the quarterdeck to answer such a broadside of questions but one at a time I beseech youAs to you madam I answer no and to you fair lady yes and as to you Sir William I think one need not have doubled the Cape to be able to find out his errand hither A fair woman and a fair wind certainly brought him from Ireland  Sir Wm  Rash inconsiderate boy  Capt  That may not be quite the case neither Sir William But I shou'd not have mentioned this matter to you if I had not thought it had been all aboveboard between him and you for Harry was never kept under hatches I knowBut never fear man keep a stout heart and I warrant you he shall weather it he shall not lose his commission  Mrs Win  I fancy Sir it may require the interest of a person of rather more consequence than you to preserve it But there are such who are ready to interest themselves for any one who belongs to my family the Ap Evans's are neither unknown nor unallied to the nobility  Capt  As to that madam I shou'd think the Loyds  Sir Wm  For shame for shameCan you who are a man be infected with this folly  Capt  Why 'tis not right or becoming a man of war to attack a frigate to be sureBut the Loyds Sir William  Sir Wm  Pisha  Mrs Win  Pray brother let the gentleman value himself upon what he pleases but 'tis rather unlucky that a person of his weight and importance  shou'd not be able to inform us where my nephew lodges as that is the only thing in which the captain could be any way serviceable to us  Capt  Not so fast Miss Winifred if you please there are many people in this town who are apt to make offer of their services without either will or power to be of the least use to us Now if you will tell me madam who those people are that you reckon upon I shall be better able to judge of your interest with the great  Mrs Win  What do you think of lord Eustace Did you ever hear of him captain  Capt  I suppose I may why he is one of my most intimate friends madam and I will speak to him about the business directly  Mrs Win  Pray now good captain spare yourself that trouble for he is one of  my most intimate friends  also It is he who has been so obliging to lend us this house while we stay in London  Capt  I do remember this place now as well as my own cabbinBut the impertinence of that footman whom I now recollect to be his put it out of my headYes my lord and I have had some jovial parties here  Sir Wm  What in this identical house  Capt  Why ayeThis used to be the place of rendezvousBut those days must be all over with him now that he is going to be married  Mrs Win and Har  How married  Capt  YesThe ceremony is to be performed immediately he'll soon be in the bilboesBut you seem surpriz'd'Tis odd enough truly that he has not mentioned it to you Miss Winifred in particular who are one of his  most intimate friends  When did you see him pray  Mrs Win  What again alarmed at the same story  Aside to Harriet  Sir Wm  He was here this morning and I knew it was so then tho' my sister chose not to believe it  Mrs Win  Nor do I nowBut pray Mr intelligencer extraordinary to whom is lord Eustace to be married  Capt  Why really madam it is no extraordinary intelligence that he is to marry lady Anne Mounfort for it is just as public as the arrival of a king's ship in the Downs or an Indiaman at BlackwallThe newspapers tell these things and every one in London knows them  Har  Gracious heaven Where shall I hide my head  Aside  Mrs Win  We have heard this choice account before Sir but tho' I have as implicit a faith in the veracity of the public prints as any person can have I wou'd however take my life on't that this is a falshood  Capt  You are not serious madam But if you chuse to deny the fact I have nothing further to say about it  Sir Wm  It is very odd that lord Eustace shou'd disown it to me and yet 'tis certain that he did so  Capt  That may be possible but I who am every day at his father's and have seen the liveries equipage and jewels brought home for the wedding cannot easily be persuaded that all this rigging shou'd be prepared before there is a bottom on stocks for it  Har  'Tis too true Undone unhappy Harriet  Aside to Mrs Winifred  Sir Wm  What think you now sister  Mrs Win  That the captain has dreamed all he has said or may be perhaps infected with a calenture for I think I have very good reason to know that lord Eustace is otherways engaged  Capt  Aye aye engag'd to be sure say rather that he has taken another frigate in tow to add to his squadron I know the man pretty well I now recollect my having heard some time ago that he had some attachment to a pretty country girl He was a long time absent from London  Mrs Win  A country girl truly  Sir Wm  Some poor simple creature I suppose who had youth and beauty enough to attract his inclinations but neither sense or virtue sufficient to preserve herself or them  Capt  This is probably the real truth of the matter  Sir Wm  Though I lament the unhappy victims of their own folly I cannot say that I am sorry such adventures happen sometimes as these examples may possibly have their effect in abating the presumption of young women who are often too apt to fancy themselves much wiser than their fathers and mothers  Har  I can no longer sustain the agonies I suffer  Aside Faints  Sir Wm  My Harriet my dear child what's the matter  Har  I am suddenly taken ill I hope you'll excuse me Sir  Mrs Win  Was there ever any thing so absurd Let us retire my dear and leave these wondermaking gentlemen to compose some other marvelous anecdotes  Exit Mrs Win and Har  Sir Wm  I am extremely alarmed  Aside  You'll be so good as to excuse my staying longer with you captain at present Harriet's illness distresses me extremely  Capt  Doubtless Sir WilliamI will now go and give chace to the colonel and if I can hail him shall pilot him hither  Sir Wm  I shall be much obliged to you  Capt  But you must not play old squaretoes upon us baronet Remember you were once as young and I'll warrant as frolicksome too as any of us Your servant your servant Sir William  Exit  Sir Wm  There is something very singular in this affair of lord EustaceMy sister's absurdity in denying the fact I can account for from the peculiar obstinacy of her character But why should Harriet be affected with it Her aunt's folly may have operated there also perhaps persuaded her that his lordship's common address of galantry and politeness was a profess'd declaration of passion for her But this marriage will soon put an end to such illusion and restore my child to her sense and duty again I will therefore go now and sooth not wound her mind with my surmisesThe soibles of youth should be rather counteracted than opposed lest in endeavouring to weed them out we may destroy a kindred virtue  Exit  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE  Frampton's Apartment  Enter  FRAMPTON  Fram  IT was unlucky I could not meet with lord Eustace I perceive I am more anxious about this affair than he appears to be Youth and dissipation buoy him up against those consequences which I cannot help foreseeing  Enter  WILLIS  with a Parcel of Letters  Wil  Here they are Sir and if you knew what pains and address it cost me to get them into my hands you would say Willis you deserve to be rewarded  Fram  With a halter  Aside  Wil  I was forced to swear to the fellow who brought them that I was Sir William's own servant and as the devil wou'd have it he was a Monmouthshire lad waiter at Serles's Coffeehouse and had come on purpose to ask a thousand impertinent questions about Gillian and John James and Mary Lewellins Ap Griffiths Ap Owens and the lord knows who Then my terrors about Robert surprizing us but luckily he was out of the way so I carried the lad to a beerhouse killed one half of his kindred and married the other without knowing one of the parties  Fram  What an ingenious rascal  Aside  You have acquitted yourself of your commission very wellLeave the letters  Wil  I hope Sir your honour will be so kind to let my lord know the pains I have taken for his service since you don't chu  e to take any notice of it yourselfIndustry should be rewarded Mr FramptonYou used to be generous Sir but  Farm  How the fellow wounds me  Aside  Your services will be repaid you have no cause to doubt of your lord's generosity  Wil  No really SirIf you don't prevent it  Aside  I fancy now I could guess pretty nearly to the contents of these epistles I wish I could keep them in my possession 'till I gave them to my lord and then I should be sure of being paid the postage  Aside  Let's seeTo Sir William Evans baronet the postmark Monmouth this probably comes from his steward and may possibly contain an account of a strayed sheep or a cur hangedThis to the same from Ireland from his son I presume the young hero you talked of about fighting my masterbut I think we are pretty safe while he's at that distance  Fram  I hope he may remain there 'till this unhappy business is over  Wil  To Mrs Winifred Evans postmark Hereford 'tis Langwood's handthis must be the letter of lettersAm I right Sir  Farm  Prithee leave them and your impertinenceYou have no right to pry into their secrets  Wil  I ask pardon Sir I have been trusted with a great many secrets before now and I believe your honour knows I never betrayed themAnd though I am not a gentleman Sir I believe my lord will give me the character of being faithful to him he never had any cause to repent his confidence in meWhatever he may  Aside  Fram  Leave the room this moment lest I should be tempted to forget myself and chastise your insolence as it deserves  Wil  I wish I had the letters again and the devil should have them before that sneaking puppy  Aside  Exit  Fram  What a mean light do I appear in at this moment to myself Involved in an infamous confidence with an insolent footmanLet me keep clear of the lookingglass that I may not be shocked at my own featuresAnd can I persist in an action that the least remains of honour or conscience must revolt against No let beggary rather than infamy be my portionMy indiscretions have deserved the first but let not the baseness of my conduct ever set a seal to the lastI will go and deliver them instantly to Sir William  As he is going out Enter Lord  EUSTACE  Ld Eust  Well my dear Frampton have you secur'd the letters  Fram  Yes my lord for their rightful owners  Ld Eust  As to the matter of property Frampton we wo'nt dispute much about thatNecessity you know may sometimes render a trespass excusable  Fram  I am not casuist sufficient to answer you upon that subject but this I know that you have already trespassed against the laws of hospitality and honour in your conduct towards Sir William Evans and his daughterAnd as your friend and counsellor both I would advise you to think seriously of repairing the injuries you have committed and not increase your offence by a farther violation  Ld Eust  'Tis actually a pity you were not bred to the bar Ned but I have only a moment to stay and am all impatience to know if there be a letter from Langwood and what he says  Fram  I shall never be able to afford you the least information upon that subject my lord  Ld Eust  Surely I don't understand youYou said you had secur'd the lettersHave you not read them  Fram  You have a right and none but you to ask me such a questionMy weak compliance with your first proposal relative to these letters warrants your thinking so meanly of meBut know my lord that though my personal affection for you join'd to my unhappy circumstances may have betray'd me to actions unworthy of myself I never can forget that there is a barrier fixed before the extreme of baseness which honour will not let me pass  Ld Eust  You'll give me leave to tell you Mr Frampton that where I lead I think you need not halt  Fram  You'll pardon me my lord the consciousness of another man's errors can never be a justification for our ownand poor indeed must that wretch be who can be satisfied with the negative merit of not being the worst man he knows  Ld Eust  If this discourse were uttered in a conventicle it might have its effect by setting the congregation to sleep  Fram  It is rather meant to rouze than lull your lordship  Ld Eust  No matter what it is meant for give me the letters Mr Frampton  Fram  Yet excuse meBy heaven I could as soon think of arming a madman's hand against  my own life as suffer you to be guilty of a crime that will for ever wound your honour  Ld Eust  I shall not come to you to heal the wound your medicines are too rough and coarse for me  Fram  The soft poison of flattery might perhaps please you better  Ld Eust  Your conscience may probably have as much need of palliatives as mine Mr Frampton as I am pretty well convinced that your course of life has not been more regular than my own  Fram  With true contrition my lord I confess part of your sarcasm to be justPleasure was the object of my pursuit and pleasure I obtained at the expence both of health and fortunebut yet my lord I broke not in upon the peace of others the laws of hospitality I never violated nor did I ever seek to injure or seduce the wife or daughter of my friend  Ld Eust  I care not what you did give me the letters  Fram  I have no right to keep and therefore shall surrender them tho' with the utmost reluctance but by our former friendship I intreat you not to open them  Ld Eust  That you have forfeited  Fram  Since it is not in my power to prevent your committing an error which you ought for ever to repent of I will not be a witness of itThere are the letters  Leaves them on the table  Ld Eust  You may perhaps have cause to repent your present conduct Mr Frampton as much as I do our past attachment  Fram  Rather than hold your friendship upon such terms I resign it for everFarewel my lord  Exit  Lord  EUSTACE  takes up the Letters  WILLIS  appears at the Side of the Scene  Wil  I am glad they have quarrelled I shall have my lord all to myself now  Aside  Ld Eust  I have been to blamebut yet 'twas cruel in him to distress me when he knows the difficulties of my situationhe has shocked me so extremely I find it impossible to touch the letters  Wil  Then we are all ruined and I shall never be paid for the carriage  Aside  Ld Eust  Yet if Langwood's letter should fall into their hands I must be undone  Wil  In order to strengthen his lordship's conscience I'll make my appearance  Aside  WILLIS  comes forward  Wil  I hope Mr Frampton has given your lordship the letters I took so much pains to get for youthere is one from Langwood to Mrs Winifred  Reenter Mr  FRAMPTON  The devil he here again there is no doing any business with these half gentlemen  Aside  Fram  My lord  Ld Eust  Mr FramptonLeave us Willis  Wil  So I have lost my labour  Aside  Exit  Fram  Ill treated as I have been my lord I find it impossible to leave you surrounded by difficulties  Ld Eust  That sentiment should have operated sooner Mr Framptonrecollection is seldom of use to our friends tho' it may sometimes be serviceable to ourselves  Fram  Take advantage of your own expression my lord and recollect yourselfBorn and educated as I have been a gentleman how have you injur'd  both yourself and me by admitting and uniting in the same confidence your rascal servant  Ld Eust  The exigency of my situation is a sufficient excuse to myself and ought to have been so to the man who  called  himself my friend  Fram  Have a care my lord of uttering the least doubt upon that subject for cou'd I think you once mean enough to suspect the sincerity of my attachment to you it must vanish at that instant  Ld Eust  The proofs of your regard have been rather painful of late Mr Frampton  Fram  When I see my friend upon the verge of a precipice is that a time for compliment Shall I not rudely rush forward and drag him from it Just in that state you are at present and I will strive to save youVirtue may languish in a noble heart and suffer her rival vice to usurp her power but baseness must not enter or she flies for everThe man who has forfeited his own esteem thinks all the world has the same consciousness and therefore is what he deserves to be a wretch  Ld Eust  Oh Frampton you have lodged a dagger in my heart  Fram  No my dear Eustace I have saved you from one from your own reproaches by preventing your being guilty of a meanness which you cou'd never have forgiven yourself  Ld Eust  Can you forgive me and be still my friend  Fram  As firmly as I have ever been my lord  Ld Eust  You are indeed my best my truest friend  embracing him  But yet I fear you will despise me FramptonYou never lov'd to that excess that I do and therefore cannot pardon the madness of that passion which wou'd destroy its dearest object  Fram  We must not judge of the strength of our passions by the miseries they bring on others but  rather by the means we use to save them from distressBut let us at present hasten to get rid of the mean business we are engaged in and forward the letters we have no right to detain  Ld Eust  Here take them do what you will with them I will be guided by youYet this affair of Langwood's letter  Fam  Will make dreadful confusion my lordLet me think a littleI have itSuppose we delay the delivery of it for a few days something may happen in that time that may save the unhappy Harriet the pain of such a discovery  Ld Eust  Tho' I have little hopes on that account yet wou'd I not precipitate her wretchedness it was to save her from it Frampton that first induced me  Fram  Talk nomore of it my lordMr Willis  Enter  WILLIS  Wil  So they are friends again I see  Aside  Did your honour call Mr Frampton  Fram  Take these letters and give them to Sir William's servant to be delivered immediately  Wil  What all of them my lord  Framp  No this one must be kept back Look it up carefully 'till I call for it  Ld Eust  Come my dear Frampton I have a thousand obligations to you and a thousand things to speak to you about  Ex Ld Eust Framp  Wil  My dear FramptonThere's a fellow for you that without half a crown in his pocket talks as much stuff about honour and such nonsense as if he were a dukeThey have not broke the seal I find that's Frampton's fault if he had not return'd the instant he did I wou'd have satisfied my lord's curiosity and my ownWell cannot I do so now A good servant shou'd prevent his master's  wishesMy lord I am sure would be glad to know the contents egad and so should I toobut how shall I come at 'emThis cursed seal  flirts it with his finger  Zounds what have I donewhat an accident why the letter's openwhy if it is one may read it without offenceSo by your leave good Mrs Winifred  reads  Madam as I am sensible the dreadful moment now approaches when I must render an account of all my actions  A steward's account will be tolerably long I suppose  Continues reading  I wish even by this late confession to atone for the crime I have been guilty of in aiding lord Eustace to impose upon your niece by a feigned marriage  The devil This is a confession indeed for which like all other meanspirited whimpering rascals he deserves to be hanged My lord was in the right to look sharp after this businessWe must have been blown up if it had come to light But as I hope to be well paid for the contents of this I may let the others go free  Exit  SCENE  changes to Sir William Evans's Apartment  HARRIET  seated on a Couch leaning on her Arm  Har  I cannot pierce thro' the mystery in which I am involved I strive in vain to recover my confidence in lord Eustace These fatal reports unhinge my very soulYet nothing can abate my love One false step has involved me in a thousand difficulties I can endure my situation no longer and let the consequence be what it may I will reveal the secret to my father But then my lord's intreaties and my aunt's commandswhy even they must be sacrificed to filial dutyWretch  that I am how did I dare to break that first of moral tiesHeavens he is here  Enter Sir  WILLIAM  with a Letter in his Hand  Sir Wm  I have just received a letter from your brother Harriet which I should have had ten days ago had I been at home  Har  Does he assign a cause for coming to London Sir  Sir Wm  Yes yes 'tis as Loyd guessed an affair of galantry but an honourable business tho'I long 'till ye are both married that I may hear no more of romances I hope when Harry has led the way you will have no objection to follow him  Har  What shall I say to him  Aside  Sir Wm  I wish I knew who my future daughterinlaw is to be Harry tells me she has a great fortune but that I suppose is a sweetenerBut if she has worth and virtue sufficient to make him happy I shal  be contentBut what's the matter Harriet I thought your illness was quit gone offyou look as if you had been weepingMy sister I suppose  Har  No Sir indeed her goodness to me as well as yours is graved upon my heart  Sir Wm  She is a very odd womanShe wou'd fain persuade me that I distressed you by jesting with captain Loyd about lord Eustace's mistressI begin to think that she is in love with him herselfOf what consequence are his galantries to her I dare say he has had a hundred of the same sort and that the lady to whom he is now going to offer his hand can have but a very small remnant of his heart  Har  I have heard him say Sir they should never be divided  Sir Wm  Fine talking for a libertine trulyHowever I agree with you that it is not right to  make a jest of those unfortunate women he may have ruinedAnd I commend your delicacy upon this occcasion as I well know it is the result of the most amiable female virtues modesty and compassion  Har  O Sir  Rises  Sir Wm  What ails

is connected with a libertine  Har  I hope Sir you have mistaken his character and when you know him better I am sure you will be sorry  Sir Wm  It is you child that I fear will have cause to be sorry for having mistaken his characteryoung women are but bad judges of their lovers morals  Har  My aunt Sir  Sir Wm  Aye aye she I suppose was privy to the match he is a lord and that's enough for her  I might have expected such a stroke from her intolerable vanityBut how have I been deceived in my opinion both of your duty and affection to me  Har  My future conduct Sir shall prove them both  Sir Wm  O Harriet What a disappointment is mine I hoped to have seen you united to a man of sense and worth who wou'd have respected as well as loved youInstead of that you are now joined to one who from his too intimate knowledge of the vicious part of your sex is likely to despise them all  Har  I flatter myself Sir that the goodness both of his heart and understanding will make him readily renounce any light errors he may have fallen into  Sir Wm  I wish it most sincerelybut  Har  Do not Sir injure him by doubting it  Sir Wm  I fear my child you flatter yourself in vain with any change in your husband's conductthat last amour which captain Loyd spoke of  Har  How blest am I to be able to acquit my lordTho' blushing I avow it it was his mysterious attachment to his wife that caus'd that vile reportO Sir let me again upon my knees entreat you to pardon what is past and give lord Eustace leave to prove the sincerity of his affection to me by his respectful tenderness and gratitude toward you  Sir Wm  Rise rise my Harriet Since it is soI forgive and bless you  Embraces her  Har  You have made your daughter happyhow will lord Eustace be transported  Sir Wm  Wou'd I cou'd see occasion for this joy  Aside  Retire my child compose your spirits and let me compose mineI wish to be alone  Har  It is almost impossible SirI am too too happy  Exit  Sir Wm  Why was this marriage huddled in the dark It shall not be kept secretMystery is the fit mask for vice my daughter needs it notI am impatient 'till I see lord Eustace  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  It is not long Sir since he went from hence  Sir Wm  No matter leave me Robert  Rob  If your honour wou'd hear a few words that I have to say  Sir Wm  I cannot hear you now my thoughts are all engaged  To himself  I must write to colonel Loyd directlyI shall have a sad piece of work with the old gentleman at Trevallinhe doats upon my girl as if she were his child  Rob  Aye Sir and so does every one who knows her except some of the folk in this houseI wish indeed I do that we were fairly out of it  Sir Wm  Well we shall leave it soonbut for the present Robert  Rob  Your honour little knows what's going forward in itsuch quarrelling such high words aye and such fine words too as I ne'er heard before tho' if I understand them right they have but a black meaning  Sir Wm  Robert we'll talk of this some other timeI say again I am not at leisure now  Rob  I can't be easy 'till I tell you Sir as I am sadly afraid there is something a plotting against your honour or my young mistressI have heard that wicked Willis talking of her to his fellow servantO Sir that fellow knows all his lord's secrets he is at the beginning and ending of all mischief and he says as how Miss Harriet has been only impos'd upon  Sir Wm starts  Yes Sir impos'd upon  and that his master will be married to a fine lady in less than a month's time  Sir Wm  How impos'd upon what can this mean lord Eustace dare not think of any thing so baseI injure both myself and him by the suspicion  Rob  All I know of the matter is Sir that the gentleman that lives here whom I believe to be a very honest man tho' Willis calls him a poor rogue and my lord Eustace had a sad quarrel and they talked so loud that I cou'd not help overhearing Mr Framptonfor I scorn to listenreproaching my lord with having behaved very ill both to you and your daughterbut they were friends afterwards and went out togetherBut Willis said a great deal more to James my lord's footman to the same senseand whatever mischief there is a brewing I am sure he knows all about it  Sir Wm  I cannot comprehend the meaning of all thisImposed uponI will be satisfiedHis scoundrel servant talk of my daughter and of his marriage with another ladyI have not patience to wait the meeting with lord EustaceIs that fellow in the houseThat Willis Robert  Rob  Yes Sir James and he have been taking a hearty glass I believe he looks pure and merry  Sir Wm  Bid him come to me directly  Rob  I am afraid he will be too cunning for your worship  Sir Wm  Do as I bid you  Rob  I will Sir  Exit Robert  Sir Wm  The happiness or misery of my child seem now suspended in an equal balanceLet my impatience to turn the scale in her favour excuse me to myself for condescending to inquire into another's secrets tho' they so nearly concern me  Enter  WILLIS  Wil  Your valet de chambre told me Sir that you desired to speak with me  Sir Wm  Our conversation will be but short Mr Willis  He shuts the door  Wil  I am in a rare humour to bam this Welsh Baronet  Aside  Sir Wm  I say our conversation will be but short Mr Willis but I shou'd wish it to be sincere  Wil  There he has hit the mark  Aside  O to be sure Sir I have been remarkable for truth and sincerity all my life Sir My mother taught me from a child never to tell a lie  Sir Wm  Truth is certainly the foundation of every other virtue and I hope I may depend upon yours to answer a few questions that I shall ask you  Wil  O yes you may depend upon meWhat the devil is he about He is certainly going to hear me my catechism  Aside  Sir Wm  I shall think myself obliged to you if you will acquaint me with what you know in relation to lord Eustace's marriage  Wil  Me Sir How is it possible I can tellAll's out I supposeO that cursed Langwood  Aside  Sir Wm  No trifling with me friend I will be answer'd  Wil  Yes to be sure Sir all servants ought to give civil answers to gentlemen but really Sir I cannot possibly tell you any thing about it  Sir Wm  Since fair means will not prevail upon you this shall extort the truth  Draws his sword  Wil  For heaven's sake Sir don't terrify an evidence in this land of libertyYou will either frighten what I do know out of my head or make  me confess any thing without knowing any thing at all of the matter  Sir Wm  No prevarication SirMen like you who are bred up in vice and idleness are to be influenced by nothing but their fearsTherefore tell me I say again what you know of this marriage  Wil  Yes yes they have had another letter from Langwood so I may as well make a merit of giving up ours since there can be none in keeping it from him  Aside  Sir Wm  What are you muttering villain Don't urge me farther I have lost my reason and will not answer for the consequences  Wil  I will do any thing Sir if you will be pleased to drop the point of that ugly piece of cold ironWhat you have heard from Langwood is most certainly trueBut a good servant you know Sir ought to keep his master's secrets till his life is in danger  Sir Wm  LangwoodMaster's secretsExplain yourself this moment  Wil  Dear Sir be patientWhat need you have the trouble of hearing it over again when you know it all already  Sir Wm  Dare you again insult me with your trifling  Wil  Why really Sir I can't say it was a right thing of my lord but none of his servants were in fault except Langwood we must do what our masters bid us and he poor devil is sorry enough as you know Sir and may see Sir  Takes the letter out of his pocket Sir William snatches it  Sir Wm  Langwood againWho is Langwood And what has he to do with your lord's marriage And what is this letter  Wil  It is for Mrs Winifred Sir and as to Langwood he was the mockdoctor the counterfeit parson that married my lord I was only the clerk indeed Sir and I hope your honour will be so good to forgive me and not leave all the sin and the shame too upon my poor conscience  Sir Wm  Why villain rascal what is all this stuff If your lord be married to my daughter how dare he think of any other wife  Wil  So I have made a fine piece of work on'tI find he did not know it was a sham marriage till now  Aside  Why really Sir you terrify me so that I don't rightly understand you I thought you knew all about it before I opened my lips to you  Sir Wm  I asked you wretch about your lord's intended marriage  Wil  O lord Sir it was very unlucky I did not understand you I shall be obliged to fly my country my lord will never let me live in England after this I shall lose an excellent place Sir  Sir Wm  Be gone thou profligate Fly from my sight this moment  Will  I am an undone scoundrel that's the truth of itBut this comes of muddling in a morningHad I been sober I shou'd have been an overmatch for his worship or any justice of peace in England I'll e'en retire till my master and this Welch family have so reconciled matters between themselves that a gentleman may be able to live with some satisfaction amongst them  Aside  Exit  Sir William reading the Letter  Sir Wm  What am I now to think My child is dishonoured Let me contain my rage a moment longer and be yet more fully satisfied from their own lipsRobert  Enter  ROBERT  Go call my sister andI cannot name her  Rob  Miss Harriet Sir  Sir Wm  Aye bid them come hither  Rob

a heavenly temper what can have happened to discompose you since but  Much Ado about Nothing  is your play from morning 'till night  Sir Wm  Read that  Gives her a letter  Mrs Win  A broken seal What can be the contents  Har  Dear Sir what is the matter  Sir Wm  Do not talk to me unhappy girl Lord Eustace has deceived youyou are not his wife  Har  All gracious heaven  Sinks upon a couch  Sir Wm  Rage and madness O women women what have ye done  Mrs Win  Vastly well I think  Sir Wm  Do not provoke me  Mrs Win  You are enough to provoke a saint yourselfWhat is all this stuff this letter this forgery this nonsense He personate a parson I  think I shou'd know a clergyman in any dress I am not quite so easily impos'd upon as you Sir William  Sir Wm  I will not answer youBut thou undutiful unhappy girl what can'st thou say  Mrs Win  I wish you wou'd hear reason and spare your reproaches Sir William  Har  Nogive them ventI only fear to live not dieLet loose your rage upon me I implore it I will endure it all  Sir Wm  You have deserved it Your own deceit has fallen upon your head you are betray'd dishonour'd and abandon'd both by your villain husband and your wretched father  Har  O Sir have pity on my anguish and despair  Sir Wm  I cannot bear your sightMy being life itself is hateful to me  To Mrs Win  This is your pride your rage for qualityYou have undone my child and I renounce you both  Exit  Har  Will you forsake me also  Mrs Win  Forsake you no child this is a perfect chimera of your father's  Har  O let us go this moment implore his goodness to forgive our fault and fly for ever from this hateful dwelling  Mrs Win  By no means I don't approve of your quitting your husband's house I wou'd have you write to him immediately and desire him to come to us this evening  Har  I write to him You make me shudder at the thought  Mrs Win  It must be done childI insist upon itThis is some trick meant to impose upon us  Har  I feel the imposition hereLord Eustace has betrayed us  Mrs Win  I tell you Harriet it is impossiblehe is at least the ninth peer of his family in a direct line  Har  Tho' honours may behonour is not hereditary madam  Mrs Win  No matter write to him I say you are and must be lady Eustace at any rate I tell you  Har  And can you think me vile enough after such perfidy to receive his hand Can I vow to honour the man whom I no longer esteem Shall I go to the altar with him and swear to be faithful to a perjur'd wretch again repeat my vows of everlasting love for him who has abandoned and undone me No I would sooner die a thousand thousand deaths  Mrs Win  You are just as obstinate as your fatherNow you have taken this into your head nothing can get it out again  Har  Do you think my father could be so inhuman without just grounds to stab me to the heart It is it is too true  Mrs Win  I will not believe a word of itI never was mistaken in my life my brother is ever in the wrongI desire Harriet you will write to lord Eustace directly  Har  Indeed I will not  Exit  Mrs Win  Then positively I willI am determin'd to know the truth from him I own I begin to be a little doubtful about this matter myself This letter may be forg'dbut those eternal reports confound me'Tis impossible he should dare to deceive mebut if he has he shall find that the Ap Evans's are not to be injured with impunity  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE  The Park  Enter Capt  LOYD  and Col  EVANS  Col  MY father in London you surprize me captainWhat can have brought him here  Capt  Nay as to the matter of surprize my young hero your father was quite as much astonish'd at hearing of your being in the same port as you can be and as to your aunt Winifred she started with as much amazement as the sailors that spied the first Patagonian Your sister indeed seem'd more pleas'd than any of them at the news and inquir'd whether I had met you in healthy condition and if I knew your moorings  Col  My gentle HarrietI am impatient to see her  Capt  Hoist sail and away then I'll be your convoy tho' I should like better to drop anchor and take in refreshment for an hour or so at the Admiralty Coffeehouse where I have appointed captain Blast of the Boreas and some other jolly lads to meet me  Col  I am much obliged to you captain but will by no means suffer you to break your engagementI have a little business to dispatch before I can see my father and shall easily find out the house without troubling you  Capt  Why that you may readily do as it is inclos'd by a very high wall and has a large handsome gateway with a bell at the doorAye  aye that bell was not plac'd there to call the crew to prayers but to prevent the neighbours from knowing who comes in and out as they might do if there was a rapper only  Col  I can't see why that caution should be necessary  Capt  It is of no great use at presentBut time has beenHarkee me Harry there is a devilish storm brewing over your head you may look for dirty weather I can tell youYour father is in a confounded passion at your having quitted the regiment and is strongly persuaded that you'll spring a leak my boy  Col  I wrote to my father some time ago to acquaint him with my motives I have also written to my colonel to account for my conduct  Capt  Never fear I'll take care of you as I am sure you did not desert from cowardiceBut it was a silly trick HarrySome girl I suppose is in the wind they make fools of the wisest of usI remember when I was station'd at Gibraltar a Donna Isabella  Col  Wou'd you were there now I know not how to get rid of this tiresome man  Aside  Capt  A Spaniard you may guess by the name had a devilish mind to come off with me as she said to see foreign partsBut I weigh'd anchor slily one moonlight night and left the poor signiora on shoreBut all men have not the gift of discretion tho' I was a younker then Harry not much turn'd of thirty I'll assure you  Col  I think it was rather cruel in you to forsake the lady captain  Capt  Why I did hear afterwards that there was a ballad made about it intitled  The Cruel Captain's Garland  and set to a very woeful tuneI  laugh at these things Harry but I find you are a truer lover and have come here in spite of wind and tide in pursuit of your mistressYou can't expect however that Sir William will be highly delighted if you shou'd happen to make a losing voyage of it  Col  I hope Sir it will be the most prosperous one of my life and I shall be able to give my father a satisfactory account of my conduct  Capt  Why if your mistress be well freighted a sixty thousand pounder or so he will have no objection I supposeBut come my boy tell me a little about it is she maid or widow Harry I like to hear lovestories mightily  Col  She is a maiden young and beautiful and of a rank and fortune beyond my expectation captain We have lov'd one another long her guardians are upon the point of disposing of her to another she has desir'd me to free her from their tyranny and accept of her hand as my rewardGlorious recompence  Capt  Why Harry this is running before the wind with a vengeanceNot so fast not so fast my boy you go at the rate of twelve knots an hourThis story sounds a little romantic tho' and puts me in mind of the lady that the flying man comes to save from the monsterBut 'tis odd enough that I shou'd not know this lady prithee Harry what's her name  Col  You must excuse my not answering that question captain as you might possibly become my rival  Capt  Why to be sure if she had applied to me she shou'd have been far enough from her guardians by this we'd have run gunnel to all the way my  boy and left them and you on the dry land Harry  Col  I shall tell her of your intended galantry captain and I hope you and she will be better acquaintedfor the present I must wish you a good evening  Capt  Nay if you have a mind to sheer off colonel I wish you a fair galeI never grapple with any thing but a pretty lass or an enemy and so your servant your servant colonel  Exit Capt  Col  My meeting with this blundering sailor was unlucky as my father may perhaps be displeas'd at my not waiting on him the moment I knew of his being in LondonBut I cannot break my engagement with lady Anneevery thing must give way to that charming womanI will fly to her directly and if possible find time to pay my duty to my father before I sleep  Exit  SCENE  Sir William's Apartment  Enter Mrs  WINIFRED  and  ROBERT  Mrs Win  He will come then you have staid a great while Robert  Rob  My lord was not at home madam and as you desir'd I shou'd bring an answer I was oblig'd to wait his comingEvery thing seems in confusion in the family his lordship it seems is to be married in a few days they are all packing up and the servants scarce knew where to find pen ink and paper  Mrs Win  This startles me'Tis but too plain I have been deceived  Aside  Hearken to me Robert and do exactly what I command yougo  and place yourself by the private door in the garden and the moment you hear a key turn in the lock come and tell me  Rob  I shall obey you madamI am sure all is not right  Aside  Exit  Mrs Win  I must if possible prevent Sir William's knowing of this interviewBut here he comes  Enter Sir  WILLIAM  I hope you have vented all your rage brother and that one may talk a little calmly to you now  Sir Wm  O yes I have great reason to be calm  Mrs Win  I can tell you that a little more of your outrageous fury wou'd have kill'd your daughter nor do I know what fatal effect it might have had upon my own constitution  Sir Wm  That is not very easily shock'd I believe  Mrs Win  That is more than you know at least brother but a person so intirely given up to their passions never once reflects upon consequences  Sir Wm  I wish you had reflected upon consequences but those who have err'd themselves are ever ready to reflect on others  Mrs Win  A truce with reflections on all sides and in case that there shou'd be any truth in this infamous story let us set about forming some scheme for redressing the affront that he has dar'd offer to our family  Sir Wm  I shall not stand in need of your assistance I am determin'd how to act  Mrs Win  Pray Sir William do not be headstrong but for once be advised by meI have thought of a scheme and I am sure it will answer  Sir Wm  What is it  Mrs Win  It is happy for my family that I have a little sense brother tho' I do not boast of it  Sir Wm  Your wisdom in this matter has been conspicuous but what new proofs of it are we to expect at present  Mrs Win  Suppose we were to send for lord Eustace and try what effect Harriet's tears and my reproaches wou'd have upon himHe has always had the greatest deference for my opinion  Sir Wm  Your opinionIs this your boasted schemeHe will not come base as he is it is impossible he cou'd endure her sight  Mrs Win  Your affected sagacity is enough to set one madYou are mistaken as you always are  Sir Wm  I know it cannot be the consciousness of his vile treachery will keep him far from henceHe dare not see her  Mrs Win  I cannot bear this contradiction  Aside  For once let conviction conquer your obstinacy I wrote to him myself in Harriet's name I have had his answer he will be here this night  Sir Wm  And shall my daughter sue to him for justice implore him to receive the hand he has rejected and the heart he has betray'd Shall she be sacrific'd to make his peace I tell you noI will have other vengeance  Mrs Win  I see these horrid punctilios will ruin allIf we can make up this matter quietly what does it signify whether he be a man of honor or no  Sir Wm  I never  ust forget that I am one  Mrs Win  I wish you wou'd have a little patience and hear me outIf this should fail I have another project in my head which I am certain must succeedMy imagination has not been idle and I think it full as active as your own  Sir Wm  I believe it may be rather more soBut I have no leisure for imaginary matters now  Going  Mrs Win  Pray Sir William don't be so positiveyou know lord Eustace has a place at court  Sir Wm  What then  Mrs Win  I wou'd at least let the king know what a servant he has about him and as I may reasonably suppose that his majesty may have heard of our ancestors tho' he knows nothing of you Sir William I wou'd advise you to throw yourself at his feetHe is himself a father  Sir Wm  Blest may he long be in that honour'd title tho' I am render'd wretched by the nameBut what can he do for me  Mrs Win  Disgrace and displace the man who has wrong'd you altho' he be a lord  Sir Wm  What is his title has he not debas'd itBut know there is no difference of rank before the thronedegrees of elevation are only seen by those who look above them kings must look down and therefore see all equal and in our monarch's sight the rights even of the meanest subject are precious as his ownBut yet he cannot heal my wrongs  Mrs Win  Tho' I can never believe that a knight baronet is upon a par with a lord Sir William  Sir Wm  Absurd distinctions I will hear no moreThe man who has the means of justice in his own hands and seeks for it elsewhere deserves to be the sport of chance and dupe of his own weaknessThen let him come this nightI'll meet him as I ought  Mrs Win  You are exactly in the same case of the Dissidents at Warsaw nothing but force of arms will content you and like them too you may be  undone by itSuppose you were to meet lord Eustace and he shou'd kill you  Sir Wm  I shall not then outlive my honor  Exit  Mrs Win  This selfwill'd man distresses me extremelyhe is for ever disconcerting my schemesThere never was such a race of ideots as the family of the Ap Evans's myself exceptedthere is not a head in this house but my ownTo be sure I have been a little overreach'd in this affair of the wedding but the greatest politicians are liable to mistakesI hope to repair all yet and make my niece a woman of quality one way or another  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  Madam I have just now heard the private door of the garden unlock and ran to tell you  Mrs Win  Vanish  Exit Rob  I must not let my brother and lord Eustace meet 'till every thing is settled  Exit  SCENE  Garden Parlour  Enter Lord  EUSTACE  and Col  EVANS  with their Swords in their Hands Lord  EUSTACE  lays his on a Chair  Ld Eust  You are here in safety Sir and may put up your sword this house is mine notwithstanding the mysterious manner of my entranceI hope you are not wounded  Col  Thanks to your courage and generosity Sir I have escaped unhurt I thought our police was better conducted than to suffer our lives to be endangered by footpads  Ld Eust  These accidents are less frequent in this country than they used to be but no code of laws was ever yet framed that cou'd make all men honestI am extremely happy at having come so opportunely to your assistance  Col  I shall ever be grateful for the obligation Sir but may I not know to whom I am obliged  Ld Eust  Do not mention the matter as a favour I intreat youYou wou'd doubtless have done the same for me and had I happen'd to have come first I shou'd have stood in need of your assistanceI am call'd lord Eustace  Col  I shall remain indebted to your lordship and wish you a good nightWhat a rencontre  Aside  Ld Eust  I could wish you not to leave me Sir 'tis late and therefore unsafe for either of us to return aloneThe fellows who attacked you may lye in wait for youI shall not stay here a quarter of an hour and as I wish to be better acquainted with you I shou'd be glad to know your address  Col  I am extremely obliged to your lordship I am call'd colonel Weston you'll hear of me at the hotel in Pallmall  Going  Ld Eust  Let me entreat you not to leave meI am at present in a very difficult and disagreeable situation  Col  Your lordship has a right to command me but I hope you will not stay longer than the time you have mention'd as I have some business to transact this night  Ld Eust  If that be the case I will not trespass upon you perhaps there may be something similar in our circumstances for your business at this hour must in all probability be with a lady and you may reasonably suppose by my being alone and on foot that I am come to meet one here  Col  Let me entreat your lordship not to lose such precious minutes but fly to the expecting fair oneThis is an odd discovery  Aside  Ld Eust  The matter is not as you imagine Sir  Col  There is perhaps a jealous husband or an old cross father my lord  Ld Eust  Neither colonel But matches made for interest only too often break the most delightful ties the union of fond heartsThe lady who lives here is the most amiable of her sex and I adore her yet am on the point of marrying one whom I can never love  Col  This is a sad affair indeed my lordI cou'd save you a great deal of trouble if I were at liberty to tell you lady Anne's intentions  Aside  Ld Eust  I fear the unhappy girl has heard of my intended marriage as she has written to me to come here this nightI never was so embarras'd or distress'd  Col  Some girl you keep I presume my lord  Ld Eust  By no means she is a woman of family and characterI am almost distracted about herI will now step and see if the coast be clear as there are some of the family that I shou'd not chuse to encounter at this late hour and return to you Sir instantlyYou see what confidence you have already inspired me with  Exit  Col  A confidence indeed but of what use can it be to me who am bound in honor not to betray it  Looks at his watch  Bless me it is now past eleventhe time I spent with lady Anne stole unperceived away It will certainly be too late to go to my father's tonight I must defer my visit 'till tomorrow and as lord Eustace don't seem in a great hurry to be married I shall have time enough to get lady Anne out of her guardian's power and  prepare my father for her receptionBut here comes my new friend  Reenter Lord  EUSTACE  Ld Eust  All is quiet I must therefore take the opportunity of conveying you safe out again and I hope to have the pleasure of being better known to you  Col  Your lordship's inclination does me honor  Exeunt  SCENE  Another Apartment  Enter Mrs  WINIFRED  leading  HARRIET  Mrs Win  Your obstinacy is enough to distract meI say you shall see him  Enter Lord  EUSTACE  Har  Support me gracious Heav'n  Ld Eust  My dearest Harriet your billet has alarm'd me more than I can expressI have made the utmost dispatch that was possible to fly to you and the moments that have passed since I received your commands have been the most painful of my life  Mrs Win  Your lordship need not enter into a defence of your punctuality  Ld Eust  Why is my Harriet's brow overcast and her eyes quenched in tears Why is she silent  Mrs Win  Ask your own heart  Ld Eust  Is it possible that the idle report of my marriage can have distress'd her thus  Har  Horrid dissembler  Aside  Mrs Win  Do not exhaust your spirits my dear Harriet give me leave to talk to him  Aside to Harriet  So then my lord what we have heard upon the subject is but an idle report without the least foundation  Ld Eust  If you will but recollect what has pass'd between your niece and me madam you must be fully convinced it can be nothing more  Mrs Win  And yet my lord you seem confused  Ld Eust  Why really madam the doubts you seem to entertain of my veracity are a little distressingBut let me hope my Harriet will believe me while I swear  Har  Away my lord I can believe no moreCou'd I have thought that either my wrongs or my resentment were capable of increase  Ld Eust  Really madam I do not clearly understand the meaning of this conversationand I must say I think it rather severe to be condemn'd unheard  Mrs Win  I can contain my rage no longer read that  Gives him Langwood's letter  Ld Eust  Langwood's letter All is discover'd then  Aside  Mrs Win  I perceive that even a man of quality may be disconcertedYour lordship did not use to be at a loss for an answer  Ld Eust  Have patience madam I confess that appearances are against me  Mrs Win  Aye and realities too my lord  Ld Eust  I do not mean to justify myselfNo I plead guilty The fear of losing you my Harriet whom I lov'd more than life and the apprehension of disobliging my father tempted me to  make you mine in an illegal mannerBut here I swear I will repair the injury  Mrs Win  I think it will do matters are in a right train now if I can but prevent Sir William from interrupting them  Aside  Exit  Ld Eust  You are offended Harriet and have causebut let not your resentment turn against yourself  Har  Cou'd I forgive myself my lord I then might pardon you but while I think my punishment severe I own I have deserved it  Ld Eust  You judge yourself too hardlyHas either your virtue or your delicacy suffered by my crime Nay even your reputation is still free from stain and if you will now condescend to accept my hand my future life shall be devoted to your happiness  Har  And can you think I'll be again deceived  Ld Eust  By heaven you shall not  Har  Nay I will notYour poor evasions have no weight with meLeave me for ever leave meI will not be united to you by any ties  Going  Ld Eust  Yet hear me Harriet  Har  Wou'd I had never heard youBut tho' I were to listen to you now you cannot shake my purpose NoI can die  Exit  Ld Eust  No live my Harriet Live to make me happy  Sir  WILLIAM  within  Sir Wm  Where is he I must and will see him  Ld Eust  Ah Sir William This is unlucky I am not prepar'd for this encounter  Aside  Enter Sir  WILLIAM  Sir Wm  What is it possible that you shou'd dare to enter underneath this roof  Ld Eust  What shou'd I fear Sir William  Sir Wm  Your own base heart and my much injur'd honour which calls upon you now for justice  Ld Eust  So then I find the pride of injur'd virtue was assumedYour daughter would secure me by compulsionBut I despise assassins  Sir Wm  Do not my lord insult my patience farther I did not know you were without a sword on that account I put up mine but know young man I shall not rest till it has done me justice  Ld Eust  Sir William tho' I cannot pretend to justify the injuries I have done your daughter I neither must nor will be compell'd to make the reparation I shou'd indeed be unworthy to become her husband if fear cou'd make me so  Sir Wm  At the first hour you saw her Sir I shou'd have deemed you so'Tis not your birth young man can varnish over vices such as yoursYour rank renders them the more obnoxious  Ld Eust  I readily allow myself to blame Sir William  Sir Wm  You cannot then be base enough to refuse the sole atonement which is now within your power  Ld Eust  I will confess I felt my heart fubdued by Harriet's grief and tendernessthey had more power than armiesShe might have triumphed over me but  Sir Wm  You surely do not think I mean to give my daughter to you What to reward your vices with a heart like hersto have my child become a second time a sacrisice to that vain idol TitleNo Sir it is another kind of reparation I demand and I will have it  Ld Eust  A brave man Sir William never thinks meanly of another's courage and as I know you to  be so I hope you will not think me otherwise if I decline your offer  Sir Wm  On what pretence my lord Have you not wrong'd me  Ld Eust  For that reason only I cannot dare not draw my sword against you  Sir Wm  These are new rules of honour form'd on the principles of fear my lord  Ld Eust  Fear Sir William  Sir Wm  Yes my lord I say it none but a coward ever will decline to meet the man he has injured and shou'd you still persist in your refusal I will proclaim you one  Ld Eust  This is too muchBut consider Sir you aremy Harriet's father  Sir Wm  That consideration wou'd brace a nerveless armBut look upon me Sir I am not bent beneath the weight of yearsmy mind and body both are firm as yours and the first shock that ever reach'd my heart except her mother's loss is the disgrace you have brought upon my childThe stain must be effac'd my lord  Ld Eust  I know not how to act shou'd I declare my intention to marry Harriet he wou'd despise me and if I fight him that renders it impossible  Aside  Sir Wm  Come come my lord this is no time for musingYou must determine instantly to give me the satisfaction I require or see your title posted up with the honourable addition of coward to it  Ld Eust  Nay then Sir William tho' with reluctance I must accept your offerName your time Sir  Sir Wm  At eight tomorrow morning  Ld Eust  I'll call upon you Sir and bring a friendBut let me once more add that you are the  only man on earth that I shou'd fear to meet upon such termsâ–ª  Exit  Sir Wm  I am glad my son is ignorant of this affairHad he been here he must have fought lord EustaceHe has I hope a long and happy life before him mine tho' not quite worn out is of less value and if I lose it in defence of my child's honour 'tis well disposed of  Enter Mrs  WINIFRED  Mrs Win  So she was or might have been very well dispos'd of but for your intemperanceYou have managed your matters very cleverly to be sureYou have driven lord Eustace away and the family of the Ap Evans's are disgrac'd for ever  Sir Wm  Thou weak vain woman whose folly has undone me and my child  Mrs Win  Not I truly Sir WilliamIt is her own highflown principles that have ruined herMy lord offered to marry her over and over again it seems but she with her nonsensical romantical notions affected to despise him and refused to be his wife on any terms  Sir Wm  Has she I rejoice to hear it  Mrs Win  Rejoice at what at her being a mad woman I think in her situation she needed not have been so niceIt would have been much better for her to have been lady Eustace even against his will than Miss Harriet Evans's against her own  Sir Wm  How nearly pride and meanness are allied You wou'd obtrude your niece upon a man who has abandoned and dishonour'd her then vainly think she might receive distinction from a title which force not choice bestowed  Mrs Win  Brother I neither understand logic nor sophistry but I am very sorry matters are as they are  As to Harriet I believe it will be of no great consequence to her she will soon break her heart I imagineBut the scandal of this affair will rest upon the survivorsI don't think I shall ever be able to shew my face at Monmouth again  Sir Wm  Away The moments now are too precious to be wasted Where is Harriet  Mrs Win  In her chamber like a distracted wretch tearing herself to pieces I endeavoured to comfort her as much as I could by telling her how wrong she had acted and that she might have lived to be a countess if he had followed my advice  Sir Wm  Was this the consolation you offer'd to her grief How cou'd you be so barbarous The proper spirit she has shewn in refusing that worthless lord has replaced her in my heartI will go try to comfort her  Exit  Mrs Win  Aye so you may you are the fittest to go together For my part I disclaim the mismanagment of this whole affair and remember I'll no longer be accountable for measures that I am not suffer'd to guide  Exit  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE  Mr Frampton's Apartment  Ld  EUSTACE  and Mr  FRAMPTON  discovered  Lord Eustace rises from a Table as if writing  Fram  YOUR meeting with Sir William was extremely unfortunate  Ld Eust  I most sincerely wish we had not met but that is past  Fram  Then I suppose you think the worst is over  Ld Eust  No Frampton 'tis to comeSir William has insisted upon my meeting him this morning  Fram  Impossible my lord you must not fight him Think on the consequences if you should be so unhappy as to kill the father of the woman you have highly injured the world wou'd certainly unite against you and drive you from society  Ld Eust  In that case I shou'd be but ill qualified for solitude I confessNow my dear Frampton as I know you are my friend and as I wou'd not wish any other person shou'd be acquainted with this story I must desire you will be my second  Fram  It is much beneath a man of honour to make professions either of his friendship or his courage but on this occasion I must tell you that I wou'd hazard my life for your service in any other cause but I will not be concern'd in this  infamous affair and I say again you must not raise your arm against Sir William  Ld Eust  You do not know how I am circumstanced He has compell'd me to this duel said he wou'd brand me for a coward if I declin'd itWhat wou'd you have me do  Fram  Marry his daughter  Ld Eust  NoTho' I love her with the truest fondness I will not wed her upon such terms nor suffer her to think so meanly of me as to suppose I poorly barter'd a coward's hand to save his worthless life  Fram  Yet consider my lord that let the consequences of this duel be what they may nothing can acquit you of that justice you owe both to her and yourself  Ld Eust  I own that I have greatly wrong'd her  Fram  It is now within your power to make reparation by becoming her husband but shou'd you deprive her of a father she never can be united to the man who kill'd him  Ld Eust  I will not kill him FramptonUrge me no fartherMy mind is torn to pieces  Fram  Believe me my lord you are not in a right course to heal it  Ld Eust  No matter you have refus'd to be a witness of my conduct Mr Frampton  Fram  And do so still I never had the least reason to doubt your bravery and as this is an affair in which only principals can be concern'd I hope it will be no imputation upon mine if I decline seeing your lordship engaged in a strife where I cannot wish you success  Ld Eust  I shall not press you but have yet a request to make  Fram  Name it my lord  Ld Eust  If I should fall deliver this letter to my father andif there be any circumstance of my misconduct left untold which may do Harriet justice inform him of it fullyI must now go seek for a less cautious friend than Mr Frampton  Fram  Your lordship will scarcely ever find a sincerer  Exit lord Eustace  Of what opposite qualities is this young man compounded What a mixture of good and evil But are we not all made of the same materials The devil himself cannot always mislead a man that has principles they will recur in spite of him and make their owner act rightly upon trying occasionsThis letter to his father shews him to be a man of honorSomething must be done to preserve himI cannot give him upAn experiment tho' a hazardous one must be made directly  Exit  SCENE  Sir William's Apartment  Enter  HARRIET  and Mrs  WINIFRED  Har  When shall my tortured mind find rest Gracious heaven preserve me from distraction Perhaps in a few moments my father's sword may pierce my husband's heartWhy has that tender name escap'd my lips Resentment should have stopt its passage to my tongue and sighs opposed its utterance  Mrs Win  I don't see any harm child in your calling him your husband tho' to be sure he is not so in lawBut I wou'd have you hope the best Harriet  Har  No I will hope no moreWhat shou'd I hopeMy pride my reason might have scorn'd him living but I will love him and lament him  deadWou'd I had died the hour before I listen'd to your counsel and set at nought the authority of my fatherYour cruel kindness has undone me  Mrs Win  I shou'd not have thought of meeting such a return for that kindness from you Miss Evans  Har  Forgive and pity my distraction madam 'Tis I that have brought ruin on ye allBut if you ever loved me think of some means to find my brother out he may prevent this duel and save me from the lowest depth of misery  Mrs Win  Really child you are extremely ignorant you talk as if you were at Mohmouth where our family are known and properly respectedbut in such a place as London it may possibly be as difficult to find out an Ap Evans as any of those mushroom gentry whose  Table  does not contain above three generations  Har  My dearest aunt do not place bars before my only hope let all our servants be sent out to seek him  Mrs Win  Well child if it will make you easy they shall go directly tho' I am of opinion it will be but a fruitless inquiry But the being too easily prevail'd upon is my greatest foibleI wish I had a little of Sir William's obstinacy about me  Har  Consider madam I am on the rack do not lose time I beg of you  Mrs Win  Well be composed I will send them they shall search all the genteel coffeehouses at the West end of the townit is impossible he shou'd be in the cityBut don't let your father know that I told you of the duel he thinks women are never to be trusted with any thing and has no  more respect for the empressqueen or the czarina that I have for a county justice  Exit Mrs Winifred  Har  How can she be insensible to griefs like mine  Enter Sir  WILLIAM  Sir Wm  What up so early Harriet Who has disturbed your rest  Har  O Sir where is that powerful opiate to be found that can restore it  Sir Wm  The consciousness of your own heart and my forgiveness of your only fault shou'd set your mind at peace  Har  What while that fault endangers your dear life and robs my brother of the best of fathersunworthy as I am to call you by that name  Sir Wm  Her grief almost unmans me  Aside  Why are you agitated thus  Har  O do not make my brother hate me tooWill he not call me parricideor if  Sir Wm  Who has acquainted you with this affair I did not think there was a heart so brutalBut do not Harriet thus alarm yourselfall may be yet repaired  Har  Never Sir never for here I vow that shou'd lord Eustace arm his hand against your life no power on earth shall ever make me his  Sir Wm  Harriet the laws of  honour  must be satisfied and when I was first blest with the fond name of father  yours  then became my most peculiar care nor life nor aught on earth is half so dear to meNay Harriet do not weep I blame you not your youth and innocence have been deceiv'd  Har  You are too good too gentle to me Sir I have deserv'd all the distress I feelYet hear me  SirIf this must bemight not my brother Sir dear as he is to me  Sir Wm  My determination cannot now be alter'd retire my child  Enter  ROBERT  Rob  Captain Loyd Sir desires to see your honor  Sir Wm  Shew him up  Exit Robert  Har  Oh Sir  Sir Wm  Leave me my Harriet leave me  Embraces her  Har  My father  Exit Harriet  Sir Wm  My heart bleeds for her  Enter Captain  LOYD  Capt  I have crouded all the sail I cou'd make to come up with you baronet and now that I am here I should be glad to know in what soundings we are and whether we are to steer starboard or larboard  Sir Wm  My letter I believe captain must have given you to understand the reason of my desiring to see you at present I am unhappily engaged in a duel and the opinion I have both of your bravery and friendship made me look upon you as the properest person of my acquaintance to be my second  Capt  As to that matter Sir William I think I have discharged as many broadsides as any gentleman in the navytho' I never yet drew a trigger out of the line but powder and ball I suppose do pretty much the same execution by land as by sea tho' standing fair to the windward is sometimes of great use to us baronet  Sir Wm  It is of little consequence which way the wind sits at present captain  Capt  I can't say much to that Sir WilliamBut I wish you had acquainted me with this business a day or two ago I shou'd have lik'd to have made a little willBut 'tis no great matter neitherFor if I should pop over you daughter's husband will be my heir  Sir Wm  There is not the least occasion for that precaution captain as your life will not be endanger'd  Capt  How so When the ship is once engaged must not every man aboard her fight All but the chaplain and he shou'd be busy in his way too  Sir Wm  In this case my friend you need be no farther concern'd than to see that the laws of honor are not violated  Capt  Hold hold Sir William this may do for some of your fresh water sparks but Jerry Loyd will never lie to when the signal's given for chaceno lugsail work for me I shall come pouring down upon themBut pray who is your antagonist And what is the cause of your quarrel Was it a drunken businessI was pretty jolly myself last night but don't remember that I had words with any one except the waiter  Sir Wm  I shou'd be asham'd captain were I weak enough to run into one vice from the consequences of another or hazard my life this day for having been guilty of excess last night  Capt  Well if that is not the case I don't know what it is For I think you are not quarrelsome when you are soberBut have you breakfasted Tho' you may have no great appetite my stomach has been ready for a mess this half hour I can tell you  Sir Wm  We shall find every thing prepar'd in the next room  Capt  Let us make to the storeroom directly and while we are laying in our provisions you may tell me who is your man and all about it  Exeunt  Enter Lord  EUSTACE  Colonel  EVANS  and a Servant  Ld Eust  Let your master know that I am here  Col  This is the most romantic affair my lord that ever I heard of To set out determined to stand your enemy's fire without returning it  Ld Eust  The wrongs I have done him and his family shou'd be atoned and not increased colonel and were it now within my power I wou'd not take his life even to save my own  Col  There I think you are right my lord but I can't say I shou'd carrymy politeness so far as to make him a compliment of mine  Ld Eust  There is something much higher than politeness in the question at presentjustice colonelA man may dispense with the one but not the other  Col  I am intirely of your opinion but as your sentiments are so very delicate and that you really love the girl why may not I as your second step in and save the explosion of gunpowder and the lady's character by preventing the duel  Ld Eust  I will not suffer it  Col  As you intend to offer her your hand when this business is over I don't see why you shou'd run the hazard of losing life or limb and if the father be a man of honor as you say he is I shou'd think  Harriet behind the Scenes  Har  I will not be restrained No I will rush between their cruel swords  Enter at the same Instant at opposite Doors Sir  WILLIAM  and  HARRIET  Har  My brother here then heaven has heard my prayer  Sir Wm  My son  Col  My father  Har  Will you not speak to me  To the Col who turns from her  Ld Eust  Are you her brother  Col  Yes I have that dishonourIll fated girl  Sir Wm  What can this mean Are you come hither to abet the man who has disgraced your sister  Col  My father can't suppose it  Sir Wm  Retire this moment then and take her with youMy lord I am ready to attend you singly  Har  You shall not go for I will cling for ever here  Falls at Sir William's feet  Ld Eust  I cannot bear this sightPray hear me Sir  Sir Wm  Take her away  To the Col  This is no time for expostulationCome my lord  To Ld Eustace  Col  Nay then Sir I must interfereI cannot suffer you to turn assassin even for herLord Eustace has not charg'd his pistols nor does he mean to raise his arm against youYou cannot take his life upon these terms  Sir Wm  Does he despise me then  Har  A little gleam of hope breaks in upon me  Aside  Ld Eust  Your son can answer that Sir William  Col  With truth my lord I say you do notNow you must answer me  To lord Eustace  Ld Eust  Your being perfectly acquainted with my intentions towards your sister before I knew that you were related to her shou'd I think be a sufficient answer to any demand you can possibly have to make  Col  By no means my lord tho' your tenderness for the weakness you have caused may incline you to repair her lost honor I must and will be guardian of my own and nothing but your meeting me on fair and equal terms can heal the wound you have given it  Sir Wm  Now Harry you are my son  Har  Inhuman brother will nothing but his life content your rage Let me die for him  Ld Eust  My angel HarrietBut since it must be so I am ready colonel  Aside  Col  I hope your lordship thinks I stand acquitted of my obligations to you by preventing your engaging on such unequal terms for that unworthy girl  Ld Eust  You wrong her much it is I alone am guilty  Sir Wm  It is true my son Harriet is innocent  Col  If that be true I have a double right to vengeance  Ld Eust  You have a right to chuse your reparation Sir and I attend you  Har  When shall my miseries end  As Lord  EUSTACE  and Col  EVANS  are going off Enter Mr  FRAMPTON  Framp  I hope this moment madam  Sir Wil  What can this mean  Ld Eust  Frampton  Framp  I have no sort of business with your lordship  my commission is directed to Sir William Evans and lady Eustace  Har  Do not insult me Sir I am not lady Eustace  Sir Wm  Nor ever shall be  Framp  That is a point that will not I think admit of being contested  Col  You are mistaken Sir but this is trifling  Ld Eust  I am on the rackexplain yourself my friend  Framp  You must give me leave to speak thenWhen I saw the distress and anxiety of your mind I was fully satisfied of your honourable intentions towards this lady from the letter you entrusted me with which yet remains unopenedI determin'd if possible to preserve both your life and honour for her sake by preventing your duel with her father and your marriage with lady Anne Mountfort  Col  The first event Sir has been prevented without your assistance and I will venture to promise that the second shall never take place  Framp  I am quite of your opinion Sir As I came this moment from lord Delville to acknowledge this fair lady as his son's wifebut this letter Sir William will more fully explain his lordship's sentiments  Ld Eust  My generous friend my guardian angel  Framp  My lord I neither desire nor deserve your thanksIf I have been in any way serviceable to you attribute it to my real attachment to your truly amiable wife  Col  I do not understand all this  Enter Mrs  WINIFRED  Mrs Win  'Tis as I guess'd exactlyAll smoke and no fireMy nephew here Then something may be doneI rejoice to see you Harry  Sir Wm  Lord Delville has behav'd like a man of honour but yet I must inform you Sir that the generosity of his conduct cannot efface the baseness of his sonMy daughter shall never be his wifeHe has disgrac'd her  To Frampton  Ld Eust  Never Sir Here is my witnessthis letter which I now entreat my Harriet to peruse will fully prove that had I fallen by your hand her honour wou'd have been preserv'd  Har  I will not read it  Mrs Win  I think that was behaving like a man of quality  Fram  Let me entreat you Sir William to look it over as I can with truth and honour attest the sincerity of the writer  Col  There need no farther vouchers Let Harriet now determine for herself  Har  The struggle is too greatI cannot speakLeave me my lord  Ld Eust  Never whilst I have life will I forsake you  Har  It cannot be my lordTho' I have the highest sense of gratitude for lord Delville's goodness to me and tho' I believe you perfectly sincere in what you say at present yet the humiliating situation into which you have plunged me the distress you have brought upon my family your attachment to another lady  Ld Eust  With shame I must confess my trifling with a lady whom I cou'd not have lov'd even had my Harriet been unknown to me  Col  I think I may venture to assure your lordship that lady Anne Mountfort will be very ready to forgive your want of passion for her as her partiality for me might perhaps have been the cause of her blindness to your superior merits  Ld Eust  I congratulate your good fortune colonel and am indebted to your generosity for removing every shadow of difficulty on lady Anne's account  Mrs Win  Nephew I wish you joyThere will be one wom of quality at least in the family  Har  Weak as I am my lord you cannot shake my resolution  Ld Eust  I have no hope but in your interposition Sir you are her father and have been most offended yet you perhaps have the goodness to forgive  To Sir William  Sir Wm  Aye and give too my lord the man who sincerely repents of error is farther remov'd from vice than one who has ne'er been guiltyThis letter is a sufficient and convincing proof of your contrition Take her she is and shall be yours  Ld Eust  My wife  Embracing her  Har  The commands of a father must not be resistedO my lord how different are my present sensations from those I sustained when I ventur'd to bestow this hand without his sanctionBut take it it is yours for ever now  Ld Eust  Then every wish of my fond heart is accomplished  Col  Joy to your lordship and my dearest Harriet  Fram  I sincerely wish your ladyship all the happiness which I well know you have deserv'd  Ld Eust  And you my friend shall share it with us who have steer'd my course to this blest harbour thro' all the shoals and quicksands of my folly  You shall be happy too if ought within my fortune or my power can render you so  Fram  Continue to preserve your present bliss my lord and I am overpaid  Mrs Win  I think I have a right to partake in your ladyship's felicity from the principal share I have had in bringing this event to pass I hope that lord Delville has been properly inform'd  Enter Captain  LOYD  That man is my perpetual torment  Capt  Why heyday Sir William What wind's a blowing now You seem to have cast anchor when I thought you were putting out to seaHere is the whole crew assembled Miss Winifred and allDo women fight duels If I had them on board the Dreadnought I'd clap them all under hatches before she engagedBut come along baronet you don't mean to slack sail now I hopeI thought by this time we shou'd have made a few eyelet holes in the enemy's rigging  Sir Wm  I hope my good friend you will excuse my seeming inattention to your impatient bravery when I tell you that our contest has ended happily and that you may now wish all this company as well as lord Eustace joy  Capt  He is to be married then it seemsI hope madam you'll believe me another time  To Mrs Winifred  Mrs Win  Yes when you tell truth captainBut at present you happen to be a little out in your soundings for the ship's name is not the lady Anne but the lovely HarrietThe country girl you talked of  Capt  Well well all is one to meSo she is bound for the port of matrimony I am content  and so I wish your lordship your ladyship and all your ships a prosperous voyage to the island of happiness  Sir William  They promise fair to reach that wish'dfor port  For virtue tho' of winds and waves the sport  By passions shaken and by danger crost  On life's great sea is never wholly lost  Some power divine

If sentimental nonsense thrown aside  To cards and politics she had applied  For common cares her soul had been too great  And only felt an ardor for the state  Had glow'd alone with freedom's glorious flame  And next to PAM's had honour'd PAOLI's name  Twice in our annals baffled France and Spain  Have wept the glories of a female reign  With great success I think we now might try  The
