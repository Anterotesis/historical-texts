LONDON Printed for T WARNER at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow    THE PREFACE  _IT may seem strange to publish any thing of this kind after a New  Dispensatory  that has drawn together all that is valuable in  Medicine  but this  Manual  is ventured into the World notwithstanding such Disadvantage because it contains the Prescriptions of the most eminent Physicians in our Nation which were contrived on purpose for the Poorer Sort of People and are at present constantly used in the  Hospitals  of  London  And therefore it is a Collection of the  most  cheap  and most  efficacious Medicines  that the whole Art does supply  To render it the more Useful here are annexed to every Prescription Explanations of their Virtues and Uses after the Manner of Dr  QUINCY  in his New  Dispensatory    The  Physicians  whose Names this bears in the  Title  it is hoped will not in the least take it amiss that what they have been at the Pains to contrive for the Use of those particularly under their Care is in this manner made more extensive for a Common Good  Pharmacopoeia Pauperum OR THE HOSPITAL DISPENSATORY  _THE Waters most commonly in Use in the publick Hospitals are the  Aqua Lactis Alex  Cerasor Nigr  Cinnam sort  Hord  Menthae  Pulegii  Rutae  Epidemiae  Bryoniae Comp  Stephani  Theriacalis  And all made exactly as directed by the  London Dispensatory  and used for the same Purposes  Aqua Antiphthisica  ℞ Fol Symphit Maj  Polygonat  Plantag  Pimpinel ā M  iv  Rad Liquorit  ℥ij  Infundantur frigide  ℘  Dies in Aq Calcis Cong  ij  A Water against Consumptions  Take Leaves of Comfrey the Greater  Solomon  's Seal Plantane and Pimpinel each Hands full LiquoriceRoot Ounces infuse them cold for Days in Gallons of Limewater  This is very easily made and is much better than if it were to be distilled It is of excellent Use in such Consumptions as proceed from a sharp thin Blood especially in those who have been injured by a Venereal Taint or have any Hereditary Remains of scrophulous or leprous Humours It is ordered to be drank for some time together the Quantity of a Quart or two in a Day It is also directed to wash foul Ulcers and does good Service in such Cases  Aqua Liberans  ℞ Rassur Lig Sassafr sine Cortice  ℥ij  Lig Guiac cum Cortice  ℥j  Rad Glycyrrh  ℥iij  Sem Coriand cont  ʒvj  Infund frigidè in Aq Calcis Cong  j ℘  aut    Dies    Take of the Shavings of Sassafras without the Bark Ounces of Guiacum with the Bark Ounce LiquoriceRoot Ounces CorianderSeeds bruised Drams infuse them cold in one Gallon of Limewater for or Days  This is yet more drying than the former and is therefore good in all Cases that require Absorbents and Sweetners especially in all Venereal Affections after Salivation It will assist much likewise in the Itch and all Foulnesses which lodge upon the Skin It may be drank at Discretion and ought to be used for some time together  Aqua Limacum  D  M  ℞ Limac Hortens depur contus Cong  vj

of Hours and then draw it off in a common Alembick  This is admirably well contrived both for Cheapness and Efficacy and for Persons whose Circumstances and Manner of living have not habituated them to any Delicacies it is as good a Snailwater as can be made and with the two former are the chief that are used in the Hospitals And as they are mostly given in Consumptions contracted from vicious Practices and Venereal Contagions this is the constant Drink of those who are under the like Weaknesses and Decays from a  malum stamen  and require principally Nourishment from such Substances as will with the least Trouble possible be assimulated for that purpose  Aqua ad Strumas  D  M  ℞ Rad Oxylapath  lb  ss  Rhabarb Monach  ℥iv  Agaric  ℥ij  Liquorit  Sem Fanicul dul  Coriand ā  ℥ss  Coq

and has been found of good Service but at the first sometimes the  Diaphoretic Antimony  being unwashed it proves Emetick tho' without any Inconveniency upon that account the Points of the Medicine being left gross enough to velicate and draw the Stomach into such Contractions This also avails considerably in Venereal and Leprous Impurities Its Operation is principally expected from its encreasing of natural Perspiration and gently scouring all the secretory Passages  Aqua Theriacalis  ℞ Suc Putam Virid Nucum Jugland  lb  xij  Suc Rutae  lb  ix  Cardui Ben  Calend  Meliss ā  lb  vj

than the  College  Treaclewater It is given as a Cordial in any Fainting or Gripes especially in those which frequently happen in raising a Salivation  In the  Lock  they generally salivate by Unction and it has been observed that the  Lues  and many Cases which would not give way to a Salivation raised by inward means have been overcome by this tho' many are of Opinion that the external Method is most dangerous  Alcohol Chalybis  D  M  ℞ Limatur Chalybis puriss  ℥iij  Sachar Cand rub  ℥ij  Terentur simùl in Alcohol  Dr  M  's Powder of Steel  Take of the finest Steel Ounces red Sugarcandy Ounces let them be reduced together into a fine Powder  This is a very plain easy and most natural Preparation of Steel and is render'd fit thereby to be taken either in Substance or to communicate its Virtues to any Liquor by Infusion It comes nearest to the common Preparation of Steel with Tartar and has the same Qualities of a Deobstruent Its usual Dose is from ℈i to ʒss in a  Chlorosis  and all menstrual Obstructions It is likewise a good Medicine in all Hypochondriacal Affections but as the Cure of such Patients consists generally more in their way of living than in Medicine an Hospital cares not for the Admission of such Invalids  Balsam Lucatelli  ℞ Ol Olivar opt  Terebinth Ven ā  lb  iv  Cerae flavae tenuitèr incisae  lb  ijss  Liquescant simùl addendo sang Draconis subtiliss

Dragonsblood in fine Powder Ounces and mix it into a red Balsam  This is much better than that of the  College  Dispensatory tho' much cheaper and easier made The Dragonsblood gives a much better Colour than the Saunders which is in the other and if either have any Virtues suitable to the whole this bids the fairest and will also much better mix therewith because it in a manner dissolves in the Oyl It is used both inwardly in all Suspicions of internal Ulcerations and externally as a Digestive  Balsam Sulphur Terebinth  is much used in St  Thomas  's Hospital as it is directed to be made in  Bate  's Dispensatory both internally  and in Dressings for the same purpose as it is directed by the common Practice  Balsam Viride  ℞ Ol Lin  lb  iv  Aeris Virid purific pulver  lb  j  Bulliant

Pulv Alexit ā  ℈j  Syr Caryoph q s ut f Bol  An Alexiterial Bole  Take  Venice  Treacle and of the Alexiterial Powder each one Scruple Syrup of Cloves a sufficient Quantity to make into a Bole  This is frequently directed to be taken in order to compose and breath a Person after Amputation or any other Operation which is attended with extreme Pain and threatens a Fever and is repeated as often as occasion requires drinking after it proper Juleps  Bolus cum Calomel  ℞ Calomel opt levigat  Cons Ros rub ā  ℈j  Misc f Bolus  A Bole with Calomel  Take Calomel well levigated one Scruple Conserve of Roses half a Scuple mix into a Bole  This is the common Bole for Salivation and is repeated as the Symptoms require It is also given frequently over Night to be carry'd off by the common Catharticks the  next Morning in any Cases that require brisk Purging  Bolus Emeticus  ℞ Antimonii resuscitat Batean Gr  vij  Cons Ros rub q s f Bol  An Emetick Bole  Take of revived Antimony according to  Bate  Grains Conserve of red Roses a sufficient Quantity to make it into a Bole  In very gross and robust Constitutions this is given preparatory to any Course of Alteratives for sometimes it will work with great Violence insomuch as to render it unsafe to infirm and weakly Persons  Bolus Emeticus Mercurialis  ℞ Turpeth Min opt levig Gr  vij  Cons Ros rub q s f Bol  An Emetick Mercurial Bole  Take of Turbith Mineral well levigated Grains Conserve of red Roses a sufficient Quantity to make into a Bole  This is as rough as the former but is generally made choice of in Venereal and Leprous Cases preparatory to Salivation and is likewise sometimes directed where no such Course is intended particularly in foul Ulcers of long standing the cleansing and lasting Cure of which its Operation does much forward But this is too churlish to be given but to athletick Constitutions  Bolus Hydropicus  ℞ Gambog pulv Gr  xv  Cremor Tartari  ℈ss  Syr e Spin C q s f Bolus  An Hydropick Bole  Take Gamboge Grains Cream of Tartar half a Scruple Syrup of Buckthorn a sufficient Quantity to make them into a Bole  In a Dropsie or a flaccid moist Habit tending thereunto this is a very common Purge and a very good one The Gamboge it self is indeed very rough and works sometimes with great Nauseousness Vomiting and Griping but the Tartar much corrects it by dividing its viscid Parts and making them less sensibly velicate the Coats of the Stomach and Bowels as all resinous  Purges are apt to do It has sometimes also mixed with it a Drop or two of Oyl of Aniseed or any other of the carminitive Oyls to render it less griping This thoroughly purges off watry and viscous Humours and greatly promotes the Discharge by Urine But to render the Cure of a Dropsie lasting there is a Necessity afterwards of restoring and strengthning the Tone of the Parts by proper Medicines for such purposes else they will soon fill again with as much Water as this has carry'd away  Bolus Mercurialis Purgat  ℞ Elect

Jallap Root powdered one Ounce and half Scammony Drams Calomel half an Ounce the solutive Syrup of Roses a sufficient Quantity to make them into the Consistence of a Bole The Dose is Drams in a Morning  This is a sure Purge and will not fail working in the strongest Constitutions It is advisable in all Cases whatsoever as want such Evacuation It must be made pretty stiff else the Calomel will be apt to fall by its great weight whereby it will be unequally mixed and in hot Weather also it will be apt to fret and spoil if made up too thin  Bolus ad Diarrhaeam  ℞ Rhabarb opt pulv  ʒss  Confect  Fracastorii  sine Melle q s ut f  Bolus  A Bole against a Looseness  Take Powder of the finest Rhubarb half a Dram Diascordium without Honey a sufficient Quantity to make it into a Bole  This is to be given in any Fluxes of the Belly that require to be stopped as often as the Urgency of the Symptoms indicate but it is generally directed only at Night going to Bed for the Opiate confines the Rhubarb from immediate Operation and what Effect that has is only just to cleanse off so much Choler or irritating Humours as it finds already separated by the Intestinal Glands and it then so astringes them as to  prevent any further Flux of that kind upon them This Bolus is also frequently given to compose and resettle the Bowels after the Operation of such strong Catharticks as cannot well be born without such a Restorative  Bolus Mercurialis cum Gambog  ℞ Elect Lenitiv  lb  j  Calomelan  Gambog pul ā  ℥ij ʒj  Syr e Spin C q s ad Boli consistentiam  Addendo Ol Anis  ʒjss  Dosis

can be born without Inconveniency  Bolus Diureticus  D  M  ℞ Scillae  ℥j  Hellenii pulv  ℥ss  Ol Anis Chym  ʒss  Dosis  ʒj  bis in die  Dr  M  's Diuretick Bole  Take Squills Ounce Powder of Elicampane half an Ounce Oyl of Aniseed half a Dram The Dose is one Dram twice in a Day  In Asthmatick and Dropsical Habits this is an admirable Medicine for it greatly scours away those Viscidities which stuff the Vessels and hinder due Circulation and detaches them off by the Kidnies But its Use is to be comply'd with for some time together and if so continued the most obstinate Obstructions of the small Vessels that cause both Dropsies and Asthma's will give way to its Efficacy  Cataplasma pro Buhone Pestilen Carbunculo  ℞ Coepar Maj  Allii ā  ℥iij  Pulv Cantharid  ʒj  Sem Senapios pulv

Spanish Flies Dram Mustardseed powder'd  London  Treacle Mithridate and PigeonsDung each Ounce Oyl of Scorpions a sufficient Quantity to make into a Poultus  The Cases this is intended for happen not frequently in the Hospitals But when any Humours are critically discharged in malignant Fevers which are sometimes attended with very surprizing Symptoms this is a good Medicine both to help on their Discharge and defend the Part against Mortifications and Gangrenes which frequently happen in such Cases In confirm'd  Dropsies likewise where the lower Parts have received more Water than can be carried off by the common Evacuations and the Legs are forced to be scarify'd this is of good Service both to prevent Mortification and forward the Drain of such Humours insomuch that the Tone of a Part is sometimes retrieved by this means which would otherwise from a partial Mortification induce a total one  Cataplasma Ischiad  D  W  ℞ Sem Sinap  lb  ss  Pip alb  Rad ZZ ā  ʒj  Misc f pulvis

Ginger each Ounce mix together in a fine Powder and keep in a Glass close stopped and just at the time of using make into a Poultus with a sufficient Quantity of Oxymel of Squils  This is a very warm Application and will therefore sometimes help to break away those Humours which fix upon the Joints  occasioning there intolerable Pains and which will not give way to any other means It is to be applyed as often as the Symptoms and Urgency of Pain require and the Part can bear for it is so hot as frequently to vesicate the Skin but it then generally has the best Effect the Pain most commonly abating upon drawing out by Perspiration such Humours as will raise a Dew upon the Skin and sometimes lift it up into little Blisters but in such Cases all the Harm is the Trouble  Cataplasma pro

wild Carrot and Juniperberries each Pound and half put them all together into a Bag to be steep'd in Gallons of unhopp'd Ale while it works half a Pint to be drank or times in a Day  This is of good use to absorb and dry up the remaining Moistures and watry Humours which the ordinary Catharticks leave behind and will make the Cure lasting which otherwise would be but short In all scorbutick Habits likewise especially where the  Extreams tend towards too great a Fulness and Corpulency this is of real Service if the Patients are kept to it for some time together In all Tendencies likewise towards a Palsy it does much good both by drying away watery and sloughy Humours which destroy due Sensation and giving Warmth and Briskness to the Juices  Confectio  Fracastorii    Vt in

and operates with great Quickness if given in a proper Quantity of Liquor as Whitewine Whey or any such Diluter For what is drank with it greatly helps its Operation and makes it pass with much more Safety because it is so sharp as otherwise to rake the Membranes too much which will sometimes straiten the Passages and encrease the Obstruction A Quantity of Fluid likewise much favours the Operation of stimulating Diureticks not only as a Vehicle but because it presses the faster by its Weight thro' the depending Passages In all Suspicions of the Stone and Gravel this is given once or twice in a Day and continued according to the Importance of the Symptoms but in sloughy and viscid Obstructions it is the more particularly fitted to break thro' For Oily Medicines are most suitable to stony Concretions which stop the Vessels because they relax and render slippery the Passages but in Collections of viscid Matter they only encrease the Stoppage and  then it is these pungent
