 AN ELEGY WRITTEN AMONG THE RUINS OF AN ABBEY By the AUTHOR of the NUN  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY in PallMall  MDCCLXV  Price Six Pence  AN ELEGY  WHERE sighs the Zephyr to yon lonely Tree  A solemn Grove its leafy Mantle spread  Where bend yon mould'ring Turrets o'er the Sea  A venerable Dome once rear'd  ts Head  The solemn Grove the venerable Dome  Were erst frequented by a num'rous Train  Ev'n chaste as they who Dian's Mountain roam  But not subjected to her gentle Reign  Far other Goddess did this Train obey  Far other Temples other Altars rais'd  Far other Meaning breath'd their Choral Lay  Far other Incense on their Altars blaz'd  Veil'd Superstition wak'd her magic Sound  Bad Albion's Sons forsake the splendid Court  Forsake Amusement's variegated Round  And to her  able Standard here resort  Alas obsequious to her stern Command  A sullenpensive Brotherhood they came  Refus'd to trace the Paths by Nature plan'd  And raz'd from Glory's Page their ancient Name  Nor these alone were found incloister'd here  Here also dwelt the simpleminded Swain  Who wrapt in Sloth dream'd out the lazy Year  'While Industry sat weeping on the Plain'  The many Temples rising fair to view  Which tow'ring Superstition call'd her own  With Hand unerring radiant Truth o'erthrew  And snatch'd th' Impostor from her tinsel'd Throne  On yon Dustlevel'd Spire the crafty Maid  With Indignation brooding in her Breast  Sits gloomilyHer Vot'ries all are fled  Her Lamps extinguish'd and her Rites suppress'd  Within her Hand a vacant String she holds  That one connected many a hallow'd Bead  The blotted Scroll the other Hand unfolds  Contains the Maxims of her slighted Creed  Couch'd at her Feet behold a mould'ring Shrine  Of various Relics once the dread Abode  Where runs the Spider o'er his treach'rous Line  Where lurks the Beetle and the loathsome Toad  On Darkness' wing now sails the midnight Hour  When for the grateful Sound of choral Pray'r  The shrieking Owl from yon disparted Tow'r  With Notes of Horror wakes her trembling Ear  Of human Grandeur mark the fleeting Day  How frail each Purpose and each Wish how vain  The strongbuilt Domes the cloister'd Fanes decay  And Ruin hovers round the desert Scene  The Path that leads to yonder shatter'd Pile  Is now perplex'd with many a sordid Brier  No Crowd is seen within the sacred Isle  The Sabbath mourns its longdeserted Quire  The golden Crozier blended with the Dust  In horrid Folds the Serpent clasps around  The pow'rful Image and the sainted Bust  Defam'd unhallow'd press the weedy Ground  Not distant far her goldencircled Tow'r  Th' inviolable Dome  majestic rear'd  On whose dread Altar breath'd some hidden Pow'r  By Terror guarded and by Kings rever'd  To which Asylum ev'n th' Assassin came  His Hand audacious still imbrued with Gore  The Boon of full Impunity to claim  While feeble Justice wept her baffled Lore  So Truth at length dissolv'd the mental Chain  And banish'd Error from th' enlighten'd Shore  So clos'd at length the busyacted Scene  The Curtain drop'd and Folly's Mask was o'er  Then gladsome  Ceres  rais'd her drooping Head  While yellow Harvests gilt the smiling Plain  Beheld a youthful Band around her spread  With Sickles arm'd to reap the bearded Grain  The Warrior then beneath the trailing Vest  The peaceful Cassock or the drowsy Cowl  No longer quench'd the Flame within his Breast  Or lull'd the Purpose of his daring Soul  But rush'd undaunted to the doubtful War  Pursued where Glory led the radiant Way  Till Neptune rising on his coral Car  Resign'd his wat'ry World to  Britain's  Sway  The Virgin Fair by venal Guardians doom'd  By Error prompted or subdued by Force  No more in Cloisters drear their Days consum'd  Like Flow'rets strew'd around the senseless Corse  Triumphant  Hymen  hail'd the blissful Hour  And saw a whiterob'd social Train approach  For whom the Pleasures dress'd the happy Bow'r  And scatter'd Roses o'er the destin'd Couch  Still other Blessings from this Change appear'd  No injur'd Family did then behold  On loit'ring Monks its native Wealth confer'd  Nor spacious Altars cover'd with its Gold  Full many trod that crooked Path to Fame  Yet from her Hand receiv'd no lasting Meed  She from her Annals rends their fading Name  And gives to Infamy the worthless Deed  But Vengeance some pursued with dire Disgrace  Pursued beyond the Circle of its Sphere  Ev'n to the Cemetery's dark Recess  Nor spar'd them sleeping on the peaceful Bier  Beside the spreading of that sombrous Yew  Where yawns with hideous Chasm the vaulted Cave  Presenting to the fix'd astonish'd View  The Profanation of a rifled Grave  The largeendowing  Rufus  lay inurn'd  With many a sculptur'd Image on his Shrine  That smit with Sorrow o'er his Ashes mourn'd  The SisterGraces and the tuneful Nine  Imprinted on Tradition's storied Leaf  Is found to this sepulchral Spot confin'd  A Terrorbreathing Tale that wins Belief  And oft repeated by the neighb  ring  ind  From where yon Mountain shades the dreary Pla  Attracted by the Scent of human Blood  A Troop of Wolves voracious scour'd amain  And at this Charnel Vault requir'd their Food  When horrid to relate they burst the Tomb  And swift descending to the deepest Shade  Uptore the shrouded Tenant from its Womb  And o'er the mangled Corse relentless prey'd  The paly Stars with dim reluctant Light  Like Tapers glimmer'd on their Orgies foul  While gliding Spectres scream'd with wild Affright  Reecho'd loud by their tremendous Howl  Ah what avail'd the solemnmoving Herse  The sabledmantled Cars the Fun'ral Throng  Grav'd on his Monument the soothing Verse  The Priests the Torches and the choral Song  Misjudging Wretch while thou with Hand profuse  Thy Treasures on this Mansion didst entail  And pour down Riches on the vow'd Recluse  Thine Orphan Babes partook a scanty Meal  Thy widow'd Fair her Cheek bedew'd with Tears  Approach'd with suppliant Knee the CloisterGate  There oft disclos'd in vain her poignant Cares  Returning still to weep her haploso Fate  FINIS
