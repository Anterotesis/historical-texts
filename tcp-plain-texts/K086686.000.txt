 THE HIGHLANDER A POEM IN Six CANTOS  Caetera quae vacuas tenilissent carmina mentes  Omnia jam vulgata  VIRG  EDINBURGH  rinted by WAL RUDDIMAN jun and COMPANY MDCCLVIII  THE HIGHLANDER A POEM  CANTO I  THE youth I sing who to himself unknown  Lost to the world and CALEDONIA's throne  Sprung o'er his mountains to the arms of Fame  And wing'd by Fate his sire's avenger came  That knowledge learn'd so long deny'd by fate  And found that blood as merit made him great  The aged chieftain on the bier is laid  And grac'd with all the honours of the dead  The youthful warriors as the corse they bear  Droop the sad head and shed the gen'rous tear  For Abria's shore Tay's winding banks they leave  And bring the Hero to his father's grave  His filial tears the godlike ALPIN sheds  And tow'rds the foe his gallant warriors leads  The chief along his silent journey wound  And fix'd his rainy eyes upon the ground  Behind advanc'd his followers sad and slow  In all the dark solemnity of woe  Mean time fierce SCANDINAVIA's hostile pow'r  Its squadrons spread along the murm'ring shore  Prepar'd at once the city to invade  And conquer CALEDONIA in her head  His camp for night the royal SUENO forms  Resolv'd with morn to use his Danish arms  Now in the ocean sunk the flaming day  And streak'd the ruddy west with setting ray  Around great INDULPH in the senate sat  The noble Chiefs of CALEDONIA's state  In mental scales they either forces weigh  And act before the labours of the day  Arrange in thought their CALEDONIA's might  And bend their little army to the fight  Thus they consult Brave ALPIN's martial gait  Approach'd the portals of the dome of state  Resolv'd to offer to his king and lord  The gen'rous service of his trusty sword  Th' unusual sight the gallant chief admires  The bending arches and the lofty spires  On either side the gate in order stand  The antient Kings of CALEDONIA's land  The marble lives they breathe within the stone  And still as once the royal warriors frown  The FERGUS's are seen above the gate  This first created that restor'd the state  In warlike pomp the awful forms appear  And bending threaten from the stone the spear  While to their side young ALEION seems to rise  And on her fathers turns her smiling eyes  And next appears GREGORIUS' awful name  HIBERNIA's conqu'ror for a gen'rous fame  Incass'd in arms the royal Hero stands  And gives his captive all his conquer'd lands  The filial heart of hapless ALPIN's son  In marble melts and beats within the stone  Revenge still sparkles in the Hero's eye  Around the PICTS a nameless slaughter lye  The youthful warrior thus reviews with joy  The godlike series of his ancestry  The godlike forms the drooping HERO cheer  And keen ambition half believes the seer  Eager he shoots into the spacious gate  His eye commands without his followers wait  No frowning spearman guards the awful door  No borrow'd terror arms the hand of pow'r  No cringing bands of sycophants appear  To send false echoes to the monarch's ear  Merit's sost voice oppression's mournful groan  Advanc'd unstiffl'd to th' attentive throne  The Hero ent'ring took his solemn stand  Among the gallant warriors of the land  His manly port the staring chiefs admire  And halfheard whispers blow the soldier's fire  A while his form engag'd the monarch's eyes  At length he raised the music of his voice  "Whence is the youth I see fierce DENMARK warms  Each gen'rous breast and fires 'em into arms  A face once known is in that youth exprest  And mends a dying image in my breast"  He said And thus the Youth "'midst rocks afar  I heard of DENMARK and of SUENO's war  My country's safety in my bosom rose  For CALEDONIA's sons should meet her foes  We ought not meanly wait the storm at home  But rush afar and break it 'ere it come  Few are my foll'wers but these few are true  We come to serve our country fame and you"  He said The king retorts "thy form thy mind  Declare the scion of a gen'rous kind  With SCOTIA's foes maintain the stern debate  And spring from valour to the arms of state  Whoe'er would raise his house in ALBION shou'd  Lay the foundation in her en'mies' blood"  Then to the Chiefs "Supporters of my throne  Your sires brought oft the Roman Eagles down  Yourselves my lords have caus'd the haughty DANE  To curse the land he try'd so oft in vain  Norvegian firs oft brought them o'er the waves  For ALBION's crown but ALBION gave'em graves  Be still the same exert yourselves like men  And of th' invaders wash our rocks again  Tho' few our numbers these in arms grown old  In ALBION's and in INDULPH's cause are bold  The brave man looks not when the clarion sounds  To hostile numbers but his country's wounds  Bold to the last and dauntless he'll go on  At once his country's soldier and her son"  The monarch thus his royal mind exprest  The patriot kindling in each gen'rous breast  Each chieftain's mind with pleasure goes before  Already mingling with the battle's roar  In thought each Hero sweeps the bloody plain  And deals in fancy death upon the DANE  DUMBAR arose the brave remains of wars  Silver'd with years o'errun with honest scars  Great in the senate in the field renown'd  The senior stood attention hung arround  He thus "Fierce DENMARK all the North commands  And belches numbers on our neighb'ring lands  England's subdu'd the Saxons are o'ercome  And meanly own a Danish lord at home  Scarce now a blast from SCANDINAVIA roars  But wafts a hostile squadron to our shores  One fleet destroy'd another crowns the waves  The sons seem anxious for their father's graves  Thus war returns in an eternal round  Battles on baules press and wound on wound  Our numbers thinn'd our godlike warriors dead  Pale CALEDONIA hangs her sickly head  We must be wise be frugal of our store  Add art to arms and caution to our pow'r  Beneath the sable mantle of the night  Rush on the foe and latent urge the fight  Conduct with few may foil this mighty pow'r  And DENMARK shun th' inhospitable shore"  The senior spoke a gen'ral voice approves  To arm his kindredbands each chief removes  Night from the east the drousy world invades  And clothes the warriors in her dusky shades  The vassalthrong advance a manly cloud  And with their sable ranks the chieftains shroud  Each chief now here now there in armour shines  Waves thro' the ranks and draws the lengthen'd lines  Thus on a night when rattling tempests war  Thro' broken clouds appears a blazing star  Now veils its head now rushes on the sight  And shoots a livid horror thro' the night  The full form'd columns in the midnight hour  Begin their silent journey tow'rds the shore  Thro' ev'ry rank the chiefs inciting roam  And rouzing whispers hiss along the gloom  A rising hill whose nightinvelop'd brow  Hung o'er th' incamped squadrons of the foe  Shoots to the deep its ooze immantled arm  And steadfast struggles with the raging storm  Here ends the moving host its winding road  And here condenses like a sable cloud  Which long was gath'ringon the mountain's brow  Then broke in thunder on the vales below  Again the chiefs in midnight council met  Before the king maintain the calm debate  This waits the equal contest of the day  That rushes headlong to the nightly fray  At length young ALPIN stood and thus begun  "Great king supporter of our antient throne  Brought up in mountains and from councils far  I am a novice in the art of war  Yet hear this thoughtWithin the womb of night  Confirm the troops and arm the youth for fight  While softlytreading to yon' camp I go  And mark the disposition of the foe  Or wakeful arm they for the dismal fight  Or wrapt within the lethargy of night  Are left abandon'd to our SCOTTISH sword  By sleep's soft hand in fatal chains secur'd  If DENMARK sleeps in night's infolding arms  Expect your spy to point out latent storms  But they in arms too long delay'd my speed  Then place the faithful scout among the dead"  A gen'ral voice th' exploring thought approves  And ev'ry wish with youthful ALPIN moves  The Hero slides along the gloom of night  The campfires send afar their gleaming light  Athwart his side the trusty sabre flies  The various plaid hangs plaited down his thighs  The crested helm waves awful on his head  His manly trunk the mail and corslet shade  The pond'rous spear supports his dusky way  The waving steel reflects the stellar way  Arriv'd the dauntless youth solemnly slow  Observant mov'd along the silent foe  Some 'brac'd in arms the midnight vigil keep  Some o'er the livid campfires nod to sleep  The feeding courser to the stake is bound  The prostrate horseman stretch'd along the ground  Extended here the brawny footman lay  And dosing wore the lazy night away  The watchman there by sleep's soft hand o'erpower'd  Starts at the blast and half unsheaths his sword  Th' exploring youth thro' night's involving cloud  Circling the foe their disposition view'd  At length the Hero's dusky journey ends  Where HACO feasted with his Danish friends  HACO by more than SUENO's blood was great  The promis'd monarch of the triple state  The Scandinavian camp the youth secur'd  With watchful troops and not unfaithful sword  Two oaks from earth by headlong tempests torn  Supply the fire and in the circle burn  Around with social talk the feast they share  And drown in bowls the CALEDONIAN war  O'erpower'd at length by slumber's silken hand  They press the beach and cow'r upon the strand  A gallant deed the Mountainyouth design'd  And nurs'd a growing action in his mind  Awful the chief advanc'd his armour bright  Reflects the fire and shines along the night  Hov'ring he stood above the sleepingband  And shone an awful column o'er the strand  Thus osten to the midnight traveller  The stalking figures of the dead appear  Silent the spectre tow'rs before the sight  And shines an awful image thro' the night  At length the giant phantom hovers o'er  Some grave unhallow'd stain'd with murder'd gore  Thus ALPIN stood He exiles to the dead  Sixwarrioryouths the trembling remnant fled  Young HACO starts unsheaths his shining sword  And views his friends in ironchains secur'd  He rushes headlong on the daring foe  The godlike ALPIN renders blow for blow  Their clatt'ring swords on either armour fell  Fire flashes round as steel contends with steel  Young ALPIN's sword on HACO's helmet broke  And to the ground the stagg'ring warrior took  Leaning on his broad shield the hero bends  ALPIN aloft in air his sword suspends  His arm uprais'd he downward bends his brow  But scorn'd to take advantage of thefoe  Young HACO from his hand the weapon threw  And from his flaming breast these accents drew  "Bravest of men who cou'd thro' night come on  Who durst attack and foil an host alone  I see the man high on the warrior plac'd  Both mend each other in your noble breast  Accept brave man the friendship of a Dane  Who hates the Scot but yet can love the man"  He said while thus the Scot "with joy I find  The man so pow'rful in an en'my's mind  Your forces fled amidst night's dark alarms  You both cou'd stand and use your gallant arms  Such valiant deeds thy dauntless soul confess  That I the warrior tho' the Dane embrace"  His brawny arms he round the Hero flung  As they embrace the clashing corslets rung  The Dane resumes "With the sun's rising beam  We may in fields of death contend for fame  Receive this shield that midst tomorrow's storms  HACO may grateful shun his wellknown arms"  He said and gave the goldenamel'd round  While as he reach'd the studded thongs resound  The amicable colloquy they end  And each a foe clasp'd in his arms a friend  This to the camp his dusky journey bends  While that to ALBION's chiefs the hill ascends  Th' exploring journey all with pleasure hear  And own the valiant scout their noble care  Dissolv'd the council the attack declin'd  Each with the gift of sleep indulg'd his mind  And 'midst his kindredbands supinely laid  Each softly slumber'd on a mossy bed  His mind to soft repose young ALPIN bends  And seeks the humble circle of his friends  Reelining on a rock the Hero lies  And gradual slumbers steal upon his eyes  Still to his mind the DANISH camp arose  Hung on his dreams and hagg'd his calm repose  Once more he mix'd with HACO in the sight  And urg'd impending on the DANISH flight  End of  Canto  first  CANTO II  HEav'n's op'ning portals shot the beam of day  Earth chang'd her sable robe to sprightly grey  To West's dark goal the humid night is fled  The sun o'er ocean rears his beamy head  The splendid gleam from Scottish steel returns  And all the light reflexive mountains burns  Deepsounding bagpipes gaining on the air  With lofry voice awake the Scottish war  The gallant chiefs along the mountain's brow  Stand 'cass'd in arms and low'r upon the foe  Or awful thro' the forming squadrons shine  Build up the ranks and stretch the lengthen'd line  Each Clan their standards from the beam unbind  They float along and clap upon the wind  The hieroglyphic honours of the brave  Acquire a double horror as they wave  The Southern warriors stretch the lines of war  Full on the right obedient to Dumbar  Harden'd to manhood in the school of arms  He moves along sedately as he forms  Next deeply stretch their regular array  To break the iron tempest of the day  The sons of LENNOX and their gallant Grahame  Oft honour'd with the bloody spoils of fame  He tow'rs along with unaffected pride  Whilst they display their blazing arms aside  Great SOMERLED possest the middle space  And rang'd the kindred valour of his race  The dauntless sons of MORCHUAN's rocky soil  And the rough manhood of MULL's seagirt isle  The Mountainchiefs in burning arms incass'd  And carrying all their country in their breast  Undaunted rear their useful arms on high  Now fought for food and now for liberty  Now met the sport of hills now of the main  Here pierc'd a stag and there transfix'd a DANE  Tho' nature's walls their homely huts inclose  To guard their homely huts tho' mountains rose  Yet feeling ALBION in their breasts they dare  From rocks to rush and meet the distant war  The fullform'd lines now crown the mountain's brow  And wave a blazing forest o'er the foe  The King commands down in array they creep  Their clanking arms beat time to ev'ry step  As they descend they stretch along the strand  Restore the ranks and make a solemn stand  Before the camp the Danish columns rise  And stretch the battle to the clarion's voice  Majestic SUENO kept the higher place  Great in the war as in his noble race  And when the sword to milder peace shall yield  In council great as in the thund'ring field  Behind their King to either hand afar  Rough NORWAY's sons extend the front of war  He moves incass'd in steel and majesty  Along the ranks and plans them with his eye  Speaks his commands with unaffected ease  And unconcern'd the coming battle sees  Bent on his purpose obstinately brave  To win a kingdom or an honest grave  He seem'd to look tow'rds Norway's rocky shore  And sayI'll conquer or return no more  Far to the right fierce MAGNUS' fiery sway  Compels the troops and rears the quick array  Haughty he moves and catching flame from far  Looks tow'rds the Scots anticipates the war  Feels cruel joys in all his fibres rise  And gathers all his fury to his eyes  Young HACO on the left the battle rears  And moves majestic thro' a wood of spears  With martial skill the rising ranks he forms  No novice in the irontrade of arms  Thus form'd the DANES in unconfus'd array  Stretch their long lines along the murm'ring sea  Their anchor'd ships a sable wood behind  Nod on the wave and whistle to the wind  On either side thus stretch'd the manly line  With darting gleam the steelclad ridges shine  On either side the gloomy lines incede  Foot rose with foot and head advanc'd with head  Thus when two winds descend upon the main  To fight their battles on the wat'ry plain  In two black lines the equal waters croud  On either side the whitetop'd ridges nod  At length they break and raise a bubbling sound  While echo rumbles from the rocks around  Thus march the DANES with spreading wings afar  Thus moves the horror of the Scottish war  While drowsy silence droops her mournful head  Whose calm repose the clanking arms invade  The Mountainyouth with unaffected pride  Twice thirty warriors rising by his side  His native band precedes the Scottish forms  A shining column in the day of arms  In act to throw he holds the pond'rous spear  And views with awful smiles the face of war  Nodding along his polish'd helmet shines  And looks superior o'er the subject lines  On either side devour'd the narrow ground  The moving troopsThe hostile ridges frown'd  From either host the HERALD's awful breath  Rung in the trumpet's throat the peal of death  The martial sound foments their kindling rage  Onward they rush and in a shout engage  The swords thro' air their gleaming journeys fly  Crash on the helms and tremble in the sky  Groan follows groan and wound succeeds on wound  While dying bodies quiver on the ground  Thus when devouring hatchetmen invade  With sounding steel the forest's leavy head  The mountains ring with their repeated strokes  The tap'ring firs the elms the aged oaks  Quake at each gash then nod the head and yield  Groan as they fall and tremble on the field  Thus fell the men blood forms a lake around  While groans and spears hoarse harmony resound  The mountains hear and thunder back the noise  And eccho stammers with unequal voice  As yet the battle hung in doubtful scales  Each bravely fought in death or only fails  All all are bent on death or victory  Resolv'd to conquer or with glory die  Fierce DENMARK's honour kindles fire in these  On these pale ALBION bends her parenteyes  This sternly says "shall DENMARK's children fly"  But that "or save or with your country die"  The SCOTS a Stream wou'd sweep the DANES away  The DANES a Rock repell'd the SCOTS array  They fight alternate and alternate fly  Both wound both conquer both with glory die  Thrice HACO strove to break DUMBAR's array  And thrice DUMBAR impell'd him to the sea  The fiery MAGNUS foaming on the right  Pours on the Mountainchiefs his warriormight  The Mountainyouths the furious chief restrain  And turn the battle back upon the DANE  The ranks of SUENO stand in firm array  As hoary rocks repel the raging sea  The HERO to the phalanx crouds his might  And calmly manages the standing fight  Not idly madd'ning in the bloody fray  He wears delib'rately the foe away  Straight on his spear the godlike ALPIN stood  His flaming armour 'smear'd with Danish blood  He casts behind an awecommanding look  And to his few but valiant followers spoke  "The cautious DANES O friends in firm array  With perseverance may secure the day  Our people fallLet us their force divide  Invade with flame their transports on the tide  They will defend the SCOTS restore the day  Follow my friends your ALPIN leads the way"  He said and rush'd upon the phalanx'd DANE  The bending ranks beneath his sword complain  Arms groans of men beat time to ev'ry wound  Nod at each blow and thunder on the ground  Behind his friends advance with martial care  Move step for step and spread the lane of war  He low'rs before and clears the rugged road  They rush behind a rough and headlong flood  Thus on some eminence the lab'ring swain  Unlocks his sluice to drench the thirsty plain  With mattock arm'd he shapes the water's course  The liquid flows behind with rapid force  Thus valiant ALPIN hews his bloody way  And thus his friends force thro' their firm array  With great effort he seizes on the strand  Turns to his friends and issues his command  "Thicken your lines the battle's shock sustain  And gall with vigour the recoiling DANE  Brave CALEDONIANS face your country's foe  Your lives are hers her own on her bestow"  He added notThe valiant youths obey  The HERO shap'd along his rapid way  Rush'd to the camp and seiz'd a flaming brand  Then took his lofty seat upon the strand  Swift from his arm the crackling ember flies  Whizzes along and kindles in the skies  The pitchy hull receives the sparkling fire  The kindling ship the fanning winds inspire  Black smoke ascends at length the flames arise  Hiss thro' the shrouds and crackle in the skies  The riding fleet is all in darkness lost  Its wreathy wings the flame spreads on the blast  Red embers falling from the burning shroud  Hiss in the wave and bubble in the flood  Great SUENO turns and sees the flame behind  swell its huge columns on the driving wind  Then thus to ERIC"Urge your speedy flight  Recal the fiery MAGNUS from the right  Quick let him come th' endanger'd transports save  And dash against the burning ship the wave  The youth obeys and flying o'er the sand  Repeats in MAGNUS' ear the king's command  The warrior starts rage sparkling in his eyes  He tow'rs along resounding as he flies  He comesFrom SUENO's army squadrons fall  Around the chief and rear the manly wall  Till in their front the stately chief appears  They wave behind an iron wood of spears  In all the gloomy pomp of battle low'r  And beat with sounding steps the fatal shore  Bent to support the flame his thin array  Young ALPIN draws along the murm'ring sea  He holds the massy spear in act to throw  And bends his fiery eyes upon the foe  Advanc'dwith awful din the fight began  Steel speaks on steel man urges upon man  Groans shouts arms men a jarring discord sound  Gain on the sky and shake the mountains round  Fierce MAGNUS here wou'd rush into the main  Young ALPIN there wou'd keep at bay the DANE  One pushes the swift boat into the sea  Thro' his bent back the faulchion cleaves its way  Another dashes to the ship the wave  And bends at once into a wat'ry grave  Spouts with departing breath the bubbling flood  And dyes the water with his foaming blood  Thus fought the menBehind the flame resounds  Gains on the fleet and spreads its wasteful bounds  Great MAGNUS burning at the dismal sight  Advanc'd with rage redoubled to the fight  "Degen'rate DANES"The raging warrior cries  "The day is lostYour fame your honour dies  Advancecondense your ranksbear on your way  And sweep these daring striplings to the sea"  The men advanceproceeds their haughty lord  And wounds the air with his impatient sword  Bending where ALPIN reapt the bloody plain  "Turn here's a man turn stripling here's a DANE"  He saidThe Mountainwarrior turns his eyes  Then sternly wheels and with a blow replies  Great MAGNUS falling on young ALPIN's shield  Adds to the dismal thunder of the field  Revengful ALPIN with descending blade  Crashes the shining thunder on his head  They aim defend their swords at every stroke  Talk on the way and gleam along the smoke  At length on MAGNUS Fate deals home a wound  He nods to death and thunders on the ground  Starting from the wide wound the bubbling blood  Sinks thro' the sand and rolls a smoaking flood  Prone on the strand extended ev'ry way  Clad o'er with steel a shining trunk he lay  Thus on its lofty seat shou'd winds invade  The statue keeps the mem'ry of the dead  It quakes at ev'ry blast and nods around  Then falls a shapeless ruin to the ground  The DANES beholding their commander die  Start from their ranks and in confusion fly  The youth pursues the flames behind him roar  Catch all the fleet and clothe with smoke the shore  Mean time great SUENO DENMARK's valiant King  Round royal INDULPH bends the hostile ring  Hemm'd in a circle of invading men  They face on ev'ry side the closing DANE  Deal blow for blow and wound return for wound  And bring the stagg'ring en'my to the ground  Great SOMERLED ARGYLE's majestic lord  Thro' HARALD's sounding helmet drives his sword  Stagg'ring he falls his rattling arms resound  And in the pangs of death he bites the ground  Thro' HILRIC's shield great INDULPH urg'd the spear  It pierc'd his breast and smok'd behind in air  Groaning he sinks as when repeated strokes  Bring headlong to the ground the slaughter'd ox  Brave GRAHAME thro' mighty CANUTE urg'd the spear  Where 'twixt the helm and mail the neck was bare  Press'd with the helm his pond'rous head inclin'd  He nodding falls as trees o'erturn'd by wind  While thus the en'my's front the chieftains wore  And pil'd with hostile trunks the fatal shore  By slow degrees their force declines away  Surrounding DENMARK gains upon the day  Great INDULPH stood amidst the warriorring  All give attention to their valiant king  "Hear me ye chiefs" the mournful monarch cries  "We fall to day our state our country dies  Let us acquit ourselves of ALBION's death  And yield in her defence our latest breath"  He said and rush'd from the surrounding ring  And 'midst the battle sought the DANISH king  Ready to fight the royal warriors stood  And long'd to revel in each others blood  While ALPIN rushing from the flaming shore  With wasteful path pursu'd the flying pow'r  Hew'd thro' great SUENO's ring his bloody way  And to the desp'rate chieftains gave the day  Rush'd 'twixt great INDULPH and bold SUENO's sword  And with his royal life preserv'd his lord  Brave SUENO nods falls to the strand and cries  "O honour DENMARK lost undone"and die  But still fierce DENMARK made a broken stand  Here stands a squadron there a gloomy band  Rears a firm column on the smoky shore  Makes the last efforts of a dying pow'r  Thus after fire thro' lanes its way has took  A prostrate village lies o'erwhelm'd in smoke  But here and there some sable turrets stand  And lock a dismal ruin o'er the land  So stood the DANES but soon o'erpower'd they fly  Stumble along and in their flight they dic  NORVEGIA's sons of MAGNUS' fire bereft  Fell down before the chieftains of the left  The great DUMBAR upon the right repell'd  Young HACO's force and swept him off the field  He winds his hasty march along the coast  Fights as he flies and shields his little host  At length within a wood o'er shades the sea  With new fell'd oaks he walls his thin array  Bent on his fate and obstinately brave  There mark'd at once his battlefield and grave  End of  Canto  second  CANTO III  AS when beneath the night's tempestuous cloud  Embattl'd winds assail the leafy wood  Tear on their fable way with awful sound  And bring the groaning forest to the ground  The trunks of elms the shrub the fir the oak  In one confusion sink beneath the shock  So death's sad spoils the bloody field bestrow'd  The haughty chieftain the ignoble croud  The coward brave partake the common wound  Are friends in death and mingle on the ground  Dark night approach'dthe flaming lord of day  Had plung'd his glowing circle in the sea  On the blue sky the gath'ring clouds arise  And tempests clap their wings along the skies  The murm'ring voice of heav'n at distance fails  And eddying whirlwinds howl along the vales  The sky inwrapt in awful darkness low'rs  And threatens to descend at once in show'rs  The CALEDONIAN chiefs to shun the storm  Beneath a leafy oak their council form  An antient trunk supports the weary king  The nobles bend around the standing ring  With swords unsheath'd the awful forms appear'd  Their shining arms with DANISH blood besmear'd  Their eyes shoot fire their meins unsettled shew  The battle frowns as yet upon their brow  The monarch rose and leaning on the oak  Stretch'd out his hand and to the nobles spoke  "My lords the DANES for so just heav'n decreed  Ev'n on that shore they thought to conquer bleed  In vain Death wrapt our fathers in his gloom  We raise them in our actions from the tomb  Not infamous their aim o'er lands afar  To spread destruction and the plague of war  To meet the sons of battle as they roam  Content to ward them from their native home  To shew invaders that they dar'd to die  For barren rocks for fame and liberty  In you they live fall'n DENMARK's host may shew  Accept my thanks your country thanks you too"  He added not but turn'd his eyes around  Till in the ring the valiant youth he found  "Approach brave youth" the smiling monarch cry'd  "Your country's soldier and your country's pride  SCOTLAND shall thank thee for this gallant strife  While grateful INDULPH owes to thee his life"  Thus he advancingand with ardour prest  The gallant warrior to his royal breast  The unpresumptuous ALPIN bends his eyes  And mix'd with blushes to the king replies  "To save our king our country's antient throne  Are debts incumbent on her ev'ry son  O monarch add it not to ALPIN's praise  That of this gen'ral debt his part he pays"  Thus said the youth and modestly retir'd  While as he moves the king and chiefs admir'd  Slow to his stand his easy steps he bears  And hears his praises with unwilling ears  The king resumes"O chiefs O valiant peers  Glad CALEDONIA dries her running tears  The warrior rais'd his faulchion o'er her head  Now sleeps forgotten on an earthen bed  Fierce SCANDINAVIA's fatal storms are o'er  Her thunderbolts lie harmless on the shore  But as when after night has beat a storm  On the mild morn some spots the sky deform  The broken clouds from ev'ry quarter sail  Join their black troops and all the heav'ns veil  The winds arise descends the sluicy rain  The storm with force redoubl'd beats the plain  So when the youthful HACO shall afar  Collect the broken fragments of the war  The Hero arm'd with SUENO's death may come  And claim an expiation on his tomb  Deep in that wood the gallant warrior lies  Who shall to night his little camp surprize  Surround the martial DANE with nightly care  And give the final stroke to dying war  Hence NORWAY's ships shall shun our fatal sea  And point the crooked beak another way  If chance they spy where oft their armies fell  Shall turn the prow and croud away the sail"  He said no more the gen'rous chiefs arise  Bent on the glory of the enterprize  Eager to climb thro' dang'rous paths to fame  The nightly war they severally claim  One chief observ'd where godlike HACO lay  This knew the woodand that the dusky way  Another urg'd his more unweary'd friends  And ev'ry chieftain something recommends  Thus for the arduous task the chiefs contest  While each wou'd grasp the danger to his breast  Th' attentive monarch heard their brave debates  And with a secret joy his soul dilates  Young ALPIN burns to urge the war of night  To mix again with HACO in the fight  Eager he stood and thus the chiefs adrest  The warrior lab'ring in his manly breast  "King gallant chiefsthis enterprize I claim  Here let me fix my unestablish'd fame  Already you have beat her arduous path  Reapt glorious harvests in the fields of death  Repeated feats fix'd fame within your pow'r  But I gleam once then sink and am no more  Nor am I wholly ign'rant of the fight  I've urg'd the gloomy battles of the night  Aebudae's chief once touch'd on ABRIA'S strand  And swept our mountains with his pilf'ring band  All day they drove our cattle to the sea  I went at midnight and rescu'd the prey  With a poor handful and a faithful sword  Dispers'd the robbers and their haughty lord  'Twas I commandedthese the gallant men  May we not act that midnight o'er again"  The Hero spoke a murm'ring voice ensu'd  Of loud applauseeach Hero's mind subdued  The glorious danger to the youth resigns  He tow'rs along and marshals up his lines  Some gallant youths to share his fame arise  And mingle in the glorious enterprize  The warriorband move on in firm array  He tow'rs before along the sounding sea  Thro' their tall spears the singing tempest raves  And falling headlong on the spumy waves  Pursues the ridgy sea with awful roar  And throws the liquid mountains on the shore  In each short pause before the billow breaks  The clanking CALEDONIAN armour speaks  Thus on some night when sable tempests roar  The watchman wearying of his lonely hour  Hears some rent branch to squeak 'twixt ev'ry blast  But in each ruder gust the creak is lost  The king and gallant chiefs with wishful eyes  Pursue the youthful warrior as he flies  His praise thro' all the noble circle ran  Approach'd the ghastly figure of a man  His visage pale his loeks are bleach'd with years  His tott'ring steps he onward scarcely bears  His limbs are lac'd with blood a hideous sight  And his wet garments shed the tears of night  With slow approach he lifts his fading eyes  And rais'd the squeaking treble of his voice  "O king I feel the leaden hand of death  To the dark tomb I tread the gen'ral path  Hear me O king for this I left the field  For this to thee my dying form reveal'd  NORWAY in vain had interpos'd her flood  I come alas to pay the debt of blood  Possest of crimes which the good king pursu'd  In fell conspiracy unblest I vow'd  With fierce DOVALUS that I live to tell  By us by us the great king MALCOLM fell  Touch'd with remorse behind my shield I laid  His smiling child and wrapt him in my plaid  Now to the sea we urge our rapid flight  Beneath the guilty mantle of the night  Still in my arms I little DUFFUS bear  Behind the voice of men and arms we hear  My comrades flyI lay the infant down  And with my guilty life from vengeance run  They found him sav'd him for I knew the voice  It washe said and clos'd at once his eyes  Slowly inclin'd and tumbling headlong down  His guilty life breath'd in a feeble groan"  The mournful monarch stood in dumb surprise  The fate of MALCOLM fill'd afresh his eyes  He folds his arms and bends his silent look  Then starting from the gloom of sorrow spoke  "You see my lords tho' DENMARK'S hostile state  Long sav'd the traitors from the hand of fate  Yet heav'n who rules with equal sway beneath  Snatch'd from her arms a victim due to death  DOVALUS shall not sink among the dead  But with that vengeance hangs o'er treason's head  Still MALCOLM still thou gen'rous and thou best  Thy fate hangs heavy on a brother's breast  You left a young you left a helpless son  But lost to me to SCOTLAND and his throne  Perhaps opprest with hunger and with cold  He 'tends some peasant's cattle to the fold  Or fights a common soldier on the field  And bows beneath the scepter he should wield"  No more he said the noble circle sigh'd  They droop the silent head nor aught reply'd  Now dy'd apace the occidental light  The subject world receives the flood of night  The king from ev'ry side his troops recalls  They fall around and rear their manly walls  He issues to return the great command  They move along and leave the fatal strand  The city gain'd each soldier's weary breast  Forgets the day and sooths his toil with rest  The king receives with hospitable care  The gallant chiefs and drowns in wine the war  Within the royal hall the nobles sat  The royal hall in simple nature great  No pigmy art with little mimickry  Distracts the sense or pains the weary eye  Shields spears and helms in beauteous order shone  Along the walls of uncemented stone  Here all the noble warriors crown the bowl  And with the gen'rous nectar warm the soul  With social talk steal lazy time away  Recounting all the dangers of the day  They turn to ALPIN and the gloomy fight  And tost the gallant warrior of the night  Mean time young ALPIN 'girts the fatal wood  And longs to mix again with DANISH blood  Already HACO had with martial care  With walls of oak embrac'd an ample square  Himself beneath a tree the storm defends  And keeps in arms around his watchful friends  The fair Aurelia by the hero's side  An awful warrior and a blooming bride  Who plac'd in martial deeds her virgincare  Wields in her snowy hand the ashen spear  A silver mail hung round her slender waist  The corslet rises on her heaving breast  On her white arm the brazen buckler shows  The shining helm embrac'd her marble brows  Her twining ringlets flowing down behind  Sung grateful music to the nightly wind  Fate was unkind just as the lovers wed  Nor yet had tasted of the nuptial bed  Great SUENO's trumpet call'd the youth to war  He sigh'd embrac'd and left the weeping fair  With love embolden'd up the virgin rose  From her soft breast the native woman throws  And with the gallant warrior clothes the wife  Following her HACO to the bloody strife  She sought her love thro' war's destructive path  And often turn'd from him the hand of death  The chief attentive all the youth survey'd  And in the warrior found the lovely maid  She leans inclining on her martial spear  And only for the youth employs her fear  The valiant SCOT assails the oaken wall  The bulwark groans the brave defenders fall  With sounding steel the firm barrier he ply'd  And pour'd his warriors in on ev'ry side  The godlike HACO rushing thro' the night  Now here now there oppos'd th' invaders might  To ev'ry corner gave divided aid  Still still supported by the martial maid  Thus when the ocean swelling o'er the strand  Invades with billowy troops the subject land  The sed'lous swains the earthen weight oppose  And fill the fissures where the tempest flows  So valiant HACO flew to ev'ry side  And stemm'd with pointed steel the manly tide  With great effort preserv'd the narrow field  And 'twixt the fair and danger kept the shield  She only she employs the Hero's care  HACO forgot he only thinks on her  He longs to sink with glory to the dead  But can he leave in grief the captive maid  Her dying image hags his fancy's eyes  What shou'd he do if fair AUSELIA dies  Love mighty love arrested all his pow'r  He wish'd for flight who never fled before  But as the lioness to save her young  Despises death and meets the hunterthrong  So starting from the sable maze of care  He faces death and shields the lovely fair  The martial maid with equal love possest  Wou'd dart 'twixt danger and her HACO's breast  Oppose her buckler to the listed spear  And turn from him the iron hand of war  Now godlike AIPIN hew'd his bloody path  Thro' DANISH ranks and mark'd his steps with death  Th' inclosed square with desp'rate hand he shears  And reaps a bloody field of men and spears  Groans crashing steel and clangour of the fight  Increase the stormy chorus of the night  The DANES diminish'd meet th' unequal war  Where two fall'n oaks confine an inner square  Join their broad shields the closewedg'd column rear  And on the SCOTTISH battle turn the spear  On ev'ry side the CALEDONIANS close  Hemming the desp'rate phalanx of the foes  To give the final stroke to battle croud  While HACO thus bespoke the DANES aloud  "Ye sons of North unfortunate tho' brave  Here fate has marked out our common grave  Has doom'd our bodies to enrich these plains  Then die reveng'dlike warriors and like DANES"  He spoke and turning to the martial maid  Embrac'd her softly and thus sighing said  "Shall then my spouse my love my only joy  Shall fair AURELIA with her HACO die  Thy death afflicts meI in vain complain  I'll save AURELLA or expirea DANE"  He said and gath'ring up his spacious shield  Prepar'd to meet the battle in the field  Young ALPIN heardIt touch'd his feeling breast  He stopt the war and thus the DANE addrest  "Our CALEDONIA now reliev'd of fear  Feels pity rising in the place of care  Disdains to tyrannize o'er vanquish'd foes  And for her steel on them her pity throws  I now disiniss brave HACO from the field  And own the gen'rous present of the shield"  He saidhis thanks returns the royal DANE  Himself escorts them to the sounding main  A ship escap'd the flame within a bay  Where bending rocks exclude the rougher sea  Secure from stormy winds in fafety rides  And slowly nods on the recoiling tides  Thither they bend and launching to the sea  Plow with the crooked beak the wat'ry way  Their sable journey to the North explore  And leave their sleeping friends upon the shore  End of  Canto  third  CANTO IV  THE sprightly morn with early blushes spread  Rears o'er the eastern hills her rosy head  The storm subsides the breezes as they pass  Sigh on their way along the pearly grass  Sweet carol all the songsters of the spray  Calm and serene comes on the gentle day  Amidst attendant fair CULENA moves  CULENA fruit of INDULPH's nuptial loves  Too soon to fate the beauteous queen resign'd  But left the image of herself behind  To the calm main the lovely nymphs repair  To breathe along the strand the morning air  They brush with easy steps the dewy grass  Observing beauteous nature as they pass  Th' imperial maid moves with superior grace  Awe mix'd with mildness sat upon her face  High inbred virtue all her bosom warms  In beauty rises and improves her charms  Silent and slow she moves along the main  Behind her maids attend a modest train  Observe her as she moves with native state  And gather all their motions from her gait  Thus thro' IDALIA's balmdistilling grove  Majestic moves the smiling Queen of Love  Her hair flows down her snowy neck behind  Her purple mantle floats upon the wind  The Graces move along a blooming train  And borrow all the gestures of their queen  Thus steal the lovely maids their tardy way  Along the silent border of the sea  Slowcurling waves advance upon the main  And often threat the shore and oft abstain  A woody mound which rear'd aloft its head  Threw trembling shadows o'er a narrow mead  From a black rock crystalline waters leap  Arch as they fall and thro' the valley creep  Chide with the murm'ring pebbles as they pass  Or hum their purling journey thro' the grass  Pleas'd with the scene the wand'ring virgins stood  The main below above the lofty wood  Their eyes they sate with the transporting scene  And sitting press the fairenamel'd green  Enjoy with innocence the growing day  And steal with harmless talk the time away  Mean time fierce CORBRED who preferr'd in vain  His suit to AGNES fairest of the train  Who fled from TWEED to shun his hated arms  Intrusting fair CULENA with her charms  Saw the disdainful nymph remote from aid  And bent his lustful eyes upon the maid  He rush'd with headlong russians from the wood  And seiz'd the fair the virgins shriek aloud  For help for help the struggling virgin cries  And as she shrieks aloud the wood replies  ALPIN alonghis men were sent before  Stalk'd on his thoughtful way along the shore  The distant plaint assail'd the Hero's ear  He drew his sword and rush'd to save the fair  Before the chief the dastard CORBRED fled  And to her brave preserver left the maid  Prostrate on earth the lovely virgin lay  Her roses fade and all her charms decay  In humid rest her bending eyelids close  With slow returns her bosom fell and rose  At length returning life her bosom warms  Glows in her cheeks and lights up all her charms  Thus when invading clouds the moon assail  The landskip fails and fades the shining vale  But soon as CYNTHIA rushes on the sight  Reviving fields are silver'd o'er with light  Th' affrighted fair the gallant warrior leads  To join upon the sand the flying maids  They croud their cautious steps along the sea  Quake at each breath and tremble on their way  Their tim'rous breasts unsettl'd from surprize  To ev'ry side they dart their careful eyes  Thus on the heathy wild the hunted deer  Start at each blast together croud thro' fear  Tremble and look about before behind  Then stretch along and leave the mountainwind  The gallant youth presents the rescu'd fair  Confirms their trembling breasts removes their care  The gen'rous story from herself they hear  And drink his praises with a greedy ear  Steal on the youth their eyes as AGNES spoke  And pour their flutt'ring souls at ev'ry look  But fair CULENA feels a keener dart  It pierc'd her breast and sunk into her heart  She hears attentive views admires and loves  Her eye o'er all the man with pleasure roves  With painsul joy she feels the flame increase  Her pride denies it but her eyes confess  She starts and blushing turns her eye aside  But love steps in and steals a look from pride  Thus fair CULENA struggles up the stream  And 'tempts in vain to quench the rising flame  At length with blushing cheek and bending look  Th' imperial maid the warrior thus bespoke  "O gen'rous chief for thus your deeds wou'd say  How shall our gratitude thy kindness pay  INDULPH shall hear and INDULPH shall reward  Such gen'rous actions claim a king's regard"  She said and thus the chief"Imperial maid  More than the debt thy approbation paid  In this I did not strive with gallant men  Or drive disorder'd squadrons from the plain  But frighted from his prey a sensual slave  The gloomy sons of guilt are never brave  Whoe'er wou'd seize on a defenceless fair  Wou'd shun the sword and fly amain from war"  He said and stalk'd away with manly state  Grandeur with awe commix'd inform'd his gait  His pond'rous mail reflects the trembling day  And all his armour rings along the way  The royal maid observes him as he flies  In silence stands and from her bosom sighs  Slowly moves on before the silent fair  And in the palace shuts her secret care  Mean time young Alpin seeks the king and peers  But fair Culena in his bosom bears  In vain against the rising flame he strove  For all the man dissolv'd at once to love  Within the higharch'd hall the nobles sat  And form'd in council the reviving state  For instant peace solicitous prepare  And raise a bulwark 'gainst the future war  No highflown zeal the patriot hurl'd along  No secret gold engag'd the speaker's tongue  No jarring seeds are by a tyrant sown  Nor cunning senate undermines the throne  To public good their public thoughts repair  And CALEDONIA is the gen'ral care  No orator in pompous phrases shines  Or veils with public weal his base designs  Truth stood conspicuous undisguis'd by art  They spoke the homely language of the heart  Arriv'd the gallant warrior of the night  They hear with eager joy the gloomy fight  His conduct courage and compassion raise  And ev'ry voice is forward in his praise  The great DUMBAR his awsul stature rears  His temples whiten'd with the snow of years  On the brave youth he bends his solemn look  Then turning round thus to the nobles spoke  "Beneath the royal banner SCOTS asar  Had urg'd on Humber's banks the foreign war  My father dead tho' young I took the shield  And led my kindredwarriors to the field  The noble CALEDONIAN camp was laid  Within the bosom of a spacious mead  Greenrising hills encompass'd it around  And these king Malcolm with his archers crown'd  Full on the right a spacious wood arose  And thither night convey'd a band of foes  The kingcommands a chief to clear the wood  And I the dang'rous service claim aloud  I went expell'd the foes and kill'd their lord  And ever since have worn his shining sword  I now retire from war in age to rest  Take it brave youth for you can wield it best"  He said and reach'd the swordThe youth reply'd  Shooting the heavy blade athwart his side  "My lord with gratitude this sword I take  Esteem the present for the giver's sake  It still may find the way it oft explor'd  And glut with hostile blood its second lord  To bloody honour hew its wasteful path  A faithful sickle in the fields of death  He thusWith placid mein great INDULPH rose  And spoke "Thus always meet our Albion's foes  With foreign blood your native arms adorn  And boldly fight for ages yet unborn  For us my lords fought all our godlike sires  The debt we owe to them our race requires  Tho' future arms our country should enslave  She shall acquit our ashes in the grave  Posterity degen'rate as they groan  Shall bless their sires and call their woes their own  Let us my lords each virt'ous spark inspire  And where we find it blow it to a fire  Thy service gallant ALPIN in this war  Shall both be INDULPH's and the senate's care  Mean time with manly sports and exercise  Let us from bus'ness turn the mental eyes  The mind relax'd acquires a double force  And with new vigour finishes the course"  He added not the godlike chiefs obey  All rise at once great INDULPH leads the way  The palace here and there a virid mound  Confine a flow'ry spot of grassy ground  The underrock emerging thro' the green  Chequers with hoary knobs the various scene  Thither repair the chiefs and scepter'd king  And bend upon the plain the hollow ring  Obedient servants from the palace bear  The horny bow the helm the shining spear  The mail the corslet and the brazen shield  And throw the ringing weight upon the field  Imperial INDULPH tow'ring o'er the plain  With placid words address'd the warriortrain  "Let those who bend the stubborn bow arise  And with the feather'd shast dispute this prize  An antique bow a BALEARIAN wore  When Romans thunder'd on our ALBION's shore  The skilful archer dealing death afar  Threw on our Scottish host the distant war  Great FERGUS springs a king devoid of fear  And thro' his body shoots the reeking spear  The bloody spoil thro' striving cohorts brings  And sends this relique down to after kings"  Thus grasping the long bow the monarch said  Rose valiant Grahame and youthful SOMERLED  Next GOWAL in the strife demands a part  Fam'd on his native hills to wing the dart  Full on the mound a helm their aim was plac'd  And GOWAL drew the nerve first to his breast  The bow reluctant yields then backward springs  The nerve resounds thro' air the arrow sings  Close to the aim the earth the arrow meets  And as it vibrates the bright helmet beats  Applause ensuesThe shaft was sent by Grahame  And cut its brazen journey thro' the aim  The prize on him the murm'ring chiefs bestow  Till SOMERLED assumes the antient bow  The dancing chord the leaping arrow left  And rushing took on end Grahame's birchen shalt  Tore on its way around the shivers fly  And SOMERLED brings off the prize with joy  "Who" cries the king "this shield his prize shall bear  And fling with skilful hand the martial spear  Behind this buckler mighty KENNETH stood  When Tay impurpled ran with Pictish blood"  He said and plac'd a mark the knobby round  And measur'd back with equal steps the ground  The valiant Grahame the Mountainyouth arose  Gowal again his martial stature shows  Bent on the knobby splendour of the prize  First from his hand the singing weapon flies  The steelhead mark'd a circle as it run  Flam'd with the splendour of the setting sun  Thus when the night the weeping sky o'erveils  Athwart the gloom the streaming meteor sails  Kindles a livid circle as it flies  And with its glory dazzles human eyes  Thus flew the spear and sinking in the mound  With quick vibrations beat the air around  But miss'd the shieldGrahame's not unpractis'd art  Dismisses thro' the air the murm'ring dart  Full on the middle boss it takes the shield  The fighting metals clatter o'er the field  From the firm knob the point obliquely flies  And on the field the trembling weapon lies  Next valiant ALPIN takes the pond'rous spear  And bending back dismisses it thro' air  The long quick weapon flying o'er the field  Falls on the boss and perforates the shield  The waving shaft is planted on the mound  And with applause the neighb'ring rocks resound  Young SOMERLED wrench'd from the rock a quoit  A huge enormous sharp unwieldy weight  Such nowadays as many panting swains  A witness rear on longcontested plains  Slowbending down at length the hero springs  The rolling rock along the heavens sings  Falling it shakes at once the neighb'ring ground  And on the face of earth indents a wound  Thus when strong winds the aged tow'r invade  And throw the shapeless ruin from its head  It falls and cleaves its bed into the ground  The valley shakes and rocks complain around  All try the mark to reach but try in vain  All falling short unequal wound the plain  ALPIN with diffidence assumes the stone  For such a space had SOMERLED o'er thrown  Th' unwieldy rock a while he weighs with care  Then springing sends it whizzing thro' the air  The wond'ring warriors view it as it rolls  Far o'er the distant mark the discus falls  It shakes the plain and deals a gaping wound  Such as when headlong torrents tear the ground  Th' applauding chiefs own in the manly game  The Hero great as in the fields of fame  CULENA leaning on her snowy arms  Observant from the window points her charms  Th' imperial virgin saw with pleasing pain  The fav'rite youth victorious on the plain  Sadly she sigh'd accusing cruel fate  Which chain'd her in captivity of state  The veil of night had now inwrapt the pole  The feast renew'd goes round the sparkling bowl  Great INDULPH rose with favourspeaking mein  Approaching ALPIN thus the king began  "Say will the stranger tell from whence he came  To reap this harvest of unrivall'd fame  Nobler the youth who tho' before unknown  From merit mounts to virtue and renown  Than he set up by an illustrious race  Totters aloft and scarce can keep his place"  The monarch spokeattentive look the peers  And long to drink his voice with greedy ears  End of  Canto  fourth  CANTOV  THE Hero rising from his lofty seat  Thus unpresumptuously accosts the great  "The fame of DENMARK pass'd our mountains o'er  And fill'd our ears on ABRIA's distant shore  Brave RYNOLD startsthe aged chief alarms  And kindles all his family to arms  A hundred youths who from the sounding wood  Or tow'ring mountain brought their living food  Obey the bagpipe's voice for all in view  Of RYNOLD's seat the friendly Canton grew  The hoary warrior leads the onward path  No stranger to the road which led to death  Behind advancing I with martial care  Lead on the youthful thunderbolts of war  With arms anticipate the kindling fire  And move to ev'ry motion of my sire  "On GRAMPUS night her mantle round us throws  We slept in heaththe dappled morn arose  Descending thence pursue our headlong way  And cross the silver errors of the TAY  Groans feeble shrieks ascending from the vale  Speak on the pinions of the southern gale  A dismal scene breaks on our distant eyes  Here one pursues and there another flies  This breathes his life thro' the impurpled wound  While his proud villa smokes along the ground  That with the foe maintains unequal strife  While his dear offspring fly and dearer wife  "The senior saw it with indignant eyes  And bid at once his kindredranks arise  With hasty steps we seize a virid brow  And form a sable cloud above the foe  Thus on the mountain's brow I oft have seen  The must'ring clouds brew torrents for the plain  At length the blust'ring south begins to roar  And heav'n descends impetuous in a show'r  The bubbling floods foam down the hill and spread  A swimming deluge on the subject mead  "Thus RYNOLD formed on the mountain's brow  And headlong rush'd into the vale below  While on the banks of TAY terrific shine  The steelclad foe and stretch the hostile line  They form a wall along the flowing flood  And awful gleam their arms an iron wood  We shout and rush upon the hostile throng  The echoing fields with iron clangour rung  Firm stood the foe nor made they flight their care  But hand to hand return'd the equal war  Man close to man and shield conjoin'd to shield  They with the stable phalanx keep the field  With pointed spear I mark'd the stoutest foe  And heav'n directed home the happy blow  He tumbles backward to the groaning flood  TAY circles round and mingles with his blood  My kindredyouth their useful weapons wield  Fomenting the confusion of the field  DANE fell on DANE and man transfix'd his man  Till bloody torrents smoak'd along the plain  At length they fly along the banks of TAY  Their guilty leader points th' inglorious way  Eager we followstill the foe with art  Wound as they fly and shoot th' inverted dart  RYNOLD is woundedStill he urg'd the foe  While down his limbs the crimson torrents flow  With eager voice he still foments the strife  Preferring ALBION's liberty to life  "An antient pile uprear'd its rev'rent head  And from its lofty seat survey'd a mead  The mould'ring walls confess'd their beauty past  A fragment falls with each invading blast  Old arms above the gate time's empire own  The rampant lion moulders in the stone  Tall elms around an old and shatter'd band  Their naked arms erect like centries stand  "Within the ruin'd walls their fear inclose  The desp'rate squadrons of the flying foes  An ancient plane whose leafdismantled weight  Rude winds o'erturn'd secures the shapeless gate  On ev'ry side my quick array I form  Prepar'd at once the muniment to storm  Missing my sire I fly to find the chief  And give the wounded all a son's relief  "Far on the plain the wounded warrior creeps  And scarcely moves along his tott'ring steps  But still far as his feeble voice cou'd bear  He kindles with his words the distant war  Quick I approach'dHe first the silence broke  And leaning on his launce the warrior spoke"  "Say why returns young ALPIN from the fight  Pursue the foe and urge the DANISH flight  I sink my son I sink into the grave  You cannot me your country ALPIN save"  No more he saidI mournful thus reply  Compassion melting in my filial eye  O sire the DANES within yon walls secur'd  Will share our pity or must feel our sword  Of filial duty what his wants require  I come to offer for a dying sire"  "He thus returns still good still gen'rous mind  My wants are ALPIN of no earthly kind  The world the fading world retires from view  Earth cloys me now and all it has but you  Go ALPIN go within that lofty wood  A hermit lives a holy man and good  Relieve my son relieve me of my cares  And for the dying RYNOLD raise his pray'rs"  "Thus saidhimself the wounded warrior laid  Within the coolness of a birchen shade  Some youths around employ their friendly care  And o'er the dying shed the mournful tear  Around the antient fastness guards I sent  And to the lofty wood my journey bent  Two rising hills whose brows tall pop'lars grace  With stretching arms a woody plain embrace  Along the treeset vale a riv'let flow'd  And murmur'd softly thro' the underwood  Along the purling stream my steps I bear  And seek the lonely mansions of the seer  Irreg'lar files of tow'ring elms embrace  In their calm bosom an enamel'd space  Full at the end a rock with sable arms  Stretch'd o'er a mossgrown cave a grotto forms  A silver stream clearissuing from the stones  In winding mazes thro' the meadow runs  Depending flow'rs their vary'd colours bind  Hang o'er the entrance and defend the wind  On a green bank the holy seer is laid  Where weaving branches cloud the chequer'd shade  In solemn thought his hoary head's inclin'd  And his white locks wave in the fanning wind  "With rev'rent steps approaching I began  "O blest with all that dignifies the man  Who far from life and all its noisy care  Enjoy'st the aim of all that wander there  Let holy father thy propitious aid  Guide dying RYNOLD thro' the deathful shade"  I saidthe prophet heav'nward lifts his eyes  Long fix'd in solemn thought and thus replies  "Vain mortals worms of earth How can ye dare  To deem your deeds not providence's care  Heav'n looks on all below with equal eye  They long escape but yet the wicked die  With distant time O youth my soul's imprest  Futurity is lab'ring in my breast  Thy blood which rolling down from FERGUS came  Passes thro' time a pure untained stream  ALBION shall in her pristine glory shine  And blest herself bless the FERGUSIAN line  "But ah I see grim treason rear its head  Pale ALBION trembling and her monarch dead  The tyrant wield his scepter 'smear'd with blood  O base return but still great heav'n is good  He falls he falls see how the tyrant lies  And SCOTLAND brightens up her weeping eyes  The banish'd race again resume their own  Nor SYRIA boasts her royal saint alone  Its gloomy front the low'ring season clears  And gently rolls a happy round of years  "Again I see contending chiefs come on  And as they strive to mount they tear the throne  To civil arms the horrid trumpet calls  And CALEDONIA by her children falls  The storm subsides to the calm flood of peace  The throne returns to FERGUS' antient race  Glad CALEDONIA owns their lawful sway  Happy in them in her unhappy they  See each inwrapt untimely in his shroud  For ever sleeping in his gen'rous blood  Who on thy mournful tomb refrains the tear  O regal charms unfortunately fair  Dark FACTION grasps her in his sable arms  And crushes down to death her struggling charms  The rose in all its gaudy liv'ry drest  Thus faintly struggles with the blust'ring west  "Why mention him in whom th' eternal fates  Shall bind in peace the longdiscording states  See SCOT and SAXON coalesc'd in one  Support the glory of the common crown  BRITAIN no more shall shake with native storms  But o'er the trembling nations lift her arms"  He spoke and in the cave inclos'd his age  In wonder lost I leave the hermitage  Measure with thoughtful steps my backward way  While to the womb of night retires the day  Pale doubtful twilight broods along the ground  The forest nods its sleeping head around  Before my eyes a ghastly vision stood  A mangled man his bosom stain'd with blood  Silent and sad the phantom stood confest  And shew'd the streaming floodgates of his breast  Then pointing to the Dome his tardy hand  Thither his eyes my silent way command  He hands my sword emits a feeble groan  And weakly says "revenge me O my son"  I to replyhe hiss'd his way along  As breezes sing thro' reeds their shrilly song  I stood aghast then wing'd me to obey  Across the field I sweep my hasty way  The men I armthe firm barrier we ply  And those who dare dispute the passage die  With dying groans the lonely walls resound  I on the guilty leader deal a wound  Thro' his bright helm the sword its journey takes  He falls and thus with dying accents speaks  "Just heav'n in vain the wicked shun thy pow'r  Tho' late thy vengeance yet the blow is sure  This earth receiv'd the blood from off my hands  A just return my own my own demands  In night's dead hour when all but treason slept  With ruffian bands a bloody train I crept  'Twas here 'twas here oh longdeserved death  'Twas here the godlike man resign'd his breath  The sleeping fam'ly we with blood surprize  And send the palace flaming to the skies  I fled but fled alas pursued by fate  'Tis now I find that I have sinn'd too late  O MALCOLM O my king before my eyes  He stands confestaccurst DOVALUS dies"  His guilty soul in these dire accents fled  I left with hasty steps the silent dead  Beneath the birch my aged sire I found  His life was ebbing thro' the purple wound  On me the aged senior lifts his eyes  And mixes feeble accents with his sighs  "ALPIN the commerce of this world I leave  Convey my reliques to my father's grave  Ten friendly youths the homely rites shall pay  Lead thou the rest my ALPIN to the fray  DENMARK invadesthis was a pilf'ring band  Who spread divided terror o'er the land"  He said a qualm succeeds tears fill my eyes  And woe securely shuts the gates of voice  Silent and sad I hang the dying o'er  And with warm tears intenerate his gore"  The chief resumes"my brave my only son  Yes ALPIN I may call thee all my own  I shall not veil a secret in my death  Take then this story of my latest breath  The twentieth season liv'ries o'er the year  Since on the SEVERN's banks I met the war  In private feud against a SAXON lord  The great DUMBAR had rais'd his kindredsword  I on the foe my bow auxiliar bend  And join afar our fam'ly's antient friend  Returning thence I next the TAY divide  That very night the great King MALCOLM dy'd  My clan in arms might then preserve their king  But Fate withstoodalong in arms we ring  An infant's cries at distance took my ear  I went found thee a helpless orphan there  The king who long infix'd in dumb surprize  Run o'er the speaking youth with searching eyes  Here stopt him short his arms around him flung  And silent on th' astonish'd warrior hung  My son my son at last perplex'd he cries  My DUFFUStears hung in his joyful eyes  The crouding tide of joy his words suppress'd  He clasps the youth in silence to his breast  Th' astonish'd chiefs congeal'd in dumb amaze  Stiffen'd to silence on each other gaze  Sudden their cheeks are vary'd with surprize  And glad disorder darted from their eyes  As when before the swains with instant sound  The forky bolt descending tears the ground  They stand with stupid gaze each other eye  So stood the chiefs oppress'd with sudden joy  At length relax'd from fetters of surprize  "Welcome brave youth" the scepter'd senior cries  "Welcome to honours justly thine alone  Triumphant mount tho' late thy father's throne  To thee with joy the scepter I resign  And waft the kingdom to the coming line"  He said and thus the youth "I only know  To shoot the spear and bend the stubborn bow  Unskill'd to stretch o'er nations my command  Or in the scales of judgment poise a land  Wield still the scepter which with grace you wear  And guide with steadier hand the regal car  While looking up to thee with humble eye  I first transcribe my future rules of sway  Till late enjoy the throne which you bequeath  And only date dominion from thy death"  Resolv'd he spokebursts of applause around  Break on the chiefwith joy the halls resound  As when some valiant youth returns from far  And leaves the fields of death and finish'd war  Whom time and honest scars another made  And friendly hope long plac'd among the dead  At first his sire looks with indifference on  But soon he knows and hangs upon his son  So all the chiefs the royal youth embrace  While joys tumultuous rend the lofty place  While thus the king and noble chiefs rejoice  Harmonious bards exalt the tuneful voice  A select band by INDULPH's bounty fed  To keep in song the mem'ry of the dead  They handed down the ancient rounds of time  In oral story and recorded rhyme  The vocal quire in tuneful concert sings  Exploits of heroes and of antient kings  How first in FERGUS CALEDONIA rose  What hosts she conquer'd and repell'd what foes  Thro' time in reg'lar series they decline  And touch each name of the FERGUSIAN line  Great CARACTACUS FERGUS' awful sword  That bravely lost his country this restor'd  HIBERNIA's spoils GREGORIUS' martial fire  The stern avenger of his murder'd sire  Beneath his sword as yet whole armies groan  And a whole nation paid the blood of ONE  At length descend the rough impetuous strains  To valiant DUFFUS and the slaughter'd DANES  The battle lives in verse in song they wound  And falling squadrons thunder on the ground  Thus in the strain the bards impetuous roll  And quaff the gen'rous spirit of the bowl  At length from the elab'rate song respire  The chiefs remove and all to rest retire  End of  Canto  fifth  CANTO VI  NOW in the blushing east the morn arose  Its lofty head in grey the palace shows  Within the king and valiant chiefs prepare  To urge the chace and wage the mountainwar  The busy menials thro' the palace go  Some whet the shaft and others try the bow  This view'd the toils that taught the horn to sound  Another animates the sprightly hound  For the fleet chace the fair CULENA arms  And from the gloom of sorrow'wakes her charms  The Hero's royal birth had reach'd her ear  And sprightly hope assum'd the throne of care  Around her slender waist the cincture slides  Her mantle flows behind in crimson tides  Bright rings of gold her braided ringlets bind  The rattling quiver laden hangs behind  She seiz'd with snowy hand the polish'd bow  And mov'd before majestically slow  The chiefs behind advance their sable forms  And with dark contrast heighten all her charms  Thus on expanded plains of heavenly blue  Thickgather'd clouds the queen of night pursue  And as they croud behind their sable lines  The virginlight with double lustre shines  The maid her glowing charms thus onward bears  His manly height aside young DUFFUS rears  Her beauty he his manhood she admires  Both mov'd along and fed their silent fires  The HUNTERS to the lofty mountains came  Their eager breasts anticipate the game  The forest they divide and sound the horn  The gen'rous hounds within their bondage burn  Struggle for freedom long to stretch away  And in the wind already scent the prey  At the approaching noise the starting deer  Croud on the heath and stretch away in fear  Wave as they spring their branchy heads on high  Skim o'er the wild and leave the aching eye  The eager hounds unchain'd devour the heath  They shoot along and pant a living death  Gaining upon their journey as they dart  Each from the herd selects a flying hart  Some urg'd the bounding stag a different way  And hung with open mouth upon the prey  Now they traverse the heath and now assail  The rising hill now skim along the vale  Now they appear now leave the aching eyes  The master follows with exulting cries  Fits as he flies the arrow to the string  The rest within the rattling quiver ring  He as they shoot the lofty mountains o'er  Pursues in thought and sends his soul before  Thus they with supple joints the chace pursue  Rise on the hills and vanish on the brow  On the blue heav'ns arose a night of clouds  The radiant lord of day his glory shrouds  The rushing whirlwind speaks with growling breath  Roars thro' the hill and scours along the heath  Deep rolling thunder rumbling from afar  Proclaims with murm'ring voice th' aerial war  Fleet light'nings flash in lawful streams of light  Dart thro' the gloom and vanish from the sight  The blust'ring winds thro' heav'ns black concave sound  Rain batters earth and smokes along the ground  Down the steep hill the rushing torrents run  And cleave with headlong rage their journey on  The lofty mountains echo to the fall  A muddy deluge stagnates on the vale  CULENA mov'd a long the level ground  A hart descends before the op'ning hound  From the recoiling chord she twang'd the dart  And pierc'd the living vigour of the hart  He starts he springs but falling as he flies  Pours out his tim'rous soul with weeping eyes  As o'er the dying prey the huntress sigh'd  Before the wind heav'n pours a sable tide  And lowring threats a storm A rocky cave  Where monks successive hew'd their house and grave  Invites into its calm recess the fair  The rev'rend father breath'd abroad his pray'r  The valiant DUFFUS comes with panting breath  Faces the storm and stalks across the heath  His sleeky hounds a faithful tribe before  Are bath'd with blood and vary'd o'er with gore  Drench'd with the rain the noble youth descends  And in the cave the growling storm defends  Amaz'd astonish'd fix'd in dumb surprize  The lovers stood but spoke with silent eyes  At length the distant colloquy they rear  Run o'er the chace the mountain and the deer  Far from the soul th' evasive tongue departs  Their eyes are only faithful to their hearts  The winding volumes of discourse return  To hostile fields by gallant DUFFUS shorn  Th'imperial maid must hear it o'er again  How fell DOVALUS was by DUFFUS slain  How by the son the father's murd'rer fell  The kindling virgin flames along the tale  She turns she quakes and from her bosom sighs  And all her soul comes melting in her eyes  Flames not unequal all the youth possess  He for the first hears willingly his praise  Praise harshly heard from warriors kings and lords  Came down in balm on fair CULENA's words  The royal pair thus fed the mutual fire  Now speak now pause when both alike admire  He longs to vent the passion of his soul  And she the tempests in her bosom roll  Now he begun but shame his voice opprest  Loth to offend his eyes must tell the rest  At length upon the headlong passion born  He spoke his love and had a kind return  She sigh'd she own'd and bent her modest eyes  While blushing roses on her cheeks arise  Thus on the vale the poppy's blushing head  Brimful of summershow'rs to earth is weigh'd  Fann'd with the rising breeze it slow inclines  While o'er the mead the rosy lustre shines  INDULPH into his cave the hermit led  Found erring thro' the mountains stormy head  CULENA starting as the king appears  Looks ev'ry way and trembles as she fears  On her mild face the modest blushes rise  And fair disorder darted from her eyes  The parentking observ'd the virgin whole  And read the harmless secret in her soul  A while the maze of calm discourse they wind  At length the king unveils his royal mind  "Warded from ALBION's head the storm is o'er  Her prince is found her foes are now no more  Thro' time 'tis ours her happiness to trace  'Tis ours to bind the future bands of peace  Posterity for ALBION's crown may fight  And couch ambition in the name of right  With specious titles urge the civil war  And to a crown their guilty journey tear  I end these fearsthe streams shall run in one  Nor struggling kindred strive to mount the throne  I shield my daughter with young DUFFUS' arms  And bless the warrior with CULENA's charms"  Thus said the king Their willing hands they join  The rev'rent priest runs o'er the rites divine  The solemn ceremony clos'd with pray'r  And DUFFUS call'd his own the royal fair  The storm is ceas'd the clouds together fly  And clear at once the azure fields of sky  The midday sun pours down his sultry slame  And the wet heath waves glist'ring in the bea    The hunter chiefs appear upon the brow  Fall down the hill and join the king below  Slow thro' the narrow vale their steps they bear  Behind advance the spoils of Sylvan war  Far on a headland point condens'd they stood  And threw their eyes o'er ocean's sable flood  Tall ships advance afar their canvassails  In their swoln bosom gather all the gales  Floating along the sable back of sea  Before the wind they cut their spumy way  Bend in their course majestically slow  And to the land their lazy journey plow  Thus spungy clouds on heav'n's blue vault arise  And float before the wind along the skies  Their wings oppos'd to the illustrious sun  Shine as they move majestically on  Thus godlike HAROLD brought his sloating aid  Unknowing SUENO's number'd with the dead  From ANGLIA's coasts he call'd his troops afar  To aid his brother in the foreign war  Arriv'd he in the wave the anchor throws  Attempts to land and ALEION's chiefs oppose  Wave on the fatal shore the pointed spear  And send the arrow whizzing thro' the air  The DANES return the flying death afar  And as they croud away maintain the war  An arrow tore thro' air its murm'ring path  Fell on the king and weigh'd him down to death  Quick from the wound the blood tumult'ous sprung  And o'er the sand the recking weapon flung  Prone on the strand an awful trunk he lies  While sleep eternal steals upon his eyes  The mournful chiefs around the dying stood  Some raise the body others stem the blood  In vain their carethe soul for ever fled  And fate had number'd INDULPH with the dead  CULENA whom young DUFFUS set apart  With a green bank secur'd the hostile dart  Her father's fate assail'd her tender ear  She beat her snowy breast and tore her hair  Frantic along the sand she run she flew  And on the corse distressful beauty threw  She call'd her father's shade with filial cries  And all the daughter streaming from her eyes  Bent on revenge the furious DUFFUS strode  And ey'd with angry look the sable flood  A ship which near had took its nodding stand  Fix'd with the pitchy haulser to the strand  Remains of SUENO's fleet the Hero view'd  And to the mournful warriors spoke aloud  "Let these whose actions are enchain'd by years  Honour the mighty dead with friendly tears  While we of youth descending to the main  Exact severe atonement of the DANE"  He thus and rushing thro' the billowy roars  With brawny arms his rapid journey oars  Divides with rolling chest the ridgy sea  Lashing the bubbling liquid in his way  The boat he seiz'd and meas'ring back the deep  Wafted his brave companions to the ship  The haulser broke unfurl'd the swelling sail  And caught the vig'rous spirit of the gale  Before the sable prow the ocean parts  And groans beneath the vessel as it darts  Now on the foe the SCOTTISH warriors gain  Swells on the approaching eye the floating DANE  Fierce ULRIC's skill brought up the lazy rear  Fam'd in the fields of main to urge the war  Twice seven years in base pursuit of gain  He plow'd the waves the common foe of men  At last to HAROLD aiding arms he join'd  Grasping the spoil with avaricious mind  At first he shoots the leaping shaft afar  And manages with skill the distant war  The chiefs of ALBION with collected might  Bear on the foe and close the naval fight  Deck join'd to deck and man engag'd with man  Sword spoke with sword and SCOT transfix'd his DANE  The smoaking oak is cover'd o'er with gore  If the whole pyratecrew are now no more  The empty hull from wave to wave is tost  Nods as it floats the sport of ev'ry blast  The CALEDONIAN chiefs again pursue  The SCANDINAVIAN fleet o'er ocean flew  T'elude the foe the DANES fly diff'rent ways  And cut with sep'rate prows the hoary seas  Some bear to sea some rush upon the land  And fly amain on earth a trembling band  As in pursuit of doves on rapid wings  The darting hawk thro' air his journey sings  But when the parting flock divides the sky  Hovers in doubt this way or that to fly  So undetermin'd long young DUFFUS stood  At length he sigh'd and thus begun aloud  "While thus O chiefs we urge the flying DINE  Unmourn'd unhonour'd lies the mighty slain  'Tis ours to grace with woe great INDULPH's  And o'er his fallen virtue shed  The warrior spoke the  And with returning prow the waves divide  With swelling sail bring on the fatal shore  Where o'er the dead the aged chiefs deplor  The warriors bear their monarch as they com  In sad procession to the silent tomb  Forsake with lazy steps the sounding main  And move a sad and lamentable train  Behind the dead the tuneful bards appear  And mingle with their elegies the tear  From their sad hearts the mournful numbers flow  In all the tuneful melody of woe  In grief's solemnity CULENA leads  A mournful train of teardistilling maids  Above the rest the beauteous queen appears  And hightens all her beauties with her tears  N  in the tomb the godlike INDULPH laid  Shar'd the dark couch with the illustrious dead  All o'er his grave the mournful warriors sigh  And give his dust the tribute of the eye  Removing as the night inwrapt the sky  They sha  the nuptial  east with solemn joy  e royal DUFFUS with a husband's care  oth'd in his martia  arms the sorrowing fair  O'er ALBION's rocks exerted his command  And stretch'd his scepter o'er a willing land  FINIS
