 THE DESERTER A NEW MUSICAL DRAMA As it is performed at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  DUBLIN Printed for J POTTS D CHAMBERLAINE W SLEATER and R MONCRIEFFE MDCCLXXIII  To the PUBLIC  LE DESERTEUR is well known to have been these five years the most favourite Musical Piece on the French stage so great indeed has been its success that in this short time it has been translated into three languages one of which translations we have lately seen at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket under the title of  Il Desertore  Indeed when you once admit the circumstance of Henry's consessing himself a deserter nothing can be more truly interesting than some of the incidents but yet they were brought about in a way peculiarly calculated for the French stage the resolution of Henry was too sudden too unprepared as well as the circumstance of the mockwedding that precedes it and throughout the piece there were a number of cold inanimating occurrences that had very little if any relation to the main design and add to this it was never intended for an Opera for the author himself calls it a Comedy interspersed with Songs  It was thought therefore that if the unnecessary incidents were expunged and those retained were rendered more probable if  by making an uniform partition between the dialogue and the songs it could be brought more to wear the complexion of an Opera  The Deserter  might be entitled to a favourable reception on the English stage how far these suggestions were reasonable the public who are the best judges and by whose arbitration I shall always be proud to abide will determine  With regard to the Music as I found it a work of great invention I should have kept it in its original state had it been possible but besides the excessive length of the songs the continual breaks into recitative the frequent sudden alterations of the stile and above all that sameness which so particularly characterizes the French Music I found it much too grave to stand the least chance of success in an afterpiece I therefore selected what I thought the beauties and what I could not effect by having recourse to the original I have endeavoured to supply myself  In justice to the French composer I think it absolutely necessary to declare that the songs beginning "  One conduct's for both love and war  " "  The nymph who in my bosom reigns  " "  Mr Simkin I'd have you to know  " and "  The whims of folks in love  " are wholly my own and that the first air in the piece and that beginning "  My life's three parts  diminish'd  " are by Philidor a name of no inconsiderable note in the musical world  I have nothing to add but that I take this opportunity of making my acknowledgments to the performers for the support they were of to this piece I would indeed but that I despair of finding words worthy the occasion express my gratitude to the public for their favourable reception of it  C Dibdin  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HENRY  Mr  Vernon  RUSSET  Mr  Banister  SIMKIN  Mr

other villagers come on with baskets of fruit  AIR I  Simkin  I Can't for my life guess the cause of this fuss  Why there's pipers and fidlers while Robin and Harry  And Clodpole and Roger and ten more of us  Have pull'd as much fruit as we're ably to carry  Margaret  Why numscull that's nothing her ladyship's wine  All over the village runs just like a fouutain  And I heard the folks say every dish when they dine  Will be swimming in claret madeira and mountain  Jenny  Then for poultry and such likegood lord what a store  I saw Goodman Gander six baskets full cramming  Then such comforts and jellies why one such feast more  Would certainly breed in the village a famine  Chorus  What the meaning can be  We shall presently see  For yonder's old Russet who certainly knows  But be what it will  Our wish shall be still  Joy and health to the Duchess wherever she goes  Sim  What can all this feasting be for  Jenny  I'll give you while I wind up this bottom and another and you shan't find it out  Sim  Why then if you know so well why don't you tell us what it is  Jen  Ah I thought you would none of you guess it this grand seasting at the Duchess's is because the King's coming to the camp  Marg  Who told you so  Jen  I had it from Gaffer Russet himself  Sim  Does the King come to the camp today  Marg  Why yes I knew that  Sim  Then as sure as can be I know what will happen  Jen  Why what will happen  Sim  There will be two weddings in the village before tomorrow night  Marg  How so  Sim  Why is not Henry the young soldier to marry Louisa Gaffer Russet's daughter as soon as the review's over  Jen  Not if I can prevent it  Marg  Well that's but one wedding  Sim  Yes but Jenny can tell you whose wedding t'other's to be  Jen  How should I know  Sim  Ah you wont say any thing before folks because you're asham'd  Jen  What do you mean  Sim  As if you did not know  Jen  Not I indeed  Sim  Why did not you promise me that when Henry married Louisa you'd marry me  Jen  Yes yes and I'll keep my word whenever Henry marries Louisa I'll marry you  SCENE II  Rustet Louisa Simkin Margaret Jenny  and Villagers  AIR II  Louisa  Why must I appear so deceitful  I cannot dear father comply  Ah could I think him so ungrateful  With anguish I surely should die  What so tender at parting he told me  Which such joy to my bosom convey'd  When next he was doom'd to behold me  Could I think would be this way repaid  Rus  Well well but child  Lou  Indeed father 'tis impossible I never can consent to such a thing  Rus  Odds heart Louisa there's no harm in it Neighbours come round here I'll tell you the whole affair you know what a dear good lady the Duchess is  Marg  Ah she's a dear good lady indeed and we all of us ought to do every thing she orders us  Rus  I and my family in particular ought for many's the good thing she has given me and my old dame then how kind she was to all my poor children she stood godmother to this and had her christened after her own name  Sim  Louisa  Rus  Well now we come to the point Henry you know who was bred up with my girl and intended from his infancy for her husband is a soldier  Sim  So he is  Rus  And because she has a value for every thing that belongs to me this good lady about three weeks ago sent to the colonel for his discharge that the young folks may live at home at their ease and be as happy as the day is long  Marg  That will be charming and comfortable for you neighbour  Rus  Yes but now comes the mischief of it what has occasion'd it I don't know I never saw any harm of the lad but there are always busy tongues in this village doing people illoffices and such reports within these few days have reached the Duchess's ears that she is determined to see further into this business before she gives Louisa the portion she promised her  Jen  You may thank me for that  Lou  But he'll be here today and so well I know his heart that I am sure he'll clear himself to their confusion who could so vilely traduce him  Jen  Perhaps not  Rus  Well child I am sure you can't wish it more than I do nothing has ever pleas'd me so much as the thought of your coming together I wish to see you married with all my heart for I shall then have nothing to do but to listen to the prattle of your children and prepare myself to follow poor Dorothy  AIR III  My life's three parts diminish'd  And when the sum is finish'd  The parishbell may toll  Gra'mercy on my soul  Ding dong  Swing swong  Methinks my old companions say  That though his hairs are now grown grey  Old  Russet  once upon a day  When all was mirth and jollity  When sports went round and bells did ring  Could briskly dance and blytbe could sing  And then upon the green to see  His rustick feats't was who but he  I'd give this bauble life away  Without a sigh could I but stay  To see a little infant care  Like  Henry  brave  Louisa  fair  Could I see this I'd yield content  A life I hope not badly spent  But as I was telling you the Duchess hearing of these reports is determined that we shall make a trial of his affections  Lou  Indeed father there's no necessity for it he loves me most sincerely  Rus  Nay nay child I really think your love carries you away too much in this affalr it can do no harm 'tis only an innocent frolick you are to make believe as if you were a bride and let me see whooh you shall be the bridegroom  Sim  Shall I I'cod I'm glad of that  Rus  But above all I must instruct you Jenny in your part you are to sit here and tell Henry when he comes that Louisa and Simpkin were married yesterday  Jen  The very thing I wish'd  Lou  I am vex'd to death that this trick should be play'd him I can judge by myself what he'll feel if I was told such a thing of him how miserable I should be  Rus  But he'll be so much the happier when he finds out the deceit child  AIR IV  Louisa  Though prudence may press me  And duty distress me  Against inclination O what can they do  No longer a rover  His follies are over  My heart my fond heart says my  Henry  is true  The bee thus as changing  From sweet to sweet raging  A rose should be light on ne'er wishes to stray  With raptures possessing  In one every blessing  'Till torn from her bosom he flies far away  Rus  Well well dont't make yourself uneasy I dare say he loves you as sincerely as you think he does if so he'll soon be undeceived and we shall finish the day as happily as we could wish in the mean time let us think of what we have to do we are to pretend we came from the church the fiddles and bagpipes are to go first then the lads and lasses follow after which mind this now we are to go to the Duchess's mansion in grand procession and there to be feasted like so many princes and princesses  Sim  I'cod that will suit me nicelyBut Gaffer Russet Jenny says you told her the feasting was to be for the king  Rus  For us and the king yes yes the king after he and his courtiers have had an entertainment at the duchess's goes to review the camp where the soldiers are all to appear under armsAh girls that's what none of you know any thing about when the king goes to the camp then's the timethe drums beatthe fifes playthe colours are flyingandandLordLord what a charming thing war is  Sim  It must be then when one comes home again and its all over  Rus  There's no life like the life of a soldier and then for love let the girls take care of their hearts I remember I won my Dorothy just after I came from such a review now as there may be today  Marg  Ah indeed the soldiers make sad work with young womens hearts sure enough  Rus  And how can it be otherwise  AIR V  One conduct's for  Both love and war  The point's to gain poffession  For this we watch  The enemy's coast  'Till we sleeping catch  Them on their post  Then good b'ye form  The sort we storm  And by these arts  Make towns or hearts  Surrender at discretion  In love the only battery  Which with success we play  To conquer hearts is flattery  No fortress can its power withstand  Neither cannons mortars sword in hand  Can make such way  As 'tis in love so 'tis in war  We make believe  Mislead deceive  Pray what serve drums and trumpets for  Cannons and all our force of arms  But with their thund'ring alarms  To tell not cover our designs  Can these to trenches breaches mines  Blockades or ambuscades compare  No all agree  That policy  Is the true art militaire  But come come we must go and prepare ourselves you have not much time to spare and see where he comes hurrying along there there now he clambers up yonder hillwell done saithAh your lovers have no gout to stop them Come childneighbours come along  Lou  Cruel father  Exeunt  SCENE III  Henry  Afterwards in the wedding procession  Russet Simkin Louisa Margaret Jenny  and Villagers  AIR VI  Henry  The nymph who in my bosom reigns  With such full force my heart enchains  That nothing ever can impair  The empire she possesses there  Who digs for stones of radiant ray  Finds baser matter in his way  The worthless load he may contemn  But prizes still and seeks the gem  But I hear music what can this be All the villagers are coming this wayit seems like a weddingI'll retireHow I envy this couple  Rus  Charming He has hid himselfpretend not to see himdon't turn your head that wayhe's looking at you now  Lou  How cruel not to let me have one look  Sim  No you must look at nobody but me now I am the bridegroom you know  Rus  Jenny be sure you play your part well  Jen  Never fear meMy part's a much more difficult one than they imagine  SCENE IV  Jenny  who sits down to spinning and  Henry  who comes forward during her song  AIR VII  Jenny  Some how my spindle I mislaid  And lost it underneath the grass  Damon advancing bow'd his head  And said what seek you pretty lass  A little love but urg'd with care  Oft leads a heart and leads it far  'Twas passing nigh yon spreading oak  That I my spindle lost just now  His knife then kindly Damon took  And from the tree he cut a bough  A little love c c  Thus did the youth his time employ  While me he tenderly beheld  He talk'd of love I leap'd for joy  For ah my heart did fondly yield  A little love c c  Hen  Good day young woman  Jen  Sings  'Twas passing nigh c  Hen  Young woman  Jen  Sings  'Twas passing nigh c  Hen  Pray tell me what wedding that is  Jen  What that wedding  Hen  Yes  Jen  Do you want to know whose wedding it is  Hen  Ay ay  Jen  What that wedding that went past  Hen  Yes yes  Jen  Why 'tis a wedding in the village here  Hen  But whose I ask you  Jen  Sings  Hen  Are you making a jest of me answer me I beg of you  Jen  Why I do answer you don't I  Sings  Hen  What again Whose is this wedding Whose is it Speak or I'lldid not I see amongst themdistractionwill you answer you  Jen  Lord you are so impatient why then the wedding is Louisa's old Russet's daughter the invalid soldier  Hen  Louisa's wedding  Jen  Yes she was married yesterday  Hen  Married good heavens Are you sure of what you say Do you know Russet  Jen  Do I know him to be sure I do Why he is bailiff to the Duchess What makes you so uneasy you seem as if you had an interest in it  Hen  An interest in it Oh  Jen  Dear me if I remember right you are the young man that every body thought she'd be married to O law what wickedness there is in this world I am sure I very sincerely pity you  Hen  I'm oblig'd to you for your concern  Jen  Nay it is not more upon your account than my own that I am uneasy  Hen  How so  Jen  Why she was not content with making you miserable but she must make me so too the vile wretch she's married to has perjur'd himself for he has sworn a thousand and a thousand times to marry me  Hen  What falsehood and treachery  Jen  If I was you I would not bear it quietly not but she'd brazen it all out for I tax'd her with it myself and she only laugh'd in my face and told me that you and I might go and mourn together like two turtles the loss of our mates  Hen  Insulting creature  Jen  Yes and for my part I said to myself says I 'twould be a good joke to take her at her word but then again I thought that though revenge is sweet yet people have their likings and their dislikings and as for me to be sure I can't pretend to such a good young man as you  Hen  not regarding her  In famous wretch well might she keep her eyes fix'd upon the ground but I'll see her upbraid her with her infidelity and leave her to the guilty reproaches of her own ungrateful heart  Jen  Young man  Hen  Returning  Well what do you say  Jen  I believe you did not rightly hear what I said  Hen  Oh I have no time for trifling  SCENE V  Jenny Simkin  Jen  Poor soul how he takes it to heart but I must follow him for if I lose this opportunity I may not find it so easy to get another But stay upon second thoughts if I can but make a tool of Simkin and by that means alarm Louisa I shall every way gain my ends for if she once believes him capable of slighting her I am sure she has too much spirit ever to see him again  Sim  Oh Jenny I am glad I have found you what do you think brought me away from Louisa and them  Jen  I neither know nor care  Sim  Why I was afraid you'd be jealous  Jen  I jealous  Sim  Why yes you know because I pretended to be Louisa's husband  Jen  No I'd have you to know I am not jealous I am only vex'd to think I have been such a fool to listen to you so long you base creature you  Sim  If I did not think there was something the matter by your looking so cross  Jen  And enough to make one you know I can't help loving you and this is the way you return my affection  Sim  Why you know 'twas only in play  Jen  In playI could see plain enough how your eyes sparkled upon the bare mention of being the bridegroom  Sim  Now Jenny if you would but hear me speak  Jen  Speak get out of my sight you perjur'd wretch I was fool enough not to credit what I heard of you but I dare say 'tis all true  Sim  Why what did you hear of me  Jen  That it was you who invented all these reports about Henry  Sim  Me as I am a living Christian Jenny  Jen  Don't say a word to me you have made me miserable and now you want to insult me  Sim  Indeed I don't you can't think now how happy I could make you if you wou'd only hear me three words  Jen  Don't talk to me of happiness for I never shall be happy again as long as I live  Sim  How dearly she loves me what a pity it is she won't let me clear up this affair  Jen  And then that demure little minx oh I could tear her eyes out I was always afraid of it and now I am convinc'd that her pretended love for Henry was nothing but a contrivance to blind me the easier  Sim  Dear dear  Jen  But however you have both miss'd your aim for Henry behaves as he ought to do and holds her arts in contempt nay he told me himself he had fix'd his affections upon a more worthy object  Sim  He did  Jen  Yes he did and you may go and tell her so and as for me  AIR VIII  Mr  Simkin  I'd have you to know  That for all your fine airs  I'm not at my last pray'rs  Not put to it so  That of course I must take up with you  For I really Sir think that tho' husbands are few  I need not go far off to seek  For a better than you any day of the week  To be sure I must own I was foolish enough  To believe all the tenderness nonsense and stuff  Which for ever you dinn'd in my ears  And when for a while you've been out of my sight  The day has been comfortless dreary the night  And my only companions my tears  But now that's all o'er  I hate you despise you will see you no more  SCENE VI  Sim  Why what the deuce has got hold of her for my share I believe all the folks in our village are gone madmad I'cod I'll be hang'd if any Bedlamites are half so mad as folks in love  AIR IX  The whims of folks in love to know  I believe would fairly pose Old Nick  This moment fastnext moment slow  Now consenting  Now repenting  Nor at this or that will stick  But changing still  They won'tthey will  When they mean Yes they'll answer No  And fume and fret  This hour to get  What they dislik'd an hour ago  If you expect to find them here  To t'other side they quickly vere  The wind and tide  In the same mood will longer bide  Like two fond turtles side by side  This hour they woo  And bill and coo  Then by and by  No reason why  They make the devil and all to do  SCENE VII  A party of Soldiers afterwards  Henry  Sold  I'll tell you my boys how the matter stands if we can but catch hold of him the  summum bonum  of the thing is this he'll be first try'd and then shot  Sold  Yes but suppose we don't catch hold of him  Sold  Why then he'll neither be try'd nor shot  Sold  No more he won't  Sold  But I have been thinking how we shall do to know him  Sold  Ay you are a fool in these matters I'll tell you how you'll know him here here I've got his name and his marks  Reading  Hannibal Firebrand six foot and an inch high of an orange tawney complexion a Roman nose and the letters R T burnt in the palm of his hand the devil's in it if we can miss him  Sold  Well but you need not have taken all this pains for you know he was your pot companion  Sold  Faith I forgot that  Sold  And would you go for to lift your hand against your friend  Sold  Against my friend ay against my father if he was to desert but stay stand by perhaps this is he  They draw back  Hen  Where shall I fly the unhappy have no friends all I meet make a scoff of my sufferings  Sold  It must be him  Sold  Keep back  Hen  Are the inhabitants of this place turned brutes have they no compassion  Sold  There you see how it is none of the people will skreen him they are honest and refuse to do it I'll take care the king shall know what good subjects he has  Hen  At my home where I expected to receive so kind a welcome I am surrounded with enemies  Sold  There there he says he expected to receive a kind welcome from the enemy  Sold  So he does  Hen  To desert one so kind  Sold  Ah 'twas an infamous thing of you sure enough  Hen  Life is not worth keeping upon such terms and this instant could I lay it down with pleasure  Sold  Mark that  Hen  I'll go directly and  Sold  Stopping him  Not so fast if you please hey why this is not the deserter that's my friend but no matter one deserter's as good as another  Hen  Do you suspect me for a deserter  Sold  No we don't suspect you we know you for one  Hen  Me  Sold  Me yes you how strange you make of this matter why did we not hear you confess that you expected a kind welcome from the enemy I'll tell you what I am not fond of making people uneasy but every word you have uttered will be a bullet in your guts  Hen  What if I favour this and so get rid of all my woes at onceOh Louisa you have broke my heart  Sold  What are you talking to yourself about Come come you are a deserter and must go with us  Hen  Shall I or notby heav'n I willI own it I am a deserterlead me where you please  Sold  There he confesses it and we shall have the reward  AIR X  Henry  I'll fly these groves this hated shade  Each sound I hear each thing I see  Remind me thou perfidious maid  Of vows so often made by thee  Blush blush Louisa and look there  Where's now thy truth oh tell me where  Thy constancy's no more  And like a wretch by tempest tost  My peace is gone nay hope is lost  I sink in sight of shore  First and Second Soldier  Come brother come  Third and Fourth Soldier  We must be gone  Henry  Yes yes I'll fly to deathlead on  First Second Third and Fourth Soldier  Come then  Henry  And yet O cruel fate  First Second Third and Fourth Soldier  He's devilish

Yes surely you shall have that here house house I say where the devil are you all But heark'ee friend what a confounded mistake you have made here A mistake damme you have made two mistakes I can prove it In the first place to desert at all was a mistake then to confess it Oh damn it that was a mistake indeed I am but a silly ignorant fellow but had I been in your place had he been my serjeant my general nay my corporal I would have said No I am no deserter No no my lad Skirmish scorns to desert  AIR XI  Though to have a bout at drinking  When I bear the glasses chinking  There's nothing but I'd do or say  Yet  Skirmish  ne'er shall run away  For here is his motto and so there's an end  He's none of your flatt'rers who fawn and are civil  But for country his bottle his king or his friend  Little  Skirmish  would go halfway to the devil  Soldiers often fickle prove  Who can know his mind for ever  We forgive you false in love  But  Deserters  never never  SCENE II  Henry Louisa

the statesman lose his skill  The soldier lawyer and divine  They put strange whims in the gravest skull  And send their wits to gather wool  Then since the world thus runs away  And women and wine  Are alike divine  Let's love all night and drink all day  There's something like a song for you now we'll sing together  Sim  Together  Skir  Ay both together  Sim  But Sir I don't know your song  Skir  Why who the devil wants you to sing my song  Sim  I never saw such a man in my life how shall I get away from himSir  Skir  Well what d'ye say  Sim  I believe there's somebody looking for you

of wretched things like me  A thousand ways our troubles here increase  While care succeeding care destroys our peace  Why fly we then what can such comfort give  We cease to suffer when we cease to live  During the song a messenger comes on and talks with  Flint    Marg  Oh Lord what shall we do I'd give all I have in the world to prevent it  Sim  And for me I'd part with the very cloaths of my

camp assisted in her resolution by her love for you to the astonishment of all who saw her she rush'd like lightning through the ranks made her way to the king himself fell at his feetand after modestly relating the circumstances of thy innocence and her own distress vow'd never to rise till she obtain'd the life of her lover the king having heard her story with that clemency which always accompanies a noble mind granted thy life to her intercession  and the pomp pass'd on amidst the acclamations of the people  Hen  Charming generous creature  Skir  Death and damnation  Fli  Why what ails you Skirmish  Skir  The king at the camp and I not there  Sim  I shall love my cousin Louisa for it as long as I live  Rus  The king wept and the nobles fill'd her lap with money which she threw to the ground least it should retard her in her way to you  Hen  How can I reward such tenderness  Rus  See see here she comes  Lou  My Henry  Falling into his arms  Hen  My Louisa  AIR XIV  Henry  My kind preserver fain I'd speak  Fain wou'd I what I feel express  But language is too poor too weak  To thank this goodness to express  Brothers companions age and youth  Oh tell to all the world her fame  And when they ask for faith and truth  Repeat my dear  Louisa's  name  Louisa  And have I sav'd my  Henry's  life  Dear father in my joy take part  I now indeed shall be a wife  Wife to the idol of my heart  Thus when the storm dispersing flies  Through which the sailor's forc'd to steer  No more he dreads inclement skies  But with the tempest leaves his fear  Russet  Why why I proy you this delay  Children your hands in wedlock join  That I may pass my hours away  In ease and peace through life's decline  This joy's too great my pride my boast  Both both in my affection share  May who delights the other most  Henceforward be your only care  Skirmish  I wish your joy may hold you long  But yet I am not such a sot  As not to see you all are wrong  Why is the king to be forgot  You had been wretched but for him  Then follow  Skirmish  dance and sing  Raise ev'ry voice strain ev'ry limb  Huzza and cry  Long live the King  FINIS
