 VIRGINIA A TRAGEDY  VIRGINIA A TRAGEDY WITH ODES PASTORALS AND TRANSLATIONS  By Mrs  BROOKE  I with Fear  Repeat my Verses to the public Ear  Francis's Horace th Sat st Book  LONDON  Printed for the AUTHOR And sold by A MILLAR in the  Strand  MDCCLVI  TO The Right Honorable THE LADY ELIZABETH CECIL  MADAM  _I Have too great a Respect for your Ladyship's Commands to disobey them even when they contradict my Inclinations and since you are as averse to hear Praise as studious to deserve it I will not offend that delicate Modesty I cannot but admire Indulge me however Madam in the Vanity of saying I had your Ladyship's Permission to prefix your Name to these Papers on Condition  I avoided the usual Style of Dedicators and permit me to add that  I am With the most unfeigned Respect And a Sincerity not always found in Addresses of this Nature  MADAM  Your Ladyship's Most oblig'd Most obedient and Most devoted Servant  FRANCES BROOKE  PREFACE  THE Author of these poetical Attempts begs Leave to say that she should not have printed them but that she is precluded from all Hopes of ever seeing the Tragedy brought upon the Stage by there having been two so lately on the same Subject If her's should be found to have any greater Resemblance to the two represented than the Sameness of the Story made unavoidable of which she is not conscious it must have been accidental on her side as there are many Persons of very distinguished Rank and unquestionable Veracity who saw her's in Manuscript before the others appeared and will witness for her that she has taken no advantage of having seen them She must here do Mr  Crisp  the Justice to say that any Resemblance must have been equally accidental on his part as he neither did nor could see her  Virginia  before his own was play'd  Mr  Garrick  having declined reading her's till Mr  Crisp's  was published  She is sensible of the Danger of appearing in Print and of the many Imperfections in these Pieces but hopes her Sex and the early Time of Li'e at which most of them were wrote will plead her Excuse she asks no more than to be read with the fame Candor and Indulgence with which she herself reads the Productions of others  One thing more she begs Leave to say that she was greatly encouraged to this Publication by the favorable Reception three Odes of her's met with which were inserted in a weekly Paper called  The Old Maid  as this Volume may possibly come into the Hands of Persons who are Strangers to the Paper she has reprinted those Odes with the others  And now invoking the Powers for friendly Gales she ventures to launch her little Bark into the wide Sea of Criticism and  Trembling quits the Shore  By this AUTHOR  Speedily will be published  PROPOSALS For Printing by SUBSCRIPTION A POETICAL

yet be well  Now by my Sister's Shade thy virtuous Mother  I swear the Tyrant shall not force thee from us  Why shou'dst thou fear his Power the Monster dares not  Howe'er he hop'd with Threats to move thy Soul  Attempt to violate a freeborn Virgin  But say Virginia did not Appius try  Each softer Method to seduce thy Virtue  E'er his stern Fury rose to threaten Force  VIRGINIA  O Sir with all the Blandishments of Vice  He first essay'd my Youth With offer'd Power  And Vows of tenderest Passion he protested  That did not his own Law forbid his Purpose  He wou'd divorce the Partner of his Bed  And place me there  NUMITORIUS  His Law The Gods are just  And on himself retort his Insolence  Yes let him sigh for a Plebeian Maid  And sigh in vain by Heaven 'tis righteous Vengeance  But does he talk of Laws He who has broke  Through every sacred Bond Who on Pretence  Of framing Laws has bid them all Defiance  And owns no Obligation but his Will  Is this our Legislator But proceed  Tell me Virginia did he dare to offer  Terms of Disgrace and Shame  VIRGINIA  O Numitorius  Spare my Confusion  NUMITORIUS  I trust Virginia you receiv'd his Love  With all the Pride of Virtue all the Scorn  And strong Resentment of a Roman Maid  Who loves her Honour and her Liberty  VIRGINIA  Yes fired with generous Rage and fierce Disdain  I told him were he free his Law repeal'd  Himself the Son of Jove I wou'd reject  His lawful Vows and think the brave Icilius  Superior to the Tyrant of his Country  NUMITORIUS  How bore he this  VIRGINIA  He stood a Moment speechless  Then his Eyes flaming wild with mad Revenge  And disappointed Love 'Tis well he cry'd  My Power may reach you yet remember Maid  You have not now your Tribunes to protect you  Appius is Lord of Rome then sudden turn'd  And left me dead with Terror for too well  I know his Power and tremble for my Honor  NUMITORIUS  Why was this base Attempt at first conceal'd  VIRGINIA  Alas I fear'd Icilius' Warmth of Temper  I knew his Love and his impatient Spirit  And hop'd my Scorn wou'd cure the Tyrant's Passion  NUMITORIUS  Fear not Virginia soon our Roman Legions  Shall drive these rash Invaderst rembling back  And crown'd with Laurel midst his Fellow Soldiers  Thy Father shall return to join thy Hand  With young Icilius and secure thy Virtue  The holy Marriage Bed the wildest Nations  E'en savage Gauls regard with sacred Awe  But I too long detain thee 'tis the Hour  In which thy gentle Friend the fair Icilia  Expects thy PresenceHa Trebonius here  SCENE II  NUMITORIUS TREBONIUS  NUMITORIUS  WELCOME my dear Trebonius from the Camp  How fares my valiant Brother  TREBONIUS  Well my Friend  If Romans can be well when Slaves to Tyrants  NUMITORIUS  What brings you here  TREBONIUS  Obedience to my Leader  And Shame to see the Roman Legions fly  Cornelius sends by me for fresh Supplies  To stop the conquering Equan Troops Tomorrow  May bring them to these Walls O Numitorius  These Eyes have seen the bravest Sons of Rome  Driven to their very Camp like fearful Fawns  By these oft beaten Equi by the Foes  They once disdain'd nor cou'd my Soul condemn them  Why shou'd they spend their dearest Blood for Appius  NUMITORIUS  For him indeed for to his tow'ring Genius  His Brother Tyrants bend they wait his Nod  And take the Word from him at his Command  They steep their impious Hands in Blood or load  With slavish Chains their freeborn Countrymen  TREBONIUS  Each Hour brings fresh Disgrace our conquering Army  Which pour'd the Tide of Victory along  And like a Torrent overflow'd the Nations  Now ebbs retiring at the slightest Breath  Of Opposition  NUMITORIUS  Gods shall Romans fly  And from the timorous Equi Shall the Stag  The trembling Stag pursue the lordly Lyon  TREBONIUS  O Rome imperial Rome How art thou fallen  Behold the Roman Eagle which e'erwhile  Soar'd with strong Pinion o'er the wondring World  Now spiritless unnerv'd with drooping Wing  Sits languid all its daring Flights forgot  Crush'd by th'oppressive Hand of Tyranny  NUMITORIUS  Yes we are fallen indeed O my Trebonius  I blush to tell thee but this Monster Appius  With brutal Love has dar'd t'insult Virginia  Pledg'd as she is to brave Icilius  TREBONIUS  Gods  Even Sextus stole in secret to Lucretia  Nor thus avow'd his Baseness  SCENE III  NUMITORIUS TREBONIUS a Slave  SLAVE  NUMITORIUS  This Moment as Virginia past the Forum  To visit fair Icilia she was seiz'd  By Claudius Appius' most abandon'd Freedman  Who call'd her Slave and rudely dragg'd her off  To the Tribunal of his Lord I hasted  To tell you this nor know I more that past  NUMITORIUS  To his Tribunal Gods what can it mean  The Tyrant cannot dareO Soldier Friend  Wilt thou assist us Think of brave Virginius  Is't fit his DaughterBut I know thy Virtue  TREBONIUS  No more away my Sword and Arm are yours  SCENE IV  THE  FORUM  APPIUS on his Tribunal twelve LICTORS with Rods and Axes stand rang'd on each Side  VIRGINIA ICILIUS CLAUDIUS Romans  CLAUDIUS  kneels  O gracious Appius  To whom the Injur'd never kneel in vain  To you I bend for Justice this bright Maid  Who long has past for old Virginius' Daughter  Is Daughter of my Slave born in my House  And thence by Fraud convey'd to Numitoria  Who bred her as her own Virginius absent  To hide th' approbrious Curse of Barrenness  This in the Hour of Sickness was confess'd  With penitential Sighs and Tears by her  Who gave her Birth I therefore seiz'd upon her  Nor will resign her but to brave Virginius  If he disprove my Claim since he is absent  From you the Friend of Justice I demand  That she remain with me till his Return  APPIUS  'Tis just nor can I stop the Course of Law  Lictors make Way and let the legal Claimant  Lead off th' unhappy Virgin See Virginius  Be summon'd home to plead his doubtful Right  Be that thy Care Frontinus  To a Lictor  ICILIUS  Impious Villain  And dost thou think I tamely will resign her  No thro' my Bosom you must cut your Way  E'er you can seize this dear this virtuous Maid  Stand off ye Slaves  APPIUS  Ha dost thou thwart my Will  Lictors advance and seize the lawless Traitor  To the Lictors  ICILIUS  Yes Lictors yes prepare your Rods and Axes  Scourge and behead the bravest Sons of Rome  Our fond Credulity which rais'd that Tyrant  Deserves it but let Chastity be safe  O Romans by the sacred Name of Father  By the dear Pleasures of domestick Love  And by the spotless Honour of your Children  Preserve Virginius' Daughter from Pollution  APPIUS  Traitor seditious Villain well I know thee  'Tis not Virginia's Cause awakes thy Rage  The tribunician Spirit breathes within thee  But all thy Arts are vain a Guard attends  To quell the mutinous by Heaven that Roman  Who stops the Course of Justice dies this Moment  SCENE V  APPIUS VIRGINIA ICILIUS CLAUDIUS NUMITORIUS TREBONIUS Romans  NUMITORIUS  WHERE is the Wretch who with unhallow'd Tongue  Demands a freeborn Virgin for his Slave  Sprung from the bravest Blood our City holds  The Numitorii and Virginii join'd  CLAUDIUS  Virginia is my Slave by Justice mine  Nor will I quit Possession till Virginius  Appears to prove his doubtful Right  NUMITORIUS  Fabatus  whispers a Roman who goes out  Thy Slave thou Wretch O Romans see her Tears  Those speaking Drops with strongest Eloquence  Reproach your strange Supineness can it be  Heavens can it be the Daughter of Virginius  Can want a Friend in Rome Ungrateful Men  How has Virginius fought his Country's Battles  For you to guard your Beds from Violation  He rushes foremost in the bloody Field  Whilst youBut Tears prevent meO Virginia  CLAUDIUS  Too late you plead the Laws adjudge her mine  Till her reputed Father proves her Birth  NUMITORIUS  Gods 'tis too much to bear For Pity Appius  If thou hast ought of Man within thee hear me  With me as next of Kindred trust the Maid  'Till this unheard of Claim is prov'd 'twere impious  To trust the Honor of a Roman Virgin  To that abandon'd pandar of Pollution  My Brother may be here by rising Dawn  To morrow I engage for her Appearance  ICILIUS  Why dost thou stoop to supplicate that Tyrant  Assist me generous Romans to secure her  I'll bear her off or perish  TREBONIUS  Brave Icilius  O Romans Countrymen  ALL ROMANS  Liberty Virginia  APPIUS  Hear me ye Romans and thou Numitorius  And judge how I revere the Name of Father  Not to that clamorous tribunician Traitor  Do I yield ought I scorn his idle threats  Scorn him so much I will not even secure him  But to a fancy'd Parent's sacred Sorrows  I yield thus far send for Virginius hither  I will defer my Sentence 'till Tomorrow  But if he then appears not I proceed  Nor longer will withhold th' Award of Justice  Let Sureties instantly be given to Claudius  For her Appearance  SCENE VI  VIRGINIA ICILIUS NUMITORIUS TREBONIUS and Romans  TREBONIUS  ALL are Sureties for her  ROMANS  All  NUMITORIUS  Thanks Romans we may want your Aid Tomorrow  But 'tis not needed now this gallant Friend  With us will be sufficient Come Virginia  Let me conduct thee hence O Romans Friends  Remember But I will not doubt your Virtue  SCENE VII    The House of  VIRGINIUS  NUMITORIUS TREBONIUS  NUMITORIUS  THANKS my Trebonius for this generous Friendship  Thus in our Moments of Distress to aid us  And kindly join in our domestic Dangers  Becomes the honest Roman and the Friend  TREBONIUS  Is not Virginia's Cause the Cause of Rome  Of Liberty and Virtue Too too long  Our stooping Necks have born the Yoke of Power  The Yoke ourselves have fix'd and shall we want  A Deed like this to fire us Gods shall Romans  Wait till Oppression Bondage Violation  In all their horrid Forms are loos'd upon them  E'er they assert the Spirit of their Fathers  And crush the Tyranny themselves have rais'd  NUMITORIUS  For wisest Ends we rais'd this Power Trebonius  To give us Laws the Wonder of the World  From polish'd Greece selected but long since  That Purpose and their trusted Power expir'd  Long have they stretch'd the iron Hand of Force  O'er our insulted Liberties but this  This last Attempt surpasses all Example  TREBONIUS  Yes Numitorius Tarquin's self must yield  The Palm of daring Villainy to Appius  And own him foremost in the wicked Race  But we deserve it Power unlimited  Is only fit for Jove Why did we trust  These Sons of Earth with Thunder much too mighty  For their weak Arms to wield  NUMITORIUS  The giddy Height  To which mistaken Rome has rais'd them turns  Their maddening Brains or Appius would behold  His sure Destruction in this wild Attempt  The Gods are just and tho' unseen to Men  They work our Good from Ill they will I trust  Confound the Tyrant in his own Devices  And make his purpos'd Crime his Punishment  TREBONIUS  They will great Jove beholds him and will lance  The Bolt of Vengeance at his guilty Head  NUMITORIUS  I yet have Hope Trebonius had he dar'd  To use his lawless Power he ne'er had forg'd  This poor Device this Tale of fancy'd Slavery  This crude unlikely Fable of her Birth  Virginius' Presence yet will save his Child  By Morning's earliest Dawn he will be here  In him our Hopes are center'd he alone  Can stem the Torrent of this Tyrant's Passion  Who trembles at his Interest in the Camp  TREBONIUS  His coward Fears I hope are ominous  By brave plebeian honest Deeds Virginius  Has gain'd the Soldiers' Love nor will they see  Howe'er their Spirits droop a Vet'ran wrong'd  I left them ripe for every noble Purpose  Long these Decemvirs have been hateful to them  To this alone is owing our Defeats  They rather chuse to fall beneath the Sword  Than fight for Tyranny  NUMITORIUS  O my Trebonius  My swelling Bosom heaves with Rage indignant  To see the freeborn Sons of mighty Rome  Sunk by their Folly low as basest Slaves  TREBONIUS  Perish the Tyrants Let us hurl this Appius  Down from his black Tribunal and again  Declare for Liberty each Roman Arm  Will grasp a Sword for us  NUMITORIUS  Thou generous Man  TREBONIUS  This Deed is big with Fate Rome's mighty Genius  Tho' now it slumbers will by this arrous'd  Rush like a Whirlwind on these curst Decemvirs  And bear down all before it I will go  And try to wake the godlike Soul of Freedom  In the deluded People Thou Tomorrow  With brave Virginius meet me at the Temple  Of righteous Themis soon as he arrives  SCENE VIII  VIRGINIA ICILIA  VIRGINIA  WELCOME Icilia thou most lov'd of Friends  Let us embrace whilst yet I am a Roman  Tomorrow's fatal Dawn may give me up  The Slave of Claudius when we meet again  It will perhaps be Infamy to clasp me  ICILIA  O my VirginiaBut I cannot speak  Resentment Rage and Indignation rise  And stop my UtteranceArt thou not a Roman  By awful Heaven when Rome was free and glorious  E'er these Decemvirs fix'd their lawless Yoke  Thy Virtue might have been her noblest Boast  VIRGINIA  Alas Icilia we have once been happy  But shall no more canst thou forget the Hours  Of Peace and Innocence we past together  ICILIA  O no Virginia all the dear Delights  Of growing Friendship rush on my Remembrance  When dawning Reason first began to shoot  Each early Hope confect this pleasing End  My Bosom panted for a Counterpart  Some Fellow Mind to soften every Pang  And double Joy by sweet Participation  Amongst the soft Companions of my Youth  I sought a Friend Virginia dear Virginia  Possess'd alone of all our Roman Maids  A Soul susceptive of the social Glow  Dull was each Sport each Pastime lost its Taste  If e'er I mist Virginia from the Train  The gentle Train that shar'd our harmless Joys  VIRGINIA  Yes our first Days were happy smiling Youth  Came on attended by surrounding Pleasures  But Joy to me has been a Prodigal  Who with too lavish Hand dispenc'd her Bounties  And left my riper Days a Prey to Sorrow  ICILIA  Cast back thy Thoughts a Moment my Virginia  To those calm Joys which blest our heedless Youth  How have we sat beneath embow'ring Shades  Whilst the clear Stream in Silence glided by  And lost in sweet romantic Pleasure chid  The dancing Hours that fled too fast away  All then was Peace and Harmony  VIRGINIA  No more  Forbear to wake these tender Images  Remembrance pains me I must now forget  All vanish'd Happiness and fill my Soul  With Horrors equal to my dreadful Fate  I know the Tyrant's Power I know his Passion  And am resolv'd  ICILIA  What meanst thou  VIRGINIA  To be free  To die Icilia thinkst thou I wou'd live  A Prey to Infamy the Slave of Claudius  ICILIA  No my Virginia nor will Appius dare  To sentence thee a Slave e'en midst his Guard  Of riotous patrician Youth he trembles  And fears the Soldiers Vengeance well he knows  The Rank Virginius holds in their Affections  VIRGINIA  Alas Icilia hadst thou seen his Looks  The Looks of mingled Passion and Revenge  With which his fiery Eyes even now survey'd me  Thou wou'dst have trembled for me much I fear  My only Hope of Refuge is the Grave  ICILIA  Where is my Brother Cannot he protect thee  He is the Peoples Darling and may rouse them  To Liberty and Vengeance  VIRGINIA  O Icilia  Thou hast awak'd the Pang that tears my Heart  There I am weak indeed to die is nothing  But O I cannot leave my lov'd Icilius  Our Spring of Love gaybloom'd and promis'd Fruit  Of chaste connubial Bliss when like a Blight  This Ruffian came and wither'd all our Hopes  Thou dearest of Mankind let these Tears witness  The strong the fond Affection of my Soul  ICILIA  The Gods are Friends to Virtue my Virginia  Let us when Morn first paints the ruddy Skies  Summon a Train of Roman Maids and haste  To great Diana's Shrine there kneel and weep  And supplicate the Goddess Aid to save thee  VIRGINIA  Yes I will go Immortal Maid attend  Thou Virgin Goddess to the chaste a Friend  If e'er my Voice amid the tuneful Choir  In Sounds responsive to the breathing Lyre  Has pleas'd thine Ear O take me to thy Care  Regard my Tears and grant my ardent Pray'r  If I must die my spotless Honor save  And let me sink unsullied to the Grave  ACT SECOND  SCENE I    The House of  APPIUS  APPIUS CLAUDIUS  APPIUS  O Claudius what a Whirlwind tears my Soul  In what keen Tortures did I pass the Night  Toss'd by Desire Revenge and Indignation  In vain my Voice invok'd the downy God  The lenient Power regarded not my Prayer  By fierce contending Passions banish'd from me  Long e'er the Dawn I left my restless Couch  To seek thy healing Counsel  CLAUDIUS  Noble Appius  Suspend this Heat a while and lend an Ear  To what my faithful Spies have learnt abroad  This Day must fix you Lord of Rome for ever  Or give the Sway to tribunician Hands  Can you with Tameness yield the Reins of Power  Of Power the noblest Attribute of Jove  To proud Icilius  APPIUS  Curses on the Slave  What dost thou mean my Claudius  CLAUDIUS  Whilst you sit  Supine with folded Arms a sighing Lover  Your haughty Rival gains the giddy People  Horatius and Valerius too have join'd  The abject rebel Multitude forgetful  Meanly forgetful of their noble Birth  APPIUS  Horatius and Valerius I remember  The Insolence with which they crost my Will  Late in the Senate when I call'd the Fathers  To aid me in the Levies for the War  CLAUDIUS  The People worship them the Youths can talk  And make Harangues on ancient Roman Virtue  APPIUS  On Virtue what is Virtue but a Name  Invented by the Wise to shackle Fools  No 'tis Ambition fires them they wou'd raise  Themselves upon my Ruins 'tis for this  They court the Multitude by Arts like these  By feign'd Humility and Shows of Virtue  I gain'd the Power which soon shall make them tremble  They both shall die this Day Icilius too  And Numitorius all shall glut my Vengeance  A chosen Band of noble Youths shall wait  And intercept their Passage from the Forum  CLAUDIUS  If Fortune smiles e'er the revolving Sun  Again shall gild the Capitol I hope  To see you crown'd and hail you King of Rome  APPIUS  O Claudius 'tis to that my Soul aspires  But 'tis not ripe I must delay my Purpose  Fabius commands a Camp of hardy Veterans  'Tis true he yet implicitly obeys me  But 'tis to share my Power and were I once  To aim at Royalty his rous'd Ambition  Wou'd thwart my Will I must secure him first  Perhaps some lucky Chance may do my Work  Wou'd but the coward Troops engage the Foe  Some friendly Sabine Sword might reach his Heart  If not Petilius has my private Orders  To take him off by Poison  CLAUDIUS  Wou'd 'twere done  But can you trust Petilius  APPIUS  With my Life  His Birth illsuited to his desperate Fortunes  First turn'd my Eyes upon him and I found him  Ev'n all I wish'd my powerful Interest rais'd him  To the Decemvirate and well he knows  His Fall with mine involv'd but let this rest  A dearer Care now takes up all my Soul  The bright VirginiaHa what Sound is that  Claudius  goes to the Door and returns    CLAUDIUS  One with Dispatches from the Camp of Fabius  Attends your sacred Will  APPIUS  Conduct him in  SCENE II  APPIUS CLAUDIUS Messenger  APPIUS  WHAT from my valiant Friend your brave Commander  The noble Fabius  MESSENGER  These Dispatches Sir  He begs you will peruse and instant answer  APPIUS  'Tis well attend without  Reads  SCENE III  APPIUS CLAUDIUS  APPIUS  COME hither Claudius  Predition on their coward Souls The Legions  Who basely fled before the seeble Sabines  Have dar'd to brave their Leaders Fabius writes  That when at my Command the Traitor Siccius  Was by a Band of try'd and faithful Soldiers  In private taken off the rebel Troops  No longer own'd their Generals but assembling  In mutinous Consult disclaim'd Obedience  And scarce were held from marching strait to Rome  This Tumult is illtim'd and I cou'd wish  His Death had been defer'd but 'tis no Matter  My Power is fix'd nor fear's their feeble Efforts  CLAUDIUS  Who is their Leader  APPIUS  Labeo the Centurion  Fabius is much too mild the bloody Axe  Must stop this headlong Torrent of Sedition  Their Leader shall be scourg'd and then beheaded  The rest by Decimation learn their Duty  This will not brook Delay prepare my Tablets  Exeunt  SCENE IV    The House of  VIRGINIUS  NUMITORIUS ICILIUS  ICILIUS  WHERE is Virginia Let me once behold her  Whilst yet she is my own whilst she is free  And I without a Blush may own my Passion  NUMITORIUS  She seeks the Help of Heaven by pious Prayer  And much I fear 'tis Heaven alone can save her  ICILIUS  Yes Numitorius while we loitering stand  And hope for Miracles 'tis Heaven alone  That must preserve us all but did we dare  To draw the Sword and pierce the Tyrant's Heart  We better shou'd deserve the Care of Heaven  NUMITORIUS  Patience young Man  ICILIUS  Patience immortal Gods  Does it become the haughty Roman Virtue  Fam'd for swift Vengeance and of Wrongs impatient  Calmly to stand and see our Wives and Children  Dragg'd to Pollution by these homebred Tyrants  O Rome Thou Queen of Nations Shall a Son  A private Citizen by thee entrusted  With delegated Power thus lord it o'er us  Give us our Tarquins Gods if we must stoop  If we must bend beneath the Rod of Power  Let not an Equal fix our galling Chains  NUMITORIUS  You are too warm Icilius  ICILIUS  How Too warm  Is she not mine Heavens are we not betroth'd  O my Virginia may I be a Slave  Doom'd still to bear the Yoke of Tyranny  To crouch beneath the Lash if I not save thee  From this inhuman Monster I will go  And find him out this Moment  NUMITORIUS  Stay Icilius  Your rash Revenge wou'd ruin all our Hopes  Virginius will be here upon the Instant  And when he comes Appius must drop a Claim  He cannot then support Virginia begs  By me she begs you will restrain this Heat  'Till safer Times  ICILIUS  What dost thou mean by Safety  Can we be safe but by the Tyrant's Death  Was it for this our Tribunes were abolish'd  For this our mighty Bulwark of Defence  The sacred Freedom of Appeal remov'd  O Rome misguided People But no more  I will be calm I will await his Sentence  With all the Tameness of a Slave but mark me  If he withdraws not this most impious Claim  My Sword shall find his Heart  NUMITORIUS  It will be just  And Heaven will then approve your righteous  Vengeance  ICILIUS  Gods 'tis too much are then our pleasing Hopes  Of virtuous Happiness untimely blasted  The dear the long expected Hour approach'd  To join our Hands for ever when this Monster  Step'd in between and dash'd our Expectations  But I will save her yes my lov'd Virginia  This Arm shall stab the Tyrant and preserve thee  NUMITORIUS  Fear not Icilius Piety like hers  Is Heaven's peculiar Care nor will the People  Bear with a Deed like this perhaps this Appius  Is but an Instrument of Jove to raise us  From our lethargic State to arm our Hands  With all the Rage of Vengeance and restore  The golden Days of Liberty and Peace  ICILIUS  Be all thy Hopes prophetic Numitorius  And sure the Soul of Rome is lost indeed  If we can bear with an Attempt like this  I will not think we are so vilely sunk  It cannot be  NUMITORIUS  See where Trebonius comes  His hasty Step and unexpected Presence  Since we agreed to meet in Themis' Temple  Bespeak some new Event  SCENE V  NUMITORIUS ICILIUS TREBONIUS  TREBONIUS  WHERE is Virginius  Is he not yet arriv'd The Minutes call  O were he here Rome might again be free  Revenge and Fury burn in every Breast  And if he comes the lawless Tyrant falls  NUMITORIUS  He will be here each Moment I expect him  TREBONIUS  Then tremble Appius on thy proud Tribunal  Each Accident concurs to rouse the People  This Moment from Fidenae is arriv'd  A Soldier who relates that valiant Siccius  Is murder'd by the curst Decemvirs there  By Fabius and the rest who copy Appius  And emulate his blackest Deeds the Camp  Is all in Tumult  ICILIUS  Then the Gods are just  Revenge and glorious Freedom are our own  TREBONIUS  Yes brave Icilius once again the Goddess  Shall spread her shielding Arms round happy Rome  My Soul is all on Fire O Liberty  At thy dear Name my kindling Spirit mounts  And Hope inspires my Breast again I see  Rome's awful Consuls the deliver'd Senate  And thy best Guard the Tribunate restor'd  Again the Roman Eagle spreads his Wings  O'er conquer'd Lands and the fierce Sabine stoops  No more the languid Soldier drooping sits  But wak'd to Valour rushes on the Foe  Resistless in his Course  NUMITORIUS  O Jove alljust  Let thy strong Arm o'ertake these Sons of Rapine  And level them with Earth  TREBONIUS  It wakes my Wonder  That Fabius once the fairest Son of Fame  Belov'd of Rome shou'd join this League of Tyrants  That he whose Courage oft had sav'd his Country  Who stood the foremost in her dear Esteem  Shou'd chuse to sink so low as Appius' Slave  NUMITORIUS  Alas Trebonius Valour is a Crime  If not ally'd to Virtue Liberty  Must guide the righteous Sword or War is Murder  Tho' Fame may follow and the thoughtless People  Applaud yet bravest Deeds deserve our Hate  Deserve our Scorn if prompted by Ambition  TREBONIUS  I tho't this Fabius just as well as brave  I tho't him zealous for his Country's Good  But Tyranny like Virtue sleeping lies  'Till wak'd by Opportunity to Action  NUMITORIUS  Is this the Man who sav'd by mighty Jove  Escap'd the Slaughter of that bloody Day  When but himself the Fabian Race expir'd  Expir'd together fighting for their Country  What Time their single Force oppos'd the Power  The whole united Strength of warlike Veii  TREBONIUS  Look down ye mighty Spirits and behold  The Wretch who shames the noble Fabian Name  And throws a Shade around your Blaze of Glories  Degenerate Man but true Nobility  Is of the Soul nor waits on empty Titles  ICILIUS  Why stand we here and waste the flying Hours  In idle Contemplation Vengeance calls  'Tis now the Time for Action O Trebonius  The coming Hour must give us up for ever  The Slaves of Appius or secure our Freedom  Exeunt  SCENE VI  A Garden  APPIUS CLAUDIUS  APPIUS  O Claudius 'tis in vain to hope for Ease  'Till full Possession cures this fatal Fondness  Each Thought is full of this disdainful Maid  Nor can Ambition's active Fire expel her  Ev'n midst my Schemes of meditated Power  Her bright Idea takes up half my Soul  And mingles with my golden Dreams of Empire  CLAUDIUS  Why will you thus disturb your Soul with Cares  So needless and so vain She must be yours  Sedition's brawling Voice which yesterday  Dar'd to oppose your Will shall sink in Silence  And blooming Beauty crown your warm Desires  APPIUS  Why did my coward Soul consent to yield her  Virginius may return  CLAUDIUS  Think not of him  I trust he is e'er this secur'd in Chains  My Bondman Tyro who convey'd your Orders  Is faithful diligent and more to urge  His swift Dispatch I promis'd Liberty  Shou'd crown his honest Duty if successful  APPIUS  'Tis well I thank thy Care Was it not hard  To have her torn from my fierce rising Wishes  Just when bright Hope had given the Rein to Passion  And Fancy painted all the melting Joys  In her dear yielding Arms O potent Venus  Give me to feast on her luxurious Sweetness  To press her panting Beauties to my Breast  And to thy genial Power shall rise a Temple  In all the proud Magnificence of Greece  CLAUDIUS  Trust me th' approaching Hour shall see her yours  This specious Tale my fervent Zeal inspir'd  Shall give the peevish Virgin to your Arms  Spite of Icilius or the murmuring People  APPIUS  O Claudius with what Dignity she moves  What Magic dwells in that enchanting Form  The Pride of Birth the beauteous Pomp of Power  Look vile before her not the rosy Dawn  Nor vernal Flowers can boast a Bloom like hers  My haughty Soul unus'd to bend yet stoops  To such amazing Beauty nor remembers  The low Plebeian Stock from whence she sprung  I swear that did not conscious Shame forbid  I wou'd repeal my Law divorce Sempronia  And wed this Virgin  CLAUDIUS  Gods what do I hear  Cou'd Appius then the great the highborn Appius  Descended from a Line of matchless Heroes  Who reigns in Rome with more despotic Sway  Than e'er the royal Tarquins dar'd assert  Without a Blush call base Virginius Father  Besides you had forgot Icilius' Claim  The glorious Rival of your Love  APPIUS  The Slave  I had forgot indeed and thou dost well  To wake my keen Disdain my furious Passion  Had hurry'd me to what I blush to think of  To Marriage with this Maid but for thy Counsel  CLAUDIUS  To Marriage with her Yes you do forget  Or Love disturbs your Reason has she not  To you avow'd her Passion for Icilius  Can you so soon forget her haughty Answer  Is she not his To him betroth'd long since  By strictest Vows and stronger Love engag'd  To him to the Plebeian Slave she destines  Those matchless Charms which like the Grecian Helens  Might set the Monarchs of the World in Arms  For Shame shake off this mean this abject Love  And be yourself shall Appius poorly sigh  And waste th' important Hours of doubtful Empire  In whining Boyish Wishes for a Woman  And one within his Power  APPIUS  Forgive my Weakness  Her Scorn distracts my Soul but I deserve it  Why shou'd I ask for what I can command  CLAUDIUS  Why ask indeed Remember Romulus  To what is Rome indebted for it's Greatness  The Sabine Rape  APPIUS  Thou dost instruct me well  I'll seize her snatch her from the Slave she doats on  And force the Joys her foolish Heart denies me  So darting swift th'imperial Bird of Jove  In his strong Talons grasps the trembling Dove  In vain she wou'd resist her feeble Cry  He hears regardless and with conscious Joy  He bears the struggling panting Prize on high  ACT THIRD  SCENE I    The House of  VIRGINIUS  VIRGINIUS  WHAT can this mean In every Face I meet  Sits pale Despair the People gaz'd upon me  With Looks or I mistake of Grief and Horror  Still as I past each Eye was fix'd on me  Dread Silence reigns around o'er all my House  No Sound is heard my Slaves who us'd to fly  With duteous Joy to welcome my Return  Avoid me now My Child too where is she  Sure she is well my Brother's Messenger  Charg'd me to haste to Rome that Business call'd me  Of more Import than Life and that a Moment  Might wreck my Peace for ever O Virginia  Thou art my nearest Care But see my Brother  He will unfold this Riddle  SCENE II  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS  NUMITORIUS  MY Virginius  You come in happy Time to save us all  VIRGINIUS  How fares Virginia  NUMITORIUS  Well but yet my Brother  VIRGINIUS  Why dost thou pause Let me but know the worst  And I will try to bear it like a Roman  The Gods can witness if my Child is safe  All other Griefs are Trifles  NUMITORIUS  O Virginius  She yet is safe but a few posting Hours  May give her up to Shame  VIRGINIUS  Ha what to Shame  By all the Gods of Vengeance tho' I love her  Dearer than Life if she has dar'd to sully  The Honour of her Family this Arm  Shall cut her off and send her to the Grave  Icilius wou'd not sure  NUMITORIUS  O no my Brother  Icilius is a Roman and a brave one  His honest Heart disdains a Thought of Baseness  But the fell Tyrant Appius  VIRGINIUS  Appius she cannot sure be so degenerate  As to prefer the Tyrant of her Country  To brave Icilius but my Sword shall find her  NUMITORIUS  You still mistake me still is your Virginia  The Boast of Roman Maids her Sex's Pride  A Moment's Patience and I will unfold  A Tale shall rouse each Drop of Roman Blood  And set you in a Flame know then Virginius  The fierce Decemvir has with Eyes of Love  Beheld your beauteous Daughter and since all  His Arts of Vice have fail'd to move her Virtue  Has urg'd his base abandon'd Freedman Claudius  To claim her for his Slave  VIRGINIUS  His Slave What mean you  Am I not then a Roman  NUMITORIUS  He pretends  The virtuous Numitoria bought this Maid  Whilst yet an Infant of a female Slave  In Claudius' Family with slow Reluctance  Aw'd by the murmuring People he consented  That till this Morn' his Sentence shou'd be stay'd  Even on the Instant I dispatch'd Fabatus  To bring you from the Camp but lest your Rage  Shou'd force the Story from you I enjoin'd him  Not to relate the Cause for much I fear'd  His Brother Tyrants might detain you there  And all our Hopes are now in your Appearance  VIRGINIUS  Avenging Jove  Let thy red Lightening blast the servile Arm  That lifts a Sword for Appius Let them come  The Foes of Rome I shall with Joy behold them  What can they more than drag our freeborn Virgins  To Bonds and Violation See this Breast  Scarr'd o'er with honest Wounds in Rome's Defence  And think of my Reward my Age's Darling  The lovely Image of my Numitoria  Forc'd from my Arms to sate the brutal Rage  Of a loose Tyrant's Passion but he dares not  He dares not urge so far the Roman Spirit  That waits but for a Deed like this to rise  In all the dreadful Majesty of Vengeance  And crush him at a Blow  NUMITORIUS  There lies my Hope  He fears the Soldiery and well he knows  How much thou art belov'd  VIRGINIUS  O Numitorius  Is it for this the hardy Soldier meets  The Summer's Heat and Winter's piercing Cold  Is it for this he sleeps in open Air  Nor fears the fiery Bolts of angry Jove  That whilst his stubborn Toils preserve his Country  Luxurious Slaves by him from Danger guarded  Shall poison all his dear domestic Peace  The Price and best Reward of fighting Fields  And drag his Children to Pollution Gods  Pour down your keenest Vengeance on my Head  If e'er I draw a Sword for these Decemvirs  NUMITORIUS  No my Virginius for the Time approaches  Which may employ your Sword to better Purpose  The Dawn of Freedom breaks once more on Rome  This base Attempt has rous'd the languid People  Ev'n now they call aloud for Liberty  And urge the Restoration of their Tribunes  VIRGINIUS  Why do we loiter then let us prevent  His lawless Sentence and attack him now  NUMITORIUS  The enterprize is just but full of Danger  He now is guarded by a well arm'd Train  Of rash Patrician Youth nor are the People  Prepar'd for sudden Action let him pass  His wild Decree I trust he will acquit her  O'eraw'd by you but shou'd I judge amiss  Both Gods and Men will then assist your Vengeance  VIRGINIUS  Your Counsel shall prevail but shou'd he doom  My dearest Child a Slave I will preserve her  Ev'n at my Life's Expence Appius or I  Must see the Sun no more but say my Brother  Are all the Senate aw'd by this proud Tyrant  Or do they meanly join in his Oppressions  And share the Spoils of their unhappy Country  Two and two only of Patrician Rank  Espouse the glorious Cause of Liberty  Foes to all Interests but their bleeding Country's  The rest gain'd o'er by Appius aid his Rapines  Or in the Country seek to shun his Power  His noble Uncle Publius Claudius long  Essay'd to bend his haughty Soul to Virtue  But finding all his Counsels vain retir'd  And at Regillum shun's the killing Sight  Of Rome enslav'd and the severe Reflection  That from the Claudian House her Tyrant sprung  VIRGINIUS  And who my Numitorius are the Pair  The noble Pair that join the Cause of Honour  NUMITORIUS  Valerius and Horatius  VIRGINIUS  Gen'rous Youths  Their very Names inspire me tremble Appius  Their Sires expel'd the Tarquins  NUMITORIUS  Yes Virginius  And these brave Youths inherit all the Virtues  The daring Souls of their renown'd Forefathers  Vain the patrician Name if noble Deeds  Speak not the Parent Stock by godlike Virtue  Their Fathers gain'd the Power which these Decemvirs  Abuse to vilest Purposes  VIRGINIUS  Ye Gods  Are these the Men that arrogate all Honours  And scorn Alliance with us But 'tis well  Still let them wed in their own haughty Rank  Nor stain the purer Blood of our Plebeians  NUMITORIUS  And dare they think our bright Plebeian Virgins  Are only born to glut their baser Passions  VIRGINIUS  No more I wou'd repress this rising Rage  'Till fair Occasion calls my Sword to Action  Where is Virginia She was wont to meet me  With all the Haste of filial Piety  Then why appears she not  NUMITORIUS  This very Moment  Attended by a Train of Roman Virgins  She seeks the spotless Shrine of chaste Diana  VIRGINIUS  'Tis well may Heaven reward their pious Prayer  O Numitorius But I will not doubt  The Gods are just and must be Foes to Tyrants  Exeunt  SCENE III  A Garden  APPIUS  HOW slow the Minutes pass my panting Soul  Is sick with Expectation and Desire  Wou'd Claudius were return'd I'll to the Forum  Ascend the Judgment Seat pronounce her Sentence  Then bear her off and lose myself in Bliss  And see he comes  SCENE IV  APPIUS CLAUDIUS  CLAUDIUS  O Appius all is ruin'd  Virginius is return'd  APPIUS  Return'd Thou Traitor  Did'st thou not tell me Tyro's swift Dispatch  Wou'd stop him But ye all are leagu'd against me  Where is the tardy Slave The Cross shall teach him  What 'tis to play with Passions fierce as mine  CLAUDIUS  Tyro is not return'd nor is he guilty  The wily Numitorius from the Forum  Ev'n in the Moment when th' important Cause  Fix'd your Attention unobserv'd dispatch'd  A Messenger to Algidum  APPIUS  'Tis well  By Heaven their forfeit Heads shall pay this Boldness  I'll seize this beauteous Virgin tho' I raise  A Flame to lay imperial Rome in Ashes  And even consume myself  CLAUDIUS  Were it not wiser  To let the furious Tide exhaust it's Strength  E'er you oppos'd it's Rage The People gather  Around Icilius and have sworn to aid him  Virginius Name has rais'd their drooping Courage  They talk of Tribunes threaten to restore  The Freedom of Appeal to bring the Armies  Up to the Walls of Rome and call for Vengeance  On Siccius' Murderers your sacred Life  Will not be safe if you approach the Forum  Defer the Cause you know the giddy Croud  Tomorrow they may think your Sentence just  At least this headlong Heat of Mutiny  Will cool if you oppose it not  APPIUS  O Claudius  I know not what to fix on my Desires  Are now at such a Height as threaten Madness  If not indulg'd they listen not to Reason  And yet thy Words sink deep into my Soul  Where are my brave Patricians  CLAUDIUS  They attend  Your sacred Pleasure in the Campus Martius  Beneath their peaceful Robes all clad in Arms  This Moment haste consult the noble Youths  Fond Love obstructs your Sight and hides from View  The threatening Forms of Danger which surround you  APPIUS  Gods what a Gust of Passion shakes my Frame  Love Empire all that can enflame the Soul  Now fire my Breast O Mars armipotent  By the fierce Joys the Cyprian Queen bestows  By laurel'd Conquest and the grateful Horrors  Of stern relentless War assist thy Votary  Exeunt  SCENE V  The Street  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS  NUMITORIUS  THE Hour of Vengeance is arriv'd my Brother  These thoughtless Tyrants will destroy themselves  They have thrown off the very Mask of Virtue  And given a Loose to every impious Passion  VIRGINIUS  I mourn the valiant Siccius but this Murder  May save my Child that Camp was all I fear'd  The Camp of Fabius for at Algidum  Virginius' Wrongs will not be unreveng'd  NUMITORIUS  This monstrous Cruelty secures them both  And every Sword will now be drawn for Freedom  But see the brave Icilius comes to clasp thee  SCENE VI  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS ICILIUS  ICILIUS  VIRGINIUS here Then Vengeance is our own  VIRGINIUS  And is it thus we meet again Icilius  When last we parted 'twas with other Sounds  I hop'd to greet thee with the Voice of Joy  Of Peace and happy Love this very Hour  The Hour of my Return to Rome I destin'd  Shou'd join thee to my lovely Child  ICILIUS  My Father  Your Presence saves Virginia Life is ours  And generous Liberty the People fir'd  With great Revenge for noble Siccius' Death  And Pity for Virginia swear to die  In our Defence What Hope from Algidum  How stand the Soldiers  VIRGINIUS  Ready for Revolt  But aw'd beneath these curst Decemvir's Power  A Breath wou'd wake them Discontentment walks  Thro' every Rank and my Appearance there  Wou'd raise a Mutiny  Then all is well  And the big Ruin bursts on Appius' Head  NUMITORIUS  Are all our Friends assembled  ICILIUS  All are ready  When we are summon'd to this curst Tribunal  I'm told the Tyrant wavers Fear has seiz'd him  He hastes not to the Forum but amidst  His lawless Counsellors wears out the Hours  And doubts if he shall judge or drop the Cause  NUMITORIUS  Thanks to the gracious Gods  ICILIUS  O Numitorius  Prophetic Fury fires my swelling Breast  I see the Goddess Liberty attended  By all her Train of Joys Domestic Peace  Connubial Love and every home felt Bliss  Around her throng whilst Tyranny appal'd  Shrinks at her awful Presence  VIRGINIUS  Glorious Youth  Thy Words arrouse my Soul and Hope succeeds  The pallid Fear that chill'd me I shall live  To see Virginia happy in thy Arms  To see thee stand the Bulwark of thy Country  Adorn'd with tribunician Power and watchful  For Liberty and Rome  NUMITORIUS  Yes brave Icilius  We shall again be free these strong Forebodings  The Gods ne'er give in vain we yet shall see  Sweet Peace at home and Victory abroad  But shou'd the Tyrant yet relent Virginius  VIRGINIUS  As well thou may'st expect the hungry Lion  To quit his trembling Prey but grant he shou'd  There is a nobler Cause than private Wrongs  The Cause of Rome nor will I sheath my Sword  'Till these Decemvirs fall shame on the Wretch  Unworthy of the glorious Name of Roman  Who safe himself can calmly sit at Ease  The tame Spectator of his Country's Ruin  Dear as I love my Child I swear her Safety  Is but the second Passion of my Soul  ICILIUS  Thou genuine Son of Rome thou greater Brutus  VIRGINIUS  Had Brutus meanly stop'd at private Bliss  The Tarquins yet had tyrannis'd in Rome  Ally'd by Birth he might have shar'd the Spoils  Of his unhappy Country but he scorn'd  To be the first of Slaves and nobly quell'd  Each selfish Passion for the Public Good  Father of Rome he led her on to Safety  Tho' thro' his Children's Blood for well he knew  Freedom or they must perish Ev'n the Gods  Behold with Admiration such firm Virtue  And glory in their own immortal Work  ICILIUS  Thou godlike Man with Wonder I behold thee  And boast with Pride the Title of thy Son  Were not Virginia fair as smiling Spring  Did not the Bloom of op'ning Flowers adorn her  Yet for thy sake to be ally'd to thee  The bravest Sons of Rome had sought her Bed  VIRGINIUS  Thou dost deserve her were she fair as Nature  Fresh from the forming Hands of mighty Jove  O may I live to see a smiling Race  Sprung from this Union crown your nuptial Joys  To see them rise beneath the Shade of Freedom  And copy all thy Virtues May they dare  All Dangers for their Country and when Rome  Demands their Lives with virtuous Pleasure bleed  ICILIUS  The coming Hour is big with great Events  Already Appius totters and your Arm  Is only wanting to compleat his Fall  The God who rules the Thunder's Rage is with us  He wills that all who nobly dare be free  And gives the brave their wellearn'd Liberty  ACT FOURTH  SCENE I  Scene the Inside of the TEMPLE of DIANA at the upper End an ALTAR and STATUE of the GODDESS on the Side Scene the Stories of NIOBE and ACTEON painted  VIRGINIA ICILIA Priestess Train of Virgins  The Priestess stands at the Altar whilst this Hymn is perform'd to solemn Musick  HYMN to DIANA  First VIRGIN  THOU beauteous Goddess of the Grove  From Jove and fair Latona sprung  Bright Offspring of the Thunderer's Love  O be thy Name for ever sung  Ye Virgin Train your tuneful Voices raise  To sing the chaste Diana's deathless Praise  Chorus of VIRGINS  Hail Diana beauteous Maid  Let thy Praise

Pain  And o'er her Infant's pliant Limbs to pour  Health Strength and Swiftness in the natal Hour  Chorus of VIRGINS  Mighty Luna Goddess bright  Bring the beauteous Births to Light  With the blest maternal Name  Crown the sacred nuptial Flame  First VIRGIN  How blest the chosen Train who rove  With thee thro' Erymanthus' Grove  Who dreadful with the pointed Dart  Transfix the tawny Lion's Heart  Or joyous in the cool translucent Wave  Their polish'd Limbs at dewy Evening lave  Chorus of VIRGINS  Virgin Huntress Queen of Night  By thy Crescent's trembling Light  By thy Sports and sylvan Care  Hear O hear our spotless Pray'r  Second VIRGIN  Guardian of the woody Glades  If thy flying Footsteps trace  Algidus' embow'ring Shades  Or Apulia's Forests grace  O haste and bring propitious to our Song  Thy sweet Companion Liberty along  Chorus of VIRGINS  Maid of Groves and Mountains Queen  Leave the peaceful sylvan Scene  And in awful Terrors drest  Pierce the Tyrant's impious Breast  Both

the Scene shuts upon them  VIRGINIA  METHINKS my Soul is more at Ease Icilia  A gentle Calm succeeds the Storm of Passion  Smooth as the Surface of the Lake at Eve  When every Wind subsides  ICILIA  Thanks to the Goddess  Such is the sacred Force of blest Religion  Her Angel Voice can chear the drooping Soul  And drive far off the Clouds of black Despair  VIRGINIA  Behold the Virgins wait Lead on Icilia  SCENE III    The House of  VIRGINIUS  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS  VIRGINIUS  WHAT you relate of Appius' Tyranny  I heard in Part at Algidum 'tis strange  That Rome so long has tamely born the Yoke  Rome NursingMother of a Race of Heroes  Where is the Soul that fir'd our mighty Brutus  Horatius Mutius and the brave Valerius  Was it for this they drove the Tarquins hence  By Actions more than human whilst the Nations  Aw'd by such wondrous Virtue gaz'd at Distance  Nor dar'd to war with Gods in mortal Form  Fought they for Appius Did the generous Father  Doom his own Children to the Ax for him  NUMITORIUS  Virginia comes unhappy lovely Maid  How droop her Charms like vernal Flow'rets bent  Beneath the beating Storm  SCENE IV  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS VIRGINIA  VIRGINIA  MY Father Then the gracious Gods have heard me  Runs to Virginius and kneels  VIRGINIUS  Rise my Virginia O my Child my Child  I thought at my Return to give thee up  To brave Icilius' Arms a virtuous Wife  And not to yield thee to the base Desires  Of thy poor Country's Tyrant Curses blast him  Wou'd not this Face of Innocence and Beauty  Melt even a Tyger's Rage Was it for this  I early train'd thee in the Ways of Honour  And taught thy Soul the virtuous Pride of Rome  VIRGINIA  Alas my FatherBut I cannot speak  If you discard me I am lost indeed  I am your Child ev'n at this Hour I feel  The sacred Force of Nature not Icilius  Brave as he is and worthy of my Choice  Is more belov'd than you  VIRGINIUS  Art thou a Slave  O thou dear Pattern of thy beauteous Mother  Ev'n in that Blush the Blush of kindling Rage  And honest Indignation I can read  The Roman Spirit yes thou art my own  Nor shall the wicked Arm of Power divide us  VIRGINIA  Look on me once again and pity me  By the dear Object of your youthful Transports  Your much lov'd Numitoria by the Joys  Her virtuous Fondness gave you save my Honour  Save me from Bonds and brutal Violation  VIRGINIUS  No more my Child thy Fears unman my Soul  VIRGINIA  Why was I born to wreck my Father's Peace  A barren Bed had blest him O Virginius  Wou'd I had dy'd in Infancy  VIRGINIUS  No more  I cannot bear this Tenderness Virginia  This sudden Gush of Passion quite o'erwhelms me  My Heart is torn with Anguish Parent Nature  Thou art too strong for Reason O my Child  NUMITORIUS  Thy Presence softens him too much Virginia Retire a while  VIRGINIA  Will you then calm his Anguish  Tell him I am not worth this Waste of Grief  SCENE V  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS  VIRGINIUS  NOT worth my Grief Said she not so my Brother  O thou consummate Pattern of all Goodness  What have I left but thee to soften Life  To soothe the painful Hours of feeble Age  And strow with Flowers my Passage to the Grave  NUMITORIUS  Shake off this Grief Virginius steel your Soul  With manly Fortitude shall then a Soldier  Bred in the hardy School of daring Virtue  Shrink at Misfortune's Breath  VIRGINIUS  O Numitorius  What is the Shock of fighting Fields to this  To this keen Throb this tender Pang of Nature  NUMITORIUS  Let us be gone e'er this at Themis' Temple  Our Friends are all assembled and expect us  The mighty Storm is gathering o'er the Tyrants  And ready to descend  VIRGINIUS  Give me a Moment  I must have Time to recollect my Soul  Dispel this Grief and be again a Roman  SCENE VI  VIRGINIA ICILIUS  VIRGINIA  SPITE of thy Courage and my Father's Presence  Spite of th' auspicious Omens from Diana  Hope has forsook my Breast a Damp unusual  Dwells on my Soul and tells me we must part  And part for ever thou most lov'd of Men  May'st thou be happy when my Head is low  For I shall never see thee more Icilius  ICILIUS  Why wilt thou dash our Hopes with these Forebodings  These causeless Fears are not the People ours  Does not the Tyrant's Self confess our Power  By his Delays He hastens not to Judgment  With the fierce Hope that warm'd him Yesterday  But doubtful timid aw'd by brave Virginius  In Consultation wastes the flying Hours  VIRGINIA  Alas Icilius my foreboding Soul  Will not attend to Reason a cold Dew  Hangs on my Limbs and chills my vital Powers  We ne'er shall meet again and yet 'tis hard  When I reflect how we have lov'd Icilius  For Years have lov'd When I remember all  Our Days of chaste Delight whilst Peace and Love  Spread their soft Wings around us I blaspheme  And think the Gods unjust can'st thou forget  When dawning Love first warm'd our youthful Breasts  How I have strove in vain to hide my Fondness  While kindling Blushes told my soft Desires  ICILIUS  Curse on the Tyrant his inhuman Soul  Knows not the Force of Love he never felt  The Doubts the tender dear Anxieties  That wait the soft Affections fierce Desire  Which seeks it's Bliss tho' in it's Object's Ruin  Is all his Breast can know ah how unlike  The gentle anxious Passion which informs  My faithful Bosom My belov'd Virginia  Dost thou remember with what trembling Awe  My Lips first told the tender Tale of Love  So beauteous did'st thou seem so fair beyond  My most aspiring Wish that 'till this Moment  My Flame had inward burnt had not Icilia  With gentle Friendship sooth'd my daring Passion  And nourish'd Hope Why dost thou weep my Love  VIRGINIA  Because 'tis past the Season of Delight  Because the coming Hours are wing'd with Horror  Alas our Joys were but a gaudy Dream  And now we wake to Misery  ICILIUS  Do not weep  We shall be happy yet the smiling Hours  Have still a thousand Joys in Store for thee  VIRGINIA  Wou'd I cou'd hope but 'tis impossible  Despair in all it's Terrors sinks my Soul  Scarce will my Limbs support me O Icilius  Why are the Gods so cruel But no more  I wou'd not damp thy Courage my Despair  Perhaps is only Woman's idle Fears  I love thee my Icilius with such Fondness  As may perhaps encrease my Dread of parting  ICILIUS  Why dost thou talk of parting we shall live  To bless each other yet  VIRGINIA  My trembling Soul  Shrinks at the Thought of Death this softener Love  Has made a Coward of me all my Spirit  My Roman Resolution has forsook me  ICILIUS  Let me once more conjure thee my Virginia  To stifle these illbodings Liberty  This Hour extends her friendly Arm to save thee  And eversmiling Pleasure waits her Train  Revolving Years of Joy and Love attend  To bless thee and reward thy wondrous Virtue  VIRGINIA  I will believe thee I will hope the Gods  Are Friends to Innocence and will protect us  ICILIUS  Thy Words revive my Soul for O Virginia  I cannot see thee weep and be a Man  Give me thy Hand and let me swear upon it  By all the chaste Endearments of our Love  By the past Hours of Peace and Innocence  By Juno Guardian of the Marriage Bed  I love thee more than Life or virtuous Fame  VIRGINIA  Thou will not then forget me when these Eyes  Are clos'd in Death  ICILIUS  Forget thee my Virginia  What dost thou mean  VIRGINIA  If I must die Icilius  Let not another Maid too soon possess  My Place in that dear Bosom give a little  A little Time to Sorrow and Virginia  What have I said O all ye Gods assist him  To bear my Loss with Fortitude Pour down  The Balm of Comfort on his bleeding Soul  For too too well he loves me  ICILIUS  Dost thou think  I wou'd survive thy Loss  VIRGINIA  Thou wou'dst Icilius  Or thou hast never lov'd with streaming Eyes  I here adjure thee by the Love thou bear'st me  By sacred Honour and the Name of Roman  If strong Necessity compels my Death  Live to revenge the lost Virginia's Wrongs  To drive these Tyrants hence and free thy Country  Swear this or by the Majesty of Rome  By awful Jove and that bright Virgin Goddess  Before whose Altar I so lately bow'd  I ne'er will see thee more  ICILIUS  What hast thou said  I swear thenO Virginia cruel Maid  Is this thy Tenderness  VIRGINIA  My Soul is lighter may the gracious Gods  Preserve us for each other But shou'd Fate  Divide us and my dreadful Fears be just  Revenge shall please my Ghost thy Promise spreads  A Gleam of Pleasure round my drooping Heart  My Country too may owe her Peace to me  My Death may shake these Tyrants O Icilius  How poor is Life to this  ICILIUS  Thou virtuous Maid  Talk not of Death Rome shall again be free  And dear Virginia live to share the Blessing  Yes thou shalt live to bless my faithful Arms  To soothe my Pains to soften every Care  And give new Charms to Liberty itself  VIRGINIA  Where is thy Sister my belov'd Icilia  Fain wou'd I see her e'er I go to meet  My dreadful Sentence once again my Soul  Wou'd rest its Sorrows on her friendly Bosom  ICILIUS  I go to seek her she will comfort thee  The Voice of Friendship is the sweetest Balm  For every Woe the Minutes call me from thee  Perhaps I may return with News of Joy  Going  VIRGINIA  Icilius  ICILIUS  My Love  VIRGINIA  Come back and let me feed my Eyes upon thee  Let me once more behold thee e'er thou go'st  Not the fond Mother views her darling Babe  With such strong Tenderness as melts my Soul  At Sight of thee nor do such Fears distract her  When Danger hovers o'er it as my Breast  Feels at the Thought of parting  ICILIUS  Thou soft Blessing  Thou dearest Gift of Heaven no more of parting  Turn all thy Thoughts to Liberty and Love  This very Moment my fond Soul dissolves  With Passion too extreme my Eyes unwearied  Hang on thy lovely Form and lost in Pleasure  Melt with soft Languishment O let me clasp thee  One dear Embrace before we part Virginia  VIRGINIA  My Father here let us avoid his Presence  His Wisdom may condemn this illtim'd Softness  SCENE VII  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS  NUMITORIUS  I wonder much my Brother Appius sent not  To seize you in the Camp 'twas what I fear'd  Tho' from Virginia and our Friends I hid  The sad unpleasing Thought  VIRGINIUS  Thou dost remind me  Of what I had forgot I met a Slave  Hasting to Algidum on Eagle's Wings  The very Ground beneath him seem'd to fly  But all unknowing of this dire Attempt  Almost unmark'd he past me  NUMITORIUS  Heaven assists us  That Messenger was surely sent by Appius  VIRGINIUS  Thanks to the gracious Gods he came too late  But see my Child Wilt thou a Moment leave us  SCENE VIII  VIRGINIUS VIRGINIA  VIRGINIUS  I sought thee my Virginia I wou'd once  Indulge a Parent's Fondness e'er the Hour  The fatal Hour that now too near approaches  VIRGINIA  Why will you melt me thus  VIRGINIUS  My lovely Child  When I remember thy dear dying Mother  My Soul is lost in Anguish yet I see her  She took my Hand and pressing it in hers  With Looks that pierc'd my Soul and Tears that flow'd  In silent Showers unbidden down her Cheek  She falt'ring just pronounc'd My dearest Lord  Be careful of Virginia and expir'd  VIRGINIA  I cannot bear this Softness  VIRGINIUS  Weep not my Child I was to blame to wound  The Sweetness of thy Nature but forgive me  Yes thou hast all thy Mother in thy Face  Her melting Mildness her enchanting Smiles  Chastis'd by Virtue when I look upon thee  I see my Numitoria so she bloom'd  When first she gave her Beauty to my Arms  And can I leave thee to the Tyrant's Rage  No by the Gods of Vengeance I will save thee  From his soul Purpose tho' my Death  VIRGINIA  My Father  What have you said I were a Slave indeed  And Claudius' Claim were just cou'd I submit  To save a worthless Life on such Conditions  No may the Gods with Length of Days and Peace  Bless you when poor Virginia is forgot  By awful Heaven this Dagger's friendly Point  Shall vindicate the Honour of my Race  And save me from Pollution I will show  I am Virginius' Daughter  VIRGINIUS  Mighty Gods  Do Slaves think thus But I must hide my Tears  aside  Give me that Dagger my lov'd Child  VIRGINIA  O Sir  Will you then rob me of my last Resource  Let not the Tyrant triumph o'er my Fame  VIRGINIUS  I will not my Virginia I will use it  In thine and Virtue's Cause on thy Obedience  I charge thee give it  VIRGINIA  Take it and remember  Giving the Dagger  Your Daughter gives her Honour to your Hands  This was her only Pledge of Liberty  VIRGINIUS  I will remember trust thy Father's Care  When did I e'er deny thy just Request  Or when Virginia did'st thou ever ask  What strict enquiring Reason cou'd refuse  Still hast thou been the best most duteous Child  That ever blest a tender Parent's Days  My fond Heart doats upon thee But behold  The brave Trebonius comes He must not see  This soft unmanly Tenderness which shames  My Roman Fortitude and calls me Coward  Retire Virginia and exchange that Garb  Of Peace and Innocence for sable Weeds  Befitting thy unhappy State  SCENE IX  VIRGINIUS TREBONIUS  TREBONIUS  VIRGINIUS  Your Friends expect you  VIRGINIUS  Pardon my Delays  O did'st thou know Virginia's Worth Trebonius  Thou wou'd'st not wonder at a Father's Fondness  The Patriot Soul of Clelia breathes in her  She loves her Country with as warm a Zeal  As e'er inspir'd the noblest Roman Breast  Her filial Goodness too Forgive these Tears  How can I think of such a Loss with Patience  TREBONIUS  You wrong the Gods by this Despair Virginius  Let the fierce Tyrant fear the virtuous Man  Safe in himself can brave the Frowns of Fortune  Like the strong Oak when Clouds the Heavens deform  He fearless stands amidst the hostile Storm  In vain the Rains descend the Torrents rise  In vain fierce Whirlwinds rend the bursting Skies  His firm Foundation all their Rage defies  ACT FIFTH  SCENE I  The Street  APPIUS CLAUDIUS LICTORS  APPIUS  NO more my Heart disdains thy coward Counsels  Shall I then fear Virginius Shall a Slave  A vile Plebeian awe the Soul of Appius  By Heaven I almost scorn myself for doubting  For poorly listening to thy abject Fears  And wasting precious Moments in Delay  CLAUDIUS  If you retreat not certain Death attends you  Sedition fills the Streets  APPIUS  Away thou Coward  The boldest of these Miscreants dread my Frown  Attempt no more to stop my headlong Course  My boiling Blood disdains the Voice of Reason  I can no longer bear these eager Wishes  I will possess her

is a Slave  Yet if thou give Consent that I shall wed her  Claudius at my Request shall drop his Claim  I will this very Hour divorce Sempronia  Espouse this beauteous Maid and raise thee high  Even equal with the noblest Roman Names  VIRGINIUS  Thou raise Virginius Who has given thee Power  To raise a Roman Am I not thy Equal  Free as thyself tho' of Plebeian Race  By Heaven cou'd I forgive Virginia's Wrongs  Yet for this Insolence my hot Revenge  Shou'd even to Death pursue thee  APPIUS  Yet beware  My Rage may rise and crushthee  VIRGINIUS  By the Gods  I almost pity thee Mistaken Man

that  She is no Slave if he accept my Offers  Nay more the noble Fabius shall adopt her  VIRGINIUS  O Villain Shameless Villain wer't thou great  As thy deluded Fancy represents thee  I wou'd disdain wou'd spurn thy base Alliance  And give Virginia to Icilius' Arms  APPIUS  Ha brav'd by thee Then hear me thou fond Father  E'er yonder Sun descends his Western Road  Thou shalt behold Virginia in my Arms  Shalt hear her shrieking call in vain for Help  Whilst I like Rome's great Founder Romulus  With manly Force compress her struggling Beauties  And gratify at once my Love and Vengeance  Then when thy Tongue too late shall curse thy Folly  Death in his foulest Shape shall seize upon thee  Thee and thy Patriot Friends Lead to the Forum  To the Lictors  SCENE III  VIRGINIUS NUMITORIUS

Tyrant  And I am blest wilt thou forgive these Tears  I came to comfort thee but want myself  The Friend I meant to be my Heart is breaking  VIRGINIA  In pity stop these tender Tears Icilia  They wound my Soul perhaps the lawless Tyrant  May yet relent may give me back to Love  And to my weeping Friends perhaps the Gods  By Means we think not of may save my Honour  SCENE V  VIRGINIA ICILIA NUMITORIUS TREBONIUS  TREBONIUS  WHERE is Virginia She is summon'd hence  This very Moment Appius gains the Forum  I saw him pass with hasty Steps he went  He started oft and cast his Eyes around  Then bent them gloomily to Earth and trembled  As if distracted with contending Passions  VIRGINIA  O I shall faint Support me dear Icilia  The dreadful Hour is come where is Icilius  Where is my Father Sure they will not leave me  TREBONIUS  They wait without to guard thee to the Forum  Surrounded by their Friends a Train of Matrons  Attends thee too dismiss thy Fears Virginia  And trust the

lifeless Statues  And gave him Way Icilius rush'd like Fate  To stab the Tyrant but was soon surrounded  Then poor VirginiusO Icilia Here  Grief stops my Tongue  ICILIA  What of Virginius speak  TREBONIUS  He snatch'd her from the Lictor  One last Embrace he cry'd is all I ask  Then wilding casting up his Eyes to Heaven  As if complaining of the careless Gods  He drew a Dagger hid beneath his Robe  And plung'd it in her Bosom thus he cry'd  Thy Father keeps his Word and sets thee free  ICILIA  Cruel inhuman Father  TREBONIUS  How Icilia  What dost thou mean  ICILIA  O pardon good old Man  My frantick Rage and let me curse the Tyrant  Who turn'd thy Sword upon thy Age's Darling  But Death shall free me from this Load of Sorrow  TREBONIUS  No more Icilia poor Despair becomes not  A Roman

shall bleed  Thy offer'd Victims  NUMITORIUS  Mid'st the rising Tumult  A Messenger is seiz'd who bears to Fabius  The Tyrant's Orders to behead brave Labeo  And decimate the Troops this seals them ours  And points their wavering Swords at the Decemvirs  TREBONIUS  Droop not Virginius let Revenge awake you  Revenge and Liberty 'tis Rome that calls  VIRGINIUS  Yes brave Trebonius I obey thy Summons  Sunk as I am beneath this Weight of Sorrow  My bleeding Country shall not call in vain  I will forget the Father in the Roman  Here kneel and swear by all the Gods of Vengeance  By Liberty and by the Soul of Rome  To aid my just Revenge swear on this Dagger  Stain'd with the Blood of Innocence  All ROMANS  We swear  VIRGINIUS  'Tis not for me but for yourselves O Romans  That Freedom bids you wake the glorious Flame  To save your blooming Virgins from Pollution  I have no Interest in these Tyrant's Deaths  What can I lose Alas I have no Daughter    Looking on  Virginia's Body  TREBONIUS  The Moments call why waste we Time Virginius  Fly to the Camp at Algidum and rouse them  To Liberty and Vengeance whilst Icilius  With Numitorius hastens to Fidenae  And fires their Bosoms with the Tyrant's Order  Horatius and Valerius with myself  Will keep alive this Spirit in the City  'Till you by hasty Marches bring the Soldiers  To finish what the People have begun  NUMITORIUS  Tomorrow's rising Dawn shall see our Eagles  Led by Revenge approach the Walls of Rome  O my Trebonius this dear murder'd Maid  This second Lucrece saves her suffering Country  The Ways of Heaven are hid from human Sight  Unsearchable to Man tho' Justice lingers  'Tis but with Rage redoubled to return  And crush the Tyrant who securely sins  Nor deems that Jove beholds his dark Offences  TREBONIUS  From this Event let erring Mortals know  Jove marks their Crimes tho' he withholds the Blow  Black Vengeance rises at his dread Command  Nor sleeps the Thunder in th' Almighty's Hand  O King of Gods still guard the Roman State  Let Death unpity'd on Ambition wait  And every Tyrant meet with Appius' Fate  The END  PASTORALS ODES AND TRANSLATIONS  PASTORALS  PASTORAL I  IN that soft Month when

 That stole my young unpractis'd Soul away  PASTORAL II  PALEMON  AS late to shun the Noonday's scorching Heat  I sought in yonder Grove a cool Retreat  Beneath an Elm around whose Branches twine  The fragrant Woodbine and the curling Vine  Fair Doris sat and in a dying Strain  The lovely Maid accus'd her faithless Swain  Ye wavy Trees ye gently murmuring Springs  Attend to you the wretched Doris sings  Oft have ye heard but now shall hear no more  The melting Vows my perjur'd Damon swore  Here while he sung the Winds forgot to blow  The Leaves to tremble and the Streams to flow  All Nature fix'd in silent Wonder stood  And not a breathing Breeze disturb'd the Wood  This Elm is Witness of my constant Flame  Whose yielding Rhind is pierc'd with Damon's Name  Beneath the Shelter of it's spreading Boughs  My lovely Shepherd breath'd his artful Vows  Here while his trembling Lips his Flame confest  The soft Infection seiz'd my pitying Breast  How sweet with him to trace at early Dawn  The flow'ry Mead or Dewbespangled Lawn  With him at Noon to bait the shining Hook  Where the tall Poplar trembled o'er the Brook  Then smil'd the Grove and smil'd the verdant Plain  But Damon false their Beauties rise in vain  Ah cruel Shepherd tho' my Tongue deny'd  My downcast Eyes were still on Damon's side  Return fair Charmer to thy native Plains  Return and bless me with thy tender Strains  For thee the Meads shall brighter Liveries wear  And studious Nature deck the smiling Year  For thee the Flowers a fairer Bloom disclose  And Odours breath more fragrant from the Rose  Tho' wealthy Daphne larger Flocks may feed  And her's the Herds that graze yon flow'ry Mead  Yet I can boast unrival'd rural Strains  And Charms that fire to Love the sighing Swains  Can sordid Gain my Damon's Bosom move  And what is Wealth Alas to faithful Love  Ah cruel Youth no more my Tongue denies  And Tears are all the Language of my Eyes  While sadly thus her plaintive Numbers flow'd  And Love unfeign'd each tuneful Grace bestow'd  Opprest with Grief she sunk upon the Plain  Like a fair Lilly overcharg'd with Rain  I rais'd the Maid and bore her from the Grove  And curs'd the Shepherd who was dead to Love  ODES  ODE I  To the Muse  BENEATH this close embow'ring Shade  My languid Limbs supinely laid  Thy soft thy gentle Influence brings  A Bliss unknown to Courts and Kings  Not sordid Care's intrusive Power  Nor bleak Misfortune's cruel Hour  Can reach the raptur'd Poet's Breast  Or move the Mind by thee possest  By thee oppressive Want beguil'd  Immortal Homer careless smil'd  And muchwrong'd Sappho cou'd defy  The keener Stings of Calumny  While Care the Miser's Pillow haunts  With Spectres of imagin'd Wants  Thy lenient Power my Soul inspires  With Slumbers calm as my Desires  Yet Ah while thus supremely blest  Poetic Pleasure fills my Breast  Permit O Muse one anxious Sigh  For Britain's drooping Liberty  ODE II  To Sappho  NOT Philomela's liquid Throat  Nor dear Amintor's softer Note  O charmer of the Lesbian Plains  Can equal thy melodious Strains  When in thy bright enchanting Page  I view the tender am'rous Rage  The melting Lines my Bosom move  And all my yielding Soul is Love  And sure thy raptur'd Notes have Art  To melt the stubborn marble Heart  To wake the soft consenting Glow  Ev'n in Amintor's Breast of Snow  If magic Numbers can controul  His native Cruelty of Soul  O bring the silversounding Lyre  To wake the gentle young Desire  Harmonious Songstress I no more  Will Cytherea's Power adore  Since such dissolving Numbers prove  That Sappho is the Queen of Love  ODE III  To Friendship  NO more fond Love shall wound my Breast  In all his Smiles deceitful drest  I scorn his coward Sway  And now with Pleasure can explore  The galling Chains I felt before  Since I am free Today  Today with Friendship I'll rejoice  While dear Lucinda's gentle Voice  Shall soften every Care  O Goddess of the Joy sincere  The social Sigh the pleasing Tear  Thy nobler Bonds I'll wear  When first illfated hapless Hour  My Soul confest Amintor's Power  Lucinda shar'd my Grief  And leaning on her faithful Breast  The fatal Passion I confest  And found a soft Relief  My Steps she oft was wont to lead  Along the fair enamel'd Mead  To soothe my raging Pain  And oft with tender Converse strove  To draw the Sting of hopeless Love  And make me smile again  O muchlov'd Maid while Life remains  To thee I'll consecrate my Strains  For thee I'll tune my Lyre  And echoing with my sweetest Lays  The vocal Hills shall speak the Praise  Of Friendship's sacred

dearest Maid rejoice  Let us fill the sprightly Bowl  And whispering low the favor'd Youth  Commend his Tenderness and Truth  Wherefore does thy fading Cheek  Speak the Doubt the tender Fear  Why that faint Effort to speak  Tell me why that starting Tear  Does Damon slight thy gentle Chain  And sigh for Rhodope again  Ah too plain that streaming Eye  Speaks my lov'd Aminta's Pain  Vain the Voice of festive Joy  Sorrow waits the Lover's Train  Too weak Alas the powerful Bowl  To cure this Sickness of the Soul  ODE VII  On reading the Ode to Wisdom in CLARISSA  LET Carter sing in loftiest Lays  Immortal Wisdom's deathless Praise  Pleas'd to applaud her tuneful Name  My Notes shall join the Voice of Fame  To me the Powers benign decree  A Soul from pining Envy free  That can superior Worth admire  And listen pleas'd to Carter's Lyre  Enough for me that on the Plains  Bright Cecil hears my humbler Strains  Can pining Envy touch the Breast  In Cecil's partial Favor blest  ODE VIII  AWAY nor talk of flow'ry Chains  Of dear Distress and pleasing Pains  But learn this useful Truth from me  That Pleasure dwells with Liberty  Me let the vagrant Muses lead  To wander careless o'er the Mead  Or soft repos'd beside the Stream  To taste the wild poetic Dream  Let glowing Fancy paint the Scene  Of airy Pindus ever green  Around the Delian God in State  Let all his tuneful Servants wait  And see where Sappho sits alone  Her flowing Robe her loosen'd Zone  Th' ambrosial Scents her Locks diffuse  Distinguish well the Lesbian Muse  A rosy Smile o'erspreads her Face  Her Mein assumes a sweeter Grace  She waves her snowy Hand and see  My gentle Lyre she points to thee  She takes she tries my trembling Lyre  And swelling Lo the Notes aspire  She strikes the Strings and all around  Listening Echoes catch the Sound  Ah could the raptur'd Maid impart  To me her sweet harmonious Art  The silver  Nine  A River in Northamptonshire  in softest Strain  Shou'd hear my warbling Lute complain  ODE IX  O thou my lov'd my latest Choice  To whom my riper Vows are paid  Though thoughtless of thy heav'nly Voice  I first the plaintive Strain essay'd  Be thou O Fame my sweetest best Reward  And crown with deathless Bays thy raptur'd Bard  Awhile by Sappho's Numbers fir'd  I touch'd the languid Lesbian String  But now by thee arrous'd inspir'd  Of nobler Themes I burn to sing  Of godlike Britain's Liberty and Laws  And Heroes bleeding in her beauteous Cause  So wanders wild the gen'rous Steed  In wanton Youth of Ease possest  Serene he crops the flow'ry Mead  No thought of Glory fires his Breast  But when he hears the Trumpet's Sound from far  His Soul dilates and swelling pants for War  O beauteous Liberty for thee  The Rhine's unhappy Exiles roam  Forc'd by a Tyrant's hard Decree  To quit their dear paternal Home  By thee Helvetia's barren Mountains smile  Nor envy fair Campania's fruitful Soil  Nor be my weaker Sex deny'd  To breathe the glorious Patriot Strain  Since we can boast with pleasing Pride  The Virgin Queen's triumphant Reign  When Tyranny forsook th'enfranchis'd Land  And Freedom rose beneath a female Hand  With Freedom rose her genuine Train  The Statesman wise the letter'd Sage  The laurel'd Bard the Chieftain plain  And own'd a new Augustan Age  Around the great Eliza's dreaded Throne  Victorious Essex Drake and Raleigh shone  Then blameless Walsingham arose  At once his Queen's and Country's Friend  Skill'd to discern their lurking Foes  And from the secret Dart defend  And deathless Bacon's comprehensive Soul  Of boundless Science grasp'd th'amazing whole  But see to guide the golden Reins  Of Empire mighty Burghley rise  He pours forth Plenty o'er the Plains  Calm steady uncorrupted wise  O sacred Shade accept the grateful Lay  Each British Voice must to thy Virtues pay  Then too the favor'd Muses smil'd  And sporting on the Banks of Thame  Strongfancy'd Spencer Shakespear wild  And Sydney hail'd Eliza's Name  Then manly Johnson's justly pictur'd Page  And humorous Fletcher's shook the laughing Stage  O might those glorious Days return  Wou'd Statesmen fir'd by Burghley's Name  With ancient British Ardor burn  Scorn selfish Views and pant for Fame  Again our conquering Arms shou'd Gallia weep  And Albion reign triumphant o'er the Deep  Prophetic Lo my raptur'd Mind  Beholds as rolling Minutes move  A PatriotMonarch  The Author wou'd not be misunderstood as meaning any Disrespect to a Name for which she has the greatest Veneration all she meant was to express the Hopes almost universally conceiv'd at the Time this Ode was wrote of a most amiable Prince who dy'd not long after lamented by a whole People and like Titus left behind him the Character of the Friend of Human kind  who shall find  His Safety in his People's Love  Unbrib'd around his grateful Subjects stand  While base Corruption blushing leaves the Land  Then o'er Britannia's beauteous Isle  Shall Peace and Arts together rise  Encourag'd by the royal Smile  Shall future Homers reach the Skies  Each modest Muse shall raise her drooping Head  Nor pine neglected in the barren Shade  But whither fir'd wou'd Fancy rove  And
