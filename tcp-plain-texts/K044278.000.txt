 THE School for Wives  A COMEDY  AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON PRINTED FOR T BECKET IN THE STRAND  PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE  PREFACE  THE Author of the following performance cannot commit it to the press without acknowledging the deepest sense of gratitude for the uncommon marks of approbation with which he has been honoured by the Public  Tho' he has chosen a title us'd by MOLIERE he has neither borrowed a single circumstance from that great poet nor to the best of his recollection from any other writerHis chief study has been to steer between the extremes of sentimental gloom and the excesses of uninteresting levity he has some laugh yet he hopes he has also some lesson and fashionable as it has been lately for the wits  even with his friend Mr Garrick at their head to ridicule the Comic Muse when a little grave he must think that she degenerates into farce where the grand business of instruction is neglected and consider it as a heresy in criticism to say that one of the most arduous tasks within the reach of literature shou'd when executed be wholly without utility  The Author having been presumptuous enough to assert that he has not purloin'd a single sprig of bays from the brow of any other writer he may perhaps be ask'd if there are not several plays in the English language which before his produced Generals Lawyers Irishmen Duels Masquerades and Mistakes He answers yes and confesses moreover that all the Comedies before his were compos'd not only of men and women but that before his the great business of comedy consisted in making difficulties for the purpose of removing them in distressing poor young lovers and in rendering a happy marriage the object of every catastrophe  Yet tho' the Author of the School for Wives pleads guilty to all these charges still in extenuation of his offence he begs leave to observe that having  only men and women to introduce upon the stage he was oblig'd to compose his Dramatis Personae of mere flesh and blood if however he has thrown this flesh and this blood into  new  situations if he has given a  new  fable and plac'd his characters in a point of light hitherto unexhibitedhe flatters himself that he may call his play a  new  play and tho' it did not exist before the creation of the world like the famous Welch pedigree that he may have some small pretensions to originality  Two things besides the general moral inculcated thro' his piece the Author has attempted the first to rescue the law as a profession from ridicule or obliquy and the second to remove the imputation of a barbarous ferocity which dramatic writers even meaning to compliment the Irish nation have connected with their Idea of that gallant peopleThe law like every other profession may have members who occasionally disgrace it but to the glory of the British name it is well know that in the worst of times it has produced numbers whose virtues reflected honour upon human nature many of the noblest privileges the constitution has to boast of were derived from the integrity or the wisdom of lawyers  Yet the stage has hitherto cast an indiscriminate stigma upon the whole body and laboured to make that profession either odious or contemptible in the theatre which if the laws are indeed dear to good Englishmen can never be too much respected in this kingdom There is scarcely a play in which a lawyer is introduced that is not a libel upon the long robe and so ignorant have many dramatic writers been that they have made no distinction whatever between the characters of the first Barristers in WestminsterHall and the meanest solicitors at the Old Bailey  With respect to the gentlemen of Ireland where even an absolue attempt is manifested to place them in a favourable point of view they are drawn with a brutal promptitude to quarrel which is a disgrace to the well known humanity of their countryThe gentlemen of Ireland have doubtless a quick sense of honour and like the gentlemen of England as well as like the gentlemen of every other highspirited nation are perhaps unhappily too ready to draw the sword where they conceive themselves injuredBut to make them proud of a barbarous propensity to Duelling to make them actually delight in the effusion of blood is to fasten a very unjust reproach upon their general character and to render  them universally obnoxious to society The author of the School for Wives therefore has given a different picture of Irish manners though in humble life and flatters himself that those who are really acquainted with the original will acknowlege it to be at least a tolerable resemblance  It would be ungrateful in the highest degree to close this preface without acknowleging the very great obligations which the author has to Mr Garrick Every attention which either as a manager or as a man he could give to the interest of the following play he has bestowed with the most generous alacrity but universally admired as he is at present his intrinsic value will not be known till his loss is deplored and the public have great reason to wish that this may be a very distant event in the annals of the theatre The Epilogue sufficiently marks the masterly hand from which it originated so does the comic commencement of the Prologue and the elegant writer of the graver part is a character of distinguished eminence in the literary republic  It has been remarked with great justice that few new pieces were ever better performed than  The School for Wives  Mr King that highlydeserving  favourite of the town was every thing the author could possibly wish in General Savage Mr Reddish acquired a very considerable share of merited reputation in Belville Mr Moody is unequalled in his Irishmen Mr Palmer from his manner of supporting Leeson was entitled to a much better part And Mr Weston in Torington was admirable Miss Younge in Mrs Belville extorted applause from the coldest auditor Her tendernessher forceher pathos were the true effusions of genius and proved that she has no superior where the feelings are to be interested With respect to Mrs Abington enough can never be said The elegance the vivacity the critical nicety with which she went through Miss Walsingham is only to be guessed at by those who are familiar with the performance of that exquisite actress Her Epilogue was delivered with an animation not to be conceived and manifested the strict propriety with which she is called the first priestess of the Comic Muse in this country  Jan    THE SCHOOL FOR WIVES BEING A COMEDY IN WHICH THE LADIES ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IT SHOULD BE ADDRESS'D TO THE FIRST ORNAMENT OF THE SEX AND IS THEREFORE INSCRIBED WITH THE HIGHEST ADMIRATION AND THE MOST PROFOUND REVERENCE TO HER MAJESTY NOT BECAUSE SHE IS THE GREATEST OF QUEENS BUT BECAUSE IN THE MILDER AND MORE ENDEARING RELATIONS OF LIFE SHE IS THE BRIGHTEST PATTERN OF ALL THE FEMALE VIRTUES  January    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr KING  NO coward he who in this critick age  Dares set his foot upon the dang'rous stage  These boards  like Ice your footing will betray  Who can tread sure upon a slipp'ry way  Yet some thro' five acts slide with wond'rous skill  Skim swift along turn stop or wind at will  Some tumble and get up some rise no more  While cruel criticks watch them on the shore  And at each stumble make a hellish roar  A wise Philosopher hath truly noted  His name I have forgot tho' often quoted  That finespun spirits from the slightest cause  Draw to themselves affliction or applause  So fares it with our BardLast week he meets  Some hawkers roaring up and down the streets  Lives characters behaviour parentage  Of some who lately left the  mortal  stage  His ears so caught the sound and work'd his mind  He thought his own name floated in the wind  As thus"Here is a faithful true relation  "Of the birth parentage and education  "Last dying speech confession character  "Of the unhappy malefacterer  "And comick poet  Thomas Addle Brain  "Who suffer'd  Monday  last at Drury Lane  "All for the price of halfpenny a piece"  Still in his ears these horrid sounds encrease  Try'd and condemn'd half executed too  There stands the culprit 'till repriev'd by you  Enter Miss YOUNGE  Miss YOUNGE  Pray give me leave  I've  something now to say  Mr KING  Is't at the  School for Wives  you're taught this way  The  School for Husbands  teaches to obey  Exit  Miss YOUNGE  It is a shame good Sirs that brother  King  To joke and laughter should turn every thing  Our frighted poet would have no denial  But begs me to say something on his trial  The School for Wives  as it to us belongs  Should for our use be guarded with our tongues  Ladies prepare arm well your brows and eyes  From those your thunder these your light'ning flies  Should storms be rising in the Pitlook down  And still the waves thus fair ones with a frown  Or should the Galleries for war declare  Look upyour eyes will carry twice as far  The conclusion of the Prologue from this line is by another hand  Our Bard to noble triumphs points your way  Bids you in moral principles be gay  Something he'd alter in your education  Something which hurting  you  would hurt a  nation  Ingenuous natures wish you to reclaim  By smiling virtue you'll insure your aim  That  gilds with bliss the matrimonial hours  And blends her laurels with the sweetest flowers  Ye married fair deign to attend our school  And without  usurpation  learn to rule  Soon will he cease mean objects to pursue  In conscience wretched till he lives to you  Your charms will reformation's pain beguile  And  vice  receive a stab from every  smile  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  CAN  it be thought ye wives this scribbling fool  Will draw you here by calling you to  School  Does not he know poor soul to be directed  Is what you hate and more to be corrected  Long have these walls to public fame been known  An  ancient College  to instruct the town  We've  Schools  for  Rakes  for  Fathers Lovers Wives  For naughty girls and boys to mend their lives  Where some to yawn some round about to look  Some to be seen few come to mind their book  Some with high wit and humour hither run  To sweat the mastersand they call it fun  Some modish sparks true stoicks and high bred  Come but ne'er know what's done or sung or said  Should the whole herd of criticks round them roar  And with one voice cry out  encore encore  Or louder yet  off off no more no more  Should Pit Box Gall'ry with convulsions shake  Still are they half asleep nor t'other half awake  O ladies fair are these fit men to wed  Such husbands  half  had better be  quite  dead  But to returnvain men throughout the nation  Boast they alone have  College  education  Are not we qualify'd to take degrees  We've  caps  and  gowns  nay  bands  too if you please  Cornelly's  and  Almack's  our  Universities    Young female students rise if girls of parts  From under graduates  mistresses of arts  The bashful spinsters turn important spouses  Strive to be  masters  and the  heads of houses  Will any of you here blest with a wife  Dispute the factyou dare not for your life  Pray tell me truly criticks and be free  Do you this night prefer the  Wife  to  me  Shall  Mrs Belville  give the Play a name  What are her merits a cold smiling dame  While I a salamander liv'd in flame  Press'd by  three  lovers'twas indeed provoking  Ladies upon my word it was no joking  Can you from mortal woman more require  Than save her fingers and yet play with fire  The risks I

Well Miss Walsingham this fury is going what a noble peal she has rung in Belville's ears  Miss  WAL  Did she see you Captain Savage  CAPT  No I took care of that for tho' she is'n't married to my father she has ten times the influence of a wife and might injure me not a little with him if I didn't support her side of the question  Miss  WAL  It was a pleasant conceit of Mr Belville to insinuate the poor woman was disordered in her senses  CAPT  And did you observe how the termagant's violence of temper supported the probability of the charge  Miss  WAL  Yes she became almost frantic in reality when she found herself treated like a madwoman  CAPT  Belville's affected surprise too was admirable  Miss  WAL  Yes the hypocritical composure of his countenance and his counterfeit pity for the poor woman were intolerable  CAPT  While that amiable creature his wife implicitly believed every syllable he said  Miss  WAL  And felt nothing but pity for the accuser instead of paying the least regard to the accusation But pray is it really under a pretence of getting the girl upon the stage that Belville has taken away Mrs Tempest's neice from the people she boarded with  CAPT  It is Belville ever on the look out for fresh objects met her in those primitive regions of purity the GreenBoxes where discovering that she was passionately desirous of becoming an actress he improved his acquaintance with her in the fictitious character of an Irish manager and she eloped last night to be as she imagines the heroine of a Dublin theatre  Miss  WAL  So then as he has kept his real name artfully conceal'd Mrs Tempest can at most but suspect him of Miss Leeson's seduction  CAPT  Of no more and this only from the description of the people who saw him in company with her at the play but I wish the affair may not have a serious conclusion for she has a brother a very spirited young fellow who is a council in the Temple and who will certainly call Belville to an account the moment he hears of it  Miss  WAL  And what will become of the poor creature after he has deserted her  CAPT  You know that Belville is generous to profusion and has a thousand good qualities to counterbalance this single fault of gallantry which contaminates his character  Miss  WAL  You men you menYou are such wretches that there's no having a moment's satisfaction with you and what's still more provoking there's no having a moment's satisfaction without you  CAPT  Nay don't think us all alike  Miss  WAL  I'll endeavour to deceive myself for it is but a poor argument of your sincerity to be the confidant of another's falsehood  CAPT  Nay no more of this my love no people live happier than Belville and his wife nor is there a man in England notwithstanding all his levity who considers his wife with a warmer degree of affection if you have a friendship therefore for her let her continue in an error so necessary to her repose and give no hint whatever of his gallantries to any body  Miss  WAL  If I had no pleasure in obliging you I have too much regard for Mrs Belville not to follow your advice but you need not enjoin me so strongly on the subject when you know I can keep a secret  CAPT  You are all goodness and the prudence with which you have conceal'd our private engagements has eternally oblig'd me had you trusted the secret even to Mrs Belville it wou'dn't have been safe she wou'd have told her husband and he is such a rattleskul that notwithstanding all his regard for me he wou'd have mention'd it in some moment of levity and sent it in a course of circulation to my father  Miss  WAL  The peculiarity of your father's temper join'd to my want of fortune made it necessary for me to keep our engagements inviolably secret there is no merit therefore either in my prudence or in my labouring assiduously to cultivate the good opinion of the General since both were so  ecessary  to my own happiness don't despise me for this acknowledgement now  CAPT  Bewitching softnessBut your goodness I flatter myself will be speedily rewarded you are now such a favourite with him that he is eternally talking of you and I really fancy he means to propose you to me himself for last night in a few minutes after he had declared you would make the best wife in the world he seriously ask'd me if I had any aversion to matrimony  Miss  WAL  Why that was a very great concession indeed as he seldom stoops to consult any body's inclinations  CAPT  So it was I assure you for in the army being used to nothing but command and obedience he removes the discipline of the parade into his family and no more expects his orders shou'd be disputed in matters of a domestic nature than if they were deliver'd at the head of his regiment  Miss  WAL  And yet Mrs Tempest who you say is as much a storm in her nature as her name is disputing them eternally  Enter Mr and Mrs  BELVILLE  BEL  Well Miss Walsingham hav'n't we had a pretty morning's visitor  Miss  WAL  Really I think so and I have been asking Capt Savage how long the lady has been disordered in her senses  BEL  Why will they let the poor woman abroad without some body to take care of her  CAPT  O she has her lucid intervals  Miss  WAL  I declare I shall be as angry with you as I am with Belville  aside to the Captain  Mrs  BEL  You can't think how sensibly she spoke at first  BEL  I should have had no conception of her madness  if she hadn't brought so preposterous a charge against me  Enter a Servant  SER  Lady Rachel Mildew Madam sends her compliments and if you are not particularly engaged will do herself the pleasure of waiting upon you  Mrs  BEL  Our compliments and we shall be glad to see her Ladyship  Ex Servant  BEL  I wonder if Lady Rachel knows that Torrington came to town last night from Bath  Mrs  BEL  I hope he has found benefit by the waters for he is one of the best creatures existing he's a downright parson Adams in good nature and simplicity  Miss  WAL  Lady Rachel will be quite happy at his return and it would be a laughable affair if a match could be brought about between the old maid and the old bachelor  CAPT  Mr Torrington is too much taken up at WestminsterHall to think of paying his devoirs to the ladies and too plain a speaker I fancy to be agreeable to Lady Rachel  BEL  You mistake the matter widely she is deeply smitten with him but honest Torrington is utterly unconscious of his conquest and modestly thinks that he has not a single attraction for any woman in the universe  Mrs  BEL  Yet my poor aunt speaks sufficiently plain in all conscience to give him a different opinion of himself  Miss  WAL  Yes and puts her charms into such repair whenever she expects to meet him that her cheeks look for all the world like a rasberry ice upon a ground of custard  CAPT  I thought  Apollo  was the only god of Lady  Rachel's idolatary and that in her passion for poetry she had taken leave of all the less elevated affections  BEL  O you mistake again the poets are eternally in love and can by no means be calculated to describe the imaginary passions without being very susceptible of the real ones  Enter Servant  SER  The man Madam from Tavistockstreet has brought home the dresses for the masquerade and desires to know if there are any commands for him  Mrs  BEL  O bid him stay till we see the dresses  Ex Servant  Miss  WAL  They are only Dominos  BEL  I am glad of that for characters are as difficult to be supported at the masquerade as they are in real life The last time I was at the Pantheon a vestal virgin invited me to sup with her and swore that her pocket had been pick'd by a Justice of peace  Miss  WAL  Nay that was not so bad as the Hamlet's Ghost that box'd with Henry the Eighth and afterwards danc'd a hornpipe to the tune of Nancy Dawson Ha ha haWe follow you Mrs Belville  Exeunt  Scene changes to  LEESON  's Chambers in the Temple  Enter  LEESON  LEES  Where is this clerk of mine Connolly  CON  behind  Here Sir  LEES  Have you copied the marriage settlement as I corrected it  CON  Enters with pistols  Ay honey an hour ago  LEES  What you have been trying those pistols  CON  By my soul I have been firing them this half hour without once being able to make them go off  LEES  They are plaguy dirty  CON  In troth so they are I strove to brighten them up a little but some misfortune attends every thing I do for the more I clane them the dirtier they are honey  LEES  You have had some of our usual daily visitors for money I suppose  CON  You may say that and three or four of them are now hanging about the door that I wish handsomely hang'd any where else for bodering us  LEES  No joking Connolly my present situation is a very disagreeable one  CON  Faith and so it is but who makes it disareeable your Aunt Tempest would let you have as much money as you please but you won't condescend to be acquainted with her though people in this country can be very intimate friends without seeing one anothers faces for seven years  LEES  Do you think me base enough to receive a favour from a woman who has disgraced her family and stoops to be a kept mistress you see my sister is already ruin'd by a connection with her  CON  Ah Sir a good guinea isn't the worse for coming through a bad hand if it was what would become of us lawyers and by my soul many a high head in London would at this minute be very low if they hadn't recieved favours even from much worse people than kept mistresses  LEES  Others Connolly may prostitute their honour as they please mine is my chief possession and I must take particular care of it  CON  Honour to be sure is a very fine thing Sir but I don't see how it is to be taken care of without a little money your honour to my knowledge has'n't been in your own possession these two  years and the devil a crum can you honestly swear by till you get it out of the hands of your creditors  LEES  I have given you a licence to talk Connolly because I know you faithful but I hav'n't given you a liberty to sport with my misfortunes  CON  You know I'd die to serve you Sir but of what use is your giving me leave to spake if you oblige me to hould my tongue 'tis out of pure love and affection that I put you in mind of your misfortunes  LEES  Well Connolly a few days will in all probability enable me to redeem my honour and to reward your fidelity the lovely Emily you know has half consented to embrace the first opportunity of flying with me to Scotland and the paltry trifles I owe will not be miss'd in her Fortune  CON  But dear Sir consider you are going to fight a duel this very evening and if you shou'd be kilt I fancy you will find it a little difficult to run away afterwards with the lovely Emily  LEES  If I fall there will be an end to my misfortunes  CON  But surely it will not be quite genteel to go out of the world without paying your debts  LEES  But how shall I stay in the world Connolly without punishing Belville for ruining my sister  CON  O the devil fly away with this honour an ounce of common sense is worth a whole ship load of it if we must prefer a bullet or a halter to a fine young lady and a great fortune  LEES  We'll talk no more on the subject at present Take this letter to Mr Belville deliver it into his own hand be sure and bring me an answer make haste for I shall not stir out till you come back  CON  By my soul I wish you may be able to stir out then honeyO but that's true  LEES  What's the matter  CON  Why Sir the gentleman I last liv'd clerk  with died lately and left me a legacy of twenty guineas  LEES  What is Mr Stanley dead  CON  Faith his friends have behav'd very unkindly if he is not for they have buried him these six weeks  LEES  And what then  CON  Why Sir I received my little legacy this morning and if you'd be so good as to keep it for me I'd be much oblig'd to you  LEES  Connolly I understand you but I am already shamefully in your debt you've had no money from me this age  CON  O Sir that does not signify if you are not kilt in this damn'd duel you'll be able enough to pay me if you are I shan't want it  LEES  Why so my poor fellow  CON  Because tho' I am but your clerk and tho' I think fighting the most foolish thing upon earth I'm as much a gintleman as yourself and have as much right to commit a murder in the way of duelling  LEES  And what then You have no quarrel with Mr Belville  CON  I shall have a damn'd quarrel with him tho' if you are kilt your death shall be reveng'd depend upon it so let that content you  LEES  My dear Connolly I hope I shan't want such a proof of your affectionHow he distresses me  CON  You will want a second I suppose in this affair I stood second to my own brother in the Fifteen Acres and tho' that has made me detest the very thought of duelling ever since yet if you want a friend I'll attend you to the field of death with a great deal of satisfaction  LEES  I thank you Connolly but I think it extremely wrong in any man who has a quarrel to expose  his friend to difficulties we shou'dn't seek for redress if we are not equal to the task of fighting our own battles and I choose you particularly to carry my letter because you may be supposed ignorant of the contents and thought to be acting only in the ordinary course of your business  CON  Say no more about it honey I will be back with you presently  going returns  I put the twenty guineas in your pocket before you were up Sir and I don't believe you'd look for such a thing there if I wasn't to tell you of it  Exit  LEES  This faithful noblehearted creature but let me fly from thought the business I have to execute will not bear the test of reflection  Exit  Reenter  CONNOLLY  CON  As this is a challenge I shou'dn't go without a sword come down little ticklepitcher  Takes a sword  Some people may think me very conceited now but as the dirtiest black legs in town can wear one without being stared at I don't think it can suffer any disgrace by the side of an honest man  Exit  SCENE  changes to an Apartment at  BELVILLE'S  Enter Mrs  BELVILLE  Mrs  BEL  How strangely this affair of Mrs Tempest hangs upon my spirits tho' I have every reason from the tenderness the politeness and the generosity of Mr Belville as well as from the woman's behaviour to believe the whole charge the result of a disturb'd imaginationYet suppose it should be actually trueheighowell suppose it shou'dI wou'd endeavourI think I wou'd endeavour to keep my tempera frowning face never recovered a heart that was not to be fix'd with a smiling onebut women in general forget this grand article of the matrimonial  creed entirely the dignity of insulted virtue obliges them to play the fool whenever their Corydons play the libertineand poh they must pull down the house about the traitor's ears tho' they are themselves to be crush'd in pieces by the ruins  Enter a Servant  SER  Lady Rachel Mildew madam  Exit Ser  Enter Lady  RACHEL MILDEW  Lady  RACH  My dear how have you done since the little eternity of my last seeing you Mr Torrington is come to town I hear  Mrs  BEL  He is and must be greatly flattered to find that your Ladyship has made him the hero of your new comedy  Lady  RACH  Yes I have drawn him as he is an honest practitioner of the law which is I fancy no very common character  Mrs  BEL  And it must be a vast acquisition to the Theatre  Lady  RACH  Yet the managers of both houses have refused my play have refused it peremptorily tho' I offer'd to make them a present of it  Mrs  BEL  That's very surprizing when you offer'd to make them a present of it  Lady  RACH  They alledge that the audiences are tired of crying at comedies and insist that my Despairing Shepherdess is absolutely too dismal for representation  Mrs  BEL  What tho' you have introduced a lawyer in a new light  Lady  RACH  Yes and have a boardingschool romp that sl  ps her mother's face and throws a bason of scalding water at her governess  Mrs  BEL  Why surely these are capital jokes  Lady  RACH  But the managers can't find them outHowever I am determined to bring it out somewhere and I have discover'd such a treasure for my boardingschool romp as exceeds the most sanguine expectation of criticism  Mrs  BEL  How fortunate  Lady  RACH  Goings to Mrs Le Blond my millener's this morning to see some contraband silks for you know there's a foreign minister just arriv'd I heard a loud voice rehearsing Juliet from the diningroom and upon enquiry found that it was a country girl just elop'd from her friends in town to go upon the stage with an Irish manager  Mrs  BEL  Ten to one the strange woman's neice who has been here this morning  aside  Lady  RACH  Mrs Le Blond has some doubts about the manager it seems though she hasn't seen him yet because the apartments are very expensive and were taken by a fine gentleman out of livery  Mrs  BEL  What am I to think of thisPray Lady Rachel as you have convers'd with this young actress I suppose you could procure me a sight of her  Lady  RACH  This moment if you will I am very intimate with her already but pray keep the matter a secret from your husband for he is so witty you know upon my passion for the drama that I shall be teized to death by him  Mrs  BEL  O you may be very sure that your secret is safe for I have a most particular reason to keep it from Mr Belville but he is coming this way with Captain Savage let us at present avoid him  Exeunt  Enter  BELVILLE  and Captain  SAVAGE  CAPT  You are a very strange man Belville you are for ever tremblingly solicitous about the happiness  of your wife yet for ever endangering it by your passion for variety  BEL  Why there is certainly a contradiction between my principles and my practice but if ever you marry you'll be able to reconcile it perfectly Possession Savage O possession is a miserable whetter of the appetite in love and I own myself so sad a fellow that though I wou'dn't exchange Mrs Belville's mind for any woman's upon earth there is scarcely a woman's person upon earth which is not to me a stronger object of attraction  CAPT  Then perhaps in a little time you'll be weary of Miss Leeson  BEL  To be sure I shall though to own the truth I have not yet carried my point conclusively with the little monkey  CAPT  Why how the plague has she escap'd a moment in your hands  BEL  By a mere accidentShe came to the lodgings which my man Spruce prepar'd for her rather unexpectedly last night so that I happened to be engaged particularly in another quarteryou understand meand the damn'd aunt found me so much employment all the morning that I could only send a message by Spruce promising to call upon her the first moment I had to spare in the course of the day  CAPT  And so your are previously satisfied that you shall be tired of her  BEL  Tir'd of herWhy I am at this moment in pursuit of fresh game against the hour of satietyGame that you know to be exquisite and I fancy I shall bring it down though it is closely guarded by a deal of that pride which passes for virtue with the generallity of your mighty good people  CAPT  Indeed and may a body know this wonder  BEL  You are to be trusted with any thing for you are the closest fellow I ever knew and the rack itself would hardly make you discover one of your own secrets to any bodywhat do you think of Miss Walsingham  CAPT  Miss WalsinghamDeath and the devil  aside  BEL  Miss Walsingham  CAPT  Why surely she has not received your addresses with any degree of approbation  BEL  With every degree of approbation I cou'd expect  CAPT  She has  BEL  Ay Why this news surprises you  CAPT  It does indeed  BEL  Ha ha ha I can't help laughing to think what a happy dog Miss Walsingham's husband is likely to be  CAPT  A very happy dog truly  BEL  She's a delicious girl is'n't she Savage but she'll require a little more troublefor a fine woman like a fortified town to speak in your father's language demands a regular siege and we must even allow her the honours of war to magnify the greatness of our own victory  CAPT  Well it amazes me how you gay fellows ever have the presumption to attack a woman of principle Miss Walsingham has no apparent levity of any kind about her  BEL  No but she continued in my house after I had whispered my passion in her ear and gave me a second opportunity of addressing her improperly what greater encouragement cou'd I desire  Enter  SPRUCE  Well Spruce what are your commands  SPRUCE  My Lady is just gone out with Lady Rachel Sir  BEL  I understand you  SPRUCE  I believe you do    Aside    Exit  CAPT  What is the English of these significant looks between Spruce and you  BEL  Only that Miss Walsingham is left alone and that I have now an opportunity of entertaining her you must excuse me Savage you must upon my soul but not a word of this affair to any body because when I shake her off my hands there may be fools enough to think of her upon terms of honourable matrimony  Exit  CAPT  So here's a discovery a precious discovery and while I have been racking my imagination and sacrificing my interest to promote the happiness of this woman she has been listening to the addresses of another to the addresses of a married man the husband of her friend and the immediate friend of her intended husbandBy Belville's own account however she has not yet proceeded to any criminal lengthsBut why did she keep the affair a secret from me or why did she continue in his house after a repeated declaration of his unwarrantable attachmentWhat's to be doneIf I open my engagement with her to Belville I am sure he will instantly desistbut then her honour is left in a state extremely questionableIt shall be still concealed While it remains unknown Belville will himself tell me every thingand doubt upon an occasion of this nature is infinitely more insupportable than the downright falsehood of the woman whom we love  Exit  The  END  of the  FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  an Apartment in General  SAVAGE's  House  Enter General  SAVAGE  and  TORRINGTON  GEN  ZOUNDS Torrington give me quarter when I surrender up my sword I own that for these twenty years I have been suffering all the inconveniences of marriage without tasting any one of its comforts and rejoicing in an imaginary freedom while I was really grovelling in chains  TOR  In the dirtiest chains upon earthyet you wou'dn't be convinc'd but laugh'd at all your married acquaintance as slaves when not one of them put up with half so much from the worst wife as you were oblig'd to crouch under from a kept mistress  GEN  'Tis too true But you know she sacrificed much for meyou know that she was the widow of a colonel and refus'd two very advantageous matches on my account  TOR  If she was the widow of a judge and had refused a high chancellor she was still a devil incarnate and you were of course a madman to live with her  GEN  You don't remember her care of me when I have been sick  TOR  I recollect however her usage of you in health and you may easily find a tenderer nurse when you are bound over by the gout or the rheumatism  GEN  Well well I agree with you that she is a devil incarnate but I am this day determin'd to part with her for ever  TOR  Not you indeed  GEN  What don't I know my own mind  TOR  Not you indeed when she is in the question with every body else your resolution is as unalterable as a determination in the house of peers but Mrs Tempest is your fate and she reverses your decrees with as little difficulty as a fraudulent debtor nowadays procures his certificate under a commission of bankruptcy  GEN  Well if like the Roman Fabius I conquer by delay in the end there will be no great reason to find fault with my generalship The proposal of parting now comes from herself  TOR  O you darn't make it for the life of you  GEN  You must know that this morning we had a smart cannonnading on Belville's account and she threatens as I told you before to quit my house if I don't challenge him for taking away her neice  TOR  That fellow is the very devil among the women and yet there isn't a man in England fonder of his wife  GEN  Poh if the young minx hadn't surrender'd to him she would have capitulated to somebody else and I shall at this time be doubly obliged to him if he is any ways instrumentall in getting the aunt off my hands  TOR  Why at this time  GEN  Because to shew you how fix'd my resolution is to be a keeper no longer I mean to marry immediately  TOR  And can't you avoid being press'd to death like a felon who refuses to plead without incurring a sentence of perpetual imprisonment  GEN  I fancy you would yourself have no objection  to a perpetual imprisonment in the arms of Miss Walsingham  TOR  But have you any reason to think that upon examination in a case of love she would give a favourable reply to your interrogatories  GEN  The greatestdo you think I'd hazard such an engagement without being perfectly sure of my ground Notwithstanding my present connection won't suffer me to see a modest woman at my own houseShe always treats me with particular attention whenever I visit at Belville's or meet her any where elseIf fifty young fellows are present she directs all her assiduities to the old soldier and my son has a thousand times told me that she professes the highest opinion of my understanding  TOR  And truly you give a notable proof of your understanding in thinking of a woman almost young enough to be your granddaughter  GEN  Nothing like an experienc'd chief to command in any garrison  TOR  Recollect the state of your present citadel  GEN  Well if I am blown up by my own mine I shall be the only suffererThere's another thing I want to talk of I am going to marry my son to Miss Moreland  TOR  Miss Moreland  GEN  Belville's sister  TOR  O ay I remember that Moreland had got a good estate to assume the name of Belville  GEN  I have'nt yet mention'd the matter to my son but I settled the affair with the girl's mother yesterday and she only waits to communicate it to Belville who is her oracle you know  TOR  And are you sure the captain will like her  GEN  I am not so unreasonable as to insist upon his liking her I shall only insist upon his marrying her  TOR  What whether he likes her or not  GEN  When I issue my orders I expect them to be obey'd and don't look for an examination into their propriety  TOR  What a delightful thing it must be to live under a military government where a man is not to be troubled with the exercise of his understanding  GEN  Miss Moreland has thirty thousand pounds That's a large sum of ammunition money  TOR  Ay but a marriage merely on the score of fortune is only gilding the deathwarrant sent down for the execution of a prisoner However as I know your obstinate attachment to what you once resolve I shan't pretend to argue with you where are the papers which you want me to consider  GEN  They are in my libraryFile off with me to the next room and they shall be laid before you But first I'll order the chariot for the moment I have your opinion I purpose to sit down regularly before Miss Walsinghamwho waits there  Enter a servant  GEN  Is Mrs Tempest at home  SERV  Yes Sir just come in and just going out again  GEN  Very well order the chariot to be got ready  SERV  Sir one of the pannels was broke last night at the Operahouse  GEN  Sir I didn't call to have the pleasure of your conversation but to have obedience paid to my orders  TOR  Go order the chariot you blockhead  SERV  With the broken pannel Sir  GEN  Yes you rascal if both pannels were broke and the back shattered to pieces  SERV  The coachman thinks that one of the wheels is damag'd Sir  GEN  Don't attempt to reason you dog but execute  your ordersBring the chariot without the wheelsif you can't bring it with them  TOR  Ay bring it if you reduce it to a sledge and let your master look like a malefactor for high treason on his journey to Tyburn  Enter Mrs  TEMPEST  Mrs  TEMP  General Savage is the house to be for ever a scene of noise with your domineering The chariot shan't be broughtit won't be fit for use 'till it is repairedand John shall drive it this very minute to the coachmakers  GEN  Nay my dear if it isn't fit for use that's another thing  TOR  Here's the experienced chief that's fit to command in any garr  n  aside  GEN  Go order me the coach then  to the Ser  Mrs  TEMP  You can't have the coach  GEN  And why so my love  Mrs  TEMP  Because I want it for myselfRobert get a hack for your mastertho' indeed I don't see what business he has  ut of the house  Exeunt Mrs Tempest and Robert  TOR  When you issu  your orders you expect them to be  b  y'd and don't look for an examination into their propriety  GEN  The furythis has steel'd me against her for ever and nothing on earth can now prevent me from drumming her out immediately  Mrs  TEMP  behind  An unreasonable old fool But I'll make him know who governs this house  GEN  Zounds here she comes again she has been lying in ambuscade I suppose and has over heard us  TOR  What if she has you are steel'd against her for ever  GEN  No she's not comingshe's going down  stairsand now dear Torrington you must be as silent as a sentinel on an outpost about this affair If that virago was to hear a syllable of it she might perhaps attack Miss Walsingham in her very camp and defeat my whole plan of operations  TOR  I thought you were determin'd to drum her out immediately  Exeunt  The  SCENE  changes to  BELVILLE's  Enter Miss  WALSINGHAM  followed by  BELVILLE  Miss  WAL  I beg Sir that you will insult me no longer with solicitations of this natureGive me proofs of your sincerity indeed What proofs of sincerity can your situation admit of if I could be even weak enough to think of you with partiality at all  BEL  If our affections Madam were under the government of our reason circumstanced as I am this unhappy bosom wouldn't be torn by passion for Miss WalsinghamHad I been bless'd with your acquaintance before I saw Mrs Belville my hand as well as my heart wou'd have been humbly offer'd to your acceptancefate however has ordered it otherwise and it is cruel to reproach me with that situation as a crime which ought to be pitied as my greatest misfortune  Miss  WAL  He's actually forcing tears into his eyesHowever I'll mortify him severely    aside    BEL  But such proofs of sincerity as my situation can admit of you shall yourself command as my only business in existence is to adore you  Miss  WAL  His only business in existence to adore me    aside    BEL  Prostrate at your feet my dearest Miss Walsingham  kneeling  behold a heart eternally devoted to your serviceYou have too much good sense Madam to be the slave of custom and too much humanity not to pity the wretchedness you have  causedOnly therefore say that you commiserate my sufferingsI'll ask no moreand surely that may be said without any injury to your purity to snatch even an enemy from distractionwhere's my handkerchief  aside  Miss  WAL  Now to answer in his own way and to make him ridiculous to himself  aside  If I thought if I could think    affecting to weep    that these protestations were real  BEL  How can you Madam be so unjust to your own merit how can you be so cruelly doubtful of my solemn asseverationsHere I again kneel and swear eternal love  Miss  WAL  I don't know what to saybut there is one proof  affecting to weep  BEL  Name it my angel this moment and make me the happiest of mankind  Miss  WAL  Swear to be mine for ever  BEL  I have sworn it a thousand times my charmer and I will swear it to the last moment of my life  Miss  WAL  Why thenbut don't look at me I beseech youI don't know how to speak it  BEL  The delicious emotiondo not check the generous tide of tenderness that fills me with such extasy  Miss  WAL  You'll despise me for this weakness  BEL  This weaknessthis generosity which will demand my everlasting gratitude  Miss  WAL  I am a foolbut there is a kind of fatality in this affairand I do consent to go off with you  BEL  Eternal blessings on your condescension  Miss  WAL  You are irresistible and I am ready to fly with you to any part of the world  BEL  Fly to any part of the world indeedyou shall fly by yourself then    aside    You are the  most lovely the most tender creature in the world and thus again let me thank you O Miss Walsingham I cannot express how happy you've made meBut where's the necessity of our leaving England  Miss  WAL  I thought he wouldn't like to go abroad    aside    That I may possess the pleasure of your company unrival'd  BEL  I must cure her of this taste for travelling    aside    Miss  WAL  You don't answer Mr Belville  BEL  Why I was turning the consequence of your proposal in my thoughts as going offgoing off you know  Miss  WAL  Why going off you know is going off And what objections can you have to going off  BEL  Why going off will subject you at a certainty to the slander of the world whereas by staying at home we may not only have numberless opportunities of meeting but at the same time prevent suspicion it self from ever breathing on your reputation  Miss  WAL  I didn't dream of your starting any difficulties SirJust now I was dearer to you than all the world  BEL  And so you are by heav'n  Miss  WAL  Why won't you sacrifice the world then at once to obtain me  BEL  Surely my dearest life you must know the necessity which every man of honour is under of keeping up his character  Miss  WAL  So here's this fellow swearing to ten thousand lies and yet talking very gravely about his honour and his character  aside  Why to be sure in these days Mr Belville the instances of conjugal infidelity are so very scarce and men of fashion are so remarkable for a tender attachment to their wives that I don't wonder at your circumspectionBut do  you think I can stoop to accept you by halves or admit of any partnership in your heart  BEL  O you must do more than that if you have any thing to say to me  aside  Surely Madam when you know my whole soul unalterably your own you will permit me to preserve those appearances with the world which are indispensibly requisiteMrs Belville is a most excellent woman however it may be my fortune to be devoted to anotherHer happiness besides constitutes a principal part of my felicity and if I was publicly to forsake her I should be hunted as a monster from society  Miss  WAL  Then I suppose it is by way of promoting Mrs Belville's repose Sir that you make love to other women and by way of shewing the nicety of your honour that you attempt the purity of such as your own roof peculiarly intitles to protection For the honour intended to methus low to the ground I thank you Mr Belville  BEL  Laugh'd at by all the stings of mortification▪  Miss  WAL  Good byeDon't let this accident mortify your vanity too muchbut take care the next time you vow everlasting love that the object is neither tender enough to sobsobat your distress nor provoking enough to make a proposal of leaving EnglandHow greatly a little common sense can lower these fellows of extraordinary impudence  Exit  BEL  alone  So then I am fairly taken in and she has been only diverting herself with me all this time however lady fair I may chance to have the laugh in a little time on my side for if you can sport in this manner about the flame I think it must in the run lay hold of your wingswhat shall I do in this affairshe sees the matter in its true light and there's no good to be expected from thumping of bosoms or squeezing white handkerchiefsno these  won't do with women of sense and in a short time they'll be ridiculous to the very babies of a boardingschool  Enter Captain  SAVAGE  CAPT  Well Belville what news You have had a fresh opportunity with Miss Walsingham  BEL  Why faith Savage I've had a most extraordinary scene with her and yet have but little reason to brag of my good fortune tho' she offer'd in express terms to run away with me  CAPT  Prith'ee explain yourself man she cou'dn't surely be so shameless  BEL  O her offering to run away with me was by no means the worst part of the affair  CAPT  No then it must be damn'd bad indeed but prith'ee hurry to an explanation  BEL  Why then the worst part of the affair is that she was laughing at me the whole time and made this proposal of an elopement with no other view than to shew me in strong colours to myself as a very dirty fellow to the best wife in England  CAPT  I am easy  aside  Enter  SPRUCE  SPRUCE  Sir there is an Irish gentleman below with a letter for you who will deliver it to nobody but yourself  BEL  Shew him up then  SPRUCE  Yes Sir  Exit  CAPT  It may be on business Belville I'll take my leave of you  BEL  O by no means I can have no business which I desire to keep from you tho' you are the arrant'st miser of your confidence upon earth and wou'd rather trust your

your service Sir  CON  I have a little bit of a letter for you Sir  BEL    Reads    SIR  The people where Miss Leeson lately lodg'd asserting positively that you have taken her away in a fictitious character the brother of that unhappy girl thinks himself oblig'd to demand satisfaction for the injury which you have done his family tho' a stranger to your person he is sufficiently acquainted with your reputation for spirit and shall therefore make no doubt of seeing you with a case of pistols near the Ring in Hyde Park at eight o'clock this evening to answer the claims of  George Leeson  To Craggs Belville Esq  CAPT  Eight o'clock in the evening 'tis a strange time  CON  Why so honey A fine evening is as good a time for a bad action as a fine morning and if a man of sense can be such a fool as to fight a duel he shou'd never sleep upon the matter for the more he thinks of it the more he must feel himself asham'd of his resolution  BEL  A pretty letter  CON  O yes an invitation to a brace of bullets is a very pretty thing  BEL  For a challenge however 'tis very civilly written  CON  Faith if it was written to me I shou'dn't be very fond of such civility I wonder he doesn't sign himself your most obedient servant  CAPT  I told you Leeson's character and what wou'd become of this damn'd business but your affairsare they settled Belville  BEL  O they are always settledfor as this is a country where people occasionally die I take constant care to be prepared for contingencies  CON  Occasionally dieI'll be very much oblig'd to you Sir if you tell me the country where people do not die for I'll immediately go and end my days there  BEL  Ha ha ha  CON  Faith you may laugh gintlemin but tho' I am a foolish Irishman and come about a foolish piece of business I'd prefer a snug birth in this world bad as it is to the finest coffin in all Christendom  BEL  I am surpris'd Sir that thinking in this manner you would be the bearer of a challenge  CON  And well you may SirBut we must often take a pleasure in serving our friends by doing things that are very disagreeable to us  CAPT  Then you think Mr Leeson much to blame perhaps for hazarding his life where he can by no means repair the honour of his sister  CON  Indeed and I doBut I shall think this gintleman begging his pardon much more to blame for meeting him  BEL  And why so SirYou woudn't have me disappoint your friend  CON  Faith and that I wou'dHe poor lad may have some reason at present to be tir'd of the world but you have a fine estate a fine wife a fine parcel of childrenIn short honey you have every thing to make you fond of living and the devil burn me was I in your case if I'd stake my own happiness against the misery of any man  BEL  I am very much oblig'd to your advice Sir tho' on the present occasion I cannot adopt it be so  good as to present my compliments to your friend and tell him I shall certainly do myself the honour of attending his appointment  CON  Why then upon my soul I am very sorry for it  CAPT  'Tis not very customary Sir with gentlemen of Ireland to oppose an affair of honour  CON  They are like the gintlemin of England Sir they are brave to a fault yet I hope to see the day that it will be infamous to draw the swords of either against any body but the enemies of their country  Exit  BEL  I am quite charmed with this honest Hibernian and would almost fight a duel for the pleasure of his acquaintance  CAPT  Come step with me a little and let us consider whether there may not be some method of accommodating this cursed business  BEL  Poh don't be uneasy upon my account my character with regard to affairs of this nature is unhappily too well established and you may be sure that I shan't fight with Leeson  CAPT  Noyou have injured him greatly  BEL  The very reason of all others why I should not cut his throat  Exeunt  Enter  SPRUCE  SPRUCE  What the devil this master of mine has got a a duel upon his hands Zounds I am sorry for that he is a prince

Walsingham an affair of importance to me and to yourself Have you leisure to favour me with a short audience if I beat a parley  Miss  WAL  Any thing of importance to you Sir is always sufficient to command my leisure'Tis as the Captain suspected  aside  GEN  You tremble my lovely girl but don't be alarmed for though my business is of an important nature I hope it won't be of a disagreeable one

prize at all worth your acceptance  Miss  WAL  Upon my word Sir there's no masked battery in this question  GEN  I am as fond of a coup de main Madam in love as in war and hate the tedious method of sapping a town when there is a possibility of entering sword in hand  Miss  WAL  Why really Sir a woman may as well know her own mind when she is first summoned by the trumpet of a lover as when she undergoes all the tiresome formality of a siege You see I have caught your own mode of conversing General  GEN  And a very great compliment I consider it Madam But now that you have candidly confess'd an acquaintance with your own mind answer me with that frankness for which every body admires you so much Have you any objection to change the name of Walsingham  Miss  WAL  Why then frankly General Savage I say no  GEN  Ten thousand thanks to you for this kind declaration  Miss  WAL  I hope you won't think it a forward one  GEN  I'd sooner see my son run away in the day of battleI'd sooner think Lord Russell was bribed by Lewis the XIVth and sooner villify the memory of Algernoon Sidney  Miss  WAL  How unjust it was ever to suppose the General a tyrannical father  aside  GEN  You have told me condescendingly Miss Walsingham that you have no objection to change your name I have but one question more to ask  Miss  WAL  Pray propose it  GEN  Would the name of Savage be disagreeable to youSpeak frankly again my dear girl  Miss  WAL  Why then again I frankly say no  GEN  You make me too happy and though I shall readily own that a proposal of this nature would come with more propriety from my son  Miss  WAL  I am much better pleas'd that you make the proposal yourself Sir  GEN  You are too good to meTorrington thought that I should meet with a repulse  aside  Miss  WAL  Have you communicated this business to the Captain Sir  GEN  No my dear Madam I did not think that at all necessary I have always been attentive to the Captain's happiness and I propose that he shall be married in a few days  Miss  WAL  What whether I will or no  GEN  O you can have no objection  Miss  WAL  I must be consulted however about the day General but nothing in my power shall be wanting to make him happy  GEN  Obliging loveliness  Miss  WAL  You may imagine that if I was not previously imprest in favour of your proposal it wou'd not have met my concurrence so readily  GEN  Then you own that I had a previous friend in the garrison  Miss  WAL  I don't blush to acknowledge it when I consider the accomplishments of the object Sir  GEN  O this is too much Madam the principle merit of the object is his passion for Miss Walsingham  Miss  WAL  Don't say that General I beg of you for I don't think there are many women in the kingdom who could behold him with indifference  GEN  Ah you flattering flattering angeland yet by the memory of Marlborough my lovely girl it was the idea of a prepossession on your part which encouraged me to hope for a favourable reception  Miss  WAL  Then I must have been very indiscreet for I labour'd to conceal that prepossession as much as possible  GEN  You cou'dn't conceal it from me you cou'dn't conceal it from meThe female heart is a field which I am thoroughly acquainted with and which has more than once been a witness to my victories Madam  Miss  WAL  I don't at all doubt your success with the ladies General but as we now understand one

What because I am unwilling to be miserable  Lady  RACH  This new instance of Mr Belville's infidelityThis attempt to seduce Miss Walsingham which your woman overheard is unpardonable  Mrs  BEL  I don't say but that I am strongly wounded by his irregularities Yet if Mr Belville is unhappily a rover I wou'd much rather that he should have twenty mistresses than one  Lady  RACH  You astonish me  Mrs  BEL  Why don't you know my dear madam that while he is divided amidst a variety of objects 'tis impossible for him to have a serious attachment  Lady  RACH  Lord Mrs Belville how can you speak

custom is render'd infamousWives must shriek mothers must agonizeorphans must multiply unless some blessed hand strips the fascinating glare from honourable murder and bravely exposes the idol who is worship'd thus in blood While it is disreputable to obey the laws we cannot look for reformationBut if the duellist is once banished from the presence of his sovereignif he is for life excluded the confidence of his countryif a mark of indelible disgrace is stamp'd upon him the sword of publick justice will be the sole chastiser of wrongs trifles will not be punish'd with death and offences really meriting such a punishment will be reserv'd for the only proper avenger the common executioner  Lady  RACH  I cou'dn't have express'd myself better on the subject my dear but till such a hand

an attorney general  GEN  Surely you can't forget that at the first word you hung out a flag of truce told me even  that I had a previous friend in the fort and didn't so much as hint at a single article of capitulation  TOR  Now for the rejoinder to this replication  Miss  WAL  All this is unquestionably true General and perhaps a good deal more but in reality my confusion before you on this

about the scandalous appointment with him I was speaking when you conceiv'd I treated her so rudely  GEN  And you were only anxious to shew her in her real character to me when I was so exceedingly offended with you  CAPT  Nothing else in the world Sir I knew you would despise and detest her the moment you were acquainted with her baseness  GEN  How she brazen'd it out before my face and what a regard she affected for your interest I was a madman not to listen then to your explanation  TOR  Tho' you both talk this point well I still see nothing but strong presumption against Miss Walsingham Mistakes have already happened mistakes may happen again and I will not give up a lady's honour upon an evidence that wou'd not cast a common pickpocket at the Old Baily  CAPT  Come to the masquerade then and be convinc'd  GEN  Let us detach a party for dresses immediately Yet remember Torrington that the punctuality of evidence which is necessary in a court of law is by no means requisite in a

new violence  BEL  I am come Mr Leeson upon an affair Sir  CON  The devil burn me if he was half so much confounded a while ago when there was a naked sword at his breast  BEL  I am come Mr Leeson

it is Sir  BEL  And the lady's name is Moreland isn't it Sir  LEES  I can't see what business you have with her name Sir You took away my sister and I hope you have no designs upon the lady in the

pretensions have you to the lady in the next room even supposing her to be Miss Moreland  BEL  No other pretensions than what a brother should have to the defence of his sister's honour You thought yourself authorised to cut my throat awhile ago in a similar business  LEES  And is Miss Moreland your sister  BEL  Sir there is insolence in that question you know she is  LEES  By heaven I did not know it till this moment but I rejoice at the discovery This is blow for blow  CON  Devil burn me but they have fairly made a swop of it  BEL  And you really didn't know that Miss Moreland was my sister  LEES  I don't conceive myself under much necessity of apologizing to you Sir but I am incapable of a dishonourable design upon any woman and tho' Miss Moreland in our short acquaintance repeatedly  mentioned her brother she never once told me that his name was Belville  CON  And he has had such few opportunities of being in her company unless by letters honey that he knew nothing

you seem as necessary for the girl's happiness as she seems for your's you shall marry her here in town with the consent of all her friends and save yourself the trouble of an expedition to Scotland  LEES  Can I believe you serious  BEL  Zounds Leeson that air of surprise is a sad reproach I didn't surprise you when I did a bad action but I raise your astonishment when I do a good one  CON  And by my soul Mr Belville if you knew how a good action becomes a man you'd never do a bad one as long as you liv'd  LEES  You have given me life and happiness in one day Mr Belville however it is now time you should see your sister I know you'll be gentle with her tho' you have so much reason to condemn her choice and generously remember that her elopement proceeded from the great improbability there was of a beggar's ever meeting with the approbation of her family  BEL  Don't apologize for your circumstances Leeson a princess could do no more than make you happy and if you make her so you meet her upon terms of the most perfect equality  LEES  This is a new way of thinking Mr Belville  BEL  'Tis only an honest way of thinking and I consider my sister a gainer upon the occasion for a man of your merit is more difficult to be found than a woman of her fortune  Exeunt Leeson and Belville  CON  What's the reason now that I can't skip and laugh and rejoice at this affair Upon my soul my heart's as full as if I had met with some great misfortune Well pleasure in the extreme is certainly a very painful thing I am really asham'd of these womans drops and yet I don't know but that I

WELL happiness is once more mine and the women are all going in tiptop spirits to the masquerade Now Mr Belville let me have a few words with you Miss Walsingham the ripe the luxurious Miss Walsingham expects to find you there burning with impatienceBut my dear friend after the occurrences of the day can you be weak enough to plunge into fresh crimes Can you be base  enough to abuse the goodness of that angel your wife and wicked enough not only to destroy the innocence which is shelter'd beneath your own roof but to expose your family perhaps again to the danger of losing a son a brother a father and a husband The possession of the three Graces is surely too poor a recompence for the folly you must commit for the shame you must feel and the consequences you must hazard Upon my soul if I struggle a little longer I shall rise in my own opinion and be less a rascal than I think myselfAy but the object is bewitchingthe matter will be an eternal secretand if it is known that I sneak in this pitiful manner from a fine woman when the whole elysium of her person solicits mewell and am I afraid the world should know that I have shrunk from an infamous actionA thousand blessings on you dear conscience for that one argumentI shall be an honest man after allSuppose however that I give her the meeting that's dangerousthat's dangerousand I am so little accustomed to do what is right that I shall certainly do what is wrong the moment I am in the way of temptation Come Belville your resolution is not so very slender a dependance and you owe Miss Walsingham reparation for the injury which you have done her principles I'll give her the meetingI'll take her to the house I intendedI'llZounds what a fool I have been all this time to look for precarious satisfaction in vice when there is such exquisite pleasure to be found at a certainty in virtue  Exit  Enter Lady  Rachel  and Mrs  Belville  Lady  RACH  For mirth sake don't let him see us There has been a warm debate between his

BEL  Not in the least I am sure my heart has no occasion  Lady  RACH  Have you let Miss Walsingham into our little plot  Mrs  BEL  You know she cou'd not be insensible of Mr Belville's design upon herself and it is no farther than that design we have any thing to carry into execution  Lady  RACH  Well she may serve to facilitate the matter and therefore I am not sorry that you have trusted her  Mrs  BEL  We shall be too late and then what signifies all your fine plotting  Lady  RACH  Is it not a little pang of jealousy that wou'd fain now quicken our motions  Mrs  BEL  No Lady Rachel it is a certainty of my husband's love and generosity that makes me wish to come to the trial I wou'd not exchange my confidence in his affections for all the mines of Peru so nothing you can say will make me

four thousand people there was a major of horse who put in for it and pleaded a large family  SPRUCE  With long services I suppose  GHAST  Yes but Mrs Tempest insisted upon my long services so the major was set asideHowever to keep the thing from the damn'd Newspapers I fancy he will succeed the barber who died last night poor woman of a lyingin fever after being brought to bed of three childrenPlaces in public institutions  SPRUCE  Are often sweetly dispos'd I think of asking Belville for something one of these days  GHAST  He has great interest  SPRUCE  I might be a justice of peace if I pleased and in a shabby neighbourhood where the mere swearing would bring in something tolerable but there are so many strange people let into the commission nowadays that I shou'dn't like

an error which proceeded only from an extravagance of love  Miss  WAL  To think me capable of such an action Captain Savage I am terrified at the idea of a union with you and it is better for a woman
