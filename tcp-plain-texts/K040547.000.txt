 ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ KNOW YOUR SELF A POEM  LONDON  Printed for J TONSON in the  Strand  MDCCXXXIV Price Six Pence  ADVERTISEMENT  The following Poem was wrote several Years ago As it may do good to some and cannot hurt the Reputation of the Author though he should be known I have given it to my Bookseller to publish It contains some Thoughts of Monsieur  Pascal  which cannot make it less acceptable to the Publick  ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ KNOW YOUR SELF  _WHAT am I how produc'd and for what End  Whence drew I Being to what Period tend  Am I th' abandon'd Orphan of blind Chance  Dropt by wild Atoms in disorder'd Dance  Or from an endless Chain of Causes wrought  And of unthinking Substance born with Thought  By Motion which began without a Cause  Supremely wise without Design or Laws  Am I but what I seem mere Flesh and Blood  A branching Channel with a mazy Flood  The purple Stream that through my Vessels glides  Dull and unconscious flows like common Tides  The Pipes thro' which the circling Juices stray  Are not that thinking I no more than They  This Frame compacted with transcendent Skill  Of moving Joints obedient to my Will  Nurs'd from the fruitful Glebe like yonder Tree  Waxes and wastes I call it Mine not Me  New Matter still the mould'ring Mass sustains  The Mansion chang'd the Tenant still remains  And from the fleeting Stream repair'd by Food  Distinct as is the Swimmer from the Flood  What am I then Sure of a nobler Birth  Thy Parents Right I own a Mother  Earth    But claim superior Lineage by my SIRE  Who warm'd th' unthinking Clod with heav'nly Fire  Essence divine with lifeless Clay allay'd  By double Nature double Instinct sway'd  With Look erect I dart my longing Eye  Seem wing'd to part and gain my native Sky  I strive to mount but strive alas in vain  Ty'd to this massy Globe with magick Chain  Now with swift Thought I range from Pole to Pole  View Worlds around their flaming Centers roll  What steddy Powers their endless Motions guide  Thro' the same tractless Paths of boundless Void  I trace the blazing Comet's fiery Trail  And weigh the whirling Planets in a Scale  These Godlike Thoughts while eager I pursue  Some glitt'ring Trifle offer'd to my view  A Gnat an Insect of the meanest kind  Erase the newborn Image from my Mind  Some beastly Want craving importunate  Vile as the grinning Mastiffs at my Gate  Calls off from heav'nly Truth this reas'ning Me  And tells me I'm a Brute as much as He  If on sublimer Wings of Love and Praise  My Soul above the starry Vault I raise  Lur'd by some vain Conceit or shameful Lust  I flag I drop and flutter in the Dust  The tow'ring Lark thus from her lofty Strain  Stoops to an Emmet or a Barley Grain  By adverse Gusts of jarring Instincts tost  I rove to one now to the other Coast  To Bliss unknown my lofty Soul aspires  My Lot unequal to my vast Desires  As 'mongst the Hinds a Child of Royal Birth  Finds his high Pedigree by conscious Worth  So Man amongst his FellowBrutes expos'd  Sees he's a King but 'tis a King depos'd  Pity him Beasts you by no Law confin'd  Are barr'd from devious Paths by being blind  Whilst Man through op'ning Views of various Ways  Confounded by the Aid of Knowledge strays  Too weak to choose yet choosing still in haste  One Moment gives the Pleasure and Distaste  Bilk'd by past Minutes while the present cloy  The flatt'ring future still must give the Joy  Not happy but amus'd upon the Road  And like you thoughtless of his last Abode  Whether next Sun his Being shall restrain  To endless Nothing Happiness or Pain  Around me lo the thinking thoughtless Crew  Bewilder'd each their diff'rent Paths pursue  Of them I ask the Way the first replies  Thou art a God and sends me to the Skies  Down on this Turf the next thou twolegg'd Beast  There fix thy Lot thy Bliss and endless Rest  Between those wide Extremes the length is such  I find I know too little or too much  " Almighty Pow'r by whose most wise Command  " Helpless forlorn uncertain here I stand  " Take this faint Glimmering of thy self away  " Or break into my Soul with perfect Day"  This said expanded lay the sacred Text  The Balm the Light the Guide of Souls perplext  Thus the benighted Traveller that strays  Through doubtful Paths enjoys the Morning Rays  The nightly Mist and thick descending Dew  Parting unfold the Fields and vaulted Blue  " O Truth divine enlightned by thy Ray  " I grope and guess no more but see my way  " Thou cleardst the Secret of my high Descent  And told me what those mystick Tokens meant  Marks of my Birth which I had worn in vain  Too hard for worldly Sages to explain  Zeno  's were vain vain  Epicurus  ' Schemes  Their Systems false delusive were their Dreams  Unskill'd my twofold Nature to divide  One nurs'd my Pleasure and one nurs'd my Pride  Those jarring Truths which Human Art beguile  Thy sacred Page thus bid me reconcile  Offspring of God no less thy Pedigree  What thou once wer't art now and still may be  Thy God alone can tell alone decree  Faultless thou dropt from his unerring Skill  With the bare Pow'r to sin since free of Will  Yet charge not with thy Guilt his bounteous Love  For who has Power to walk has Power to rove  Who acts by force impell'd can nought deserve  And Wisdom short of infinite may swerve  Born on thy newimp'd Wings thou took'st thy Flight  Left thy Creator and the Realms of Light  Disdain'd his gentle Precept to fulfil  And thought to grow a God by doing ill  Though by foul Guilt thy heav'nly Form defac'd  In Nature chang'd from happy Mansions chac'd  Thou still retain'st some Sparks of heav'nly Fire  Too faint to mount yet restless to aspire  Angel enough to seek thy Bliss again  And Brute enough to make the Search in vain  The Creatures now withdraw their kindly Use  Some fly thee some torment and some seduce  Repast ill suited to such diff'rent Guests  For what thy Sense desires thy Soul distastes  Thy Lust thy Curiosity thy Pride  Curb'd or deferr'd or balk'd or gratify'd  Rage on and make thee equally unbless'd  In what thou want'st and what thou hast possest  In vain thou hop'st for Bliss on this poor Clod  Return and seek thy Father and thy God  Yet think not to regain thy native Sky  Born on the Wings of vain Philosophy  Mysterious Passage hid from human Eyes  Soaring you'll sink and sinking you will rise  Let humble Thoughts thy wary Footsteps guide  Regain by Meekness what you lost by Pride  FINIS
