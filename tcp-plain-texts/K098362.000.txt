 A BRIEF CONCORDANCE TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT  By which ALL or MOST of the Principal Texts of Scripture may be easily found out  BY JOHN BROWN Minister Of the Gospel at Haddington  Search the scriptures forthey testify of me  John  The Bereans were more noblein that theysearched the scriptures daily  Acts  EDINBURGH Printed by and for GAVIN ALSTON Sold by J MATTHEWS Strand London MDCCLXXXIII  Entered in STATIONER'S HALL  To the READER  THAT this Concordance doth not pretend to comprehend more than any other larger ones but to contain the principal substance of the small in little room By observing what is One or More principal words of any remembered text and what are the three first letters of them and searching under answerable words in the Concordance the sentence will be found The original words whether Nouns or Verbs are marked in CAPITAL or double letters and these derived from them come after in  Italics  Where words are found in many places the plural is distinguished from the singular and the parts of verbs ending in  ed    est    eth  from their original But when the examples are few no such distinction is made but may be easily observed The Concordant words except the first are marked by the first letter a b c  c  and the names of the mark stands for several words above marked in  Italics  divine Persons by answerable capitals Even other words especially names of divine Persons are often marked by one or more of their first letters that the sense of the line might be more complete Notwithstanding considerable care both in writing and printing sometimes one figure of a number is omitted as in for or one like figure is put for another as for c But by remembering this the place of the text may be easily found  A
