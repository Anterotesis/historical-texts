 A DEFENCE OF THE PAMPHLET ASCRIBED TO  JOHN REEVES Esq  AND ENTITLED  "Thoughts on the English Government"  Price Two Shillings and Sixpence  A DEFENCE OF THE PAMPHLET ASCRIBED TO  JOHN REEVES ESQ  AND ENTITLED  "Thoughts on the English Government"  BY THE REV J BRAND A M  ADDRESSED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE  LOYAL ASSOCIATIONS  AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND LEVELLERS  LONDON PRINTED FOR T N LONGMAN PATERNOSTERROW AND J OWEN PICCADILLY AND SOLD BY ALL THE BOOKSELLERS AT THE ROYAL EXCHANGE    INTRODUCTION ADDRESSED TO THE  ASSOCIATIONS  AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND LEVELLERS  MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN  MR REEVES the Institutor of the Associations has been charged as appears by the printed Debates in the Newspapers by some Speakers in the two Houses with having written a supposed libel on the Constitution a similar crimination has also been brought forward against Mr Arthur Young who first stated and impressed upon the Nation the necessity of property being armed to defend itself and thus laid the foundation of the institution of the Yeomanry Cavalry to be employed against external violence and internal insurrection The same Gentle∣man has taken the leading part in both these accusa∣tions  EACH of the above Institutions is hereby exposed to one common danger The great majority of mankind judge  of measures by their authors If their general principles be believed to be inimical to the freedom of our mixed Government the same bad quality will be supposed to lurk in every one of their measures especially such as shall not have been frequently seen carried into exe∣cution and as this class of people judges by names not things it is evident to what hazards the success of any measure requiring the cooperation of multitudes may be exposed if an erroneous charge be suffered to be at∣tached to the name of its author  HENCE it appears that the charge against these Gen∣tlemen is  admirably calculated  to excite a jealousy against the plans they have proposed for the of the public I now advert particularly to its probable effect on the Associations founded by Mr Reeves for it is to the at∣tack upon him that the whole of the following Tract will apply It was expedient however to mention that on Mr Young as it is a part of the same measure and which for that reason will be introduced a second time to your consideration at its proper place  THESE jealousies are easily improved into clamours and these again heightened into the alarming appearance of popular discontent This will weaken your Associa∣tions it will draw off a great number of the Associators of the middle classes but terrify many morethe muscles that make the nerves of the arm effective For if Discon∣tent be unable so totally to paralize your Institution Fear is at hand to assist it We have among us those who are not ignorant of the receipt to inflame discontent to its highest pitch They want not the hardiness in the face of day to conduct it on precisely to that very  point which immediately precedes the extreme of vio∣lence and outrage If new Meetings of the Associations become necessary numbers will be thus kept away Those who shall venture to come to the support of the effective Constitution will be terrified to see three quarters of their force annihilated they will hear the commands of their insolent and new masters and be glad to compound for safety by nonefficiency  LOOK back to the state of the kingdom when your Associations first were formed What man qualified to think on the interest of the State except those interested in the subversion of it who did not in his face carry all the marks of consternation But when men who wished well to their country of all descriptions of parties be∣came united in their union in the  bonorum omnium con∣sensus  they saw their superiority the faction seemed to fall before you  IT is much to be wished on your parts that the same popular favour the same opinion of the Constitutional principles on which your Associations were formed and of the objects they have pursued might still second you if they should be again called forth as the events of every day may add new importance to them Their continuation and their undiminished vigour may be necessary for the preservation of legal Government But if the principles of the man who formed the bond of union by which you are cemented be injuriously reputed to be adverse to the principles of the existing limited Monarchy that union will become the object of popular jealousy as I have shown before it will be weakened and in danger of being rendered nugatory  If therefore good reason support him you will equitably hear that reason Truth knows no predilection When you fit in judgment you must discard all precon∣ceived sentiments of favour I should not indeed press you to forget it any longer than until your ultimate sen∣tence be given Were I to fit in judgment on such an oc∣casion I should bend all my faculties to fulfil the severe and necessary functions of a Judge the rational organ of the Law that knows no affections But if the innocence of the defendant should extort an acquittal from me I should then think my awful function at an end I should rise from my tribunal to congratulate the brother or the benefactor who had stood as a culprit before me When I had finished my duty as a Judge those of my prior relation would claim the next place I shall only say fur∣ther that in the defence of the passage quoted by Mr She∣ridan from the pamphlet I impose this law upon myself The principles it contains shall be proved to be the first principles of English Law and on the best esteemed au∣thorities on  primâ facie  evidence Where I apprehend a doubt may be attached to the utility of such principles even though laid down in the law books they shall be supported by the authority of political writers proved by abstract reasoning and the process of a regular induction from historical examples The matter purely historical shall also be proved from the best English histories or historical disquisitions on the subject and on  primâ facie  evidence likewise as in proofs of the first description If these arguments shall impress you with conviction what your wellweighed judgment shall approve you will support In the hour of exertion or difficulty much of your effective strength will depend upon it  BUT to prevent misconstruction something must be added by way of explanation here before I proceed to another very important consideration which must find a place in my Address to you It is not meant that the principle of civil Associations and those to be considered in the extract from the Pamphlet are so connected as ne∣cessarily to stand and fall together The effect of the latter on the former is purely accidental as being supposed to be brought forward by the same man yet in the pre∣sent circumstances of the times it must be neverthe∣less real although the principles of the Associations are defensible on their own proper grounds and as an attack is recommenced against them I state one of those grounds among others which at the moment suggests itself to me When a body of insurgents are actually assembled and have just begun by open force to attack Government they are to be repulsed by assem∣blies of loyal subjects and by the like force If those of the former description unite into bodies actually or appa∣rently for the ends stated above those of the latter should by a parity of reason unite or associate to oppose and resist them and by every other means prevent their gathering in such force or putting themselves in such situations as might facilitate the attack No good Government can reject what is a funda∣mental principle of perfect Government as this may be shown to be for supposing a form of Govern∣ment of plenary and absolute perfection should begin to exist it must include this principle or it would want one good property which it possibly might possess the greatest chance of permanency which is contrary to the supposed nature of such a form It may be said that a Government so constituted would resemble a perfect  machine and be able to preserve itself in motion without the assistance of any additional help but a Government of that description must be numbered among the bad forms for it debases the human character by banishing from every breast all care about that greatest interest  a Public  Every interest that could be advanced or ob∣structed would be private Hence every end pursued would be little for the range of the mind of a Nation is near∣ly circumscribed by the limits of the object it has to pursue and its energies employed only on little things never obtain their natural growth The empire of China is an imperfect example of such a State This argument or others far better might be urged in vain in favour of the principles of the Association if it could be alledged against them that they spring from a polluted source  I HAVE shown how far the utility of these Associations is endangered by the accusations which have been thus urged against them I shall now consider the ends to which these accusations are intended apparently to be subservient  AT the instant they were brought forward the ferment in the spirits of the people was at a height which has been yet unequalled The populace had been wrought up to attack the King's person laws were introduced into the House to cut up the very root of those machi∣nations by which this atrocious spirit had been kindled the execution of which laws may ultimately rely much on the support of the Associations The zeal the alacrity and the strength of the Cavalry may likewise tend much to keep back the first appearance of violence and this Institution might be extended into more counties  as the approaching necessity increased The accusation of Mr Reeves and Mr Young have a direct tendency to prevent such increase to weaken the attachment of the one to the cause in which they are engaged to paralise the exertions of the other and to leave the country open to the treasons which are meditating  WHEN I consider the passage which is the object of the legal inquiry to be made in conjunction with what precedes and follows it  This is requisite in every fair statement of a Writer's meaning or principles without it he may be represented as speaking what is different or contradictory to them  the original complaint seems to have been intended as a false attack only Nothing was probably expected from it where it was brought forward But though the Party imagined it would be inefficacious there they had considerable expectation of the effect the bare name of such a thing might have in another quarter By a Motion against the principles said to have been ad∣vanced by Mr Reeves and one or two intemperate de∣clamations made in support of it they had hoped to ren∣der the Associations intirely inefficient at a time when certain speeches upon another topic tended to create so urgent a necessity for their most spirited exertions in fa∣vour of legal Government  CONTRARY to expectation the friends of Govern∣ment gave way and some admitted the book at∣tributed to Mr Reeves to be a libel on the Constitution If we search for the cause of this singular event it will not be very difficult to discover it It is but at this instant as it were that men begin to examine the Consti∣tution  and its principles in the only true source of in∣formation the letter of the Law We have all been edu∣cated to look for it in brilliant romances of Legislation entirely different therefrom When practical necessity calls upon us to consider this political Cartesianism one error of it drops today another tomorrow but the multitude that remain still seem almost as well rooted as ever when they are discussed only as points of specula∣tion The Writer of the Tract presented three or four points relating to the legal Constitution as the existing laws state them and that without demonstration These being somewhat different from what is to be found in the fine writings I have just mentioned which are judged by many as infallible standards of truth were hastily con∣demned It might become the dignity of the Commons in future to make it a rule of the House that in case of any writing being there complained of a Committee should be appointed to select such passages from it as they thought required examination and these should be sent to the printer or author if avowed and the book should lie ten days upon the table before any further proceedings should be had upon it  WHEN it was now perceived that some impression was made a person of more established weight in the Party stepped forward and converted this false attack into a real one the extent and object of which I shall describe Mr R  eves had in succeeded in instituting two thou∣sand Associations against Republicans and Levellers Against these likewise and our foreign enemies Mr Young bad succeeded in causing a fine body of  orse to be raised and stationed over the country and these were for    me  i  tiu  ver    of what Cromwell  thought the best materials This was to effect great things and it is as much the interest of a combination to ruin the men who have done such things as men who bear great titles and our factions at present know their own interest I find too in this transaction an exact resem∣blance of the conduct of the leaders of the Long Parlia∣ment not indeed in that part of their conduct which de∣serves our praises but in their extreme violenceThose who they supposed could effect much for the King were impeached some of them had titles indeed and their judges were forced by mobs to condemn them  THIS new assailant is reported in the public prints to have stated this Pamphlet to be a part of a series of at∣tempts to make the Crown everything and the People nothing He joins in this censure the writings of  Soame Jenyns Dr Whitaker  and  Mr Young  and by a sweep∣ing clause he includes an indefinite number of those Gentlemen who in concert with Mr Reeves's Com∣mittee have endeavoured to preserve the peace and legal Constitution of the kingdom From the encouragement which the spirit of resistance to laws now established has lately received from the violent declarations of the Mino∣rity the union of the best abilities of such men is likely to become more necessary than ever and at this very junc∣ture to deter them from employing their best faculties in the cause of their country the terror of a Parliamen∣tary prosecution is hung over their heads Nor are the Associations less directly denounced "whose system" the same Gentleman is declared in these Papers to have asserted to be  to draw the Lords and Commons into contempt and to place the King to govern  alone  adding also that if the powers of the Committee  had been enlarged  What precedent was selected to favour such enlargement That of a Committee of the Commons in And what was one of the offences of  Janes  and  Weston  They had said that  Calvin  was a favourer of Democracy I cite the Universal History'Did he not ultimately maintain the liberty of the Republic of Geneva  V p  as such when it was in danger of falling as soon as it roseThis particular inquiry was instituted to keep up the ferment of the Nation about the Popish Plota disgrace to our historyand by a House of Commons "who greatly lamented the death of  Bedloe  "as a material witness on whose testimony they much depended" who endeavoured by their countenance and protection to purge off the extreme infamy of  Dangerfield  pilloried four times and an outlaw  P  and to restore him to a capacity of being a witness  P  embracing the most incredible texture of falsehood and wickedness and supporting the belief of it by a series of legal murders to in∣troduce the Exclusion Bill whatever the consequences of that mea∣sure might have been The popular violences and anarchy of the insurrection at Munster had at first flung a load of odium on the Protestants in general and Luther had found it necessary to refute the charges brought against himself and his disciples But it is needless to make any observations on the worse part of the con∣duct of the Parliament of pieced with some links of the chain of measures taken up by that of  If the matter which is here stated from the public papers was really brought forward in the House I feel some astonishment at the impolicy of its introduction Men had presently after some late State Trials reflected pretty much upon those which took place before London Juries at the time of the Popish Plot the period of our history the Newspapers state to have been referred to Can it  be doubted but Faction led on some and fear for their own safety amidst enemies they could not at all times guard against induced others to find those guilty whose innocence was sufficiently esta∣blished by evidence And is it not to be supposed that a guilty person with proofs as strong against him would even with more facility have been declared innocent if the Juries had been influenced that way by the same motives And we find charges of this kind when the offenders were of the popular party strongly urged against the Juries of the metropolis in the last century See Hume v p Dalrymple's Mem p The mention of the Committee of points out as with a sescue the trials so connected with it  in pursuance of the precedent on a like occasion in it could have  proved that these Associations were part of the sys∣tem of a deeplaid conspiracy to establish military despotism  This charge it is to be observed includes all the Associations which are stated to amount to two thousand  THESE accusations bear a very close resemblance accidental or designed to the conduct of the Long Par∣liament  who were resolved to render the most consider∣able bodies of the Nation obnoxious to them  Hume vo v p    The exercise of powers  warranted by all former precedents yet not authorized by statute they declared to be ille∣gal and the persons who had assumed them delin∣quents  Ibid p      The crime indeed of delinquency they did not exactly define it is to be understood however as something inferior to that of changing our mixed Govern∣ment into a simple Monarchy and establishing a mili∣tary despotism To the latter part of the charge I have to observe it seems meant to include the subscribers to  the Yeomanry Cavalry whose different meetings were virtually Associations But as these corps were raised in pursuance of an Act of Parliament that has hi∣therto protected them from being included by name in these accusations though they appear not obscurely marked out as part at least of the Janizaries or Praeto∣rians of the new Tyranny I simply trace out the pa∣rallel between the spirit of the measure said to be at∣tempted by Opposition now and those votes of the Long Parliament strengthened by which a few vile incendiaries were able to lead the Nation into a civil war even after Government had been reformed and puri∣fied in all its branches I hope it is superfluous to at∣tempt to awaken your vigilance by a detail of the years of misery and desolation in which it involved this king∣dom but to that vigilance I must recommend to reflect duly upon the enormity of the declarations which the Papers have lately put into the mouths of some great Political Characters An obedience to temporary restrain∣ing Laws the unfortunate fruit of the necessity of the times and meant to terminate with that necessity  is held out  to the populace not as a moral duty but an act of prudence only To me these violent declarations if really deli∣vered seem not to be accounted for on any other footing than that of some confidence the speakers may entertain in the populace by whose assistance they might be able to give them effect They will not say anything was to be expected from such declarations in the place where they were delivered their object therefore was the consequen∣ces they might produce beyond the walls of a certain House and those consequences you will guard against by all your endeavours  THE Pamphlet attributed to Mr Reeves is said to con∣tain unconstitutional matter and this seems to have been admitted by an Authority which you have not frequently found reason to object to When any one steps forward in defence of a work lying under such censure some∣jealousy may be entertained of the soundness of his own principles I shall therefore say that I look upon all simple forms of Government over bodies of people nu∣merous enough to be properly called a Nation to be bad and of all compound systems that resulting from the combination of the three forms as in Britain to be best But the effect of such a Government on the happiness of society will be very different as the proportion of power enjoyed by the three may differ and I should be a decided enemy to any change in the proportion which now exists here by law and in fact as the force of each was so well determined that this pro∣portion has been preserved without any great effort of any one of the Estates against the power of either of the other two above a century a circumstance of which no example is to be found in our own Government and which shows the present proportion best adapted to the Country  I HAVE suffered the necessity I felt myself under to do away any jealousy which might rob what I have to say of its weight be it less or more to get the better of my reluctance to write one paragraph of egotism I con∣clude my Address to you with the final words of this Pamphlet This  is a season when the spirits of men whether good or bad are most in motion and all YOUR prudence is wanted to preserve us from folly and wickednessYOU therefore YOU at least watch  It is with that deference which is due to a set of mën who have already preserved legal Government in the ex∣tremity of danger and will I trust preserve it from future danger that I have the honour to subscribe myself  My Lords and Gentlemen c  Yours c c c THE AUTHOR  A DEFENCE c c  IN considering the Pamphlet which is the subject of these Observations and which has been attributed to Mr REEVES I shall first state the sentiments of the Writer on several points relating to our legal Con∣stitution In the second place the paragraph read from it by Mr Sturt will be considered on authorities of law and history To this will be added a vindication of the remaining parts of the Letter which have been cen∣sured  IT is evident from what passed in the Debates upon this tract "that a resolution of the House may be rescinded" in the same Session in which it is made I bring forward here some reasons which may be urged in favour of such a rescission of the Resolutions on this work a thing which I suppose to be perfectly in order for a Resolution being the act of one House of Parliament only it certainly is as legal for an individual to plead for its being rescinded as for the repeal of a law which is the act of the whole Parliament Beside the House of Commons are the guardians and trustees of every individual though the first term per∣haps  best implies their preeminence and duty If a guar∣dian direct a suit to be commenced in the name of any person for whom he is in trust▪ such ward may go to him and lay down his reason to induce him to withdraw it and if there were good ground for the application the lowest individual who was guardian to another would have the privilege to comply with it nor can such an assembly as the House of Commons want a privilege col∣lectively that every one possesses individually in similar cases  THE matter which may be urged against this Pamphlet I shall take from the speeches attributed to the Members of both Houses in the public prints they are the best au∣thorities people in general have to judge from and may be received as faithful enough to the principles and leading opinions though less accurate as to the words of the speakers I therefore do not from those publications quote the name of any speaker  PART I  MEN who are friends to our legal Constitution and to the spirit of it agree in all the main outlines and differ more or less only on subordinate points on which if you find two individuals agreed you will not find even a single subsection of a party all the members of which bold precisely the same opinion It is by these great outlines therefore that the constitutional principles of our Author are to be judged  IN the public prints one of the conductors of the attack on this Pamphlet is made to declare that it is part of a series of attempts to make the Crown everything and the People nothing There cannot be a fuller contradiction to this charge than certain passages contained in the work itself The powers and dignity vested in the King are declared to be sufficient for his high station in the following words We have  an hereditary King who bears all the burthen of Government who is endued  with  ALL  the power  NECESSARY  That is all that is necessary and no more  to carry it on  and who enjoys ALL  the honour and preeminence  NECESSARY TO GIVE SPLENDOR  to so high a station  P l    The word "hereditary" will possibly give a little more disgust to some than will be openly avowed but it is not necessary to guard a part where you know that your adversary in his present circumstances dares not to aim a blow therefore we will consider the only objection he will venture to bring forward The Writer he might urge for anything that here appears to the contrary may consider the right of the King as  divine and indefeasible  But I think when an author somewhat ela∣borately endeavours to limit his own terms exclusively to another and more ordinary sense than they obviously bear he is to be supposed to wish to have them understood in that sense only What that is let him lay down Now among  the high pretensions founded on visionary and refined theories  like castles in the air  I thought says this Writer that the divine indefeasible right of Kings and other fancies of former times were exploded  and he adds "because they have no warrant in law  P l  " He asserts indeed that a Monarchy is preferable to the ty∣ranny of  five hundred Republicans that govern by  their ordinances that is by their own will  But what species of Monarchy is it he here prefers to such a Re∣public That under which we are  the subjects of a King who governs by law  P l    And I observe further that by the term  law  the context requires us to understand the law of the limited Monarchy of England Some Members of the Minority I believe when they have been obliged to speak explicitly on the consequences of the French oligarchy of despots have gone a little further  So much for the foundation of the first part of the charge that the Author of this Pamphlet wishes to make the King everything Now let us see what ground there is for imputing to him a wish to make the People nothing In the fullest and most direct contradiction to this I shall show that he admits the influence of the People in terms which prove his high sense of its utility and even of the necessity of its frequent interposition Their actual influence and its utility are inferred from these words  The people of sense who look on have a great sway though not always seen in balancing the weight of parties  P l    in what terms is it that he men∣tions their consequence during every Meeting of Parlia∣ment On the deliberations of that Assembly "English∣men says he  this is a season when your superin∣tending influence is most needed and we usually see it is then most happily predominant  P l    What is the good sense of the country but the good sense of the People Does not this Writer tell us that  nothing can be brought to a successful conclusion unless it is approved by the good sense of the country  P l    Does he not call the sway it  enjoys "gentle and useful  P l  " Does he not insist at large that it has been the preservative against every party which has been engaged in bad councils  P the whole  With this the pam∣phlet begins and what was the last thought dwelling upon his mind at the conclusion  Englishmen the Parliament is now assembled  ***  You  therefore  you  at least  "watch"  Last words of Pamphlet  Such are the principles contained in a pamphlet which is part of a series of measures the second object of which is to make the People nothing  I GO on with somewhat more brevity to state other principles of this Writer On our excellent form of Government he says that it is "real and substantial"  we see and feel it we can take its height and its depth and we know its movements because they are regulated by established and known laws  and he adds  that this is the only Constitution ever supposed or named by men of sober minds and sound understanding  P l    Now this description certainly includes all that is constituted and he who adds any other things to this idea of the Constitu∣tion cannot affirm they are constituted and I would wish him for the future for the sake of logical distinctness to call all such things the  unconstituted  parts of the Constitu∣tion But we shall have to revert again to the double sense of the term Constitution whence the wildest abuses have arisen But of the Constitution established by law he says its  best title is professed to be its conformity to the principles of reason  P last line    HIS sentiments on the subject of Civil Liberty I shall introduce by observing that our noblest principles never  can be dishonoured but by actual fanaticism or by the viler hypocrisy of those men who for ends which will not bear the light put on the wildest appearance of that fana∣ticism to kindle the reality in others Impressed with this truth the Writer of the Pamphlet reprobates those  who have rendered the best things odious by THEIR corrupt contact who have made the friendly appellation of  Citizen  a badge of separation and enmity and the very name of Liberty suspected to the ear of an English∣man  P l    It would require a logic which I am not master of to find an enemy to that "best" of "things"  liberty  in the man who admits it so to be and who cen∣sures with such vigour those who have brought its name into discredit  THIS act of his political creed would be incomplete without the addition of the Writer's sentiments on that great event which placed King William on the Throne of these kingdoms This he says  was brought about by the energy good sense and firmness of some of the best and greatest men in the Nation  P l    Yet he stands charged in a supposed speech with  having written a libel on the illustrious characters who brought it about  I know of no more liberal praise that imagination could devise to give to it than to say it was in everything ade∣quate to the occasion and in nothing superfluous This he does in the following words in which he speaks of the Reformation at the same time  These memorable trans∣actions were conducted in a way that was truly English the actors in them proceeded with their re∣medy as far as the disease reached and no further  P l    and returning to the subject in another place he fully declares it to be  a precedent to be regarded with reve∣rence and with gratitude toward those who made it but which we hope never to have occasion to follow  P l    Is this ground for the House to resolve that he has written "a libel on the Revolution" that  he speaks of it with contempt  that he represents it as "a farce" for such are the charges against him by the paper speechmakers The last sentence of the above extract we sup∣pose may give reasonable grounds of unostensible though deep disgust to some of his enemies After this spirited eulogy of the great movers of the great transaction of and of the transaction itself what he says of the term Revolution is a question for a court of grammarians not of law but that will find its place to be considered He seems indeed to me to think that our science of poli∣tics may want a new nomenclature as well as that of che∣mistry but in this he must expect to be sturdily opposed to the last by the partizans of Dr Priestley and the old phlogistic theory  IT appears therefore to sum up the whole to be this Writer's sentiments that the power of the King with its legal limitations is sufficient that the Good Sense of the People has and ought to have great influence with the Legislature which influence it is their duty to exert that the events of were a remedy to the preexisting evil absolutely necessary and fully adequate to the authors of which we ought to look up with gratitude and reverence And in these sentiments extracted from the Pamphlet are fully comprised the great outlines of the real principles of our Constitution  THERE remains very little more to be said connected with this branch of my subject except that if any part of the Pamphlet shall on examination be found to bear two senses the first of which shall be found to agree with what is above laid down or any other part of the context while the second does not so agree the former sense is to be taken to be the true meaning of the author that is every part shall be so construed if possible that the whole may stand I now proceed to examine whether there is anything to be found in the remainder of this Pamphlet inconsistent with the extracts already made from it  PART II  THE Writer of the Letter I am considering has divided it into six parts as appears by the summary in the titlepage The second part is on the nature of the English Govern∣ment and it contains the paragraph said to be a libel on the Constitution To the consideration of that paragraph I shall prefix a brief analysis of what precedes it in that section together with the most material strictures reported in the papers to have been made upon it  THE King makes  Words of Legislation "the King wills it" i e by and with c  or enacts laws by and with the advice and consent of the Lords and Commons  HE executes these laws according to the verdict of a Grand and Petty Jury  THIS leads us to one simple view of the Royal Power that both in the act of Legislation and the execution of Law it is limited by two prior negatives  THIS description of the Writer seems more accurate and according to the lax sense of the term more consti∣tutional than the parallel passage in Blackstone  In England the supreme power is divided into two branches the one Legislative to wit the Parliament consisting of King Lords and Commons the other executive consisting of the King alone  Comm vol i p    HERE I have to observe that the newspapers represent a Member of one House to have declared that this Author has stated  the Constitution of this country to be an ab∣solute Monarchy  and that he has  said distinctly that the King makes laws and executes laws  totally suppressing the modifications of this power as laid down above In the same spirit was an observation there said to have been made in another House that the Writer insinu∣ates  that all personal security and property is dependent on the King  It will be contended perhaps that he admits the limitations he has described above to be parts of the Constitution  de facto  only and it may be made a question with what degree of regard he looks upon those two prior negatives of the subject on every exertion of the powers of the Sovereign In answer to this I will add a few extracts more from his Letter to those already made  He begins his book with complimenting his countrymen upon the possession of more good sense than their neigh∣bours and his leading proof of it is  that he has yet not seen  elsewhere  equal marks of it in those matters where of all others they should be manifested I mean says he in their  Laws and Government  P l    Considered in a second point of view he calls the existing Govern∣ment  an organ of public union and activity which is adapted to the  humour  and  mode of thinking  of those" *** who live under it  P l    that humour the leading quality of which he describes to be the jealousy of power with∣out the turbulent ambition of it  P l  that mode of thinking formed by the good sense of a nation whom he holds to possess more of that quality  than any other in the world  P l    And almost at the conclusion of his work impressed with the general view of the whole structure of our Government he affirms  that it is so compacted in all its parts that every conceit of politicians must vanish before it  THESE things premised I shall give at length the whole of the paragraph in which the passage objected to is found distinguishing the parts of the latter which form a distinct Proposition or imply one by breaks  I  WITH the exception therefore of the advice and consent of the two Houses of Parliament and the inter∣position of Juries the Government and the administra∣tion of it in all its parts may be said to rest wholly and solely on the King and those appointed by him  P l  Those  two adjuncts of  Parliament  and  Juries  are subsidiary and occasional but the King's power is a substantive one always visible and active By his Officers and in his name everything is transacted that relates to the peace of the realm and the protection of the subject The subject eels this and acknowledges with thankfulness a superintending sovereignty which alone is congenial with the sentiments and temper of Englishmen  II  IN FINE the Government of England is a Monar∣chy the Monarch is the antient stock from which have sprung those goodly branches of the Legislature the Lords and Commons that at the same time give orna∣ment to the tree and afford shelter to those who seek protection under it But these are still only branches and derive their origin and their nutriment from their common parent they may be lopped off and the tree is a tree still shorn indeed of its honours but not like them cast into the fire  III  The Kingly Government may go on in all its functions without Lords or Commons it has heretofore done so for years together and in our times it does so during every recess of Par∣liament but without the King  HIS  Parliament is no more  IV  The King therefore alone it is who necessarily subsists without change or diminution and from HIM alone we unceasingly derive the protection of Law and Government  THE analysis of this paragraph is as follows It consists of four parts as numbered In the first an account is given of the nature of the Royal Power in the second  the origin of the Second and Third Estates  as they now exist  and some consequences from their being so derived in the third he compares the legal powers of the King and the Two Estates with regard to one quality or accident of their operation that is their perpetuity and in the fourth he reverts to the substantive power of the King affirmed in the first  THE mode in which the citation was made from the whole of the paragraph was this The whole second part was taken and from the first period of the third the first colon or member being cut off was applied to what pre∣cedes as if explanatory thereof  THIS mode therefore of quoting a passage for censure is highly censurable for on such occasions so much ought to be quoted as to exhibit the full and perfect meaning of the Writer and the colon with which the citation ends in∣dicates the sense of the last part to be not completed A com∣mon English Grammar may be cited for this where we read that when  a member of a sentence which of it self would make a complete sentence and so requires a greater pause than a semicolon yet is followed by an additional part making a more full and perfect sense may be dis∣tinguished by a colon  Lowth's Grammar p    But beyond this colon the accusers of the LetterWriter did not read though three sentences follow in the period to limit and explain the meaning of the first which they severed from them in the citation  THE additional colon has likewise another mark of severance from what precedes it it contains abstract mat∣ter all that precedes it is metaphorical therefore there  was a full pause of the sense before it and it can connect only with what follows it But when this colon or in∣completed meaning was cut off from the period of which it is a part and joined to the last sentence of the former it was deduced from it that the Writer meant to affirm  that the Lords and Commons may be lopped off without impairing the Constitution  or as it was said in ano∣ther place that the Constitution so lopped  might and would be complete  It is thus that by an illegitimate mode of quotation the passage censured is rendered un∣couth and then in consequence of some illegitimate rea∣son which the reporters of these debates have entirely concealed and which cannot be divined it is further ren∣dered criminal  I HAD not had an opportunity of seeing this passage in the original work when the following Observations were drawn up In them therefore it will be found that it is taken for granted that the quotation was properly made I now therefore proceed to shew that everything contained in the passage as cited for censure is strictly true both on historical and legal evidence  I DIVIDE the whole matter it contains into three Pro∣positions which shall be severally proved the two which are positive are placed first As I find the ground taken for these proofs is the same as that referred to by the LetterWriter when he enters at all upon proof these coincidences will be noted in his own words in the margin  PROPOSITION I The second and third Estate owe their origin to the Crown or have sprung out of the Monarchy  PROPOSITION II The continuance of the functions of the Houses is temporary that of those of the Crown perpetual  PROPOSITION III The LEGAL capacity of action may be taken from the Houses by violence the effect of which may subsist some time after the violence is removed but at all times the legal capacity of action remains in the Crown  OR the actors of such violence at any period ac∣quiring permanent power the Peerage of a country and the families from which the Thrid Estate was then taken may become effectively extinct while a succession of Kings  de jure  may more probably be preserved many ages if not cut off by an act of abdication by an ancestor in  possession  from whom they derive  I am afraid the censure of the passage would have been much aggravated if the Author had added as a conclusion to it  The King is superior to both Houses in dignity  yet this is laid down as a principle by Blackstone v p    THIS is the whole abstract matter of the paragraph the truth of the two general principles is to be shown from good law authorities and where necessary from the reason of the thing and the possibility or absolute truth of the facts asserted from history particularly that of England  The matters contained in the extract the Writer states to be such  as can be demonstrated from the incontestable evidence of history  and records  Page Where I looked for his defence thither I find he has referred all his readers The points of law to be quoted will be taken from "Blackstone's Commentaries" which a Noble Lord in opposition at the time when this matter was agitated speak∣ing of another subject declared it to be the duty of every Magistrate to study The edition made use of is that of in vo and as Hume is quoted as evidence by the censurers of the Letter I shall take my principal historical authorities from him vo and the former writer    PROPOSITION I  THE Second and Third Estates have sprung out of the Monarchy This is the abstract sense of the follow∣ing parts of the passage  The Monarch is the an∣cient stock from which have sprung those goodly branches of the Legislature the Lords and Com∣mons but these are still only branches and derive their origin and nutriment from their common parent  I CONSIDER this point first Historically secondly Legally thirdly It will be shewn that this order of the parts of a mixed Government coming into existence is better than the contrary one  HISTORICAL PROOF  WITH respect to the Peers this is evidently true for the date of the creation of almost every Barony may be assigned  WITH respect to the Commons the Sovereigns of Europe formed Corporations to balance the powers of the Barons and gathered the Representatives of such Corpo∣rations and those of provincial districts together in a Third Estate still better to counterpoise the power of the Barons who had before the advantage of an union of force  IN England this period was forwarded some years only by the Earl of Leicester pretending to act in the name of the King Upon the fall of that nobleman the conti∣nuance and stability of the House of Commons was fa∣voured by the Crown through the policy described above even though  "planted by so unauspicious a hand"  Hume year This form of government dif∣fered very much from that established by our Saxon an∣cestors their Wittenagemote by all the accounts which we have of it resembled what has subsisted down to our day in France under the name of the  Assembly of Notables  it was sometimes held before the people but Bacon in his "Historical Disquisitions" leans to the opinion that they had no voice therein such a body he observes  would be as monstrous as the Anthropo∣phagi whose heads were too near their bellies to be wise  Page    II FROM LAW AUTHORITIES  IT will not be denied even by those who were the most violent in their censures of the Letter that the Sovereignty rests in the Legislature of which the King is  Caput  PRINCIPIUM  et Finis  Inst Stat El c Hale of Parl from Black Com vol p  HENCE it appears to be a maxim of the law of England that the Crown is the  principium  the source or origin of each legal Parliament individually and consequently was so of the first and the Law of England is descriptive of the Constitution of England which no other writing is  per se  for the Law is what is constituted and nothing but what is so constituted is of the Constitution  WE may add some supplementary authorities here the Convention Parliament of assembled without the King's writ after his return an Act passed declaring this to be a good Parliament C c the next con∣firmed its Acts C c c Bl Com b c It was then held by many that the assent of the King whose authority alone was wounded could not heal the defect of the Acts of their assembly If there had been a vacancy of the Throne this authority vesting in no one could re∣ceive no wound and the confirmation of their Acts would have been unnecessary In the ratification of the Acts of the first by the second Parliament this Assembly was guided by its ideas of the theory of law and nothing can be said against the competency of their general deci∣sions on such points I state it on the authority of Blackstone that they left to the next only one Act to make to carry public law "to theoretical perfection" the Habeas Corpus Act  though the following years were times of great practical oppression  Bl v p    THE following seems likewise to me a fact of great weight The Peers and Gentlemen who had espoused the cause of William in answer to a message of James to that Prince demanded that the writs which he had issued to summon a Parliament should be superseded  We may drive away the King said the Prince but it is not so easy to come by a Parliament  Clarendon's Diary in Macpherson's History v p    The demand was changed for that of a free Parliament  Burnet's Occasional Serm  ns Pref p Edit  Hence it is evident that this reasoning at that time met the princi∣ples of those great men who brought about the Revolution and of King William himself I step out of my way here to observe that from these words I draw a consequence totally contrary to that deduced by Macpherson they imply that King William did not then wish for the abdi∣cation of James But to return to the subject the ulti∣mate decision of William's Council appears at that instant to have been legally right but they were soon reduced by the flight of James under another law the  jus extremae necessitatis  and in that state the summoning a Convention was absolutely legal according to its proper code but then they proceeded by the nearest possible approximation to the old forms  III FROM POLITICAL PRINCIPLES  THE best constituted mixed Monarchies are those in which the Estates have sprung out of the Monarchy this shall be proved by authority by abstract reason and by history    From Authority  MONARCHY says Lord Bolingbroke comparing the simple forms of Government is to be preferred to other Governments because you can better ingraft any description of Republic on a Monarchy than anything of Monarchy upon the Republican forms  From Burke's "Reflections" th edit p    Abstract Reasoning  IT is not necessary to understand here that a simple Monarchy is the best simple Government to have lived under antecedent to the change to a mixed Monarchy the conclusion will not be weakened if it be admitted to be a bad inn in a dirty village but from which the best road leads to a fine place you are desirous to go to for it is to be observed that a mixed Government generated out of a simple Monarchy may admit the same quantity of political liberty and a greater degree of personal free∣dom than if generated from a simple Republic for the antecedent habit of allegiance and subordination being greater while it continues supported by the consideration of the legal origin of the Estates the coercion of laws may be less or personal freedom greater and the same general regularity be produced    Historical Evidence  WE are now to examine this principle by induction or the experiments thereon recorded in history an evidence in these matters superior to any furnished by abstract principles  THE first example is that of the Roman Republic In the speech of Galba in Tacitus it is said that the Empire could not be held together without a single person at the head of it I look upon this profound politician as the author of the speech and the principle as deduced by him from a retrospective view of the Roman History This single person was in power though not in title a Monarch established by an armed force The new system established by Augustus was a  disguised  arbitrary power and the administration at least after his time tyrannical in the extreme  ENGLAND was in the last century after the death of Charles I reduced to a Republic verging to anarchy A single person in power a Monarch was established by an armed force the new system was that of arbitrary power  less disguised  than that of Rome under Augustus the trials of the state criminals were by high courts of jus∣tice without juries  Hume vol p  the Asiatic system of despotism was introduced the country being divided into districts under Major Generals who had power to decimate the incomes not of the Royalists only but also of other in∣dividuals and who levied the taxes imposed by the Protec∣tor's Council of Fifteen  Ibid p  they were laid aside by him two years before his death That he continued his arbi∣trary taxation to the last is evident for the grants of his last Assembly amounted to l for a year only and it does not appear that any taxes were voted to raise even that sum  Ibid p  but he levied in taxes upon an average two million yearly  Ibid p  His administration was rigid at least to the measure of his state necessity  THESE are examples of the government of a single person ingrafted upon a Republic by the assistance of an armed force degenerating into tyranny we pass on to those which have seemingly had a more promising origin  HOLLAND though not in name yet in effect was a limited Monarchy both under its elective and hereditary Stadtholders or a limited Monarchy arising out of a Republican Constitution that it was effectively such a Monarchy we have the authority of King William who called himself Stadtholder of England and King of Hol∣land  IN this State there were effected four Revolutions in years ending in the office of Stadtholder was twice suppressed by edict and twice restored by popular insurrections for a purpose which will presently be seen it is here noted that the mean interval between two Revo∣lutions was fortyfour years and a half  BESIDES these between the establishment of the Repub∣lic and the year four other Revolutions were very nearly effected The first by Prince Maurice the second by his grandson William the third when the City of Amsterdam invited Prince Casimir to set up against King William which he declined and the fourth when the present Prince of Orange was expelled from the Hague in Thus in years there were eight Revolutions effected or nearly effected and the mean interval between the imminent hazard of one Revolution and another was twentyseven years and a half  THE longest term of fixed government in that country was from the death of King William to the year or for the term of fortyfive years  IT is to be noted that the primary cause of these Revo∣lutions was the power of a single person being grafted upon a Republic but there is one principle which a com∣mercial Republic will adopt which will greatly accelerate the fall of the mixed form they may be desirous to intro∣duce or destroy its stability but as it arises out of the simple form in such a State and as all Republics tend thereto I shall not lengthen these cursory observations with any further notice of it  THE fourth example will be the French Constitution of The fiction was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of grafting a Monarchy upon a Republic all appearances of the principles of the former were soon an∣nihilated by the change of opinion introduced by this novel principle and by force jointly This Constitution  nominally  lasted one year  I DECLINE adding more instances not to lengthen this part of the tract Of the four examples of mixed Mo∣narchies rising out of a Republic two terminated in des∣potism one was perpetually exposed to Revolutions and the fourth ended almost as soon as it arose in anarchy  IT is to be observed that all debates upon this question must proceed upon a supposition that it is in our choice out of which of the two forms of simple Government we  will originate a mixed Monarchy If a General had pos∣sessed himself of two gates of a town which he wanted to occupy in the streets leading from one of which he had few or no obstacles to expect but he knew that in the quarter into which the other opened all of them were enfiladed by cannon were guarded by barricades and full of covered pits and wolfholes and the houses on each side of the way occupied by musqueteers there is little difficulty to determine which entrance he ought to prefer  THIS question certainly cannot pass off without the Constitution of America being introduced into it There is certainly something of limited Monarchy to be found in the office of President but no conclusion can yet be drawn from it it has not been established long enough for its latent vices if any such exist to break out Experience shews us there was no principle of stability in the Con∣stitution of Holland yet the mean interval between one actual Revolution and another was fortyfour years and a half and between a Revolution effected or nearly effect∣ed twentyseven years and a quarter That of America has not yet stood the shorter of those periods experience has not therefore proved this Constitution to be as stable as even that of Holland was besides something like smoke has been before and is now discernibly breaking out of some crevices of the building  DIVISION says an eminent American writer is a calamity which we have more occasion to sear and I see with infinite regret that obstinate factions are be∣ginning to be formed to what degree they may pro∣ceed in decomposing and dissolving the present harmo∣nious  system can be known only to God and to pos∣terity  Sermon at a Public Thanksgiving preached at Philadelphia Feb by Dr Stanhope Smith VicePersident c c in the College of New Jersey  IT is stated in the censured passage that the two Branches receive their nutriment as well as origin from their Parent Tree This circumstance is left out of the abstract proposition formed to take in the whole of the rest If it can be supposed to want a particular defence it may be said that the continuance of the prosperity of every order in the State depends on the exercise of the legal power of the King in whose  name every thing is transacted that relates to the peace of the realm and the protection of the subject  Letter p l    Besides the number of the Members of the Upper House would continually de∣crease by the successive extinction of Peerages if the Crown did not keep its numbers up by new creations and thus as in the human frame the Constitution would perish by the inanition of one of its vital parts  PROPOSITION II THE continuance of the functions of the Houses is tem∣porary and that of those of the Crown perpetual  IN the interval between two Parliaments neither of the Houses can be said to exist there are no Representatives and as no Parliament exists no Peers of Parliament these would be Peers of a nonentity and even while a  Parliament exists the functions of the two Houses are not permanently necessary those of the Crown are their commencement and conclusion depend upon the will of the King being summoned and prorogued by him during the life of the person who holds the Crown the discontinuance of the exercise of his functions de∣pends by the Constitution on the act of God alone as in demise by illness c or his own will declared by an act of abdication  WHEN the military establishments of the Sovereigns of Europe were on so limited a scale as to give no jealousy for the safety of these kingdoms and we had not taken our place in the great Northern Commonwealth of States which happened at the period of the Revolution we wanted no annual establishment of what may be called an army of observation no annual land and malt tax hence "heretofore" though Kingly Government was permanently necessary Parliaments were not assembled "for years together  Letter p l  " In the Bill of Rights it was en∣acted that Parliaments should be held frequently but the term  frequently  being indefinite by the statute Will Mary c it was declared  that a new Parliament should be called within three years after the determi∣nation of the former  Bl v p This is the present legal Constitution I only remark this to shew that the LetterWriter has not urged all the legal proofs he might have adduced of the superior permanency of the Royal functions  BLACKSTONE says "that the King" is the only branch of the  Legislature that has a separate existence and is capable of performing  any act  at a time when no Par∣liament is in being  Bl v p  The LetterWriter in the passage here considered asserts that  the Kingly Government may go on in all  its functions  without Lords or Commons  THE second extract seems to be taken from the first the Commentaries have never been censured as an uncon∣stitutional book by Parliament on the contrary the work is there frequently quoted as a book of reference The greatest difference between the passages is the substitution of the word  function  for the more general term  act  and the first is more definitely constitutional than the second for a function is the performance of a thing limited and prescribed or the power of so doing it mostly signifies ministration in some legal office including the notion of some prior or external obligation when it is applied to a moral agent and this obligation must arise either from a compact or voluntary engagement or the lawful com∣mand of a superior the word itself is not applicable to the act of an unlimited agent  WE find the DictionaryWriters rendering the Latin word  officium  the primary meaning of which is  duty  by the word  function  and on the other hand  fungor  is trans∣lated in its primary signification  to discharge an office or duty  and again "to conform to" a prescribed mode and  functio  in its primary signification they render the execution of a  charge  It became also a technical term in the  Roman Law and then signified the discharge of a debt not in specie but by some presentation of equal value as in commodities labour c  THE similitude of the subject and of the manner in which it is to be treated renders it not improper here to enter into the consideration of what is to be found fur∣ther in the Letter relating to the Royal power which has not been considered before or will not become the subject of the next Proposition Those points I shall state in the Writer's own words in one column and overagainst them those of Blackstone  LETTER  COMMENTARIES  WITH the exception of the advice and consent of the two Houses of Parlia∣ment and the interposition of Juries  the Government and the administration of it in all its parts may be said to rest wholly and solely on the King  and those appointed by him Page l  AFTER what has been premised in this chapter the Limitations on the Crown I shall not I trust be con∣sidered as an advocate for arbitrary power when  I lay it down as a principle that in the exertion of lawful preroga∣tive the King is and ought to be absolute  that is so far ab∣solute that there is no legal authority that can either delay or resist him Bl v p     THE King of England is not only the chief  but pro∣perly the sole Magistrate of the nation  all others acting in commission from and in due subordination to him  Ibid  IT is to be concluded from this that the principle laid down in the Letter would not in the judgment of Judge Blackstone shew the Writer an advocate for arbitrary power He continues thus  LETTER  COMMENTARIES  THOSE two adjuncts of Parliament and Juries are  subsidiary  and occasional Page l  WE are to consider the King with regard to his Councils for in order to  assist  him in the discharge of his duties the Law has as∣signed him a diversity of Councils to advise with     THE first of these is the High Court of Parliament Bl v  HERE we see the High Court of Parliament stated to be  subsidiary  or  assistant  to the King terms of the same im∣port The LetterWriter seems to consider its functions to be to  inform the King's legislative will  and that of Juries  to inform his executive conscience  placing the first in the rank it is ordinarily held and the latter somewhat higher  In addition to what I have said above it may be reobserved that the point of view in which this writer has placed the two limi∣tations of the Royal Power shews that quality in that part of the plan of our Constitution considered apart from its effects which is called unity of design  He further after having admitted its limita∣tions goes on thus  LETTER  COMMENTARIES  BUT  the King's power is a substantive one  always visible and activeAnd again p l  The King alone it is who necessarily subsists  with∣out change or diminution  PREROGATIVES are either direct or incidental the direct are such  positive and substantial parts  of the Royal character and authority as are rooted in and spring from the King's political person considered merely by itself without reference to any other extrinsic circum∣stance V p And first of "  these substantive  or "direct  prerogatives  " he names the Royal character or dignity  Ibid  p  THE latter part of each of these quotations from the Letter relates to the perpetuity of the exercise of the Royal func∣tions which has been before considered If the whole of what Blackstone has said of the substantive power of the Crown could have had a place here the following con∣clusion would have been apparent That in every point hitherto compared the last but one excepted he has ex∣pressed himself in stronger and fuller terms on the dignity of the Crown than this Writer and in the excepted in∣stance with equal force  PROPOSITION III EVEN the legal capacity of acting may be taken from the Houses by violence the effect of which must sub∣sist some time after the violence is removed but at  all times the legal capacity of action remains in the Crown  FIRST To avoid the necessity of repetition I note here once for all that throughout this article it is to be taken for granted that no act of abdication has taken place on the part of the King  THE legal capacity of the Houses to act depends upon their being assembled which may be prevented by the violence stated and after such violence is removed some interval of time must pass before they can be legally re∣assembled by the Crown and the term may extend so long that the Parliament which was in existence at its commencement may be brought to an end by the act of the law before such force is removed But the legal powers of the Crown will not be so extinguished although it be impossible to exert them in act  BEFORE I consider the second part or sense of this Pro∣position I transcribe the passage in the paragraph in which it is found  THEY the Lords and Commons are only branches and derive their origin and nutriment from the com∣mon parent they may be lopped off and the Tree is a Tree still shorn indeed of its honours but not like them cast into the fire  I shall afterwards consider the expression and prove the following with what has preceded to be the only senses of it having made one observation in this place on the style Through the whole of the Letter it is equable though correct and even ele∣gant without those bolder figures which prose on some occasions may admit The passage which is censured  taken without the last sentence severed from the follow∣ing period is perfectly insulated it looks like a single hill starting up out of a plain whose surface is indeed waving and diversified Thus placed we meet a passage highly metaphorical and continued to a considerable length Who would not pronounce in such a case where a Writer departs from his own manner that the cause was some sudden and strong impression on his mind operating at the moment though he suppresses the mention of it and there are recent circumstances of that kind dwelling in every man's mind Is the passage very different from a portrait of the situation of Louis XVI when a limited Sovereign in the last year of his reign Nobility abo∣lished by a law he was compelled to assent to and even every man of the Third Estate distinguished by virtue and ability was driven into exile or at least forced to fly from the Assembly The goodly branches of the Legislature were lopped off the Tree remained indeed in name a Tree still shorn of its honours and not  yet  like them cast into the fire Or to come to the immediate instant when we must suppose the paragraph to have been written Was not the King of France then in exile her Nobility half exterminated half begging sustenance in foreign countries or Were the Commons of the realm represented by the vile instruments of Robespierre Barrere or Tallien Hence the Writer will be thought to have had at that time before his eye that dreadful calamity in which the Nobles and the more opulent and respectable individuals of the commonalty were involved and the annihilation rapidly advancing upon them and perhaps his more eager censurers may become inclined to admit if they can suppose it  possible only  that he wrote with such impressions that he did not look upon the philosophical politics of lopping  and burning and the sublime process of regenerating by annihilating with an unconstitutional approbation This premised I come to the second sense of the pas∣sage  SECONDLY The actors of such violence at any period acquiring permanent power the Peerage of a country and the families from which the Third Estate was then taken may become effectively extinct while a succession of Kings  de jure  may probably be preserved for many ages  A FAMILY is said to be effectively extinct when it has no known representative no one who can establish himself to be such upon proof We learn from Caesar that the feudal system was established among the Gauls whose institutions those of the Britons perfectly resem∣bled They too had their order of Nobility or Lords  Bacon's Hist Disc  but their Nobility is totally extinct And the same is true of the Saxon Nobility and greater Gentry we have no Peers with a Saxon title and few Gentry who can shew themselves descendants of an opulent Saxon family Those ornamental branches of the Royalty of the British and Saxon line have by the violence of the sword of the successive conquerors of the kingdom been lopped off and cast into the fire while the fortune of the parent stem was little attended to as we shall see on decisive authority hereafter  I do not think that any Deputies of the Commons formed a part of the Saxon Great Councils He that shall prove this opinion to be erroneous will strengthen the cause of the LetterWriter on the one hand more than he will weaken it on the other by furnishing a proof that the popular branch may be cut off by violence and that the monarchical Trunk may preduce a new one even after the lapse of two Centuries    BUT the extermination of the Lords and the greater families of the Commons has not been in this country and in latter ages possible only it is a danger which in the opinion of the most judicious modern historian Mr Hume has been very probable has been suspended over their heads by a very slender thread indeed At the end of his account of the Restoration he observes that  the violence of the English Parties exceeded anything we can now imagine had they continued but a little longer there was just reason to dread all the horrors of the antient massacres and proscriptions  from  the military usurpers  V p    IF Providence had at that time visited the Nation with this dreadful yet probable calamity the Writer asserts the tree would have remained a tree still for it shall be shown that a case resembling this is the only one he could have had in contemplation when he wrote If this tragedy had been effected it is paying no undeserved tri∣bute to the moral sense of the lower orders in this coun∣try to say that the perpetrators would have been held in such execration that the supposition of their being fa∣vourable to a Restoration is no violent assumption In that case by the legal prerogatives attached to and still re∣maining in the person of the King according to the Au∣thor's assertions a House of Peers might have been formed and by his writs a lawful House of Commons assembled and he would have been legally able to have formed the wheels and set together again the whole machine of Government Thus by the operation of the Law of the Land as adequate a remedy as possible would have  been found for such a calamity a better source to derive it from than the  jus extremae necessitatis  or the supposition that the Civil Government was quite dissolved And only such a case as this it must be granted the writer had in his eye For when he supposed such an exter∣mination he must have supposed it effected by some agent or agents by the King or by rebels or foreign force The first it is incredible he should think lightly of the second we have recently seen at∣tempted and almost effected the last does not enter into the question  THE King  de jure  Charles II being abroad would have escaped this calamity shorn of his branches but not like them cast into the fire and in the kingdoms where the principle of Salic Law is not in force the Royal Families mostly marrying their daughters to foreign Princes events of which faithful records are preserved are not nearly so liable to become apparently extinct as even the existing classes of Nobility and Gentry  A VERY singular instance of the truth of this occurs in our own history The title of the British Sovereigns was in the Welch Princes By the marriage of Gladys sister of Llewellyn ap Jorwerth the Great their title ultimately fell into the house of Mortimer Thus Ed∣ward the IVth united the Norman title in the York line with that of the British Princes By the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth with Henry heir of the line of Lancaster there was an union of three titles in their de∣scendants which at last vesting in those of her daugh∣ter Margaret Queen of Scotland the Crown passed to James the Ist and in his person a fourth title was added  to the former three Margaret daughter of Edward the Outlaw son of Edmund Ironside married to Malcolm King of Scotland she was sister to Edgar Atheling  cui de jure  says Matthew Paris  debebatur regnum An∣glorum  He died without issue and thus after an interval of years the lineal representative of Edmund Ironside was seated on the English throne uniting in his single person the claims of the British the Saxon the York and the Lancaster lines The particulars of this descent here given I have taken out of Blackstone b i c He remarks that this accumulation of titles sug∣gested to a Prince of more learning than wisdom that his hereditary title was indefeasible and it may be added that those of his age and for a considerable time after who were most zealously attached to our Liberty and Laws which are ultimately derived from the Saxon race might in their affection to the memory of those excellent Sovereigns to whom they were indebted for them think they discovered the immediate hand of Providence in the restoration of this line and even carry the consequences they deduced from it to an erroneous length  IN a word the heir of Edmund Ironside Llewellyn the Great and William the Norman in the Protestant line is now seated on the Throne But is there a single person to be found in the kingdom who can shew him∣self to be the representative of a British or a Saxon Lord or many who can derive their descent from the Saxon Gentry These classes have twice become ex∣tinct The representative of the dynasties wears the Crown  PART III ON THE DICTION OR EXPRESSION OF THE PARAGRAPH  IT is necessary to be unusually particular in the re∣marks upon this topic because the circumstance of the Pamphlet being made the subject of Parliamentary inquiry seems to me to hang much upon it The greatest part of it is metaphorical and one of the metaphors has I pre∣sume given offence to many of the Members of the House who have voted upon the subject  THE Lords and Commons are described as branches springing from the antient stock of Monarchy the ho∣nours of the tree goodly and giving it ornament and affording shelter to those who take protection under it Here is much said of the utility and beauty of the Estates and the matter of their origination being true which was proved above their good qualities are as warmly painted as we usually find them and perhaps it may be said to be more so  To meet the objection to be considered afterwards it becomes necessary here to observe that all this imagery is of the school of the Hebrew poetry a secondary mark of the peculiar genius of which was to confine some particular metaphors almost exclusively to certain subjects as a cedar or any majestic tree to express a King or Prince The image is of this sort If any one should say that its proximate source is to be found in Shakespear  in a poetical compliment to James the Ist I shall not dis∣pute it with him  He shall flourish  And like a mountain cedar reach his branches  To all the plains about him  BUT I must have the liberty of adding Hurd's Note on this passage  It is easy to see his cedar is not of English growth but transplanted from Judea  Hurd's Horace v p    THE subject leads the Writer to add another circumstance to this description the abstract matter of which is that the Three Estates may be destroyed but the Monarch remain As he began metaphori∣cally this he has rightly expressed in the same manner Yet in this second metaphor is to be found one great part and I believe the principal part of the ground of the censure This destruction is thus expressed  The branches may be lopped offand cast into the fire  The charge certainly is not weakened by thus removing these phrases out of their places and putting them into uxtaposition  j  IN this metaphor the word  may  is capable of being construed in two senses the first limited to a simple pos∣sibility of the thing the second that it is not only possi∣ble but right to be done Now when a word bears two senses and there are few in common use which do not the meaning in which the writer intends to be understood is to be determined by the context In which sense  the verb  may  is here used is to be gathered from what he has said of the qualities of the two branches Now as their utility and beau  y have been warmly painted as has been particularly shewn before it is to be construed in the first sense that the branches may eventually or possibly happen to be lopped off and cast into this fire not that they ought to be so because they do not produce good fruit  YET in these two phrases as they are here put toge∣ther the Writer has copied one verbally and only made a slight alteration in the words of another from the conclusion of a beautiful allegory which is a fine exam∣ple of the Hebrew school  Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit  is hewn down and cast into the fire  The words of the latter part of this quotation may recall the former to memory but it has been par∣ticularly shewn above that the Writer did not mean that these branches did not bring forth good fruit for such fruits he has specified and even supposing this had not been capable of such proof it would be rightly said that the adoption of images in this mode forms a kind of cento in prose but when a man is composing a cento if he takes the last hemistich of a verse in Virgil to con∣clude his own is it to be supposed that he means the for∣mer part to be understood before it  BUT it will be asked  Was it not enough for this writer to have once expressed figuratively the destruc∣tion of the two Estates Was it not sufficiently de∣scribed by the phrase  they may be lopped off  Why does he affectedly repeat it dwelling on the idea and  add as if in contempt  they may be cast into the fire  To this it is answered that it is that quality of the figurative style of the Hebrew school which may be called its essential difference to give that impression to its images by reduplication which the Europeans effect by epithets I take this from Lowth's Praelections on the Hebrew Poetry and I translate his Latin Exam∣plest My instruction shall descend as a showerd My speech shall fall as the dewd As the fine showers on the plantsth As the thick dew drops on the grass  I HAVE but a single metaphorical sentence more in the citation to remark upon The branches being lop∣ped off  "the tree is a tree still shorn indeed of its honours"  How he formed the idea has been pointed out before it must now be shown where he had his colouring This ima∣gery has a different source from the former but blends very well with it Here we may infallibly detect the passage or passages of a great Poet whom the writer had in his eye and they will give us the picture then pre∣sent to his mind of the state of a monarch whose greater subjects were involved in such utter ruin The impres∣sions they make upon us were the impressions he felt when he wrote and endeavoured to excite in us by the allusion to be pointed out I need not quote Hurd's th or th marks of imitation to prove that the phrase "shorn of its honours" is borrowed from Milton it suggests to us directly the picture  Of glory obscur'd as when the sun new risen  Looks through the horizontal misty a  r  SHORN OF HIS BEAMS or from behind the moon  In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds  On half the Nations  and with fear of change  Perplexes Monarchs  AND in the same page fifteen lines further by the h  re change of the singular number for the plural we read  How he stands  His glory withered As when heaven's fire  Has scathed a forest oak or mountain pine  With finged top his stately growth though bare  Stands on the blasted heath  FROM these two passages the Writer most probably took the whole of that here considered  the tree is a tree still shorn indeed of its honours  branches and the latter might suggest to him to add what immediately follows "but not like them cast into the fire" The first sentence of the passage quoted is left simple pro∣bably to avoid the appearance of servile imitation or the giving to the whole an air of poetry too much above the customary style in which subjects of the nature of his pamphlet are generally treated  THE conclusion I draw from the whole is that in this paragraph we have the advantages of the two Houses fairly stated and the dignity of the Sovereign more fully insisted on yet from circumstances proved by general ex∣perience and law and if either of the other two parts of the Constitution had been now attempted to be sub∣verted any one of its advocates and I hope they would have been numerous zealous and able ought to have proceeded in the same manner that is briefly but fully  acknowledging the utility of the two unattacked parts then directing all his attention to the defence of the third Whether it were the Commons or the Lords it would then be doubtless pretended as it is now when so many engines are at work to weaken or destroy the Crown that no attack was intended against that parti∣cular part of the Constitution But it is to be observed with respect to such cases that it has very frequently happened when one army has marched out of its tren∣ches in the dark to attack another they have lighted up every tent to make their adversaries believe that they were very quietly at supper And if it be still constitu∣tional to defend the Government established by law it is constitutional to give a summary of the Royal pre∣rogatives acknowledged by it and point out their utility This must be allowed by those who feel themselves in∣clined to stop somewhat short of the doctrine of Black∣stone as the Writer actually has done who says  the mass of mankind will be apt to grow insolent and re∣fractory if taught to consider their Prince as a man of no greater perfection than themselves The law therefore ascribes to the King in his high political cha∣racter not only large power and emoluments which form his prerogative and revenue but likewise certain attributes of a great and transcendant nature by which the people are led to consider him in the light of a superior being and to pay him that awful respect which may enable him with greater ease to carry on the business of Government This he adds is what I understand by the Royal dignity  V p    And this de∣fence has been so conducted by the LetterWriter that the  strength of Blackstone's expression quoted frequently as unsuspected authority in both Houses appears almost perpetually lowered by him If therefore the Pamphlet be as it was described in the House of Commons  a prac∣tical Exhortation addressed to the Plain Sense of the People  there appears to lie no crimination against the Parts hitherto considered Whether any criminating matter is to be found in the remainder we are now to proceed briefly to enquire  PART IV FIRSTON THE REVOLUTION PART OF THE WORK  I NOW come to consider what the LetterWriter has said on the Revolution a motion having been made in the House to declare this also a libel In the First Part of this Tract it has been shewn that he had spoken of that even with all the warmth of praise It certainly therefore is not doing him great justice to sever the remainder which is judged unexceptionable from that context and consider it apart yet such is the me∣thod here adopted in his defence most favorable to his accusers and least so to the accused  OMITTING all those kinds of revolutions of States whose causes or effects are external our observations must be directed to civil or internal revolutions and these are of the following kinds First those which change the form of Government Secondly the gover∣nors these are simple revolutions or in the third place both conjointly or compound revolutions Infinite varieties fall under the third head As for instance a compound revolution may fix a new Dynasty upon the throne and the first principles of the old form of Go∣vernment and the Laws may undergo a very great or total change Or it may fix a family derived from a new common stock upon the throne while the changes in the form of the old Government and the Laws are much less than in the former case and such as do not  per se  approach to a revolution of the other kind  EVERY friend of legal liberty must unreservedly ap∣prove of the transactions which placed William and Mary on the throne as just and necessary but fully im∣pressed with that sentiment men may so far differ as to number the Revolution among events either of the first or the second kind and  in so doing traduce or libel the Revolution  THERE are authorities on both sides I shall state what I look upon as the best and begin with those for the first opinion  IN the Declaration of Rights Mr Hume says all the points which had of late years been disputed be∣tween King and People were finally determined and the powers of the Royal Prerogative were more nar∣rowly circumscribed and more exactly defined than in any former period of the English Government  Hume v p    It does not indeed follow from this that the disputable points were many or few the remedy of more or less ex∣tent the change of the legal form of Government con∣siderable only or intitled to be called a total change therein His idea of the magnitude of that change is to be found in the following passage  That great event the Revolution not only put a period to the hereditary succession of the house of Stuart but made a new set∣tlement of the whole Constitution  Ib v p    I LOOK upon the opinion that we had no Constitu∣tion until the Revolution or that  that  event drew it out of the chaos in which it was involved to have been derived from these and some other passages of Mr Hume's works at least I know no other respectable source of such an opinion According to that we are to suppose that he understoo  Declaration or Bill of Rights to be the "Corinthian capital  Burke on the French Revolution  " wanted still to finish that column of British Freedom the Constitu∣tion and complete the most beautiful ordonnance that human art had ever formed Yet on this occasion he only says of it at such a time such a member was put upon the top of the shaft without any account of its form or proportion while he describes certain parts of  the pedestal and base and their mouldings and orna∣ments with the most minute detail and attention I say if he thought thus of the Bill of Rights contrary to his ordinary manner he has in the body of his History which concludes with the first quotation given only seven lines to an account of it in general terms On the occasion of some former ameliorations of the Con∣stitution which he must have esteemed as of much less consequence he has been infinitely more particular His known manner is on treating on such subjects to state every topic that could be urged by a profound politician on both sides and he practically shews us that Tacitus has been indebted to warm imaginations for some part of the praises he has received And would not such a wri∣ter have been glad to have concluded his History with so fine and so important a close as a finished dissertation on the vicious redundances which remained to be taken away and the improvements to be adopted to complete a Constitution held in such esteem by a Declaration of Rights claimed on a change of the succession to the throne Does he not scorn thus even to apply a capital to the best column of his own immorta∣lity Instead of doing this we find no one article of its contents not one argument for or against it he con∣denses the account of it into a single period of seven lines while to the Petition of Rights brought forward in the reign of Charles the First the articles of which are not so many in number he has given twenty pages  V pp inclusive  containing the Petition at length some full and fine ex∣tracts from the debates and an elaborate dissertation of his own for and against it From this circumstance  some people may be inclined to think that he felt he could not give the Declaration the same consequence with which he had treated the Petition though they may keep back their assent from the opinion of Macpherson on the former who says  that the Rights that were claimed had been recognized in the most arbitrary reigns though they were sometimes evasively in∣vaded  History v p    THAT something must be subtracted from the weight Mr Hume's authority gives to the position that the Revolution  made a new settlement of the whole Con∣stitution  in the sense in which it is commonly un∣derstood appears likewise on another ground In com∣menting on the usurpations and illegal acts of the house of Stuart▪ later authors had thought fit to judge and con∣demn them on the laws and the principles now universally established This proceeding he contends to be analogous to trying a man by an  ex post facto  law This is true in many instances in respect to the first two sovereigns of that family But he did not sufficiently consider what great approaches were made in the first part of the reign of Charles the Second toward that Constitution we have now the happiness to enjoy Hence in the last of these passages he seems to hold out the idea that the nation passed  per saltum  at a single step from the old and con∣fused system almost as it existed under the last of the Tudors to the new and settled form of Government His ground for an apology for the house of Stuart is happy but his affection for it has drawn him to a cer∣tain length into the error opposite to that which he attacks and although his deviations be by no means so  gross as those of the writer's he has in his eye yet to consider how he fell into them leads us directly to the authority on which the question before us ought to be decided this inquiry I therefore now enter upon  IF as it is laid down above great improvements had been made in Legislation during the former part of the reign of Charles the Second yet as they were brought forward successively and not in a mass under a single statute like the Petition of Right in they must be found scattered up and down among facts of that event∣ful period which were more striking to the imagination of the reader and even that of the historian When the miscellaneous materials of history are so joined together he is not able by a retrospective glance upon the assem∣blage of all of them to obtain a distinct view of one class of events as for example the changes of the spirit or letter of Laws To give a precise idea of these interesting particulars proper epochs must be selected in the course of a History and at each term the state of the Laws should be accurately delineated then the varia∣tion from term to term should be truly and carefully assigned and it should be shewn by way of result whether they were in a gradual state of improve∣ment or the contrary These periodical reviews or balances Mr Hume has not drawn out but admit him to have attempted it it is certain he would have been much better qualified for the task if that acuteness and judgment in which he excelled had been principally employed in the study of the statute books and the whole theory practice and history of our Laws He then would have been intitled to entire credit with re∣gard to what he had said on the change of the legal Con∣stitution  at the accession of King William on the maxim  Cuilibet suâ in arte credendum  Now what Hume omitted and what he was not from a long and necessary course of study so well able to effect has been done by Judge Blackstone at the end of his Commentaries on the Laws of England After he had recently finished a full systematical account of the whole he gives a history of the variations the Law has under∣gone divided into periods as above described The reign of Charles the Second forms a period by itself and the fifth in order and from so complete a view of the subject he lays it down that  the Constitution of Eng∣land had arrived to its full vigour and the true balance between Liberty and Prerogative was happily established by Law in the reign of King Charles the Second  V p    wicked sanguinary and turbulent  as he had before admitted it to have been He adds in a note below that  the point of time at which he would chuse to fix this  theoretical  perfection in our public Law is in the year though those which followed it were times of great practical oppression  Ibid    And in the last para∣graph of his work he states that our Laws and Liberties were totally eclipsed at the Norman Conquest and  were not thoroughly and completely regained till after the Restoration of King Charles nor fully and explicitly acknowledged and defined till the aera of the happy Re∣volution  Ibid p    Those liberties when they were fully and completely regained were then as securely ours as law in the turbulent state of society which then ob∣tained could render them and the explicit acknowledge∣ment  of some preexisting laws and their principles can∣not be considered as even a change of them it cannot amount to newmodelling a Constitution or what Mr Hume as quoted above calls a new settlement of the whole Constitution nor is such a change to be found in the improvement of a definition The greatest alteration made in the Law was that the King should be of the Protestant religion Otherwise the Bill of Rights though contain∣ing matter of great consequence was absolutely decla∣ratory stating certain points either to be already the Law of the Land or contradictory thereto In a word the Constitution of England as existing in stood on the footing of Law in and if we admit with Blackstone that it had attained theoretical perfec∣tion at the first period I should hold it  a libel on the Revolution  to say after Mr Hume that a new settlement was then made of the whole or that any other Constitu∣tion was then established What then was the Revolu∣tion as it affected the Constitution A successful re∣sistance against an attempt to overthrow the system of Government established by the Laws And what is it now to act upon Revolution principles To resist all attempts whether popular aristocratical or regal to subvert such Government The Revolution was the conservation of the Constitution already established by Law which was arrived at such perfection that any attempts by violence at a supposed improvement of it would have been in the highest degree criminal  THE present general interest in the question how far the Revolution was a change of the preestablished form of Government and of the Laws has led me into a con∣siderable length perhaps more than necessary from my  direct object In what precedes however it will be found that the principles on which what the Author of the Letter has said on the Revolution which seems to have given offence may be justified at their full extent I come now to their application It is not of the na∣ture of a Constitution to be free from the attempts of external force but so early as the year that  of England had arrived to its full vigour and the true balance between liberty and prerogative  Bl v p    The people had sufficient power residing in  their own hands to assert and preserve that liberty if invaded  Ib p    as the event proved in The Constitution therefore wanted neither formation nor establishment the exertion of power already possessed was become indeed highly ne∣cessary it was well exerted and the Constitution was saved Hence the LetterWriter justly reprobates those who disguising other principles under the name of Re∣volutional "idolize a Revolution in the abstract  Let p l  " that is any change of governors or legal forms of Govern∣ment those who  have no love for the  Constitution  but for that which was  formed at the Revolution  previously to which it was perfectly formed and according to the opi∣nion of Blackstone established in full vigour and before James the Second ascended the throne and hence the Author very rightly laughts at the  disappointment and discomfiture of these idolizers of a Constitution sup∣posed to be established at the Revolution on disco∣vering at length that they have bestowed their ap∣plause and affection upon shreds and patches of old date  Let p    which they so ostentatiously affect to des∣prise  although the records of what they had imagined to be a new Constitution made in It is likewise by the same respectable and I suppose Constitutional au∣thority that of the Commentaries we are informed that public law had attained its  theoretical  perfection in though the years which immediately followed it were times of great  practical  oppression  Bl v p  This has been cited before for another purpose but I may say here that on such authority the LetterWriter might very well pronounce of the politicians described above  that if they had lived in the wicked reigns of Charles the Se∣cond and James the Second they would have enjoyed in  theory  though not in  practice  and theory of the two is more considered by modern reformers as good a Constitution as they have had since with the single exception of a Protestant King  Let p l    IN the beginning of the page from which the last cita∣tion is made he affirms that  the other points which were twelve in number were as I have said known to be the Law of the Land before and were now de∣clared and secured by express definition in Parliament  This was done by the Bill of Rights These observations on the effect of the transactions of that time on the Con∣stitution cannot be closed without a brief exposition of the nature of that Bill Its object according to the LetterWriter was  only that what had been the recent cause of alarm what was so deeply impressed on the minds of all and what might be thought from late experience to be of a nature that required it should be solemnly inculcated might be held up for admonition to future  ages  Let p l  In these two passages nothing more is to be found than the sentiments that Blackstone had expressed with a little more vivacity that  our Liberties and Laws extinguished by the Norman Conquest  were thoroughly and completely regained before the Revo∣lution  and  at that happy aera explicitly acknow∣ledged and defined  Bl v p    Both these writers agree that the object of the Bill of Rights was to reassert those parts of the Laws and Constitution which had been violated in act or of which doubts were entertained and another authority of great weight may be brought to show what is indeed obvious in itself that all change of the legal Constitution was sedulously avoided even such as might appear evident ameliorations and which recent experience seemed to call for  One thing says Dalrymple very remarkable in the Declaration of Rights is that it condemns not the suspending and dispensing powers but only those powers as exercised by King James    And in the last great article of all  that Parliaments should be frequently assembled  the wordsfrequent Parliamentsleft the intervals of their assembling and the duration of their sitting as undeterminate as ever  Dal Part i p    THE spirit with which this Declaration was penned may be gathered from what passed at the vote of Abdi∣cation when  the wiser part of the Whigs at the head of whom was Mr Sommers persuaded their Party to make their own sentiments of liberty bend to the na∣ture of the Constitution and to the principles of the Tories  some of them having pointed at laying  such restrictions upon the authority of either King or Regent as would have reduced the offices almost to empty titles  Dal Part I p    This sober system though transient was adhered to in drawing up the Declaration of Rights  Ibid p  if in any part of it they had aimed at even an ameliora∣tion of the legal Constitution we might expect to have seen it done with regard to the suspending power and the assembling of Parliaments But on so fair a ground they scrupulously abstained from it and confined themselves to the simple declaration of the letter of the existing Con∣stitution on those points in which it had been endan∣gered The Revolution consisted in the voluntary abdi∣cation of James his will being demonstrated by three overt acts specified in the Vote of the Convention and its proper definition is a Revolution by Abdication But as the whole definition is too long either for con∣versation or writing it were to be wished that in giving a shorter name to this event we had formed it upon the language of Parliament and called it the Abdication The name contains a moral lesson of sufficient strength to any future Prince instructing him that a certain period  gravi documento in posterum sancitum fuit ne quis unquam Populo injuriam opportunam reputaret  Livy  It likewise holds out no equivocal sense like the term Revolution which a pernicious demagogue can catch hold of to subvert that very Constitution which the transactions of saved from subversion intire and without change  The spirit of Administration is a point of great consequence in every Government but that always depends upon the temper of the governors and that of the people conjointly it admits no specific definition any more than the several gradations of light between total darkness and sunrise It can be marked only in general terms incapable of legal precision in their senses it there∣fore cannot be established by law The spirit of Administration in Government has been very much ameliorated since the Revolution but this could arise from no change of an actual Constitution it is totally to be attributed to the salutary lesson the Abdication con∣ve  ed and a change of manners and ideas    THE term  Revolution  itself being equally applicable to all changes of Government or Governors good or bad is generical There are many species of Revolutions and bad men avail themselves of the ambiguity of the term From the praises of the Revolution of the populace are easily induced to believe a Revol  tion of another species must be likewise good in the event they may find it the greatest of evils The botanists tell us that that excellent root the potatoe is of the genus  Sola∣num  yet if any person describing its wholesomeness and good qualities to one not acquainted with the plant should instruct him only in its generical character or marks which he afterwards discovering very clearly in the nightshade should eat it with confidence his life would pay for the error he was led into and into this error our political botanists appear to have led a neighbouring nation  THERE is a circumstance of some curiosity in the his∣tory of the Bill of Rights to which as it tends to justify the LetterWriter's account of the state of Parties at the Revolution which has been obj  cted to with much asperity I shall here give a place After the Con∣vention became a Parliament the Commons in which  the Whig Party intirely prevailed  From an anecdote extracted by Dalrymple from Clarendon's Diary it seems very probable that many of the more respectable Commoners of the Whig Party lost their elections to the Convention Parliament I mean those who acceded to the coalition with the Tories in James's time whom I presume to have been the most moderate men who did not run into such diametrical extremity of opposition to them These joined the Prince and were in his camp when James issued his writs for the calling of a Parliament It filled them with alarm for their seats so much so as to induce them to pro∣pose to William and strongly to insist upon a very strange measure and when he summoned the Convention many of them must have found they had begun their canvas too late The same I suppose to have been the disappointment of many of the Tories of moderate principles and of fidelity to their engagements At first things went on well under the direction of Mr Sommers but the latent dis∣tempers arising from the bad formation of the House soon broke out and suffer us little to regret its dissolution in about one year and less to wonder either that King William should attempt it or succeed without shaking his new throne  turned the Declara∣tion of Rights into a Bill which they sent up to the Peers in which House the Tories had a majority Upon the suggestion of the King Bishop Burnet proposed as an additional clause that the Princess Sophia of Hanover and her posterity should succeed to the Crown in case of the death of the daughters of James the Se∣cond without lineal heirs This Amendment was adopted by the Lords and the Bill of Rights with this addition tacked to it was flung out of the House of Commons and by the Whig Party  Dal Part II p  In the following Sessions they again declined to admit the succession of the House of Hanover as a part of the Bill  Ib p  but the obnoxious clause being struck out at last it was suffered to pass  Ib p    To render the King's revenue annual would absolutely destroy his independence and render him a cypher in the Constitution reducing it to a government of the two Houses or ultimately to that of an Elective National Assembly Yet this very party in the House of Com∣mons having postponed the settlement of the revenue till the th of December voted it then for one year only  Dal Part II p    WITH these events in his recollection any man at∣tached to this solemn Declaratory Act to the House of Hanover or to a mixed Monarchy may say if the au∣thors of these measures were active in producing the Revolution that although  that event was brought about by the energy good sense and firmness of some of the best and greatest men in the Nation it was of a nature unlike most good things to be helped on by the concurrence and approbation of some of the worst men that could be found  Let p l    But in the defence of these men and their measures I do not see that those Whigs  who mean no otherwise than well toward the antient Government and Laws of the Land  Ibid p l    are any further interested than the members of the Church of England in the vindication o  the Anabaptists at Mun∣ster in the last century because the latter called themselves Protestants But perhaps the time is not yet come when any Party will venture to claim the national confidence by a decisive censure of the evils that have been commit∣ted or attempted by those who have assumed and perhaps usurped their names and the successors of these men were too long permitted to range themselves among them  However the fermentation of the time has been of use to the dignity of the Whig Party a natural separation has taken place and this feculence has subsided They are completely separated from that subdivision formerly incorporated with them the school of the Eclectics who combined a profession of the political theory of Harry Vane with the political practice of Lord Shaftefbury and who had obtained to be of the number or in the words of the LetterWriter  had taken their stand among the Whigs  Let p l    before I shall conclude what I have to say about the Revolution by proving this point that after having cleared the Writer of the accusation of having treated that event as a farce I may not be in∣volved in it myself for having said that the change then effected in the Constitution itself was minute and that the object of the Bill of Rights was to preserve the Constitu∣tion in its then existing form It may also teach those who venerate our legal liberties and even the independence of the popular Estate of the Legislature on the power of the Crown so to continue to distinguish themselves from this faction that they may never again have the appearance of belonging to them to aid them in their designs to overwhelm both in one common ruin I shall therefore here shew the necessity of the Revolu∣tion in one point of view in which our more ele∣gant and popular historians have not distinctly placed it  AFTER the seizing of the charter of the City of Lon∣don in the reign of Charles the Second many of the richer Corporations purchased new ones There appears to have been no disposition to grant them  gratis  even  upon voluntary surrender  Coke's Detection e p  The terms of these new charters were such as to leave the nomination of the re∣presentatives of those Corporations almost entirely in the power of the Crown After this wide breach in the Constitution the servility of James's first and last Par∣liament was not sufficient to answer all his purposes The charters of the most numerous class of the Corpo∣rations that is of the poorer boroughs had not been yet called in To induce them to a general surrender he determined to grant new ones without fees  Ib p  Under these new charters the Crown had ultimately the power of nominating to all offices but to add to this influence in elections all which fell little short of absolute nomi∣nation James instituted a set of officers called Regu∣lators to examine the qualifications of electors and ex∣clude all such as adhered to the Test and penal statutes  Hume p  The House of Commons then consisted of members of which by this arrangement would have been effectually nominated by the Crown  Coke's Detection p  Nor did he want agents to assist him in the completion of his plan to ren∣der his power predominant in all the Corporations a plan which his brother had left imperfect  he  might dread or  he  might be averse to the experiment I copy the words of Coke a cotemporary writer a zealot for the principles of Whiggism and therefore an unexcep∣tionable evidence when censuring the conduct of that Party  The  Whigs  were but too forward to congra∣tulate the King on his designs and in humouring him  in giving him up their charters  as the Tories in King Charles's reign in their abhorrences of the  King's calling a Parliament and as forward then as the Whigs now in surrendering their charters  Coke's Detection p The passage is given as it stands without any alteration of its construction Coke is frequently quo∣ted by Hume    It must be admitted here that this charge upon the Whigs is too general There then existed a numerous body among them who were to use the language of the times "Tories in the Church and Whigs in the State  Dal Mem Part II p  " These must have been in the most diametrical opposition to the plans of James The section of the Whig Party here meant must be such of the bigoted sectaries who mingled with them and we may add to these all who could by the emoluments of office or the love of power or the desire of trampling upon their formidable rivals be blinded to a danger apparently both distant and contingent But unfortunately that spirit was then ex∣tremely prevalent and the distribution of rewards by James points out that the agents of this service are here rightly assigned The offices of all the Corporations whose charters were surrendered had before this been filled with those who had opposed the Exclusion Bill  these were now turned out with disgrace and those who appeared most violently against him were put into the magistracy  Burnet's Hist mo p    the Corporation of London was filled up with Dissenters and afterwards that of every other town  Hume v p    THUS the King had completed or nearly completed the seizing into his own hands the effective nomination  of Members of the House of Commons and by reducing it to a total dependence upon himself annihi∣lated the Third Estate by annihilating its use and with an independent income of £ a year which he managed with a rigid oeconomy he dictated his arbi∣trary will to the Nation at the head of a regular army of men Such were the formidable machines which he had prepared to batter down the bulwarks of the Con∣stitution There were likewise other violations of Law and usurped powers which alone would have ren∣dered the measures pursued against him necessary He had it is true begun to retract but the wind shifted it blew the Dutch fleet back and he reretracted and the Revolution consisted almost solely in the expulsion of such a Sovereign  I might have proceeded farther and said that the conferring of the Crown and the intire administration upon William pre∣served the Kingly power in the Constitution The attempts to an∣nihilate it at the beginning of his reign have been shown all his policy his cool determination and vigour were requisite to preserve it If a Regency had been set up or the sceptre had been placed in the hands of Mary it could not have been maintained By his arrival William preserved one integral part of the Constitution from virtual annihilation the Popular Estate In little more than a year he was called to a new task the Constitution was again threatened with destruction by measures which would have ended in the abolition of Royalty and he preserved it by an act of the greatest political courage and vigour the dissolution of the Parlia∣ment which had placed him on the Throne from becoming a turbulent Democracy  I cannot help making one observation to which I should be in∣c  ned to give a place in the natural history of Parties that the practical opinions of better men in each differ very much from  what their Agitators lay down as principles and their consequences for all Parties have their Agitators and sometimes even men of some figure are found in this forlorn hope Following the order of time I shall take from the Tories the first example of this truth When real danger threatened the popular part of the Constitution  from them it is certain the most pressing calls to the Prince of Orange came  Dal Part I p    Sir Edward Seymour who was the leader of that Party was the first who rearing the standard of Liberty joined the Prince with a considerable force bringing with him the Gentlemen of Dorsetshire and Somersetshire he planned the fa∣mous Association  Whitworth's Davenant Vol IV p Dal V I Part I p Burnet p    The generous support the Tories then gave to legal liberty we now see the whole body of Whigs with few exceptions worth re∣garding pay to legal Kingly power  With a Constitutional nobility of spirit they have thronged around the standard of legal mixed Mo∣narchy  and the best men of either Party if there be any specula∣tive Tories now might with a little change of two lines of Cowley's celebrated Poem upon Crashaw say of their opponents so acting  Their saith perhaps in some nice tenets might  Be wrong their lives I'M SURE were in the right  Little doubt I suppose can be made but the Agitators and Bigots of the Tory Party for I suppose they had not the "sturdy morality" to deny leave to the Absolute Monarchymen to call themselves by their name were not wanting on this occasion to call these gene∣rous defenders of the Constitution apostates and their declarations against the excesses of their unconstitutional fanaticism desertion of  principle holding all principles that are barely general to be uni∣versally true for people of this sort have been alwaysvery chari∣table to a parcel of poor words whose lot it has been to be held in discredit  o  e  ing their unfortunate lot very much by applying them to subjects to which nothing bad can attach so taking off most of the odium in which they have been formerly held But I cannot equally praise the goodnature of  persons at this day in the exercise of the absolute power they have over the English lan∣guage with respect to the poorword "Patriot" which though it may retain its honours in the graver style yet by their too frequent application of it they have made it in common conversation and familiar writing synonymous to "Political Tartusse" and my love of English literature is such that I beseech nay even with Dr Bentley "vehemently exhort" the said Legislators in Language that they will send to the Gentleman who is as I hear now com∣piling a Dictionary of the English Language at Oxford a list of all such words as they purpose to employ in the next five years either in panegyric or reprehension that it may not be in part obsolete before it comes out together with the day on which they intend first so to use the same as for example July the th whereby he may warn the purchasers of his work that until July the th the word is to be understood in its present esta∣blished sense but that at o'clock on that day and ever after it is to be used in burlesque only or in that figure to which the Greek  ricians have given the name of Irony    EVERY Revolution must be defended on the necessity of the individual case and no arguments drawn from this example can be brought to justify a Revolution in any  case not of the same kind much less Revolutions in general As for instance It is a common belief that the first Revolution in Poland was a good one yet not one particular argument in favour of that of will apply to the latter nor can any consequences be drawn from a Revolution of persons or governors whereby the Laws and Constitution were intended to be preserved to prove the utility of a Revolution whose end is to effect a change in them let the nature of that change be what it will and he seems to me to be ignorant of the merits  of the Revolution or to traduce it who commends it for being what it was not It would be ignorance in an eulogium of Newton to praise him as a sublime poet or Locke for his skill in naval tactics and if I were to celebrate the personal courage of Augustus or the con∣jugal fidelity of Henry the Fourth I should be supposed to be advancing some sly invectives against them Per∣haps not to find in one Revolution sufficient grounds for another may be to make it of no consequence  to make a farce of it  for nothing with some persons can be of consequence in the first which is not ground for a second but to others it may still seem that the right of resistance is one of the  jura extremae necessitatis  and therefore it may be of some danger to be always inculcating it into the minds of the popu∣lace We know that by the same laws of extreme ne∣cessity a man may take a loaf of bread or a few pounds of meat from his neighbour to save himself from perish∣ing but if in all the churches and chapels of his Majes∣ty's dominions this were to be perpetually preached and enforced in every pulpit upon the great principle of selfpreservation the enlightened populace would always con∣ceive themselves to be in extreme necessity and hold themselves in readiness to exercise this right  FROM what has been said above on the Constitution and the different senses given to that term it appears the LetterWriter is a friend to the Laws and Liberties of his country and equally so in the unreserved approba∣tion which in the First Part he has been shown to have given to the national moderation dignity and greatness manifested in the Revolution in and in censuring the equivocal use of the term to effect a second different  in its nature and consequences The equivocal use of the word Constitution is of equal danger as it is per∣verted to the same purposes and he treats it in the same manner both as to its genuine and adulterated sense which at the proper places I shall show as I go on  ONE might think the word Constitution  I find the term Constitution in its true sense to have been in common use in "Why do we trouble ourselves" says Sir F Seymour in the debates on the Petition of Right  with dis∣putes about a Constitution and franchises  The term I suppose to have grown into disuse and to have been revived in the days of North who mentions it as a new term  commonly brought for∣ward with a Republican face  Let p l  rather more untractable and less liable to perversion than the term Revolution but by a dextrous treatment it has been moulded down to serve the same purposes It will be of use therefore to commence these observations with a definition of the term Constitution in its genuine and original sense Our Laws are divisible into two classes Those which relate to the subject as such and those which relate to the Governors as such or in the exercise of the functions of Government The whole mass of the latter form the Constitution of Government the parts of which are found scattered up and down in the Statute and Common Law and the Constitution is in this sense what is so already constituted and nothing else But the present Constitution might have been called by the same name when it was future and the same liberty is now taken Another Constitution which some persons are desirous of establishing is called the Constitution and neglecting to distinguish which they  mean they attribute to the word used in the second sense that which is true of the firstthe obligation to venerate and support it c  IT is of a Constitution differing from that which is de∣fined by Law that the LetterWriter speaks thus  The Government we know and the Laws we know but the Constitution we know not  Let p l    This strong dis∣junction shows him to have meant a system of Govern∣ment different from what the Laws have here established and this admits of plain proof The preceding page is taken up in shewing that it has become a doctrine in some other countries That nothing is intitled to be called a Constitution but a system springing out of an act declaratory of abstract principles as of the Rights of Man  Substance of p of the Letter  whence they tell us that we have  no Consti∣tution  To this he subjoins that we  may with∣out yielding anything take these Constitutionmakers at their word and at once allow that we have no Con∣stitution in the sense in which  they  understand it  And continuing to employ the word in the same sense six lines after follows the passage quoted  The Govern∣ment we knowand the Laws we know  but the Constitution we know not  There is no doubt that certain general principles may be inferred from the Laws relating to our Governors as such but these in∣ductions are not a part of the body of the Law The object of Civil Law is human acts it ordains what is right or expedient in act and forbids the contrary these are its limits and it extends no further There∣fore  such abstract principles are not the objects or subjectmatter of Law Nor ought a system of such opinions to be declared by a particular law to form a foundation for all the rest And those who would do this either in the whole or in part are the Constitutionmakers against whom he in many places declares Let us at least extract wisdom from what must long be a source of grief even to us but when the curtain draws up and we see a Constitution brought forward upon the stage dressed with this lofty  thuraus  to give it strut and dig∣nity depend upon it the piece that is going to be per∣formed is a tragedy  LET us now examine what the LetterWriter has said on the existing Constitution by Law established In the same paragraph from whence the last passage is cited he gives his opinion that  the English Government is real and substantial we see and feel it we can take its height and its depth we know its movements be∣cause they are regulated by established and known Laws This is the only Constitution ever supposed or named by men of sober minds and sound under∣standing that isthe Constitution of our Government or the Constitution established by Law  Let p l    I have no occasion to show that he holds out this idea of the Con∣stitution as a preservative against Republican principles or at least those which tend to incline many greatly to increase the weight in the popular scale and thus en∣deavours to represent them as visionary and fantastic theories But this fact which he lays down may be em∣ployed to another purpose it may be applied with  equal success against the reveries of unlimited Monarchy∣men and we find in effect he had before expressly thus applied it "I always thought" says he  that Eng∣lishmen required plain and defined sentences for the Charter of their Rights and Liberties that they claimed to have known written and express Laws to govern them  That  the divine indefeasible rights of Kings  with  other fancies  of former times were exploded prin∣cipally because they were positions that had no warrant from the known express Laws of the Land but rested on general reasoning from topics not known to the usage and Laws of the Country  Let p l  IT is in the Common Law and Statutes alone that we are to search for the rules which regulate the actions of our Governors  as such  or for the Constitution Protestants search for the principles of their religion only in the letter of the Revelation and Englishmen for the principles of the Constitution in the letter of the Law It is not accessible in the original indeed to every one to whom some knowledge of those principles is necessary Expositors and Commentators are of high utility but their authority is to be estimated exclusively by the care with which they follow the letter of these originals and explain with equal accuracy fullness and force what regards the constituent powers of the Constitution The real Constitution and the history of its variations are finely delineated in Blackstone's Commentaries and although I would not subscribe to everything he lays down where he comes to treat certain parts of the subject philo∣sophically yet a diligent study of this work I esteem as  the best preservative against the flux and reflux of popu∣lar errors which at different past periods have made the general idea of the Constitution shift like a loose sand∣bank  THERE are other schools in which this knowledge is sometimes sought Debates in Parliament will have their use in giving perfection and ornament to it But here considerable caution is required they are to be read as the arguments of Advocates in a court giving the most specious dress to the side on which they are re∣tained not as the judgment of the Bench When the State is divided into Parties either of them will tell you this is true of their opponents But there is one caution here particularly necessary when we are examining the argu∣ments of the Party who  proposed  any law we ought to inspect very closely whether the principles they lay down do not extend farther than the actual law itself for to the principle in that extent that law has given a tacit negative it is therefore unconstitutional And I believe an observance of this caution would have suppressed in embryo many very brilliant remarks on the nature of the Constitution  THE Codes which contain our civil and religious duties are liable to the same abuses of misinterpretation the Constitution has its Methodist Preachers There were  y enthusiasts formerly who could see nothing in the Laws but what made for the Royal power There were  Lawyers of this class formerly and there is a nume∣rous body of ignorant fanatic Preachers now belonging to it who resolutely overlook all these texts and can see nothing but what exalts the popular branch of the  Government over the other two There is likewise an∣other set of professors of Constitutional Science formed upon the model of the Socinians who now usurp the name of Rational Divines These men borrow a good deal from the school of the Metaphysical Politicians whom I shall presently notice These expositors of the Law and Constitution thus furnished the plan of their relations the Divines The professional man of this sect when he finds anything in his book which will not square with them cuts the knot by affirming it is not Law because Law being the perfection of reason must concur with his reason And sometimes he goes an∣other way to work imposing his own sense upon the words of Law for which purpose he has a private code of verbal criticisms which the grammarians who have seen it declare to be so profound as to surpass their com∣prehension At some seasons the whole weight of popu∣lar favour will be so flung into one scale as almost to overset the balance of the Constitution and at other times it shall be cast into the other The error of the Multitude is always called by them a Constitutional Truth At such times he will obtain the reputation of a Consti∣tutional Lawyer who flings his whole weight into the overloaded scale  LAST but not for their inferiority in rank to either of the preceding classes we may place the Metaphysical Politicians And these are divided into two sects one setting out from the doctrine of the good effects of union of power concenter it absolutely the other now from the abuse of it disperse it to the utmost by equalising every man's share These walk in the  "via regia"  the "high  priori  road" of the science of politics and make  a short cut to all their conclusions by the use of cer∣tain things called Abstract Principles and of these they prepare the bread of life for the Constitution Now an abstract principle is a thing very like a Cas∣sava root if you grate it and press the virulent juices out of it it makes a very nourishing food but if you use it without that preparation it is a poison These philosophers formerly have gone very slightly through this course of manipulation but now they omit it en∣tirely and the Abbé Sieyes has condemned it as an  at∣taint upon principle  BUT I pass from these men and the confusion they have introduced into our notions of the Constitution to describe one dangerous but sp  cious source of error in arguing on it When we consider the power of any one of its constituent parts separately and the reasons urged for it we may sometimes  by analogy that more should be added to it and  y will at first view conclude that this is an argument for so doing But it will be  sily shewn that this is not conclusive for by adding  o any one power we destroy the preestablished balance and proportion of the three and if the Constitu∣tion were good before if the effect of the change be small it is almost a movement without a motive if great it is an evil it generates a new Constitution diffe∣rent from that found before by experience to be good The identity of mixed Constitutions depends upon the same constituent parts being combined in the same man∣ner and in the same proportion like that of a medical composit on for if you vary the proportion of the in∣gredients of the latter though you preserve the num∣ber its effect may greatly vary in one proportion  the compound may restore a man to health in a dange∣rous illness in another put an end to his existence  IT follows from this that when any man or set of men are charged with wishing to make a great change in the existing Constitution if they barely declare them∣selves friends to a Government by King Lords and Commons they do not thereby disclaim that charge For this purpose they must make an addition to this de∣claration and say that each ought to possess the same powers they now hold For a Party who may wish to bring the Government of Great Britain very near to a Democracy to an Aristocracy or to pure Despotism with two almost noneffective pageants of power to sup∣port the names of its other two constituent parts may with equal truth make the same declaration Of the equivocation I am describing it is to be feared there are too many instances I illustrate this matter farther by examples taken from our own history  HENRY the Eighth trampled upon the Lords and Commons in the reign of Henry the Sixth during some time before the civil wars the Nobility tyrannized over the King and the people and before Charles the First quitted the metropolis the Commons had effec∣tively reduced the Peers and the King to cyphers and if any of these three usurpations had been confirmed by the forms of Law it would have been a Govern∣ment by King Lords and Commons but it could not take place now without a subversion of the existing Constitution  THE defence of the Constitution as it is now fixed by Law and Custom is and ought to be the common center of union both to those who consider it as arrived at that degree of practical perfection that no farther expe∣riments should be tried upon it and those who allow∣ing much that is excellent in it full retain an idea that it might be worth the while to attempt some farther mode∣rate ameliorations of it I freely declare in favour of the former and even on speculative principles but on the points in which these allies differ I urge nothing In the little I have to  I hope to be in concurrence with the sentiments of the latter While the present fermen∣tation in the minds of the populace is kept up by every class of se  tious agit  rs to attempt any change in the existing proportion of the  ree powers does not seem mo  e safe than the c  ging of the position of an army wh  n the enemy  approached close up to it and is about instantly to commence  attack which almost inevita∣bly must terminate in a total rout If you should carry your point now your victory the agitators will repre∣sent as theirs and they will meet with ready belief They and their Party will grow in courage in number in force and in consequence most probably too high for you and your former opponents if united to make a stand against them and the Constitution you will have to live under will at least be much more remote from what you have fixed upon in your minds as a standard than the present  WITH two or three miscellaneous observations I shall close a Tract that has grown to a much greater length than I expected I must remark on the LetterWriter that Calvin did not concur with Beza on the  subject of Church Government by Bishops  It will be seen that this does not invalidate his general state∣ment  There is no Divine of the Church of England now who would speak the language of the former I have not his works but I find in the Preface to the Clergyman's  Vade Mecum  that in his Answer to the artful and elegant work of Cardinal Sadolet against the first Reformers he cer∣tainly does  anathematize all those who do not revere and pay the most profound obedience to that hierar∣chy in which Bishops retain their eminence but so as to submit to Christ Jesus and depend on him as their Head  Second Edit Pref p    Now I have never heard even of Archbishop Laud that he fulminated an anathema against all who did not "most profoundly revere" the Episcopal Church Government in England But of Beza the Marquis D'Argens informs us that at the conferences at Poissi by his declaration against the Episcopal Government  he lost the finest opportunity possible of introducing a thorough reformation in the Gallican Church  Jewish Letters Let Translation    If Bayle had known this par∣ticular he would not have been perplexed to as∣sign the reason why those conferences were so unex∣pectedly broken off We also find in the History of Geneva that the citizens founded a College for the education of foreigners resorting thither and the cir∣cumstance immediately following it is that the Duke of Savoy and Charles the Ninth of France remonstrated strongly with the Republic that the students on their return excited their subjects to disobedience and sedi∣tion  Modern Universal H  v p paragraph abridged  The name of Hugonot according to De Thou was not originally that of a sect but of a political Party and borrowed from Geneva which was divided into two clas∣ses the Eignots or confederates by oath and the Mama∣lues or Egyptian sl  ves  Ibid p    which seem very well to answer the modern terms of Party in France What a leaven of Republicanism they there got and diffused in their na∣tive conntries debasing the superior purity of their doc∣trines we see in an unmived and unequivocal light in one part of the history of that kingdom The Edict of Nantz had been passed seven years Henry the Fourth their patron was still on the throne his administration with respect to them was such that they wished him immortal It is the Protestant Duke of Sully that is their accuser If we may believe that great man  a scheme had been formed for establishing a kind of a Common∣wealth or at least a body apart from the rest of the kingdom by an association among the Protestants  Ibid v  p      He names the men who formed it The historian con∣tinues  The body of the Protestants did not see the thing in this light and when they did they disap∣proved it  Sully must have been so willing to be satisfied that I cannot suppose he was not We all stop short by a kind of instinct in the investigation of facts the result of which will give us pain His declaration likewise by no means exculpates those who guided their councils It was perhaps impolitic when the storm was weathered to draw aside the veil attempted to be drawn over the conspiracy The Hugonots had been formed  into something like an  imperium in imperio  for years and it is not likely that the disciples of Geneva should form a Republic without knowing it Though I admit if a man were to set up the frame of a house upon my ground and upon my threatening a prosecution he were to consent to remove it and were to tell me that when he cut out his timbers into proper scantlings adapted them to one another framed and pinned them together he did not know it was a house which he had been fram∣ing and that "he looked upon it in another light" the point seems to me so exceedingly difficult of proof that I should not contest it though I knew he had been edu∣cated in a carpenter's shop  IT remains to consider what the LetterWriter has said on the late Trials of certain persons for Treason The material part of it is as follows  They were indeed  acquitted by a Jury  but they have been since found  guilty by their Country on the evidence  of the pro∣ceedings at the Trial  Let p l    This is first brought as a proof that he does not treat Juries with due reverence I subscribe without hesitation to their absolute necessity as I do to our mode of making Laws but as I do not sup∣pose myself treating the Legislature of the kingdom with contempt when I find fault with a law enacted by it which must have been so often debated and have received three such important sanctions every Englishman has sure∣ly the full right to treat the verdict of a Jury decided at once with the same freedom without an impu∣tation of want of reverence for that excellent institu∣tion The voice of the Law itself is on this side To  guard our liberties and in tenderness to persons arraign∣ed no second trial takes place in criminal cases at the suit of the Crown but it is not to be supposed that Juries are more infallible when sitting on such causes than in civil cases in which the Law itself supposes that they may give a verdict contrary to evidence by allowing a new trial in such cases  THE Jury mentioned before were acknowledged by the Judge to have displayed "the most unwearied attention "and the most diligent investigation" They also brought in their verdict after much private deliberation But what does this amount to That they went through all the forms of business with the strictest attention to decorum The point where he stopped directs the at∣tention decidedly to what he was silent upon I think to remember having observed this when I first saw the words It is a "silence that speaks" and I think on the side of the LetterWriter Do not Judges frequently express their satisfaction at a verdict and did this Judge appear to have been backward in giving approbation where he could do it with propriety These construc∣tions of silence when certain decorums impose it are at least as old as Menander whom I quote in the margin and who observes "they speak  many things  S Poetae Men p  " And if the authority of a Poet will not do we may bring that of an Historian that when by the state of political affairs great men are induced to show some things and keep others back the public attention is strongly called to the latter Was not the memory of Brutus and Cassius im∣pressed upon every Roman's mind most strongly be∣cause  the discretion of one of their descendants con∣cealed their statues on a wellknown occasion  LET the question now be considered in another point of light We are to observe that the word Evidence bears in common conversation two senses according to the species thereof considered historical or judicial evidence The evidence may be enough to make any man believe the existence of a plot or come up to the point here called historical but it may fall short of that degree of strength the Law requires to take away the life of an in∣dividual or judicial evidence And where the evidence is only of the first magnitude or as it may do where it much exceeds the weight required by the first but still falls short of the standard of the second the Public MUST condemn and the Jury MUST acquit each with the same matter before them The national transactions with foreign Nations in peace and war are solely guided by the first species of evidence Senates proceed in their de∣clarative decisions on the first species of evidence when they think the State in danger to give the watchword to the People Courts of Justice on the second If nothing but judicial evidence were historical evidence history must be a blank or at least half the instructive lessons it holds out to mankind must be blotted out and upon that evidence men must speak or be reduced to mutes  JURIES are adjuncts to the Royal Executive Power and the LetterWriter is charged with having said that they may be "lopped off" without detriment to the State But in effect he nowhere supposes the axe ap∣plied  to this subsidiary and occasional power at all and when in other cases he supposes it to be applied he represents the monarchical trunk as being in conse∣quence "shorn of its honours" and if he holds the latter may be done without detriment to the State he is a Republican if both conjointly an Anarchist But I have never heard that the supposed Author of the Let∣ter holds any such political heresies which I am sure are not to be found there It is true however that when the kingly power was in this country  shorn of its honours  Juries in cases then called cases of High Treason were "lopped off" We are expressly told that Cromwell and the Parliament set them aside and erected "High Courts of Justice  Hume v p  " And to supersede them in like manner very soon after they were introduced the French Republicans copied this precedent in their Revolutionary Tribunals and if the same Republican usurpation should again take place in this country Juries may be once more  lopped off  THERE is another charge of a similar formation brought against what the Writer has said on the late Verdicts A great Orator has been made in the public papers to declare that it is asserted in the Letter that  the verdict of Juries is not a final decision in trials at Bar  This I have not seen there no more did he if by Bar he means the legal Bar But there is another and an awful Bar at which such verdicts have been often set aside as contrary to evidence that of impartial posterity  that of history that even of the men who live at the time when they are given after the  erment attending such a cause has subsided for even this last must be granted unless we suppose truth to be a volatile ingre∣dient like camphor which being mixed in that com∣pound called a verdict it shall thus retain as to sense the full odour thereof for a given time or number of years smell faintly for a second term and be quite flat always afterwards  YET if we grant this as highly probable to those who contend for this philosophical hypothesis they must according to their own principles at the same time admit it to be possible that it may be some∣times infused therein in a liquid form like aether and in cases where the ingredient is only so blended in the compound a man shall appear as the innocent victim of State persecution tonight and be universally believed an acquitted felon tomorrow for evaporate this aether will You may as easily fix "Hermes" which it is known cannot be done without the powder of precipita∣tion I have said it before and I repeat it again Juries are of the most absolute necessity to guard subjects against the oppression of governors but it does not follow that any dozen of reputable shopkeepers or farmers or mer∣chants or esquires in his Majesty's dominions are jointly vested with the sublime gift of infallibility The sublimest monuments of human wisdom and virtue are dishonoured by being praised for what they are not When we find them dressed out in such fantastical at∣tributives we suspect perhaps the design of such need∣less extravagance but we directly strip off the frippery  And I believe any man of taste would do the same if a French taylor and a French perruquier had exhausted all the wonders of their art upon the Farnesian Her∣cules  To return to the doctrine I am considering which is that the verdict which is decisive in a trial should decide every man's opinion Those who hold this doctrine are prepared I suppose to defend the legality of the decision on Algernon Sidney and all the ver∣dicts in the war of legal murders carried on by both the factions in the latter end of the reign of Charles the Second To me it appears that during all the time in the last century in which the Republican Party appeared visibly in existence and in action until it dwindled into obscurity the political Trials by Jury form no ornament to the page of our history a brilliant exception or two may however be alledged  FOR these reasons I think the LetterWriter guilt∣less  in toto  of all the charges I have seen brought against him If the Public attributes the work to the true Author it is every man's duty who thinks as I do of his past merits and the general importance of his political character and who has opportunities to take up his defence  THIS Tract was sent to the press without the Writer's being able to read the whole together He had the choice of abiding the censures of all inaccu∣racies so caused or to have delayed the publication  too long and he has chosen the former because on all such occasions that little sacrifice ought to be made It ought also to be announced because in such a circumstance a Writer is intitled to certain allowances  THE END  Lately published
