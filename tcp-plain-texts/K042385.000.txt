of a Letter to my Lord  Occasion'd by a Letter to the Publisher of the present Edition of the  Dunciad Variorum    SIR  THE Author of the  Dunciad  has now oblig'd himself and is perfectly happy in beholding his illustrious Brat the just Semblance of his sweet temper'd Parent make his Appearance He had long promis'd or rather threaten'd the Publick with this Edition but Nobody would believe that any Creature could be hardy or vain or wicked enough to undertake to utter a virulent Lampoon with the Names of many worthy Persons at full Length but it seems the Raneour of his Mind has got the better of his Fears and the Itch of Scribling is much superior to the Dread of Chastisement  Well then having like  Caesar  written his own Commentaries and given himself various Readings upon himself having guarded himself on all Sides and surrounded his Text with  Prolegomena    Testimonia    Arguments    Indexes    Appendix    c  and adorn'd himself with all the Pomp and Trappings that usually attend the Dignity of an establish'd Writer of Antiquity Behold him strutting into the World and expecting to receive the Reverence due to his Quality  Optat Ephippia Mus    and however awkardly they become him he rejoices in them Behold him now proclaiming himself a Classick behold a Personage whom he stiles  William Cleland  walking gravely before our Poetical Dictator bare Headed with the Fasces on his Shoulder and a little behind him an ugly Northern Thing formerly his Colleague in Scandal and Criticism an odd Mixture of  Doctor    Poet    Buffoon    Punster    Politician    Antiquary  and  Cook  methinks I see them now marching in solemn Parade round the new created Classick's Garden at  Twickenham  I hear them repeating the  Dunciad  and the neighbouring Shores resound his Verses  Yet has not the Author of the  Dunciad  's Vanity outrun his Judgment so many Lengths to persuade him to set his own Name to this modest Performance therefore has he borrow'd and very properly the Name of  Martinus Scriblerus  and not content with this or apprehensive this was not a sufficient Protection for him he has publish'd a Letter to his Publisher and sign'd it  William Cleland  I have many Reasons which induce me to believe that this Friend of  Scriblerus  's whom he calls  William Cleland  is a counterfeit Friend only and the Words stand like  Richard Roe  and  John Doe  for Form Sake only in a Recovery and to give the Modest Author of the  Dunciad  an Opportunity of saying something pretty in his own Favour Mr  Congreve  in his  Way of the World  shews us a Coxcomb who used to enquire for himself at a Chocolatehouse and not finding himself there would leave Letters for himself But our little merry Author goes farther he prints Letters to himself writes Libels threatens forgives punishes and is really the  Drawcansir  of the Age  In the Publisher's Preface for  our Classick  gives us a Publisher's Preface as well as a Preface to the Publisher he takes upon him to answer for Posterity and very modestly assures us that this insipid Poem will be read by Posterity These are his Words  In this Monument they must expect to survive    And here survive they shall  Oh dreadful  as long as the  English  Tongue shall remain such as it was in the Reigns of Queen  Anne  and King  George If this Pigmy Animal's Wit could come up to his Malice what Work would he make with those who should be so unhappy to fall under his Displeasure But as it is if this Monument as he calls it should last let the present Age inform him and hereby it does inform him that it will stand only as a Monument of his Infamy and those that come after us will and must believe the Persons who stood the Marks of his petulant Malice to be Worthy and Good Men and the Enemies of the Author of the  Dunciad  will be always look'd upon as the Friends of Virtue they will see a little invidious narrow  Mind in every Line he has written they will blush at his indecent Idaeas and be shock'd at his Scurrility Therefore I applaud your Design Sir of printing your Letter in Quarto exactly on the same Size with that of the  Dunciad Variorum  let it be bound up with it let them cling together through every Age there the Author of the  Dunciad shall survive and survive he shall As long as the  English  Tongue shall remain such as it was in the Reigns of Queen  Anne  and King  George If this should be the Case What Courage what Allies what Stature must future Ages conceive this Giant Warriour to be aided with They will imagine him at least to be Seven Foot high beyond the Growth of his Cotemporaries both in Stature and Understanding Will they not be surprized when I assure them and I do hereby assure them for I Sir put in my Claim to Immortality too by being annexed to you that this same Gyant was but about four Foot and an Half high of a Structure a little irregular and his Genius Low and indecent as his Form  But I lose my Purpose which was to shew the Improbability that any Man should be so weak or unadvis'd or hungry after any Sort of Fame to so mean a Degree to place or suffer his Name to be placed before a leud and infamous Libel therefore I say This same Author has written a Letter to himself in the Name of one  William Cleland  and made him to commend and applaud the Author for what every one knows he is liable by the Laws of the Land to be punish'd when he shall be discovered and for this Cause at the same Time that he has plac'd every Gentleman's Name whom he has abused at full Length he has not dared to subscribe his own  It is usual for the Merry Andrew after he has play'd over his arch Tricks for some Time to put on a grave Face to rectify his Muscles and to harangue his Audience in a more sober Wise to prepare them to receive the Doctor with Respect and this is always done in a prefatory Way before the Doctor produces his Medals or his Pacquets or proceeds to poison himself or the Company Our Doctor of the  Dunciad  has thought it proper it seems that somebody should for Form sake take upon him this Character and if he has not made his supposed Friend to rise to the Dignity of his  Zany  he may at least be allowed to be the Vinegar of the Ring and be qualified to whip the People into a Circle before the Sports begin As the Character of this  W C  thus drawn by the Libeller is of a very uncommon Kind I will give it you in some Observations upon this merry Letter of the Author of the  Dunciad  in the Name of this  W C  to the Publisher  of the  Dunciad  that is to Nobody it having been never publickly sold when he wrote his Letter So that here is one  W C  whom Nobody ever heard of writing to a certain Publisher whom Nobody knew  This same Author says in the Name of  W C  that it was a Mark of his Humanity to stay so long before he executed his Vengeance upon those who had offended him Now as Nobody knows better than he the Strength and Bitterness of his own Gall Nobody can assure us so well as he how long Malice will keep alive fifteen or twenty Years at least it seems but now as this Humanity of his as he is pleas'd to call it would be a very dangerous Plea at the  Old Baily  in an Indictment for the destroying a Man's Person I think it should weigh as little with the Candid in justifying the Destruction of a Man's Reputation  But he makes his  William Cleland  a Party to his Crime likewise and declares he assisted in composing the Libel He makes him affirm he was obliged to it in Humanity for says he very gravely  It was an Orphan  an  Orphan  Libel Libels are all Orphans dear  William Cleland  a Sort of Children whom their Fathers never care to own and though your Humanity may be very great I think in this Case your Prudence will hardly weight against it there are very good Reasons why this same Author does not own his Child and if you knew or consider'd them sure you would not thrust your Ears into the Dispute but I forget that this  W C  is only an  Ens Rationis  a Man of Straw set up by the candid Author of the  Dunciad  to combat for him  Immediately after this our Libeller forgot what he just before affirm'd and makes this very  W C  to say He has found out the Father of the Bastard he makes him most impudently to declare Mr  Pope  to be the Author If he means as I hope he does not the Poet of that Name who has been so much oblig'd by the Publick who is or ought to be by his Education a Gentleman whom Books ought to have taught Humanity and polite Conversation and Letters Decency and good Manners what does this infamous Author deserve for making his  W C  abuse him in this Manner But the Reasons he gives why he conceives Mr  Pope  to be the Author are equally scurrilous and ridiculous  Every one was curious  says he  to read what could be said to prove Mr  Pope  a Dunce and was ready to pay something for such a Discovery  How came he to imagine every one  curious to find this Gentleman a Dunce if he knows him to be  the Author of the  Dunciad  every Man of common Sense may easily judge what he is but as the Person who has written that low and infamous Satyr has not yet dared to set his own Name before it I think it did not become this same  W C  whoever he is to do it for him If  W C  was a real and not a feign'd Person I do not doubt but Mr  Pope  would do himself Justice for this Abuse and recur to the Laws for Satisfaction upon him  But this Author of the  Dunciad  whoever he is must be a pleasant Fellow for he goes on and makes his Man of Straw  W C  declare that when he saw Mr  Pope  attack'd or written against or answer'd by those who were abused for he will have him to be his Author still that he thought it was become a common Cause  the Danger was common to all and his Concern ought to be so too  and he causes him very seriously to deliver it as his Opinion That those who  attack'd Mr  Pope  must be Traitors to Church and State and Women  strange Stuff a little venemous Wretch not Mr  Pope  is lash'd for his Ribaldry and his ill Nature and this Author makes one  W C  without any other Proof but his bare Word to declare  That they have insulted the Fallen the Friendless the Exil'd and the Dead  It is plain he would in this Place put his  W C  upon us for one not well affected to our present Establishment It is very well there is no such Person as this  W C  If there should be such a one and he should have a Place under the Government what Chastisement would not this low Author merit for putting these Words into his Mouth We do very well know some People have  fallen  in the unhappy Divisions of our Country as he gently terms the late unnatural Rebellion some  are Friendless some Exil'd  and  others Dead  and therefore those who have written against these People must bear the Lash of our Author's Satyr if it be true that they have insulted these People let our Author remember that they first insulted their Country and its Laws  This same Friend of his goes on and does now discover some Fears that hang about him least he should be taken for a Fool or a Knave by keeping Mr  P  Company though it luckily happens that his writing this Letter has determined his Character yet he very judiciously conceives it was his Duty to vindicate him in Print from all Calumny or to be deemed either the One or the Other so that according to this Notion all the Acquaintance of Mr  P  are oblig'd to Print in his Vindication or to be esteemed Fools or Knaves Here the Author puts forth his whole Head  This can only be the overweening Conceit of a Selfsufficient Writer an assuming spurious Classick asserting his Supremacy and demanding Obedience as you will see for immediately after this he affects the Regal Stile he causes his  W C  to proclaim his Royalty and accordingly he issues his Edicts That all Offenders against  him shall be chastised  He likens  them  to  Assassins  he says  Poverty shall not be any Excuse  nor  to be pleaded before  him no more than  at the Old Baily  neither shall they says he receive  the Benefit of the Clergy  But some Time after this his Majesty cools he is graciously pleas'd to shew Mercy and he makes his Herald  W C  to grant his  Dunces a little Bread and a little Fame  How ridiculous is it to see a diminutive strutting Thing erecting himself into a MockSovereign A modest  Homuncio  who at the same Time that he privately assassinates calls those whom he wounds Assassins But let us consider this Author of the  Dunciad  as he really is a Person Poetically mad jealous of Fame and envious of every Rival grasping at the smallest Shadow of Reputation all his Attention fix'd to one Point raving after imaginary Honours and seeking Infamy in Fame and we shall incline to Pity rather than Censure This throws into ones Mind the Situation of the Mad Taylor in  Bedlam  who called himself  Alexander the Great  was gracious and bountiful and just and cruel and victorious and good and bad as those Ideas struck his sick Brain  By this Time Sir you may imagine I am not a little weary of raking into this Heap of Nonsense and Vanity now before me but as I now cast my Eye forward I can't help observing upon this imaginary Letter Writer where he tells us  The Author of the  Dunciad  has a Contempt for the Writings of those he has written against  This is not at all unlikely One very seldom has a good Opinion of those whom one has an ill Opinion of  but they are Dunces and should be abused for pretending to Wit  If this be the Case neither the Great  Scriblerus  nor  W C  nor Mr  P  himself are exempt from the Lash of Satyr for Great Dignify'd Letter'd as they are somebody may Print and declare them Dunces and attempt to displace this Stupendous Magistrate and all his mad Ministry who usurp the Throne of Wit What a very  Scanderberg  of an Author is this  W C  I mean the Author of the  Dunciad  in his Name goes on and compares  Boileau  to himself What has the Great  Boileau  done to deserve to be compared with an insignificant Ribald But as he is now concluding his elegant Epistle he makes  W C  as is usual in the  Beginning of a new Reign to publish an Act of Grace and Mercy is offered to those who shall repent and merit it These are his Royal Words by  W C If ever He  the Author of the  Dunciad    shall give us an Edition of this Poem himself I may see some of them treated as gently    on their Repentance and better Mind    as  Perault  and  Quinault  were at last by  Boileau  This little bouncing mock Emperor concludes in the Name of  W C  with this singular Observation on Mr  P  's Modesty  that he never wrote a Line that he was ever asham'd or unwilling to own  Now I think it is impossible any Person but Mr  P  himself can be assur'd of this at least nobody but Mr  P  can know that Mr  P  has no manner of Grace or Modesty or Morals and he must be a very Blunderer of a LetterWriter who could venture to assure the Publick so and in the Name of one who pretends to be ambitious of being call'd his Friend  If now Sir after all the Reasons I have given to the contrary this  W C  should happen to be an Existence separate from  Scriblerus  it appears however very plainly from his Manner of Thinking that he is very like him and therefore might easily be mistaken for him In this Case we can only say that the Passion of Friendship has misled him and we must forgive the Weakness of his Head for the Warmth of his Heart This Praiseworthy Zeal for maintaining a Cause the Goodness or Badness of which the Advocate is absolutely ignorant of reminds me of a Story told me by a very merry old Fellow who was in his Youth enroll'd as a private Gentleman in the LifeGuards of King  William  He was in Esteem with the rest of the Troop as a  Soldier of Letters  and was call'd by the Gentlemen of the Belt by Way of Distinction  The Schollar  This Character he bore unrival'd for some Time 'till a Brother of the Sword grew jealous of his Reputation and set up against him His Rival who had been Bookkeeper to a Carrier and from thence derived his Title to Letters took every Opportunity of opposing him when any Subject a little out of the Reach of the rest of the Company was started One Evening my Friend in the Height of his Argument threw out a Sentence of  Tully  and was immediately taken up by his Antagonist for  false Latin  the Debate ran high the Troop divided upon the Point and yet were unwilling to determine positively in a Cause into the Merits of which they could not see 'till one who was the Bookkeeper's Comrade a very brave tho' not a learned Man pull'd him by the Sleeve and leading him into a private Room directed him to lay his Hand upon his Heart and inform him  upon his Honour  Whether the  Words spoken  were true or false Latin  And being answer'd upon his  Honour  they were  false Latin  he return'd immediately into the Circle of the Warriors they had left and placing his Hand on his Sword declar'd with great Intrepidity That the  Latin  the Gentleman had spoken was  false Latin  and he would maintain it  I am  SIR c  RICHARD SMITH  WHEREAS a certain untowardly downlooking Fellow who would be deemed of Quality and is indeed  Filius Populi  has taken upon him the Office of  P  's Nuncio and published in CoffeeHouses several scurrilous and scandalous Bulls or Lampoons of his Holiness his Master This is to let him know that he is found out and if he goes on he will be punish'd as the Laws and Statutes of this Realm shall require  A LETTER TO A Noble LORD Occasion'd by the late Publication of the  Dunciad Variorum    Turpitudo Personae ejus in quam liberius invehimur nos Vindicabit Ignosces etiam Iracundiae nostrae que justa est in ejusmodi Homines Cives  Cicero  My LORD  April the th  TOGETHER with the  Dunciad  I am to return your Lordship many Thanks for the Loan of so uncommon a Piece which cannot but be highly welcome to all the true Lovers of Scandal since it leaves them no Room to doubt as to most of the Persons libell'd in it You were pleas'd to assure me my Lord that it was left at your House by an unknown Hand and that you were an utter Stranger both to the Author and to the Nature of his Performance It is but reasonable therefore that I should satisfy  your Lordship as to these two Particulars in Return for your Goodness in lending me this Book when I had sought for it in vain by the Means of all the Booksellers and Publishers in Town It may not be improper at the same Time to acquaint you that Copies have been left at many Peers Houses in the same Manner as your Lordship's was whilst the Favourites of the Author have had whole Cargoes sent them to dispose of Thus has a little insignificant Lampooner with unparallell'd Impudence made People of the first Quality privy to and some of them innocently Publishers of his Scandal for which doubtless he will be chastised as he deserves  I find at the Head of this  Libel  a long stupid Letter which tho' subscrib'd by another Name must doubtless by  Scriblerus  's or which is the same Thing the Author of the  Dunciad  's Encomium upon himself He has I know not with what Intent brought in the Praises too of one Mr  Pope  maliciously insinuating that this Poem was of his composing which one would fancy it impossible it should be for that Writer after having acquir'd the Dignity of a  Poet  would surely never condescend to accept of the Office of  Scavenger  and rake into all the Filth of the Town I confess I at first conceiv'd the Name subscribed to this Letter to be such an one as  Scriblerus  but I have been since assured that it is no fictitious Name but the real one of a Person now living who is deeply read in the Indexes of Books and the Secret Histories of Families Whether this be the Letterwriter's establish'd Character or not the World must judge but this I will venture to affirm that as the  Real  Author of the  Dunciad  can add no Reputation to this  William Cleland  so this  William Cleland  can add no Reputation to the Author of the  Dunciad  Should there be any Thing here like the Association between the Lion and the Jackcall I believe in this Case the  Jackcall  would prove the  greater Beast  of the Two Not that I would be hereby thought to exclude this Person from any Title he may have to the other of these Appellations I remember to have been present at a Trial for a Rape wherein the Girl to prove her former Chastity brought in an old Bawd for her Evidence Doubtless this Story will admit of no Application in the present Case but to use a Scrap of this Man's own Scrap of  Latin    FASTIDITIS GRATIAM  Being then oblig'd to presume that Mr  Pope  's known Veracity and good Nature would not admit him to be suspected of having wrote such an Heap of Lies and Abuse as is contained in the  Dunciad  I have used my utmost Endeavours to discover the true Author of that Poem and having  succeeded in my Research I have prefix'd to this Tract his  Effigies  as it has been exactly transcrib'd from a  Busto  which was return'd upon a certain ingenious Sculptor's Hand for resembling in a most unflattering Manner the Original By the  rueful  Features of it I am confident your Lordship will immediately discover who is the renown'd Father of the  Dunciad  You will not I am sure expect that I should enter into an Examination of the Poetical Merit of that Piece that would subject me to a Task for which I am wholly unfit I mean the reading it a second Time But I am well inform'd that the Reception which the first Edition met with from the Town shewed that the Performance was thought as mean as the Design In my cursory View of it tho' I met with some Lines here and there Poetical enough yet I thought the Generality of them very Prosaick the whole Tale loose and unconnected the Transitions unnatural the Parodies on the most admir'd Passages of the Ancients were not only too frequent but likewise too faintly and poorly wrought up either to strike or delight the Reader and besides the Nastiness of the  Games  and of all the Imagery in the Poem the very Language often sunk into downright Ribaldry as when a  Gentlewomans Breasts  are stiled her  ForeButtocks  or her  Cowlike Udders  Upon the whole I judg'd this  Dunciad  to be below all Criticism both as to its Stile and Versification  Indeed the Morality of it as well as of the Notes of  Scriblerus  and  Variorum  may deserve a much stricter Scrutiny Felons in the Condemn'd Hold at  Newgate  who have no Characters to forfeit and but little Enjoyment of Life to lose may venture to attack the Reputations of other Men without Fear or Shame but unless under those Circumstances none but a Madman could be tempted to do it How shall I astonish your Lordship then when I assure you that no desperate Raver but a poor Reptile who as he is the most helpless is likewise the most timid Creature living has acted this Part He is become a voluntary Prisoner to his own House rather than not enjoy the pitiful Pleasure of aspersing with Impunity Persons all of them better Members of the Community than himself and many of them of a much higher Rank in Life than he must ever pretend to who can only derive a  Mock Title  not from his Ancestors but his Shoulders In his first Edition he had traduc'd certain Characters for which every one has always had the utmost Veneration and thinks now by leaving out the Names of some and falsly filling up the  Blanks of others as well as by absconding for a Time to escape the Stripes that ought to be the just Reward of such Writings How monstrous therefore has it been to insinuate that they have reach'd a Presence where  Good Nature    Truth  and  Humanity  only can be graciously receiv'd or encourag'd the Reverse whereof are the  Characteristicks  of the  Dunciad    I am sensible that the Retailers in Scandal have always endeavour'd to pass upon the World by the laudable Appellation of Satyrists and would take Shelter under the great Names of  Horace    Juvenal  and  Boileau  Not considering that these Precedents will never be to their Purpose those generous Correctors of Vice never attack'd Persons but Errors nor ever expos'd the private Character but the publick Appearance of Men at the same Time taking especial Care to pay the strictest Regard to Truth even while the Scourge was in their Hands and therefore  Boileau  in his own Vindication speaking of  Chapelain  who was a bad Poet says  En blamant ses ecrits ai je d'un Style Affreux  Distille sur sa Vie un Venin Dangereux  I must likewise inform this halflearned Tribe that the  Codrus  of  Juvenal  which these abusive Writers so often quote for their Justification was no real Person but a Name design'd in general to signify any bad Poet  True and just Satyr will always have its Weight Scandal will always be condemn'd The one is beneficial to Society the other is detrimental to it Whensoever a Man has taken upon himself the Profession of any Art or Science by Writing or otherwise he has certainly submitted his Talents therein to the Judgment of the World A Writer therefore who in that Art or Science consistent with good Manners exposes the Defects of his Fellow Writer be it by Ridicule or Argument is guilty of nothing that is blameable but rather does a Praiseworthy Action by endeavouring to rectify the Judgments of Men and prevent Pretenders to Science from imposing on the Publick The censuring an Author then only as such is what every Man has a Right to do from the Moment he appears in Print  Hanc Veniam petimus{que} Damus{que} vicissim  But under this Pretext to attack his private Reputation as a Member of Society must be the Result of the same villainous Principles as would lead a Man to be guilty of Robbery or Murder had he Courage enough for the Road The Civil Magistrate  alone has a Right to enquire into Mens Personal Characters and if they deserve it to expose and punish them And it seems but just that this Authority should be vested solely in him since no one else can with any Certainty be inform'd of what passes in private Life  The Predecessors of the Writer of the  Dunciad  the elaborate Authors of  Grubstreet  have frequently transgress'd this equitable Rule and finding too general a Propensity towards enquiring into the Blemishes of otherwise Great Characters have sometimes been pretty liberal of their Personal Reflections in order to render their several  Dunciads  the more Saleable Yet these Men had at least so much Decency as to do this under feign'd Names or by pointing at Persons only by their initial Letters which were lyable to various Readings Thus whilst the Obscurity of their Scandal screen'd them from Punishment their very Proceeding was a tacit Confession of the Guilt of such Invectives But it was doubtless reserv'd for the  Modest  Author of the  Dunciad  to invent the  Ne plus ultra  of Scandal by calling Men every Way his Superiors  Rogues    Blockheads    Drunkards  and  Liars  in Print with their Names at length whilst he suppresses his own that he may be exempt from the Fear of a very low Punishment but to which his Ears seem to be legally intitled  As this is my first Appearance in Print I have hitherto escap'd the Malice of this Scandalmonger's Pen and do not now write out of any Hatred to him but real Love for Mankind A Regard to Humanity and the Rules of Society have rais'd in me an Indignation against a Writer who has the Insolence to appear in Publick in Defiance of them all I am resolv'd therefore tho' such a Procedure with Relation to any honest Man would be detestable to mark him to the World let us examine a little into the Character of this diminutive Creature who makes so free with those of other Men  I find that upon his first coming to Town out of pure Compassion for his exotick Figure narrow Circumstances and humble Appearance the late Mr  Wycherley  admitted him into his Society and suffer'd him notwithstanding his Make to be his humble admirer at  Will  's and afterwards finding in him a glimmering of Genius recommended him to some People of Rank and introduc'd him to the most eminent Men of Letters which Courtesy he soon after repaid with a satyrical Copy of Verses on his Benefactor This put an End to their Correspondence some Time before Mr  Wycherley  dy'd His Acquaintance by this Means being made with Sir  Richard Steele  and Mr  Addison  they likewise in Compassion to his unhappy Form and destitute Condition  endeavoured to procure him a Support under both by setting on Foot a Subscription in his Behalf it was indeed for a Work which as has since appeared they must have known he was not equal to but they hoped with their friendly Assistance to have supply'd his Defects However his Subscriptions were no sooner full when the little mischievous Urchin no longer able to contain his Malice wrote a Satyr upon both these Gentlemen as he did afterwards an abusive Libel on one of them and as many Things which had pass'd in private Conversation at  Button  's Coffeehouse came to be known by the Lord  O  of which Infidelity  Scriblerus  was suspected he was obliged to absent himself for some Years from thence After this he listed openly in the  Tory  Service and every Week publish'd scandalous Invectives on those very  Whigs  who had been his amplest  Subscribers  He was in this honourable Occupation when the late Queen dy'd and our Poet soon changing his Note found Means to be introduced to some of the young Ladies of the Court Four of these who were his best Friends and Patronesses as they are to any Thing that carries the Face of Wit or Learning he abused in a Scurvy Ballad for which any other Man would have received Correction but in his Case these generous Ladies contented themselves with shewing a Contempt of his Malice and banishing him their Company This did not hinder him from writing a second Lampoon wherein he spared not the most exalted Characters though under feigned Names and adding Treachery to IllNature he threw the scandalous Imputation of having wrote this Libel on a Lady of Quality whose Wit is equal to her Beauty and whose Character might have suffer'd by this impudent Forgery of his But I begin to be tired as I believe your Lordship is too with raking into the dirty Parts of this foul Character I shall therefore pass over the many other low Scenes of his Life to come to his Masterpiece of Scandal the  DUNCIAD  This mishapen Lump of Malice and Illnature at the earnest Request of all his Friends who feared his Abuse more than his Enemies had for some Years forborn writing Lampoons except it were on a  Curl  or a  Lintot  when at last grown weary of this Restraint and unable to live in Peace with Society he collected a List of Names yet unabused by him and resolved to throw them together into one Satyr To furnish himself therefore with Matter he went round all his Cully Booksellers enquiring for Scandal of any Kind and an abusive Story being told him of a Parson in Drink which the Relater thought could not come within his Scheme of Satyr as reflecting upon one that had never appear'd in Print he told him  that he was resolved to put it down to  Laurus  for as to the  Truth  of it the Town would never be at the Trouble to enquire into that  Thus compiled and thus composed the  DUNCIAD  made its Appearance last Summer and was so universally exploded for its witless Illnature and Falshood that the Gentlemen traduced in it being only pointed at by their Initial Letters did not think it worth their Care to correct the Author in the Manner he deserv'd Yet I have been credibly inform'd that some of them resorted to no Place where  Scriblerus  might possibly be met with without the Provision of a Rod to whip this  Old Boy  for his untoward Malice But he absconding for above a Month and the Scandal having hurt no Creature but the Author himself their Resentment cool'd and the little Lampooner might have been at Peace had he not wantonly reviv'd the Memory of his former Malice by reprinting this pitiful Poem on Royal Paper giving at full Length the Names of most of those mention'd in It together with a Comment more abusive than the Text which he published under an Appellation very proper to himself I mean that of  Scriblerus  This was such a consummate Piece of Insolence as one would think could admit of no Aggravation yet he found Means to add one Degree of Impudence more to it by presuming at first to make Men of Rank and Quality in a Manner his  Publishers  Your Lordship may wonder that one who has conducted himself after this Manner should not have suffer'd under the due Correction of some of those whom he has thus wantonly abused It is most certain that nothing in the Figure of a Man could have escaped Punishment for such repeated Insults many of them on Persons of Distinction But this Poetaster having unhappily a Resemblance in his Size and Make to the Animal much inferior to Man it seems he has been universally look'd upon as beneath the Dignity of Resentment Upon this Occasion I cannot but call to Mind a Story which I have somewhere read of an honest Highlander who was walking along  Holborn  when he heard a Voice cry  Rogue Scot Rogue Scot  his Northern Blood fired at the Insult and he drew his broad Sword looking round him on every Side to discover the Object of his Indignation when at last he found that the Voice came from a Parrot perch'd on a Balcony within his Reach But the  Generous Scot  disdaining to stain his Trusty Blade with such ignoble Blood put up his Sword again with a sour Smile saying  Gin ye were a Mon as ye're a Green Geuse I would split your Weem  A Sword indeed has never been deem'd a Weapon fit for the Correction of Libellers  Thersites  who in Mr  Pope  's  Homer  resembles our Author both in Shape and Malice was cudgell'd by  Ulysses  for his faucy Language to his Betters  Aretin  the only Author besides that of the  Dunciad  within these Three Hundred Years that acquired a famous Infamy by his Pen bragg'd of keeping many Kings and Princes tributary to him in order to purchase an Exemption from his Satyrs Yet it seems some of the Princes of his own Country found out a better Method of dealing with him for having been abused by him they order'd the insolent Creature such a Bastinado as at once put an End to his Satyrical Vein And being by this Treatment brought to himself he had such a true Sense of his vile Character that he turned his Mind wholly toward Devotion In which Strain he wrote many Books with such Success as to obtain at length the Name of the  Divine Aretin  Should the like Treatment of the Father of the  Dunciad  produce the like Effect what Service might he not be of to Religion by composing Pious Hymns for the great Festivals of the Year and perhaps by a Translation of all the  Psalms  the first of which it seems he has already imitated in a most edifying Manner Were  Scriblerus  to undertake the whole  Psalms  and perform that Work with the Justness and Accuracy of his other Translations it might not only eclipse  Sternhold  and  Hopkins  but even vie with that of  Tate  and  Brady  And then what would not the Publick owe to those who by the  Human  Means of a Stick should have wrought so useful as well as  praeter natural  a  Conversion  But  Aretin  had the Shape of a Man and might bear a  Beating  whereas our Poet must of Necessity expire under the very first Blow and he can by the Structure of his Person only be liable to one Sort of Correction that of the  Rod  which some Years ago Mr  Ambrose Philips  being abused by him bought for his Use and stuck up at the Bar of  Button  's Coffeehouse and which he avoided by his usual Practice after every Lampoon of remaining a close Prisoner at Home The same Discipline was prepar'd for him last Summer which he escap'd in the Manner abovementioned and I am inform'd that the Rods are now ready for his Chastisement as soon as he shall be found in a proper Place for whipping  In the mean Time as all Criminals who fly from Justice are executed in  Effigie  his Figure is exposed and four Inscriptions under it on the several Sides of the Pedestal in  Greek    Latin    Spanish  and  English  In the  Greek  and  Latin  for having offended those Languages  by presuming to translate or imitate what he did not understand And in his native Tongue for having made his  British  Muse which ought to be chaste and delicate to speak the Language of the Stews and of  Billingsgate  The  Spanish Inscription  carries in it an Instruction which might have been of use to him had he read it before he became a  Libeller  instead of a  Satyrist  This curious Image having been communicated to me by one of those who are abused in the  Dunciad  in whose Possession it now is I thought it proper to take a Cut from it which I have prefix'd to this Publication  Whensoever it happens that a worthy Mind is lodg'd in a deform'd Body I am perswaded that all vertuous Men commiserate the Case and far from indulging any Reflections on the Figure would use their utmost Endeavours to make both the Owner and the rest of the World forget it But when as is the sad Fate of the Author of the  Dunciad  a crooked Carcass is become the Habitation of a much more crooked Mind and when this Creature far from being humbled by the irregularity of the Form assign'd him by Providence makes the very Despicableness of it a Protection to him for venting such Malice as he would not dare to utter were he a possible Mark for Indignation to lay hold of I think in such a Case Mind and Body which seem so well adapted to each other should go together and be jointly exhibited and expos'd to the Contempt of that Society which can have no other Reparations made them for the Injuries of such an untoward Animal  A vertuous Man has strongly implanted in him a Philanthropy or innate Humanity which restrains him from reflecting too severely on the Frailties of his Fellow Creatures as remembring that they are all of them of one Species But  Scriblerus  distinguished indeed in a most remarkable Manner by Nature from the rest of Mankind has no Tenderness or Regard for them but looks upon himself as one of a quite different Race of Beings nor shall I ever look upon him in another Light  Where indeed is the Definition of  Man  to which he can be said to answer If  be the Term can he have the Assurance to pretend to that Characteristick who looks with Envy on every Thing that contributes to the Peace or Benefit of Society and is never happy but when he is creating Feuds and Animosities even amongst the most intimate of his Acquintance If Man be stiled a  Rational  Creature will  Scriblerus  come within that Description who knowing how little able he is to defend either his own Character or Person wantonly  begins the Attack on others  Man  is often defined to be a  Risible Animal  were this meant to denote a  Creature that we laugh  at the Author of the  Dunciad  would bid fair to be comprehended but all the Grammarians agree that it signifies an  Animal susceptible of Laughter  which  Scriblerus  was never in good Humour enough with himself or others to be nor has he been observ'd since the Hour of his Birth to have risen above a broad Grin common to him with the Quadrupede most resembling Human Nature Thus whatsoever is the Definition He still appears excluded from the Human Species which may in some Measure account for as well as excuse his universal ill Will to our Race  As I find that this last pompous Edition of the  Dunciad  is in  Quarto  I have conform'd myself to that Size in this Publication that your Lordship may be enabled to bind up this true Account of the  Author  and his  Effigies  with the Work it self since all of them seem calculated for one and the same Purpose to make his  Infamy immortal and his Malice contemptible  I have the Pleasure to give your Lordship in Publick this Testimony of my Obedience and of the Respect with which  I am  My LORD  Your LORDSHIP'  s  Most Obedient Humble Servant WILL FLOGG  THE MARTINIAD  With NOTES  In One BOOK  AT  Twickenham  Chronicles remark  There dwelt a little Parish Clerk  A peevish Wight full fond of Fame  And  Martin Scribler  was his Name  Meagre and wan and Steeplecrown'd  His Visage long and Shoulders round  His crippled Corps two Spindle Pegs  Support instead of Human Legs  His shrivel'd Skin of dusky Grain  A Cricket's Voice and Monkey's Brain  This  Martin  had the Knack of Rhime  And spent at  Crambo  all his Time  Lampoons and Songs devis'd so plenty  While He made Ten You scarce told Twenty  Whoever durst in Verse indite  He had him strait in Black and White  Was any Neighbour caught in Liquor  Martin  compar'd him to the Vicar  No Features could with him find Grace  The long he call'd a  Rueful Face    The Man who 'rose to the  Rotund    He sunk him down in  dull Profund  No Sex no Age no State forbore  The Dead the Living Rich or Poor  Wise Fool Young Old Fat Lean or neither  Martin  lampoon'd 'em all together  The Parish thus abus'd determine  To crush the rhyming biting Vermin  They Cudgels Rods and Whips prepare  Of this Clerk  Martin  was aware  And skulk'd behind a Northern Lout  Of Shoulders broad and Visage Stout  This Loon he caught and much caress'd him  And thus in guileful Wise address'd him  "You are I ween a Beuklearn'd  Scot    "Unlike our Dunces here I wot  "I write alas but what I write  "These dull ones only gibe and slight  "Now would you be so good to own  "My Work 'twould hugely please the Town  "Instead of mine then set your Name  "And you shall win immortal Fame  The  Scot  thus wheedled by the Clerk  Set to his Name Some say his Mark  This done the Loon stead of his Pack  Had the whole Parish on his Back  REMARKS  The  Martiniad  for so all the Manuscripts reclaim although some Criticks have asserted not without Appearance of Reason that it ought to have been call'd  The Martinee  in Imitation of the  Odyssee  This Poem like That being Historical and loosely told and in no Means rising to the Epic Force of the  Iliad  But as our last Modern Classic  Scriblerus  hath surmounted this Difficulty and call'd his the  Dunciad  we fear not to follow the Guidance of so establish'd an Author especially as he is the Hero of our Poem and so stile this the  Martiniad  At Twickenham  read  Twick'nam  or  Twitt'nam  This Village is at present honour'd with the Residence of a small modern Classic and of some of his Poetical Underlings and Commentators It is most pleasantly situated on the Banks of the Great River  Thames  and hath been celebrated in  Lyric  Poetry by the late Mr  Thomas D'Urfey  who in his  Richmond Balls  speaking of the Inhabitants thereof stileth them  Twick'nam Loobies  A little Parish Clerk  That Office requiring a Talent in Vociferation the same is most elegantly insinuated under the Epithet  Little  it being a receiv'd  British  Adage  Little and Loud  And  Martin Scribler  was his Name  He was not like the Generality of Clerks content with reading or singing the Works of other Men but likewise composed many of his own And perhaps too audaciously as well as too ludicrously invaded the Sacred Province of  King David  by vying with him in Psalmody Tho' I am told that our  Martin  went no farther than the First Psalm not having met with any Sort of Encouragement in that Undertaking  Steeple Crown'd  A most adequate Expression for the Crown of a ParishClerk whose  Head  in this Respect bears a  Resemblance to a Steeple inasmuch as both are intended for the Omament of the Church What  Church Scribler's SteepleCrown  now adorneth is as much a Question as it was anciently what City might claim the Birth of  Homer  However it should seem by the  Crown  being its self a  Steeple  that  Martin  's  Typical Head  belonged to some  Church  that claimed to  itself  the Supremacy  Cricket  's  Voice  This is an Animal famous for the Smallness of his Voice and Legs He is observed to creep into the Chimneys of old Houses where there is much Filth and Nastiness and where the Walls are full of Holes Hence Men who get into Families only to pick up Scandal and find out their Flaws are often assimilated to  Crickets  Monkey's Brain  This is not to be understood in a literal Sense but metaphorically And as Monkeys are commonly mischievous Mimicks we are to understand those Dispositions to have been in our ParishClerk  While He made Ten you scarce told Twenty  This is a very quaint Parody on the  of  Whoever durst in Verse indite  He had him strait in Black and White  There is a very wide Difference between the Manuscripts of the best Authority as to the Reading of this Distick That of the Vatican has it  Did any one but go to Sh  He had him down in Black and White  And this  Reading  they support from Authorities out of  Scribler  's own  Dunciad  where Expressions tantamount are very frequent  The  Alexandrine  Copy to which we shall pay all due Veneration runs thus  Did any drop their Evening Cates  Whip a Lampoon was at their Gates  This Lection is not likewise unsupported with Authorities but we adhere to the Text as conveying the most cleanly  Ideas  The Vicar  A very inoffensive Divine who had never given  Clerk any Provocation but he could not bear any one of a Rank superior to his in the Church and was offended at the Vicar's pretending to sing in another Key than He had set the Psalm and therefore trump'd up a Story of his being found drunk in a Kennel  Rueful Face  How blind alas are all Mortals in their own Case you see our  Martin  can sneer at the Countenances of others when in the whole Parish of  Twickenham  there was not a more  Rueful Face  than his own  Vid Essigies Scribleri  at the Head of this Publication  Rotund  An Expression in  Scriblerus  for Plump denoting as He says  Obesity  and He is of Opinion that a Fat Man cannot be a Man of Wit For although he seemeth to admit  Guts  in a  Man's Brain  He will not allow of  Brains  in his  Guts  Dull Profund  The Manuscripts read  DEEP  but  corrige meo periculo DULL  as in the Text our Clerk's  Prosund  being very Shallow  ut omnibus constat  Lampoon'd them all together  The Churchwardens of  Twickenham  affirm that there was a Gathering made for  Martin  for his  Christmas  Hymn he being at that Time so poor that he was a perfect Burden on the Parish and they say he no sooner got the Money than he lampoon'd the whole Village but chiefly the Churchwardens and those who had been the chief Contributors towards his Collection  To crush the rhiming biting Vermin  The Scholiast will have it  crack  as an Expression more apposite to an Insect that bites For saith this learned Annotator whoever heard of  crushing  a  Louse  or a  Flea  Cudgels Rods and Whips  These are the Instruments commonly made use of for the Chastisement of Seurvy Lampooners  Vid  Dunciad  Lib  II  V    sequent  Northern Lout  alias  MINSHEW  drives the same from  Lutum  Mud or Dirt but  SKINNER  from Loeyes  Saxon  for a  Layman  or Leos one of the Vulgar It signifies one of the Scum or Dregs of the People  And Visage stout  This Hemistich be of no farther Use than to fill up the Verse which without it would have remain'd imperfect These neutral Expressions are in the  Crast  of Poetry call'd  REPLENISHERS  I could give you many Instances out of our Classick  Scriblerus  but shall content myself with one in the  Dunciad Variorum    Lib  III  V    It stood in the first Edition thus  Thy Dragons  and  shall taste  And from each Show rise duller than the last  And I take it the true Reason why our Poet left those Gaps was because he could not fill them up But one Mr  having call'd upon him in a very earnest Manner to do him that Favour he discover'd two  Replenishers  or in the Political Language  StopGaps  and the Verse ran thus  Thy Dragons  Magistrates  and  Peers    And it might as well have been  Thy Dragons  Shrieves  and  Swordbearer  shall taste  Or else to rise higher  Thy Dragons  May  and  Aldermen  shall  taste  Or it might have done to the full as well thus  Thy Dragons  Fa fe fi fo fum  shall taste  From this one Instance the curious Reader may discover that a Replenisher is a Word which adds to the Measure without affecting the Sense of the Verse not unlike the false Calves worn by the  Spindleshank'd  which help the outward Appearance of the Leg without contributing any Thing to its Strength  This Loon Loon  in  Minshew  is said to signify the same as  Lout  but in  Bailey  it is made to denote a  dull heavy headed Fellow    lazy  and  good for Nothing  Beauk learn'd Scot  Here our Author in speaking of a  Scotchman  very humorously and elegantly falls into the very Dialect of that Country doubtless in Imitation of the Classic Author of the  Dunciad  where he speaks of  Wormius  a great  Antiquary  and maketh use of the old  English  Style calling him the  Myster Wight  As to the Term  Beuklearn'd  I find our Scholiast observes that this  Scotchman  was apt to examine Books as expert Jockeys do Horses only by their  Head  and  Tail  and was therefore deeply read in the  Title Pages  and  Indexes only  Immortal Fame Corrige meo periculo  and read  Immoral Fame  For altho' all the Manuscripts agree with the Text yet is it very manifest that the spurious  t  must have crept into the first Manuscript by the Inaccuracy of the  Transcriber  who being doubtless one of little Genius did not perceive how  it was to attribute the Word  Immortal  to the  Fame  of any of  Scriblers  Works And this Error being once crept in the servile Transcribers have all follow'd one another in it From this one Example I think the Reader may infer notwithstanding the vulgar Opinion to the contrary That  Good Sense  is required to constitute a True  Critick  Pack  Denotes a Bundle of Cloaths or Linen the Form of which is peculiar to those of  North Britain  many of the Inhabitants whereof come up to  London  with one of these at their Back and as soon as they can get into a more genteel Method of Travelling are apt to forget the  Pack  they came up with We may affirm that our  Highland Loon's Pack  is fuller of Scandal than of Linnen  Had the whole Parish  This must be understood figuratively For although  Milo  arriv'd to the Strength of carrying an  Ox  yet had he ennur'd himself thereto by bearing him daily on his Shoulders from a  Calf  So had our Highlander first bore  one  then  two  then  three  Men peradventure he might have attained to the Force of carrying a great Number but to think that he could step from a  Pack  at once to bear a whole  Parish  is unnatural and absurd Wherefore by  Parish  are here understood the  Cudgels    Rods  and  Whips  of the said  Parish  and for these his Back seemeth to have been broad enough  FINIS  APPENDIX  A Curious Receipt wherein is disclosed the Art of writing Poetry with a small Genius taken from  MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS's  Writings  READER be thou Gentle or be thou otherwise I have alway thy Profit and Pleasure before mine Eyes from the which I shall not readily swerve else mayest Thou in all Probability cast me off as is usually practic'd with unprofitable Servants As I have by my Sagacity discover'd certain mechanical Rules by the Help whereof  Scriblerus  hath obtained unto himself the Name of a mighty Poet I question not but the imparting the same unto Thee will be of Contentment and Delight It may furthermore be a Work conducive toward the Strength and Glory of this my native Island by multiplying the Number of Poets therein These have hitherto been but few from a mistaken Opinion that a Genius Learning and a good Ear were requisite to constitute a Poet whereas from the following plain and easy Rules it will most evidently appear that Application and Practice only are necessary By the Help of these I will undertake that any industrious  Englishman  may in the Space of one Month become as great a Versificator as even the Great  Scriblerus  himself  Let the Man then whose sublime Passion it is to shine in Poesy accustom himself to  Tautophonys  or Ingeminations of Sounds This is  most effectually perform'd by selecting Words that begin with the same Consonant and these placed at due Distances Two Three or more in one and the same Verse create a Musick in Poetry insomuch as that the Lines so composed may be indifferently either  sung  or  said  Of a Truth this is an Art which seemeth to have escaped the Knowledge of all the Antients whether of  Greece  or of  Rome  and was hidden from the most celebrated even of our  British  Poets being like many other inestimable Secrets wrapt in the dark  Womb  of Time to be brought to Light only by the skilfull  Midwifery  of the Renowned  Scriblerus  Some Traces indeed there are of this Art amongst some of the Monkish Writers from whence our Poet may have taken the Hint But the Monks never reduc'd the same to any regular Practice as our modern Classick hath done nor did they make use thereof in any but  Latin  Verses and those chiefly  Technical  ones for the Help of Memory So that the Invention or at least the Perfection of this  Nostrum  is owing to  Martinus  Conformable to his Rules were I to mention an Author whose Pride could bear no Fame but his own and that of his servile Flatterers I would make the Verses run thus  Poets support like Pamper'd Priests their Pride  Such Stigmatize as Stick not to their Side  Where the well chosen  P  's of the first Line and the soft hissing  S  's of the Second compose a most excellent Harmony But past all Peradventure Courteous Reader for such doubtless by this Time thou art become thou mayest deem it more for thy Instruction to learn this Poetical Jingle in the Words of  Scriblerus  himself  Dunciad Lib v  She sees a Mob of Metaphors

thousand more Instances of the same Nature for indeed there are not any two Lines together in the whole  Dunciad  or in any other of the  Writings  of this Author wherein the same  mechanical Trick  is not practised And it is from thence that He hath acquir'd the Name of  Melodious Martin  and not as hath been falsely insinuated from his having sung his own Psalm in a certain Lutheran Congregation the which we esteem of only as a fictitious Tale devis'd for Mirth it being well known that our Poet belongeth to a much more ancient  Church  But to return to our Subject Whosoever by an unwearied Exercise in Vocabularies and Dictionaries of Rhyme shall have replenish'd the Tubes of his Memory with Similar Sounds will in Proportion to his Application and Labour therein rival or even surpass if possible the Merit of our Great  Martinus  Any Person moderately vers'd in Poetical Works must have remark'd that Adjectives are most commonly foisted in not to add to the Sense but in order to fill up the Measure of a Verse In all such Emergencies it behoveth our Apprentice in Poesy to make a most fervent Search for an Adjective that beginneth with the same Letter as his Substantive even although the Context should seem to suffer thereby Thus must  Comfort  always be cold the  Day  at Noon  Dawning  the  Fury  even of  Scriblerus Fatal    Garments Gorgeous  though all tatter'd  Head Heavy    Limbs Lazy    Mind Muddy    Night Noisy    Plight Pleasing  be it never so sad  Quail Quivering    Rake Reeling  tho' sober  Sot Social  and  Treat  or  Theobald Tasteless  True it is that  this ingenious Gentleman hath manifested as good a Taste as any of our Writers whatsoever but what hath Truth to do with  Scriblerick  Poetry His Name and  Tasteless  both commence with the same Letter and therefore untill He shall present us with a more convenient Adjective beginning with a T He must be contented with this abusive and unjust one  Euphoniae Gratia  These Adjectives or others in their Stead having been choicely collected as has been premis'd out of the Dictionary constant Regard being had to the initial Consonant they must at sometimes immediately precede or follow their Respective Substantives and at others may be sever'd at a due Distance from the same from whence will result a most delectable Variety of Harmony For the first Sort take this  Example    Form'd was his Figure Foul in Limbs in Face  A Perfect Parody on human race  But Reader Thou wilt be much more edify'd with the Words of  Martinus  the Father and undisputed Inventor of

this Poetick Licence let me furnish unto thee a  Scriblerick  Instance  Scurvy Shall Sound thy Scandal to Mankind  And as thy Make so Monstrous is thy Mind  But without all Doubt the Reader coveteth

Diversity of Examples These must suffice to give Thee full Light into this Mystery the Rest must be the Result of thine own Diligence in putting this Precept Properly in Practice  Proceed we then to certain other mechanical Rules whereby great and eminent Poets may be produc'd without the Help of Genius In the second Place therefore the  Hiatus in M S valde Deflendus  Although in this Place there be a Gap in our Manuscript which can never enough be lamented by the Learned yet are there preserv'd to us many Fragments of the same containing most curious Secrets  but as they are replete with Quotations from  Scriblerus  I must defer exhibiting them 'till a more convenient Season I think in the long Winter Nights in which all well regulated Families assemble round the Chimney a Present of this Nature may not be uncomfortable At such a Season should any one endued with an even steady Voice read the many Excerptions out of  Scriblerus  contain'd in the remaining Parts of this Manuscript what with the genial Warmth of the Fire the Lullaby whistling of the Wind and the  Monotony  or Sameness of Sound in the Verses That Slumber might effectually be procur'd which is so soporiferously describ'd in the second Book of the  Dunciad  Perhaps that good Effect might be produc'd at this very Hour without any concurring Helps were it possible to find People whose Blood in Spring ran sluggish enough to sit still and hear such a  Work  read to them  Notwithstanding the great Veneration I have for the Author of the preceding Manuscript yet must I beg leave to animadvert on one Assertion therein which I take to be erroneous  viz  That the  Divine Art of Ingemination of Sounds  in Poesy was the sole Invention of  Martinus Scriblerus  whereas in Justice to the Memory of his Predecessor Mr  John Grub  the Great Founder of the Street and Sect which still bear his Name I shall venture to affirm that he was no Stranger to this Mystery This will most evidently appear by a most curious Fragment of his which I shall here subjoin and which perhaps may be a Present as welcome to the Publick as those many Books of  Tacitus  said to have been lately retriev'd by the Fidelity of the  Constantinopolitan  Library Keeper who may well be styl'd the  Bentley  of the East Such is the Beauty of the Allegory couch'd in the few Lines of our Fragment and such the Harmony of its Versification as may justly entitle it to a Place in the next  Edition  of the  Dunciad  The Verses of Mr  Grub  are as follow  Thus Trojan Boots ting'd with Tartarean Glue  Near which the Greasy Great Gambadoes Grew  While Coaches rumbled round my Roman Nose  And green Iniquity grew grey in Prose  I intended here to have taken Leave of my Patient Reader for such doubtless he is who has been so good as to accompany me thus far but reflecting with my self That our  Martinus  hath not had the Leisure or Occasion of celebrating the due Praises of his  Panegyrical  Letter Writer  I have
