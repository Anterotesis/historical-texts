 CLARISSA OR THE HISTORY OF A YOUNG LADY Comprehending The most  Important Concerns  of  Private LIFE  And particularly shewing The DISTRESSES that may attend the Misconduct Both of PARENTS and CHILDREN In Relation to MARRIAGE Published by the  EDITOR  of  PAMELA  VOL IV  LONDON Printed for S Richardson And Sold by JOHN OSBORN in  Paternoster Row  ANDREW MILLAR overagainst  Catharinestreet  in the  Strand  J and JA RIVINGTON in  St Paul's Churchyard  And by J LEAKE at  Bath  MDCCXLVIII  THE  EDITOR  to the  READER    IF it may be thought reasonable to criticise the Public Taste in what are generally supposed to be Works of mere Amusement or modest to direct its Judgment in what is offered for its Entertainment I would beg leave to introduce the following Sheets with a few cursory Remarks that may lead the common Reader into some tolerable conception of the nature of this Work and the design of its Author  THE close connexion which every Individual has with all that relates to MAN in general strongly inclines us to turn our observation upon human affairs preferably to other attentions and impatiently to wait the progress and issue of them But as the course of human actions is too slow to gratify our inquisitive curiosity  observant men very easily contrived to satisfy its rapidity by the invention of  History  Which by recording the principal circumstances of past facts and laying them close together in a continued narration kept the mind from languishing and gave constant exercise to its reflections  BUT as it commonly happens that in all indulgent refinements on our satisfactions the Procurers to our pleasures run into excess so it happened here Strict matters of fact how delicately soever dressed up soon grew too simple and insipid to a taste stimulated by the Luxury of Art They wanted something of more poignancy to quicken and enforce a jaded appetite Hence the original of the first barbarous  Romances  abounding with this false provocative of uncommon extraordinary and miraculous Adventures  BUT satiety in things unnatural soon brings on disgust And the Reader at length began to see that too eager a pursuit after  Adventures  had drawn him from what first engaged his attention MAN  and his Ways  into the Fairy Walks of Monsters and Chimeras And now those who  had run farthest after these delusions were the first that recovered themselves For the next Species of Fiction which took its name from its  novelty  was of  Spanish  invention These presented us with something of Humanity but of Humanity in a stiff unnatural state For as every thing before was conducted by  Inchantment  so now all was managed by  Intrigue  And tho' it had indeed a kind of  Life  it had yet as in its infancy nothing of  Manners  On which account those who could not penetrate into the ill constitution of its plan yet grew disgusted at the dryness of the Conduct and want of ease in the Catastrophe  THE avoiding these defects gave rise to the  Heroical Romances  of the  French  in which some celebrated Story of antiquity was so stained and polluted by modern fable and invention as was just enough to shew that the contrivers of them neither knew how to lye nor speak truth In these voluminous extravagances  Love  and  Honour  supplied the place of  Life  and  Manners  But the overrefinement of Platonic sentiments always sinks into the dross and feces of that Passion For in attempting a  more natural representation of it in the little amatory Novels which succeeded these heavier Volumes tho' the Writers avoided the dryness of the Spanish Intrigue and the extravagance of the French Heroism yet by too natural a representation of their Subject they opened the door to a worse evil than a corruption of  Taste  and that was A corruption of  Heart    AT length this great People to whom it must be owned all Science has been infinitely indebted hit upon the true Secret by which alone a deviation from strict fact in the commerce of Man could be really entertaining to an improved mind or useful to promote that Improvement And this was by a faithful and chaste copy of real  Life and Manners  In which some of their late Writers have greatly excelled  IT was on this sensible Plan that the Author of the following Sheets attempted to please in an Essay which had the good fortune to meet with success That encouragement engaged him in the present Design In which his sole object being  Human Nature  he thought himself at liberty to draw a Picture of it in that light which  would shew it with most strength of Expression tho' at the expence of what such as read merely for Amusement may fancy can be illspared the more artificial composition of a story in one continued Narrative  HE has therefore told his Tale in a Series of Letters supposed to be written by the Parties concerned as the circumstances related passed For this juncture afforded him the only natural opportunity that could be had of representing with any grace those lively and delicate impressions which  Things present  are known to make upon the minds of those affected by them And he apprehends that in the study of Human Nature the knowlege of those apprehensions leads us farther into the recesses of the Human Mind than the colder and more general reflections suited to a continued and more contracted Narrative  THIS is the nature and purport of his Attempt Which perhaps may not be so well or generally understood For if the Reader seeks here for Strange Tales Love Stories Heroical Adventures or in short for any thing but a  Faithful Picture of Nature  in  Private Life  he had better be told before hand the likelihood of his being disappointed But if he can find Use or Entertainment either  Directions for his Conduct  or  Employment for his Pity  in a HISTORY  of  LIFE  and  MANNERS where as in the World itself we find Vice for a time triumphant and Virtue in distress an idle hour or two we hope may not be unprofitably lost  THE HISTORY OF Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER I Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday Night May    _WHEN you reflect upon my unhappy situation which is attended with so many indelicate and even shocking circumstances some of which my pride will not let me think of with patience all aggravated by the contents of my cousin's affecting letter you will not wonder that the vapourishness which has laid hold of my heart should rise to my pen And yet it would be more kind more friendly in me to conceal from  you  who take such a generous interest in my concerns that worst part of my griefs which communication and complaint cannot relieve  But to whom can I unbosom myself but to youWhen the man who ought to be my protector as he  has brought upon me all my distresses adds to my apprehensions when I have not even a servant on whose fidelity I can rely or to whom I can break my griefs as they arise and when his bountiful temper and gay heart attach every one to him and I am but a cypher to give him significance and myself painThese griefs therefore do what I can will sometimes burst into tears and these mingling with my ink will blot my paperAnd I know you will not grudge me the temporary relief  But I shall go on in the strain I left off with in my last when I intended rather to apologize for my melancholy But let what I have above written once for all be my apology My misfortunes have given you a call to discharge the noblest offices of the friendship we have vowed to each other in advice and consolation and it would be an injury to it and to you to suppose it needed even that call  She then tells Miss Howe that now her cloaths are come Mr Lovelace is continually teazing her to go abroad with him in a coach attended by whom she pleases of her own sex either for the air or to the public diversions  She gives the particulars of a conversation that has passed between them on that subject and his several proposals But takes notice that he says not the least word of the solemnity which he so much pressed upon her before they came to town and which as she observes was necessary to give propriety to his proposals  Now my dear  says she  I cannot bear the life I live I would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach If I were he should soon see the difference If I must be humbled it had better be by those to whom I owe duty than by him My aunt writes in  er letter  See Vol  III  p    that SHE dare not propose any thing in  my favour You tell me that upon inquiry you find  See Vol  III  p    that had I not been unhappily seduced away a change of measures was actually resolved upon and that my mamma particularly was determined to exert herself for the restoration of the family peace and in order to succeed the better had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle Harlowe in her party  Let me build on these foundationsI can but try my dearIt is my duty to try all  probable  methods to restore the poor outcast to favourAnd who knows but that once indulgent uncle who has very great weight in the family may be induced to interpose in my behalfI will give up all right and title to my grandfather's bequests with all my heart and soul to whom they shall think fit in order to make my proposal palatable to my brother And that my surrender may be effectual I will engage never to marry  What think you my dear of this expedient Surely they cannot resolve to renounce me for ever If they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened they  will  have something to blame  themselves  for as well as  me    I presume that you will be of opinion that this expedient is worth trying But here is my difficulty If I should write my hardhearted brother has so strongly confederated everybody against me that my letter would be handed about from one to another till he had hardened every one to refuse my request whereas could my uncle be engaged to espouse my cause as from  himself  I should have some hope as I presume to think he would soon have my mother and my aunt of his party  What therefore I am thinking of is thisSuppose Mr Hickman whose good character has gained him everybody's respect should put himself in my uncle Harlowe's way And as if from your knowlege of  the state of things between Mr Lovelace and me assure him not only of the above particulars but that I am under no obligations that shall hinder me from taking his directions  I submit the whole to your discretion whether to pursue it at all or in what manner But if it be pursued and if my uncle refuses to interest himself in my favour upon Mr Hickman's application as from you for so for obvious reasons it must be put I can then have no hope and my next step in the mind I am in shall be to throw myself into the protection of the ladies of his family  It were an impiety to adopt the following lines because it would be throwing upon the decrees of Providence a fault too much my own But often do I revolve them for the sake of the general similitude which they bear to my unhappy yet undesigned error  To you great gods I make my last appeal  Or clear my virtues or my crimes reveal  If wand'ring in the maze of life I run  And backward tread the steps I sought to shun  Impute my errors to your own decree  My  FEET  are guilty but my  HEART  is free  Miss Harlowe dates again on Monday to let Miss Howe know that Mr Lovelace on observing her uneasiness had introduced to her Mr Mennell Mrs Fretchville's kinsman who managed all her affairs a young officer of sense and politeness she calls him and who gave her an account of the house and furniture to the same effect that Mr Lovelace had done before as also of the melancholy way Mrs Fretchville is in  She tells Miss Howe how extremely urgent Mr Lovelace was with the gentleman to get his spouse as he now always calls her before company a sight of the house And that Mr Mennell undertook that very  afternoon to shew her all of it except the apartment Mrs Fretchville should be in when she went But that she chose not to take another step till she knew how she approved of her scheme to have her uncle sounded and what success if try'd it would be attended with  Mr Lovelace in his humourous way gives his friend an account of the Lady's peevishness and dejection on receiving a letter with her cloaths He regrets that he has lost her confidence which he attributes to bringing her into the company of his four companions Yet he thinks he must excuse them and censure her for overniceness for that he never saw men behave better at least not  them    Mentioning his introducing Mr Mennell to her  'Now Jack says he was it not very kind of Mr Mennell  Captain  Mennell I sometimes called him for among the military men there is no such officer thou knowest as a  Lieutenant  or an  Ensign  Was it not very kind in him to come along with me so readily as he did to satisfy my beloved about the vapourish lady and the house'  'But who is Captain Mennell methinks thou askest I never heard of such a man as Captain Mennell  'Very likely But knowest thou not young Newcomb 'honest Doleman's nephew  'Oho Is it he  'It is And I have chang'd his name by virtue of my own single authority Knowest thou not that I am a great namefather Preferments I bestow both military and civil I give estates and take them away at my pleasure Quality too I create And by a still more valuable prerogative I  degrade  by virtue of my own imperial will without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience What a poor thing is a monarch to me  'But Mennell now he has seen this angel of a woman has qualms that's the devilI shall have enough to do to keep him right But it is the less wonder that he should stagger when a few hours conversation with the same lady could make four much more harden'd varlets find  hearts  Only that I am confident that I shall at last reward her virtue if her virtue overcome me or I should find it impossible to persevereFor at times I have confounded qualms myself But say not a word of them to the Confraternity Nor laugh at me for them thyself'  In another letter dated Monday night he tells his friend That the lady keeps him at such distance that he is sure something is going on between her and Miss Howe notwithstanding the prohibition from Mrs Howe to both and as he has thought it some degree of merit in himself to punish others for their transgressions he thinks both these girls punishable for the breach of parental injunctions And as to their lettercarrier he has been inquiring into his way of living and finding him to be a common poacher a deerstealer and warrenrobber who under pretence of higgling deals with a set of customers who constantly take all he brings whether fish fowl or venison he holds himself justify'd since Wilson's conveyance must at present be sacred to have him stript and robbed and what money he has about him given to the poor since if he take not money as well as letters he shall be suspected  'To serve one's self says he and punish a villain at the same time is serving public and private The law was not made for such a man as me And I  must  come at correspondencies so disobediently carried on  'But on second thoughts if I could find out that the dear creature carried any of her letters in  her pockets I can get her to a play or to a concert and she may have the misfortune to lose her pockets'  'But how shall I find this out since her Dorcas knows no more of her dressing or undressing than her Lovelace For she is dressed for the day before she appears even to her servantVilely suspiciousUpon my soul Jack a suspicious temper is a punishable temper If a lady suspects a rogue in an honest man is it not enough to make the honest man who knows it a rogue'  'But as to her pockets I think my mind hankers after them as the less mischievous attemptBut they cannot hold all the letters that I should wish to see And yet a woman's pockets are half as deep as she is high Ty'd round them as ballastbags I presume lest the wind as they move with full sail from whaleribb'd canvas should blow away the gypsies'  He then in apprehension that something is meditating between the two ladies or that something may be set on foot to get Miss Harlowe out of his hands relates several of his contrivances and boasts of his instructions given in writing to Dorcas and to his servant Wil  ▪ Summers and says that he has provided against every possible accident even to bring her back if she should escape or in case she should go abroad and then refuse to return and hopes so to manage as that should he make an attempt whether he succeed in it or not he may have a pretence to detain her  He orders Dorcas to cultivate by all means her lady's favour to lament her incapacity as to writeing and reading to shew her lady letters from pretended country relations and beg her advice how to answer them and to get them answer'd to be always aiming at scrawling with a pen lest inky fingers should give suspicions And says that he has given  her an ivoryleaved pocketbook with a silver pencil that she may make memoranda on occasion  The lady has already he says at Mrs Sinclair's motion removed her cloaths out of the trunks they came in into an ample mahogany repository where they will lie at fulllength and which has drawers in it for linen  'A repository says he that used to hold the richest suits which some of the nymphs put on when they are to be dressed out to captivate or to ape quality For many a countess thou knowest has our mother equipp'd nay two or three duchesses who live upon  qualityterms  with their lords But this to such as will come up to her price and can make an appearance like quality themselves on the occasion For the reputation of persons of birth must not lie at the mercy of every underdegreed sinner'  'A masterkey which will open every lock in this chest is put into Dorcas's hands and she is to take care when she searches for papers before she removes any thing to observe how it lies that she may replace all to a hair Sally and Polly can occasionally help to transcribe Slow and sure with such a lady must be all my movements'  'It is impossible that one so young and so inexperienced can have all her caution from herself the behaviour of the women so unexceptionable no revellings no company ever admitted into this innerhouse all genteel quiet and easy in it the nymphs wellbred and wellread her first disgusts to the old one got overIt must be Miss Howe therefore who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our class by honest Sir George Colmar as thou hast heard that makes my progress difficult'  Thou seest Belford by the above  precautionaries  that I forget nothing As he song says it is not to be imagin'd  On what slight strings  Depend those things  On which men build their glory  'So far so good I shall never let my goddess rest till I have first discover'd where she puts her letters and next till I have got her to a play to a concert or to take an airing with me of a day or so'  'I GAVE thee just now some of  my  contrivances Dorcas who is ever attentive to all her lady's motions has given me some instances of her  mistress  's precautions She wafers her letters it seems in two places pricks the wafers and then seals upon them No doubt but those brought hither are taken the same care of And she always examines the seals of the latter before she opens them I must I must come at them This difficulty augments my curiosity Strange so much as she writes and at all hours that not one sleepy or forgetful moment has offer'd in our favour'  'A fair contention thou seest Do not thou therefore reproach me for endeavouring to take advantage of her  tender years Credulity  she has none Am not I a  young fellow  myself As to her  fortune  that's out of the question fortune never had any other attractions for me than to stimulate me on and this as I have elsewhere said for motives not ignoble As to  beauty  pr'ythee Jack do thou to spare my modesty make a comparison between my Clarissa for a  woman  and thy Lovelace for a  man  The only point that can admit of debate as I conceive is who has most  wit  most  circumspection  And that is what remains to be try'd'  'A sad life however for the poor lady to live as well as for me that is to say if she be not  naturally  jealous If she be her uneasiness is constitutional  and she cannot help it nor will it in that case hurt her For a suspicious temper will  make  occasions for doubt if none were to offer to her hand and so my fair one is obliged to me for saving her the trouble of studying for these occasionsBut after all the plain way in every affair of the human life is the best I believe But it is not given me to choose it Nor am I singular in the pursuit of the more intricate paths since there are thousands and ten thousands besides me who had rather fish in troubled waters than in smooth'  LETTER II Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELEORD  Esq    Tuesday May    I Am a very unhappy fellow This lady is said to to be one of the sweetest temper'd creatures in the world And so I thought her But to me she is one of the most perverse I never was supposed to be an illnatur'd puppy neither How can it be I imagin'd for a long while that we were born to make each other happy But quite the contrary we really seem to be sent to plague one another  I will write a Comedy I think I have a title ready and that's half the work  The Quarrelsome Lovers  'Twill do There's something new and striking in it Yet more or less all lovers quarrel Old Terence has taken notice of that and observes upon it That lovers fallingout occasions lovers fallingin and a better understanding of course 'Tis natural that it should be so But with us we fallout so often without fallingin once and a second quarrel so generally happens before a first is made up that it is hard to guess what event our loves will be attended with But Shakespeare says  Come what come may  Patience and time run thro' the roughest day  And that shall be my comfort No man living bears crosses better than myself But then they must be of  my own  making And even This is a great merit and a great excellence think what thou wilt Since most of the troubles which fall to the lot of mortals are brought upon themselves either by their  too large  desires or  too little  deserts But I shall make myself a common man byandby Which is what no one yet ever thought me I will now lead to the occasion of this preamble  I had been out On my return meeting Dorcas on the stairsYour lady in her chamber Dorcas In the diningroom Sir And if ever you hope for an opportunity to come at a letter it must be now For at her feet I saw one lie which by its open'd folds she has been reading with a little parcel of others she is now busied with All pulled out of her pocket as I believe So Sir you'll know where to find them another time  I was ready to leap for joy and instantly resolved to bring forward an expedient which I had held in petto and entering into the diningroom with an air of transport I boldly clasped my arms about her as she sat she huddling up her papers in her handkerchief all the time the dropt paper unseen O my dearest life a lucky expedient have Mr Mennell and I hit upon just now In order to hasten Mrs Fretchville to quit the house I have agreed if you approve of it to entertain her cook her housemaid and two menservants about whom she was very solicitous till you are provided to your mind And that no accommodations may be wanted I have consented to take the houshold linen at an appraisement  I am to pay down l and the remainder as soon as the bills can be look'd up and the amount of them  adjusted Thus will you have a charming house intirely ready to receive you and any of my friends They will soon be with you They will not permit you long to suspend my happy dayAnd that nothing may be wanting to gratify your utmost punctilio I will till then consent to stay here at Mrs Sinclair's while you reside at your new house and leave the rest to your own generosity  O my beloved creature will not this be agreeable to you I am sure it willIt mustAnd clasping her closer to me I gave her a more fervent kiss than ever I had dared to give her before But still let not my ardor overcome my discretion for I took care to set my foot upon the letter and scraped it farther from her as it were behind her chair  She was in a passion at the liberty I took Bowing low I begg'd her pardon and stooping still lower in the same motion took it up and whipt it in my bosom  Pox on me for a puppy a fool a blockhead a clumsy varlet and a mere Jack BelfordI thought myself a much cleverer fellow than I amWhy could I not have been followed in by Dorcas who might have taken it up while I addressed her lady  For here the letter being unfolded I could not put it into my bosom without alarming her ears as my sudden motion did her eyesUp she flew in a moment Traitor Judas her eyes flashing lightning and a perturbation in her eager countenance so charmingWhat have you taken upAnd then what for both my ears I durst not to have done to her she made no scruple to seize the stolen letter tho' in my bosom  Begpardon apologies were all that now remained for me on so palpable a detection I clasped her hand which had hold of the ravish'd paper between mine O my beloved creature can you think I have not  some  curiosity Is it possible you can be thus for  ever employed and I loving narrative letterwriting above every other species of writing and admiring your talent that way should not thus upon the dawn of my happiness as I presume to hope burn with a desire to be admitted into so sweet a correspondence  Let go my handstamping with her pretty foot How dare you SirAt this rate I seeToo plainly I seeAnd more she could not say But gasping was ready to faint with passion and affright the devil a bit of her accustomed gentleness to be seen in her charming face or to be heard in her musical voice  Having gone thus far loth very loth was I to lose my prizeOnce more I got hold of the rumpledup letterImpudent man were her words Stamping again For God's sake then it wasI let go my prize lest she should faint away But had the pleasure first to find my hand within both hers she trying to open my reluctant fingers How near was my heart at that moment to my hand throbbing to my fingers ends to be thus familiarly altho' angrily treated by the charmer of my soul  When she had got it in her possession she flew to the door I threw myself in her way shut it and in the humblest manner besought her to forgive me And yet do you think the Harlowehearted charmer would notwithstanding the agreeable annunciation I came in withNo truly but pushing me rudely from the door as if I had been nothing yet do I love to try so innocently to try her strength too she gaining that force through passion which I had lost through fear and out she shot to her own apartment Thank my stars she could fly no further and as soon as she enter'd it in a passion still she doublelocked and doublebolted herself inThis my comfort on reflection that upon a greater offence it cannot be worse  I retreated to my own apartment with my heart full And my man Will not being near me gave  myself a plaguy knock on the forehead with my double fist  And now is my charmer shut up from me Refusing to see me refusing her meals Resolves  not  to see me that's moreNever again if she can help it  In the mind she is in  I hope she has said The dear creatures whenever they quarrel with their humble servants should always remember this saving clause  that they may not be forsworn    But thinkest thou that I will not make it the subject of one of my first plots to inform myself of the reason why all this commotion was necessary on so slight an occasion as this would have been were not the letters that pass between these ladies of a treasonable nature  Wednesday Morning  No admission to breakfast any more than to supper I wish this lady is not a simpleton after allI have sent up in Capt Mennell's name A message from Capt Mennell Madam  It won't doShe is of a baby age She cannot bea Solomon I was going to say in every thing Solomon Jack was the wisest manBut didst ever hear who was the wisest womanI want a comparison for this lady Cunning women and witches we read of without number But I fancy wisdom never entered into the character of a woman It is not a requisite of the Sex Women indeed make better sovereigns than men But why is thatBecause the women sovereigns are governed by men the men sovereigns by womenCharming by my soul For hence we guess at the rudder by which both are governed Yet sorry puppy as thou art thou makest light of me for my attachment to this Sex and even of my ardors to the most excellent one of it  But to put wisdom out of the question and to take  cunning  in That is to say To consider woman  as  a woman what shall we do if this lady has something extraordinary in her headRepeated charges has she given for Wilson by a particular messenger to send any letter directed for her the moment it comes  I must keep a good lookout She is not now afraid of her brother's plot I shan't be at all surprized if Singleton calls upon Miss Howe as the only person who knows or is likely to know where Miss Harlowe is pretending to have affairs of importance and of particular service to her if he can but be admitted to her speech Of compromise who knows from her brother  Then will Miss Howe warn her to keep close then will my protection be again necessary This will do I believe Any thing from Miss Howe must  Joseph Leman is a vile fellow with her and my implement Joseph honest Joseph as I call him may hang himself I have play'd him off enough and have very little further use for him No need to wear one plot to the stumps when I can find new ones every hour  Nor blame me for the use I make of my talents Who that had such would let 'em be idle  Well then I will find a Singleton that's all I have to do  Instantly  find oneWill  Sir  This moment call me hither thy cousin Paul Wheatly just come from sea whom thou wert recommending to my service if I were to marry and keep a pleasureboat  PrestoWill's gonePaul will be here presentlyPresently will he be gone to Mrs Howe'sIf Paul be Singleton's mate coming from his captain it will do as well as if it were Singleton himself  Sally a little devil often reproaches me with the slowness of my proceedings But in a play does not the principal entertainment lie in the first four acts Is not all in a manner over when you come to the fifth And what a vultur of a man must he be who sowses upon his prey and in the same moment trusses and devours  But to own the truth I have overplotted myself To make my work secure as I thought I have frighted the dear creature with my four Hottentots and I shall be a long time I doubt before I can recover my lost ground And then these cursed folks at HarlowePlace have made her out of humour with me with herself and with all the world but Miss Howe who no doubt is continually adding difficulties to my other difficulties And then I am very unwilling to have recourse to measures which these daemons below are continually urging me to take And the rather as I am sure that at last she must be legally mine One complete trial over and I think I will do her noble justice  WELL Paul's goneGone alreadyHas all his lessonsA notable fellowLord W's necessaryman was Paul before he went to sea A more sensible rogue Paul than JosephNot such a pretender to piety neither as the other At what a price have I bought that JosephI had two to buy in himHis conscience as well as the manI believe I must punish the rascal at last But must let him marry first Then tho' that may be punishment enough as I bribed two at once in one man I shall punish two at once in the man and his wifeAnd how richly does Betty deserve it for her behaviour to my goddess  But now I hear the rusty hinges of my Beloved's door give me creaking invitation My heart creaks and throbs with respondent trepidations Whimsical  enough tho' For what relation has a lover's heart to a rusty pair of hingesBut they are the hinges that open and shut the door of my Beloved's bedchamberRelation enough in that  I hear not the door shut again I shall have her commands I hope anonWhat signifies her keeping me thus at a distanceShe must be mine let me do or offer what I will Courage whenever I assume all is over For should she think of escaping from hence whither can she fly to avoid me Her parents will not receive her Her uncles will not entertain her Her beloved Norton is in their direction and cannot Miss Howe dare not She has not one friend in town but me Is intirely a stranger to the town And what then is the matter with me that I should be thus unaccountably overawed and tyrannized over by a dear creature who wants only to know how impossible it is that she should escape me in order to be as humble to me as she is to her persecuting relations  Should I even make the grand attempt and fail and should she hate me for it her hatred can be but temporary She has already incurred the censure of the world She must therefore choose to be mine for the sake of soldering up her reputation in the eye of that impudent world For who that knows me and knows that she has been in my power tho' but for twentyfour hours will think her spotless as to fact let her inclination be what it willAnd then human nature is such a wellknown rogue that every man and woman judges by what each knows of themselves that inclination is no more to be trusted where an opportunity is given than I am especially where a woman young and blooming loves a man well enough to go off with him for such will be the world's construction in the present case  She calls her maid Dorcas No doubt that I may hear her harmonious voice and to give me an opportunity  to pour out my soul at her feet to renew all my vows and to receive her pardon for the past offence And then with what pleasure shall I begin upon a new score and afterwards wipe out that and begin another and another till the  last  offence passes and there can be no other And once after that to be forgiven will be to be forgiven for ever  THE door is again shut Dorcas tells me that she denies to admit me to dine with her as I had ordered her to request for me next time she saw her Not uncivilly however denies Coming to by degrees Nothing but the last offence the honest wench tells me in the language of her principals below will do with her The last offence is meditating Yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays me bootyBut here I conclude tho' the tyranness leaves me nothing to do but read write and fret  Subscription is formal between us Besides I am so totally hers that I cannot say how much I am thine or any other person's  LETTER III Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday May    IF my dear you approve of the application to my uncle Harlowe I wish it may be made as soon as possible We are quite out again I have shut myself up from him The offence indeed not  very  greatAnd yet it is too He had like to have got a letter One of yours But never will I write again or reperuse my papers in an apartment where he thinks himself intitled to come He did not read a line of it Indeed he did not So don't be uneasy And depend upon future caution  Thus it was The sun being upon my closet and Mr Lovelace abroad  She then gives Miss Howe an account of his coming in by surprize upon her of his fluttering speech of his bold address of her struggle with him for the letter  c  And now my dear  proceeds she  I am more and more convinced that I am too much in his power to make it prudent to stay with him And if my friends  will  but give me hopeTill I can know whether they will or not I must do what I never studied to do before in any casethat is try to keep this difference open And yet it will make me look little in my own eyes because I shall mean by it more than I can own But this is one of the consequences of a step which will be ever deplored by  Your  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER IV Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Wednesday May    I Much approve of your resolution to leave this man if you can have any encouragement from your uncle And the rather as I have heard but within these two hours some wellattested stories of him that shew him to be one of the worst of men as to our Sex I do assure you my dear friend that had he a dozen lives if all I have heard be true he might have forfeited them all and been dead  twenty crimes  ago  If ever you condescend to talk familiarly with him again ask him after Miss Betterton and what became of her And if he shuffle and prevaricate question him about Miss LockyerO my dear the man's a villain  I will have your uncle sounded as you desire and that out of hand But yet I am afraid of the success  and this for several reasons 'Tis hard to say what the sacrifice of your estate would do with some people And yet I must not when it comes to the test permit you to make it  As your Hannah continues ill I would advise you to try to attach Dorcas to your interest Have you not been impoliticly shy of her  I wish you could come at some of his letters Surely a man of his negligent character cannot be always guarded If he were and if you cannot engage your servant I should suspect them both Let him be called upon at a short warning when he is writing or when he has papers lying about and so surprize him into negligence  Such inquiries I know are of the same nature with those we make at an inn in travelling when we look into every corner and closet for fear of a villain yet should be frighted out of our wits were we to find one But 'tis better to detect such a one when awake and up than to be attacked by him when in bed and asleep  I am glad you have your cloaths But no money no books but a  Spira  a  Drexelius  and a  Practice of Piety  Those who sent the latter ought to have kept it for themselvesBut I must hurry myself from this subject  You have excceedingly alarmed me by what you hint of his attempt to get one of my letters I am assured by my new informant that he is the head of a gang of wretches Those he brought you among no doubt were some of them who join together to betray innocent creatures and to support one another when they have done by violence And were he to come at the knowlege of the freedoms I take with him I should be afraid to stir out without a guard  I am sorry to tell you that I have reason to think that your brother has not laid aside his foolish plot A sunburnt sailorlooking fellow was with me just  now pretending great service to you from Captain Singleton could he be admitted to your speech I pleaded ignorance The fellow was too well instructed for me to get any thing out of him  I wept for two hours incessantly on reading yours which inclosed that from your cousin Morden  See Vol  III  Letters  lxxviiilxxix  My dearest creature do not desert yourself Let your Anna Howe obey the call of that friendship which has united us as one soul and endeavour to give you consolation  I wonder not at the melancholy reflections you so often cast upon yourself in your letters for the step you have been forced upon on one hand and tricked into on the other A strange fatality As if it were designed to shew the vanity of all human prudence I wish my dear as you hint that both you and I have not too much prided ourselves in a perhaps too conscious superiority over othersBut I will stopHow apt are weak minds to look out for judgments in any extraordinary event 'Tis so far right that it is better and safer and juster to arraign ourselves or our dearest friends than Providence which must always have wise ends to answer in its dispensations  But do not talk as in one of your former of being a warning  only  See Vol  III  p    You will be as excellent an example as ever you hoped to be as well as a warning And that will make your story to all that shall come to know it of double efficacy For were it that such a merit as yours could not ensure to herself noble and generous usage from a libertine heart who will expect any tolerable behaviour from men of his character  If YOU think yourself inexcusable for taking a step that put you into the way of delusion without any intention to go off with him what must those giddy creatures think of themselves who without half your provocations and inducements and without any regard  to decorum leap walls drop from windows and steal away from their parents house to the seducer's bed in the same day  Again if YOU are so ready to accuse yourself for dispensing with the prohibitions of the most unreasonable parents which yet were but halfprohibitions at first what ought those to do who wilfully shut their ears to the advice of the most reasonable and that perhaps where apparent ruin or undoubted inconvenience is the consequence of the predetermin'd rashness  And lastly to all who will know your story you will be an excellent  example  of watchfulness and of that caution and reserve by which a prudent person who has been supposed to be a little misled endeavours to mend her error and never once losing sight of her duty does all in her power to recover the path she has been rather driven out of than chosen to swerve from  Come come my dearest friend consider but these things and steadily without desponding pursue your earnest purposes to amend what you think has been amiss and it may not be a misfortune in the end that you have erred especially as so little of your will was in your error  And indeed I must say that I use the words  misled  and  error  and suchlike only in compliment to your own too ready selfaccusations and to the opinion of one to whom I owe duty For I think in my conscience that every part of your conduct is defensible and that those only are blameable who have no other way to clear themselves than by condemning you  I expect however that such melancholy reflections as drop from your pen but too often wil  mingle with all your future pleasures were you to marry I ovelace and were he to make the best of husbands  You was immensely happy above the happiness of a mortal creature before you knew him Everybody almost worshiped you Envy itself which has of late reared up its venomous head against you was awed by your superior worthiness into silence and admiration You was the soul of every company where you visited Your elders have I seen declining to offer their opinions upon a subject till you had delivered yours often to save themselves the mortification of retracting  theirs  when they heard  yours  Yet in all this your sweetness of manners your humility and affability caused the subscription every one made to your sentiments and to your superiority to be equally unfeigned and unhesitating for they saw that their applause and the preference they gave you to themselves subjected not themselves to insults nor exalted you into any visible triumph over them for you had always something to say on every point you carried that raised the yielding heart and left everyone pleased and satisfied with themselves tho' they carried not off the palm  Your works were shewn or referred to whereever fine works were talked of Nobody had any but an inferior and secondhand praise for diligence for oeconomy for reading for writing for memory for facility in learning everything laudable and even for the more envied graces of person and dress and an allsurpassing elegance in both where you were known and those subjects talked of  The Poor blessed you every step you trod The Rich thought you their honour and took a pride that they were not obliged to descend from their own class for an example that did credit to it  Tho' all men wished for you and sought you young as you was yet had not those who were brought to address you been encouraged out of sordid and spiteful views to attempt your presence not  one of them would have dared to lift up his eyes to you  Thus happy in all about you thus making happy all within your circle could you think that nothing would happen to you to convince you that you were not to be exempted from the common lotTo convince you that you were not  absolutely  perfect and that you must not expect to pass thro' life without trial temptation and misfortune  Indeed it must be owned that no trial no temptation worthy of you could have well attacked you sooner or more effectually than those heavy ones have done For every common case you were superior to It must be some man or some worse spirit in the shape of one that formed on purpose was to be sent to invade you while as many other such spirits as there are persons in your family were permitted to take possession severally in one dark hour of the heart of every one of it there to sit perching perhaps and directing every motion to the motions of the seducer without in order to irritate to provoke to push you forward to meet him  So upon the whole there seems as I have often said a kind of fate in your error if an error and this perhaps admitted for the sake of a better example to be collected from your  sufferings  than could have been given had you  never erred  For my dear ADVERSITY is your SHININGTIME I see evidently that it must call forth graces and beauties that could not have been seen in a run of that prosperous fortune which attended you from your cradle till now admirably as you became and as we all thought greatly as you deserved that prosperity  All the matter is the trial must be grievous to you It is to  me  It is to all who love you and looked upon you as one set aloft to be admired and imitated and not as a mark as you have lately found for Envy to shoot its shafts at  Let what I have written above have its due weight  ith you my dear and then as warm imaginations  re not without a mixture of enthusiasm your Anna  owe who on reperusal of it imagines it to be in  style superior to her usual style will be ready to flat  er herself that she has been in a manner inspired with the hints that have comforted and raised the de  ected heart of her suffering friend who from such  ard trials in a bloom so tender may find at times  er spirits sunk too low to enable her to pervade the  urrounding darkness which conceals from her the  opeful dawning of the better day which awaits her  I will add no more at present than that I am  Your everfaithful and affectionate  ANNA HOWE  LETTER V Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday May    I Must be silent my exalted friend under praises that oppress my heart with a consciousness of not deserving them at the same time that the generous design of those praises raises and comforts it For it is a charming thing to stand high in the opinion of those we love And to find that there are souls that can carry their friendships beyond accidents beyond body and ties of blood Whatever my dearest creature is  my  shiningtime the adversity of a friend is  yours  And it would be almost a fault in me to regret those afflictions which give you an opportunity so gloriously to exert those qualities which not only ennoble our sex but dignify human nature  But let me proceed to subjects less agreeable  I am sorry you have reason to think Singleton's projects are not at an end But who knows what the sailor had to proposeYet had any good been intended  me this method would hardly have been fallen upon  Depend upon it my dear your letters shall be safe  I have made a handle of Mr Lovelace's bold attempt and freedom as I told you I would to keep him ever since at distance that I may have an opportunity to see the success of the application to my uncle and to be at liberty to embrace any favourable overtures that may arise from it Yet he has been very importunate and twice brought Mr Mennell from Mrs Fretchville to talk about the house If I should be obliged to make up with him again I shall think I am always doing myself a spight  As to what you mention of his newlydetected crimes and your advice to attach Dorcas and to come at some of his letters these things will require more or less of my attention as I may hope favour or not from my uncle Harlowe  I am sorry for poor Hannah's continued illness Pray my dear inform yourself for me whether she wants any thing that befits her case  I will not close this letter till tomorrow is over for I am resolved to go to church and this as well for the sake of my duty as to see if I am at liberty to go out when I please without being attended or accompanied  Sunday May    I HAVE not been able to avoid a short debate with Mr Lovelace I had order'd a coach to the door When I had notice that it was come I went out of my chamber to go to it but met him dressed on the stairs head with a book in his hand but without his hat and swordHe asked with an air very solemn yet respectful if I were going abroad I told him was He desired leave to attend me if I were going to church I refused him And then he complained heavily of my treatment of him and declared that he  would not live such another week as the past for the world  I owned to him very frankly that I had made an application to my friends and that I was resolved to keep myself to myself till I knew the issue of it  He coloured and seemed surprized But checking himself in something he was going to say he pleaded my danger from Singleton and again desired to attend me  And then he told me that Mrs Fretchville had desired to continue a fortnight longer in the house She found said he that I was unable to determine about entering upon it and now who knows when such a vapourish creature will come to a resolution This Madam has been an unhappy week for had I not stood upon such bad terms with you you might have been now mistress of that house and probably had my cousin Montague if not my aunt Lawrance actually with you  And so Sir taking all you say for granted your cousin Montague cannot come to Mrs Sinclair's What pray is her objection to Mrs Sinclair's Is this house fit for me to live in a month or two and not fit for any of your relations for a few daysAnd Mrs Fretchville has taken more time tooAnd so pushing by him I hurried down stairs  He called to Dorcas to bring him his sword and hat and following me down into the passage placed himself between me and the door and again besought me to permit him to attend me  Mrs Sinclair came out at that instant and asked me If I did not choose a dish of chocolate  I wish Mrs Sinclair said I you would take this man in with you to your chocolate I don't know whether I am at liberty to stir out without his leave or notThen turning to him I asked If he kept me there his prisoner  Dorcas just then bringing him his sword and hat he opened the streetdoor and taking my resisting hand led me in a very obsequious manner to the coach People passing by stopt stared and whisper'dBut he is so graceful in his person and dress that he generally takes every eye  I was uneasy to be so gaz'd at and he stepp'd in after me and the coachman drove to St Paul's  He was very full of assiduities all the way while I was as reserv'd as possible And when I return'd din'd as I had done the greatest part of the week by myself  He told me upon my resolving to do so that altho' he would continue his passive observance till I knew the issue of my application yet I must expect that then I should never rest one moment till I had fixed his happy day For that his very soul was fretted with my slights resentments and delays  A wretch when I can say to my infinite regret on a  double  account that all he complains of is owing to himself  O that I may have good tidings from my uncle  Adieu my dearest friendThis shall lie ready for an exchange as I hope for one tomorrow from you that will decide as I may say the destiny of  Your  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER VI Miss  HOWE  To Mrs  JUDITH NORTON    Good Mrs Norton  Thursday May    CANNOT you without naming  me  as an adviser who am hated by the family contrive a way to let Mrs Harlowe know that in an accidental conversation with me you had been assured that my beloved friend pines after a reconciliation with her relations That she has hitherto in hopes of it refused  to enter into any obligations that shall be in the least an hindrance to it That she would fain avoid giving Mr Lovelace a right to make her family uneasy in relation to her grandfather's estate That all she wishes for still is to be indulged in her choice of a single life and on that condition would make her father's pleasure hers with regard to that estate That Mr Lovelace is continually pressing her to marry him and all his friends likewise But that I am sure she has so little liking to the man because of his faulty morals and of her relations antipathy to him that if she had any hope given her of a reconciliation she would forego all thoughts of him and put herself into her father's protection But that their resolution must be speedy for otherwise she would find herself obliged to give way to his pressing intreaties and it might then be out of her power to prevent disagreeable litigations  I do assure you Mrs Norton upon my honour that our dearest friend knows nothing of this procedure of mine And therefore it is proper to acquaint you in confidence with my grounds for itThese are they  She had desired me to let Mr Hickman drop hints to the above effect to her uncle Harlowe but indirectly as from  himself  lest if the application should not be attended with success and Mr Lovelace who already takes it ill that he has so little of her favour come to know it she may be deprived of every protection and be perhaps subjected to great inconveniences from so haughty a spirit  Having this authority from her and being very sollicitous about the success of the application I thought that if the weight of so good a wife mother and sister as Mrs Harlowe is known to be were thrown into the same scale with that of Mr John Harlowe supposing he  could  be engaged it could hardly fail of making a due impression  Mr Hickman will see Mr Harlowe tomorrow By that time you may see Mrs Harlowe If Mr Hickman finds the old gentleman favourable he will tell him that you will have seen Mrs Harlowe upon the same account and will advise him to join in consultation with her how best to proceed to melt the most obdurate hearts in the world  This is the fair state of the matter and my true motive for writing to you I leave all therefore to your discretion And most heartily wish success to it being of opinion that Mr Lovelace cannot possibly deserve our admirable friend Nor indeed know I the man who can  Pray acquaint me by a line of the result of your kind interposition If it prove not such as may be reasonably hoped for our dear friend shall know nothing of this step from me and pray let her not from you For in that case it would only give deeper grief to an heart already too much afflicted I am dear and worthy Mrs Norton  Your true friend  ANNA HOWE  LETTER VII Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  HOWE    Saturday May    Dear Madam  MY heart is almost broken to be obliged to let you know that such is the situation of things in the family of my everdear Miss Harlowe that there can be at present no success expected from any application in her favour Her poor mother is to be pity'd I have a most affecting letter from her but must not communicate it to you and she forbids me to let it be known that she writes upon the subject although she is compelled as it were to do it for the ease of her own heart I mention it therefore in confidence  I hope in God that my beloved Miss has preserved her honour inviolate I hope there is not a man breathing who could attempt a sacrilege so detestable I have no apprehension of a failure in a virtue so established God for ever keep so pure a heart out of the reach of surprizes and violence Ease dear Madam I beseech you my overanxious heart by one line by the bearer altho' but by one line to acquaint me as surely you can that her honour is unsully'd If it be not adieu to all the comforts this life can give Since none will it be able to afford  To the poor  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER VIII Miss  HOWE  To Mrs  JUDITH NORTON    Saturday Evening May    Dear good Woman  YOUR beloved's honour is inviolate  Must  be inviolate And  will  be so in spite of men and devils Could I have had hope of a reconciliation all my view was that she should not have had this manAll that can be said now is She must run the risk of a bad husband She of whom no man living is worthy  You  pity her motherSo don't  I  I pity nobody that puts it out of their power to shew maternal love and humanity in order to patch up for themselves a precarious and sorry quiet which every blast of wind shall disturb  I hate tyrants in every form and shape But paternal and maternal tyrants are the worst of all For they can have no bowels  I repeat that I pity  none  of themMy beloved and your beloved  only  deserves pity She had never been in the hands of this man but for them She is quite blameless You don't know all her story Were I to tell you she had no intention to go off with this man it would avail her nothing It would only  condemn those who drove her to extremities and him who now must be her refuge I am  Your sincere friend and servant  ANNA HOWE  LETTER IX Mrs  HARLOWE  To Mrs  NORTON    Not communicated till the history came to be compiled  Saturday May    I Return an answer in writing as I promised to your communication But take no notice that I do write either to my Bella's Betty who I understand sometimes visits you or to the poor wretch herself nor to anybody I charge you don't My heart is full Writing may give some vent to my griefs and perhaps I may write what lies most upon my heart without confining myself strictly to the present subject  You know how dear this ingrateful creature ever was to us all You know how sincerely we joined with every one of those who ever had seen her or conversed with her to praise and admire her and exceeded in our praise even the bounds of that modesty which because she was our own should have restrained us being of opinion that to have been silent in the praise of so apparent a merit must rather have argued blindness or affectation in us than that we should incur the censure of vain partiality to our own  When therefore anybody congratulated us on such a daughter we received their congratulations without any diminution If it was said You are happy in this child we owned that no parents ever were happier  in  a child If more particularly they praised her dutiful behaviour to us we said She knew not how to offend If it was said Miss Clarissa Harlowe has  a wit and penetration beyond her years we instead of disallowing it would addAnd a judgment no less extraordinary than her wit If her prudence was praised and a forethought which every one saw supply'd what only years and experience gave to others Nobody need to scruple taking lessons from Miss Clarissa Harlowe was our proud answer  Forgive me O forgive me my dear NortonBut I know you willFor yours when good was this child and your glory as well as mine  But have you not heard strangers as she passed to and from church stop to praise the angel of a creature as they called her when it was enough for those who knew who she was to cry  Why it is Miss Clarissa Harlowe  As if everybody were obliged to know or to have heard of Miss Clarissa Harlowe and of her excellencies While accustom'd to praise it was too familiar to her to cause her to alter either her look or her pace  For my own part I could not stifle a pleasure that had perhaps a faulty vanity for its foundation whenever I was spoken of or addressed to as the mother of so sweet a child Mr Harlowe and I all the time loving each other the better for the share each had in such a daughter  Still still indulge the fond the overflowing heart of a mother I could dwell for ever upon the remembrance of what she  was  would but that remembrance banish from my mind what she  is  In her bosom young as she was could I repose all my griefsSure of receiving from  her  prudence advice as well as comfort And both insinuated in so humble in so dutiful a manner that it was impossible to take those exceptions which the distance of years and character between a mother and a daughter would from any other daughter have made one apprehensive of She was our glory when abroad our delight when at home Everybody was even covetous  of her company and we grudg'd her to our brothers Harlowe and to our sister and brother HerveyNo other contention among us then but who should be favoured by her nextNo chiding ever knew she from us but the chiding of lovers when she was for shutting herself up too long together from us in pursuit of those charming amusements and useful employments which however the whole family was the better for  Our other children had reason good children as they always were to think themselves neglected But they likewise were so sensible of their sister's superiority and of the honour she reflected upon the whole family that they confessed themselves eclipsed without envying the eclipser Indeed there was not anybody so equal with her in their own opinions as to envy what all aspired but to emulateThe dear creature you know my Norton gave an eminence to us all And now that she has left us so disgracefully left us we are stript of our ornament and are but a common family  Then her acquirements Her skill in music her fine needleworks her elegance in dress for which she was so much admired that the neighbouring ladies used to say that they need not fetch fashions from London since whatever Miss Clarissa Harlowe wore was the  best  fashion because her choice of  natural  beauties set those of  art  far behind them Her genteel ease and fine turn of person her deep reading and these joined to her open manners and her chearful modestyO my good Norton what a sweet child was  once  my Clary Harlowe  This and more  you  knew her to be For many of her excellencies were owing to yourself and with the milk you gave her you gave her what no other nurse in the world could give her  And do you think my worthy woman do you think that the wilful lapse of such a child is to be  forgiven Can she herself think that she deserves not the severest punishment for the abuse of such talents as were intrusted to her  Her fault was a fault of premeditation of cunning of contrivance She has deceived everybody's expectations Her whole sex as well as the family she sprung from is disgraced by it  Would anybody ever have believed that such a young creature as this who had by her advice saved even her overlively friend from marrying a fop and a libertine would herself have gone off with one of the vilest and most notorious of libertines A man whose character she knew and knew to be worse than his she saved her friend from whose vices she was warned of One who had had her brother's life in his hands and who constantly set our whole family at defiance  Think for me my good Norton think what my unhappiness must be both as a wife and a mother What restless days what sleepless nights yet my own rankling anguish endeavoured to be smoothed over to soften the anguish of fiercer spirits and to keep them from blazing out to further mischief O this naughty naughty girl who  knew  so well what she did and who could look so far into consequences that we thought she would have dy'd rather than have done as she has done  Her known character for prudence leaves no plea for excuse How then can I offer to plead for her if thro' motherly indulgence I would forgive her myselfAnd have we not moreover suffer'd all the disgrace that can befal us Has not she  If  now  she has so little liking to his morals had she not reason  before  to have  as  little Or has she suffered by them in her own personO my good woman I doubtI doubtWill not the character of the man make one doubt an angel if once in his power The world will think the worst I am told  it  does  So likewise her father fears her brother hears and what can I do  Our  antipathy  to him she knew before as well as his character These therefore cannot be new motives without a new reasonO my dear Mrs Norton how shall  I  how can  you  support ourselves under the apprehensions that these thoughts lead to of my Clary Harlowe and your Clary Harlowe  He continually pressing her  you say  to marry him His friends likewise  She has reason no doubt she has reason for this application to us And her crime is gloss'd over to bring her to us with new disgraceWhither whither does one guilty step lead the misguided heartAnd now truly to save a stubborn spirit we are only to be  sounded  that the application may be retracted or deny'd  Upon the whole Were I inclined to plead for her it is  now  the most improper of all times  Now  that my brother Harlowe has discouraged as he last night came hither on purpose to tell us Mr Hickman's insinuated application and been applauded for it  Now  that my brother Antony is intending to carry his great fortune thro' her fault into another familyShe expecting no doubt herself to be put into her grandfather's estate in consequence of a reconciliation and as a reward for her fault And insisting still upon terms that she offer'd before and were rejectedNot thro' my fault I am sure rejected  From all these things you will return such an answer as the case requiresIt might cost me the peace of my whole life at this time to move for her God forgive herIf I do nobody else will And let it be for your own sake as well as mine a secret that you and I have enter'd upon this subject And I desire you not to touch upon it again but by particular permission For O my dear good woman it sets my heart ableeding in as many streams as there are veins in it  Yet think me not impenetrable by a proper contrition and remorse But what a torment is it to have a will without a power  Adieu adieu God give us both comfort and to the once dearthe everdear creature for can a mother forget her child repentance deep repentance And as little suffering as may befit his blessed will and her grievous fault prays  Your real friend  CHARLOTTE HARLOWE  LETTER X Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sunday May    HOW it is now my dear between you and Mr Lovelace I cannot tell But wicked as the man is I am afraid he must be your lord and master  I called him by several very hard names in my last I had but just heard some of his vilenesses when I sat down to write so my indignation was raised But on inquiry and recollection I find that the facts laid to his charge were all of them committed some time ago not since he has had  strong  hopes of your favour This is saying something for him His generous behaviour to the innkeeper's daughter is a more recent instance to his credit to say nothing of the universal good character he has as a kind landlord And then I approve much of the motion he made to put you in possession of Mrs Fretchville's house while he continues at the other widow's till you agree that one house shall hold you I wish this was done Be sure you embrace this offer if you do not soon meet at the altar and get one of his cousins with you  Were you once marry'd I should think you cannot be  very  unhappy tho' you n  not be so happy with him as you deserve to be  stake he has in  his country and his reversions The care he takes of his affairs his freedom from obligation nay his pride with your merit must be a tolerable security for you I should think Tho' particulars of his wickedness as they come to my knowlege hurt and incense me yet after all when I give myself time to reflect all that I have heard of him to his disadvantage was comprehended in the general character given of him long ago by his uncle's and his own dismiss'd bailiff  Vol  I  p    and which was confirm'd to you by Mrs Greme  Vol  III  p      You can have nothing therefore I think to be deeply concerned about but his future good and the bad example he may hereafter set to his own family These indeed are very just concerns But were you to  leave  him now either  with  or  without  his consent his fortune and alliances so considerable his person and address so engaging everyone excusing you now on those accounts and because of your relations follies it would have a very ill appearance for your reputation I cannot therefore on the most deliberate consideration advise you to think of that while you have no reason to doubt his honour May eternal vengeance pursue the villain if he gives room for an apprehension of this nature  Yet his teazing ways are intolerable His acquiescence with your slight delays and his resignedness to the distance you now keep him at for a fault so much slighter as he must think than the punishment are unaccountable He doubts your love of  him  that is very probable but you have reason to be surprised at  his  want of ardour a blessing so great within his  reach  as I may say  By the time you have read to this place you will have no doubt of what has been the issue of the conference between the  Two Gentlemen  I am equally shock'd and enraged against them All Against them  All  I say for I have try'd your good Norton's weight with your mother to the same purpose as the gentleman sounded your uncleNever were there such determin'd brutes in the world Why should I mince the matter Yet would I fain methinks make an exception for your mother  Your uncle will have it that you are ruin'd  'He can believe everything bad of a creature who could run away with a manWith such a one especially as Lovelace They all  expected  applications from you when some heavy distress had fallen upon youBut they were all resolved not to stir an inch in your favour no not to save your life'  My dearest soul resolve to assert your right Claim your own and go and live upon it as you ought Then if you marry not how will the wretches creep to you for your reversionary dispositions  You were accused as in your aunt's letter  'of premeditation and contrivance in your escape'  Instead of pitying  you  the mediating person was called upon  'to pity  them  who once he said doted upon you Who took no joy but in your presence Who devour'd your words as you spoke them Who trod over again your footsteps as you walked before them'  And I know not what of this sort  Upon the whole it is now evident to me and so it must be to you when you read this letter that you have but one choice And the sooner you make it the betterShall we suppose that it is not in your power to make itI cannot have patience to suppose that  I am concern'd methinks to know how you will do to condescend now you see you must be his after you have kept him at such a distance and for the revenge his pride may put him upon taking for it But let me tell you that if my going up and shareing fortunes with you will prevent such a noble creature from stooping too low much more were it  likely to prevent your ruin I would not hesitate a moment about it What's the whole world to me weigh'd against such a friendship as oursThink you that any of the enjoyments of this life could be enjoyments to me were such a friend as you to be involved in calamities which I could either relieve her from or alleviate by giving them up And what in saying this and acting up to it do I offer you but the fruits of a friendship your worth has created  Excuse my warmth of expression The warmth of my heart wants none I am enraged at your relations for bad as what I have mentioned is I have not told you all nor now perhaps ever willI am angry at my own mother's narrowness of mind and adherence to old notions indiscriminatelyAnd I am exasperated against your foolish your lowvanity'd LovelaceBut let us stoop to take the wretch as he is and make the best of him since you are destin'd to stoop to keep grovelers and worldlings in countenance He has not been guilty of direct indecency to you Nor  dare  he Not so much of a devil as that comes to neitherHad he such villainous intentions so much in his power as you are they would have shewn themselves before now to such a penetrating and vigilant eye and to such a pure heart as yours Let us save the wretch then if we can tho' we soil our fingers in lifting him up from his dirt  There is yet to a person of your fortune and independence a good deal to do if you enter upon those terms which  ought  to be enter'd upon I don't find that he has once talked of settlements much less of the licence It is hard But as your evil destiny has thrown you out of all other protection and medi  tion you must be father mother uncle to yourself and enter upon the requisite points for yourself Indeed you must Your situation requires it What room for delicacy now Or would you have  me  write to the wretch Yet that would be the same thing as if you were to write yourself Yet write you should I think if you cannot speak But speaking is certainly best For words leave no traces they pass as breath and mingle with air and may be explained with latitude But the pen is a witness on record  I know the gentleness of your spirit I know the laudable pride of your heart and the just notion you have of the dignity of our sex in these delicate points But once more all this is nothing now Your honour is concerned that the dignity I speak of should not be stood upon  'Mr Lovelace' would I say yet hate the foolish fellow for his low his stupid pride in wishing to triumph over the dignity of his own wife 'I am deprived by your means of every friend I have in the world In what light am I to look upon  you  I have well consider'd of every thing You have made some people much against my liking think me a  wife  Others know I am  not  married nor do I desire any body should believe I  am  Do you think your being here in the same house with me can be to my reputation You talk to me of Mrs Fretchville's house" This will bring him to renew his last discourse on that subject if he does not revive it of himself 'If Mrs Fretchville knows not her own mind what is her house to me You talked of bringing up your cousin Montague to bear me company If my brother's schemes be your pretence for not going yourself to  fetch her  you can  write  to herI insist upon bringing these two points to an issue Off or on ought to be indifferent to  me  if so to  them  '  Such a declaration must bring all forward There are twenty ways my dear that you would find out to advise another how to act in your circumstances He will disdain from his native insolence to have it thought he  has  anybody  to consult Well then will he not be obliged to declare himself And if he  does  no delays on your side I beseech you Give him the day Let it be a short one It would be derogating from your own merit and  honour  too let me tell you even altho' he should  not  be so explicit as he ought to be to seem but to doubt his meaning and to wait for that explanation which I should for ever despise him for if he makes necessary Twice already have you my dear if not oftener  modesty'd  away such opportunities as you ought not to have sliptAs to settlements if they come not in naturally e'en leave them to his own justice and to the justice of his family And there's an end of the matter  This is  my  advice Mend it as circumstances offer and follow  your own  But indeed my dear this or something like it would I do As witness  Your  ANNA HOWE  Inclosed in the above  I Must trouble you with my concerns tho' your own are so heavy upon youA piece of news I have to tell you Your uncle Antony is disposed to marryWith whom think youWith my mamma True indeed Your family know it All is laid with redoubled malice at your door And there the  old soul  himself lays it  Take no notice of this intelligence not so much as in your letters to me for fear of accidents  I think it can't do But were I to provoke my mother that might afford a pretence Else I should have been with you before now I fancy  The first likelihood that appears to me of encouragement I dismiss Hickman that's certain If my mother disoblige me in so important an article I shan't think of obliging her in such another It is impossible surely that the desire of popping me off to that honest man can be with such a view  I repeat that it cannot come to any thing But these  widows  Then such a love in us all both old and young of being courted and admiredAnd so irresistible to their  elderships  to be flatter'd that all power is not over with them but that they may still class and prank it with their daughters It vexed me heartily to have her tell me of this proposal with selfcomplaisant simperings and yet she affected to speak of it as if she had no intention to encourage it  These antiquated batchelors old before they think themselves so imagine that when they have once persuaded  themselves  they have nothing else to do but to make their minds known to the lady His overgrown fortune is indeed a baita tempting one A saucy daughter to be got rid of The memory of the father of that daughter not precious enough to weighBut let him advance if he dareLet her encourageBut I hope she won't  Excuse me my dear I am nettled They have fearfully rumpled my gorget You'll think me faulty So I won't put my name to this separate paper Other hands may resemble mine You did not see me write it  LETTER XI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Monday P M May    NOW indeed is it evident my best my only friend that I have but one choice to make And now do I find that I have carried my resentment against this man too far since now I am to appear as if under an obligation to his patience with me for a conduct that perhaps he will think if not humoursome and childish plainly demonstrative of my little esteem of him of but a secondary esteem at least where before his pride rather than  his merit had made him expect a  first  O my dearto be under obligation to and to be cast upon a man that is not a  generous  manThat is indeed a  cruel  manThat is capable of creating a distress to a young creature who by her evil destiny is thrown into his power and then of  enjoying  it as I may say I verily think I may say so of this savageWhat a fate is mine  You give me my dear good advice as to the peremptory manner in which I ought to treat him But do you consider to whom it is that you give that advice  The occasion for it should never have been given by  me  of all creatures for I am unequal utterly unequal to itWhat  I  to challenge a man for a husband  I  to exert myself to quicken the delayer in his resolutions And having lost an opportunity to begin to try to recal it as  from myself  and  for myself  To  threaten  him as I may say into the marriagestateO my dear if this be right to be done how difficult is it where Modesty and Self or where Pride if you please is concerned to do that right Or to express myself in your words to be father mother uncle to myselfEspecially where one thinks a triumph over one is intendedDo my dear advise me persuade me to renounce the man for ever And then I will for ever renounce him  You say you have tried Mrs Norton's weight with my mammaBad as the returns are which my application by Mr Hickman has met with you tell me you have not acquainted me with all the bad nor now perhaps ever will But why so my dear What  is  the bad what  can  be the bad which now you will never tell me ofWhat worse than renounce me and for ever  'My uncle you say believes me ruin'd He declares that he can believe every thing bad of a creature who could run away with a man  And they have all made a resolution not to stir an inch in my favour no not to save my life"  Have you worse than this my dear behindSurely my father has not renewed his dreadful maledictionSurely if so my mamma has not joined in it Have my uncles given it their sanction and made it a family act What my dear is the worst that you will leave for ever unrevealed  O Lovelace why comest thou not just now while these black prospects are before me For now couldst thou look into my heart wouldst thou see a distress worthy of thy barbarous triumph  I WAS forced to quit my pen  And you say you have try'd Mrs Norton's weight with my mamma  What  is  done cannot be help'd But I wish you had not taken any step in a matter so very concerning to me without first consulting meForgive me my dearbut that highsoul'd and noble friendship which you avow with so obliging and so uncommon a warmth at the same time that it is the subject of my grateful admiration is no less because of its fervor the ground of my apprehension  Well but now to look forward you are of opinion that I must be his And that I cannot leave him with reputation to myself whether with or without his consent I must if so make the best of the bad matter  He went out in the morning intending not to return to dinner unless as he sent me word I would admit him to dine with me  I excused myself The man whose anger is now to be of such high importance to me was it seems displeased  As he as well as I expected that I should receive a letter from you this day by Collins I suppose he will not be long before he returns and then possibly  he is to be mighty stately mighty  mannis  mighty  coy  if you please And then must I be very humble very submissive and try to whine myself into his good graces With downcast eye if not by speech beg his forgivenness for the distance I have so perversely kept him atYes I warrant youBut I'll see how this behaviour will sit upon meYou have always railly'd me upon my meekness I think Well then I'll try if I can be still meeker shall IO my dear  But let me sit with my hands before me all patience all resignation for I think I hear him coming upOr shall I roundly accost him in the words in the form you my dear have prescrib'd  He is come inHe has sent to me all impatience in his aspect Dorcas saysBut I cannot cannot see him  Monday Night  THE contents of your letter and my own heavy reflections render'd me incapable of seeing this expecting manThe first word he asked Dorcas was If I had received a letter since he had been outShe told me this and her answer That I had and was fasting and had been in tears ever since  He sent to desire an interview with me  I answer'd by her That I was not very well In the morning if better I would see him as soon as he pleased  Very humble was it not my dearYet he was too royal to take it for humility for Dorcas told me he rubb'd one side of his face imp  tiently and said a rash word and was out of humour stalking about the room  Half an hour after he sent again desiring very earnestly that I would admit him to supper with me He would enter upon no subjects of conversation but what I should lead to  So I should have been at  liberty  you see to  court him  I again desired to be excused  Indeed my dear my eyes were swelled I was very lowspirited and could not think of entering all at once after several days distance into the freedom of conversation which my friends utter rejection of me as well as your opinion have made necessary  He sent up to tell me that as he heard I was fasting if I would promise to eat some chicken which Mrs Sinclair had order'd for supper he would acquiesceVery kind in his angerIs he not  I promised him Can I be more  preparatively  condescendingHow happy I'll warrant you if I may meet him in a kind and forgiving humour  I hate myselfBut I won't be insulted Indeed I won't for all this  LETTER XII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday May    I Think once more we seem to be in a kind of train but through a storm I will give you the particulars  I heard him in the diningroom at five in the morning I had rested very ill and was up too But opened not my door till six When Dorcas brought me his request for my company  He approached me and taking my hand as I enter'd the diningroom I went not to bed Madam till two yet slept not a wink For God's sake torment me not as you have done for a week past  He paus'd I was silent  At first proceeded he I thought your resentment of a mere unavailing curiosity could not be deep  and that it would go off of itself But when I found it was to be kept up till you knew the success of some new overtures which you had made and which comply'd with might have deprived me of you for ever how Madam could I support myself under the thoughts of having with such an union of interests made so little impression upon your mind in my favour  He paus'd again I was still silent He went on  I acknowlege that I have a proud heart Madam I cannot but hope for some instance of previous and preferable favour from the lady I am ambitious to call mine and that her choice of me should not appear not  flagrantly  appear directed by the perverseness of her selfish persecutors and my irreconcileable enemies  More to the same purpose he said You know my dear the room he had given me to recriminate upon him in twenty instances I did not spare him But I need not repeat those instances to you Every one of these instances I told him convinced me of his  pride  indeed but not of his  merit  I confessed that I had as much pride as himself altho' I hoped it was of another kind than that he so readily avowed But that if he had the least mixture in  his  of the true pride a pride worthy of his birth of his family and of his fortune he should rather wish I would presume to say to promote  mine  than either to suppress or to regret that I had it That  hence  it was that I thought it beneath me to disown what had been my motives for declining for some days past any conversation with him or visit from Mr Mennell that might lead to points out of my power to determine upon until I heard from my uncle Harlowe whom I confessed I had caused to be sounded whether  might be favoured with his interest to obtain for me a reconciliation with my friends upon terms which I had caused to be proposed to him  He knew not he said and supposed must not presume to ask what these terms were But he could but too well guess at them and that he was to have been the preliminary sacrifice But I must allow him to say That as much as he admired the nobleness of my sentiments in general and in particular that  true  pride in me which I had spoken of he wish'd that he could compliment me with such an uniformity in it as should have set me as much above all submission to minds implacable and unreasonable he hoped he might without offence say that my brother's and sister's were such as it had above all favour and condescension to him  Duty  and  nature  Sir call upon me to make the submissions you speak of There is a father there is a mother there are uncles in the one case to justify and demand those submissionsWhat pray Sir can be pleaded for the  condescension  as you call itWill you say your merits either with regard to  them  or to  myself  may  This to be said after the persecution of those relations After what you have suffer'd After what you have made me hope Let me ask you Madam we talk'd of  pride  just now What sort of pride must  his  be which could dispense with inclination and preference in his lady's part of itWhat must be that love  Love  Sir who talks of  love  Was not  merit  the thing we were talking ofHave  I  ever professed have  I  ever required of  you  professions of a passion of that nature But there is no end of these debatings each  so  faultless each  so  full of self  I do not think myself  faultless  MadamBut  But  what SirWould you evermore argue with me as if you were a childSeeking palliations and making promisesPromises of what Sir Of being in future the man it is a shame a gentleman is notOf being the man  Good God interrupted he with eyes lifted up if  thou  wert to be thus severe  Well well Sir impatientlyI need only to observe that all this vast difference in sentiments shews how unpair'd our minds areSo let us  Let us  what  MadamMy soul is rising into tumults And he look'd so wildly that it startled me a good dealLet us  what  Madam  Why Sir let us resolve to quit every regard for each otherNay flame not outI am a poor weakminded creature in some things But where what I  should be  or not deserve to live if I  am not  is in the question I have great and invincible spirit or my own conceit betrays meLet us resolve to quit every regard for each other that is more than civil  This  you may depend upon you may if it will fewel your pride gratify it with this assurance That I will never marry any other man I have seen enough of your sex at least of  you  A single life shall ever be  my  choiceWhile I will leave you at liberty to pursue  your own    Indifference worse than indifference said he in a passion  Interrupting himIndifference let it beYou have not in  my  opinion at least deserved it should be other If you have in  your own  you have cause at least your  pride  has to hate me for misjudging you  Dearest dearest creature snatching my hand with wildness let me beseech you to be  uniformly  noble  Civil regards  Madam  Civil regards  Can you so expect to narrow and confine such a passion as mine  Such a passion as yours Mr Lovelace  deserves  to be narrow'd and confin'dIt is either the passion  you  do not think it or  I  do notI question whether your mind is capable of being  so  narrow'd and  so  widen'd as is necessary to make it be what I wish  it to be Lift up your hands and your eyes Sir in that emphatical silent wonder as you please But what does it express what does it convince me of but that we are not born for one another  By his soul he said and grasp'd my hand with an eagerness that hurt it we  were  born for one another I  must  be hisI  should  be his and put his other arm round me altho' his damnation were to be the purchase  I was terrify'dLet me leave youor begone from me SirIs the passion you boast to be thus shockingly declared  You must not go MadamYou must  not  leave me in anger  I will returnI will returnWhen you can be less violentless shocking  And he let me go  The man quite frighted me insomuch that when I got into my chamber I found a sudden flow of tears a great relief to me  In half an hour he sent a little billet expressing his concern for the vehemence of his behaviour and praying to see me  I wentBecause I could not help myself I went  He was full of his excusesO my dear what would you even  you  do with such a man as this and in my situation  It was very possible for him now he said to account for the workings of a frenzical disorder For his part he was near distraction All last week to suffer as he had suffer'd and now to talk of  civil regards  only when he had hoped from the nobleness of my mind  Hope what you will interrupted I I must insist upon it that our minds are by no means suited to each other You have brought me into difficulties I am deserted of every friend but Miss Howe My  true sentiments I will not conceal It is against my will that I must submit to owe protection from a brother's projects which Miss Howe thinks are not given over to you who have brought me into these streights  not  with my own concurrence brought me into them remember that  I do remember that Madam So often reminded how can I forget it  Yet I  will  owe to you this protection if it be necessary in the earnest hope that you will  shun  rather than  seek  mischief if any further inquiry after me be made But what hinders you from leaving meCannot I send to you The Widow Fretchville it is plain knows not her own mind The people here indeed are civiller every day than other But I had rather have lodgings more agreeable to my circumstances I best know what will suit them and am resolved not to be obliged to any body If you leave me I will take a civil leave of these people and retire to some one of the neighbouring villages and there secreting myself wait my cousin Morden's arrival with patience  He presumed he told me from what I said that my application to my relations was unsuccessful That therefore he hoped I would give him leave now to mention the terms in the nature of settlements which he had long intended to propose to me and which having till now delay'd to do thro' accidents not proceeding from himself he had thoughts of urging to me the moment I enter'd upon my new house and upon finding myself as independent in  appearance  as I was in  fact  Permit me Madam to propose these matters to youNot with an expectation of your immediate answer but for your consideration  Were not hesitation a selffelt glow a downcast eye more than enough Your advice was too much in my head I hesitated  He urg'd on upon my silence He would call God to witness to the justice nay to the  generosity  of his intentions to me if I would be so good as to hear what he had to propose to me as to settlements  Could not the man have fallen into the subject without this  parade  Many a point you know  is  refused and  ought to be  refused if leave be asked to introduce it and when once refused the refusal must in honour be adhered toWhereas had it been  slid  in upon one as I may say it might have merited further consideration If such a man as he knows not this who should  I thought myself obliged tho' not to depart from this subject intirely yet to give it a more diffuse turn in order on the one hand to save myself the mortification of appearing too ready in my compliance after such a distance as had been between us and on the other to avoid in pursuance of your advice the necessity of giving him such a repulse as might again throw us out of the course  A cruel alternative to be reduced to  You talk of  generosity  Mr Lovelace said I and you talk of  justice  perhaps without having consider'd the force of the words in the sense you use them on this occasionLet me tell you what  generosity  is in my sense of the wordTRUE GENEROSITY is not confined to pecuniary instances It is  more  than politeness It is  more  than good faith It is  more  than honour It is  more  than  justice  Since all these are but duties and what a worthy mind cannot dispense with But TRUE GENEROSITY is greatness of soul It incites us to do more by a fellowcreature than can be strictly required of us It obliges us to hasten to the relief of an object that wants relief anticipating even hope or expectation Generosity Sir will not surely permit a worthy mind to doubt of its honourable and beneficent intentions Much less will it allow itself to shock to offend any one and least of all a person  thrown by adversity mishap or accident into its protection  What an opportunity had he to clear his intentions had he been so disposed from the  latter part  of this home observationBut he run away with the  first  and kept to that  Admirably defin'd he saidBut who at this rate Madam can be said to be  generous  to youYour  generosity  I implore while  justice  as it must be my sole merit shall be my aim Never was there a woman of such nice and delicate sentiments  It is a reflection upon yourself Sir and upon the company you have kept if you think these notions either nice or delicate Thousands of my sex are more nice than I for they would have avoided the devious path I have been surprized into The consequences of which surprize have laid me under the sad necessity of telling a man who has not delicacy enough to enter into those parts of the female character which are its glory and distinction what True Generosity is  His divine monitress he called meHe would endeavour to form his manners as he had often promised by my example But he hoped I would now permit him to mention briefly the  justice  he proposed to do me in the terms of the settlement a subject so proper before now to have been enter'd upon and which would have been enter'd upon long ago had not my frequent displeasure taken from him the opportunity he had often wish'd for But now having ventur'd to lay hold of this nothing should divert him from improving it  I have no spirits just now Sir to attend to such weighty points What you have a mind to propose write to me And I shall know what answer to return Only one thing let me remind you of that if you touch upon any subject in which my papa has  a concern I shall judge by your treatment of the father what value you have for the daughter  He  looked  as if he would choose rather to speak than write But had he  said  so I had a severe return to have made upon him as possibly he might see by  my  looks  IN this way are we now A sort of calm as I said succeeding a stormWhat may happen next whether a storm or a calm with such a spirit as I have to deal with who can tell  But be that as it will I think my dear I am not  meanly  off And that is a great point with me and which I know you'll be glad to hear If it were only that I can see this man without losing any of that dignity what other word can I use speaking of  myself  that betokens  decency  and not  arrogance  which is so necessary to enable me to look  up  or rather with the  mind's  eye I may say to look  down  upon a man of this man's cast  Altho' circumstances have so offer'd that I could not take your advice as to the  manner  of dealing with him yet you gave me so much courage by it as has enabled me to conduct things to this issue as well as determin'd me against leaving him Which  before  I was thinking to do at all adventures Whether when it came to the point I  should  have done so or not I cannot say because it would have depended upon his behaviour at the time  But let his behaviour be what it will I am afraid with you that should any thing offer at last to oblige me to leave him I shall not mend my situation in the world's eye but the contrary And yet I will not be treated by him with indignity while I have any power to help myself  You my dear have accused me of having  modesty'daway  as you phrase it several opportunities of beingBeing what my dearWhy the wife of a libertine  And what a libertine and his wife are my cousin Morden's letter tells usLet me here once for all endeavour to account for the motives of my behaviour to this man and for the principles I have proceeded upon as they appear to me upon a close selfexamination  Be pleased then to allow me to think that my motives on this occasion arise not  altogether  from maidenly niceness nor yet from the apprehension of what my present tormentor and future husband may think of a precipitate compliance on such a disagreeable behaviour as his But they arise principally from what offers to my own heart respecting as I may say its own rectitude its own judgment of the  fit  and the  unfit  as I would without study answer  for  myself  to  myself in the  first  place to  him  and to the  world  in the  second  only Principles that  are  in my mind that I  found  there implanted no doubt by the first gracious Planter Which therefore  impell  me as I may say to act up to them that thereby I may to the best of my judgment be enabled to comport myself worthily in both states the single and the married let others act as they will by  me    I hope my dear I do not deceive myself and instead of setting about rectifying what is amiss in my heart endeavour to find excuses for habits and peculiarities which I am unwilling to cast off or overcome The heart is very deceitful Do you my dear friend lay mine open but surely it is always open before you and spare me not if you find or think it culpable  This observation once for all as I said I thought proper to make to convince you that to the best of my judgment my errors in matters as well of the lesser moment as the greater shall rather be the fault of my understanding than of my will  I am my dearest friend  Your everobliged  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday Night May    MR Lovelace has sent me by Dorcas his proposals as follow  'To spare a delicacy so extreme and to obey you I write And the rather that you may communicate this paper to Miss Howe who may consult any of her friends you shall think proper to have intrusted on this occasion I say  intrusted  because as you know I have given it out to several persons that we are actually marry'd'  'In the first place Madam I offer to settle upon you by way of jointure your whole estate And moreover to vest in trustees such a part of mine in Lancashire as shall produce a clear four hundred pounds a year to be paid to your sole and separate use quarterly'  'My own estate is a clear  l per annum  Lord M proposes to give me possession either of That which he has in Lancashire to which by the way I think I have a better title than he has himself or That we call  The Lawn  in Hertfordshire upon my nuptials with a lady whom he so greatly admires and to make that I shall choose a clear  l per annum  '  'My too great contempt of censure has subjected me to much traduction It may not therefore be improper to assure you on the word of a gentleman that no part of my estate was ever mortgaged And that altho' I lived very expensively abroad and made large draughts yet that MidsummerDay next will discharge all that I owe in the world My notions are not all bad ones I have been thought in pecuniary cases  generous  It would have deserved  another  name had I not first been  just  '  'If as your own estate is at present in your father's hands you rather choose that I should make a jointure out of mine tantamount to yours be it what it will it shall be done I will engage Lord M to write to  you  what he proposes to do on the happy occasion Not as your desire or expectation but to demonstrate that no advantage is intended to be taken of the situation you are in with your own family'  'To shew the beloved daughter the consideration I have for her I will consent that she shall prescribe the terms of agreement in relation to the large sums which must be in her father's hands arising from her grandfather's estate I have no doubt but he will be put upon making large demands upon you All those it shall be in your power to comply with for the sake of your own peace And the remainder shall be paid into your hands and be intirely at your disposal as a fund to support those charitable donations which I have heard you so famed for  out  of your family and for which you have been so greatly reflected upon  in  it'  'As to cloaths jewels and the like against the time you shall choose to make your appearance it will be my pride that you shall not be beholden for such of these as shall be answerable to the rank of both to those who have had the stupid folly to renounce a daughter they deserved not You must excuse me Madam You would mistrust my sincerity in the rest could I speak of these people with less asperity tho' so nearly related to you'  'These Madam are my proposals They are such as I always designed to make whenever you would permit me to enter into the delightful subject But you have been so determin'd to try every method for reconciling yourself to your relations even by giving me absolutely up for ever that yo  have seem'd to think it but justice to keep me at  distance till the event of that your  predominant  hope could be seen It is  now  seenAnd altho' I  have been  and perhaps still  am  ready to regret the want of that preference I wish'd for from you as Miss Clarissa Harlowe yet I am sure as the husband of Mrs Lovelace I shall be more ready to adore than to blame you for the pangs you have given to a heart the generosity or rather  justice  of which my implacable enemies have taught you to doubt And this still the readier as I am persuaded that those pangs never would have been given by a mind so noble had not the doubt been entertained perhaps with too great an appearance of reason and as I hope I shall have it to reflect that the moment the doubt shall be overcome the indifference will cease'  'I will only add that if I have omitted any thing that would have given you further satisfaction or if the above terms be short of what you would wish you will be pleased to supply them as you think fit And when I know your pleasure I will instantly order articles to be drawn up conformably that nothing in my power may be wanting to make you happy'  'You will now dearest Madam judge how far all the rest depends upon yourself'  YOU see my dear what he offers You see it is all my fault that he has not made these offers beforeI am a strange creature To be to blame in everything and to everybody Yet neither intend the ill at the time nor know it to  be  the ill till too late or so nearly too late that I must give up all the delicacy he talks of to compound for my fault  I shall now judge how far all the rest depends upon myself  So coldly concludes he such warm and in the main unobjectible proposals Would you not as you read have supposed that the paper would conclude with the most earnest demand of a dayI  own I had that expectation so strong resulting  naturally  as I may say from the premises that without studying for dissatisfaction I could not help being dissatisfied when I came to the conclusionBut you say there is no help I must perhaps make  further  sacrifices All delicacy it seems is to be at an end with me But if so this man knows not what every  wise  man knows that prudence and virtue and delicacy of mind in a  wife  do the husband more  real  honour in the eye of the world than the same qualities were  she  destitute of them in  himself  As the  want  of them in her does him more  dis  honour For are not the wife's errors the husband's reproach How  justly  his reproach is another thing  I will consider this paper and write to it if I am able For it seems  now all the rest depends upon myself    LETTER XIV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wednesday Morning May    MR Lovelace would fain have engag'd me last night But as I was not prepar'd to enter upon the subject of his proposals intending to consider them maturely and was not highly pleased with his conclusion and then there is hardly any getting from him in tolerable time overnight I desired to be excused seeing him till morning  About seven o'clock we met in the diningroom I find he was full of expectation that I should meet him with a very favourable who knows but with a  thankful  aspectAnd I immediately found by his sullen countenance that he was under no small disapp  intment that I did not  My dearest love are you wellWhy look you so solemn upon meWill your indifference never  be overIf I have proposed terms in any respect  short  of your expectation  I told him that he had very considerately mention'd my shewing his proposals to Miss Howe and consulting any of her friends upon them by her means and I should have an opportunity to send them to her by Collins byandby and so insisted to suspend any talk upon that subject till I had her opinion upon them  Good GodIf there were but the least loophole the least room for delayBut he was writing a letter to his uncle to give him an account of his situation with me and could not finish it so satisfactorily either to my Lord or to himself as if I would condescend to say whether the terms he had proposed were acceptable or not  Thus far I told him I could say That my principal point was peace and reconciliation with my family As to other matters the genteelness of his own spirit would put him upon doing more for me than I should ask or expect Wherefore if all he had to write about was to know what Lord M would do on my account he might spare himself the trouble for that my utmost wishes as to myself were much more easily gratify'd than he perhaps imagin'd  He asked me then If I would so far permit him to touch upon the happy day as to request his uncle's presence on the occasion and to be my father  Father  had a sweet and venerable sound with it I said I should be glad to have a father who would own me  Was not this plain speaking think you my dear Yet it rather I must own appears so to me on reflection than was  designed  freely at the time For I then with a sigh from the bottom of my heart thought of my  own father  bitterly regretting that I am an outcast from him and from my mother  Mr Lovelace I thought seemed a little affected at  the  manner  of my speaking as well as at the sad reflection I suppose  I am but a very young creature Mr Lovelace said I and wiped my averted eye altho' you have  kindly  and in  love to me  introduced so much sorrow to me already So you must not wonder that the word  father  strikes so sensibly upon the heart of a child ever dutiful till she knew you and whose tender years still require the paternal wing  He turned towards the window Rejoice with me my dear since I seem devoted to him that the man is not absolutely impenetrableHis emotion was visible yet he endeavoured to suppress itApproaching me again again he was obliged to turn from me Angelic something he said But then obtaining a heart more  suitable  to his wish he once more approached meFor his own part he said as Lord M was so subject to the gout he was afraid that the compliment he had just proposed to make him might if made occasion a longer suspension than he could bear to think of And if it did it would vex him to the heart that he had made it  I could not say a single word to this you know my dear But you will guess at my thoughts of what h  saidSo much passionate love  lipdeep  So prudent and so dutifully patient  at heart  to a relation he had till now so undutifully despisedWhy why a  I thrown upon such a man thought I  He hesitated as if contending with himself an after taking a turn or two about the roomHe w  at a great loss what to determine upon he said be+cause he had not the honour of knowing when he w  to be made the happiest of menWould to God might that very instant be resolved upon  He stopp'd a moment or two staring in my dow  cast face Did I not O my beloved friend thi  you want a father or a mother just then But he could not so  soon  as he wished procure my co  +sent  to a day in  that  case he thought the compliment might  as well  be made to Lord M as  not  Since the settlements might be drawn and ingrossed in the intervenient time which would pacify his impatience as no time would be lost  You will suppose how  I  was affected by this speech by repeating the substance of what  he  said upon it as follows  But by his soul he knew not so much was I upon the reserve and so much latent meaning did my eye import whether when he most hoped to please me he was not farthest from doing so Would I vouchsafe to say Whether I approved of his compliment to Lord M or not  Miss Howe thought I at that moment says I must  not  run away from This man  To be sure Mr Lovelace if this matter is  ever to be  it must be agreeable to me to have the full approbation of  one  side since I cannot have that of the  other    If this matter be ever to be  Good God what words were those at this time of day And full  approbation  of one side Why that word  approbation  When the greatest pride of all his family was That of having the honour of so dear a creature for their relation Would to Heaven my dearest life added he that without complimenting  Any  body tomorrow might be the happiest day of my lifeWhat say you my angel With a trembling impatience that  seemed  not affectedWhat say you for  tomorrow  It was likely my dear I could say much to it or name another day had I been disposed to the latter with such an hinted delay from him  Next  day Madam if not  tomorrow  Or the  day after that  And taking my two hands stared me into a halfconfusion  No no You cannot think all of a sudden there  should be reason for such a hurry It will be most agreeable to be sure for my Lord to be present  I am all obedience and resignation returned the wretch with a selfpluming air as if he had acquiesced to a proposal made by me and had complimented me with a great piece of selfdenial  Modesty I think required it of me that it should pass so Did it notI think it did Would to HeavenBut what signifies wishing  But when he would have  rewarded himself  as he had heretofore called it for this selfsupposed concession with a kiss I repulsed him with a just and very sincere disdain  He seemed both vex'd and surpriz'd as one who had made proposals that he had expected every thing from He plainly said that he thought our situation would intitle him to such an innocent freedom And he was both amaz'd and griev'd to be thus scornfully repulsed  No reply could be made by me I abruptly broke from him I recollect as I passed by one of the pierglasses that I saw in it his clenched hand offered in wrath to his forehead The words  indifference by his soul next to hatred  I heard him speak And something of  ice  he mentioned I heard not what  Whether he intends to write to my Lord or to Miss Montague I cannot tell But as all delicacy ought to be over with me  now  perhaps I am to blame to expect it from a man who may not know  what it is  If he does  not  and yet thinks himself very delicate and intends not to be otherwise I am rather to be pitied than he to be censured And after all since I  must  take him as I find him I  must  That is to say as a man so vain and so accustom'd to be admired that not being conscious of internal defect he has taken no pains to polish more than his outside And as his proposals are higher than my expectations and as in his own opinion he has a great deal to bear from  me  I  will  no new offence preventing sit down to answer themAnd if possible in terms as unobjectible to him as his are to me  But after all see you not my dear more and more the mismatch that there is in our minds  However I am willing to compound for my fault by giving up if that may be all my punishment the expectation of what is deemed happiness in this life with such a husband as I fear he will make In short I will content myself to be a suffering person thro' the state to the end of my life A long one it cannot be  This may qualify him as it may prove from stings of conscience from misbehaviour to a  first  wife to be a more tolerable one to a  second  tho' not perhaps better deserving While my story to all who shall know it will afford these instructions That the eye is a traitor and ought ever to be mistrusted That form is deceitful In other words That a fine person is seldom pair'd by a fine mind And that sound principles and a good heart are the only bases on which the hopes of a  happy future  either with respect to the  here  or to the  hereafter  can be built  And so much at present for Mr Lovelace's proposals Of which I desire your opinion  I am my dearest fri  nd  Your everobliged  CL HARLOWE  Four letters are written by Mr Lovelace from the date of his last giving the state of affairs between him and the lady pretty much the same as in hers in the same period allowing for the humour in his and for his resentments expressed with vehemence on her resolution to leave him if her friends could be prevailed uponA few extracts from them will be only given  'What says he might have become of me and my projects had not her father and the rest of the  implacables stood my friends' After violent threatnings and vows of revenge he says ''Tis plain she would have given me up for ever nor should I have been able to prevent her abandoning of me unless I had torn up the tree by the roots to come at the fruit which I hope still to bring down by a gentle shake or two if I can but have patience to stay the ripening season'  Thus triumphing in his unpolite cruelty he says  'After her haughty treatment of me I am resolved she shall speak out There are a thousand beauties to be discovered in the face in the accent in th  bushbeating hesitations of a woman that is earnest about a subject which she wants to introduce yet knows not how Silly rogues calling themselves generous ones would value themselves for sparing a lady's confusion But they are silly rogues indeed▪ and rob themselves of prodigious pleasure by the  forwardness and at the same time deprive her o  displaying a world of charms which only can be manifested on these occasions Hardheartedness as it is called is an essential of the libertine's character Familiarized to the distresses he occasions he is seldom betray'd by tenderness into a complai+sant weakness unworthy of himself How have I enjoyed a charming creature's confusion as I have sat overagainst her her eyes lost in admiration of my shoebuckles or meditating some uncouth figure in the carpet'  Mentioning the settlements he says  'I am in earnest as to the terms If I marry her and I have no doubt but that I shall after my pride my ambition my  revenge  if thou wilt is gratify'd I will do her noble justice The more I do for such a prudent such an excellent oeconomist the more shall I do for myselfBut by my soul Belford her haughtiness shall be brought down to own both love  and obligation to meNor will this sketch of settlements bring us forwarder than I would have it Modesty of sex will stand my friend at any time At the very altar our hands join'd I'd engage to make this proud beauty leave the parson and me and all my friends present tho' there were twenty of them to look like fools upon one another while she took wing and flew out of the churchdoor or window if that were open and the door shut and this only by a very word'  He mentions his rash expression that she should be his altho' damnation were to be the purchase and owns that at that instant he was upon the point of making a violent attempt but that he was check'd in the very moment and but just in time by the awe he was struck with on again casting his eye upon her terrified but lovely face and seeing as he thought her spotless heart in every line of it  'O virtue virtue says he what is there in thee that can thus affect the heart of such a man as me against my willWhence these involuntary tremors and fear of giving mortal offenceWhat art thou that acting in the breast of a feeble woman canst strike so much awe into a spirit so intrepid Which never before no not in my first attempt young as I then was and frighted at my own boldness till I found myself  forgiven  had such an effect upon me'  He paints in lively colours that part of the scene  tween him and the Lady where she says  'The word  father  has a sweet and venerable found with it'  'I was exceedingly affected says he upon the occasion But was ashamed to be surprised by her into such a fit of unmanly weaknessSo ashamed that I was resolved to subdue it at the instant and guard against the like for the future Yet at that  moment I more than half regretted that I could not permit her to enjoy a triumph which she so well deserved to glory inHer youth her beauty her artless innocence and her manner equally beyond comparison or description But her  indiffe  ence  BelfordThat she could resolve to sacrifice me to the malice of my enemies and carry on the desig  in so clandestine a mannerYet love her as I do to frenzyRevere her as I do to adorationThese were the recollections with which I fortify'd my recreant heart against herYet after all if she persevere she must conquerCoward as she has made me that never was a coward before'  HE concludes his fourth letter in a vehement rage upon her repulsing him when he offer'd to salute her having supposed as he owns that she would have bee  all condescension on his proposals to her  'This  says he  I will for ever remember against her in order to steel my own heart that I may c  thro' a rock of ice to hers and repay her for th  disdain the scorn which glow'd in her countenance and was apparent in her air at her abrup  departure from me after such obliging behaviour on my side and after I had so earnestly pressed h  for an early dayThe women below say Sh  hates me she despises meAnd 'tis true Sh  does she mustAnd why cannot I take their adviceI will not long my fair one be despised by thee and laughed at by them'  'Let me acquaint thee Jack adds he by way of postscript That this effort of hers to leave me if she could have been received her sending for a coach on Sunday no doubt resolving not to return if she had gone out without me for did she not declare that she had thought to retire to some of the villages about town where she could be safe and private have al  together so much alarm'd me that I have been adding to the written instructions for my servant and the people below how to act in case she should elope in my absence Particularly letting my fellow know what he shall report to strangers in case she shall throw herself upon any such with a resolution to abandon me These instructions I shall further add to as circumstances offer'  LETTER XV Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday May    I Have neither time nor patience my dear friend to answer to every material article in your last let  ers just now received Mr Lovelace's proposals  e all I like of him And yet as you do I think  hat he concludes them not with that warmth and  arnestness which we might naturally have expected  om him Never in my life did I hear or read of so  atient a man with such a blessing in his reach But  retches of his cast between you and me my dear  ave not I fancy the ardors that honest men have Who knows as your Bell once spitefully said but he may have half a dozen creatures to quit his hands of before he engages for lifeYet I believe you must not expect him to be honest on this side of his grand  macteric  He  to suggest delay from a compliment to be made to Lord M and to give time for settlements  He  a part of whose character it is not to know what complaisance to his relations isI have no patience with himYou did indeed want an interposing  iend on the affecting occasion which you mention  n yours of yesterday morning But upon my word were I to have been that moment in your  u  tion and been so treated I would have torn his  eyes out and left it to his own heart when I had done to furnish the reason for it  Would to Heaven tomorrow without complimenting anybody might be his happy day  Villain After he had himself suggested the complimentAnd I think he accuses YOU of delayingFellow that he isHow my heart is wrung  But as matters now stand betwixt you I am very unseasonable in expressing my resentments against himYet I don't know whether I am or not neither since it is the cruellest of fates for a woman to be forced to have a man whom her heart despises You must at  least  despise him at times however His clenched fist offered to his forehead on your leaving him in just displeasure I wish it had been a poleax and in the hand of his worst enemy  I will endeavour to think of some method of some scheme to get you from him and to fix you safel  somewhere till your cousin Morden arrives A scheme to lie by you and to be pursued as occasio  may be given You are sure that you can go abroa  when you please and that our correspondence is safe I cannot however for the reasons heretofore mentioned respecting your own reputation wish you  leave him while he gives you not cause to suspec  his honour But your heart I know would be th  easier if you were sure of some asylum in case of necessity  Yet once more I say I can have no notion th  he can or dare to mean you dishonourBut then th  man is a fool my dearthat's all  However since you are thrown upon a fool ma  the fool at the first opportunity and tho' I do  that this man will be the most ungovernable of foo  as all witty and vain fools are take him as a punishment since you cannot as a reward In short as o  given to convince you that there is nothing but i  perfection in this life  I shall be impatient till I have your next I am my dearest friend  Your everaffectionate and faithful  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XVI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wednesday May    I Would conceal nothing from you that relates to yourself so much as the inclosed You will see what the noble writer apprehends from you and wishes of you with regard to Miss Harlowe and how much at heart all your relations have it that you do honourably by her They compliment me with an influence over you which I wish with all my soul you would let me have in this article  Let me once more intreat thee Lovelace to reflect before it be too late before the mortal offence  e given upon the graces and merits of this lady Let thy frequent remorses at last end in one effectual one Let not pride and wantonness of heart ruin thy fairer prospects By my faith Lovelace there is nothing  ut vanity conceit and nonsense in our wild schemes As we grow older we shall be wiser and looking back upon our foolish notions of the present hour shall certainly despise ourselves our youth dissipated when we think of the honourable engagements we might have made Thou more especially if thou lettest such a matchless creature slide thro' thy fingers A creature pure from her cradle In all her actions and sentiments uniformly noble Strict in the performance of all her even  unrewarded  duties to the most unreasonable of fathers what a wife will she make the man who shall have the honour to call her his  Reflect likewise upon her sufferings for thee Actually  at the time thou art forming schemes to ruin her at least in  her  sense of the word is she not labouring under a father's curse laid upon her by thy means and for thy sake And wouldst thou give operation and completion to this curse  And what Lovelace all the time is thy pride Thou that vainly imaginest that the whole family of the Harlowes and that of the Howes too are but thy machines unknown to themselves to bring about thy purposes and thy revenge What art thou more or better than the instrument even of her implacable brother and envious sister to perpetrate the disgrace of the most excellent of sisters which they are moved to by vilely low and sordid motivesCanst thou bear Lovelace to be thought the machine of thy inveterate enemy James HarloweNay art thou not the cully of that still viler Joseph Leman who serves himself as much by thy money as he does thee by the double part he acts by thy directionAnd the devil's agent besides who only can and who certainly will suitably reward thee if thou proceedest and if thou effectest thy wicked purpose  Could any man but you put together upon paper the following questions with so much unconcern as you seem to have written themGive them a reperusal O heart of adamant  'Whither can she fly to avoid me Her parents will not receive her her uncles will not entertain her Her beloved Norton is in their direction and cannot Miss Howe dare not She has not one friend in town but ME Is intirely a stranger to the town  See Letter  ii  p    '  What must that heart be that can triumph in a distress so deep into which she has been plunged by thy elaborate arts and contrivances And what a sweet yet sad reflection was that which had almost had its due effect upon thee arising from thy naming Lord M for her nuptial father Her tender years inclining  her to  wish  a father and to  hope  a friendO my dear Lovelace canst thou resolve to be instead of the father thou hast robbed her of a devil  Thou knowest that I have no interest that I can have no view in wishing thee to do justice to this admirable creature For thy own sake once more I conjure thee for thy family's sake and for the sake of our common humanity let me beseech thee to be just to Miss Clarissa Harlowe  No matter whether these expostulations are in character from me or not I  have  been and  am  bad enough If thou takest my advice which is as the inclosed will shew thee the advice of all thy family thou wilt perhaps have it to reproach me and but perhaps neither that thou art not a worse man than myself But if thou dost  not  and if thou ruinest such a virtue all the complicated wickedness of ten devils let loose among the innocent with full power over them will not do so much vile and base mischief as thou wilt be guilty of  It is said that the prince on his throne is not safe if a mind so desperate can be found as values not its  own  life So may it be said that the most immaculate virtue is not safe if a man can be met with who has no regard to his own honour and makes a jest of the most solemn vows and protestations  Thou mayest by trick chicane and false colours thou who art worse than a pickeroon in love overcome a poor lady so intangled as thou hast intangled her so unprotected as thou hast made her But consider how much more generous and just to her and noble to thyself it is to overcome  thyself    Once more it is no matter whether my past or future actions countenance my preachment as perhaps thou'lt call what I have written But this I promise thee that whenever I meet with a woman of but one half of Miss Harlowe's perfections who will favour me with her acceptance I will take the advice  I give and marry Nor will I attempt to try her honour at the hazard of my own In other words I will not degrade an excellent creature in her own eyes by trials when I have no cause for suspicion And let me add with respect to thy  Eagleship  's manifestation of which thou boastest in thy attempts upon the innocent and uncorrupted rather than upon those whom thou humourously comparest to wrens  philtits  and wagtails  Vol  III  p    that I hope I have it not once to reproach myself that I ruin'd the morals of any one creature who otherwise would have been uncorrupted Guilt enough in contributing to the  continued  guilt of other poor wretches if I am one of those who take care she shall never rise again when she has once fallen  Whatever the capital devil under whose banner thou hast listed will let thee do with regard to this incomparable woman I hope thou wilt act with honour in relation to the inclosed between Lord M and me who as thou wilt see desires that thou mayest not know he wrote on the subject for reasons I think very far from being creditable to thyself And that thou wilt take as meant the honest zeal for thy service of  Thy real friend  J BELFORD  LETTER XVII Lord  M  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Inclosed in the preceding  M Hall  Monday May    SIR  IF any man in the world has power over my nephew it is you I therefore write this to beg you to interfere in the affair depending between him and the most accomplished of women as every one says and  what every one says must be true    I don't know that he has any bad designs upon her but I know his temper too well not to be apprehensive upon such long delays And the ladies here have been for some time in fear for her my sister Sadleir in particular who you know is a wise woman says that these delays in the present case must be from him rather than from the lady He had always indeed a strong antipathy to marriage and may think of playing his dog's tricks by her as he has by so many others If there's any danger of this 'tis best to prevent it in time For  when a thing is done advice comes too late    He has always had the folly and impertinence to make a jest of me for using proverbs But as they are the wisdom of whole nations and ages collected into a small compass I am not to be shamed out of sentences that often contain more wisdom in them than the tedious harangues of most of our parsons and moralists Let him laugh at them if he pleases You and I know better things Mr Belford  Tho' you have kept company with a wolf you have not learnt to howl of him  But nevertheless you must not let him know that I have written to you on this subject I am ashamed to say it but he has ever treated me as if I were a man of very common understanding And would perhaps think never the better of the best advice in the world for coming from me  I am sure he has no reason to slight me as he does He may and will be the better for me if he outlives me tho' he once told me to my face That I might do as I would with my estate for that he for his part loved his liberty as much as he despised money He thought I suppose that  I could not cover him with my wings without pecking at him with my bill  tho' I never used to be pecking at him without very great occasion And God knows he might have my very heart if he would but endeavour to oblige me by  studying his own good for that is all I desire of him Indeed it was his poor mother that first spoil'd him and I have been but too indulgent to him sinceA fine grateful disposition you'll say to  return evil for good  But that was always his way  This match however as the lady has such an extraordinary share of wisdom and goodness might set all to rights and if you can forward it I would enable him to make whatever settlements he could wish and should not be unwilling to put him in possession of another pretty estate besides For what do I live for as I have often said but to see him and my two nieces well married and settled May heaven settle him down to a better mind and turn his heart to more of goodness and consideration  If the delays are on his side I tremble for the lady and if on hers as he tells my niece Charlotte I could wish the young lady were apprized that  Delays are dangerous  Excellent as she is I can tell her she ought not to depend on her merits with such a changeable fellow and such a professed marriagehater as he has been I know you are very good at giving kind hints  A word to the wise is enough  I wish you would try what you can do with him for I have warned him so often of his wicked practices that I begin to despair of my words having any effect upon him But let him remember that  Vengeance tho' it comes with leaden feet strikes with iron hands  If he behaves ill in this case he may find it so What a pity it is that a man of his talents and learning should be so vile a rake Alas alas  Une poignée de bonne vie vaut mieux que plein muy de clergé  A handful of good life is better than a whole bushel of learning  You may throw in too as his friend that should he provoke me it may not be too late for me to marry My old friend Wycherly did so when he was older than I am on purpose to plague  his  nephew  And inspite of this gout I might have a child or two still And have not been without some thoughts that way when he has angered me more than ordinary But these thoughts have gone off again hitherto upon my considering that  the children of very young and very old men  tho' I am not so very old neither  last not long  and that  old men when they marry young women  are said to  make much of death  Yet who knows but that matrimony might be good against the gouty humours I am troubled with  The sentences that I have purposely wove into my discourse may be of some service to you in talking to him but use them sparingly that he may not discover that you borrow your  darts  from my  quiver    May your good counsels Mr Belford founded upon the hints I have given pierce his heart and incite him to do what will be so happy for himself and so necessary for the honour of that admirable lady whom I long to see his wife and if I may I will not think of one for myself  Should he abuse the confidence she has plac'd in him I myself shall pray that vengeance may f  ll upon his head  Raro    Raro  I quite forget all my Latin but I think it is  Raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo  Where vice goes before vengeance sooner or later will follow  I shall make no apologies to you for this trouble I know how well you love him and me and there is nothing in which you could serve us both more importantly than in forwarding this match to the utmost of your power When it is done how shall I rejoice to see you at M Hall Mean time I shall long to hear that you are likely to be successful and am  Dear Sir  Your most faithful friend and servant  M  Mr Lovelace having not returned an answer to Mr Belford's expostulatory letter so soon as Mr Belford expected he wrote to him expressing his apprehension that he had disobliged him by his honest freedom Among other things he says  'I pass my time here at Watford attending my dying uncle very heavily I cannot therefore by any means dispense with thy correspondence And why shouldst thou punish me for having more conscience and remorse than thyself Thou who never thoughtest either conscience or remorse an honour to thee And I have besides a melancholy story to tell thee in relation to Belton and his Thomasine and which may afford a lesson to all the keeping class'  'I have a letter from each of our three companions in the time They have all the wickedness that thou hast but not the wit Some new rogueries do two of them boast of which I think it completed deserve the gallows'  'I am far from hating intrigue upon principle But to have aukward fellows plot and commit their plots to paper destitute of the seasonings of the  acumen  which is thy talent how extremely shocking must their letters beBut do thou Lovelace whether thou art or art not determined upon thy measures with regard to the fine lady in thy power enliven my heavy heart by thy communications and thou wilt oblige  Thy melancholy friend  J BELFORD  LETTER XVIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Friday Night May    WHEN I have opened my views to thee so amply as I have done in my former letters and have told thee that my principal design is but to bring virtue to a trial that  if  virtue it need not be afraid of and that the reward of it will be marriage that is to say if after I have carried my point I cannot prevail upon her to live with me the Life of Honour  See Vol  III  p    for that thou knowest is the wish of my heart I am amazed at the repetition of thy wambling nonsense  I am of opinion with thee that some time hence when I am  grown wiser  I shall conclude that  there is nothing but vanity conceit and nonsense in my present wild schemes  But what is this saying but that I must be  first  wiser  I do not intend  to let this matchless creature slide through my fingers    Art thou able to say half the things in her praise that I have said and am continually saying or writing  Her gloomy father cursed the sweet creature because she put it out of his wicked power to compel her to have the man she hated Thou knowest how little merit she has with me on this scoreAnd shall I not try the virtue I intend upon full proof to reward because her father is a tyrantWhy art thou thus eternally reflecting upon so excellent a woman as if thou wert assured she would fail in the trialNay thou declarest every time thou writest on the subject that she  will  that she  must  yield  intangled as she is  And yet makest her virtue the pretence of thy solicitude for her  An instrument of the vile James Harlowe  dost thou call meO Jack how I could curse thee  I  an  instrument  of that brother of that sisterBut mark the endAnd thou shalt see what will become of that brother and of that sister  Play not against me my own acknowleged sensibilities I desire thee Sensibilities which at the same time that they contradict thy charge of an  adamantine heart  in thy friend thou hadst known nothing of had I not communicated them to thee  If I ruin such a virtue  sayest thouEternal monotonistAgain  The most immaculate virtue may be ruined by men who have no regard to their honour and who make a jest of the most solemn oaths  c What must be the virtue that will be ruined without oaths Is not the world full of these deceptions And are not  lovers oaths  a jest of hundreds of years standing And are not cautions against the perfidy of our sex a necessary part of the female education  I do intend to endeavour to overcome  myself  but I must first try if I cannot overcome  this lady  Have I not said that the honour of her Sex is concerned that I should  try  Whenever thou meetest with a woman of but half her perfections thou wilt marry  Do Jack  Can a girl be  degraded by trials  who is not  overcome  I am glad that thou takest crime to thyself for not endeavouring to convert the poor wretches whom  others  have ruined I will not recriminate upon thee Belford as I might when thou flatterest thyself that thou never ruinedst the morals of any young creature who otherwise would not have been corruptedThe palliating consolation of an Hottentot heart determined rather to gluttonize on the garbage of other soul feeders than to reformBut tell me Jack wouldst thou have spared such a girl as my Rosebud had I not by my example engaged thy generosity Nor was my Rosebud the only girl I sparedWhen my power was acknowleged who more merciful than thy friend  It is  resistance  that inflames desire  Sharpens the darts of love and blows its fire  Love is disarm'd that meets with too much ease  He languishes and does not care to please  The women know this as well as the men They love to be addressed with spirit  And therefore 'tis their golden fruit they guard  With so much care to make possession hard  Whence for a byreflection the ardent the complaisant Gallant is so often preferr'd to the cold Husband And yet the Sex do not consider that Variety or Novelty gives the ardour and the obsequiousness and that were the Rake as much used to them as the Husband is he would be and is to his own wife if married  as  indifferent to their favours and the Husband in his turn would to another woman be the Rake Let the women upon the whole take this lesson from a LovelaceAlways to endeavour to make themselves as New to a Husband and to appear as elegant and as obliging to him as they are desirous to appear to a Lover and actually were to him as  such  and then the Rake which all women love will last longer in the Husband than it generally does  But to returnIf I have not sufficiently clear'd my conduct to thee in the above I refer thee once more to mine of the th of last month  See Vol  III  Letter  xvii  p    And pr'ythee Jack lay me not under a necessity to repeat the same things so often I hope thou readest what I write more than once  I am not displeased that thou art so apprehensive of my resentment that I cannot miss a day without making thee uneasy Thy conscience 'tis plain tells thee that thou hast deserved my displeasure And if it has convinced thee of  that  it will make thee afraid of repeating thy fault See that this be the consequence Else now that thou hast told me how I can punish  thee it is very likely that I do punish thee by my silence altho' I have as much pleasure in writing on this charming subject as thou canst have in reading what I write  When a boy if a dog ran away from me thro' fear I generally looked about for a stone a stick or a brickbat and if neither offer'd to my hand I skimm'd my hat after him to make him afraid for something What signifies power if we do not exert it  Let my Lord know thou hast scribbled to me But give him not the contents of thy epistle Tho' a parcel of crude stuff  he  would think there was something in it Poor arguments will do in favour of what we like But the stupid Peer little thinks that this lady is a rebel to love On the contrary not only he but all the world believe her to be a volunteer in his serviceSo I shall incur blame and she will be pity'd if any thing happen amiss  Since my Lord's heart is so set upon this match I have written already to let him know  'That my unhappy character has given my beloved an ungenerous diffidence of me That she is so mothersick and fatherfond that she had rather return to HarlowePlace than marry That she is even apprehensive that the step she has taken of going off with me will make the ladies of a family of such name and rank as ours think slightly of her That therefore I desire his Lordship tho' this hint I tell him must be very delicately touched to write me such a letter as I can shew her Let him treat me in it ever so freely I shall not take it amiss because I know his Lordship takes pleasure in writing to me in a corrective style That he may make what offers he pleases on the marriage That I desire his presence at the ceremony that I may take from his hand the greatest blessing that mortal man can give me'  I have not absolutely told the lady that I would write to his Lordship to this effect yet have given her reason to think I will So that without the last necessity I shall not produce the answer I expect from him For I am very loth I own to make use of any of my family's names for the furthering of my designs And yet I must make all secure before I pull off the mask This was my motive for bringing her hither  Thus thou seest that the old Peer's letter came very seasonably I thank thee for it But as to his sentences they cannot possibly do me good I was early suffocated with his  Wisdom of nations  When a boy I never asked any thing of him but out flew a  proverb  and if the tendency of that was to deny me I never could obtain the least favour This gave me so great an aversion to the very word that when a child I made it a condition with my tutor who was an honest parson that I would not read my Bible at all if he would not excuse me one of the wisest books in it To which however I had no other objection than that it was called  The Proverbs  And as for Solomon he was then a hated character with me not because of his polygamy but because I had conceived him to be such another musty old fellow as my uncle  Well but let us leave old saws to old menWhat signifies thy tedious whining over thy departing relation Is it not generally agreed that he cannot recover Will it not be kind in thee to put him out of his misery I hear that he is pester'd still with visits from doctors and apothecaries and surgeons that they cannot cut so deep as the mortification has gone and that in every visit in every scarification inevitable death is pronounced upon him Why then do they keep tormenting him Is it not to take away more of his living fleece than of his dead fleshWhen a man is given over the fee should surely be refused Are they not now robbing his heirsWhat hast thou to do if the will be as thou'dst have it  He sent for thee Did he not to close his eyes He is but an  uncle  is he  Let me see if I mistake not it is in the Bible or some other good book Can it be in HerodotusO I believe it is in Josephus A halfsacred and halfprofane author He tells us of a king of Syria put out of his pain by his prime minister or one who deserved to be so for his contrivance The story says if I am right that he spread a wet cloth over his face which killing him he reigned in his place A notable fellow Perhaps this wet cloth in the original is what we now call  laudanum  a potion that overspreads the faculties as the wet cloth did the face of the royal patient and the translator knew not how to render it  But how like a forlorn varlet thou subscribest  Thy melancholy friend  J BELFORDMelancholy for what To stand by and see fair play between an old man and death I thought thou hadst been more of a man thou that art not afraid of an acute death a sword's point to be so plaguily hyp'd at the consequences of a chronical oneWhat tho' the scarificators work upon him day by day it is only upon a  caput mortuum  And pr'ythee  Go to  to use the  stylum veterum  and learn of the  Royal butchers  who for sport an hundred times worse men than thy Lovelace widow ten thousand at a brush and make twice as many fatherless and are dubb'd  Magnus  or  Le Grand  for it Learn of  them  I say how to support a  single  death  I wish  my  uncle had given  me  the opportunity of setting thee a better example Thou shouldst have seen what a brave fellow I had been And had I had occasion to write my conclusion would have been this 'I hope the old Trojan's happy In that hope I am so and  'Thy rejoicing friend  'R LOVELACE'  Dwell not always Jack upon one subject Let me have poor Belton's story the sooner the better If I can be of service to him tell him he may command me either in purse or person Yet the former with a freer will than the latter for how can I leave my goddess But I'll issue my commands to my other vassals to attend thy summons If ye want  head  let me know If not my quota on this occasion is  money    LETTER XIX Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Saturday May    NOT one word will I reply to such an abandon'd wretch as thou hast shewn thyself to be in thine of last night I will leave the lady to the protection of that Power who only can work miracles and to her own merits Still I have hopes that these will save her  I will proceed as thou desirest to poor Belton's case and the rather as it has thrown me into such a train of thinking upon our past lives our present courses and our future views as may be of service to both if I can give due weight to the reflections that arise from it  The poor man made me a visit on Thursday in this my melancholy attendance He began with complaints of his ill health and spirits his hectic cough and his increased malady of spitting of blood and then led to his story  A confounded one it is and which highly aggravates his other maladies For it has come out that his Thomasine who truly would be newchristen'd you know that her name might be nearer in sound to the christian name of the man whom she pretended to doat upon has for many years carried on an intrigue  with a fellow who had been hostler to her father an  innkeeper at Darking of whom at the expence o  poor Tom she has made a gentleman and managed it so that having the art to make herself his cashier she has been unable to account for large sums which poor Belton thought forthcoming at his demand and had trusted to her custody in order to pay off a mortgage upon his paternal estate in Kent which his heart had run upon leaving clear but which cannot now be done and will soon be foreclosed And yet she has so long passed for his wife that he knows not what to resolve upon about her nor about the two boys he was so fond of supposing them to be his whereas now he begins to doubt his share in them  So KEEPING don't do Lovelace 'Tis not the eligible life  'A man my  keep a woman  said the poor fellow to me but  not his estate  Two interestsThen my tottering fabric'  pointing to his emaciated carcase  We do well to value ourselves upon our  liberty  or to speak more properly upon the liberties we take We had need to run down matrimony as we do and to make that state the subject of our frothy jests when we frequently render ourselves for this of Tom's is not a  singular  case the dupes and fools of women who generally govern us by arts our wise heads penetrate not more absolutely than a wife would attempt to do  Let us consider this point a little and that upon our own  principles  as  libertines  setting aside what the  laws of our country  and its  customs  oblige from us which nevertheless we cannot get over till we have got over almost all moral obligations as members of society  In the first place let us consider we who are in possession of estates by  legal descent  how we should have liked to have been such naked destitute varlets as we must have been had our fathers been as wise  as ourselves and despised matrimony as we doAnd then let us ask ourselves if we ought not to have the same regard for  our  posterity as we are glad our fathers had for  theirs  But this perhaps is too  moral  a considerationTo proceed therefore to those which will be more striking to  us  How can we reasonably expect oeconomy or frugality or any thing indeed but riot and waste from creatures who have an  interest  and must therefore have  views  different from our own  They know the uncertain tenure our fickle humours by which they hold And is it to be wonder'd at supposing them to be provident harlots that they should endeavour if they have the  power to lay up against a rainy day  or if they have  not  the power that they should squander all they can come at when they are sure of  nothing but the present hour  and when the life they live and the sacrifices they have made put conscience and honour out of the question  Whereas a  wife  having the same familyinterest with her husband lies not under either the same  apprehensions  or  temptations  and has not broken through of  necessity  at least has not  those  restraints which education has fasten'd upon her And if she make a private purse which we are told by antimatrimonialists all wives love to do and has children it goes all into the same family at the longrun  Then as to the great article of fidelity to your bed are not women of family who are welleducated under greater restraints than creatures who if they ever  had  reputation sacrifice it to sordid interest or to more sordid appetite the moment they give up to you Does not the example you furnish of having succeeded with her give encouragement for  others  to attempt her likewise For with all her blandishments can any man be so credulous  or so vain as to believe that the woman  be  could persuade  another  may not prevail upon  Adultery is so capital a guilt that even rakes and libertines if not wholly abandon'd and as I may say  invited  by a woman's levity disavow and condemn it But here in a state of KEEPING a woman is in no danger of incurring  legally  at least that guilt and you yourself have broken thro' and overthrown in her all the fences and boundaries of moral honesty and the modesty and reserves of her Sex And what tie shall hold her against inclination or interest And what shall deter an attempter  While a husband has this security from  legal  sanctions that if his wife be detected in a criminal conversation with a man of fortune the  most  likely by bribes to seduce her he may recover very great damages and procure a divorce besides Which to say nothing of the ignominy is a consideration that must have some force upon  both  parties And a wife must be vicious indeed and a reflection upon a man's own choice who for the sake of change and where there are no qualities to seduce nor affluence to corrupt will run so many hazards to injure her husband in the tenderest of all points  But there are difficulties in procuring a divorceAnd so there oughtAnd none says the rake in parting with a mistress whenever you suspect her or whenever weary of her you have a mind to change her for another  But must not the man be a brute indeed who can cast off a woman whom he has seduced If he take her from the town that's another thing without some flagrant reason something that will better justify him to  himself  as well as to  her  and to the  world  than mere  power  and  novelty  But I don't see if we judge by  fact  and by the  practice  of all we have been acquainted with of the  Keeping class  that we know how to part with them when we have them  That we know we  can  if we  will  is all we have for  it  And this leads us to bear many things from a  mistress  which we would not from a  wife  But if we are goodnatur'd and humane If the woman has  art  And what woman  wants  it who has fallen by  art  and to whose precarious situation  art  is so necessary If you have given her the credit of being called by your name If you have a settled place of abode and have received and paid visits in her company as your wife If she has brought you children you will allow that these are strong obligations upon you in the world's eye as well as to your own heart against tearing yourself from such close connexions She will stick to you as your skin And it will be next to flaying yourself to cast her off  Even if there be  cause  for it by infidelity she will have managed ill if she have not her defendersNor did I ever know a cause or a person so  bad  as to want advocates either from ill will to the one or pity to the other and you will then be thought a hardhearted miscreant And even were she to go off without credit to  herself  she will leave  you  as little especially with all those whose good opinion a man would wish to cultivate  Well then shall this poor privilege that we may part with a woman if we  will  be deem'd a balance for the other inconveniencies Shall it be thought by  us  who are men of family and fortune an equivalent for giving up equality of degree and taking for the partner of our bed and very probably more than the partner in our estates to the breach of all familyrule and order a lowborn a loweducated creature who has not brought anything into the common stock and can possibly make no returns for the solid benefits she receives but those libidinous ones which  a man cannot boast of but to  his  disgrace nor think of but to the shame of  both  Moreover as the man advances in years the fury of his libertinism will go off He will have different aims and pursuits which will diminish his appetite to ranging and make such a regular life as the matrimonial and familylife palatable to him and every day more palatable  If he has children and has reason to think them  his  and if his lewd courses have left him any estate he will have cause to regret the  restraint  his boasted  liberty  has laid him under and the valuable  privilege  it has deprived him of when he finds that it must descend to some relation for whom whether near or distant he cares not one farthing and who perhaps from his dissolute life if a man of virtue has held him in the utmost contempt  And were we to suppose his estate in his power to bequeath as he pleases why should a man resolve for the gratifying of his wicked humour only to bastardize his race Why should he wish to expose them to the scorn and insults of the rest of the worldWhy should he whether they are men or women lay them under the necessity of complying with proposals of marriage either inferior as to fortune or unequal as to ageWhy should he deprive the children he loves and who are themselves guilty of no fault if they have regard to morals and to legal and social sanctions of the respect they would wish to have and to deserveand of the opportunity of associating themselves with proper that is to say with  reputable  companyAnd why should he make them think themselves under obligation to every person of character who should vouchsafe to visit them▪ What little reason in a word would such children have to bless their father's obstinate defiance of the laws and customs of his country and for giving them  a mother whom they could not think of with honour to whose  crime  it was that they owed their very beings and whose example it was their duty to shun  If the education and morals of these children are left to chance as too generally they are for the man who has humanity and a feeling heart and who is capable of fondness for his offspring I take it for granted will marry the case is still worse his crime is perpetuated as I may say by his children And the Sea the Army perhaps the Highway for the boys the Common for the girls too often point out the way to a worse catastrophe  What therefore upon the whole do we get by treading in these crooked paths but danger disgrace and a too late repentance  And after all do we not frequently become the cullies of our own libertinism sliding into the very state with those halfwornout doxies which perhaps we might have enter'd into with their ladies at least with their superiors both in degree and fortune And all the time lived handsomely like ourselves not sneaking into holes and corners and when we crept abroad with our women looking about us at every opening into the street or day as if we were confessedly accountable to the censures of all honest people  My cousin Tony Jenyns thou knewest He had not the actively mischievous spirit that Thou Belton Mowbray Myself and Tourville have But he imbibed the same notions we do and carried them into practice  How did he prate against wedlock How did he strut about as a  wit  and a  smart  And what a  wit  and a  smart  did all the boys and girls of our family myself among the rest then an urchin think him for the airs he gave himselfMarry No not for the world what man of sense would bear the insolences  the petulances the expensiveness of a wife He could not for the heart of him think it tolerable that a woman of  equal  rank and fortune and as it might happen  superior  talents to his own should look upon herself to have a right to share the benefit of that fortune which she brought him  So after he had flutter'd about the town for two or three years in all which time he had a better opinion of himself than anybody else had what does he do but enter upon an affair with his fencingmaster's daughter  He succeeds takes private lodgings for her at Hackney visits her by stealth both of them tender of reputations that were  extremely  tender but which neither had quite given over for rakes of either sex are always the last to condemn or cry down themselves Visited by nobody nor visiting The life of a thief or of a man beset by creditors afraid to look out of his own house or to be seen abroad with her And thus went he on for twelve years and tho' he had a good estate hardly making both ends meet for tho' no glare there was no oeconomy and besides he had every year a child and very fond of them was he But none of them lived above three years And being now on the death of the dozenth grown as dully sober as if he had been a real husband his good Mrs Thomas for he had not permitted her to take his own name prevailed upon him to think the loss of their children a judgment upon the parents for their wicked way of life There is a time when calamities will beget reflection The royal cully of France thou knowest was  Maintenon  'd into it by his ill successes in the field And so when more than halfworn out  both  of them the sorry fellow took it into his head to marry her And then had leisure to sit down and contemplate the many offers of persons of family and fortune which he had declined in the prime of his life His expences  equal  at least His reputation not only  less  but  lost  His enjoyments  stollen  His partnership  unequal    and such as he had always been ashamed of But the women said That after twelve years cohabitation Tony did an honest thing by her And that was all my poor cousin got by making his old mistress his new wifeNot a drum not a trumpet not a fife not a tabret nor the expectation of a new joy to animate him on  What Belton will do with his Thomasine I know not nor care I to advise him For I see the poor fellow does not like that anybody should curse her but himself And that he does very heartily And so low is he reduced that he blubbers over the reflection upon his past fondness for her cubs and upon his present doubts of their being his  'What a dn'd thing is it Belford if Tom and Hall should be the hostler dog's puppies and not mine'  Very true and I think the strong health of the chubbyfaced muscular whelps confirms the too great probability But I say not so to him  You he says are such a gay lively mortal that this sad tale would make no impression upon you Especially now that your whole heart is engaged as it is Mowbray would be too violent upon it he has not he says a feeling heart Tourville has no discretion And a pretty jest although he and his Thomasine lived without reputation in the world People guessing that they were not married notwithstanding she went by his name yet  'he would not  too much  discredit the  cursed ingrate  neither'  Could a man act a weaker part had he been really married and were he sure he was going to separate from the mother of his own children  I leave this as a lesson upon thy heart without making any application Only with this remark That after we libertines have indulged our licentious appetites reflecting in the conceit of our vain hearts both with our lips and by our lives upon our ances  rs and the good old ways we find out when we  come to years of discretion if we live till then what all who knew us found out before that is to say we find out our own despicable folly that those good old ways would have been best for  us  as well as for the rest of the world and that in every step we have deviated from them we have only exposed our vanity and our ignorance at the same time  J BELFORD  LETTER XX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Saturday May    I Am pleased with the sober reflection thou concludest thy last with and I thank thee for it Poor BeltonI did not think his Thomasine would have proved so very a devil But this must everlastingly be the risque of a keeper who takes up with a lowbred girl This I never did Nor had I occasion to do Such a one as  I  Jack needed only till now to shake the stateliest tree and the mellow'd fruit dropt into my mouth Always of Montaign's taste thou knowestThought it a glory to subdue a girl of familyMore truly delightful to me the seductionprogress than the crowning actFor that's a vapour a bubbleAnd most cordially do I thank thee for thy indirect hint that I am right in my present pursuit  From such a lady as Miss Harlowe a man is secured from all the inconveniencies thou expatiates  upon  Once more therefore do I thank thee Belford for thy approbationOne need not as thou sayest sneak into holes and corners and shun the day in the company of such a lady as this How friendly in thee thus to abet the favourite purpose of my heartNor can it be a disgrace to me to permit such a lady to be called by my nameNor  shall I be at all concerned about the world's censure if I live to the  years of discretion  which thou mentionest should I be taken in and prevailed upon to tread with her the good old path of my ancestors  A blessing on thy heart thou honest fellow I  thought  thou wert but in jest or acting but by my uncle's desire when thou wert pleading for matrimony in behalf of this ladyIt could not be principle I knew in thee It could not be compassionA little  envy  indeed I suspectedBut now I see thee once more thyself And once more say I A blessing on thy heart thou true friend and very honest fellow  Now will I proceed with courage in all my schemes and oblige thee with the continued narrative of my progressions towards bringing them to effectBut I could not forbear to interrupt my story to shew my gratitude  LETTER XXI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Saturday May    AND now will I favour thee with a brief account of our present situation  From the highest to the lowest we are all extremely happy  Dorcas  stands well in her lady's graces  Polly  has asked her advice in relation to a courtship affair of her own No oracle ever gave better  Sally  has had a quarrel with her woollendraper and made my beloved Ladychancellor in it She blamed Sally for behaving tyrannically to a man who loves her Dear creature to stand against a glass and to shut her eyes because she will not see her face in itMrs Sinclair has paid  her  court to so unerring a judge by requesting her advice with regard to both nieces  This the way we have been in for several days with the people below Yet  sola  generally at her meals  and seldom at other times in their company They now used to her ways Perseverance must conquer never press her so when they meet all is civility on both sides Even marry'd people I believe Jack prevent abundance of quarrels by seeing one another but seldom  But how stands it between thyself and the lady methinks thou askest since her abrupt departure from thee and undutiful repulse of Wednesday morning Why pretty well in the main Nay very well For why The dear saucyface knows not how to help herself Can fly to no other protection And has besides overheard a conversation Who would have thought she had been so near which passed between Mrs Sinclair Miss Martin and myself that very Wednesday afternoon which has set her heart at ease with respect to several doubtful points  Such as particularly Mrs Fretchville's unhappy state of mindMost humanely pitied by Miss Martin who knows her very well the husband she has lost and herself lovers from their cradles Pity from one begets pity from another and so many circumstances were given to poor Mrs Fretchville's distress that it was impossible but my beloved must  extremely  pity her whom the less tenderhearted Miss Martin  greatly  pitied  My Lord M's gout his only hindrance from visit+ing my spouse  Lady Betty and Miss Montague soon expected i  town  My earnest desire signify'd to have my spouse receiv  them in her own house if Mrs Fretchville would bu  know her own mind  My intention to stay at their house notwithstanding  as I said I had told them before  in order to grati  her utmost punctilio  My passion for my beloved which I told them is a high and fervent accent was the truest that m  could have for woman I boasted of It was in short I said of the  true Platonic kind  or I had no notion of what Platonic Love was  So it is Jack and must end as Platonic Love generally does end  Sally and Mrs Sinclair praised  but not grosly  my beloved Sally particularly admired her purity called it exemplary yet to avoid suspicion expressed her thoughts that she was  rather overnice  if she might presume to say so before me But applauded me for the strict observation I made of my vow  I more freely blamed her reserves to me called her cruel inveighed against her relations doubted her love Every favour I asked of her deny'd me Yet my behaviour to her as pure and delicate when alone as when before them Hinted at something that had passed between us that very day that shewed her indifference to me in so strong a light that I could not bear it But that I would ask her for her company to the play of  Venice preserv'd  given out for Saturday night as a benefit play the prime actors to be in it and this to see if I were to be denied every favourYet for my own part I loved not tragedies tho' she did for the sake of the instruction the warning and the example generally given in them  I had too much  feeling  I said There was enough in the world to make our hearts sad without carrying grief into our diversions and making the distresses of others our own  True enough Belford and I believe generally speaking that all the men of our cast are of my mindThey love not any tragedies but those in which they themselves act the parts of tyrants and executioners and afraid to trust themselves with serious and solemn reflections run to comedies to laugh away the distresses they have occasioned and to find examples of  as immoral men as themselves For very few of our comic performances as thou knowest give us good onesI answer however for myselfYet thou I think on recollection lovest to deal in the  lamentable    Sally answered for Polly who was absent Mrs Sinclair for herself and for all her acquaintance even for Miss Partington in preferring the comic to the tragic scenesAnd I believe they are right for the devil's in it if a confidedin rake does not give a girl enough of tragedy in his comedy  I ask'd Sally to oblige my fairone with her company  She was engaged That was right thou'lt suppose I asked Mrs Sinclair's leave for Polly To be sure she answer'd Polly would think it an honour to attend Mrs Lovelace But the poor thing was tenderhearted and as the tragedy was deep would weep herself blind  Sally mean time objected Singleton that  I  might answer the objection and save my beloved the trouble of making it or debating the point with me  I then from a letter just before received from one in her father's family warned them of a person who had undertaken to find us out and whom I thus in writing calling for pen and ink described that they might arm all the family against him  'A sunburnt pockfretten sailor illlooking bigboned his stature about six foot an heavy eye an overhanging brow a decktreading stride in his walk a couteau generally by his side lips parched from his gums as if by staring at the sun in hot climates a brown coat a colour'd handkerchief about his neck an oaken plant in his hand near as long as himself and proportionably thick'  No questions must be answer'd that he should ask They should call me to him But not let my beloved know a tittle of this so long as it could be help'd And I added that if her brother or Singleton  came and if they behaved civilly I would for her sake be civil to  them  And in this case she had nothing to do but to own her marriage and there could be no pretence for violence on either side But most fervently I swore that if she was convey'd away either by persuasion or force I would directly on missing her but one day go to demand her at her father's whether she were there or not and if I recover'd not a sister I would have a brother and should find out a captain of a ship as well as he And now Jack dost thou think she'll attempt to get from me do what I will  Mrs Sinclair began to be afraid of mischief in her houseI was apprehensive that she would overdo the matter and be out of character I therefore wink'd at her She primm'd nodded to shew she took me twang'd out a highho lapp'd one horselip over the other and was silent  Here's preparation BelfordDost think I will throw it all away for any thing thou canst say or Lord M write  No indeed  as my charmer says when she bridles  AND what must necessarily be the consequence of all this with regard to my beloved's behaviour to meCanst thou doubt that it was all complaisance next time she admitted me into her presence  Thursday we were very happy All the morning  extremely  happy I kissed her charming handI need not describe to thee her hand and arm When thou sawest her I took notice that thy eyes dwelt upon them whenever thou couldst spare them from that beautyspot of wonders her face  Fifty  times kissed her hand I believeOnce her cheek intending her  lip but so rapturously that she could not help seeming angry  Had she not thus kept me at armslength had she not denied me those innocent liberties which our  Sex from degree to degree aspire to could I but have gained access to her in her hours of heedlessness and dishabille for full dress creates dignity augments consciousness and compels distance we had been familiarized to each other long ago But keep her up ever so late meet her ever so early by breakfasttime dressed for the day and at her earliest hour as nice as others dressedAll her forms thus kept up wonder not that I have made so little progress in the proposed trialBut how must all this distance stimulate  Thursday morning  I said we were extremely happyAbout  noon  she number'd the hours she had been with me all of them to me but as one minute and desired to be left to herself I was loth to comply But observing the sunshine begin to shut in I yielded  I dined out Returned talked of the house and of Mrs Fretchville Had seen MennellHad pressed him to get the widow to quitShe pitied Mrs FretchvilleAnother good effect of the overheard conversationHad written to my uncle expected an answer soon from him I was admitted to sup with her Urged for her approbation or correction of my written terms She promised an answer as soon as she had heard from Miss Howe  Then I pressed for her company to the play on Saturday night She made objections as I had foreseen Her brother's projects warmth of the weather  c  But in such a manner as if halfafraid to disoblige me Another happy effect of the overheard conversation Got over these therefore and she consented to favour me  Friday  passed as the day before  Here were two happy days to bothWhy cannot I make every day equally happy It looks as if it wer  in my power to do soStrange I should thus deligh  in teazing a woman I so dearly loveI must doubt have something in my temper like Miss Howe  who loves to plague the man who puts himself in her powerBut I could not do thus by such an angel as this did I not believe that after her probationtime is expired and if there is no bringing her to  cohabitation  my darling view I shall reward her as she wishes  Saturday  is halfover equally happyPreparing for the playPolly has offer'd and is accepted I have directed her where to weepAnd this not only to shew her humanity a weeping eye indicates a gentle heart but to have a pretence to hide her face with her fan or handkerchief yet Polly is far from being every man's girlAnd we shall sit in the gallery greenbox  The woes of others so well represented as those of Belvidera particularly will be must I hope unlock and open my charmer's heart Whenever I have been able to prevail upon a girl to permit me to attend her to a play I have thought myself sure of her The female heart all gentleness and harmony when obliged expands and forgets its forms when attention is carried out of itself at an agreeable or affecting entertainment Music and perhaps a collation afterwards cooperating I have no hope of such an effect here but I have more than one end to answer by my earnestness in getting her to a play To name but one Dorcas has a masterkey as I have told theeAnd it were worth carrying her to  Venice preserved  were it but to shew her that there have been and may be much deeper distresses than she can possibly know  Thus exceedingly happy are we at present I hope we shall not find any of Nat Lee's lefthanded gods at work to dash our bowl of joy with wormwood  The Lady in her next letter dated Friday May acquaints her friend that her prospects are once more mended and that she has known fourandtwenty hours together since her last not unhappy  ones her situation considered  'How willing am I  says she  to compound for tolerable appearances how desirous to turn the funny side of things towards me and to hope where reason for hope offers and this not only for my own sake but for yours who take such generous concern in all that befalls me'  She then gives the particulars of the conversation which she had overheard between Mr Lovelace Mrs Sinclair and Miss Martin but accounts more minutely than he had done for the opportunity she had of overhearing it unknown to them  She gives the reason she has to be pleased with what she heard from each But is shocked at the measure he is resolved to take if he misses her but for one day Yet is pleased that he proposes to avoid  aggressive  violence if her brother and he meet in town  She thought herself obliged she says from what passed between them on Wednesday and from what she overheard him say to consent to go with him to the play especially as he had the discretion to propose one of the nieces to accompany her  She expresses herself pleased that he has actually written to Lord M  She tells her that she has promised to give him an answer to his proposals as soon as she has heard from  her  on the subject And hopes that in her future letter she shall have reason to confirm these favourable appearances  'Favourable  says she  I must think them in the wreck I have suffer'd'  She thinks it not amiss however that she should perfect her scheme with Mrs Townsend He is certainly she says a deep and dangerous man and it is therefore but prudence to be watchful and to provide against the worst  She is certain she tells her that her letters are safe  He would never be out of her company by his goodwill otherwise she has no doubt that she is mistress of her goingsout and comingsin and did she think it needful and were she not afraid of her brother and Capt Singleton would oftener put it to trial  LETTER XXII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Saturday May    I Did not know my dear that you deferred giving an answer to Mr Lovelace's proposals till you had my opinion of them A particular hand occasionally going to town will leave this at Wilson's that no delay may be made on that account  I never had any doubt of the man's justice and generosity in matters of settlement and all his relations are as noble in their spirits as in their descent But  now  it may not be amiss for you to wait to see what returns my Lord makes to his letter of invitation  The scheme I think of is this  There is a person I believe you have seen her with me one Mrs Townsend who is a great dealer in Indian silks Brussels and French laces cambricks linen and other valuable goods which she has a way of coming at dutyfree and has a great vead for them and for other curiosities which she imports in the private families of the gentry round us  She has her days of being in town and then is at a chamber she rents in an inn in Southwark where she has patterns of all her silks and much of her portable goods for the conveniency of her London customers But her place of residence and where she has her principal warehouse is at Deptford for the opportunity of getting her goods on shore  She was first brought to me by my mother to whom she was recommended on the supposal of my speedy  marriage that I might have an opportunity to be as fine as a princess was my mamma's expression at a moderate expence  Now my dear I must own that I do not love to encourage these contraband traders What is it but bidding defiance to the laws of our country when we do and hurting fair traders and at the same time robbing our Prince of his legal due to the diminution of those duties which possibly must be made good by new levies upon the whole public  But however Mrs Townsend and I though we have not yet dealt are upon a very good foot of understanding She is a sensible woman she has been abroad and often goes abroad in the way of her business and gives very entertaining accounts of all she has seen And having applied to me to recommend her to you as it is her view to be known to young ladies who are likely to change their condition I am sure I can engage her to give you protection at her house at Deptford which she says is a populous village and one of the last I should think that you would be sought for in She is not much there you will believe by the course of her dealings but no doubt must have somebody on the spot in whom she can confide And there perhaps you might be safe till your cousin comes And I should not think it amiss that you write to him out of hand I cannot suggest to you what you should write That must be left to your own discretion For you will be afraid no doubt of the consequence of a variance between the two men  I will think further of this scheme of mine in relation to Mrs Townsend if you find it necessary that I should But I hope there will be no occasion to do so since your prospects seem to be changed and that you have had  twentyfournot unhappy hours together  How my indignation rises for this poor consolation in the courtship  courtship  must I call it of such a lady  Mrs Townsend as I have recollected has two brothers each a master of a vessel and who knows as she and they have great concerns together but that in case of need you may have a whole ship's crew at your devotion If he give your cause to leave him take no thought for the people at Harloweplace Let them take care of one another It is a care they are  used  to The Law will help to secure them The wretch is no assassin no nightmurderer He is an  open  because a  fearless  enemy and should he attempt any thing that should make him obnoxious to the Laws of society you might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows no matter which  Had you not been so minute in your account of the circumstances that attended the opportunity you had of overhearing the dialogue between Mr Lovelace and two of the women I should have thought the conference contrived on purpose for your ears  I shew'd Mr Lovelace's proposals to Mr Hickman who had chambers once at Lincoln'sInn being designed for the Law had his elder brother lived He looked so wise so proud and so important upon the occasion and wanted to take so much consideration about themwould take them home if I pleasedand weigh them welland soforthand the likeand all thatthat I had no patience with him and snatched them back with anger  O dearto be so angry and please me for his zeal  Yes zeal without knowlege I saidlike most other zealsIf there were no objections that struck him at once there were none  So  hasty  dearest Madam  And so  slow  undearest Sir I could have saidBut SURELY said I with a look which imply'd  Would you rebel Sir    He begged my pardon  Saw  no objection indeedBut might he be allowed once more  No matterNo matterI would have shewn them to my mother I said who tho' of no Inn of Court knew more of these things than half the lounging lubbers of them and that at first sightonly that she would have been provoking upon the confession of our continued correspondence  But my dear let the articles be drawn up and ingrossed and solemnize upon them and there's no more to be said  Let me add that the sailor fellow has been tampering with my Kitty and offered a bribe to find where to direct to you Next time he comes I will have him drawn through one of our deepest fishponds if I can get nothing out of him His attempt to corrupt a servant of mine will justify my orders  I send this away directly But will follow it by another which shall have for its subject only my Mother Myself and your uncle Antony And as your prospects are more promising than they have been I will endeavour to make you smile upon this occasion For you will be pleased to know that my mamma has had a formal tender from that grey goose which may make her skill useful to herself were she to encourage it  May your prospects be still more and more happy prays  Your own  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXIII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sat Sunday May    NOW my dear for the promised subject You must not ask me how I came by the  originals  such they really are that I am going to present you with For my mamma would not read to me those  parts of your uncle's letter which bore hard upon myself and which leave him without any title to mercy from me Nor would she let me hear but what she pleased of hers in answer for she has condescended to answer him with a denial howeverBut such a denial as noone but an  old batchelor  would take from a widow  Anybody except myself who could have been acquainted with such a fallal courtship as this must have been had it proceeded would have been glad it had gone on and I dare say but for the saucy daughter it had My mamma in that case would have been ten years the younger for it perhaps And could I but have approved of it I should have been considered as if ten years older than I am Since very likely it would then have been  'We widows my dear know not how to keep men at a distanceSo as to give them pain in order to try their loveYou must advise me child You must teach me to be cruelYet not  too  cruel neitherSo as to make a man heartless who has no time God wot to throw away'  Then would my behaviour to Mr Hickman have been better liked and my mother would have bridled like her daughter  O my dear how we might have been diverted by the practisings for recovery of the  Longforgottens  could I have been sure that it would have been in my power to have put them asunder in the Irish stile  before they had come together  But there's no trusting to a widow whose goods and chattels are in her own hands addressed by an old batchelor who has fine things and offers to leave her ten thousand pounds better than he found her and sole mistress besides of all her  Notables  for these as you'll see byandby are his proposals  The old Triton's address carries the writer's marks upon the very superscription  To the equally amiable and worthily admired  There's for you  Mrs  ANNABELLA  HOWE  widow  the last word added I suppose as  Esquire  to a man or for fear the  bella  to  Anna  should not enough distinguish the person meant from the spinster Vain hussey you'll call me I know And then follows  These humbly present  Put down as a memorandum I presume to make a leg and behave handsomely at presenting it he intending very probably to deliver it himself  And now stand byTo see  Enter OLD NEPTUNE  His head adorned with seaweed and a crown of cockleshells as we see him decked out in Mrs Robinson's ridiculous grotto  Monday May    Madam  I Did make a sort of resolution ten years ago never to marry I saw in other families where they lived  best  you'll be pleased to mark that  queernesses  I could not away with Then liked well enough to live single for sake of my brother's family and for one child in it more than the rest But that girl has turned us all off of the hinges And why I should deny myself any comforts for them as will not thank me for so doing I don't know  So much for my motives as from self and family But the dear Mrs Howe makes me go further  I have a very great fortune I bless God for it all of my own getting or  most  of it you'll be pleased to mark that for I was the younger brother of three You have also God be thanked a great estate which you have improved by your own frugality and wise management Frugality let me stop to say is one of the greatest virtues in this mortal life because it enables us to do justice to  all  and puts it in our power to benefit  some  by it as we see they  deserve    You have but one child and I am a batchelor and have never a oneAll batchelors cannot say so Wherefore your daughter may be the better for me  if she will keep up with my humour which was never thought bad Especially to my equals Servants indeed I don't matter being angry with when I please They are paid for bearing it and tootoo often deserve it as we have very frequently taken notice of to one another But this won't hurt neither you nor Miss  I will make very advantageous settlements such as any common friend shall judge to be so But must have all in my own power while I live Because you know Madam it is as creditable to the wife as the husband that it should be so  I aim not at fine words We are not children tho' it is hoped we may have some for I am a very healthy sound man I bless God for it And never brought home from my voyages and travels a worser constitution than I took out with me I was none of those I will assure you But this I will undertake that if you are the survivress you shall be at  the least  ten thousand pounds the better for me What in the contrary case I shall be the better for you I leave to you as you shall think my kindness to you shall deserve  But one thing Madam I should be glad of that Miss Howe might not live with us then She need not know I write thusBut go home to Mr Hickman as she is upon the point of marriage I hear And if she behaves dutifully as she should do to us both she shall be the better for so I said before  You shall manage all things both mine and your own for I know little of landmatters All my opposition to you shall be out of love when I think you take too much upon you for your health  It will be very pretty for you I should think to have a man of experience in a long winter's evening to sit down and tell you stories of foreign parts and the customs of the nations he has consorted with And I have fine curiosities of the Indian growth such as  ladies love and some that even my niece Clary when she was good never saw These one by one as you are kind to me which I make no question of because I shall be kind to you shall all be yoursPrettier entertainment by much than sitting with a too smartish daughter sometimes out of humour and thwarting and vexing as daughters will when womengrown especially as I have heard you often observe and thinking their parents old without paying them the reverence due to years when as in your case I make no sort of doubt they are young enough to wipe their noses You understand me Madam  As for me myself it will be very happy and I am delighted with the thinking of it to have after a pleasant ride or so a lady of like experience with myself to come home to and but one interest betwixt us To reckon up our comingsin together and what this day and this week has producedO how this will increase loveMost mightily will it increase itAnd I believe I should never love you enough or be able to shew you all my love  I hope Madam there need not be  such  maide  niceties and hangingsoff as I may call them between us for hangingoff sake as that you will deny me line or two to this proposal written down altho' yo  would not answer me so readily when I spoke to you Your daughter being I suppose hard by for yo  looked round you as if not willing to be overheard▪ So I resolved to write That my writing may stand as upon record for my upright meaning being no  of your Lovelaces you'll mark that Madam but  downright true honest faithful Englishman So hop  you will not disdain to write a line or two to this my proposal And I shall look upon it as a great honou  I will assure you and be proud thereofWhat can say moreFor you are your own mistress as I a  my own master And you shall  always  be your ow  mistress Be pleased to mark that for so a lady of your prudence and experience ought to be  This is a long letter But the subject requires it because I would not write twice where once would do So would explain my sense and meaning at one time  I have had writing in my head  two whole months very near  but hardly knew how being unpractised in these matters to begin to write And now good lady be favourable to  Your most humble Lover and obedient Servant  ANT HARLOWE  Here's a letter of courtship my dearAnd let me subjoin to it that if now or hereafter I should treat this hideous lover who is so free with me to my mother with asperity and you should be disgusted at it I shall think you don't give me that preference in your love which you have in mine  And now which shall I first give you the answer of my mamma or the dialogue that passed between the widowmother and the pert daughter upon her letting the latter know that she had a letter  I  think  you shall have the  dialogue  But let me premise one thing that if you  think  me too free you must not let it run in your head that I am writing of  your  uncle or of  my  mother But of a couple of old lovers no matter whom Reverence is too apt to be forgotten by second persons where the  Reverends  forget  first    Well then suppose my mamma after twice comeing into my closet to me and as often going out with very meaning features and lips ready to burst open but still closed as it were by compulsion a speech going off in a slight cough that never went near the lungs grown more resolute the third time of entrance and sitting down by me thus begin  Mother  I have a very serious matter to talk with you upon Nancy when you are disposed to attend to matters  within  ourselves and not let matters  without  ourselves wholly engross you  A good  selves  ish speechBut I thought that friendship and gratitude and humanity were matters that ought to be deemed of the most  intimate  concern to us But not to dwell upon her words  Daughter  I am  now  disposed to attend to every thing my mamma is  disposed  to say to me  M  Why then childWhy then my dearAnd the good lady's face looked  so  plump  so  smooth and  so  shiningI see you are all attention NancyBut don't be surprisedDon't be uneasyBut I haveI haveWhere is itAnd yet it lay next her heart never another near itSo no difficulty to have found itI have a  letter  my dearAnd out from her bosom it came But she still held it in her handI have a  letter  childIt isIt isIt is fromfrom a gentleman I assure youlifting up her head and smiling  There is no delight to a daughter thought I in such surprizes as seem to be  collecting  I will deprive my mamma of the satisfaction of making a  gradual  discovery  D  From Mr Antony Harlowe I suppose Madam  M  Lips drawn closer Eye raised Why my dearBut how I wonder could you think of Mr Antony Harlowe  D  How Madam could I think of anybody  else  M  How could you think of anybody  else  angrily and drawing back her face but do you know the subject Nancy  D  You have told it Madam by your manner of breaking it to me But indeed I questioned not  that he had  two  motives in his visits here  Both  equally agreeable to me for all that family love me dearly  M  No love lost if so between you and them But this  Rising  is what I getSo like your papaI never could open my heart to  him  D  Dear Madam excuse me Be so good as to open your heart to  me  I don't love the Harlowes But pray excuse me  M  You have put me quite out with your forward temperAngrily sitting down again  D  I will be all patience and attention May I be allowed to read his letter  M  I wanted to  advise  with you upon itBut you are such a strange creatureYou are always for answering one before one speaks  D  You'll be so good as to forgive me MadamBut I thought everybody he among the rest knew that you had always declared against a second marriage  M  And so I have But then it was in the mind I was in Things may offer  I stared  M  Nay don't be surprisedI don't intendI don't intend  D  Not perhaps in  the mind you are in  Madam  M  Pert creature  Rising again  We shall quarrel I seeThere's no  D  Once more dear Madam I beg your excuse I will attend in silencePray Madam sit down againPray doShe sat downMay I see the letter  No there are some things in it you won't likeYour temper is known I find to be unhappyBut nothing  bad  against you intimations on the contrary that you shall be the better for him if you oblige him  Not a living soul but the Harlowes I said thought me illtemper'd And I was contented that  they  should who could do as they had done by the most universally acknowleged sweetness in the world  Here we broke out a little but at last she read me some of the passages in itBut not the  most mightily  ridiculous yet I could hardly keep my countenance neither And when she had done  M  Well now Nancy tell me what you think of it  D  Nay pray Madam tell me what  you  think of it  M  I expect to be answered by an answer not by a questionYou don't  use  to be shy to speak your mind  D  Not when my mamma commands me to do so  M  Then speak it now  D  Without hearing it all  M  Speak to what you  have  heard  D  Why then MadamYou won't be my mamma HOWE if you give way to it  M  I am surprised at your assurance Nancy  D  I mean Madam you will then be my mamma HARLOWE  M  Oh dear heartBut I am not a fool  And her colour went and came  D  Dear MadamBut indeed I don't love a Harlowethat's what I meant I  am  your child and  must  be your child do what you will  M  A very pert one I am sure as ever mother bore And you  must  be my child do what I  will  As much as to say you would not if you could help it if I  D  How could I have such a thoughtIt woul  be  forward  indeed if I hadwhen I don't kno  what your  mind  is as to the proposalWhen the proposal is so very advantageous a one too  M  looking a little less discomposed Why indeed ten thousand pounds  D  And to be sure of outliving him Madam This staggered her a little  M  Sure  Nobody can be sureBut it is very likely that  D  Not at all Madam you was going to read something but stopt about his constitution His sobriety is well knownWhy Madam these gentlemen who have been at sea and in different climates and come home to relax from cares in a temperate one and are soberare the likeliest to live long of any men in the worldDon't you see that his very skin is a fortification of buff  M  Strange creature  D  God forbid that anybody I love and honour should  marry a man  in hopes to  bury him  But suppose Madam at your time of life  M  My  time of lifeDear heartWhat is my time of life pray  M  Not old Madam and that may be your danger  As I hope to live my dear my mamma smiled and looked not displeased with me  M  Why indeed childWhy indeed I must needs sayAnd then I should choose to do nothing froward as you are sometimes to hurt  you    D  Why as to that MadamI can't expect you should deprive yourself of any satisfaction  M  Satisfaction  my dearI don't say it would be a  satisfaction  But could I do any thing that would benefit  you  it would perhaps be an inducement to hold  one  conference upon the subject  D  My fortune already will be more considerable than my match if I am to have Mr Hickman  M  Why soMr Hickman's fortune is enough to intitle him to yours  D  If  you  think so that's enough  M  Not but I should think the worse of myself if I desired any body's death but I think as you say  Mr Antony Harlowe is a healthy man and bids fair for a long life  Bless me thought I how shall I do to know whether this be an objection or a recommendation  D  Will you forgive me Madam  M  What would the girl sayLooking as if she was half afraid to hear what  D  Only that if you marry a man of  his  time of life you stand two chances instead of one to be a nurse at  your  time of life  M  Saucebox  D  Dear MadamWhat I mean is only that these healthy old men sometimes fall into lingering disorders all at once And I humbly conceive that the infirmities of age are too uneasily borne with where the remembrance of the pleasanter season comes not in to relieve the healthier of the two  M  A strange girlI always told you that you know either too much to be argued with or too little for me to have patience with you  D  I can't but say I would be glad of your commands Madam how to behave myself to Mr Harlowe next time he comes  M  How to behave yourselfWhy if you retire with contempt of him when he next comes it will be but as you have been used to do of late  D  Then he  is  to come again Madam  M  And suppose he be  D  I can't help it if it be your pleasure MadamHe desires a line in answer to his fine letter If he comes it will be in pursuance of that line I presume  M  None of your arch and pert leers girlYou know I won't bear them I had a mind to hear wh  t you would say to this matter I have not wrote but I shall presently  D  It is mighty good of you Madam I hope the man will think so to answer his first application by letterPity  he should write twice if once will do    M  That fetch won't let you into my intention as to what I shall write It is too saucily put  D  Perhaps I can guess at your intention Madam were it to become me so to do  M  Perhaps I would not make a  Mr Hickman  of any gentleman using him the worse for respecting me  D  Nor perhaps would I Madam if I  liked  his respects  M  I understand you But perhaps it is in  your  power to make me hearken or not to Mr Harlowe  D  Young gentlemen who have probably a great deal of time before them need not be in haste for a wife Mr Hickman poor man must stay his time or take his remedy  M  He bears more from you than a man  ought    D  Then I doubt he gives a  reason  for the treatment he meets with  M  Provoking creature  D  I have but one request to make you Madam  M  A  dutiful  one I suppose What is it pray  D  That if  you  marry  I  may be permitted to live single  M  Perverse creatureI am sure  D  How can I expect Madam that you should refuse such terms  Ten thousand pounds  At the  least  ten thousand poundsA very handsome proposalSo many fine things too to give you one by one Dearest Madam forgive meI hope it is not yet so far gone that raillying  this man  will be thought want of duty to  you    M  Your raillying of  him  and your reverence to  me  it is plain have  one  source  D  I hope not Madam But ten thousand pounds  M  Is no unhandsome proposal  D  Indeed I think so I hope Madam you will not be behindhand with him in generosity  M  He won't be ten thousand pounds the better for me if he survive me  D  No Madam he can't expect that as you have a daughter and as he is a  batchelor and has not a child  poor old soul  M  Old soul NancyAnd thus to call him for being a batchelor and not having a childDoes this become you  D  Not old soul for that MadamBut half the sum five thousand pounds you can't engage for less Madam  M  That sum has your approbation thenLooking as if she'd be even with me  D  As he leaves it to your generosity Madam and as the reward of his kindness to you it can't be lessDo dear Madam permit me without incurring your displeasure to call him poor old soul again  M  Never was such a whimsical creatureTurning away for I believe I looked very archly a least I intended to do so to hide her involuntary smilingI hate that wicked sly look You give yourself very free airsDon't you  D  I snatched her hand and kiss'd itMy dear mamma be not angry with your girlYou have told me that you was very lively formerly  M  Formerly  Good lackBut were I to encourage his proposals you may be sure that for Mr Hickman's sake as well as yours I should make  wise agreement  D  You have both lived to years of prudence▪ Madam  M  Yes I suppose I am an  old soul  too  D  He also is for making a wise agreement o  hinting at one at least  M  Well the short and the long I suppose is this I have not your consent to marry  D  Indeed Madam you have not my  wishes  to marry  M  Let me tell you that if prudence consists in wishing well to  one's self  I see not but the  young flirts  are as prudent as the  old souls    D  Dear Madam Would you blame me if to wish you not to marry Mr Antony Harlowe is wishing well  to myself  M  You are mighty witty I wish you were as dutiful  D  I am more dutiful I hope than witty or I should be a fool as well as a saucebox  M  Let  me  judge of bothParents are only to live for their children let them deserve it or not That's  their  dutiful notion  D  Heaven forbid that I should wish if there be Two interests between my mamma and me that my mamma postpone her own for mine or give up any thing that would add to the real comforts of her life to oblige meTell me my dear mamma if you think this proposal will  M  I say That ten thousand pounds is such an ac  uisition to one's family that the offer of it deserves  civil return  D  Not the  offer  Madam The  chance  only  you have a view to an increase of family the mo  ey may provide  M  You cannot keep within tolerable boundsThat saucy fleer I cannot away with  D  Dearest dearest Madam forgive me but  old  ul  ran in my head againNay indeed and upon  y word I won't be robbed of that charming smile  nd again I kissed her hand  M  Away bold creature Nothing can be so pro  oking as to be made to smile when one would  hoose  and  ought  to be angry  D  But dear Madam if it be to  be  I presume  ou won't think of it before next winter  M  What now would the pert one be at  D  Because he only proposes to entertain you with  pretty stories of foreign nations in a winter's evening Dearest dearest Madam let me have the reading of his letter thro' I will forgive him all he says about  me    M  It may be a very difficult thing perhaps for a man of the best sense to write a Loveletter that may not be cavilled at  D  That's because lovers in their letters hit not the mediumThey either write too much nonsense or too little But do you call this  odd  soul's letter no more will I call him  old  soul if I can help it a Loveletter  M  Well well I see you are averse to this matter I am not to be your  mamma  you will live single if I marry I had a mind to see if generosity govern'd you in your views I shall pursue my own inclinations and if they should happen to be suitable to yours pray let me for the future be better rewarded by you than hitherto I have been  And away she flung without staying for a replyVex'd I dare say that I did not better approve of the proposalWere it only that the merit of denying might have been all her own and to lay the stronger obligation upon her saucy daughter  She wrote such a widowlike refusal when she went from me as might not exclude hope in any other wooer whatever it may do in Mr Tony Harlowe  It will be my part to take care to beat her off of the visit she halfpromises to make him upon condition of withdrawing his suit as you will observe in hers For who knows what effect the old batchelor's exotics  Farfetched and dearbought  you know is  proverb might otherwise have upon a woman's mind wanting nothing but unnecessaries gewgaw an  fineries and offered such as are not easily to be me with or purchased  Well but now I give you leave to read here in this place the copy of my mother's answer to you  uncle's letter Not one comment will I make upon it I know my duty better And here therefore taking the liberty to hope that I may in your present less disagreeable if not wholly agreeable situation provoke a smile from you I conclude myself  Your everaffectionate and faithful  ANNA HOWE  Mrs  ANNABELLA HOWE  To  ANTONY HARLOWE  Esq  Friday May    Mr Antony Harlowe SIR  IT is not usual I believe for our Sex to answer by pen and ink the first letter on these occasions The  first  letterHow odd is thatAs if I expected another which I do notBut then I think as I do not judge proper to encourage your proposal there is no reason why I should not answer in civility where so great a civility is intended Indeed I was always of opinion that a person was intitled to That and not to illusage because he had a respect for me And so I have often and often told my daughter  A woman I think makes but a poor figure in a man's eye afterwards and does no reputation to her Sex neither when she behaves like a tyrant to him beforehand  To be sure Sir if I were to change my condition I know not a gentleman whose proposal could be more agreeable Your nephew and nieces have enough without you My daughter is a fine fortune without me and I should take care to double it living or dy  ng were I to do such a thing So nobody need to be the worse for it But Nancy would not think so  All the comfort I know of in children is that when young they do with us what they will and all  s pretty in them to their very faults and when they are grown up they think their parents must live for  them only and deny themselves every thing for their sakes I know Nancy could not bear a fatherinlaw She would fly at the very thought of my being in earnest to give her one Not that I stand in fear of my daughter neither It is not fit I should But she has her poor papa's spirit A very violent one that wasAnd one would not choose you know Sir to enter into any affair that one knows one must renounce a daughter for or she a motherExcept indeed one's heart were much in itwhich I bless God mine is not  I have now been a widow these ten years nobody to controul meAnd I am said not to bear controul So Sir you and I are best as we are I believenay I am sure of itFor we want not what either hashaving both more than we know what to do with And I know I could not be in the least accountable for any of my ways  My daughter indeed tho' she is a fine girl as girls go She has too much sense indeed for her sex and knows she has it is more a check to me than one would wish a daughter to beFor one would not be always snapping at each other But she will soon be married and then not living together we shall only come together when we are pleased and stay away when we are not and so like other lovers never see any thing but the best sides of each other  I own for all this that I love her dearly and she me I dare say So would not wish to provoke her to do otherwise Besides the girl is so much regarded everywhere that having lived so much of my prime a widow I would not lay myself open to her censures or even to her indifference you know  Your generous proposal requires all this explicitness I thank you for your good opinion of me When I know you acquiesce with This my civil refusal and indeed Sir I am as much in earnest in it as if I had spoke broader I don't know but Nancy  and I may with your permission come to see your fine things for I am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad  So Sir let us only converse occasionally as we meet as we used to do without any other view to each other than good wishes Which I hope may not be lessen'd for this declining And then I shall always think myself  Your obliged servant  ANNABELLA HOWE  I sent word by Mrs Lorimer that I would write an answer But would take time for consideration So hope Sir you won't think it a slight I did not write sooner  LETTER XXIV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday May    I AM too much disturbed in my mind to think of any think but revenge or I had intended to give thee an account of Miss Harlowe's curious observations on the play  Miss Harlowe's  I say Thou knowest that I hate the name of  Harlowe  and I am exceedingly out of humour with her and with her saucy friend  What's the matter  now  thou'lt askMatter enough for while we were at the play Dorcas who had her orders and a key to her lady's chamber as well as a masterkey to her drawers and mahogany chest closetkey and all found means to come at some of Miss Howe's lastwritten letters The vigilant wench was directed to them by seeing her lady take a letter out of her stays and put it to the others before she went out with meAfraid as the women upbraidingly tell me that I should find it there  Dorcas no sooner found them than she assembled three ready writers of the  nonapparents  and Sally and she and they employed themselves with the utmost diligence in making extracts according to former directions from these cursed letters for my use  Cursed  I may well call themSuch abuses such virulence O this little fury Miss HoweWell might her saucy friend who has been equally free with me or the occasion could not have been given be so violent as she lately was at my endeavouring to come at one of these letters  I was sure that this fairone at so early an age with a constitution so firm health so blooming eyes so sparkling could not be absolutely and from her own vigilance so guarded and so apprehensive as I have found her to beSparkling eyes Jack when the poetical tribe have said all they can for them are an infallible sign of a rogue or room for a rogue in the heart  Thou may'st go on with thy preachments and Lord M with his Wisdom of nations I am now more assured of her than ever And now my revenge is up and join'd with my love all resistance must fall before it And most solemnly do I swear that Miss Howe shall come in for her snack  And here just now is another letter brought from the same little virulent devilI hope to procure transcripts from that too very speedily if it be put to the rest for the saucy lady is resolved to go to church this morning not so much from a spirit of devotion I have reason to think as to try whether she can go out without check or controul or my attendance  I HAVE been denied breakfasting with her Indeed she was a little displeased with me last night because on our return from the play I obliged her to pass the rest of the night with the women and me in their parlour and to stay till near One She told  me at parting that she expected to have the whole next day to herselfI had not read the extracts then so was all affectionate respect awe and distance for I had resolved to begin a new course and if possible to banish all jealousy and suspicion from her heart And yet I had no reason to be much troubled at her past suspicions since if a woman will continue with a man whom she suspects when she can get from him or  thinks  she can I am sure it is a very hopeful sign  SHE is gone Slipt down before I was aware She had ordered a chair on purpose to exclude my personal attendance But I had taken proper precautions Will attended her by consent Peter the houseservant was within Will's call  I had by Dorcas represented her danger from Singleton in order to dissuade her from going at all unless she allowed me to attend her but I was answer'd That if there was no cause of fear at the playhouse when there were but  two  playhouses surely there was less at church when there were so  many  churches The chairmen were ordered to carry her to St James's church  But she would not be so careless of obliging me if she knew what I have already come at and how the women urge me on for they are continually complaining of the restraint they lie under in their behaviour in their attendance neglecting all their concerns in the fronthouse and keeping this elegant back one intirely free from company that she may have no suspicion of them They doubt not my generosity they say But  why  for my own sake in Lord M's style  should I make so long a harvest of so little corn  Women ye reason well I think I will begin my operations the moment she comes in  I HAVE come at the letter brought her from Miss Howe todayPlot conjuration sorcery witchcraft all going forwardI shall not be able to see this  Miss Harlowe  with patience As the nymphs below say Why is  night  necessaryAnd Sally and Polly upbraidingly remind me of my first attempts upon themselvesYet force answers not my endAnd yet it may if there be truth in that part of the libertines creed  That once subdued is always subdued  And what woman answers  affirmatively  to the question  SHE is returnedBut refuses to admit me Desires to have the day to herself Dorcas tells me that she believes her denial is from motives of pietyOons Jack is there impiety in seeing meWould it not be the highest act of piety to reclaim me And is this to be done by her refusing to see me when she is in a devouter frame than usual But I hate her hate her heartilyShe is old ugly and deformedBut O the blasphemyYet she is an HarloweAnd I hate her for that  But since I must not see her She will be mistress of her  own will  and of her  time  truly let me fill up mine by telling thee what I have come at  The first letter the women met with is dated April  See Vol  III  Letter  lxii  p    Where can she have put the preceding ones It mentions Mr Hickman as a busy fellow between them Hickman had best take care of himself She says in it  I hope you have no cause to repent returning my NorrisIt is forthcoming on demand  Now what the devil can this meanHer Norris forthcoming on demandThe devil take me if I am  outNorris'd  If such innocents can allow themselves to plot to  Norris  well may I  She is sorry that  her Hannah can't be with her  And what if she couldWhat could Hannah do for her in such a house as this  The women in the house are to be found out in one breakfasting  The women are enraged at both the correspondents for this and more than ever make a point of conquering her I had a good mind to give them Miss Howe in full property Say but the word Jack and it shall be done  She is glad that Miss Harlowe had thoughts of takeing me at my word She wondered I did not offer again  Advises her if I don't soon  not to stay with me  Cautions her  to keep me at distance not to permit the least familiarity  See JackSee BelfordExactly as I thoughtHer vigilance all owing to a cool friend who can sit down quietly and give that advice which in her own case she could not takeShe tells her  it is my interest to be honest  INTEREST foolsI thought these girls knew that my  interest  was ever subservient to my  pleasure    What would I give to come at the copies of the letters to which those of Miss Howe are answers  The next letter is dated May  See Vol  III  Letter  lxix  p    In this the little termagant expresses her astonishment that her mother should write to Miss Harlowe to forbid her to correspond with her daughter Mr Hickman she says is of opinion  that she ought not to obey her mother  How the creeping fellow trims between both I am afraid that I must punish him as well as this virago and I have a scheme rumbling in my head that wants but half an hour's musing to bring into form that will do my business upon both I cannot bear that the parental authority should be thus despised thus trampled underfootBut observe the vixen  'Tis well he is of her opinion for her mother having set her up she must have somebody to quarrel with  Could a Lovelace have allowed himself a greater licence This  girl's a devilish rake in her heart Had she been a man and one of us she'd have outdone us all in enterprize and spirit  She wants but very little farther provocation  she says  to fly privately to London And if she does she will not leave her till she sees her either honourably married or quit of the wretch  Here Jack the transcriber Sally has added a prayer  'For the Lord's sake dear Mr Lovelace get this fury to London'  Her fate I can tell thee Jack if we had her among us should not be so long deciding as her friend's What a gantlope would she run when I had done with her among a dozen of her own pityless Sex whom my charmer shall never seeBut more of this anon  I find by this letter that my saucy captive had been drawing the characters of every varlet of ye Nor am I spared in it more than you  The man's a fool to be sure my dear  Let me die if they either of them find me one  A silly fellow at least  Cursed contemptible  I see not but they are a set of infernals  There's for thee Belford  and he the Beelzebub  There's for thee LovelaceAnd yet she would have her friend marry a BeelzebubAnd what have any of us done to the knowlege of Miss Harlowe that she should give such an account of us as should warrant so much abuse from Miss HoweBut that's to come  She blames her for  not admitting Miss Partington to her bedWatchful as you are what could have happen'dIf violence were intended he would not stay for the night  Sally writes upon this hint  'See Sir what is expected from you An hundred and an hundred times have we told you of this'  And so they have But to be sure the advice from them was not of half the efficacy as it will be from Miss Howe  You might have sat up after her or not gone to bed  But can there be such apprehensions between them yet the one advise her to stay and the other  resolve to wait my imperial motion for marriage I am glad I know that  She approves of my proposal about Mrs Fretchville's house She puts her upon expecting settlements upon naming a day And concludes with insisting upon her writing notwithstanding her mother's prohibition or bids her  take the consequence  Undutiful wretches  Thou wilt say to thyself by this time And can this proud and insolent girl be the same Miss Howe who sighed for honest Sir George Colmar and who but for this her beloved friend would have followed him in all his broken fortunes when he was obliged to quit the kingdom  Yes she is the very same And I always found in others as well as in myself that a first passion thoroughly subdued made the conqueror of it a rover the conqueress a tyrant  Well but now comes mincing in a letter from one who has  the honour of dear Miss Howe's commands  See Vol  III  Letter  lxxi  p    to acquaint Miss Harlowe that Miss Howe is  excessively concerned for the concern she has given her    I have great temptations on this occasion  says the prim Gothamite  to express my own resentments upon your present state    My own resentments  And why did he not fall into this  temptation  Why truly because he knew not what that state was which gave him so  tempting  a subject  Only by conjecture  and so forth  He then dances in his style as he does in his gaite To be sure to be sure he must have made the grand tour and come home by the way of Tipperary  And being moreover forbid  says the prancer  to enter into the cruel subject  This prohibition was a mercy to thee friend HickmanBut why  cruel subject  if thou knowest not what it is but  conjecturest  only from the disturbance it gives to a girl that is her  mother's disturbance will be thy disturbance and the disturbance in turn of everybody with whom she is intimately acquainted unless I have the humbling of her  In another letter  Letter  iv  p    of this Vol    She approves of her design to leave me if she can be received by her friends    Has heard some strange stories of me that shew me to be the worst of men Had I a dozen lives I might have forfeited them all twenty crimes ago  An odd way of reckoning Jack  Miss Betterton Miss Lockyer are named  The man  so she irreverently calls me she says  is a villain  Let me perish if I am called a villain for nothingShe  will have her uncle  as Miss Harlowe desires  sounded about receiving her Dorcas is to be attach'd to her interest My letters are to be come at by surprize or trick  See Jack  She is alarmed at my attempt to come at a letter of hers  Were I to come at the knowlege of her freedoms with my character  she says  she should be afraid to stir out without a guard  I would advise the vixen to get her guard ready  I am at the head of a gang of wretches  Thee Jack and thy brother varlets she owns she means  who join together to betray innocent creatures and to support one another in their villainies  What sayest thou to this Belford  She wonders not at her melancholy reflections for meeting me for being forced upon me and tricked by me  I hope Jack thou'lt have done preaching after this  But she comforts her  that she will be both a warning and example to all her Sex  I hope the Sex will thank me for this  The nymphs had not time they say to transcribe all that was worthy of my resentment in this letter  So I must find an opportunity to come at it myself Noble rant they say it containsBut I am a  seducer  and a hundred vile fellows in it  And the devil  it seems  took possession of my heart and of the hearts of all her friends in the same dark hour in order to provoke her to meet me  Again  There is a fate in her error  she saysWhy then should she grieve  Adversity is her shiningtime  and I cannot tell whatYet never to thank the man to whom she owes the  shine  In the next  Letter  x  p    Wicked as I am  she fears I must be her lord and master  I hope so  She retracts what she said against me in her lastMy behaviour to my Rosebud Miss Harlowe to take possession of Mrs Fretchville's house I to stay at Mrs Sinclair's the stake I have in my country my reversions my oeconomy my person my address all are brought in my favour to induce her now  not  to leave me How do I love to puzzle these  long  sighted girls  Yet  my teazing ways  it seems  are intolerable  Are women only to teaze I trowThe Sex may thank themselves for learning me to outteaze them So the headstrong Charles XII of Sweden learned the Czar Peter to beat him by continuing a war with the Muscovites against the antient maxims of his kingdom  May eternal vengeance  PURSUE  the villain  Thank heaven she does not say  overtake if he give room to doubt his honour  Women can't swear JackSweet souls they can only curse  I am said  to doubt her love  Have I not reason And she  to doubt my ardor  Ardor JackWhy 'tis very rightWomen as Miss Howe says and as every Rake knows love ardors  She apprizes her of the  ill success of the application made to her uncle  By Hickman no doubtI must  have this fellow's ears in my pocket very quickly believe  She says  She is equally shocked and enraged against all her family Mrs Norton's weight has been try'd upon Mrs Harlowe as well as Mr Hickman's upon the uncle But never were there  says the vixen  such determin'd brutes in the world Her uncle concludes her ruin'd already  Is not that a call upon me as well as a reproach  They all expected applications from her when in distressbut were resolved not to stir an inch to save her life  She was  accused of premeditation and contrivance  Miss Howe is  concerned  she tells her  for the revenge my pride may put me upon taking for the distance she has kept me at  And well she may  She has now but one choice  for her cousin Morden it seems is set against her too  and that's to be mine  An act of necessity of convenienceThy friend Jack to be already made a woman's convenienceIs this to be borne by a Lovelace  I shall make great use of this letter From Miss Howe's hints of what passed between her uncle Harlowe and Hickman It must be Hickman I can give room for my  invention  to play for she tells her that  she will not reveal all  I must endeavour to come at this letter myself I must have the very words extracts will not do This letter when I have it must be my compass to steer by  The fire of friendship then blazes out and crackles I never before imagin'd that so fervent a friendship could subsist between two sisterbeauties both toasts But even here it may be inflamed by opposition and by that contradiction which gives spirit to female spirits of a warm and romantic turn  She raves about  coming up if by so doing she could prevent so noble a creature from stooping too low or save her from ruin  One reed to support another These girls are frenzical in their friendship They know not what a steady fire is  How comes it to pass that I cannot help being pleased with this virago's spirit tho' I suffer by it Had I her but here I'd engage in a week's time to teach her submission without reserve What pleasure should I have in breaking such a spirit I should wish for her but for one month in all I think She would be too tame and spiritless for me after that How sweetly pretty to see the two lovely friends when humbled and tame both sitting in the darkest corner of a room arm in arm weeping and sobbing for each otherAnd I their emperor their then  acknowleged  emperor reclined on a sophee in the same room Grand Signor like uncertain to which I should first throw out my handkerchief  Mind the girl  She is enraged at the Harlowes  She  is angry at her own mother she is exasperated against her foolish and lowvanity'd Lovelace  FOOLISH a little toad God forgive me for calling a virtuous girl a toad  Let us stoop to lift the wretch out of his dirt tho' we soil our fingers in doing it He has not been guilty of direct indecency to you  It seems  extraordinary  to Miss Howe that I have not  Nor dare he  She should be sure of that If women have such things in their heads why should not I in my heart  Not so much of a devil as that comes to neither Such villainous intentions would have shewn themselves before now if I had them  Lord help them  She then puts her friend upon urging for  settlements licence  and so forth  No room for delicacy now  she saysAnd tells her what she shall say to  bring all forward from me  Dost think Jack that I should not have carried my point long ago but for this vixenShe  reproaches her for having  MODESTY'D  away  as she calls it  more than one opportunity that she ought not to have slipt  Thus thou seest that the noblest of the Sex mean nothing in the world by their shyness and distance but to pound a poor fellow whom they dislike not when he comes into their pur  ieus  Annexed to this letter is a paper the most saucy that ever was wrote of a mother by a daughter There are in it such free reflections upon widows and batchelors that I cannot but wonder how Miss Howe came by her learning Sir George Colmar I can tell thee was a greater fool than thy friend if she had it all for nothing  The contents of this paper acquaints Miss Harlowe that her uncle Antony has been making proposals of marriage to her mother The old fellow's heart ought to be a tough one if he succeed or she who broke that of a much worthier man the late Mr Howe will soon get rid of him But be this as it may the stupid family is more irreconcileable than ever to their goddessdaughter for old Antony's thoughts of marrying So I am more secure of her than ever since as Miss Howe says  she can have but one choice now  Though this disgusts my pride yet I believe at last my tender heart will be moved in her favour For I did not wish that she should have nothing but persecution and distressBut why loves she the  brutes  as Miss Howe justly calls them so much me so littleBut I have still more unpardonable transcripts from other letters  LETTER XXV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  THE next letter is of such a nature that I dare say these proud varletesses would not have had it fall into my hands for the world  Letter  xv  p      I see by it to what her displeasure with me in relation to my proposals was owing They were not summ'd up it seems with the warmth with the  ardor  which she had expected This whole letter was transcribed by Dorcas to whose lot it fell Thou shalt have copies of them all at full length shortly  Men of our cast  this little devil says  she fancies cannot have the ardors that honest men have  Miss Howe has very pretty fancies Jack Charming girl Would to heaven I knew whether my fairone answers her as freely as she writes 'Twould vex a man's heart that this virago should have come honestly by her  fancies    Who knows but I may have half a dozen creatures to get off my hands before I engage for life  Yet lest this should mean me a compliment as if I would reform she adds her belief  that she must not expect me to be honest on this side my grand climacteric  She has an high opinion of her Sex to think they can charm so long with a man so well acquainted with their  identicalness    He to suggest delays  she says  from a compliment to be made to Lord M  Yes  I  my dearBecause a man has not been accustomed to be dutiful must he never be dutifulIn so important a case as this too the hearts of his whole family engaged in it  You did indeed  says she  want an interposing friendBut were I to have been in your situation I would have tore his eyes out and left it to his own heart to furnish the reason for it  See See What sayest thou to this Jack  VillainFellow that he is  follow And for what Only for wishing that the next day were to be my happy one and for being dutiful to my nearest relation  It is the cru  llest of fates  she says  for a woman to be forced to have a man whom her heart despises  That is what I wanted to be sure ofI was afraid that my beloved was too conscious of her talents of her superiorityI was afraid that she  indeed  despised me and I cannot bear it But Belford I do not intend that this lady shall be bound down by so cruel a fate Let me perish if I marry a woman who has given her most intimate friend reason to say she despises meA Lovelace to be despised Jack  His clench'd fist to his forehead on your leaving him in just displeasure  that is when she was not satisfied with my ardors and please yeI remember the motion But her back was toward me at the time Are these watchful ladies all eyeBut observe her wish  I wish it had been a pollax and in the hands of his worst enemy  I  will  have patience Jack I  will  have patience My day is at handThen will I steel my heart with these remembrances  But here is a scheme to be thought of in order to  get my fair prize out of my hands in case I give her reason to suspect me    This indeed alarms me Now the contention becomes arduous Now wilt thou not wonder if I let loose my plotting genius upon them both I will not be  outNorris'd  Belford  But once more  she has no notion  she says  that I can or dare to mean her dishonour  But  then the man is a foolthat's all  I should indeed be a fool to proceed as I do and mean matrimony  However since you are thrown upon a fool  says she  marry the fool at the first opportunity and tho' I doubt that this man will be the most unmanageable of fools as all witty and vain fools are take him as a punishment since you cannot as a reward  Is there any bearing this Belford  But in the letter I came at today while she was at church her scheme is further opened and a cursed one it is  Mr Lovelace then transcribes from his shorthand notes that part of Miss Howe's letter which relates to the design of engaging Mrs Townsend in case of necessity to give her protection till Colonel Morden comes  Letter  xxii  p    And repeats his vows of revenge especially for those words  that should he attempt any thing that would make him obnoxious to the laws of society she might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows no matter which    He then adds  'Tis my pride to subdue girls who know  too much  to  doubt  their knowlege and to convince them that they know  too little  to defend themselves from the inconveniencies of knowing  too much    How passion drives a man on I have written as thou'lt see a prodigious quantity in a very few hours Now my resentments are warm I will see and perhaps will punish this proud this  double  arm'd beauty I have sent to tell her that I must be admitted to sup with her We have neither of us dined She refused to drink tea in the afternoonAnd I believe neither of us will have much stomach to our supper  LETTER XXVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday morning    May    I Was at the play last night with Mr Lovelace and Miss Horton It is you know a deep and most affecting tragedy in the reading You have my remarks upon it in the little book you made me write upon the principal acting plays You will not wonder that Miss Horton as well as I was greatly moved at the representation when I tell you and have some pleasure in telling you that Mr Lovelace himself was very sensibly touched with some of the most affecting scenes I mention this in praise of the author's performance for I take Mr Lovelace to be one of the most hardhearted men in the world Upon my word my dear I do  His behaviour however on this occasion and on our return was unexceptionable only that he would oblige me to stay to supper with the women be  ow when we came back and to sit up with him  nd them till near one o'clock this morning I was resolved to be even with him and indeed I am not  very sorry to have the pretence for I love to pass the Sundays by myself  To have the better excuse to avoid his teazing I am ready dressed to go to church this morning I will go only to St James's church and in a  chair  that I may be sure I can go out and come in when I please without being obtruded upon by him as I was twice before  Near nine o'clock  I HAVE your kind letter of yesterday He knows I have And I shall expect that he will be inquisitive next time I see him after your opinion of his proposals I doubted not your approbation of them and had written an answer on that presumption which is ready for him He must study for occasions of procrastination and to disoblige me if now any thing happens to set us at variance again  He is very importunate to see me he has desired to attend me to church He is angry that I have declined to breakfast with him I was sure that I should not be at my own liberty if I hadI bid Dorcas tell him that I desired to have this day to myself I would see him in the morning as early as he pleased She says she knows not what ails him but that he is out of humour with everybody  He has sent again in a peremptory manner He warns me of Singleton But surely I sent him word if he was not afraid of Singleton at the playhouse last night I need not at church to day So many churches to one playhouseI have accepted of his servant's proposed attendanceBut he is quite displeased it seems I don't care I will not be perpetually at his insolent beckAdieu my dear til  I return The chair waits He won't stop me sure as I go down to it  I DID not see him as I went down He is i  seems excessively out of humour Dorcas says N  with me neither she believes But something has vex'd him This is put on perhaps to make me dine with him But I won't if I can help it I shan't get rid of him for the rest of the day if I do  HE was very earnest to dine with me But I was resolved to carry this one small point and so denied to dine myself And indeed I was endeavouring to write to my cousin Morden and had begun three different letters without being able to please myself so uncertain and so unpleasing is my situation  He was very busy in writing Dorcas says and pursued it without dining because I denied him my company  He afterwards  demanded  as I may say to be admitted to afternoon tea with me And appealed by Dorcas to his behaviour to me last night as if as I sent him word by her he thought he had a merit in being unexceptionable However I repeated my promise to meet him as early as he pleased in the morning or to breakfast with him  Dorcas says he raved I heard him loud and I heard his servant fly from him as I thought You my dearest friend say in one of yours  Vol  III  Letter  lxix  p    that you must have somebody to be angry at when your mother sets you upI should be very loth to draw comparisonsBut the workings of passion when indulg'd are but too much alike whether in man or woman  HE has just sent me word that he insists upon supping with me As we had been in a good train for several days past I thought it not prudent to break with him for little matters Yet to be in a manner threaten'd into his will I know not how to bear that  WHILE I was considering he came up and tapping at my door told me in a very angry tone he must see  me this night He could not rest till he had been told what he had done to deserve this treatment  I must go to him Yet perhaps he has nothing new to say to meI shall be very angry with him  As the Lady could not know what Mr Lovelace's designs were nor the cause of his ill humour it will not be improper to pursue the subject from his letter  Having described his angry manner of demanding in person her company at supper he proceeds as follows  'Tis hard answered the fair Perverse that I am to be so little my own mistress I will meet you in the diningroom half an hour hence  I went down to wait that halfhour All the women set me hard to give her cause for this tyranny They demonstrated as well from the nature of the  sex  as of the  case  that I had nothing to hope for from my tameness and could meet with no worse treatment were I to be guilty of the last offence They urged me vehemently to  try  at least what effect some greater familiarities than I had ever used with her would have And their arguments being strengthened by my just resentments on the discoveries I had made I was resolved to take some liberties and as they were received to take still greater and lay all the fault upon her tyranny In this humour I went up and never had paralytic so little command of his joints as I had as I walked about the diningroom attending her motions  With an erect mien she enter'd her face averted her lovely bosom swelling and the more charmingly protuberant for the erectness of her mien O Jack that sullenness and reserve should give this haughty maid new charms But in every attitude in every humour in every gesture is beauty beautifulBy her averted face and indignant aspect I saw the dear insolent was  disposed to be angryBut by the fierceness of mine as my trembling hands seized hers I soon made fear her predominant passion And yet the moment I beheld her my heart was dastardiz'd damp'd and reverencedover Surely this is an angel JackAnd yet had she not been known to be a female they would not from  babyhood  have dressed her as such nor would she but upon that conviction have continued the dress  Let me ask you Madam I beseech you tell me what I have done to deserve this distant treatment  And let me ask you Mr Lovelace why are my retirements to be thus invadedWhat can you have to say to me since last night that I went with you so much against my will to the play And after sitting up with you equally against my will till a very late hour  This I have to say Madam that I cannot bear to be kept at this distance from you under the same roof I have a thousand things to say to talk of relating to our present and future prospects but when I want  o open my whole soul to you you are always con  riving to keep me at a distance you make me inconsistent with myself your heart is set upon delays you must have views that you will not own Tell me Madam I conjure you to tell me this moment without subterfuge or reserve in what light am I to appear to you in future I cannot bear this distance  he suspense you hold me in I cannot bear  In what light Mr Lovelace In no bad light I hopePray Mr Lovelace do not grasp my hands  o hard endeavouring to withdraw her hands Pray  et me go  You hate me Madam  I hate nobody Sir  You  hate  me Madam repeated I  Instigated and resolved as I came up I wanted  ome new provocation The devil indeed as soon as  my angel made her appearance crept out of my heart but he had left the door open and was no farther off than my elbow  You come up in no good temper I see Mr LovelaceBut pray be not violentI have done you no hurtPray be not violent  Sweet creature And I clasped one arm about her holding one hand in my other  You have done me no hurt  You have done me the greatest hurtIn what have I deserved the distance you keep me atI knew not what to say  She struggled to disengage herselfPray Mr Lovelace let me withdraw I know not why this isI know not what I have done to offend you I see you are come with a design to quarrel with me If you would not terrify me by the illhumour you are in permit me to withdraw I will hear all you have to say another timeTomorrow morning as I sent you word but indeed you frighten meI beseech you if you have any value for me permit me to withdraw  Night  mid  night  is  necessary Belford Surprize terror  must  be necessary to the ultimate trial of this charming creature say the women below what they willI could not hold my purposesThis was no  the first time that I had  intended  to try if she could forgive  I kissed her hand with a fervor as if I would hav  left my lips upon itWithdraw then dearest an  everdear creatureIndeed I enter'd in a very  humour I cannot bear the distance you so causle  keep me atWithdraw however Madam since  is your will to withdraw and judge me generously judge me but as I deserve to be judged and let m  hope to meet you tomorrow morning early in suc  a temper as becomes our present situation and m  future hopes And so saying I conducted her to th  door and left her there But instead of going dow  to the women went into my own chamber and locked myself in ashamed of being awed by her ma  estic loveliness and apprehensive virtue into so great a change of purpose notwithstanding I had such just provocations from the letters of her saucy friend founded on her own representations of facts and situations between herself and me  The Lady thus describes her terrors and Mr Lovelace's behaviour on this occasion  On my entering the diningroom he took my hands in his in such a humour as I saw plainly he was resolved to quarrel with me  And for what    never in my life beheld in anybody such a wild such an angry such an impatient spirit I was ter  ified and instead of being as angry as I intended to  e I was forced to be all mildness I can hardly remember what were his first words I was so frighted But  You hate me Madam You hate me Madam  were some of themwith such a fiercenessI wish'd myself a thousand miles distant from him I hate no  ody said I I thank God I hate nobodyYou ter  ify me Mr LovelaceLet me leave youThe man my dear looked quite uglyI never saw a man  ook so ugly as passion made him look  And for what  And he so grasped my handsfierce creature He so grasped my hands In short he  eemed by his looks and by his words once putting  is arms about me to wish me to provoke himSo that I had nothing to do but to beg of him which  did repeatedly to permit me to withdraw and to promise to meet him at his own time in the morning  It was with a very ill grace that he complied on  hat condition and at parting he kissed my hand with  uch a savageness that a redness remains upon it  till  Perfect for me my dearest Miss Howe perfect for me I beseech you your kind scheme with Mrs  TownsendAnd I will then leave this man See you not how from step to step he grows upon meI tremble to look back upon his incroachments And now to give me cause to apprehend more evil from him than indignation will permit me to expressO my dear perfect your scheme and let me fly from so strange a wretch He must certainly have views in quarrelling with me thus which he dare not own Yet what can they be  I WAS so disgusted with him as well as frighted by him that on my return to my chamber in a fit of passionate despair I tore almost in two the answer I had written to his proposals  I will see him in the morning because I promised I would But I will go out and that without him or any attendant If he account not tolerably for his sudden change of behaviour and a proper opportunity offer of a private lodging in some creditable house I will not any more return to thisAt present I think soAnd there will I either attend the perfecting of your scheme or by your epistolary mediation make my own terms with the wretch since it is your opinion that I must be his and cannot help myself Or perhaps take a resolution to throw myself at once into Lady Betty's protection and this will hinder him from making his insolentlythreatned visit to HarlowePlace  The Lady writes again on Monday evening and gives her friend an account of all that has passed between herself and Mr Lovelace that day and of her being terrified out of her purpose of going abroad But Mr Lovelace's next letters giving a more ample account of all hers are omitted  It is proper however to mention that she reurges Miss Howe from the dissatisfaction she has reason for from what passed between Mr Lovelace  and herself to perfect her scheme in relation to Mrs Townsend  She concludes this letter in these words  'I should say something of your last favour but a few hours ago received and of your dialogue with your motherAre you not very whimsical my dearI have but two things to wish for on this occasion The one that your charming pleasantry had a better subject than that you find for it in this dialogue The other that my situation were not such as must too often damp that pleasantry and will not permit me to enjoy it as I used to do Be however happy in yourself tho' you cannot in  '  Your  CLARISSA HARLOWE'  LETTER XXVII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday Morn May    NO generosity in this lady None at all Wouldst thou not have thought that after I had permitted her to withdraw primed for mischief as I was that she would meet me next morning early and that with a smile making me one of her best courtesies  I was in the diningroom before six expecting her She opened not her door I went upstairs and down and hemm'd and called Will called Dorcas Threw the doors hard to but still she opened not her door Thus till half an hour after eight fooled I away my time and then breakfast ready I sent Dorcas to request her company  But I was astonished when following the wench at the first invitation I saw her enter dressed all but her gloves and those and her fan in her hand in the  same moment bidding Dorcas direct Will to get her a chair to the door  Cruel creature thought I to expose me thus to the derision of the women below  Going abroad Madam  I am Sir  I looked cursed silly I am sureYou will breakfast first I hope Madam in a very humble strain Yet with an hundred tenterhooks in my heart  Had she given me more notice of her intention I had perhaps wrought myself up to the frame I was in the day before and begun my vengeance And immediately came into my head all the virulence that had been transcribed for me from Miss Howe's letters and in that I had transcribed myself  Yes she would drink one dish and then laid her gloves and fan in the window just by  I was perfectly disconcerted I hemm'd and haw'd and was going to speak several times but knew not in what key Who's modest now thought I Who's insolent nowHow a tyrant of a woman confounds a bashful manShe was my Miss Howe I thought and I the spiritless Hickman  At last I  will  begin thought I  She a dishI a dish  Sip her eyes her own she like an haughty and imperious sovereign conscious of dignity every look a favour  Sip like her vassal I lips and hands trembling and not knowing that I sipp'd or tasted  I wasI wasIffp'ddrawing in my breath and the liquor together tho' I scalded my mouth with itI was in hopes Madam  Dorcas came in just thenDorcas said she is a chair gone for  Damn'd impertinence thought I putting me out of my speech And I was forced to wait for the servant's answer to the insolent mistress's question  William is gone for one Madam  This cost me a minute's silence before I could begin againAnd then it was with my hopes and my hopes and my hopes that I should have been early admitted to  What weather is it Dorcas said she as regardless of me as if I had not been present  A little lowering MadamThe sun is gone inIt was very fine half an hour ago  I had no patienceUp I rose Down went the teacup saucer and allConfound the weather the sunshine and the wenchBegone for a devil when I am speaking to your lady and have so little opportunity given me  Up rose the lady half frighted and snatched from the window her gloves and fan  You must not go MadamBy my soul you must notTaking her hand  Must not  SirBut I mustYou can curse your maid in my absence as well as if I were presentExceptExceptyou intend for  me  what you direct to  her    Dearest creature you must not goYou must not leave meSuch determined scorn Such contemptsQuestions ask'd your servant of no meaning but to break in upon me who couldbear it  Detain me not strugglingI will not be withh  ldI like you not nor your waysYou sought to quarrel with me yesterday for no reason in the world that I can think of but because I was too obliging You are an ingrateful man and I hate you with my whole heart Mr Lovelace  Do not make me desperate MadamPermit me to say that you shall not leave me in this humour Whereever you go I will attend youHad Miss Howe been my friend I had not been thus treatedIt is but too plain to whom my difficulties are owing I have long observed that every letter you receive  from her makes an alteration in your behaviour to me She would have  you  treat  me  as  she  treats Mr Hickman I suppose But neither does that treatment become your admirable temper to offer nor me to receive  This startled her She did not care to have me think hardly of Miss Howe  But recollecting herself Miss Howe said she is a friend to virtue and to good menIf she like not you it is because you are not one of those  Yes Madam and therefore to speak of Mr Hickman and Myself as you both I suppose think of each she treats  him  as she would not treat a  Lovelace  I challenge you Madam to shew me but one of the many letters you have received from her where I am mentioned  Whither will this lead us replied she Miss Howe is just Miss Howe is goodShe writes she speaks of everybody as they deserve If you point me out but any one occasion upon which you have reason to build a merit to yourself as either just or good or even generous I will look out for her letter on that occasion if it be one I have acquainted her with and will engage it shall be in your favour  Devilish severe And as indelicate as severe to put a modest man upon hunting backward after his own merits  She would have flung from me I  will  go out Mr Lovelace I will  not  be detained  Indeed you must not Madam in this humour And I placed myself between her and the doorAnd then she threw herself into a chair fanning herself her sweet face all crimsoned over with passion  I cast myself at her feetBegone Mr Lovelace said she with a rejecting motion her fan in her hand for your own sake leave meMy soul is above thee man With both her hands pushing me from herUrge me not to tell thee how sincerely I think my soul above theeThou hast a proud a too proud  heart to contend withLeave me and leave me for everThou hast a proud heart to contend with  Her air her manner her voice were bewitchingly noble tho' her words were so severe  Let me worship an angel said I no woman Forgive me dearest creatureCreature if you be forgive meForgive my inadvertencies Forgive my inequalitiesPity my infirmityWho is equal to my Clarissa  I trembled between admiration and love and wrapt my arms about her knees as she sat She try'd to rise at the moment but my clasping round her thus ardently drew her down again and never was woman more affrighted But free as my clasping emotion might appear to her apprehensive heart I had not at the instant any thought but what reverence inspired And till she had actually withdrawn which I permitted under promise of a speedy return and on her consent to dismiss the chair all the motions of my heart were as pure as her own  She kept not her word An hour I waited before I sent to claim her promise She could not possibly see me yet was the answer As soon as she could she would  Dorcas says she still excessively trembled and ordered her to give her water and hartshorn  A strange apprehensive creatureHer terror is too great for the occasionEvils in apprehension are often greater than evils in reality Hast thou never observed that the terrors of a bird caught and actually in the hand bear no comparison to what we might have supposed those terrors would be were we to have formed a judgment of the same bird by its shyness before taken  Dear creatureDid she never romp Did she never from girlhood to now hoyden The  innocent  kinds of freedom taken and all owed on these occasions would have familiarized her to greater Sacrilege  but to touch the hem of her garmentExcess of delicacyO the consecrated beautyHow can she think to be a wife  But how do I know till I try whether she may not by a less alarming treatment be prevailed upon or whether Day I have done with thee she may not yield to nightly surprizes This is still the burden of my song I can marry her when I will And if I do after prevailing whether by surprize or reluctant consent whom but myself shall I have injured  IT is now eleven o'clock She will see me as soon as she can she tells Polly Horton who made her a tender visit and to whom she is less reserved than to anybody else Her emotion she assures her was not owing to perverseness to nicety to illhumour but to  weakness of heart  She has not  strength of mind  sufficient she says to enable her to support her condition and her apprehensions under the weight of a father's curse which she fears is more than beginning to operate  Yet what a contradiction  Weakness of heart  says she with such a  strength of will  O Belford she is a lionhearted lady in every case where her honour her punctilio rather calls for spirit But I have had reason more than once in her case to conclude that the passions of the gentlest slower to be moved than those of the quick are the most flaming the most irresistible when raisedYet her charming body is not equally organized The unequal partners pull two ways and the divinity within her tears her silken frame But had the same soul informed a masculine body never would there have been a truer hero  Monday two o'clock  MY beloved not yet visible She is not well What  expectations  had she from my ardent admiration  of herMore rudeness than revenge apprehended Yet how my soul thirsts for revenge upon both these ladiesI must have recourse to my masterstrokes This cursed project of Miss Howe and her Mrs Townsend if I cannot contrive to render it abortive will be always a sword hanging over my head Upon every little disobligation my beloved will be for taking wing and the pains I have taken to deprive her of every other refuge or protection in order to make her absolutely dependent upon me will be all thrown away But perhaps I shall find out a Smuggler to counteract Miss Howe  Thou remembrest the contention between the Sun and the North wind in the fable which should first make an honest Traveller throw off his cloak  Boreas began first He puffed away most vehemently and often made the poor fellow curve and stagger But with no other effect than to cause him to wrap his surtout the closer about him  But when it came to Phoebus's turn he so played upon the traveller with his beams that he made him first unbutton and then throw it quite offNor left he till he obliged him to take to the friendly shade of a spreading beech where prostrating himself on the thrownoff cloak he took a comfortable nap  The victorgod then laughed outright both at Boreas and the Traveller and pursued his radiant course shining upon and warming and cherishing a thousand new objects as he danced along And at night when he put up his fiery coursers he diverted his Thetis with the relation of his pranks in the passed day  I in like manner will discard all my boistrous inventions and if I can oblige my sweet Traveller to throw aside but for one moment the cloak of her rigid virtue I shall have nothing to do but like the Sun to bless new objects with my raysBut my chosen hours of conversation and repose after all my peregrinations will be devoted to my goddess  AND now Belford according to my new system I think this house of Mrs Fretchville an embarass upon me I will get rid of it for some time at least Mennell when I am out shall come to her inquiring for me What for thou'lt ask What forHast thou not heard what has befallen poor Mrs FretchvilleThen I'll tell thee  One of her maids about a week ago was taken with the smallpox The restkept their mistress ignorant of it till Friday and  then  she came to know it by accidentThe greater half of the plagues poor mortals of condition are tormented with proceed from the servants they take partly for shew partly for use and with a view to lessen their cares  This has so terrified the widow that she is taken with all the symptoms which threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair facesSo must not think of removing Yet cannot expect that we should be further delayed on her account  She now wishes with all her heart that she had known her own mind and gone into the country at first when I treated about the house This evil then had not happenedA cursed cross accident for  us  tooHighho Nothing else I think in this mortal lifePeople need not study to bring crosses upon themselves by their petulancies  So this affair of the house will be over at least for one while But then I can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this disappointment Since I must move  slow  in order to be  sure  I have a charming contrivance or two in my headEven supposing she should get away to bring her back again  But what is become of Lord M I trow that he writes not to me in answer to my invitation If he would send me such a letter as I could shew it might go a great way towards a perfect reconciliation I have written to Charlotte about it He shall soon  hear from me and that in a way he won't like if he writes not quickly He has sometimes threatened to disinherit  me  But if I should renounce  him  it would be but justice and would vex him ten times more than any thing he can do will vex me Then the settlements unavoidably delayed by his neglectHow shall I bear such a life of procrastination I who as to my will and impatience and so forth am of the true  ladymake  and can as little bear controul and disappointment as the best of them  ANOTHER letter from Miss Howe I suppose it is  that  which she promises in her last to send her relateing to the courtship between old Tony the uncle and Annabella the mother I should be extremely rejoiced to see it No more of the smugglerplot in it I hope This it seems she has put in her pocket But I hope I shall soon find it deposited with the rest  Monday evening  AT my repeated request she condescended to meet me in the diningroom to afternoon tea and not before  She entered with bashfulness as I thought in a pretty confusion for having carried her apprehensions too far Sullen and slow moved she towards the teatableDorcas present busy in tea cup preparations I took her reluctant hand and pressed it to my lipsDearest loveliest of creatures why this distance Why this displeasureHow can you thus torture the faithfullest heart in the worldShe disengaged her hand Again I would have snatch'd it  Be quiet peevishly withdrawing it and down she sat a gentle palpitation in the beauty of beauties indicating mingled sullenness and resentment her snowy handkerchief rising and falling and a sweet flush overspreading her charming cheeks  For God's sake MadamAnd a third time I would have taken her repulsing hand  And for the same sake Sir no more teazing  Dorcas retired I drew my chair nearer hers and with the most respectful tenderness took her hand and told her that I could not without the utmost concern forbear to express my apprehensions from the distance she was so desirous to keep me at that if any man in the world was more  indifferent  to her to use no harsher a word than another it was the unhappy wretch before her  She looked steadily upon me for a moment and with her other hand not withdrawing that I held pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket and by a twinkling motion tried to dissipate a tear or two which stood ready in each eye to meander themselves a passage down her glowing cheeks but answered me only with a sigh and an averted face  I urged her to speak to look up at me to bless me with an eye more favourable  I had reason she told me for my complaint of her indifference She saw nothing in my mind that was generous I was not a man to be obliged or favoured My strange behaviour to her since Saturday night for no cause at all that she knew of convinced her of this Whatever hopes she had conceived of me were utterly dissipated All my ways were disgustful to her  This cut me to the heart The guilty I believe in every case less patiently bear the detecting truth than the innocent do the degrading falshood  I bespoke her patience while I took the liberty to account for this change on my partI reacknowleged the pride of my heart which could not bear the thought of that want of preference in the heart of a lady whom I hoped to call mine which she had always manifested Marriage I said was a state that  was not to be entered upon with indifference on either side  It is insolence interrupted she it is presumption Sir to expect tokens of value without resolving to  deserve  them You have no whining creature before you Mr Lovelace overcome by weak motives to love where there is no merit Miss Howe can tell you Sir that I never loved the  faults  of my friend nor ever wished her to love me for mine It was a rule with us not to spare each other And would a man who has nothing but faults for pray Sir what are your virtues expect that I should shew a value for him Indeed if I did I should not deserve even  his  value but ought to be despised by him  Well have you Madam kept up to this noble manner of thinking You are in no danger of being despised for any marks of tenderness or favour shewn to the man before you You have been perhaps  you'll  think  laudably  studious of making and taking occasions to declare that it was far from being owing to your choice that you had any thoughts of me My whole soul Madam in all its errors in all its wishes in all its views had been laid open and naked before you had I been encouraged by such a share in your confidence and esteem as would have secured me against your apprehended worst constructions of what I should from time to time have revealed to you and consulted you upon For never was there a franker heart nor a man so ready to accuse himself This Belford is true But you know Madam how much otherwise it has been between usDoubt distance reserve on your part begat doubt fear awe on mineHow little confidence as if we apprehended each other to be a plotter rather than a lover How have I dreaded every letter that has been brought you from Wilson'sAnd with reason since the last  from which I expected so much on account of th  proposals I had made you in writing has if I may judge by the effects and by your denial of seeing me yesterday tho' you could go abroad and in a  chai  too to avoid my attendance on you set you against me more than ever  I was guilty it seems of going to church said the indignant charmer and without the company of a man whose choice it would not have been to go had I not gone I was guilty of desiring to have the whole Sunday to myself after I had obliged you against my will at a play and after you had detained me equally to my dislike to a very late hour over nightThese were my faults For these I was to be punished I was to be compelled to see you and to be terrified when I did see you by the most shocking illhumour that was ever shewn to a creature in my circumstances and not bound to bear it You have pretended to find free fault with my father's temper Mr Lovelace But the worst that he ever shewed  after  marriage was not in the least to be compared to what you have shewn twenty times  beforehand  And what are my prospects with you at the very bestMy indignation rises against you Mr Lovelace while I speak to you when I recollect the many instances equally ungenerous and unpolite of your behaviour to one whom you have brought into distressAnd I can hardly bear you in my sight  She turned from me standing up and lifting up her folded hands and charming eyes swimming in tearsO my dear papa said the inimitable creature you might have spared your heavy curse had you known how I have been punished ever since my swerving feet led me out of your gardendoors to meet this man Then sinking into her chair a burst of passionate tears forced their way down her glowing cheeks  My dearest life taking her still folded hands in mine who can bear an invocation so affecting tho' so passionate And as I hope to live my nose tingled as I once when a boy remember it did and indeed once more very lately just before some tears came into my eyes and I durst hardly trust my face in view of hers What have I done to deserve this impatient exclamationHave I at any time by word by deeds by looks given you cause to doubt my honour my reverence my  adoration  I may call it of your virtuesAll is owing to misapprehension I hope on both sidesCondescend to clear up but your part as I will mine and all must speedily be happyWould to heaven I loved that heaven as I love you And yet if I doubted a return in love let me perish if I should know how to wish you mineGive me hope dearest creature give me but hope that I am your preferable choiceGive me but hope that you hate me not that you do not despise me  O Mr Lovelace we have been long enough together to be tired of each others humours and ways ways and humours so different that perhaps you ought to dislike  me  as much as I do  you  I think I think that I cannot make an answerable return to the value you profess for me My temper is utterly ruined You have given me an ill opinion of all mankind of yourself in particular And withal so bad a one of myself that I shall never be able to look up having utterly and for ever lost all that selfcomplacency and conscious pride which are so necessary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable satisfaction to herself  She paused I was silent By my soul thought I this sweet creature will at last undo me  She proceededWhat now remains but that you pronounce me free of all obligation to you And that you will not hinder me from pursuing the destiny that shall be allotted me  Again she paused I was still silent meditating whether to renounce all further designs upon her whether I had not received sufficient evidence of a virtue and of a greatness of soul that could not be questioned or impeached  She went on Propitious to me be your silence Mr LovelaceTell me that I am free of all obligation to you You know I never made  you  promisesYou know that you are not under any to  me  My broken fortunes I matter not  She was proceedingMy dearest life said I I have been all this time tho' you fill me with doubts of your favour busy in the nuptial preparationsI am actually in treaty for equipage  Equipage  SirTrappings TinselWhat is Equipage what is Life what is Anything to a creature sunk so low as I am in my own opinionLabouring under a father's curseUnable to look backward without reproach or forward without terrorThese reflections strengthen'd by every cross accidentAnd what but cross accidents befal meAll my darling schemes dashed in pieces all my hopes at an end deny me not the liberty to refuge myself in some obscure corner where neither the enemies you have made me nor the few friends you have left me may ever hear of the supposed rash one till those happy moments are at hand which shall expiate for all  I had not a word to say for myself Such a war in my mind had I never known Gratitude and admiration of the excellent creature before me combating with villainous habit with resolutions so premeditately made and with views so much gloried inAn hundred new contrivances in my head and in my heart that to be honest as it is called must all be given up by a heart delighting in intrigue and difficultyMiss Howe's virulences endeavoured to be recollectedYet recollection refusing to bring them forward with the requisite efficacyI had certainly  been a lost man had not Dorcas come seasonably in with a letterOn the superscription written  Be pleased Sir to open it now    I returned to the windowopened itIt was from herselfThese the contents  'Be pleased to detain my lady a paper of importance to transcribeI will cough when I have done'  I put the paper in my pocket and turned to my charmer less disconcerted as she by that time had also a little recovered herselfOne favour dearest creatureLet me but know whether Miss Howe approves or disapproves of my proposalsI know her to be my enemy I was intending to account to you for the change of behaviour you accused me of at the beginning of this conversation but was diverted from it by your vehemenceIndeed my beloved creature you was  very  vehementDo you think it must not be matter of high regret to me to find my wishes so often delayed and postponed in favour of your predominant view to a reconciliation with relations who will not be reconciled to youTo this was owing your declining to celebrate before we came to town tho' you were so atrociously treated by your sister and your whole family and tho' so ardently pressed to celebrate by me To this was owing the ready offence you took at my four friends and at the unavailing attempt I made to see a dropt letter little imagining that there could be room for mortal displeasure on that account from what two such ladies could write to each otherTo this was owing the week's distance you held me at till you knew the issue of another applicationBut when they had rejected that when you had sent my coldlyreceived proposals to Miss Howe for her approbation or advice as indeed I advised and had honoured me with your company at the play on Saturday night my whole behaviour unobjectible to the last hour must not Madam the sudden change in your conduct the very  next morning astonish and distress meAnd this persisted in with still stronger declarations after you had received the impatientlyexpected letter from Miss Howe must I not conclude that all was owing to her influence and that some other application or project was meditating that made it necessary to keep me again at distance till the result were known and which was to deprive me of you for ever for was not that your constantly proposed preliminaryWell Madam might I be wrought up to a halffrenzy by this apprehension and well might I charge you with hating meAnd now dearest creature let me know I once more ask you what is Miss Howe's opinion of my proposals  Were I disposed to debate with you Mr Lovelace I could very easily answer your fine harangue But at present I shall only say that your ways have been very unaccountable You seem to me if your meanings were always just to have taken great pains to embarass them Whether owing in you to the want of a clear head or a sound heart I cannot determine but it is to the want of one of them I verily think that I am to ascribe the greatest part of your strange conduct  Curse upon the heart of the little devil said I who instigates you to think so hardly of the faithfullest heart in the world  How dare you SirAnd there she stopt having almost overshot herself as I designed she should  How dare I  what  Madam And I looked with meaning How dare I  what  Vile manAnd do youAnd there again she stopt  Do I  what  MadamAnd why  vile man  How dare you to curse  anybody  in my presence  O the sweet recederBut that was not to go off so with a Lovelace  Why then dearest creature is there  anybody  that instigates youIf there be again I curse them be they who they will  She was in a charming pretty passionAnd this was the first time that I had the odds in my favour  Well Madam it is just as I thought And now I know how to account for a temper that I hope is not  natural  to you  Artful wretch And is it thus you would entrap meBut know Sir that I receive letters from nobody but Miss Howe Miss Howe likes some of your ways as little as I do for I have set everything before herYet she is thus far  your  enemy as she is  mine  She thinks I should not refuse your offers but endeavour to make the best of my lot And now you have the truth Would to heaven you were capable of dealing with equal sincerity  I  am  Madam And here on my knee I renew my vows and my supplication that you will make me yoursYours for everAnd let me have cause to bless you and Miss Howe in the same breath  To say the truth Belford I had before begun to think that that vixen of a girl who certainly likes not Hickman was in love with  me    Rise Sir from your tooready knees and mock me not  Tooready knees  thought ITho' this humble posture so little affects this proud beauty she knows not how much I have obtained of others of her sex nor how often I have been forgiven the last attempts by kneeling  Mock you  MadamAnd I arose and reurged her for the day I blamed myself at the same time for my invitation to Lord M as it might subject me to delay from his infirmities But told her that I would write to him to excuse me if she had no objection or to give him the day she would give me and not wait for him if he could not come in time  My day Sir said she is never Be not surprized▪ A person of politeness judging between us would not be surprized that I say so But indeed Mr Lovelace and wept thro' impatience you either know not how to treat with a mind of the least degree of delicacy notwithstanding your birth and education or you are an ingrateful man and after a pause a worse than ingrateful one But I will retire I will see you again tomorrow I cannot before I think I hate youYou may lookIndeed I think I hate you And if upon a reexamination of my own heart I find I do I would not for the world that matters should go on farther between us  I was too much vex'd disconcerted mortify'd to hinder her retiringAnd yet she had not gone if Dorcas had not cough'd  The wench came in as soon as her lady had retired and gave me the copy she had taken And what should it be of but the answer the truly admirable creature had intended to give to my written proposals in relation to settlements  I have but just dipt into this affecting paper Were I to read it attentively not a wink should I sleep this night Tomorrow it shall obtain my serious consideration  LETTER XXVIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Morning May    THE dear creature desires to be excused seeing me till evening She is not very well Dorcas tells me  Read here if thou wilt the paper transcribed by Dorcas It is impossible that I should proceed with my projects against this admirable woman were it not that I am resolved after a few trials more as  nobly sustained as those she has already passed through to make her if she really hate me not legally mine  To Mr  LOVELACE    'WHEN a woman is married that supreme earthly obligation requires her in all instances of natural justice and where her husband's honour may be concerned to yield her own will to hisBut beforehand I could be glad conformably to what I have always signified to have the most explicit assurances that every possible way should be tried to avoid litigation with my father Time and patience will subdue all things My prospects of happiness are extremely contracted A husband's right will be always the same In my lifetime I could wish nothing to be done of this sort Your circumstances Sir will not oblige you to extort violently from him what is in his hands All that depends upon  me  either with regard to my person to my diversions or to the oeconomy that no married woman of whatever rank or quality should be above inspecting shall be done to prevent a necessity for such measures being taken And if there will be no  necessity  for them it is to be hoped that motives  less  excusable will not have forceMotives which must be founded in a littleness of mind which a woman who has  not  that littleness of mind will be under such temptations as her duty will hardly be able at all times to check to despise her husband for having especially in cases where her own family so much a part of herself and which will have obligations upon her tho' then but  secondary  ones from which she never can be freed are intimately concerned'  'This article then I urge to your most serious consideration as what lies next my heart I enter not here minutely into the fatal misunderstanding between them and you The fault may be in both But Sir  yours  was the foundationfault At least  you gave a too plausible pretence for my brother's antipathy to work upon Condescension was no part of your study You chose to bear the imputations laid to your charge rather than to make it your endeavour to obviate them'  'But this may lead into hateful recriminationLet it be remembred I will only say in this place that in  their  eye you have robbed them of a daughter they doted upon and that their resentments on this occasion rise but in proportion to their love and their disappointment If they were faulty in some of the measures they took while they themselves did not think so who shall judge for  them  You Sir who will judge everybody as you please and will let nobody judge you in  your own  particular must not be their judgeIt may therefore be expected that they will stand out'  'As for  myself  Sir I must leave it so seems it to be destined to your justice to treat me as you shall think I deserve But if your future behaviour to  them  is not governed by that harshsounding implacableness which you charge upon some of their tempers the splendor of your family and the excellent character of  some  of them of  all  indeed except your own conscience furnishes you with one  only  exception will on better consideration do every thing with them For they  may  be overcome perhaps however with the more difficulty as the greatly prosperous less bear controul and disappointment than others For I will own to you that I have often in secret lamented that their great acquirements have been a snare to them perhaps as great a snare as some  other  accidentals have been to you which being less immediately your own gifts you have still less reason than they to value yourself upon them'  'Let me only on this subject further observe that condescension is not meanness There is a glory  in yielding that hardly any violent spirit can judge of My brother perhaps is no more sensible of  this  than you But as you have talents he has not who however has as I hope that regard for morals the want of which makes one of his objections to you I could wish it may not be owing to  you  that your mutual dislikes to each other do not subside for it is my earnest hope that in time you may see each other without exciting the fears of a wife and a sister for the consequence Not that I should wish you to yield in points that truly concerned your honour No Sir I would be as delicate in such as you yourself  More  delicate I will venture to say because more  uniformly  so How vain how contemptible is that pride which shews itself in standing upon diminutive observances and gives up and makes a jest of the most important'  'This article being considered as I wish all the rest will be easy Were I to accept of the handsome separate provision you seem to intend me added to the considerable sums arisen from my grandfather's estate since his death more considerable than perhaps you may suppose from your offer I should think it my duty to lay up for the family good and for unforeseen events out of it For as to my donations I would generally confine myself in them to the tenth of my income be it what it would I aim at no glare in what I do of that sort All I wish for is the power of relieving the lame the blind the sick and the industrious poor whom accident has made so or sudden distress reduced The common or bred beggars I leave to others and to the public provision They cannot be lower Perhaps they wish not to be higher And not able to do for every one I aim not at works of supererogation Two hundred pounds a year would do all I wish to do of the separate sort For all above I would content myself to ask you except mistrusting your  own oeconomy you would give up to my management and keeping in order to provide for future contingencies a larger portion for which as your steward I would regularly account'  'As to cloaths I have particularly two suits which having been only in a manner try'd on would answer for any

personals that they will when I send for them in another name Till when I should not choose to wear any'  'As to your complaints of my diffidences and the like I appeal to your own heart if it be

married one  And a  wife  to be in a passionLet me tell th  ladies it is a dn'd impudent thing begging the pardon and as  imprudent  as impudent for a  wife  be in a passion if she mean not eternal separation  wicked defiance by it For is it not rejecting at once all that expostulatory meekness and gentle reasoning mingled with sighs as gentle and graced with bent knees supplicating hands and eyes lifted up to your imperial countenance just running over that should make a reconciliation speedy and as lasting as speedy Even suppose the husband is wrong will not his being so give the greater force to her expostulation  Now I think of it a man  should  be wrong nowandthen to make his wife shine Miss Howe tells my charmer that adversity is  her  shiningtime 'Tis a generous thing in a man to make his wife shine at his own expence To give her leave to triumph over him by patient reasoning For were he to be too  imperial  to acknowlege his fault on the spot she will find the benefit of her duty and submission  in future  and in the high opinion he will conceive of her prudence and obligingnessAnd so by degrees she will be her master's master  But for a wife to come up with a kemboed arm

husband  Dorcas found this paper in one of the drawers of her  ady's dressingtable She was reperusing it as she  upposes when the honest wench carried my message  o desire her to favour me at the teatable for she  saw her pop a paper into the drawer as she came in and there on her mistress's going to meet me in the diningroom she found it And to be This  But I had better not to have had a copy of it as far as I know For determined as I was before upon my operations it instantly turned all my resolutions in her favour Yet I would give something to be convinced that she did not pop it into her drawer before the wench in order for me to see it and perhaps if I were to take notice of it to discover whether Dorcas according to Miss Howe's advice were most  my  friend or  hers    The very suspicion of this will do her no good For I cannot bear to be artfully treated People love to enjoy their own peculiar talents in  monopoly  as I may say I am aware that it will strengthen thy arguments against me in her behalf But I know every tittle thou canst say upon it So spare thy wambling nonsense I desire thee and leave this sweet excellence and me to our fate That will determine for us as it shall please itself For as Cowley says  An unseen hand makes all our moves  And some are great and some are small  Some climb to good some from good fortune fall  Some wise men and some fools we call  Figures alas of speechFor destiny plays us all  But after all I am sorry  almost  sorry for how shall I do to be  quite  sorry when it is not  given  to me to be so that I cannot without making any further trials resolve upon wedlock  I have just read over again this intended answer to my proposals And how I adore her for it  But yet another  Yet  She has not given it o  sent it to meSo it is not  her  answer It is not written  for  me tho'  to  me  Nay she has not  intended  to send it to me Sh  has even torn it perhaps with indignation as think+ing  it too  good  for me By this action she absolutely retracts it Why then does my foolish fondness seek to establish for her the same merit in my heart as if she avowed it Prythee dear Belford once more leave us to our fate and do not thou interpose with thy nonsense to weaken a spirit already too squeamish and strengthen a conscience that has declared itself of her party  Then again remember thy recent discoveries LovelaceRemember her indifference attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred View her even  now  wrapt up in reserve and mystery meditating plots as far as thou knowest against the sovereignty thou hast by right of conquest obtained over her Remember in short all thou hast  threatened  to remember against this insolent beauty who is a rebel to the power she has listed under  But yet how dost thou propose to subdue thy sweet enemyAbhorr'd be  force  be the  necessity  of force if that can be avoided There is no triumph in  force  No conquest over the willNo prevailing by gentle degrees over the gentle passions  Force  is the devil  My cursed character as I have often said was against me at setting outYet is she not a  woman  Cannot I find one but halfyielding moment if she do not absolutely hate me  But with what can I tempt herRICHES she was born to and despises knowing what they are JEWELS and ornaments to a mind so much a jewel and so richly set her worthy consciousness will not let her value LOVE if she be susceptible of Love it seems to be so much under the direction of prudence that one unguarded moment I fear cannot be reasonably hoped for And so much VIGILANCE so much Apprehensiveness that her fears are ever aforehand with her dangers Then her LOVE OF VIRTUE seems to be  principle  native or if  not  native so deeply rooted that  its fibres have struck into her heart and as she grew up so blended and twisted themselves with the strings of life that I doubt there is no separating of the one without cutting the others asunder  What then can be done to make such a matchless creature as this get over the first tests in order to put her to the grand proof whether once overcome she will not be always overcome  By my faith Jack as I sit gazing upon her my whole soul in my eyes contemplating her perfections and thinking when I have seen her easy and serene what would be her thoughts did  she  know my heart as well as  I  know it when I behold her disturbed and jealous how  just  her apprehensions and that she cannot fear so much as there is  room  for her to fear my heart often misgives me  And must think I O creature so divinely excellent and so beloved of my soul those arms those incircling arms that would make a monarch happy be used to repel brutal force all their strength unavailingly perhaps exerted to repel it and to defend a person so delicately framed Can violence enter into the heart of a wretch who might intitle himself to all thy willing yet virtuous love and make the blessings thou aspirest after her  duty  to conferBegone villainpurposesSink ye all to the hell that could only inspire yeAnd I am ready to throw myself at her feet confess my villainous designs avow my repentance and put it out of my power to act unworthily by such a peerless excellence  How then comes it that all these compassionate and as some would call them  honest  sensibilities go offWhy Miss Howe will tell thee She says I am the  devil  By my conscience I think he has at present a great share in me  There's ingenuityHow I lay myself open to theeBut seest thou not that the more I say against myself the less room there is for thee to take me to  taskO Belford Belford I cannot cannot at least at present I cannot marry  Then her family my bitter enemiesTo supple to them or if I do not to make her  as  unhappy as she can be from my  attempts    Then must she love Them too much Me too little  She now seems to despise me Miss Howe declares that she really does despise me To be  despised by a  WIFEWhat a thought is thatTo be  excelled by a  WIFE too in every part of praiseworthy knowlegeTo  take lessons  to  take instructions  from a WIFE  More  than despise me she herself has taken time to consider whether she does not  hate  me  I hate you  Lovelace  with my whole heart  said she to me but yesterday  My soul is above thee manUrge me not to tell thee how sincerely I think my soul above thee  How poor indeed was I then even in my own heartSo  visible  a superiority to so proud a spirit as mineAnd  here  from Below from BELOW indeed I am so goaded on  Yet 'tis poor too to think myself a machineI am  no  machineLovelace thou art base to thyself but to  suppose  thyself a machine  But having gone thus far I should be unhappy if after marriage in the petulance of ill humour I had it to reproach myself that I did not try her to the utmost And yet I don't know how it is but this lady the moment I come into her presence half assimilates me to her own virtueOnce or twice to say nothing of her triumph over me on Sunday night I was prevailed upon to fluster myself with an intention to make some advances which if obliged to recede I might lay upon raised spirits But the instant I beheld her I was soberized into awe and reverence And the majesty of her even  visible  purity first damped and then extinguished my  double  flame  What a surprisingly powerful effect so much and so  long in my power  she  so instigated by some of her own sex and so stimulated by passion  I  How can this be accounted for in a Lovelace  But what a heap of stuff have I writtenHow have I been run away withBy whatCanst thou say by whatO thou lurking varletess CONSCIENCEIs it Thou that hast thus made me of party against myselfHow camest thou inIn what disguise thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hoursStand  thou  with  fate  but neuter in this controversy and if I cannot do credit to human nature and to the female sex by bringing down such an angel as this to class with and adorn it for adorn it she does in her very foibles then I am all yours and never will resist you more  Here I arose I shook myself The window was open Away the troublesome bosomvisiter the intruder is flownI see it yetI see it yetAnd now it lessens to my aching eyeAnd now the cleft air has closed after it and it is out of sightAnd once more I am  ROBERT LOVELACE  LETTER XXIX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday May    WELL did I and but just in time conclude to have done with Mrs Fretchville and the house For here Mennell has declar'd that he cannot in conscience and honour go any fartherHe would not for the world be accessory to the deceiving of such a LadyI was a fool to let either you or him see her for ever  since  ye have both had scruples which neither would have had were a  woman  to have been in the question  Well I can't help it  He has however tho' with some reluctance consented to write me a letter provided I will allow it to he the last step he shall take in this affair  I presumed I told him that if I could make Mrs Fretchville's  woman  supply his place he would have no objection to that  None  he says  But is it not pity    A pitiful fellow Such a ridiculous kind of pity  his  as those silly souls have who would not kill an innocent chicken for the world but when killed to their hands are always the most greedy devourers of it  Now this letter gives the servant the smallpox And she has given it to her unhappy vapourish lady Vapourish people are perpetual subjects for diseases to work upon  Name  but the malady and it is  theirs  in a moment  Ever  fitted for inoculationThe physical tribe's milchcowsA vapourish or sple  netic patient is a fiddle for the doctors and they are eternally playing upon it Sweet music does it make them All their difficulty except a case extraordinary happens as poor Mrs Fretchville's who has  realized  her apprehensions is but to hold their countenance while their patient is drawing up a bill of indictment against himselfand when they have heard it proceed to  punish  The right word for  prescribe  Why should they not when the criminal has confessed his guiltAnd  punish  they generally do with a vengeance  Yet silly toads too now I think of it For why when they know they cannot do good may they not as well endeavour to gratify as to nauseate the patient's palate  Were I a physician I'd get all the trade to myself For Malmsey and Cyprus and the generous products of the Cape a little disguised should be my principal doses As these would create new spirits  how would the revived patient covet the physic and adore the doctor  Give all the paraders of the faculty whom thou knowest this hintThere could but one inconvenience arise from it The APOTHECARIES would find their medicines cost them  something  But the demand for quantities would answer that Since the honest NURSE would be the patient's taster perpetually requiring repetitions of the last cordial julap  Well but to the letterYet what need of further explanation after the hints in my former The widow cannot be removed and that's enough And Mennell's work is over and his conscience left to plague him for his own sins and not another man's And very possibly plague enough will it give him for those  This letter is directed  To Robert Lovelace  Esq  or in his absence To his Lady  She had refused dining with me or seeing me and I was out when it came She open'd it So is my lady by her own consent proud and saucy as she is  I am glad at my heart that it came before we intirely make up She would else perhaps have concluded it to be contrived for a delay And now moreover we can accommodate our old and new quarrels together and that's contrivance you know But how is her dear haughty heart humbled to what it was when I knew her first that she can apprehend  any  delays from me and have nothing to do but to vex at them  I came in to dinner She sent me down the letter desiring my excuse for opening it Did it before she was aware LadyPride BelfordRecollection then Retrogradation  I requested to see her upon it that moment But she desires to suspend our interview till morning I will bring her to own before I have done with her that she can't see me too often  My impatience was so great on an occasion so  unexpected  that I could not help writing to tell her  'how much vex'd I was at the accident But that it need not delay my happy day as That did not depend upon the house She knew That before she'll think and so did I And as Mrs Fretchville by Mr Mennell so handsomely expressed her concern upon it and her wishes that it could suit us to bear with the unavoidable delay I hoped that going down to The Lawn for two or three of the summermonths when I was made the happiest of men would be favourable to all round'  The dear creature takes this incident to heart I believe And sends word to my repeated request to see her notwithstanding her denial that she cannot till the morning It shall be then at six o'clock if I please  To be sure I  do  please  Can see her but once a day now Jack  Did I tell thee that I wrote a letter to my cousin Montague wondering that I heard not from Lord M as the subject was so very interesting In it I acquainted her with the house I was about taking and with Mrs Fretchville's vapourish delays  I was very loth to engage my own family either man or woman in this affair but I must take my measures securely And already they all think as bad of me as they well can You observe by my Lord M's to yourself that the wellmanner'd Peer is afraid I should play this admirable creature one of my  usual dog's tricks    I have received just now an answer from Charlotte  Charlotte i'n't well A stomachdisorder  No wonder a girl's stomach should plague her A single lady that's it When she has a man to plague it will have something besides itself to prey upon Knowest thou not moreover that man is the woman's  Sun woman is the man's EarthHow dreary how desolate the Earth that is deprived of the allsalubriating Sunshine  Poor Charlotte But I  heard  she was not well That encouraged me to write to her and to express myself a little concerned that she had not of her own accord thought of a visit in town to my charmer  Here follows a copy of her letter Thou wilt see by it that every little monkey is to catechise me They all depend upon my goodnature  M Hall  May    Dear Cousin  WE have been in daily hope for a long time I must call it of hearing that the happy knot was ty'd My Lord has been very much out of order And yet nothing would serve him but he would himself write an answer to your letter It was the only opportunity he should ever have perhaps to throw in a little good advice to you with the hope of its being of any signification and he has been several hours in a day as his gout would let him busied in it It wants now only his last revisal He hopes it will have the greater weight with you if it appear all in his own handwriting  Indeed Mr Lovelace his worthy heart is wrapt up in you I wish you loved yourself but half as well But I believe too that if all the family loved you less you would love yourself more  His Lordship has been very busy at the times he could not write in consulting Pritchard about those estates which he proposes to transfer to you on the happy occasion that he may answer your letter in the most acceptable manner and shew by effects how kindly he takes your invitation I assure you he is mighty proud of it  As for myself I am not at all well and have not been for some weeks past with my old stomachdisorder I had certainly else before now have done  myself the honour you wonder I have  not  done myself My aunt Lawrance who would have accompanied me for we had laid it all out has been exceedingly busy in her lawaffair her antagonist who is actually on the spot having been making proposals for an accommodation But you may assure yourself that when our dear relationelect shall be enter'd upon the new habitation you tell me of we will do ourselves the honour of visiting her and if any delay arises from the dear lady's want of courage which considering her man let me tell you may very well be we will endeavour to inspire her with it and be sponsors for youfor cousin I believe you have need to be christen'd over again before you are intitled to so great a blessing What think you  Just now my Lord tells me he will dispatch a man on purpose with his letter tomorrow So I need not have written But now I have let it go and by Empson who sets out directly on his return to town  My best compliments and sister's to the most deserving Lady in the world You will need no other direction to the person meant conclude me  Your affectionate Cousin and Servant  CHARL MONTAGUE  THOU seest how seasonably this letter comes I hope my Lord will write nothing but what I may shew my beloved I have actually sent her up this letter of Charlotte's and hope for happy effects from it  THE Lady in her next letter gives Miss Howe an account of what has passed between Mr Lovelace and herself She resents his behaviour with her usual dignity But when she comes to mention Mr Men+nell's letter she reurges Miss Howe to perfect her scheme for her deliverance being resolved to leave  him But dating again on his sending up to her Miss Montague's letter she alters her mind and desires her to suspend for the present her application to Mrs Townsend  'I had begun says she to suspect all he had said of Mrs Fretchville and her house and even Mr Mennell himself though so well appearing a man But now that I find Mr Lovelace had apprized his relations of his intention to take it and had engaged some of the Ladies to visit me there I could hardly forbear blaming myself for censuring him as capable of so vile an imposture But may he not thank himself for acting so very unaccountably and taking such needleslywry steps as he has done embarassing as I told him his own meanings if they were good'  LETTER XXX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wednesd May    He gives his friend an account of their interview that morning and of the happy effects of his cousin Montague's letter in his favour Her reserves however he tells him are not absolutely banished But this he imputes to form  IT is  not  in the power of woman  says he  to be altogether sincere on these occasions But whyDo they think it so great a disgrace to be found out to be really what they  are  I regretted the illness of Mrs Fretchville as the intention I had to fix her dear self in the house before the happy knot was tied would have set her in that independence in  appearance  as well as  fact  which was necessary to shew to all the world that her choice was free and  as  the ladies of my family would have been proud to make their court to her there while  the settlements and our equipages were preparing But on any other account there was no great matter in it since when my happy day was over we could with so much convenience go down to the Lawn or to my Lord M's or to either of my aunts in town which would give full time to provide ourselves with servants and other accommodations  How sweetly the charmer listen'd  I asked her If she had had the smallpox  'Twas always a doubtful point with her mother and Mrs Norton she own'd But altho' she was not afraid of it she chose not unnecessarily to rush into places where it was  Right thought I  Else I said it would not have been amiss for her to see the house before she went into the country for if  she  liked it not I was not obliged to have it  She asked If she might take a copy of Miss Montague's letter  I said She might keep the letter itself and send it to Miss Howe if she pleased for that I supposed was her intention She bow'd her head to me There JackI shall have her courtesy to me byandby I question not What adevil had I to do to terrify the sweet creature by my termagant projectsYet it was not amiss I believe to make her afraid of me She  says  I am an unpolite manAnd every polite instance from such a one is deem'd a favour  Talking of the settlements I told her that I had rather Pritchard mentioned by my cousin Charlotte had not been consulted on this occasion Pritchard indeed was a very honest man and had been for a generation in the family and knew the estates and the condition of them better than either my Lord or myself But Pritchard like other old men was diffident and slow and valued himself upon his skill as a draughtsman and for the sake of that paltry reputation  must have all his forms preserved were an imperial crown to depend upon his dispatch  I kissed her unrepulsing hand no less than five times during this conversation Lord Jack how my generous heart run overShe was quite obliging at partingShe in a manner asked me  leave  to retire to reperuse Charlotte's letterI think she bent her knees to me but I won't be sureHow happy might we have both been long ago had the dear creature been always as complaisant to me For I do love respect and whether I deserved it or not always had it till I knew this proud beauty  And now Belford are we in a train or the duce is in it Every fortified town has its strong and its weak place I had carried on my attacks against the impregnable parts I have no doubt but I shall either  shine  or  smuggle  her out of her cloak since she and Miss Howe have intended to employ a smuggler against  me  All we wait for now is my Lord's letter  But I had like to have  forgot  to tell thee that we have been not a little alarm'd by some inquiries that have been made after me and my beloved by a man of good appearance who yesterday procured a tradesman in the neighbouroood to send for Dorcas Of whom he asked several questions relating to us and particularly as we boarded and lodged in one house whether we were married  This has given my beloved great uneasiness And I could not help observing upon it to her how right a thing it was that we had given out below that we were married The inquiry most probably I said was from her brother's quarter and now perhaps that our marriage was owned we should hear no more of his machinations The person it seems was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed But Dorcas refused to give him any other particulars than that we  were  married and was the more reserved as he declined to tell her the motives of his inquiry  LETTER XXXI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  May    THE devil take this uncle of mine He has at last sent me a letter which I cannot shew without exposing the head of our family for a fool A confounded parcel of popguns has he let off upon me I was in hopes he had exhausted his whole stock of this sort in his letter to youTo keep it back to delay sending it till he had recollected all this  farrago  of nonsenseConfound his  Wisdom of nations  if so much of it is to be scraped together in disgrace of itself to make one egregious simpletonBut I am glad I am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly however since in all human affairs the  convenient  and  inconvenient  the  good  and the  bad  are so mingled that there is no having the one without the other  I have already offer'd the bill inclosed in it to my beloved and read to her part of the letter But she refused the bill And I being in cash shall return it She seemed very desirous to peruse the whole letter And when I told her that were it not for exposing the writer I would oblige her she said It would not be exposing his Lordship to shew it to her and that she always preferred the heart to the head I knew her meaningBut did not thank her for it  All that makes for me in it I will transcribe for herYet hang it she shall have the letter and my soul with it for one consenting kiss  SHE has got the letter from me without the reward Duce take me if I had the courage to propose the condition A new character this of bashfulness in thy friendI see that a truly modest woman  may make even a confident man keep his distance By my soul Belford I believe that nine women in ten who fall fall either from their own vanity or levity or for want of circumspection and proper reserves  I DID intend to take my reward on her returning a letter so favourable to us both But she sent it to me sealed up by DorcasI might have thought that there were two or three hints in it that she would be too nice immediately to appear to I send it to thee and here will stop to give thee time to read it Return it as soon as thou hast perused it  LETTER XXXII Lord  M  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday May    IT is a long lane that has no turning  Do not despise me for my proverbsYou know I was always fond of them and if you had been so too it would have been the better for you let me tell you I dare swear the fine lady you are so likely to be soon happy with will be far from despising them for I am told that she writes well and that all her letters are full of sentences God convert you for nobody but He and this lady can  I have no manner of doubt now but that you will marry as your father and all your ancestors did before you Else you would have had no title to be my heir nor can your descendents have any title to be yours unless they are legitimate that's worth your remembrance Sir  No man is always a fool every man sometimes  But your follies I hope are now at an end  I know you have vowed revenge against this fine lady's family But no more of that now You must  look upon them all as your relations and forgive and forget And when they see you make a good husband and a good father which God send for all our sakes they will wonder at their nonsensical antipathy and beg your pardon But while they think you a vile fellow and a rake how can they either love you or excuse their daughter  And methinks I could wish to give a word of comfort to the lady who doubtless must be under great fears how she shall be able to holdin such a wild creature as you have hitherto been I would hint to her that by strong arguments and gentle words she may do any thing with you for tho' you are too apt to be hot gentle words will cool you and bring you into the temper that is necessary for your cure  Would to God  my  poor lady your aunt who is dead and gone had been a proper patient for the same remedy God rest her soul No reflections upon her memory  Worth is best known by want  I know  hers  now and if I had went first she would by this time have known  mine    There is great wisdom in that saying  God send me a friend that may tell me of my faults If not an enemy and he will  Not that I am your enemy and that you know well  The more noble any one is the more humble  So bear with me if you would be thought nobleAm I not your uncle And do I not design to be better to you than your father could be Nay I will be your father too when the happy day comes since you desire it And pray make my compliments to my dear niece and tell her I wonder much that she has so long deferred your happiness  Pray let her know I will present HER not  you  either my Lancashire seat or  The Lawn  in Hertfordshire and settle upon her a thousand pounds a year penyrents to shew her that we are not a family to take base advantages And you may have  writings drawn and settle as you willHonest Pritchard has the rentroll of both these estates at his fingers end and has been a good old servant I recommend him to your Lady's favour I have already consulted him He will tell you what is best for you and most pleasing to me  I am still very bad with my gout but will come in a litter as soon as the day is fixed It would be the joy of my heart to join your hands And let me tell you if you do not make the best of husbands to so good a young lady and one who has had so much courage for your sake I will renounce you and settle all I can upon her and hers by you and leave you out of the question  If any thing be wanting for your further security I am ready to give it tho' you know that my word has always been look'd upon as my bond And when the Harlowes know all this let us see whether they are able to blush and take shame upon themselves  Your two aunts want only to know the day to make all the country round them blaze and all their tenants mad And if any one of mine be sober upon the occasion Pritchard shall eject him And on the birth of the first child if a son I will do something more for you and repeat all our rejoicings  I ought indeed to have written sooner But I knew that if you thought me long and were in haste as to your nuptials you would write and tell me so But my gout was very troublesome And I am but a slow writer you know at best For Composing is a thing that tho' formerly I was very ready at it as my Lord Lexington used to say yet having left it off a great while I am not so now And I chose on this occasion to write all out of my own head and memory and to give you my best advice for I may never have such an opportunity again You have had God mend you a strange way of turning your back upon all I have said This once I hope you  will be more attentive to the advice I give you for your own good  I had still another end nay two other ends  The one was That now you are upon the borders of wedlock as I may say and  all your wild cats will  e sown  I would give you some instructions as to your public as well as private behaviour in life which intending you so much good as I'do you ought to hear and perhaps would never have listen'd to on any less extraordinary occasion  The second is That your dear ladyelect who is it seems herself so fine and so sententious a writer will see by this that it is not our faults nor for want of the best advice that you was not a better man than you have hitherto been  And now in few words for the conduct I would wish you to follow in public as well as in private if you would think me worthy of advising It shall be short so be not uneasy  As to the  private  life Love your Lady as she deserves  Let your actions praise you  Be a good husband and so give the lye to all your enemies and make them asham'd of their scandals And let us have pride in saying that Miss Harlowe has not done either herself or family any discredit by coming among us Do this and I and your aunts will love you for ever  As to your  public  conductThis is what I could wish But I reckon your Lady's wisdom will put us both rightNo disparagement Sir since with all your wit you have not hitherto shewn much wisdom you know  Get into parliament as soon as you can For you have talents to make a great figure there Who so proper to assist in making new holding laws as those whom no law in being could hold  Then for so long as you will give attendance in St Stephen's chapelIts being called a chapel I hope  will not  disgust  you I am sure I have known many a riot thereA Speaker has a hard time of it But we  Peers  have more decorumBut what was I going to sayI must go back  For so long as you will give your attendance in parliament for so long will you be out of mischief out of  private  mischief at least And may St Stephen's fate be yours if you wilfully do  public  mischief  When a new election comes you will have two or three Boroughs you know to choose out ofBut if you stay till then I had rather you were for the Shire  You'll have interest enough I am sure and being so handsome a man the women will make their husbands vote for you  I shall long to read your speeches I expect you will speak if occasion offers the very first day You want no courage and think highly enough of yourself and lowly enough of everybody else to speak on all occasions  As to the methods of the house you have spirit enough I fear to be too much above them Take care of thatI don't so much fear your want of goodmanners To  men  you want no decency if they don't provoke you As to that I wish you'd only learn to be as patient of contradiction from others as you would have other people be to  you    Altho' I would not have you to be a Courtier neither would I have you be a Malecontent I remember for I have it down what my old friend Archibald Hutcheson said and it was a very good sayingto Mr Secretary Craggs I think it was  'I look upon an administration as intitled to every vote I can with good conscience give it for a House of Commons should not needlesly put drags upon the wheels of Government And when I have not given it my vote it was with regret And for my Country's sake I wish'd with all my heart the measure had been such as I could have approved'  And another saying he had which was this  'Neither can an Opposition neither can a Ministry be always wrong To be a plumb man therefore with either is an infallible mark that that man must mean more and worse than he will own he does mean'  Are these Sayings bad Sir Are they to be despisedWell then why should I be despised for remembering them and quoting them as I love to do Let me tell you if you loved my company more than you do you would not be the worse for it I may say so without any vanity since it is other mens wisdom and not my own that I am so fond of But to add a word or two more on this occasion and I may never have such another for you  must  read this thro'Love honest men and herd with them in the house and out of the house by whatever names they be dignified or distinguished  Keep good men company and you shall be of the number  But did I or did I not write this beforeWriting at so many different times and such a quantity one may forget  You may come in for the title when I am dead and goneGod help meSo I would have you keep an equilibrium If once you get the name of being a fine speaker you may have any thing And to be sure you have naturally a great deal of elocution a tongue that would delude an angel as the women say To their sorrow some of them poor creaturesA leading man in the House of Commons is a very important character because that house has the giving of money And  Money makes the mare to go  ay and Queens and Kings too sometimes to go in a manner very different from what they might otherwise choose to go let me tell you  However methinks I would not have you take a place neitherIt will double your value and your  interest if it be believed that you will not For you will then stand in no man's way you will ha  no envy but pure sterling respect and both sides w  court you  For your part you will not want a plac  as some others do to piece up their broken fortune If you can now live reputably upon two thousa  pounds a year it will be hard if you cannot hereaft  upon seven or eightLess you will not have if yo  oblige me as now by marrying so fine a lady  e  much you willAnd all this beside Lady Betty and Lady Sarah's favoursWhat in the name  wonder could possibly possess the proud Harlowes That Son that Son of theirsBut for his dear sister'  sake I will say no more of him  I never was offer'd a place myself And the on  one I would have taken had I been offer'd it wa  Master of the Buckhounds  for I loved hunting whe  I was young and it carries a good sound with it for us who live in the country Often have I though  of that excellent old adage  He that eats the King'  goose

'Tis payable  t sight as whatever else you may have occasion  or shall be  So God bless you both and make things as convenient to my gout as you can tho' be it whenever it will I will hobble to you for I long to see you and my niece full as much as you and am in expec  tion of that happy time  Your most affectionate Uncle  M  LETTER XXXIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Thursday May    THOU seest Belford how we now drive before the windThe dear creature now comes almost at the first word whenever I desire the honour of her company I told her last night that apprehending delay from Pritchard's slowness I was determined to  eave it to my Lord to make his compliments in his  wn way and had actually that afternoon put my writings into the hands of a very eminent lawyer Counsellor Williams with directions for him to draw  p settlements from my own estate and conformable  o those of my own mother which I put into his hands at the same time It had been I said no small part of my concern that her frequent displeasure and our mutual misapprehensions had hindered me from advising with her before on this subject Indeed  ndeed my dearest life said I you have hitherto afforded me but a very thorny courtship  She was silent  Kindly  silent For well know I that she could have recriminated upon me with a vengeanceBut I was willing to see if she were not  oth to disoblige me nowI comforted myself I  aid with the hopes that all my difficulties were over and that every past disobligation would now be  uried in oblivion  Now Belford I have actually deposited these writings with Counsellor Williams and I expect the draughts in a week at furthest So shall be doubly armed For if I attempt and fail these will be ready to throw in to make her have patience with me till I can try again  I have more contrivances still in embryo I could tell thee of an hundred and still hold another hundred in petto to pop in as I go along to excite thy surprize and to keep up thy attention Nor rave thou at me but if thou art my friend think of Miss Howe's letters and of her smuggling scheme All owing to my fair captive's informations and incitementsAm I not a  villain  a  fool  a  Beelzebub  with them alreadyYet no harm done by me nor so much as attempted  Every thing of this nature the dear creature answered with a downcast eye and a blushing cheek she left to me  I proposed my Lord's chapel for the celebration where we might have the presence of Lady Betty Lady Sarah and my two cousins Montague  She seemed not to favour a public celebration and waved this subject for the present I did suppose that she would not choose to be married in public any more than me So I pressed not this matter further just then  But patterns I actually produced and a jeweller was to bring as this day several sets of jewels for her choice But the patterns she would not open She sighed at the mention of them The second patterns she said that had been offered to her  See Vol  I  p    And very peremptorily forbid the jeweller's coming as well as declined my offer of getting my own mother's to be newset at least for the present  I do assure thee Belford I was in earnest in all this My whole estate is nothing to me put in competition with her hopedfor favour  She then told me that she had written her opinion of my general proposals and there had expressed her mind as to cloaths and jewelsBut on my behaviour to her for no cause that she knew of on Sunday night she had torn the paper in two I earnestly pressed her to let me be favoured with a sight of this paper torn as it was And after some hesitation she withdrew and sent it to me by Dorcas  I perused it again It was in a manner new to me tho' I had read it so lately and by my soul I could hardly stand it An hundred admirable creatures I called her to myselfBut I charge thee write not a word to me in her favour if thou meanest her well for if I spare her it must be all  ex mero motu    You may easily suppose when I was readmitted to her presence that I ran over in her praises and in vows of gratitude and everlasting love But here's the devil she still receives all I say with reserve or if it be not with reserve she receives it so much as her due that she is not at all raised by it Some women are undone by praise by flattery I myself am proud of praisePerhaps thou wilt say that those are most proud of it who least deserve itAs those are of riches and grandeur who are not born to either I own that it requires a soul to be superior to these foibles Have I not then a soulSurely I haveLet me then be consider'd as an exception to the rule  Now have I a foundation to go upon in my terms My Lord in the exuberance of his generosity mentions a thousand pounds a year penyrents  This  I know that were I to marry this Lady he would rather settle upon her all he has a mind to settle than upon me And has even threatened that if I prove not a good husband to her he will leave all he can at his death from me to herYet considers not that a woman so perfect can never be displeased with her husband but to  his  disgrace for who will blame  her  Another reason why a Lovelace should not wish to marry a CLARISSA  But what a pretty fellow of an uncle mine to think of making a wife independent of her emperor and a rebel of courseYet smarted himself for an error of this kind  My beloved in her torn paper mentions but two hundred pounds a year for her separate use I insisted upon her naming a larger sum She said it might then be three and I for fear she should suspect very large offers named five and the intire disposal of all arrears in her father's hands for the benefit of Mrs Norton or whom she pleased  She said that the good woman would be uneasy if any thing more than a competency were done for her She was for suiting all her dispositions of this kind she said to the usual way of life of the person To go beyond it was but to put the benefited upon projects or to make them aukward in a new state when they might shine in that they were accustomed to And to put it into so good a mother's power to give her son a beginning in his business at a proper time yet to leave her something for herself to set her above want or the necessity of taking back from her child what she had been enabled to bestow upon him would be the height of such a worthy parent's ambition  Here is prudence Here is judgment in so young a creature How do I hate the Harlowes for producing such an angelO why why did she refuse my sincere address to tie the knot before we came to this house  But yet what mortifies my pride is that this exalted creature if I were to marry her would not be governed in her behaviour to me by love but by generosity merely or by blind duty and had rather live single than be mine  I cannot bear this I would have the woman whom I honour with my name if ever I confer this honour  upon any forego even her superior duties for me I would have her look after me when I go out as far as she can see me as my Rosebud after her Johnny and meet me at my return with rapture I would be the subject of her dreams as well as of her waking thoughts I would have her look upon every moment lost that is not passed with me Sing to me read to me play to me when I pleased no joy so great as in obeying me When I should be inclined to love overwhelm me with it when to be serious or solitary if intrusive awfully so retiring at a nod approaching me only if I smiled encouragement Steal into my presence with silence out of it if not noticed on tiptoe Be a  Lady Easy  to all my pleasures and valuing those most who most contributed to them only sighing in private that it was not  herself  at the timeThus of old did the contending wives of the honest patriarchs each recommending her handmaid to her lord as she thought it would oblige him and looking upon the genial product as her own  The gentle Waller says  Women are born to be controul'd  Gentle as he was he knew that A tyranthusband makes a dutiful wife And why do the Sex love rakes but because they know how to direct their uncertain wills and manage them  ANOTHER agreeable conversation The day of days the subject As to fixing a particular one that need not be done till the settlements are completed As to marrying at my Lord's chapel the ladies of my family present that would be making a public affair of it and my charmer observed with regret that it seemed to be my Lord's intention to make it so  It could not be imagined I said but that his Lordship's setting out in a litter and coming to town as well as his taste for glare and the joy he would take to see me married at last would give it as much the  air of a public marriage as if the ceremony were performed at his own chapel all the ladies present  She could not bear the thoughts of a public day It would carry with it an air of insult upon her whole family And for her part if my Lord would not take it amiss and perhaps he would not as the motion came not from himself but from me she would very willingly dispense with his Lordship's presence the rather as dress and appearance would then be unnecessary For she could not bear to think of decking her person while her parents were in tears  How excellent this did not her parents richly deserve to be in tears  See Belford with so charming a niceness we might have been a long time ago upon the ve  ge of the state and yet found a great deal to do before we enter'd into it  All obedience all resignationNo will but hers I withdrew and wrote directly to my Lord and she not disapproving of it sent it away The purport as follows for I took no copy  'That I was much obliged to his Lordship for his intended goodness to me on an occasion that was the most solemn and awful of my life That the admirable Lady whom he so justly praised thought his Lordship's proposals in her favour too high That she chose not to make a public appearance if without disobliging my friends she could avoid it till a reconciliation with her own could be effected That altho' she expressed a grateful sense of his Lordship's consent to give her to me with his own hand yet presuming that the motive to his kind intention was rather to do her honour than that it otherwise would have been his own choice especially as travelling would be at this time so inconvenient to him she thought it adviseable to save his Lordship trouble on this occasion and hoped he would take as meant her declining the favour'  'The Lawn I tell him will be most acceptable to retire to and still the more as it is so to his Lordship'  'But if he pleases the jointure may be made from my own estate leaving to his Lordship's goodness the alternative'  'That I had offer'd to present to the Lady his Lordship's bill but on her declining to accept of it having myself no present occasion for it I returned it inclosed with my thanks  c  '  And is not this going a plaguy length What a figure should I make in rakish annals if at last I should be caught in my own gin  The Sex may say what they will but a poor innocent fellow had need to take great care of himself when he dances upon the edge of the matrimonial precipice Many a fainthearted man when he began in jest or only designed to ape gallantry has been forced into earnest by being overprompt and taken at his word not knowing how to own that he meant less than the Lady supposed he meant I am the better enabled to judge that this must have been the case of many a sneaking varlet because I who know the female world as well as any man in it of my standing am so frequently in doubt of myself and know not what to make of the matter  Then these little sly rogues how they lie couchant ready to spring upon us harmless fellows the moment we are in their reachWhen the ice is once broken for them how swiftly can they make to portMeantime the subject they can least  speak  to they most  think  of Nor can you talk of the ceremony before they have laid out in their minds how it is all to beLittle saucyface designers how first they draw themselves in then us  But be all these things as they will Lord M never in his life received so handsome a letter as this from his nephew  THE Lady after having given to Miss Howe the particulars which are contained in Mr Lovelace's last letter thus expresses herself  'A principal consolation arising from these favourable appearances is that I who have now but one only friend shall most probably and if it be not my own fault have as many new ones as there are persons in Mr Lovelace's family and this whether Mr Lovelace treat me kindly or not And who knows but that by degrees those new friends by their rank and merit may have weight enough to get me restored to the favour of my relations Till which can be effected I shall not be tolerably easy Happy I never expect to be Mr Lovelace's mind sand mine are vastly different different in  essentials    'But as matters are at present circumstanced I pray you my dear friend to keep to yourself every thing that revealed might bring discredit to himBetter anybody expose a husband than a wife if I am to be so and what is said by you will be thought to come from me  'It shall be my constant prayer that all the felicities which this world can afford may be yours And that the Almighty will never suffer you nor yours to the remotest posterity to want such a friend as my Anna Howe has been to  Her  CLARISSA HARLOWE  MR Lovelace to shew the wantonness of his invention in his next gives his friend an account of a scheme he had framed to be revenged on Miss Howe when she set out for the isle of Wight which he heard she was to do accompanied by her mother and Mr Hickman in order to visit a rich aunt there who desired to see  her  and her future consort before she changed her name But as he does not intend to carry it into execution it is omitted  LETTER XXXIV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  IF Belford thou likest not my plot upon Miss Howe I have three or four more as good in my own opinion better perhaps they will be in thine And so 'tis but getting loose from thy present engagement and thou shalt pick and choose But as for thy three brethren they must do as I'd have them And so indeed must thouElse why am I your generalBut I will refer this subject to its proper season Thou knowest that I never absolutely conclude upon a project till 'tis time for execution And then lightning strikes not quicker than I  And now to the subject next my heart  Wilt thou believe me when I tell thee that I have so many contrivances rising up and crouding upon me for preference with regard to my Gloriana that I hardly know which to chooseI could tell thee of no less than six princely ones any of which  must  do But as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble I think I ought not in gratitude to spare combustibles for her but on the contrary to make her stare and stand aghast by springing three or four mines at once  Thou remembrest what Shakespeare in his Troilus and Cressida makes Hector who however is not used to boast say to Achilles in an interview between them and which applied to this watchful Lady and to the vexation she has given me and to the certainty I now think I have of subduing her will run thusSupposing the charmer before me and I meditating her sweet person from head to foot  Henceforth  O watchful fair one  guard thee well  For I'll not kill thee There nor There nor There  But by the  zone that circles Venus' waist  I'll kill thee Ev'rywhere yea o'er and o'er  Thou wisest  Belford  pardon me this brag  Her watchfulness  draws folly from my lips  But I'll endeavour  deeds  to match the  words  Or may I never  Then I imagine thee interposing to qualify my impatience as Ajax did to Achilles  Do not chafe thee cousin  And let these threats alone  Till  accident  or  purpose  bring thee to it  And now Jack what dost think  That thou art a cursed fellow if  If No If'sBut I shall be very sick tomorrow I shall 'faith  SickWhy sickWhat a devil shouldst thou be sick for  For more good reasons than one Belford  I should be glad to hear but oneSick quotha Of all thy roguish inventions I should not have thought of this  Perhaps thou thinkest my view to be to draw the lady to my bedside That's a trick of three or four thousand years old and I should find it much more to my purpose if I could get to her's However I'll condescend to make thee as wise as myself  I am excessively disturb'd about this smuggling scheme of Miss Howe I have no doubt that my fair one will fly from me if she can were I to make an attempt and miscarry I once believed she loved me But now I doubt whether she does or not At least that it is with such an  ardor  as Miss Howe calls it as will make her overlook a premeditated fault should I be guilty of one  And what will being sick do for thee  Have patience I don't intend to be so very bad as Dorcas shall represent me to be But yet I know  I shall reach confoundedly and bring up some clotted blood To be sure I shall break a vessel There's no doubt of that and a bottle of Eaton's styptic shall be sent for but no doctor If she has  humanity  she will be concerned But if she has  love  let it have been push'd ever so far back it will on this occasion come forward and shew itself not only in her eye but in every line of her sweet face  I will be very intrepid I will not fear death or any thing else I will be sure of being well in an hour or two having formerly found great benefit by this balsamic medicine on occasion of an inward bruise by a fall from my horse in hunting of which perhaps this malady may be the remains And this will shew her that tho' those about me may make the most of it I don't and so can have no design in it  Well methinks thou sayest I begin to think tolerably of this device  I knew thou wouldst when I explained myself Another time prepare to wonder and banish doubt  Now Belford if she be not much concerned at the broken vessel which in one so fiery in his temper as I have the reputation to be thought may be very dangerous a malady that I shall calmly attribute to the harasses and doubts that I have laboured under for some time past which will be a further proof of my love and will demand a grateful return  What then thou egregious contriver  Why then I shall have the less remorse if I am to use a little violence For can she deserve compassion who shews none  And what if she shew a great deal of concern  Then shall I be in hope of building on a good foundation Love hides a multitude of faults and diminishes those it cannot hide Love when found out or acknowleged authorizes freedom and freedom  begets freedom and I shall then see how far I can go  Well but Lovelace how the duce wilt thou with that full health and vigour of constitution and with that bloom in thy face make anybody believe thou art sick  HowWhy take a few grains of Ipecacuanha enough to make me reach like a fury  GoodBut how wilt thou manage to bring up blood and not hurt thyself  Foolish fellow Are there not pigeons and chickens in every poulterer's shop  Cry thy mercy  But then I will be persuaded by Mrs Sinclair that I have of late confined myself too much and so will have a chair called and be carried to the Park where I will try to walk half the length of the Mall or so and in my return amuse myself at White's or the Cocoa  And what will this do  Questioning againI am afraid thou'rt an infidel BelfordWhy then shall I not know if my beloved offers to go out in my absenceAnd shall I not se  whether she receives me with tenderness at my return But this is not all I have a foreboding that something affecting will happen while I am out But of this more in its place  And now Belford wilt thou or wilt thou not allow that it is a right thing to be sickLord Jack so much delight do I take in my contrivances that I shall be halfsorry when the occasion for them is over for never never shall I again have such charming exercise for my invention  Mean time these plaguy women are so impertinent so full of reproaches that I know not how to do any thing but curse them And then truly they are for helping me out with some of their trite and vulgar artificesSally particularly who pretends to be a mighty contriver has just now in an insolent manner  told me on my rejecting her proffer'd aids that I had no mind to conquer and that I was so  wicked  as to intend to marry tho' I would not own it to her  Because this little devil made her first sacrifice at my altar she thinks she may take any liberty with me And what makes her outrageous at times is that I have for a long time  studiously  as she says slighted her too readily offer'd favours But is it not very impudent in her to think that I will be any man's successor It is not come to that neither This thou knowest was always my rule  Once any other man's  and  I  know it and  never more mine  It is for such as thou and thy brethren to take up with  harlots  I have been always aiming at the merit of a first discoverer  The more devil I perhaps thou'lt say to endeavour to corrupt the uncorrupted  But I say  Not  since hence I have but very few adulteries to answer for  One affair indeed at Paris with a married lady I believe I never told thee of it touched my conscience a little Yet brought on by the spirit of intrigue more than by sheer wickedness I'll give it thee in brief  'A French marquis somewhat in years employ'd by his court in a public function at that of Madrid had put his charming young newmarried wife under the controul and  wardship  as I may say of his insolent sister an old prude  'I saw the lady at the opera I liked her at first sight and better at second when I knew the situation she was in So pretending to make my addresses to the prude got admittance to both  'The first thing I had to do was to compliment my prude into shyness by complaints of shyness Next to take advantage of the marquise's situation between her husband's jealousy and his sister's arrogance to inspire her with resentment and as I  hoped with a regard to my person The Frenc  ladies have no dislike to intrigue  'The sister began to suspect me The lady had no mind to part with the company of the only man who had been permitted to visit there and told me of her sister's suspicionsI put her upon concealing the prude as if unknown to me in a closet in one of her own apartments locking her in and putting the key in her own pocket And she was to question me on the sincerity of my professions to her sister in her sister's hearing  'She comply'd My mistress was locked up The lady and I took our seats I owned fervent love and made high professions For the marquise put it home to me The prude was delighted with what she heard  'And how dost think it endedI took my advantage of the lady herself who durst not for her life cry out Drew her after me to the next apartment on pretence of going to seek her sister who all the time was locked up in the closet  'No woman ever gave me a private meeting for nothing my dearest Miss Harlowe excepted  'My ingenuity obtained my pardon The lady being unable to forbear laughing thro' the whole affair to find both so uncommonly tricked her gaoleress her prisoner safe locked up and as much pleased as either of us  'The English Jack do not often outwit the French  'We had contrivances afterwards equally ingenious in which the lady the ice once broken  once subdued always subdued  cooperatedBut a more tender telltale revealed the secretRevealed it before the marquis could come to cover the disgrace The sister was inveterate the husband irreconcileable in every respect unfit for a husband even for a  French  onemade perhaps more delicate to  these particulars by the customs of a people among whom he was then resident▪ so contrary to those of his own countrymen She was obliged to throw herself into my protectionNor thought herself unhappy in it till childbed pangs seized her Then penitence and death overtook her in the same hour'  Excuse a tear BelfordShe deserv'd a better fate What has such a vile inexorable husband to answer forThe sister was punished effectually That pleases me on reflection The sister was punish'd effectuallyBut perhaps I have told thee this story before  LETTER XXXV Mr  LOVELACE  To

favoured with her company  an hour before she retires to rest  All that obsequious love can suggest in order to engage her tenderest sentiments for me against tomorrow's sickness will I aim at when we meet But at parting will complain of a disorder in my stomach  WE have met All was love and unexceptionable respect on my part Ease and complaisance on hers She was concerned for my disorder So suddenJust as we parted But it was nothing I should be quite well by morning  Faith Jack I think I am sick alreadyIs it possible for such a giddy fellow as me to persuade myself to be ill I am a better mimic at this rate than I wish to be But every nerve and fibre of me is always ready to contribute its aid whether by health or by ailment to carry a resolved on roguery into execution  Dorcas has transcribed for me the whole letter of Miss How dated Sunday May  Letter  x  of this Vol p    of which before I had only extracts But she found no other letter added to that parcel But this and that which I copy'd myself in character last Sunday while she was at church relating to the smuggling scheme  Letter  xxii▪  p      are enough for me  DORCAS tells me that her lady has been removing her papers from the mahoganychest into a wainscot  ox which held her linen and which she put into her dark closet We have no key of that at present No doubt but all her letters previous to those I have c  me at are in that box Dorcas is uneasy upon it Yet hopes that her lady does not suspect her for she is sure that she laid in every thing as she found it  LETTER XXXVI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Cocoatree  Saturday May    THIS Ipecacuanha is a most disagreeable medicine▪ That these cursed physical folks can find out nothing to do us good but what would poison the devil▪ In the other world were they only to take physic it would be punishment enough of itself for a misspent life A doctor at one elbow and an apothecary at the other and the poor soul labouring under their prescribed operations he need no worse tormentors  But now this was to take down my countenance It has done it For with violent reachings having taken enough to make me sick and not enough water to carry it off I presently looked as if I had kept my bed a fortnight  Illjesting  as I thought in the midst of the exercise  with edgetools  and worse with  physical ones    Two hours it held me I had forbid Dorcas to let my beloved know any thing of the matter out of tenderness to her being willing when she knew my prohibition to let her see that I  expected  her to be concerned for meWhat a worthless fellow must  he  be whose own heart gives him up as deserving of no one's regard  Well but Dorcas nevertheless is a  woman  and she can  whisper  to her lady the secret she is injoin'd to keep  Come hither you toad sick as a devil at the instant Let me see what a mixture of grief and surprize may be beat up together in thy puddenface  That won't do That dropt jaw and mouth d  stended

taken With a vomiting of blood in great quantities Some vessel broken He complained of a disorder in his stomach overnight I was the more affected with it as I am afraid it was occasioned by the violent contentions between usBut was I in fault  How lately did I think I hated himBut hatred and anger I see are but temporary passions with me One cannot my dear hate people in danger of death or who are in distress or affliction My heart I find is not proof against kindness and acknowlegement of errors committed  He took great care to have his illness concealed from me as long as it could So tender in the violence of his disorderSo desirous to make the best of itI wish he had not been ill in my sight I was too much affectedEverybody alarming me with his dangerThe poor man from such high health so  suddenly  takenAnd so unprepared  He is gone out in a chair I advised him to do so I fear that my advice was wrong since Quiet in such a disorder must needs be best We are apt to be so ready in cases of emergency to give our advice without judgment or waiting for itI proposed a physician indeed but he would not hear of one I have great honour for the faculty and the greater as I have always observed that those who treat the  professors of the art of healing contemptuously too generally treat higher institutions in the same manner  I am really very uneasy For I have I doubt exposed myself to him and to the women below  They  indeed will excuse me as they think us married But if he be not generous I shall have cause to regret this surprize which has taught me more than I knew of myself as I had reason to think myself unaccountably treated by him  Nevertheless let me tell you what I hope I may justly tell you that if again he give me cause to resume distance and reserve I hope my reason will gather strength enough from his imperfections for Mr Lovelace my dear is not a wise man in all his ways to enable me to keep my passions underWhat can we do more than govern ourselves by the temporary lights lent us  You will not wonder that I am grave on this detection  Detection  must I call it What can I call itI have not had heart'sease enough to inspect that heart as I ought  Dissatisfied with myself I am afraid to look back upon what I have written And yet know not how to have done writing I never was in such an odd frame of mindI know not how to describe itWas  you  ever  so  Afraid of the censure of her I loveYet not conscious that I deserve it  Of this however I am convinced that I should  indeed  deserve censure if I kept any secret of my heart from you  But I will not add another word after I have assured you that I will look still more narrowly into myself And that I am  Your equally sincere and affectionate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XXXVIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat evening  I Had a charming airing No return of my malady My heart perfectly easy how could my stomach be otherwise  But when I came home I found that my sweet soul had been alarmed by a new incident The inquiry after us both in a very suspicious manner and that by description of our persons and not by names by a servant in a blue livery turned up and trimmed with yellow  Dorcas was called to him as the upper servant and she refusing to answer any of his questions unless he told his business and from whom he came the fellow as short as she said That if she would not answer  him  perhaps she might answer somebody  else  and went away out of humour  Dorcas hurried up to her lady and alarmed her not only with the fact but with her own conjectures adding that he was an illlooking fellow and she was sure could come for no good  The livery and the features of the servant were particularly inquired after and as particularly described  Lord bless her no end of her alarms she thought  And then was she aforehand with every evil that could happen  She wished Mr Lovelace would come in  Mr Lovelace came in soon after all lively grateful full of hopes of duty of love to thank his charmer and to congratulate with her upon the cure she had performed And then she told the story with all its circumstances and Dorcas to point her lady's fears told us that the servant was a sunburnt fellow and looke as if he had been at sea  He was then no doubt Captain Singleton's servant and the next news she should hear was th  the house was surrounded by a whole ship's crew th  vessel lying no farther off as she understood than Rotherhith  Impossible I said Such an attempt would not be usher'd in by such a manner of inquiry And why may it not rather be a servant of your cousin Morden's with notice of his arrival and of his design to attend you  This surmize delighted her Her apprehensions went off and she was at leisure to congratulate me upon my sudden recovery which she did in the most obliging manner  But we had not sat long together when Dorcas again came fluttering up to tell us that the footman the  very  footman was again at the door and inquired whether Mr Lovelace and his Lady by name had no  lodgings in this house He asked he told Dorcas for no harm But this was a demonstration with my apprehensive fairone that harm was intended And as the sellow had not been answered by Dorcas I proposed to go down to the streetparlour and hear what he had to say  I see your causeless terror my dearest life said I and your impatienceWill you be pleased to walk downAnd without being observed as he shall come no farther than the parlourdoor you may hear all that passes  She consented We went down Dorcas bid the man come forwardWell friend what is your business with Mr or Mrs Lovelace  Bowing scraping I am sure you are the gentleman Sir Why Sir my business is only to know if your honour be here and to be spoke with or it you shall be here for any time  Who came you from  From a gentleman who ordered me to say if I was  made  to tell but not else it was from a friend of Mr John Harlowe's Mrs Lovelace's eldest uncle  The dear creature was ready to sink upon this It was but of late that she had provided herself with salts She pulled them out  Do you know any thing of Colonel Morden friend said I  No I never heard of his name  Of Captain Singleton  No Sir But the gentleman my master is a captain too  What is his name  I don't know if I should tell  There can be no harm in telling the gentleman's name if you come upon a good account  That I do for my master told me so and there is not an honester gentleman on the face of  God's earth  His name is Captain Tomlinson Sir  I don't know such a one  I believe not Sir He was pleased to say He don't know your honour Sir but I heard him say as how he should not be an unwelcome visitor to you for all that  Do you know such a man as Captain Tomlinson my dearest life  aside  your uncle's friend  No but my uncle may have acquaintance no doubt that I don't knowBut I hope trembling this is not a trick  Well friend if your master has any thing to say to Mr Lovelace you may tell him that Mr Lovelace is here and will give him a meeting whenever he pleases  The dear creature looked as if afraid that my engagement was too prompt for my own safety and away went the fellow  I  wondering that  she  might not wonder that this Captain Tomlinson whoever he was came not himself or sent not a letter the second time when he had reason to suppose that I might be here  Mean time for fear that this should be a contriveance of James Harlowe's who I said loved plotting though he had not a head turned for it I gave some precautionary directions to the servants and the women whom for the greater parade I assembled before us And my beloved was resolved not to stir abroad till she saw the issue of this odd affair  And here must I close though in so great a puzzle  Only let me add that poor Belton wants thee for I dare not stir for my life  Mowbray and Tourville skulk about like vagabonds without heads without hands without souls having neither Thee nor Me to conduct them They tell me they shall rust beyond the power of oil or action to brighten them up or give them motion  How goes it with thy uncle  LETTER XXXIX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday May    THIS story of Captain Tomlinson employed us not only for the time we were together last night but all the while we sat at breakfast this morning She would still have it that it was the prelude to some mischief from Singleton I insisted that it might much more probably be a method taken by Colonel Morden to alarm her previous to a personal visit Travelled gentlemen affected to surprize in this manner And why dearest creature said I must every thing that happens which we cannot immediately account for be what we least wish  She had had so many disagreeable things befal her of late that her fears were too often stronger than her hopes  And this Madam makes me apprehensive that you will get into so lowspirited a way that you will  not be able to enjoy the happiness that seems to await us  Her duty and her gratitude she gravely said to the Dispenser of all good would secure her she hoped against unthankfulness And a thankful spirit was the same as a joyful one  So Belford for all her future joys she depends intirely upon the Invisible Good She is certainly right since those who fix least upon Second Causes are the least likely to be disappointedAnd is not this gravity for her gravity  She had hardly done speaking when Dorcas came running up in a hurryShe set even  my  heart into a palpitationThump thump thump like a precipitated pendulum in a clockcaseFlutter flutter flutter my charmer's as by her sweet bosom rising to her chin I saw  This lower class of people my Beloved herself observed were for ever aiming at the stupid Wonderful and for making even common incidents matter of surprize  Why the devil said I to the wench this alarming hurryAnd with your spread fingers and your O Madams and O Sirsand be curs'd to you Would there have been a second of time difference had you come up slowly  Captain Tomlinson Sir  Captain Devilson what care IDo you see how you have disordered your lady  Good Mr Lovelace said my charmer trembling See Jack when she has an end to serve I am  good  Mr Lovelace Ifif my brotherif Captain Single  on should appearPray nowI beseech youLet me beg of youto govern your temperMy brother is my brotherCaptain Singleton is but an  gent    My dearest life folding my arms about her When  she asks favours thought I the devil's in it if she will not allow of such innocent freedoms as this from  good  Mr Lovelace too you shall be witness of all that passes between us Dorcas desire the gentleman to walk up  Let me retire to my chamber first Let me not be known to be in the house  Charming dearThou seest Belford she is afraid of leaving meO the little witchcrafts Were it not for surprize nowandthen how would an honest man know where to have them  She withdrew to listenAnd tho' this incident has not turned out to answer all I wish'd from it yet is it necessary if I would acquaint thee with my whole circulation to be very particular in what passed between Captain Tomlinson and me  Enter Captain Tomlinson in a ridingdress whip in hand  Your servant SirMr Lovelace I presume  My name is Lovelace Sir  Excuse the Day SirBe pleased to excuse my Garb I am obliged to go out of town directly that I may return at night  The Day is a good day Your Garb needs no apology  When I sent my servant I did not know that I should  find time to do myself this honour  All that I thought I could do to oblige my friend this journey was  only  to assure myself of your abode and whether there was a probability of being admitted to your speech or to your Lady's  Sir you know best your own motives What your time will permit you to do you also best know And here I am attending your pleasure  My charmer owned afterwards her concern on my being so short Whatever I shall mingle of her em  tions thou wilt easily guess I had afterwards  Sir I hope no offence I intend none  NoneNone at all Sir  Sir I have no interest in the affair I come about I may appear officious and if I thought I should I would decline any concern in it after I have just hinted what it is  And what pray Sir is it  May I ask you Sir without offence whether you wish to be reconciled and to cooperate upon honourable terms with  one  gentleman of the name of Harlowe preparative as it may be hoped to a general reconciliation  O how my heart flutter'd  cried my charmer  I can't tell Sir  And then it flutter'd still more no doubt  The whole family have used me extremely ill They have taken greater liberties with my character than are justifiable and with my family  too  which I can less forgive  Sir Sir I have done I beg pardon for this intrusion  My Beloved then was ready to sink and thought very hardly of me  But pray Sir to the immediate purpose of your present commission since a commission it seems to be  It  is  a commission Sir andsuch a one as I thought would be agreeable to all parties or I should not have given myself concern about it  Perhaps it  may  Sir when known But let me ask you one previous question Do you know Colonel Morden Sir  No Sir If you mean  personally  I do not But I have heard my good friend Mr John Harlowe talk of him with great respect and as a cotrustee with him in a certain trust  I thought it probable Sir said I that the Colonel might be arrived that you might be a gentleman of  his acquaintance and that something of an agreeable surprize might be intended  Had Colonel Morden been in England Mr John Harlowe would have known it and then I should not have been a stranger to it  Well but Sir have you then any commission to me from Mr John Harlowe  Sir I will tell you as briefly as I can the whole of what I have to say but you'll excuse  me  also a previous question for which curiosity is not my motive but it is necessary to be answered before I can proceed as you will judge when you hear it  What pray Sir is your question  Briefly Whether you are actually and  bona fide  married to Miss Clarissa Harlowe  I started and in a haughty tone Is this Sir a question that  must  be answered before you can proceed in the business you have undertaken  I mean no offence Mr Lovelace Mr Harlowe sought to me to undertake this office I have daughters and nieces of my own I thought it a good office or I who have many considerable affairs upon my hands had not accepted of it I know the world and will take the liberty to say That if that young Lady  Captain Tomlinson I think you are called  My name is Tomlinson  Why then Captain Tomlinson no  liberty  as you call it will be taken well that is not extremely delicate when that lady is mentioned  When you had heard me out Mr Lovelace and had found I had so behaved as to make the caution necessary it would have been just to have given itAllow me to say I know what is due to the character of a woman of virtue as well as any man alive  Why Sir Why Captain Tomlinson you seem warm If you intend anything by this  O how I trembled  said the Lady  when she took notice of this  part of our conversation afterwards  I will only say that this is a privileged place It is at present my home and an asylum for any gentleman who thinks it worth his while to inquire after me be the manner or end of his inquiry what it will  I know not Sir that I have given occasion for this I make no scruple to attend you  elsewhere  if I am troublesome here I was told I had a warm young gentleman to deal with But as I knew my intention and that my commission was an amicable one I was the less concerned about that I am twice your age Mr Lovelace I dare say But I do assure you that if either my message or my manner give you offence I can suspend the one or the other for a day or for ever as you like And so Sir any time before eight tomorrow morning you will let me know your further commandsAnd was going to tell me where he might be found  Captain Tomlinson said I you answer well I love a man of spirit Have you not been in the army  I have Sir but have  turned my sword into a ploughshare  as the Scripture has it  There was a clever fellow JackHe was a good man with somebody I warrant  And all my delight added he for some years past has been in cultivating my paternal estate I love a brave man Mr Lovelace as well as ever I did in my life But let me tell you Sir that when you come to my time of life you will be of opinion that there is not so much true bravery in youthful choler as you may now think there is  A clever fellow again BelfordEar and heart both at once he took in my charmer  'Tis well  she says  there are some men who have wisdom in their anger    Well Captain that is reproof for reproof So we are upon a foot And now give me the pleasure of hearing your commission  Sir you must first allow me to repeat my question  Are you really and  bona fide  married to Miss Clarissa Harlowe Or are you not yet married  Bluntly put Captain But if I answer that I  am  what then  Why then Sir I shall say that you are a man of honour  That I hope I am whether you  say  it or not Captain Tomlinson  Sir I will be very frank in all I have to say on this subjectMr John Harlowe has lately found out that you and his niece are both in the same lodgings that you have been long so and that the lady was at the Play with you yesterday was se'ennight and he hopes that you are actually married He has indeed heard that you are but as he knows your enterprizing temper and that you have declared that you disdain a relation to their family he is willing by me to have your marriage confirmed from your own mouth before he takes the steps he is inclined to take in his niece's favour You will allow me to say Mr Lovelace that he will not be satisfied with an answer that admits of the least doubt  Let me tell you Captain Tomlinson that it is a damn'd degree of vileness for any man to suppose  SirMr Lovelacedon't put yourself into a passion The Lady's relations are jealous of the honour of their family They have prejudices to overcome as well as youAdvantage may have been takenand the Lady at the  time  not to blame  This Lady Sir could give no such advantages And if she  had  what must the  man  be Captain Tomlinson who could have taken themDo you know the Lady Sir  I never had the honour to see her but once and that was at church and should not know her again  Not know her again SirI thought that there was not a man living who had once seen her and would not know her among a thousand  I remember Sir that I thought I never saw a finer woman in my life But Mr Lovelace I believe you will allow that it is better that her relations should have wronged  you  than you the  Lady  I hope Sir you will permit me to repeat my question  Enter Dorcas in a hurry  A  gentleman  this minute Sir desires to speak with your honour  My Lady SirAside  Could the dear creature put  Dorcas  upon telling this fib yet want to save  me  one  Desire the gentleman to walk into one of the parlours I will wait on him presently    Exit Dorcas  The dear creature I doubted not wanted to instruct me how to answer the Captain's homeput I knew how I intended to answer itPlumb▪ thou may'st be sureBut Dorcas's message stagger'd me And yet I was upon one of my masterstrokesWhich was To take advantage of the Captain's inquiries and to make her own her marriage before him as she had done to the people below and if she had been brought to that to induce her for her uncle's satisfaction to write him a letter of gratitude which of course must have been signed  Clarissa Lovelace  I was loth therefore thou may'st believe to attend her sudden commands And yet afraid of pushing matters beyond recovery with her I thought proper to lead him from the question to account for himself for Mr Harlowe's coming at the knowlege of where we are and for other particulars which I knew would engage her attention and which might possibly convince her of the necessity there was for her to acquiesce in the affirmative I was disposed to give And this for her own sake for what as I asked her afterwards is it to me whether I am ever reconciled to a family I must for ever despise  You think Captain that I have answered doubtfully to the question you have put You  may  think so And you must know that I have a good deal of pride And only that you are a gentleman and seem in this affair to be governed by generous principles or I should ill brook being interrogated as to my honour to a lady so dear to meBut before I answer more directly to the point pray satisfy me in a question or two that I shall put to  you    With all my heart Sir Ask me what questions you please I will answer them with sincerity and candour  You say That Mr Harlowe has found out that we were at a Play together And that we are both in the same lodgingsHow pray came he at his knowlegeFor let me tell you that I have for certain considerations not respecting myself condescended that our abode should be kept secret And this has been so strictly observed that even Miss Howe tho' she and my beloved correspond knows not directly whither to send to us  Why Sir the person who saw you at the Play was a tenant of Mr John Harlowe He watched all your motions When the Play was done he followed your coach to your lodgings And early the next day Sunday he took horse and acquainted his landlord with what he had observed  How oddly things come about Captain TomlinsonBut does any other of the Harlowes know where we are  It is an absolute secret to every other person of the family and so it is intended to be kept As also that Mr John Harlowe is willing to enter into treaty with you by me if his niece be actually married for perhaps he is aware that he shall have difficulty enough with some people to bring about the desirable  reconciliation altho' he could give them this assurance  I doubt it not CaptainTo James Harlowe is all the family folly owingFine fools  heroically stalking about  to be governed by one to whom malice and not genius gives the busy liveliness that distinguishes him from a naturalBut how long pray Sir has Mr John Harlowe been in this pacific disposition  I will tell you Mr Lovelace and the occasion and be very explicit upon it and upon all that concerns you to know of me and of the commission I have undertaken and this the rather as when you have heard me out you will be satisfied that I am not an officious man in this my present address to you  I am all attention Captain Tomlinson  And so I doubt not was my beloved  'You must know Sir said the Captain that I have not been many months in Mr John Harlowe's neighbourhood I removed from Northamptonshire partly for the sake of better managing one of two Executorships which I could not avoid engaging in the affairs of which frequently call me to town and are part of my present business and partly for the sake of occupying a neglected farm which has lately fallen into my hands But tho' an acquaintance of no longer standing and that commencing on the Bowlinggreen Uncle John is a great bowler Belford upon my decision of a point to every one's satisfaction which was appealed to me by all the gentlemen and which might have been attended with bad consequences no two brothers have a more cordial esteem for each other You know Mr Lovelace that there is a  consent  as I may call it in some minds which will unite them stronger in a few hours than years will  do with others whom yet we see not with disgust'  Very true Captain  'It was on the foot of this avowed friendship on both sides that on Monday the th as I very well remember Mr Harlowe invited himself home with me And when there he acquainted me with the whole of the unhappy affair that had made them all so uneasy Till then I knew it only by report for intimate as we were I forbore to speak of what was so near his heart till he began first And then he told me that he had had an application made to him two or three days before by a gentleman whom he named  See Miss Howe's Letters Numb  iv  p    and Numb  x  p    of this Volume  to induce him not only to be reconciled to his niece himself but to forward for her a general reconciliation  'A like application he told me had been made to his sister Harlowe by a good woman whom everybody respected who had intimated that his niece if encouraged would again put herself into the protection of her friends and leave you But if not that she must unavoidably be yours'  I hope Mr Lovelace I make no mischiefYou look concernedYou sigh Sir  Proceed Captain Tomlinson Pray proceed  And I sighed still more profoundly  'They all thought it extremely particular that a lady should decline marriage with a man she had so lately gone away with'  Pray CaptainPray Mr TomlinsonNo more of this subject My beloved is an angel In every thing unblameable Whatever faults there have been have been theirs and mine What you would further say is that the  unforgiving  family rejected her application They did She and I had had a misunderstanding  The falling out of lovers  you know CaptainWe have been happier ever since  'Well Sir but Mr John Harlowe could not but better consider the matter afterwards And he desired my advice how to act in it He told me that no father ever loved a daughter as he loved this niece of his whom indeed he used to call his  daughterniece  He said she had really been unkindly treated by her brother and sister And as your alliance Sir was far from being a discredit to their family he would do his endeavour to reconcile all parties if he could be sure that ye were actually man and wife'  And what pray Captain was your advice  'I gave it as my opinion that if his niece were unworthily treated and in distress as he apprehended from the application to him he would soon hear of her again But that it was likely that this application was made without expecting it would succeed and as a salvo only to herself for marrying without their consent And the rather as he had told me that it came from a young lady her friend and not in a direct way from herself which young lady was no favourite of the family and therefore would hardly have been employed had success been expec  ed'  Very well Captain TomlinsonPray proceed  'Here the matter rested till last Sunday evening when Mr John Harlowe came to me with the man who had seen you and your lady as I hope she is at the Play and who had assured him that you both lodged in the same houseAnd then the application having been so lately made which implied that you were not then married he was so uneasy for his niece's honour that I advised him to dispatch to town some one in whom he could confide to make proper inquiries  Very well CaptainAnd was such a person employed on such an errand by her uncle  'A trusty and discreet person was accordingly sent and last Tuesday I think it was for he returned to us on the Wednesday he made the inquiries among the neighbours first  The very inquiry Jack that gave us all so much uneasiness  See p    of this Vol  But finding that none of them could give any satisfactory account the lady's woman was come at who declared that you were actually married But the inquirist keeping himself on the reserve as to his employers the girl refused to tell the day or to give him other particulars'  You give a very clear account of everything Captain Tomlinson Pray go on  'The gentleman returned and on his report Mr Harlowe having still doubts and being willing to proceed on some grounds in so important a point besought me as my affairs called me frequently to town to undertake this matter You Mr Tomlinson he was pleased to say have children of your own You know the world You know what I drive at You will proceed I know with understanding and spirit And whatever you are satisfied with shall satisfy me'  Enter Dorcas again in a hurry  Sir The gentleman is impatient  I will attend him presently  The Captain then accounted for his not calling in person when he had reason to think us here  He said he had business of consequence a few miles out of town whither he thought he must have gone yesterday and having been obliged to put off his little journey till this day and understanding that we were within not knowing whether he should have such another opportunity he was willing to try his  good fortune before he set out and this made him come booted and spurred as I saw him  He dropped a hint in commendation of the people of the house but it was in such away as to give no room for suspicion that he thought it necessary to make any inquiries after the character of persons who make so genteel an appearance as he observed they do  And here let me remark to the same purpose that my beloved might collect another circumstance in their favour had she doubted them from the silence of her uncle's inquirist on Tuesday among the neighbours  And now Sir said he that I believe I have satisfied you in every thing relating to my commission I hope you will permit me to repeat my questionwhich is  Enter Dorcas again out of breath  Sir the gentleman will step up to  youMy lady is impatient She wonders at your honour's delay Aside  Excuse me Captain for one moment  I have staid my full time Mr LovelaceWhat may result from my question and your answer whatever it shall be may take us up timeAnd you are engagedWill you permit me to attend you in the morning before I set out on my return  You will then breakfast with me Captain  It must be early if I do I must reach my own house tomorrow night or I shall make the best of wives unhappy And I have two or three places to call at in my way  It shall be by seven o'clock if you please Captain We are early folks And this I will tell you that if ever I am reconciled to a family so implacable as I have always found the Harlowes to be it must be by the mediation of so cool and so moderate a gentleman as yourself  And so with the highest civilities on both sides we  parted But for the private satisfaction of so good a man I left him out of doubt that we were man and wife tho' I did not directly aver it  LETTER XL Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday Night  THIS Captain Tomlinson is one of the happiest as well as one of the best men in the world What would I give to stand as high in my beloved's opinion as he does But yet I am as good a man as he were I to tell my own story and have equal credit given to it But the devil should have had him before I had seen him on the account he came upon had I thought I should not have answered my principal end in itI hinted to thee in my last what that was  But to the particulars of the conference between my fair one and me on her hasty messages which I was loth to come to because she has had a half triumph over me in it  After I had attended the Captain down to the very passage I returned to the diningroom and put on a joyful air on my beloved's entrance into itO my dearest creature let me congratulate you on a prospect so agreeable to your wishesAnd I snatched her hand and smothered it with my kisses  I was going on when interrupting meYou see Mr Lovelace said she how you have embarassed yourself by your own obliquitiesYou see that you have not been able to return a direct answer to a plain and honest question tho' upon it depends all the happiness you congratulate me upon the prospect of  You know my best love what my prudent and I will say my  kind  motives were for giving out that we were married You see that I have taken  no advantage of it and that no inconvenience has followed itYou see that your uncle wants only to be assured from ourselves that it is so  Not another word to this purpose Mr Lovelace I will not only risk but I will forfeit the reconciliation so near my heart rather than I will go on to countenance a story so untrue  My dearest soulWould you have me appear  I would have you appear Sir as  you are  I am resolved that I will appear to my uncle's friend and to my uncle as  I am    For one week my dearest life cannot you for one week only till the settlements  Not for one hour with my own consentYou don't know Sir how much I have been afflicted that I have appeared to the people below what I am not But my uncle Sir shall never have it to upbraid me nor will I to upbraid myself that I have wilfully passed myself upon him in false lights  What my dear would you have me to say to the Captain tomorrow morningI have given him room to think  Then put him right Mr Lovelace Tell the truth Tell him what you please of your relations favour to me Tell him what you will about the settlements And if when drawn you will submit them to his perusal and approbation it will shew him how much you are in earnest  My dearest lifeDo you think that he would disapprove of the terms I have offer'dNo  Then may I be accursed if I willingly submit to be trampled under foot by my enemies  And may I Mr Lovelace never be happy in this life if I submit to the passing upon my uncle Harlowe a wilful and premeditated falshood for truthI have too long laboured under the affliction which the rejection of all my friends has given me to purchase  their reconciliation now at so dear a price as at that of my veracity  The women below my dear  What are they to meI want not to establish myself with them Need they know all that passes between my relations and you and me  Neither are they any thing to me Madam Only that when for the sake of preventing the fatal mischiefs which might have attended your brother's projects I have made them think us married I would not appear to them in a light which you yourself think so shocking By my soul Madam I had rather die than contradict myself so flagrantly after I have related to them so many circumstances of our marriage  Well Sir the women may believe what they please That I have given countenance to what you told them is my error The many circumstances which you own  one  untruth has drawn you in to relate is a justification of my refusal in the present case  Don't you see Madam that your uncle wishes to find us married May not the ceremony be privately over before his mediation can take place  Urge this point no farther Mr Lovelace If  you  will not tell the truth  I  will tomorrow morning if I see Captain Tomlinson tell it myself Indeed I will  Will you Madam consent that things pass as before with the people below This mediation of Tomlinson  may  come to nothing Your brother's schemes  may  be pursued the rather that now he will know perhaps from your uncle that you are not under a legal protectionYou will at least consent that things pass  here  as before  To permit this is to go on in an error Mr Lovelace But as the occasion for so doing if there  can  be an occasion in your opinion that will warrant an untruth will as I presume soon be over I shall the  less dispute that point with you But a new error I will not be guilty of if I can avoid it  Can I do you think Madam have any dishonourable view in the step I supposed you would not scruple to take towards a reconciliation with your own familyNot for  my own  sake you know did I hope you to take itFor what is it to me if I am never reconciled to your family I want no favours from them  I hope Mr Lovelace there is no occasion in our present  not  disagreeable situation to answer such a question And let me say that I shall think my prospects still more agreeable if tomorrow morning you will not only own the very truth but give my uncle's friend such an account of the steps you have taken and are taking as may keep up my uncle's favourable intentions towards me This you may do under what restrictions of secrecy you please Captain Tomlinson is a prudent man a promoter of familypeace you find and I dare say may be made a friend  I saw there was no help I saw that the inflexible Harlowe spirit was all up in herA little witchA littleForgive me Love for calling her names And so I said with an air We have had too many misunderstandings Madam for me to wish for new ones I will obey you without reserve Had I not thought I should have obliged you by the other method especially as the ceremony might have been over before any thing could have operated from your uncle's intentions and of consequence no untruth persisted in I would not have proposed itBut think not my beloved creature that you shall enjoy without condition this triumph over my judgment  And then clasping my arms about her I gave her struggledaway cheek her charming lip designed a servent kissAnd your forgiveness of this sweet freedom bowing is that condition  She was not mortally offendedAnd now must I make out the rest as well as I can But this I will tell thee that altho' her triumph has not diminished my love for her yet has it stimulated me more than ever to Revenge as thou wilt be apt to call it But Victory or Conquest is the more proper name  There is a pleasure 'tis true in subduing one of these watchful beauties But by my soul Belford men of our cast take twenty times the pains to be rogues that it would cost them to be honest and dearly with the sweat of our brows and to the puzzling of our brains to say nothing of the hazards we run do we earn our purchase And ought not therefore to be grudged our success when we meet with itEspecially as when we have obtained our end satiety soon follows and leaves us little or nothing to shew for it But this indeed may be said of all worldly delightsAnd is not that a grave reflection from me  I was willing to write up to the time Altho' I have not carried my principal point I shall make something turn out in my favour from Captain Tomlinson's errandBut let me give thee this caution that thou do not pretend to judge of my devices by  parts  but have patience till thou seest the  whole  But once more I swear that I will not be  outNorris'd  by a pair of novices And yet I am very apprehensive at times of the consequences of Miss Howe's Smuggling scheme  'Tis late or rather early for the day begins to dawn upon me I am plaguy heavy Perhaps I need not to have told thee that But will only indulge a doze in my chair for an hour then shake myself wash and refresh At my time of life with my constitution that's all that's wanted  Good night to meIt cannot be broad day till I am awakeAwwwwhaughPox of this yawning  Is not thy uncle dead yet  What's come to mine that he writes not to my lastHunting after more  wisdom of nations  I supposeYawYawYawning againPen begone  LETTER XLI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday May    NOW have I established myself for ever in my charmer's heart  The Captain came at seven as promised and ready equipped for his journey My beloved chose not to give us her company till our first conversation was overAshamed I suppose But to my shame if she was to be present at that part of it which was to restore her to her virgin state by my confession after her  wifehood  had been reported to her uncle But she took her cue nevertheless and listened to all that passed  The modestest women Jack must  think  and think deeply sometimesI wonder whether they ever blush at those things by themselves at which they have so charming a knack of blushing in companyIf not and if blushing be a sign of grace or modesty have not the sex as great a command over their blushes as they are said to have over their tears This reflection would lead me a great way into female minds were I disposed to pursue it  I told the Captain that I would prevent his question and accordingly after I had injoined the strictest secrecy that no advantage might be given to James Harlowe and which he answered for as well on Mr Harlowe's part as his own I acknowleged nakedly and fairly the whole truthTo wit  'That we were not yet marriedI gave him hints of the causes of procrastinationSome of them owing to  unhappy misunderstanding But chiefly to the Lady's desire of previous reconciliation with her friend  and to a delicacy that had no example'  Less nice ladies than this Jack love to have delays wilful and  studied  delays imputed to them in these casesYet are indelicate in their affected delicacy for do they not thereby tacitly confess that they expect to be the greatest gainers in wedlock and that there is  selfdenial  in the pride they take in delaying  'I told him the reason of our passing to the people below as marry'dYet as under a vow of restriction▪ as to consummation which had kept us both to the height one of  sorbearing  the other of  vigilant  punctilio even to the denial of those innocent freedoms which betrothed lovers never scruple to allow and to take  'I then communicated to him a copy of my proposals of settlement the substance of her written answer the contents of my letter of invitation to Lord M to be her nuptial father and of my Lord's generous reply But said that having apprehensions of delay from his infirmities and my beloved choosing by all means and that from principles of  unrequited  duty a private solemnization I had written to excuse his lordship's presence and expected an answer every hour  'The settlements I told him were actually drawing by counsellor Williams of whose eminence he must have heard He had and of the truth of this he might satisfy himself before he went out of town  'When these were drawn approved and ingrossed nothing I said but signing and the nomination of my happy day would be wanting I had a pride I declared in doing the highest justice to so beloved a creature of my own voluntary motion and without the intervention of a family from whom I had received the greatest insults And this being our  present situation I was contented that Mr John Harlowe should suspend his reconciliatory purposes till our marriage were actually solemnized'  The Captain was highly delighted with all I had said Yet owned that as his dear friend Mr Harlowe had  xpressed himself greatly pleased to hear that we were  ctually marry'd he could have wished it  had  been so But nevertheless he doubted not that all would be  ell  He saw my reasons he said and approved of them  or making the gentlewomen below whom again he  nderstood to be good sort of people  believe that the  eremony had passed which so well accounted for  hat the Lady's maid had told Mr Harlowe's friend Mr James Harlowe he said had certainly ends to  nswer in keeping open the breach and  as  certainly  ad formed a design to get his sister out of my hands Wherefore it as much imported his worthy friend to  eep this treaty a secret as it did me at least till he  ad formed his party and taken his measures Ill  ill and passion were dreadful misrepresenters It was amazing to him that animosity could be carried  as high against a man capable of views so pacific and  honourable and who had shewn such a command of  s temper in this whole transaction Generosity  deed in every case where love of stratagem and  trigue I would excuse him were not concerned  as a part of my character  He was proceeding when breakfast being ready  came the empress of my heart irradiating all around  er as with a gloryA benignity and graciousness in  er aspect that tho' natural to it had been long ba  ished from it  Next to prostration lowly bowed the Captain O  ow the sweet creature smiled her approbation of him  everence from one begets reverence from another  en are more of monkeys in imitation than they  hink themselvesInvoluntarily in a manner I bent  my kneeMy dearest lifeand made a very fine speech on presenting the captain to her No title myself to her lip or cheek 'tis well he attempted not eitherHe was indeed ready to worship hercould only touch her charming hand  I have told the Captain my dear creatureAnd then I briefly repeated as if I had supposed she had not heard it all I had told him  He was astonish'd that anybody could be displeased one moment with such an angel He undertook her cause as the highest degree of merit to himself  Never I must needs say did the angel so much  look  the angel All placid serene smiling selfassured A more lovely flush than usual heightening her natural graces and adding charms even to radiance to her charming complexion  After we had seated ourselves the agreeable subject was renew'd as we took our chocolate How happy should she be in her uncle's restored favour  The Captain engaged for itNo more delays he hoped of her part Let the happy day be but  once  over all would then be rightBut was it improper to ask for copies of my proposals and of her answer in order to shew them to his dear friend her uncle  As Mr Lovelace pleased  O that the dear creature would always say so  It must be in strict confidence then I saidBut would it not be better to shew her uncle the draught of the settlements when drawn  And will you  be so good  as to allow of this Mr Lovelace  There Belford We were once  The Quarrelsome  but now we are  The Polite Lovers    Indeed my dearest creature I will  if you desire it  and if Captain Tomlinson will engage that Mr Harlowe shall keep them absolutely a secret that I may not be subjected to the cavil and controul of any other of a family that have used me so very ill  Now indeed Sir you are very obliging  Dost think Jack that my face did not now also  hine  I held out my hand first consecrating it with a kiss for hers She condescended to give it me I pressed it to my lips You know not Captain Tomlinson with an air all storms overblown what a happy man  Charming couple His hands lifted upHow will my good friend rejoiceO that he were presentYou know not Madam how dear you still are to your uncle Harlowe  I am unhappy ever to have disobliged him  Not too much of that however fairest thought I  He repeated his resolutions of service and that in so acceptable a manner that the dear creature wished that neither he nor any of his might ever want a friend of equal benevolence  None of his  she said for the captain brought it in that he had five children living by one of the best of wives and mothers whose excellent management made him as happy as if his eight hundred pounds a year which was all he had to boast of were two thousand  Without  oeconomy the oraculous lady said no estate was large enough  With  it the least was not too small  Lie still teazing villain lie stillI was only speaking to my conscience Jack  And let me ask you Mr Lovelace said the Captain yet not so much from doubt as that I may proceed upon sure groundsYou are  willing  to cooperate with my dear friend in a general reconciliation  Let me tell you Mr Tomlinson that if it can be distinguished that my readiness to make up with a family of whose generosity I have not had reason to think highly is intirely owing to the value I have for this angel of a woman I will not only cooperate with Mr John Harlowe as you ask but I will meet  Mr James Harlowe senior and his lady all the way▪ And furthermore to make the son James and Arabella quite easy I will absolutely disclaim any furthe  interest whether living or dying in any of the thre  brothers estates contenting myself with what my beloved's grandfather has bequeathed to her For I hav  reason to be abundantly satisfied with my own cir+cumstances and prospectsEnough rewarded wer  she not to bring a shilling in dowry in a lady who ha  a merit superior to all the goods of fortune True a  the Gospel Belford Why had not this scene a rea  foundation  The dear creature by her eyes expressed her gra+titude before her lips could utter it O Mr Love+lace said sheYou have infinitelyAnd there sh  stopt  The Captain run over in my praise He was reall  affected  O that I had not such a mixture of revenge an  pride in my love thought IBut my old plea  cannot I make her amends at any timeAnd is no  her virtue now in the heighth of its probationWould she lay aside like the friends of my uncontending Rosebud all thought of defianceWoul  she throw herself upon my mercy and try me but on  fortnight in the Life of HonourWhat thencannot say What then  Do not despise me Jack for my inconsistencyIn no two letters perhaps agreeing with myselfWho expects consistency in men of our characterBut I am mad with loveFired by revengePuzzle with my own devicesMy inventions are my curseMy pride my punishmentDrawn five or six wa  at onceCan  she  possibly be so unhappy as  I  why why was this woman so divinely excellentYet how know I that she isWhat have been h  tryals Have I had the courage to make a single o  upon her  person  tho' fifty upon her  temper    Enough I hope to make her afraid of ever disobligeing me more  I MUST banish reflection or I am a lost man For  hese two hours past have I hated myself for my own contrivances And this not only from what I  have  related to thee but from what I have  further  to re  ate But I have now once more steeled my heart My vengeance is uppermost for I have been reperusing some of Miss Howe's virulence The contempt they have both held me in I cannot bear  The happiest breakfasttime my beloved owned that she had ever known since she had left her father's house  She might have let this alone  The Captain renewed all his protestations of service He would write me word how his dear friend received the account he should give him of the happy situation of our affairs and what he thought of the settlements as soon as I should send him the kindlypromised draughts And we parted with great professions of mutual esteem my beloved putting up vows for the success of his generous mediation  When I returned from attending the Captain down stairs which I did to the outward door my beloved met me as I entered the diningroom complacency reigning in every lovely feature  You see me already said she another creature You know not Mr Lovelace how near my heart this hopedfor reconciliation is I am now willing to banish every disagreeable remembrance You know not Sir how much you have obliged me And Oh Mr Lovelace how happy shall I be when my heart  s lightened from the allsinking weight of a father's curse When my dear mamma You don't know Sir half the excellencies of my dear mamma and what a kind heart she has when it is left to follow its own impulsesWhen this blessed mamma shall once more fold me to her indulgent bosom When I shall  again have uncles and aunts and a brother and sister all striving who shall shew most kindness and favour to the poor outcast then  no more  an outcastAnd you Mr Lovelace to behold all this and to be received into a family so dear to me with welcomeWhat tho' a little cold at first when they come to know you better and to see you oftener no fresh causes of disgust occurring and you as I hope having enter'd upon a new course all will be warmer and warmer love on both sides till every one perhaps will wonder how they came to set themselves against you  Then drying her eyes with her handkerchief after a few moments pausing on a sudden as if recollecting that she had been led by her joy to an expression of it which she had not intended I should see she retired to her chamber with precipitationLeaving me almost as unable to stand it as herself  In short I wasI want words to say how I wasMy nose had been made to tingle before my eyes have before been made to glisten by this soulmoving beauty but so  very  much affected I never wasfor trying to check my sensibility it was too strong for me and I even sobbedYes by my soul I  audibly  sobbed and was forced to turn from her before she had well finished her affecting speech  I want methinks now I have owned the odd sensation to describe it to theeThe thing was so strange to meSomething choaking as it were in my throatI know not howYet I must needs say tho' I am out of countenance upon the recollection that there was something very pretty in it and I wish I could know it again that I might have a more perfect idea of it and be better able to describe it to thee  But this effect of her joy on such an occasion gives me a high notion of what that virtue must be What other name can I call it which in a mind so capabl  of delicate transport should be able to make so charm+ing  a creature in her very bloom all frost and snow to every advance of Love from the man she hates not This must be all from Education tooMust it not Belford Can  Education  have stronger force in a woman's heart than  Nature  Sure it cannot But if it can how intirely right are parents to cultivate their daughters minds and to inspire them with notions of reserve and distance to our sex and indeed to make them think highly of their own For pride is an excellent substitute let me tell thee where virtue shines not out as the sun in its own unborrowed lustre  LETTER XLII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  AND now it is time to confess and yet I know that thy conjectures are aforehand with my exposition that this Captain Tomlinson who is so great a favourite with my charmer and who takes so much delight in healing breaches and reconciling differences is neither a greater man nor a less than honest Patrick M  c  Donald attended by a discarded footman of his own finding out  Thou knowest what a variouslifed rascal he is and to what better hopes born and educated But that ingenious knack of Forgery for which he was expelled the DublinUniversity and a detection since in Evidenceship have been his ruin For these have thrown him from one country to another and at last into the way of life which would make him a fit husband for Miss Howe's Townsend with her contrabands He is thou knowest admirably qualified for any enterprize that requires adroitness and solemnity And can there after all be a higher piece of justice aimed at than to keep one Smuggler in readiness to play against another  'Well but Lovelace methinks thou questionest how camest thou to venture upon such a contriveance  as this when as thou hast told me the Lady used to be a month at a time at this uncle's and must therefore in all probability know that there was not a Captain Tomlinson in all his neighbourhood at least no one of the name so intimate with him as this man pretends to be'    This objection Jack is so natural a one that I could not help observing to my charmer that she must surely have heard her uncle speak of this gentleman No she said she never had Besides she had not been at her uncle Harlowe's for near ten months  This I had heard her say before  And there were several gentlemen who used the same Green whom she knew not  We are all very ready thou knowest to believe what we like  And what was the reason thinkest thou that she had not been of so long time at this uncle'sWhy this old sinner who imagines himself intitled to call me to account for my freedoms with the Sex has lately fallen into familiarities as it is suspected with his housekeeper who assumes airs upon itA cursed deluding SexIn youth middle age or dotage they take us all in  Dost thou not see however that this housekeeper knows nothing nor is to know any thing of the treaty of reconciliation designed to be set on foot and therefore the Uncle always comes to the Captain the Captain goes not to the Uncle And this I surmised to the Lady And then it was a natural suggestion that the Captain was the rather applied to as he is a stranger to the rest of the family Need I tell thee the meaning of all this  But this intrigue of the  Antient  is a piece of private history the truth of which my beloved cares not to own and indeed affects to disbelieve As she does also some puisny gallantries of her foolish brother which by way of recrimination I have hinted at without naming my informant in their family  Well but methinks thou questionest again Is it not probable that Miss Howe will make inquiry after such a man as TomlinsonAnd when she cannot  I know what thou wouldst sayBut I have no doubt that Wilson will be so good if I desire it as to give into my own hands any letter that may be brought by Collins to his house for a week to come And now I hope thou'rt satisfied  I will conclude with a short story  'Two neighbouring sovereigns were at war together about some pitiful chuckfarthing thing or other no matter what for the least trifles will set princes and children at loggerheads Their armies had been drawn up in battalia some days and the news of a decisive action expected every hour to arrive at each court At last issue was joined a bloody battle was fought and a fellow who had been a spectator of it arriving with the news of a complete victory at the capital of one of the princes some time before the appointed couriers the bells were set a ringing bonfires and illuminations were made and the people went to bed intoxicated with joy and good liquor But the next day all was reversed The victorious enemy pursuing his advantage was expected every hour at the gates of the almost defenceless capital The first reporter was hereupon sought for and found and being questioned pleaded a great deal of merit in that he had in so dismal a situation taken such a space of time from the distress of his fellowcitizens and given it to festivity as were the hours between the false good news and the real bad'  Do thou Belford make the application This I know that I have given greater joy to my Beloved than she had thought would so soon fall to her share And as the human life is properly said to be chequerwork no doubt but a person of her prudence will make the best of it and set off so much good against  so much bad in order to strike as just a balance as possible  THE Lady in three several letters acquaints her friend with the most material passages and conversations contained in those of Mr Lovelace's preceding These are her words on relating what the commission of the pretended Tomlinson was after the apprehensions that his distant inquiry had given her  'At last my dear all these doubts and fears were cleared up and banished and in their place a delightful prospect was opened to me For it comes happily out but at present it must be an absolute secret for reasons which I shall mention in the sequel 'that the gentleman was sent by my uncle Harlowe I thought he could not be angry with me for ever all owing to the conversation that passed between your good Mr Hickman and him For although Mr Hickman's application was too harshly rejected at the time my uncle could not but think better of it afterwards and of the arguments that worthy gentleman used in my favour  'Who upon a passionate repulse would despair of having a reasonable request grantedWho would not by gentleness and condescension endeavour to leave favourable impressions upon an angry mind which when it comes coolly to reflect may induce it to work itself into a condescending temper To request a favour as I have often said is one thing to challenge it as our due is another And what right has a petitioner to be angry at a  repulse  if he has not a right to  demand  what he sues for as a  debt  '  She describes Captain Tomlinson on his breakfast visit to be  'a grave good sort of man'  And in another place  'A genteel man of great gravity and a good aspect she believes upwards of fifty years of age I liked him says she as soon as I saw him'  As her prospects are now more favourable than heretofore she wishes that her hopes of Mr Lovelace's so often promised reformation were better grounded than she is afraid they can be  'We have both been extremely puzzled my dear says she to reconcile some parts of Mr Lovelace's character with other parts of it His good with his bad such of the former in particular as His generosity to his tenants His bounty to the innkeeper's daughter His readiness to put me upon doing kind things by my good Norton and others  'A strange mixture in his mind as I have told him For he is certainly as I have reason to say looking back upon his past behaviour to me in twenty instances a hardhearted manIndeed my dear I have thought more than once that he had rather see me in tears than give me reason to be pleased with him  'My cousin Morden says that free livers are remorseless  Vol  III  p    See also Mr Lovelace's own confession of the delight he takes in a lady's tears in different parts of his letters particularly in p    of this Volume  And so they must be in the very nature of things  'Mr Lovelace is a proud man That we have long observed And I am truly afraid that his very generosity is more owing to his  pride  and his  vanity  than to that  philanthropy  which distinguishes a beneficent mind  'Money he values not but as a means to support his pride and his independence And it is easy as I have often thought for a person to part with a  secondary  appetite when by so doing he can promote or gratify a  first    'I am afraid my dear that there must have been some fault in his Education His natural byas was not I fancy sufficiently attended to He was instructed perhaps as his power was likely to be  large to do good and beneficent actions but not from  proper motives  I doubt  'If he  had  his generosity would not have stopt at  pride  but would have struck into  humanity  and then would he not have contented himself with doing praiseworthy things by fits and starts or as if relying on the doctrine of merits he hoped by a good action to atone for a bad one  That the Lady judges rightly of him in this place see Vol I p where giving the motive for his generosity to his Rosebud he says  'As I make it my rule whenever I have committed a very capital enormity to do some good by way of atonement and as I believe I am a pretty deal indebted on that score I intend to join an hundred pounds to Johnny's aunt's hundred pounds to make one innocent couple happy'  Besides which motive he had a further view to answer in that instance of his generosity as may be seen Vol II Letters xxiii xxiv xxv xxvi  To shew the consistence of his actions as they  now  appear with his views and principles as he lays them down in his  first letters  it may not be amiss to refer the reader to his letters Vol I Numb xxxiv p and Numb xxxv p to  See also Vol I p and for Clarissa's early opinion of Mr LovelaceWhence the coldness and indifference to him which he so repeatedly accuses her of will be accounted for more to her glory than to his honour  but he would have been uniformly noble and done the good for its  own  sake  'O my dear what a lot have I drawn  Pride  his  virtue  and  Revenge  his other predominating qualityThis one consolation however remains He is not an infidel an unbeliever Had he been an  infidel  there would have been no room at all for hope of him but priding himself as he does in his fertile invention he would have been utterly abandoned irreclaimable and a savage'  When she comes to relate those occasions which Mr Lovelace in his narrative acknowleges himself to be affected by she thus expresses herself  'He endeavoured as once before to conceal his emotion But why my dear should these men for Mr Lovelace is not singular in this think themselves above giving these beautiful proofs of a feeling  heart Were it in my power again to choose or refuse I would reject the man with contempt who sought to suppress or offered to deny the power of being affected upon  proper  occasions as either a savagehearted creature or as one who was so ignorant of the principal glory of the human nature as to place his pride in a barbarous insensibility  'These lines translated from Juvenal by Mr Tate 'I have been often pleased with  Compassion  proper  to  mankind  appears  Which nature witness'd when she lent us tears  Of tender sentiments  WE  only give  These proofs To weep is  OUR  prerogative  To shew by pitying looks and melting eyes  How with a suff'ring friend we sympathize  Who can all sense of others ills escape  Is but a brute at best in human shape  THIS natural piety  did first refine  Our wit and rais'd our thoughts to things divine  THIS  proves our spirit of the gods descent  While that of beasts is prone and downward bent  To  them  but earthborn life they did dispense  To  us  for  mutual aid  celestial sense  SHE takes notice to the advantage of the people of the house that such a good man as Captain Tomlinson had spoken well of them upon inquiry  LETTER XLIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday May    I Have a letter from Lord M Such a one as I would wish for if I intended matrimony But as matters are circumstanced I cannot think of shewing it to my Beloved  My Lord regrets  'that he is not to be the Lady's nuptial father He seems apprehensive that I have  still specious as my reasons are some mischief in my head'  He graciously consents  'that I may marry when I please and offers one or both of my cousins to assist my bride and to support her spirits on the occasion since as he understands she is so much afraid to venture with me'  'Pritchard he tells me has his final orders to draw up deeds to assign over to me in perpetuity  l per annum  which he will execute the same hour that the Lady in person owns her marriage'  He consents  'that the jointure be made from my own estate'  He wishes  'that the Lady would have accepted of his draught and commends me for tendering it to her But reproaches me for pride in not keeping it myself  What the rightside gives up the left  he says  may be the better for  '  The girls he means  With all my heart If I can have Miss Clarissa Harlowe the devil take every thing else  A good deal of other stuff writes this stupid Peer scribbling in several places half a dozen lines apparently for no other reason but to bring in as many musty words in an old saw  If thou askest How I can manage since my Beloved will wonder that I have not an answer from my Lord to such a letter as I wrote to him and if I own I have one will expect that I should shew it to her as I did my letterThis I answerThat I can be informed by Pritchard that my Lord has the gout in his righthand and has ordered him to attend me in form for my particular orders about the transfer And I can see Pritchard thou knowest at the King's Arms or where I please in town and he by word of mouth can acquaint me with everything in my Lord's letter that is necessary for her to know  Whenever it suits me I can restore the old Peer to  his right hand and then can make him write a much more sensible letter than this he has how sent me  Thou knowest that an adroitness in the art of  manual imitation  was one of my earliest attainments It has been said on this occasion that had I been a  bad  man in  meum  and  tuum  matters I should not have been fit to live As to the girls we hold it no sin to cheat them And are we not told that in being  well  deceived consists the whole of human happiness  Wednesday May    ALL still happier and happier A very high honour done me A chariot instead of a coach permitted purposely to indulge me in the subject of subjects  Our discourse in this sweet airing turned upon our future manner of life The day is bashfully promised me  Soon  was the answer to my repeated urgency Our equipage our servants our liveries were parts of the delightful subject A desire that the wretch who had given me intelligence out of the family honest Joseph Leman might not be one of our menials and her resolution to have her faithful Hannah whether recovered or not were signified and both as readily assented to  The reconciliation prospect was enlarged upon If her uncle Harlowe will but pave the way to it and if it can be brought about she shall be happyHappy with a sigh  as it is Now possible she can be  She won't forbear Jack  I told her that I had heard from Pritchard just before we set out and expected him in town tomorrow from Lord M to take my directions I spoke with gratitude of my Lord's kindness to me and with pleasure of my aunt's and cousin's veneration for her As also of his Lordship's concern that his gout hinder'd him from writing a reply with his own hand to my last  She pitied my Lord She pitied poor Mrs Fretcliville  too for she had the goodness to inquire after her The dear creature pitied everybody that seemed to want pity Happy in her own prospects she has leisure to look abroad and wishes everybody equally happy  It is likely to go very hard with Mrs Fretchville Her face which she had valued herself upon will be utterly ruin'd This good however she may reap from so great an evilAs the greater malady generally swallows up the less she may have a grief on this occasion that may diminish the other grief and make it tolerable  I had a gentle reprimand for this light turn on so heavy an evilFor what was the loss of beauty to the loss of a good husbandExcellent creature  Her hopes and her pleasure upon those hopes that Miss Howe's mother would be reconciled to her were also mentioned  Good  Mrs Howe was her word for a woman so covetous and so remorseless in her covetousness that no one else would call her  good  But this dear creature has such an extension in her love as to be capable of valuing the most insignificant animal related to those whom she respects  Love me and love my dog  I have heard Lord M sayWho knows but that I may in time in compliment to myself bring her to think well of thee Jack  But what am I aboutAm I not all this time arraigning my own heartI know I am by the remorse I feel in it while my pen bears testimony to her excellence But yet I must add for no selfish consideration shall hinder me from doing justice to this admirable creature that in this conversation she demonstrated so much prudent knowlege in every thing that relates to that part of the domestic management which falls under the care of a mistress of a family that I believe she has no equal of her years in the world  I break off to reperuse some of Miss Howe's virulence  Cursed letters these of Miss Howe JackDo thou turn back to those of mine where I take notice of them  I proceed  Upon the whole my charmer was all gentleness all ease all serenity throughout this sweet excursion Nor had she reason to be otherwise For it being the first time that I had the honour of her company  sola  I was resolved to encourage her by my respectfulness to repeat the favour  On our return I found the counsellor's clerk waiting for me with a draught of the marriagesettlements  They are drawn with only the necessary variations from those made for my mother The original of which now returned by the counsellor as well as the new draughts I have put into my Beloved's hands  This made the lawyer's work easy nor can she have a better precedent the great Lord S having settled them at the request of my mother's relations all the difference my charmer's are  l per annum  more than my mother's  I offer'd to read to her the old deed while she looked over the draught for she had refused her presence at the examination with the clerk But this she also declined  I suppose she did not care to hear of so many children first second third fourth fifth sixth and seventh sons and as many daughters  to be begotten upon the body of the said Clarissa Harlowe    Charming matrimonial recitativoestho' it is always said  lawfully begotten  tooAs if a man could beget children  unlawfully  upon the body of his own wifeBut thinkest thou not that these arch rogues the lawyers hereby intimate that a man may have children by his wife  before  marriageThis must be what they mean Why will these sly fellows put an honest man in mind of such rogueriesBut hence  as in numberless other instances we see that  Law  and  Gospel  are two very different things  Dorcas in our absence tried to get at the wainscot box in the dark closet But it cannot be done without violence And to run a risque of consequence now for mere curiositysake would be inexcusable  Mrs Sinclair and the nymphs are all of opinion that I am now so much of a favourite and have such a visible share in her confidence and even in her affections that I may do what I will and plead violence of  passion  which they will have it makes violence of  action  pardonable with their sex as well as an allowed extenuation with the unconcerned of both sexes and they all offer their helping hands Why not they say Has she not passed for my wife before them allAnd is she not in a fine way of being reconciled to her friends which was the pretence for postponing consummation  They again urge me since it is so difficult to make  night  my friend to an attempt in the  day  They remind me that the situation of their house is such that no noises can be heard out of it and ridicule me for making it necessary for a lady to be undressed It was not always so with me poor old man Sally told me saucily flinging her handkerchief in my face  LETTER XLIV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Friday June    NOtwithstanding my studied for politeness and complaisance for some days past and though I have wanted courage to throw the mask quite aside yet I have made the dear creature more than once look about her by the warm tho' decent expressions of my passion I have brought her to own that I am  more  than indifferent to her But as to LOVE which I pressed her to acknowlege  What need of acknowlegements of that sort when a woman consents to marry  And once repulsing me with displeasure  The proof of the true love I was vowing for her was  respect  not  freedom And offering to defend myself she told me that all the conception she had been able to form of a faulty passion was that it must demonstrate itself as mine sought to do  I endeavoured to justify my passion by laying overdelicacy at her door That was  not  she said  my  fault if it were  hers  She must plainly tell me that I appeared to her incapable of distinguishing what were the requisites of a pure mind Perhaps had the  libertine  presumption to imagine that there was no difference in  heart  nor any but what proceeded from  education  and  custom  between the pure and the impureAnd yet custom  alone  as she observed would make a second nature as well in good as in bad habits  I HAVE just now been called to account for some innocent liberties which I thought myself intitled to take before the women as they suppose us married and now within view of consummation  I took the lecture very hardly and with impatience wish'd for the happy day and hour when I might call her all my own and meet with no check from a niceness that had no example  She looked at me with a bashful kind of contempt I thought it  contempt  and required the reason for it not being conscious of offence as I told her  This is not the first time Mr Lovelace said she that I have had cause to be displeased with you when  you  perhaps have not thought yourself exceptionableBut Sir let me tell you that the married state in my eye is a state of purity and I think she told me not of  licentiousness  so at least I understood her  Marriagepurity  JackVery comical 'faithYet sweet dears half the female world ready to run away with a rake  because  he is a rake and for no  other  reason nay every other reason  against  their choice  But have not you and I Belford seen young wives who would be thought modest and when maids were fantastically shy permit freedoms in public from their  lambent  husbands which have shewn that they have forgot what belongs either to prudence or decency While every modest eye has sunk under the shameless effrontery and every modest face been covered with blushes for those who could not blush  I once upon such an occasion proposed to a circle of a dozen thus scandalized to withdraw since they must needs see that as well the  lady  as the gentleman wanted to be in private This motion had its effect upon the amorous pair and I was applauded for the check given to their licentiousness  But upon another occasion of this sort I acted a little more in characterFor I ventured to make an attempt upon a bride which I should not have had the courage to make had not the unblushing passiveness with which she received her fond husband's public toyings looking round her with triumph rather than with shame upon every lady present incited my curiosity to know if the same complacency might not be shewn to a private friend 'Tis true I was in honour obliged to keep the secret But I never saw the turtles bill afterwards but I thought of Number Two to the same female and in my heart thanked the fond husband for the lesson he had taught his wife  From what I have said thou wilt see that I approve of my beloved's exception to  public  loves That I hope is all the charming Isicle means by  marriagepurity    From the whole of the above thou wilt gather that I have not been a mere dangler a Hickman in  the passed days though not absolutely active and a Lovelace  The dear creature now considers herself as my wifeelect The  unsadden'd  heart no longer prudish will not now I hope give the fable turn to every action of the man she dislikes not And yet she must keep up so much reserve as will justify past inflexibilities Many and many a pretty soul would yield were she not afraid that the man she favoured would think the worse of her for it This is also a part of the Rake's Creed But should she resent ever so strongly she cannot now break with me since if she does there will be an end of the family reconciliation and that in a way highly discreditable to herself  Sat June    JUST returned from DoctorsCommons I have been endeavouring to get a licence Very true Jack I have the mortification to find a difficulty in obtaining this allfettering instrument as the Lady is of rank and fortune and as there is no consent of father or  next friend    I made report of this difficulty It is very right she says that such difficulties should be made But not to a man of my known fortune surely Jack tho' the woman were the daughter of a duke  I asked If she approved of the settlements She said She had compared them with my mother's and had no objection She had written to Miss Howe upon the subject she owned and to inform her of our present situation  As this Letter of the Lady contains no new matter but what may be collected from those of Mr Lovelace it is omitted    JUST now in high good humour my beloved returned me the draughts of the settlements a copy of which I had sent to Captain Tomlinson She complimented me that she never had any doubt of my  honour in cases of this natureIn matters between man and man nobody ever had thou knowest I had need thou'lt say to have some good qualities  Great faults and great virtues are often found in the same person In nothing  very  bad but as to women And did not one of them begin with me  See Vol  I  Letter  xxxi  p      We have held that women have no souls I am a very Jew in this point and willing to believe they have not And if so to whom shall I be accountable for what I do to them Nay if souls they have as there is no sex in Ethereals nor need of any what plea can a lady hold of injuries done her in her lady  state  when there is an end of her lady  ship  LETTER XLV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday June    I Am now almost in despair of succeeding with this charming frostpiece by love or gentlenessA copy of the draughts as I told thee has been sent to Captain Tomlinson and that by a special messenger Ingrossments are proceeding with I have been again at the Commons Should in all probability have procured a licence by Malory's means had not Malory's friend the proctor been suddenly sent for to Cheshunt to make an old lady's will Pritchard has told me by word of mouth  though my charmer saw him not  all that was necessary for her to know in the letter my Lord wrote which I could not shew her and taken my directions about the estates to be made over to me on my nuptialsYet with all these favourable appearances no conceding moment to be sound no improveable tenderness to be raised  Twice indeed with rapture which once she called rude did I salute her and each time resenting the freedom did she retire tho' to do her justice she  favoured me again with her presence at my first intreaty and took no notice of the cause of her withdrawing  Is it policy to shew so open a resentment for innocent liberties which in her situation she must so soon forgive  Yet the woman who resents not initiatory freedoms must be lost  For Love is an incroacher Love never goes backward Love is always aspiring Always must aspire Nothing but the highest act of Love can satisfy an indulged Love And what advantages has a lover who values not breaking the peace over his mistress who is solicitous to keep it  I have now at this instant wrought myself up for the dozenth time to a halfresolution A thousand agreeable things I have to say to her She is in the diningroom Just gone up She always expects me when there  HIGH displeasurefollowed by an abrupt departure  I sat down by her I took both her hands in mine I would  have  it so All gentle my voiceHer father mentioned with respect Her mother with reverence Even her brother amicably spoken of I never thought I could have wished so ardently as I told her I did wish for a reconciliation with her family  A sweet and grateful flush then overspread her fair face a gentle sigh nowandthen heaved her handkerchief  I perfectly long'd to hear from Captain Tomlinson It was impossible for her uncle to find fault with the draught of the settlements I would not however be understood by sending them down that I intended to put it in her uncle's power to delay my happy day When when was it to be  I would hasten again to the Commons and would not return without the licence  The Lawn I proposed to retire to as soon as the happy ceremony was over This day and that day I proposed  It was time enough to name the day when the settlements were completed and the licence obtained Happy should she be could the kind Captain Tomlinson obtain her uncle's presence privately  A good hintIt may perhaps be improved uponEither for a  delay  or a  pacifier    No new delays for heaven's sake I besought her reproaching her gently for the past Name but the dayan early day I hoped in the following weekthat I might hail its approach and number the tardy hours  My cheek reclined on her shoulderkissing her hands by turns Rather bashfully than angrily reluctant her hands sought to be withdrawn her shoulder avoiding my reclined cheekApparently loth and more loth to quarrel with me her downcast eye confessing more than her lips could utterNow surely thought I it is my time to try if she can forgive a still bolder freedom than I had ever yet taken  I then gave her struggling hands liberty I put one arm round her waist I imprinted a kiss on her sweet lips with a  Be quiet  only and an averted face as if she feared another  Encouraged by so gentle a repulse the tenderest things I said and then with my other hand drew aside the handkerchief that concealed the beauty of beauties and pressed with my burning lips the charmingest breast that ever my ravished eyes beheld  A very contrary passion to that which gave her bosom so delightful a swell immediately took place She struggled out of my incircling arms with indignation I detained her reluctant hand Let me go said she I see there is no keeping terms with you Base incroacher Is this the design of your flattering speechesFar as matters have gone I will  for ever renounce you You have an odious heart Let me go I tell you  I was forced to obey and she flung from me repeating  base  and adding  flattering  incroacher  IN vain have I urged by Dorcas for the promised favour of dining with her She would not dine  at all  She  could not    But why makes she every inch of her person thus sacredSo near the time too that she must suppose that all will be my own by deed of purchase and settlement  She has read no doubt of the art of the Eastern monarchs who sequester themselves from the eyes of their subjects in order to excite their adoration when upon some solemn occasions they think fit to appear in public  But let me ask thee Belford whether on these solemn occasions the preceding cavalcade here a great officer and there a great minister with their satellites and glaring equipages do not prepare the eyes of the wondering beholders by degrees to bear the blaze of canopy'd majesty what tho' but an ugly old man perhaps himself yet glittering in the collected riches of his vast empire  And should not my beloved for her own sake descend by  degrees  from  goddesshood  into  humanity  If it be  pride  that restrains her ought not that pride to be punished If as in the Eastern emperors it be  art  as well as  pride art  is what she of all women need not use If  shame  what a shame to be ashamed to communicate to her adorer's sight the most admirable of her personal graces  Let me perish Belford if I would not forego the brightest diadem in the world for the pleasure of seeing a TwinLovelace at each charming breast drawing from it his first sustenance the pious task continued for one month and no more  I now methinks behold this most charming of women in this sweet office pressing with her fine fingers the generous flood into the purple mouths of each eager hunter by turns Her conscious eye now dropt on one now on the other with a sigh of maternal tenderness and then raised up to my delighted eye full of wishes for the sake of the pretty varlets and for her own sake that I would deign to legitimate that I would condescend to put on the nuptial fetters  LETTER XLVI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday P M  A Letter received from the worthy Captain Tomlinson has introduced me into the presence of my charmer sooner than perhaps I should otherwise have been admitted  Sullen her brow at her first entrance into the dineingroom But I took no notice of what had passed and her anger slid away upon its own ice  'The Captain after letting me know that he chose not to write till he had the promised draught of the settlements acquaints me that his friend Mr John Harlowe in their first conference which was held as soon as he got down was extremely surprized and even grieved as he feared he would be to hear that we were not married The world he said who knew my character would be very c  nsorious were it owned that we had lived so long together unmarried in the same lodgings altho' our marriage were now to be ever so publicly celebrated'  'His nephew James he was sure would make a great handle of it against any motion that might be made towards a reconciliation and with the greater  success as there was not a family in the kingdom more jealous of their honour than theirs'  This is true of the Harlowes Jack They have been called  The proud Harlowes  And I have ever found that all young Honour is supercilious and touchy  But seest thou not how right I was in my endeavour to persuade my fair one to allow her uncle's friend to think us married especially as he came  prepared  to believe it and as her uncle  hoped  it was soBut nothing on earth is so perverse as a woman when she is set upon carrying a point and has a  meek  man or one who loves his  peace  to deal with  My Beloved was vexed She pulled out her handkerchief But was more inclined to blame me than herself  Had you kept your word Mr Lovelace and left me when we came to townAnd there she stopt for she knew that it was her own fault that we were not marry'd before we left the country and how could I leave her afterwards while her brother was plotting to carry her off by violence  Nor has he yet given over his machinations  For as the Captain proceeds  'Mr John Harlowe owned to him but in confidence that his nephew is at this time busied in endeavouring to find out where we are being assured as I am not to be heard of at any of my relations or at my usual lodgings that we are together And that we are not married is plain as he will have it from Mr Hickman's application so lately made to her uncle and which was seconded by Mrs Norton to her mother And he cannot bear that I should enjoy such a triumph unmolested'  A profound sigh and the handkerchief again lifted to the eye But did not the sweet soul deserve this turn upon her for her felonious intention to rob me of herself  I read on to the following effect  'Why Mr Harlowe asked was it said to his other inquiring friend that we  were  married and that by his niece's woman who ought to know Who could give  convincing  reasons no doubt'    Here again she wept took a turn cross the room then returnedRead on said she  Will you my dearest life read it yourself  I will take the letter with me byandbyI cannot  see  to read it just now wiping her eyesRead onLet me hear it allthat I may know your sentiments upon this letter as well as give my own  'The Captain then told uncle John the reasons that induced me to give out that we were married and the conditions on which my Beloved was brought to countenance it which had kept us at the most punctilious distance  'But still my character was insisted upon And Mr Harlowe went away dissatisfied And the Captain was also so much concerned that he cared not to write what the result of this first conference was  'But in the next which was held on receipt of the draughts at his the Captain's house as the former was for the greater secrecy when the old gentleman had read them and had the Captain's opinion he was much better pleased And yet he declared that it would not be easy to persuade any other person of his family to believe so favourably of the matter as he was  now  willing to believe were they to know that we had lived so long together unmarried  'And then the Captain says his dear friend made a proposalIt was this  That we should marry  of hand but as privately as possible as indeed h  found we intended  for he could have no objection to the draughts  But yet he expected to have pr  sent one trusty friend of his own for his better satisfaction    Here I stopt with a design to be angryBut she desiring me to read on I obeyed  'But  that it should pass to every one living except to that trusty person to himself and to the Captain that we were married from the time that we had lived together in one house and that this time should be made to agree with that of Mr Hickman's application to him from Miss Howe  '  This my dearest life said I is a very considerate proposal We have nothing to do but to caution the people below properly on this head I did not think your uncle Harlowe capable of such an expedient But you see how much his heart is in the reconciliation  This was the return I met withYou have always as a mark of your politeness let me know how  meanly  you think of every one of my family  Yet thou wilt think Belford that I could forgive her for the reproach  'The Captain does not know he says how this proposal will be relished by us But for his part he thinks it an expedient that will obviate many difficulties and may possibly put an end to Mr James Harlowe's further designs And on this account he has by the uncle's advice already declared to two several persons by whose means it may come to that young gentleman's ears that he Captain Tomlinson has very great reason to believe that we were married soon after Mr Hickman's application was rejected  'And this Mr Lovelace says the Captain will enable you to pay a compliment to the family that will not be unsuitable to the generosity of some of the declarations you was pleased to make to the Lady before me and which Mr John Harlowe may make some advantage of in favour of a reconciliation in that you have not demanded your lady's estate so soon as you were intitled to make the demand'  An excellent contriver surely she must think this worthy Mr Tomlinson to be  'But the Captain adds that if either the Lady or I disapprove of his report of our marriage he will retract it Nevertheless he must tell me that Mr John Harlowe is very much set upon this way of proceeding as the only one in his opinion capable of being improved into a general reconciliation But if we do acquiesce in it he beseeches my fair one not to suspend my day that he may be authorized in what he says as to the truth of the main fact How conscientious this good man Nor must it be expected he says that her uncle will take one step towards the wishedfor reconciliation till the  solemnity is actually over    He adds  'that he shall be very soon in town on other affairs and then proposes to attend us and give us a more particular account of all that passed or shall further pass between Mr Harlowe and him'  Well my dearest life what say you to your uncle's expedient Shall I write to the Captain and acquaint him that we have no objection to it  She was silent for a few minutes At last with a sighSee Mr Lovelace said she what you have brought me to by treading after you in such crooked pathsSee what disgrace I have incurredIndeed you have not acted like a wise man  My beloved creature do you not remember how earnestly I besought the honour of your hand before we came to townHad I been  then  favoured  Well well SirThere has been much amiss somewhere that's all I will say at present And since what's past cannot be recalled my uncle must be obeyed I think  Charmingly dutifulI had nothing then to do that I might not be behindhand with the worthy Captain and her uncle but to press for the day This  fervently did But as I might have expected her former answer was repeated That when the settlements were completed when the licence was actually obtained it would be time enough to name the day And O Mr Lovelace said she turning from me with a grace inimitably tender her handkerchief at her eyes what a happiness if my dear uncle could be prevailed upon to be personally a father on this occasion to  the poor fatherless girl    What's the matter with meWhence this dewdropA tearAs I hope to be saved it is a tear JackVery ready methinksOnly on recitingBut her lively image was before me in the very attitude she spoke the wordsAnd indeed at the  time  she spoke them these lines of Shakespeare came into my head  Thy heart is big Get thee apart and weep  Passion I see is catchingFor my eyes  Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine  Begin to water  I withdrew and wrote to the Captain to the following effect  'That he would be so good as to acquaint his dear friend that we intirely acquiesced with what he had proposed and had already  properly  cautioned the gentlewomen of the house and their servants as well as our own That if he would in person give me the blessing of his dear niece's hand it would crown the wishes of both That his own day in this case as I presumed it would be a short one should be ours That by this means the secret would be in fewer hands That I myself thought the ceremony could not be too privately performed and this not only for the sake of the wise end he had intended to be answered by it but because I would not have Lord M think himself slighted as he had once intended as I had told him to be our nuptial father had we not declined his offer in order  to avoid a public wedding which his beloved niece would not come into while she was in disgrace with her friendsBut that if he chose not to do us this honour I wished that Captain Tomlinson might be the trusty person whom he would have to be present on the happy occasion'  I shewed this letter to my fair one She was not displeased with it So Jack we cannot now move too fast as to Settlements and License The day is her  Uncle's day  or  Captain Tomlinson's  perhaps as shall best suit the occasion Miss Howe's Smuggling scheme is now surely provided against in all events  But I will not by anticipation make thee a judge of all the benefits that may flow from this my elaborate contrivance Why will these girls put me upon my  masterstrokes  And now for a little mine which I am getting ready to spring The  first  and at the rate I go on now a  resolution  and now a  remorse  perhaps the  last    A  little  mine I call it But it may be attended with great effects I shall not however absolutely depend upon the success of it having much more effectual ones in reserve And yet great engines are often moved by little springs A small spark falling by accident into a powdermagazine has sometimes done more execution than an hundred cannon  Come the worst to the worst the  hymeneal torch  and a  white sheet  must be my  amende honorable  as the French have it  LETTER XLVII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday June    UNSUCCESSFUL as hitherto my application to thee has been I cannot for the heart of me forbear writing once more in behalf of this admirable  woman And yet am unable to account for the zeal which impels me to take her part with an earnestness so sincere  But all her merit thou acknowlegest all thy own vileness thou confessest and even gloriest in it what hope then of moving so harden'd a manYet as it is not too late and thou art nevertheless upon the crisis I am resolved to try what another letter will do It is but my writing in vain if it do no good and if thou wilt let me prevail I know thou wilt hereafter think me richly intitled to thy thanks  To  argue  with thee would be folly The case cannot require it I will only  intreat  thee therefore that thou wilt not let such an excellence lose the reward of her vigilant virtue  I believe there never were libertines so vile but purposed at some future period of their lives to set about reforming and let me beg of thee that thou wilt in this great article make thy future repentance as easy as some time hence thou wilt wish thou  hadst  made it If thou proceedest I have no doubt that this affair will end tragically one way or other It must Such a woman must interest both gods and men in her cause But what I most apprehend is that with her own hand in resentment of the perpetrated outrage she like another Lucretia will assert the purity of her heart Or if her piety preserve her from this violence that wasting grief will soon put a period to her days And in either case will not the remembrance of thy  everduring  guilt and  transitory  triumph be a torment of torments to thee  'Tis a seriously sad thing after all that so fine a creature should have fallen into such vile and remorseless hands For from thy cradle as I have heard thee own thou ever delightedst to sport with and torment the animal whether bird or beast that thou lovedst and hadst a power over  How different is the case of this fine woman from  that of any other whom thou hast seduced I need not mention to thee nor insist upon the striking difference Justice gratitude thy interest thy vows all engaging thee and thou certainly loving her as far as thou art capable of love above all her sex She not to be drawn aside by art or to be made to suffer from credulity nor for want of wit and discernment that will be another cutting reflection to so fine a mind as hers The contention between you only unequal as it is between naked innocence and armed guilt In every thing else as thou ownest her talents greatly superior to thineWhat a fate will hers be if thou art not at last overcome by thy reiterated remorses  At first indeed when I was admitted into her presence  See Vol  III  p    and till I observed her meaning air and heard her speak I supposed that she had no very uncommon  judgment  to boast of For I made as I thought but  just  allowances for her blossoming youth and for that loveliness of person and easiness of dress which I imagined must have taken up half her time and study to cultivate and yet I had been prepared by thee to entertain a very high opinion of her sense and her reading Her choice of this gay fellow upon such hazardous terms thought I is a confirmation that her  wit  wants that maturity which only  years  and  experience  can give it Her  knowlege  argued I to myself must be all  theory  and the complaisance ever consorting with an age so green and so gay will make so inexperienced a lady at least forbear to shew herself  disgusted  at freedoms of discourse in which those present of her own sex and some of ours so learned so well read and so travelled allow themselves  In this presumption I run on and having the advantage as I conceited of all the company but thee and being desirous to appear in her eyes a mighty clever fellow I thought I  shewed away  when I said any foolish things that had more sound than sense  them and when I made silly jests which attracted the smiles of thy Sinclair and the specious Partington and that Miss Harlowe did not smile too I thought was owing to her youth or affectation or to a mixture of both perhaps to a greater command of her featuresLittle dreamt I that I was incurring her contempt all the time  But when as I said I heard her speak which she did not till she had fathomed us all when I heard her sentiments on two or three subjects and took notice of that searching eye darting into the very inmost cells of our frothy brains by my faith it made me look about me and I began to recollect and be ashamed of all I had said before in short was resolved to sit silent till every one had talk'd round to keep my folly in countenance And then I raised the subjects that she  could  join in and which she  did  join in so much to the confusion and surprize of everyone of usFor even thou Lovelace so noted for smart wit repartee and a vein of raillery that delighteth all who come near thee sattest in palpable darkness and lookedst about thee as well as we  One instance only of this shall I remind thee of  We talked of  wit  and of  wit  and aimed at it bandying it like a ball from one to another of us and resting it chiefly with thee who wert always proud enough and vain enough of the attribute and then more especially as thou hadst assembled us as far as I know principally to shew the lady thy superiority over us and us thy triumph over her And then Tourville who is always satisfied with wit at secondhand wit upon memory other mens with repeated some verses as applicable to the subject which two of us applauded tho' full of double entendre Thou seeing the lady's serious air on one of those repetitions appliedst thyself to her desiring her notions of wit A quality thou saidst which every one prized whether flowing from himself or found in another  Then it was she took all our attentionIt was a quality much talked of she said but she believed very little understoodAt least if she might be so free as to give her judgment of it from what had passed in the present conversation she must say that Wit with Gentlemen was one thing with Ladies another  This startled us allHow the women lookedHow they pursed in their mouths a broad smile the moment before upon each from the verses they had heard repeated so well understood as we saw by their looksWhile I besought her to let us know for our instruction what Wit was with  Ladies  For such I was sure it  ought  to be with  Gentlemen    Cowley she said had defined it prettily by negatives  Thou desiredst her to repeat his definition  She did and with so much graceful ease and beauty and propriety of accent as would have made bad poetry delightful  A thousand diff'rent shapes it bears  Comely in thousand shapes appears  'Tis not a  tale  'Tis not a  jest  Admir'd  with laughter  at a  feast  Nor  florid talk  which must this title gain  The proofs of wit for  ever  must remain  Much less can that have any place  At which a virgin hides her face  Such dross the fire must purge away'Tis just  The author blush there where the reader must  Here she stopt looking round her upon us all with conscious superiority as I thought Lord how we star'd Thou attemptedst to give us thy definition of wit that thou mightest have something to say and not seem to be surprised into silent modesty  But as if she cared not to trust thee with the subject referring to the same author as for his more positive  decision she thus with the same harmony of voice and accent emphatically decided upon it  Wit  like a luxuriant vine  Unless to  Virtue  's prop it join  Firm and erect tow'rd heaven bound  Tho' it with beauteous leaves and pleasant fruit be crown'd  It lies deform'd and rotting on the ground  If thou recollectest this part of the conversation and how like fools we looked at one another How much it put us out of conceit with ourselves and made us  fear  her when we found our conversation thus excluded from the very character which our vanity had made us think unquestionably ours And if thou profitest properly by the recollection thou wilt be of my mind that there is not so much wit in wickedness as we had flattered ourselves there was  And after all I have been of opinion ever since  that  conversation that the wit of all the rakes and libertines I ever convers'd with from the brilliant Bob Lovelace down to little Johnny Hartop the punster consists mostly in saying bold and shocking things with such courage as shall make Modest people blush the Impudent laugh and the Ignorant stare  And why dost thou think I mention these things so malàpropos as it may seemOnly let me tell thee as an instance among many that might be given from the same evening's conversation of this fine l  dy's superiority in those talents which ennoble nature and dignify her sex Evidenced not only to each of us as we offended but to the flippant Partington and the grosser but egregiously hypocritical Sinclair in the correcting eye the discouraging blush in which was mixed as much displeasure as modesty and sometimes as the occasion called for it for we were some of us hardened above the sense of feeling  delicate  reproof  by the sovereign contempt mingled with a disdainful kind of pity that shewed at once her own conscious worthy and our despicable worthlesness  O Lovelace what then was the triumph even in my eye and what is it still upon reflection of  true  modesty of  true  wit and  true  politeness over frothy jest laughing impertinence and an obscenity so shameful even to the guilty that they cannot hint at it but under a double meaning  Then as thou hast somewhere observed all her correctives  avowed  by her eye Not poorly like the generality of her sex affecting ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed but so resenting as to shew each impudent laugher the offence given to and taken by a purity that had mistaken its way when it fell into such company  Such is the woman such is the angel whom thou hast betrayed into thy power and wouldst deceive and ruinSweet creature did she but know how she is surrounded as I then thought as well as now think and what is  intended  how much sooner would death be her choice than so dreadful a situationAnd how effectually would her story were it generally known warn all the Sex against throwing themselves into the power of ours let our vows oaths and protestations be what they will  But let me beg of thee once more my dear Lovelace if thou hast any regard for thy honour for the honour of thy family for thy future peace or for my opinion of thee who yet pretend not to be so much moved by principle as by that dazling merit which ought still more to attract  thee  to be prevailed uponto beto be  humane  that's allOnly that thou wouldest not disgrace our common humanity  Hardened as thou art I know that they are the abandoned people in the house who keep thee up to a resolution against her O that the sagacious fair one  with so much innocent charity in her own heart had not so resolutely held those women at distanceThat as she boarded there she had oftener tabled with them Specious as they are in a week's time she would have seen thro' them they could not have been always so guarded as they were when they saw her but seldom and when they prepared themselves to see her and she would have fled their house as a place infected And yet perhaps with so determined an enterprizer this discovery might have accelerated her ruin  I know that thou art nice in thy loves But are there not hundreds of women who tho' not utterly abandoned would be taken with thee for mere  personal  regards Make a toy if thou wilt of principle with regard to such of the Sex as regard it as a toy but rob not an angel of those purities which in her own opinion constitute the difference between angelic and brutal qualities  With regard to the passion itself the less of soul in either man or woman the more sensual are they Thou Lovelace hast a soul tho' a corrupted one and art more intent as thou even gloriest upon the preparative stratagem than upon the end of conquering  See we not the natural bent of idiots and the crazedThe very appetite is  body  and when we ourselves are most fools and crazed then are we most eager in these pursuits See what fools this passion makes the wisest men What snivellers what dotards when they suffer themselves to be run away with by itAn  unpermanent passion  Since if ashamed of its  more proper  name we must call it  Love Love gratified is Love satisfiedAnd Love satisfied is Indifference begun  And this is the case where  consent  on one side adds to the obligation on the other What then but remorse can follow a forcible attempt  Do not even chaste lovers choose to be alone in their courtship preparations ashamed to have even a child to witness to their foolish actions and more foolish expressionsIs this deified passion in its greatest altitudes fitted to stand the dayDo not the lovers when mutual consent awaits their wills retire to coverts and to darkness to complete their wishes And shall such a sneaking passion as this which can be so easily gratified by viler objects be permitted to debase the noblest  Were not the delays of thy vile purposes owing more to the awe which her majestic virtue has inspired thee with than to thy want of adroitness in villainy I  must  write my free sentiments in this case for have I not  seen  the angel I should be ready to censure some of thy contrivances and pretences to suspend the expected day as  trite stale  and to me who know thy intention  poor  and too often resorted to as nothing comes of them to be gloried in particularly that of Mennell the vapourish lady and the readyfurnished house  She must have thought so too at times and in her heart despised thee for them or love thee ingrateful as thou art to her misfortune as well as entertain hope against probability But this would afford another warning to the Sex were they to know her story as it would shew them what poor pretences they must  seem  to be satisfied with if once they put themselves into the power of a designing man  If  trial  only was thy end as once was thy pretence  See Vol  III  Letter  xvii  enough surely hast thou tried this paragon of virtue and vigilance But I knew thee too well to expect at the  time  that thou wouldest stop there Men of our cast whenever they form a design upon any of the Sex put no other bound to their views than what want of power gives them I knew that from one advantage gained thou wouldest proceed to  attempt another Thy habitual aversion to wedlock too well I knew and indeed thou avowest thy hope to bring her to  cohabitation  in that very letter in which thou pretendest  trial  to be thy principal view  Vol  III  p      But do not even thy own frequent and involuntary remorses when thou hast time place company and every other circumstance to favour thee in thy wicked design convince thee that there can be no room for a hope so presumptuousWhy then since thou wouldst choose to marry her rather than lose her wilt thou make her hate thee for ever  But if thou darest to meditate  personal  trial and art sincere in thy resolution to reward her as she behaves in it let me beseech thee to remove her from this vile house That will be to give her and thy conscience fair play So intirely now does the sweet deluded excellence depend upon her supposed happier prospects that thou needest not to fear that she will fly from thee or that she will wish to have recourse to that scheme of Miss Howe which has put thee upon what thou callest thy  masterstrokes    But whatever be thy determination on this head and if I write not in time but that thou hast actually pulled off the mask let it not be one of thy devices if thou wouldst avoid the curses of every heart and hereafter of thy own to give her no not for one hour be her resentment ever so great into the power of that villainous woman who has if possible less remorse than thyself and whose  trade  it is to break the resisting spirit and utterly to ruin the heart unpractised in evilO Lovelace Lovelace how many dreadful stories could this horrid woman tell the Sex And shall that of Miss Clarissa Harlowe swell the guilty list  But this I might have spared Of this devil as  thou art thou canst not be capable Thou couldst not enjoy a triumph so disgraceful to thy wicked pride as well as to humanity  Shouldst thou think that the melancholy spectacle hourly before me has made me more serious than usual perhaps thou wilt not be mistaken But nothing more is to be inferr'd from hence were I even to return to my former courses but that whenever the time of cool reflection comes whether brought on by our own disasters or by those of others we shall undoubtedly if capable of thought and if we have time for it think in the same manner  We neither of us are such fools as to disbelieve a futurity or to think whatever be our practice that we came hither by chance and for no end but to do all the mischief that we have in our power to doNor am I ashamed to own that in the prayers which my poor uncle makes me read to him in the absence of a very good clergyman who regularly attends him I do not forget to put in a word or two for myself  If Lovelace thou laughest at me thy ridicule will be more conformable to thy  actions  than to thy  beliefDevils believe and tremble  Canst thou be more abandoned than they  And here let me add with regard to my poor old man that I often wish thee present but for one half hour in a day to see the dregs of a gay life running off in the most excruciating tortures that the colic the stone and the gangrene can unitedly inflict and to hear him bewail the dissoluteness of his past life in the bitterest anguish of a spirit every hour expecting to be called to its last accountYet by all his confessions he has not to accuse himself in sixtyseven years of life of half the  very  vile enormities which you and I have committed in the last seven only  I conclude with recommending to thy serious consideration  all I have written as proceeding from the heart and soul of  Thy assured friend  JOHN BELFORD  LETTER XLVIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday P M June    DIfficulties still to be got over in procuring this plaguy licence I ever hated and ever shall hate these spiritual lawyers and their court  And now Jack if I have not secured  victory  I have a  retreat    But holdThy servant with a letter  A confounded long one tho' not a narrative oneOnce more in behalf of the ladyLie thee down oddity What canst thou write that can have force upon me at this crisisAnd have I not as I went along made thee to say all that was necessary for thee to say  Yet once more I'll take thee up  Trite stale poor  say'st thou are some of my contrivances That of the widow's particularlyI have no patience with theeHad not that contrivance its effect at the time for a procrastinationAnd had I not then reason to fear that she would find enough to make her dislike this house And was it not right intending what I intended to lead her on from time o  time with a notion that a house of her own would be ready for her soon in order to induce her to continue here till it was  Trite stale  and  poor  Thou art a silly fellow and no judge when thou sayest this Had I not like a blockhead revealed to thee as I  went along  the secret purposes of my heart but had kept all in till  the event had explained my mysteries I would have defy'd thee to have been able any more than the lady to have guessed at what was to befal her till it had actually come to pass Nor doubt I in this case that instead of presuming to reflect upon her for credulity as  loving me to her misfortune  and for  hoping against probability  thou wouldest have been readier by far to censure her for nicety and overscrupulousness And let me tell thee that had she loved me as I wished her to love me she could not possibly have been so very apprehensive of my designs nor so ready to be influenced by Miss Howe's precautions as she has always been altho' my general character made not for me with her  But in thy opinion I suffer for that simplicity in my contrivances which is their principal excellence No machinery make I necessary No unnatural flights aim I at All pure nature taking advantage of nature as nature tends and so simple my devices that when they are known thou even thou imaginest thou couldest have thought of the same And indeed thou seemest to  own  that the slight thou puttest upon them is owing to my letting thee into them beforehand undistinguishing as well as ingrateful as thou art  Yet after all I would not have thee think that I do not know my weak places I have formerly told thee that it is difficult for the ablest general to say what he  will  do or what he  can  do when he is obliged to regulate his motions by those of a watchful enemy  Vol  III  p    If thou givest due weight to this consideration thou wilt not wonder that I should make many marches and countermarches some of which may appear to a slight observer unnecessary  But let me cursorily enter into this debate with thee on this subject now I am within sight of my journey's end  Abundance of impertinent things thou tellest me in this letter some of which thou hadst from myself others that I knew before  All that thou sayest in this charming creature's praise is short of what I have said and written on this inexhaustible subject  Her virtue her resistance which are her merits are my  stimulatives  Have I not told thee so twenty times over  Devil  as these girls between them call me what of devil am I but in my  contrivances  I am not more a devil than others in the  end  I aim at for when I have carried my point it is still but  one  seduction And I have perhaps been spared the guilt of many seductions in the time  What of uncommon would there be in this case but for her watchfulnessAs well as I love intrigue and stratagem dost think that I had not rather have gained my end with less trouble and less guilt  The man let me tell thee who is as wicked as he  can  be is a worse man than I am Let me ask any Rake in England if resolving to carry his point he would have been so long about it or have had so much compunction as I have had  Were every Rake nay were every Man to sit down as I do and write all that enters into his head or into his heart and to accuse himself with equal freedom and truth what an army of miscreants should I have to keep me in countenance  It is a maxim with some that if they are left alone with a woman and make not an attempt upon her she will think herself affrontedAre not such men as these worse than I amWhat an opinion must they have of the whole Sex  Let me defend the Sex I so dearly loveIf these elder brethren of ours thirsk they have general reason for their assertion they must have kept very bad company or must judge of womens hearts by their  own She must be an abandoned woman who will not shrink as a snail into its shell at a gross and sudden attempt A modest woman must be naturally cold reserved and shy She cannot be so much and so soon affected as libertines are apt to imagine and must at least have some confidence in the honour and silence of a man before desire can possibly put forth in her to encourage and meet his flame For my own part I have been always decent in the company of women till I was sure of them Nor have I ever offered a  great  offence till I have found  little  ones passed over and that they shunn'd me not when they knew my character  My divine Clarissa has puzzled me and beat me out of my play At one time I hoped to overcome by  intimidating  her at another by  Love  by the amorous  Seesaw  as I have called it  Vol  III  p    And I have only now to join  surprize  to the other two and see what can be done by all three  And whose property I pray thee shall I invade if I pursue my schemes of love and vengeanceHave not those who have a right in her renounced that rightHave they not wilfully exposed her to dangersYet must know that such a woman would be considered as lawful prize by as many as could have the opportunity to attempt herAnd had they not thus cruelly exposed her is she not a  single woman  And need I tell thee Jack that men of our cast the  best  of them the  worst  stick at nothing think it a great grace and favour done to the married men if they leave them their wives to themselves and compound for their sisters daughters wards and niecesShocking as these principles must be to a reflecting mind yet such thou knowest are the principles of thousands who would not act by the Sex as I have acted by them when in my power and as often carried into practice as their opportunities  or courage will permitSuch therefore have no right to blame me  Thou repeatedly pleadest her sufferings from her family But I have too often answered this plea to need to say any more now than that she has not suffered for  my sake  For has she not been made the victim of the malice of her rapacious brother and envious sister who only waited for an occasion to ruin her with her other relations and took this as the first to drive her out of the house and as it happen'd into my armsThou knowest how much  against her inclination    As for her  own  sins how many has the dear creature to answer for to  Love  and to  me  Twenty and twenty times twenty has she not told me that she refused not the odious Solmes in favour to me And as often has she not offered to renounce me for the single life if the Implacables would have received her on that conditionWhat repetitions does thy weak pity make me guilty of  To look a little farther back Canst thou forget what my sufferings were from this haughty beauty in the whole time of my attendance upon her proud motions in the purlieus of HarlowePlace and at the little White Hart at Neale as we called itDid I not threaten vengeance upon her then and had I not reason for disappointing me I will give but this one instance of a promised interview  O Jack what a night had I of it in the bleak coppice adjoining to her father's paddockMy linen and wig frozen my limbs absolutely numbed my fingers only sensible of so much warmth as enabled me to hold a pen and that obtained by rubbing the skin off and beating with my hands my shivering sidesKneeling on the hoar moss on one knee writing on the other if the stiff scrawl could be called writingMy feet by the time I had done seeming to have taken root and actually unable to support  me for some minutesLove and Rage kept then my heart in motion and only Love and Rage could do it or how much more than I  did  suffer must I have suffered  I told thee at my melancholy return what were the contents of the letter I wrote  Vol  II  p    And I shewed thee afterwards her tyrannical answer to it  Vol  III  p    Thou then Jack lovedst thy friend and pitiedst thy poor suffering Lovelace Even the affronted God of Love approved then of my threatened vengeance against the fair promiser tho' now with thee in the day of my power forgetful of the night of my sufferings he is become an advocate for her  Nay was it not he himself that brought to me my adorable  Nemesis  and both together put me upon this very vow  'That I would never rest till I had drawn in this goddessdaughter of the Harlowes to cohabit with me and that in the face of all their proud family'  Nor canst thou forget this vowAt this instant I have thee before me as then thou sorrowfully lookedst  Thy strong features glowing with compassion for me thy lips twisted thy forehead furrowed thy whole face drawn out from the stupid round into the ghastly oval every muscle contributing its power to complete the aspect grievous and not one word couldst thou utter but  Amen  to my vow  And what of distinguishing love or favour or confidence have I had from her since to make me forego this vow  I  renewed  it not indeed afterwards and actually for a long season was willing to forget it till repetitions of the same faults revived the remembrance of the formerAnd now adding to those the contents of some of Miss Howe's virulent letters so lately come at what canst thou say for the rebel consistent with thy loyalty to thy friend  Every man to his genius and constitution Hannibal was called  The father of warlike stratagems  Had Hannibal been a private man and turned his plotting head against the  other sex  or had I been a general and turned mine against such of my fellowcreatures of  my own  as I thought myself intitled to consider as my enemies because they were born and l  ved in a different climateHannibal would have done less mischiefLovelace moreThat would have been the difference  Not a sovereign on earth if he be not a  good man  and if he be of a warlike temper but must do a thousand times more mischief than me And why Because he has it in his  power  to do more  An honest man perhaps thou'lt say will not wish to have it in his power to do hurt He  ought not  let me tell him For if he have it a thousand to one but it makes him both wanton and wicked  In what then am I so  singularly  vile  In my  contrivances  thou'lt say for thou art my echo if not in my proposed  end  of them  How difficult does every man find it as well as me to forego a predominant passion I have three passions that sway me by turns all imperial ones Love Revenge Ambition or a desire of conquest  As to this particular contrivance of Tomlinson and the Uncle which thou'lt think a black one perhaps that had been spared had not these  innocent  ladies put me upon finding a husband for their Mrs Townsend That device therefore is but a  preventive  one Thinkest thou that I could bear to be outwitted And may not this very contrivance save a world of mischief for dost thou think I would have tamely given up the lady to Townsend's Tars  What meanest thou except to overthrow thy own plea when thou sayest  that men of our cast know no other bound to their wickedness but want of power  yet knowest this lady to be in mine  Enough  sayest thou  have I tried this paragon of virtue  Not so for I have not tried her at allAll I have been doing is but preparation to a trial  But thou art concerned for the  means  that I may have recourse to in the  trial  and for my  veracity    Silly fellowDid ever any man thinkest thou deceive a girl but at the expence of his veracity How otherwise can he be said to  deceive  As to the  means  thou dost not imagine that I expect a  direct  consentMy main hope is but in a yielding reluctance without which I will be sworn whatever rapes have been attempted none ever were committed one person to one person And good Queen Bess of England had she been living and appealed to would have declared herself of my mind  It would not be amiss for the Sex to know what our opinions are upon this subjectI love to warn themI wish no man to succeed with them but myself I told thee once that  tho' a rake I am not a rake's friend  Vol  III  p      Thou sayest that I ever hated wedlock And true thou sayest And yet  as  true when thou tellest me that I  would rather marry than lose this lady  And  will she detest me for ever  thinkest thou if I try her and succeed notTake careTake care JackSeest thou not that thou warnest me that I do not try without resolving to conquer  I must add that I have for some time been convinced that I have done wrong to scribble to thee so freely as I have done and the more so if I make the Lady legally mine for has not every letter I have written to thee been a bill of indictment against myself I may partly curse my vanity for it and I think I will refrain for the future for thou art really very impertinent  A good man I own might urge many of the things thou urgest but by my soul they come very  aukwardly from thee And thou must be sensible that I can answer every tittle of what thou writest upon the foot of the  maxims we have long held and pursued  By the specimen above thou wilt see that I can  And pr'ythee tell me Jack what but this that follows would have been the epitome of mine and my beloved's story  after ten years cohabitation  had I never written to thee upon the subject and had I not been my own accuser  'Robert Lovelace a notorious womaneater makes his addresses in an honourable way to Miss Clarissa Harlowe a young lady of the highest merit'  Fortunes on both sides out of the question  'After encouragement given he is insulted by her violent brother who thinks it his interest to discountenance the match and who at last challenging him is obliged to take his worthless life at his hands  'The family as much enraged as if he had  taken  the life he  gave  insult him personally and find out an odious lover for the young lady  'To avoid a forced marriage she is prevailed upon 'to throw herself into Mr Lovelace's protection  'Yet disclaiming any passion for him she repeatedly offers to renounce him for ever if on that condition her relations will receive her and free her from the address of the hated lover  'Mr Lovelace a man of strong passions and as some say of great pride thinks himself under very little obligation to her on this account and not being naturally fond of marriage and having so much reason to hate her relations endeavours to prevail upon her to live with him what he calls  the life of honour  And at last by stratagem art and contrivance prevails  'He resolves never to marry any other woman Takes a pride to have her called by his name A Churchrite all the difference between them  Treats her with deserved tenderness Nobody questions their marriage but these proud relations of hers whom he wishes to question it Every year a charming boy Fortunes to support the increasing family with splendorA tender father Always a warm friend a generous landlord and a punctual paymasterNowandthen however perhaps indulging with a new object in order to bring him back with greater delight to his charming ClarissaHis only fault Love of the SexWhich nevertheless the women say will cure itselfDefensible thus far that he breaks no contracts by his roveings  And what is there so very greatly amiss as the world goes in all this  Let me aver that there are thousands and ten thousands who have worse stories to tell than this would appear to be had I not interested thee in the progress to my great end And besides thou knowest that the character I gave myself to Joseph Leman as to my treatment of my mistresses is pretty near the truth  Vol  III  p      Were I to be as much in earnest in my defence as thou art warm in my arraignment I could convince thee by other arguments observations and comparisons  Is not all human good and evil comparative  that tho' from my ingenuous temper writing only to thee who art master of every secret of my heart I am so ready to accuse myself in my narrations yet I have something to say  for  myself  to  myself as I go along tho' no one else perhaps that was not a rake would allow any weight to itAnd this caution might I give to thousands who would stoop for a stone to throw at me  'See that your own  predominant passions  whatever they be hurry you not into as much wickedness as  mine  do  me  See if ye happen to be better than me in  some things that ye are not worse in others and in points too that may be of more extensive bad consequence than that of seducing a girl and taking care of her afterwards who from her cradle is armed with cautions against the delusions of men'  And yet I am not so partial to my own faults as to think lightly of  that  when I allow myself to think  Another grave thing will I add now my hand's in  'So dearly do I love the sex that had I found that a character for virtue had been generally necessary to recommend me to them I should have had a much greater regard to my morals as to the sex than I have had'  To sum up allI am sufficiently apprized that men of worthy and honest hearts who never allowed themselves in  premeditated  evil and who take into the account the excellencies of this fine creature will and must not only condemn but  abhor  me were they to know as much of me as thou dostBut methinks I would be glad to escape the censure of those men and of those women too who have never known what capital trials and temptations are who have no genius for enterprize and most particularly of those who have only kept their secret better than I have kept or wished to keep mine  I THREATENED above to refrain writing to thee But take it not to heart JackI must write on and cannot help it  LETTER XLIX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wednesday Night

execution my plot So near springing my mine All agreed upon between the women and me or I believe thou hadst overthrown me  I have time for a few lines preparative to what is to happen in an hour or two and I love to write to the moment  We have been extremely happy How many agreeable days have we known together What may the next two hours produce  When I parted with my charmer which I did with infinite reluctance half an hour ago it was upon her promise that she would not sit up to write or read For so engaging was the conversation to me and indeed my behaviour throughout the whole of it was confessedly agreeable to her that I insisted if she did not directly retire to rest that she should add another happy hour to the former  To have sat up writing or reading half the night as she sometimes does would have frustrated my view as thou wilt observe when my little plot unravels  WHATWhatWhat nowbounding villain wouldst thou choak me  I was speaking to my heart JackIt was then at my throatAnd what is all this forThese shy ladies how when a man thinks himself near the mark do they tempest him  Is all ready Dorcas Has my beloved kept her word with meWhether are these billowy

uproar abatesWhat a  double coward  am IOr is it that I am taken in a cowardly minute for heroes have their fits of  fear  cowards their  brave  moments And virtuous ladies all but my Clarissa their

LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Thursday morning Five o'clock June    NOW is my reformation secur'd for I never shall love any other womanO she is all variety She must be ever new to me  Imagination  cannot  form much less can the pencil paint nor can the soul of painting  poetry  describe an angel so exquisitely so elegantly lovelyBut I will not by anticipation pacify thy impatience Altho' the subject is too hallowed for profane contemplation yet shalt thou have the whole before thee as it passed And this not from a spirit wantoning in description upon so rich a subject but with a design to put a bound to thy roving thoughtsIt will be iniquity greater than a Lovelace ever was guilty of to carry them farther than I shall acknowlege  Thus then connecting my last with the present I lead to it  Didst thou not by the conclusion of my former perceive the consternation I was in just as I was about to reperuse thy letter in order to prevail upon myself to recede from my purpose of awaking in terrors my slumbering charmer And what dost thou think was the matter  I'll tell thee  At a little after two when the whole house was still or seem'd to be so and as it proved my Clarissa abed and fast asleep I also in a manner undressed for an hour before and in my gown and slippers tho' to oblige thee writing onI was alarm'd by a trampling noise over head and a confused buz of mix'd voices some louder than others like scolding and little short of screaming all raised to vocatives as in a fright And while I was wondering what could be the matter down stairs ran Dorcas and at my door in an accent rather frightedly and hoarsly inward than shrilly clamorous cried out Fire Fire And this the more alarmed me as she seem'd to endeavour to cry out louder but could not  My pen its last scrawl a benediction on my beloved dropt from my fingers and up started I and making but three steps to the door open'd it and cry'd Where Where almost as much terrify'd as  the wench While she more than halfundrest her perticoats in her hand unable to speak distinctly pointed up stairs  I was there in a moment and found all owing to the carelessness of Mrs Sinclair's cookmaid who having sat up to read the simple history of Dorastus and Fau  ia when she should have been in bed had set fire to an old pair of callicoe windowcurtains  She had had the presence of mind in her fright to tear down the halfburnt vallens as well as curtains and had got them tho' blazing into the chimney by the time I came up so that I had the satisfaction to find the danger happily over  Mean time Dorcas after she had directed me up stairs not knowing the worst was over and expecting every minute the house would be in a blaze out of tender regard for her lady I shall for ever love the wench for it ran to her door and rapping loudly at it in a recovered voice cry'd out with a shrilness equal to her love Fire FireThe house is on fireRise MadamThis instant riseif you would not be burnt in your bed  No sooner had she made this dreadful outcry but I heard her lady's door with hasty violence unbar unbolt unlock and open and my charmer's voice sounding like that of one going into a fit  You may believe how much I was affected I trembled with concern for her and hastened down faster than the alarm of fire had made me run up in order to satisfy her that all the danger was over  When I had  flown down  to her chamberdoor there I beheld the charmingest creature in the world supporting herself on the arm of the gasping Dorcas sighing trembling and ready to faint with nothing on but an underpetticoat her lovely bosom halfopen and her feet just slipt into her shoes As soon as she saw me she panted and struggled to speak  but could only say Oh Mr Lovelace and down was ready to sink  I clasped her in my arms with an ardor she never felt before My dearest life fear nothing I have been upThe danger is overThe fire is got underAnd how foolish devil to Dorcas could you thus by your hideous yell alarm and frighten my angel  Oh Jack how her sweet bosom as I clasp'd her to mine heav'd and panted I could even distinguish her dear heart flutter flutter flutter against mine and for a few minutes I fear'd she would go into fits  Lest the halflifeless charmer should catch cold in this undress I lifted her to her bed and sat down by her upon the side of it endeavouring with the utmost tenderness as well of action as expression to dissipate her terrors  But what did I get by this my generous care of her and by my  successful  endeavour to bring her to herselfNothing ungrateful as she was but the most passionate exclamations For we had both already forgot the occasion dreadful as it was which had thrown her into my arms I from the joy of incircling the almost disrobed body of the loveliest of her sex she from the greater terrors that arose from finding herself in my arms and both seated on the bed from which she had been so lately frighted  And now Belford reflect upon the distance the watchful charmer had hitherto kept me at Reflect upon my love and upon my sufferings for her Reflect upon her vigilance and how long I had lain in wait to elude it the awe I had stood in because of her frozen virtue and overniceness and that I never before was so happy with her and then think how  ngovernable must be my transports in those happy momentsAnd yet in my own account I was both decent and generous The following lines alter'd to the fi  st person come nearest of any I can recollect to the rapturous occasion  Bowing I kneel'd and her forc'd hand I press'd  With sweet compulsion to my beating breast  O'er it in ecstasy my lips bent low  And tides of sighs 'twixt her grasp'd fingers flow  High beat my hurry'd pulse at each fierce kiss  And ev'ry burning sinew ak'd with bliss  But far from being affected by an address so fervent although from a man she had so lately owned a regard for and with whom but an hour or two before she had parted with so much satisfaction that  never saw a bitterer or more moving grief when she came fully to herself  She appealed to Heaven against my  treachery  as she called it while I by the most solemn vows pleaded my own equal fright and the reality of the danger that had alarmed us both  She conjur'd me in the most solemn and affecting manner by turns threatening and soothing to quit her apartment and permit her to hide herself from the light and from every human eye  I besought her pardon yet could not avoid offending and repeatedly vow'd that the next morning's sun should witness our espousals But taking I suppose all my protestations of this kind as an indication that I intended to proceed to the last extremity she would hear nothing that I said but redoubling her struggles to get from me in broken accents and exclamations the most vehement she protested that she would not survive what she called a treatment so disgraceful and villainous and looking all wildly round her as if for some instrument of mischief she espied a pair of sharppointed scissars on a chair by the bedside and endeavoured to catch them up with design to make her words good on the spot  Seeing her desperation I begged her to be pacify'd that she would hear me speak but one word declaring that I intended no dishonour to her And having seized  the scissars I threw them into the chimney and she still insisting vehemently upon my distance I permitted her to take the chair  But O the sweet discomposureHer bared shoulders and arms so inimitably fair and lovely Her spread hands crossed over her charming neck yet not half concealing its glossy beauties The scanty coat as she rose from me giving the whole of her admirable shape and fineturn'd limbs Her eyes runningover yet seeming to threaten future vengeance And at last her lips uttering what every indignant look and glowing feature portended exclaiming as if I had done the worst I could do and vowing never to forgive me wilt thou wonder that I could avoid resuming the incensed the already toomuchprovoked fair one  I did and clasped her once more to my bosom But considering the delicacy of her frame her force was amazing and shewed how much in earnest she was in her resentment for it was with the utmost difficulty that I was able to hold her Nor could I prevent her sliding through my arms to fall upon her knees Which she did at my feet And there in the anguish of her soul her streaming eyes lifted up to my face with supplicating softness hands folded dishevelled hair for her night headdress having fallen off in her struggling her charming tresses fell down in naturally shining ringlets as if officious to conceal the dazling beauties of her neck and shoulders her lovely bosom too heaving with sighs and broken sobs as if to aid her quivering lips in pleading for herIn this manner but when her grief gave way to her speech in words pronounced with that emphatical propriety which distinguishes this admirable creature in her elocution from all the women I ever heard speak did she implore my compassion and my honour  'Consider me  dear  Lovelace' were her charming  words 'on my knees I beg you to consider me as a poor creature who has no protector but you who has no defence but your honour By that Honour By your Humanity By all you have vow'd I conjure you not to make me abhor myself Not to make me vile in my own eyes'  I mentioned the morrow as the happiest day of my life  Tell me not of tomorrow if indeed you mean me honourably  Now  This very instant NOW you must shew it and begone You can never in a whole long life repair the evils you may NOW make me suffer  Wicked wretchInsolent villainYes she called me insolent villain altho' so much in my power And for whatonly for kissing with passion indeed her inimitable neck her lips her cheeks her forehead and her streaming eyes as this assemblage of beauties offered itself at once to my ravished sight she continuing kneeling at my feet as I sat  If I  am  a villain MadamAnd then my grasping but trembling handI hope I did not hurt the tenderest and loveliest of all her beautiesIf I am a villain Madam  She tore my ruffle shrunk from my happy hand with amazing force and agility as with my other arm I would have incircled her waist  Indeed you areThe worst of villainsHelp dear blessed people and scream'dNo help for a poor creature  Am  I then a villain Madam  Am  I then a villain say youand clasped both my arms about her offering to raise her to my bounding heart  O noAnd yet you areAnd again I was her  dear  LovelaceHer hands again clasped over her charming bosomKill me Kill meIf I am odious enough in your eyes to deserve this treatment and I will thank youToo long much  too long has my life been a burden to meO  wildly looking all around her give me but the means and I will instantly convince you that my honour is dearer to me than my life  Then with still folded hands and freshstreaming eyes I was her  blessed  Lovelace and she would thank me with her latest breath if I would permit her to make that preference or free her from farther indignities  I sat suspended for a moment By my soul thought I thou art upon full proof an angel and no woman Still however close clasping her to my bosom as I had raised her from her knees she again slid through my arms and dropt upon them  'See Mr LovelaceGood God that I should live to see this hour and to bear this treatmentSee at your feet a poor creature imploring your pity who for your sake is abandon'd of all the world Let not my father's curse thus dreadfully operate Be not  you  the inflicter who have been the  cause  of it But spare me I beseech you spare meFor how have I deserved this treatment from youFor your own sake if not for my sake and as you would that God Almighty in your last hour should have mercy upon you spare me'    What heart but must have been penetrated  I would again have raised the dear suppliant from her knees but she would not be raised till my softened mind she said had yielded to her prayer and bid her rise to be innocent  Rise then my angel rise and be what you are and all you wish to be Only pronounce me pardon'd for what has passed and tell me you will continue to look upon me with that eye of favour and serenity which I have been blessed with for some days past and I will submit to my beloved conquer  ss whose power never was at so great an height with me as now and retire to my apartment  God Almighty said she hear your prayers in your most arduous moments as you have heard mine And now leave me this moment leave me to my own recollection In  that  you will leave me to misery enough and more than you ought to wish to your bitterest enemy  Impute not every thing my best Beloved to design for design it was not  O Mr Lovelace  Upon my soul Madam the fire was realAnd so it was JackThe house might have been consumed by it as you will be convinced in the morning by ocular demonstration  O Mr Lovelace  Let my passion for you Madam and the unexpected meeting of you at your chamberdoor in an attitude so charming  Leave me leave me this momentI beseech you leave me looking wildly and in confusion now about her and now upon herself  Excuse me dearest creature for those liberties which innocent as they were your too great delicacy may make you take amiss  No more No moreLeave me I beseech you Again looking upon herself and around her in a sweet confusionBegone BegoneThen weeping she struggled vehemently to withdraw her hands which all the while I held between mineHer struggles O what additional charms as I now reflect did her struggles give to every feature every limb of a person so sweetly elegant and lovely  Impossible my dearest life till you pronounce my pardonSay but you forgive meSay you do  I beseech you begone Leave me to myself that I may think what I  can  do and what I  ought  to do  That my dearest creature is not enough You must tell me that I am forgiven that you will see me tomorrow as if nothing had happened  And then clasping her again in my arms hoping she would not forgive me  I willI do forgive youWretch that you are  Nay my Clarissa And is it such a reluctant pardon mingled with a word so upbraiding that I am to be put off with when you are thus clasping her close to me in my power  I do I  do  forgive you  Heartily  Yes heartily  And freely  Freely  And will you look upon me tomorrow as if nothing had passed  Yes yes  I cannot take these peevish affirmatives so much like intentional negativesSay you will upon your honour  Upon my honour thenO now begone begone and never  What never my angelIs this forgiveness  Never said she let what has passed be remembered more  I insisted upon one kiss to seal my pardonAnd retired like a fool a woman's fool as I wasI sneakingly retiredCouldst thou have believed it  But I had no sooner enter'd my own apartment than reflecting upon the opportunity I had lost and that all I had gained was but an increase of my own difficulties and upon the ridicule I should meet with below upon a weakness so much out of my usual character I repented and hasten'd back in hope that through the distress of mind which I left her in she had not so soon fastened her door and I was sully resolved to execute all my purposes be the consequence what it would for thought I I have already sinned beyond  cordial  forgiveness I doubt and if fits  and desperation ensue I can but marry at last and then I shall make her amends  But I was justly punish'dfor her door was fast And hearing her sigh and sob as if her heart would burst My beloved creature said I rapping gently and her sobbings ceasing I want but to say three words to you which must be the most acceptable you ever heard from me Let me see you but for one moment  I thought I heard her coming to open the door and my heart leapt in that hope but it was only to draw another bolt to make it still the faster and she either could not or would not answer me but retired to the further end of her apartment to her closet probably And more like a fool than before again I sneaked away  This was my mine my plotAnd this was all I made of it  I love her more than everAnd well I mayNever saw I such polished ivory as her arms and shoulders seemed to be never touched I velvet so soft as her skin Then such an elegance O Belford she is all perfection Her pretty foot in her struggling losing her shoe but just slipped on as I told thee equally white and delicate as the hand of any other lady or even as her own hand  But seest thou not that I have a claim of merit for a grace that everybody hitherto had denied me And that is for a capacity of being moved by prayers and tears Where where on this occasion was the  callus  where the flint that my heart was said to be surrounded by  This indeed is the first instance in the like case that ever I was wrought upon But why Because I never before encountered a resistance so much in ear nest A resistance in short so irresistible  What a triumph has her sex obtained in my thoughts by this trial and this resistance  But if she can  now  forgive me  Can  She  must  ▪  Has she not upon her honour already done itBut how will the dear creature keep that part of her promise which engages her to see me in the morning as if nothing had happened  She would give the world I fancy to have the first interview overShe had not best reproach meYet  not  to reproach meWhat a charming puzzle Let her break her word with me at her peril Fly me she cannot No appeals lie from my tribunalWhat friend has she in the world if my compassion exert not itself in her favourAnd then the worthy Captain Tomlinson and her Uncle Harlowe will be able to make all up for me be my next offence what it will  As to thy apprehensions of her committing any rashness upon herself whatever she might have done in her passion if she could have seized upon her scissars or found any other weapon I dare say there is no fear of that from her  deliberate  mind A man has trouble enough with these truly pious and truly virtuous girls Now I believe there are such he had need to have some benefit  from  some security  in  the rectitude of their minds  In short I fear nothing in this lady but grief yet that's a slow worker you know and gives time to pop in a little joy between its sullen fits  LETTER LI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Thursday morning Eight o'clock  HER chamberdoor has not yet been opened I must not expect she will breakfast with me Nor dine with me I doubt A little silly soul what troubles does she make to herself by her overnicenessAll I have done to her would have been looked upon as a frolick only a rompingbout and laughed  off by nine parts in ten of the sex accordingly The more she makes of it the more painful to herself as well as to me  Why now Jack were it not better upon  her own  notions that she seemed not so sensible as she will make herself to be if she is very angry  But perhaps I am more afraid than I need I believe I am From her  over  niceness arises my fear more than from any extraordinary reason for resentment Next time she may count herself very happy if she come off no worse  The dear creature was so frighten'd and so fatigued last night no wonder she lies it out this morning  I hope she has had more rest than I have had Soft and balmy I hope have been her slumbers that she may meet me in tolerable temper All sweetly blushing and confoundedI  know  how she will lookBut why should she the  sufferer  be ashamed when I the  trespasser  am not  But custom is a prodigious thing The ladies are told how much their blushes heighten their graces They practise for them therefore Blushes come as readily when they call them as their tears Ay that's it While we men taking blushes for a sign of guilt or sheepishness are equally studious to suppress them  BY my troth Jack I am half as much ashamed to see the women below as my fair one can be to see me I have not yet open'd my door that I may not be obtruded upon by them  After all what devils may one make of the Sex To what a height ofWhat shall I call itmust those of it be arrived who once loved a man with so much distinction as both Polly and S  lly loved me and yet can have got so much above the pangs of jealousy so much above the mortifying reflections that arise from dividing and sharing with new objects the affections  of him they prefer to all others as to wish for an  promote a competitorship in his love and make their supreme delight consist in reducing others to their levelFor thou canst not imagine how even Sally Martin rejoiced last night in the thought that the lady's hour was approaching  Past Ten o'clock  I NEVER long'd in my life for any thing with so much impatience as to see my charmer She has been stirring it seems these two hours  Dorcas just now tapp'd at her door to take her morning commands  She had none for her  was the answer  She desired to know If she would not breakfast  A sullen and lowvoiced  negative  she received  I will go myself  THREE different times tapp'd I at the door but had no answer  Permit me dearest creature to inquire after your health As you have not been seen today I am impatient to know how you do  Not a word of answer but a deep sigh even to sobbing  Let me beg of you Madam to accompany me up another pair of stairsYou'll rejoice to see what a happy escape we have all had  A happy escape indeed JackFor the fire had scorched the windowboard findged the hangings and burnt through the slitdeal lining of the windowjambs  No answer MadamAm I not worthy of one wordIs it thus you keep your promise with meShall I not have the favour of your company for two minutes only for two minutes in the diningroom  HemAnd a deep sighwas all the answer  Answer me but how you do Answer me but that you are wellIs this the forgiveness that was the condition of my obedience  Then in a faintish but angry voice Begone from my doorWretch inhuman barbarous and all that's base and treacherousBegone from my door Nor teaze thus a poor creature intitled to protection not outrage  Well Madam I see how you keep your word with me  If  a sudden impulse the effects of an unthoughtof accident cannot be forgiven  O the dreadful weight of a father's curse thus in the letter of it so likely to be fulfilled  And then her voice dying away into inarticulate murmurs I looked through the keyhole and saw her on her knees her face tho' not towards me lifted up as well as hands and these folded deprecating I  uppose that gloomy tyrant's curse  I could not help being moved  My dearest life admit me to your presence but for two minutes and confirm your promised pardon and may lightning blast me on the spot if I offer any thing but my penitence at a shrine so sacredI will afterwards leave you for the whole day and till tomorrow morning then to attend with writings all ready to sign a licence obtained or if it cannot a minister without one This once believe me When you see the reality of the danger that gave occasion for this your unhappy resentment you will think less hardly of me And let me beseech you to perform a promise on which I made a reliance not altogether ungenerous  I cannot see you Would to heaven I never had If I write that's all I can do  Let your writing then my dearest life confirm your promise And I will withdraw in expectation of it  Past Eleven o'clock  JUST now she rung her bell for Dorcas and with her door in her hand only halfopen'd gave her a billet for me  How did the dear creature look Dorcas  She was dressed Turned her face quite from me Sigh'd as if her heart would break  Sweet creatureI kissed the wet wafer and drew it from the paper with my breath  These are the contentsNo inscriptive Sir No Mr Lovelace  I Cannot see you Nor will I if I can help it Words cannot express the anguish of my soul on your baseness and ingratitude  If the circumstances of things are such that I can have no way for reconciliation with those who would have been my natural protectors from such outrages but through  you  the only inducement I can have to stay a moment longer in your knowlege pen and ink must be at present the only means of communication between us  Vilest of men and most detestable of plotters how have I deserved from you the shocking indignitiesBut no moreOnly for your own sake wish not at least for a week to come to see  The undeservedly injured and insulted  CLARISSA HARLOWE  So thou seest nothing could have stood me in stead but this plot of Tomlinson and her Uncle To what a pretty pass nevertheless have I brought myselfHad Caesar been such a fool he had never passed the Rubicon But after he  had  passed it had he retreated  re infectâ  intimidated by a senatorial edict what a pretty figure would he have made in historyI might have known that to attempt a robbery and put a person in bodily fear is as punishable as if the robbery had been actually committed  But not to see her for a week  Dear pretty soul how she anticipates me in every thing The counsellor will have finished the writings ready to sign today or tomorrow at furthest The licence with the parson or the parson without the licence must be also procured within the next fourandtwenty hours Pritchard is as good as ready with his indentures tripartite Tomlinson is at hand with a favourable answer from her Uncle  Yet not to see her for a week  Dear sweet soulHer good angel is gone a journey Is truanting at least But nevertheless in thy week's time and much less my charmer I doubt not to have completed my triumph  But what vexes me of all things is that such an excellent creature should break her wordFie fie upon herBut nobody is absolutely perfect  'Tis human to err  but  not to persevere  I hope my charmer cannot be inhuman  LETTER LII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  King'sArms Pallmall  Thursday Two o'clock  SEveral billets passed between us before I went out by the internuncioship of Dorcas For which reason mine are superscribed by her married nameShe would not open her door to receive them lest I should be near it I suppose So Dorcas was forced to put them under the door after copying them for thee and thence to take the answer Read them if thou wilt at this place  To Mrs  LOVELACE    INdeed my dearest life you carry this matter too far What will the people below who suppose us one as to the ceremony think of so great a niceness Liberties so innocent the occasion so accidentalYou will expose  yourself  as well as  me  Hitherto they know nothing of what has passed And  what indeed  has  passed to occasion all this resentmentI am sure you will not by a breach of your word of honour give me reason to conclude that had I  not  obeyed you I could have fared no worse  Most sincerely do I repent the offence given to your delicacyBut must I for so accidental an occurrence be branded by such shocking names  Vilest of men  and  most detestable of plotters  are hard wordsFrom such a Lady's pen too  If you step up another pair of stairs you'll be convinced that however  detestable  to you I am no  plotter  in this affair  I must insist upon seeing you in order to take your directions upon some of the subjects that we talked of yesterday in the evening  All that's more than necessary is too much I claim your promised pardon and wish to plead it on my knees  I beg your presence in the diningroom for one quarter of an hour and I will then leave you for the day I am my dearest life  Your everadoring and truly penitent  LOVELACE  To Mr  LOVELACE    I Will not see you I cannot see you I have no directions to give you Let Providence decide for me as it pleases  The more I reflect upon your vileness your ingraful your barbarous vileness the more I am exasperated against you  You are the  last  person whose judgment I would take upon what is or is not carried too far in matters of decency  'Tis grievous to me to write or even to think of you at present Urge me no more then Once more I will  not  see you Nor care I now you have made me vile to myself what other people think of me  To Mrs  LOVELACE    AGain Madam I remind you of your promise And beg leave to say I insist upon the performance of it  Remember dearest creature that the fault of a blameable person cannot warrant a fault in one more perfect Over niceness may be underniceness  I cannot reproach myself with any thing that deserves this high resentment  I own that the violence of my passion for you might have carried me beyond fit boundsBut that your commands and adjurations had such a power over me at such a moment I humbly presume to say deserves some consideration  You injoin me not to see you for a week If I have not your pardon before Captain Tomlinson comes to town what shall I say to  him  I beg once more your presence in the diningroom By my soul Madam I  must  see you  I want to consult you about the licence and other particulars of great importance The people below think us married and I cannot talk to you the door between us upon such subjects  For heaven's sake favour me with your presence for a few minutes And I will leave you for the day  If I am to be forgiven according to your promise the earliest forgiveness must be the least painful to yourself as well as to  Your truly contrite and afflicted  LOVELACE  To Mr  LOVELACE    THE more you teaze me the worse will it be for you  Time  is wanted to consider whether I ever should think of you at all At present it is my sincere wish that I may never more see your face  All that can afford you the least shadow of favour from me arises from the hopedfor reconciliation with my  real  not my  Judas  protector  I am careless at present of consequences I hate myself And who is it I have reason to valueNot the man who could form a plot to disgrace his own hopes as well as a poor friendless creature made friendless by himself by outrages not to be thought of with patience  To Mrs  LOVELACE    Madam  I Will go to the Commons and proceed in every particular as if I had not the misfortune to be under your displeasure  I must insist upon it that however faulty my passion on so unexpected an incident made me appear to a lady of your delicacy yet my compliance with your intreaties at such a moment as it gave you an instance of your power over me which few men could have shewn ought duly consider'd to intitle me to the effects of that solemn promise which was the condition of my obedience  I hope to find you in a kinder and I will say  juster  disposition on my return Whether I get the licence or not let me beg of you to make the  Soon  you have been pleased to bid me hope for tomorrow morning This will reconcile every thing and make me the happiest of men  The settlements are ready to sign or will be by night  For heaven's sake Madam do not carry your resentment into a displeasure so disproportionate to the offence For that would be to expose us both to the people below and what is of infinite more consequence to us to Captain Tomlinson Let us be able I beseech you Madam to assure him on his next visit that we are one  As I have no hope to be permitted to dine with you I shall not return till evening And then I presume to say I  expect  your  promise  authorizes me to use the word to find you disposed to bless by your consent for tomorrow  Your adoring  LOVELACE  WHAT pleasure did I propose to take how to  enjoy  the sweet confusion I expected to find her in while all was so recentBut she  must  she  shall  see me on my return It were better for  herself  as well as for  me  that she had not made  so much ado about nothing  I must keep my anger alive lest it sink into compassion  Love  and  Compassion  be the provocation ever so great are hard to be separated While  Anger  converts what would be  Pity  without it into  Resentment  Nothing can be lovely in a man's eye with which he is thoroughly displeased  I ordered Dorcas on putting the last billet under the door and finding it taken up to tell her that I hoped an answer to it before I went out  Her reply was verbal  Tell him that I care not whither he goes nor what he doesAnd this  reurged by Dorcas  was all she had to say to me    I looked thro' her keyhole at my going by her door and saw her on her knees at her bed's feet her head and bosom on the bed her arms extended sweet creature and in an agony she seemed to be sobbing as I heard at that distance as if her heart would breakBy my soul Jack I am a  pity  ful fellow Recollection is my enemyDivine excellenceHappy for so many days togetherNow so unhappyAnd for whatBut she is purity itselfAnd why after all should I thus tormentBut I must not trust myself with myself in the humour I am in  WAITING here for Mowbray and Mallory by whose aid I am to get the licence I took papers out o  my pocket to divert myself and thy last popt itself officiously the first into my hand I gave it the honour of a reperusal and this revived the subject with me which I had resolved not to trust myself with  I remember that the dear creature in her torn answer to my proposals says  That condescension is not meanness  She better knows how to make this out than any mortal breathing Condescension indeed  implies  dignity And dignity ever  was  there in  her  condescension Yet such a dignity as gave grace to the condescension for there was no pride no insult no apparent superiority indicated by itThis Miss Howe confirms to be a part of her general character  Page    of this Volume    I can tell her how she might behave to make me her own for ever She knows she cannot fly me She knows she must see me sooner or later the sooner the more graciousI would allow her to resent not because the liberties I took with her require resentment were she not a CLARISSA but as it becomes her particular niceness to resent But would she shew more  Love  than  Abhorrence  of me in her resentment would she  seem  if it were  but  to  seem  to believe the fire no device and all that followed merely accidental and descend upon it to tender expostulation and upbraiding for the advantage I would have taken of her surprize and would she at last be satisfied as  well  she may that it was attended with no further consequence and place some generous confidence in my honour Power loves to be trusted Jack I think I would put an end to all her trials and pay her my vows at the altar  Yet to have taken such bold steps as with Tomlinson and her UncleTo have made such a progressO Belford Belford how have I puzzled myself as  well as herThis cursed aversion to wedlock how has it intangled meWhat contradictions has it not made me guilty of  How pleasing to myself to look back upon the happy days I gave her though mine would doubtless have been more unmixedly so could I have determined to lay aside my contrivances and to be as sincere all the time as she deserved that I should be  I  find this humour hold but till tomorrow mor  ing And it has now lasted two full hours and I s  nks to have  pleasure  in encouraging it  th make thee a visit I think or get thee to come to me and then will I consult thee upon it  But she will not trust me She will not confide in my honour Doubt in this case is defiance She loves me not well enough to forgive me generously She is so greatly above me How can I forgive her for a merit so mortifying to my pride She  thinks  she  knows  she has  told  me that she is above me These words are still in my ears  'Begone LovelaceMy soul is above thee manThou hast a proud heart to contend withMy soul is above thee man  See page    of this Volume  '  Miss Howe thinks her above me too Thou even thou my friend my  intimate  friend and companion art of the same opinion I fear her as much as I love herHow shall my pride bear these reflectionsMy wife as I have so often said because it so often recurs to my thoughts to be so  much  my superiorMyself to be considered but as the second person in my own familyCanst thou teach me to bear such a reflection as thisTo tell me of my acquisition in her and that she with all her excellencies will be  mine  in full property is a mistakeIt cannot be soFor shall I not be  hers  and not  my own  Will not every act of her duty as I cannot deserve it be a condescension and a triumph over meAnd must I owe it merely to her  goodness  that she does not despise  meTo have her condescend to bear with my folliesTo wound me with an eye of pityA daughter of the Harlowes thus to excel the last and as I have heretofore said not the meanest of the LovelacesForbid it  Yet forbid it notFor do I not nowdo I not every momentsee her before me all over charms and elegance and purity as in the struggles of the past midnight And in these struggles heart voice eyes hands and sentiments so greatly so gloriously consistent with the character she has sustained from her cradle to the present hour  But what advantages do I give thee  Yet have I not always done her justice Why then thy teazing impertinence  However I forgive thee JackSince so much generous love am I capable of I had rather all the world should condemn  me  than that  her  character should suffer the least impeachment  The dear creature herself once told me that there was a strange mixture in my mind  Vol  III  p      I have been called  Devil  and  Beelzebub  between the two proud beauties I must indeed be a Beelzebub if I had not some tolerable qualities  But as Miss Howe says her  sufferingtime  is her  shiningtime  Vol  IV  p    Hitherto she has done nothing but shine  She called me  villain  Belford within these few hours And what is the sum of the present argument but that had I  not  been a villain in her sense of the word she had not been so much an  angel  O Jack Jack This midnight attempt has made me mad has utterly undone me How can the dear creature say I have made her vile in her  own  eyes when her behaviour under such a surprize and her resentment under such circumstances have so greatly exalted her in  mine  Whence however this strange rhapsodyIs it owing to my being  here  That I am not at  Sinclair  's But if there be infection in that house how has my Beloved escaped it  But no more in this strainI will see what her behaviour will be on my returnYet already do I begin to apprehend some little sinkings some little retrogradations for I have just now a doubt arisen whether for  her own  sake I should wish her to forgive me  lightly  or with  difficulty  I AM in away to come at the wish'dfor licence  I have now given everything between my Beloved and me a full consideration and my puzzle is over What has brought me to a speedier determination is that I think I have found out what she means by the  week  's distance she intends to hold me at It is that she may have time to write to Miss Howe to put in motion that cursed scheme of hers and to take measures upon it which shall enable her to abandon and renounce me for everNow Jack if I obtain not admission to her presence on my return but am refused with haughtiness if her  week  be insisted upon such prospects before her I shall be confirmed in my conjecture and it will be plain to me that weak at best was that Love which could give place to punctilio at a time that the allreconciling ceremony so she must think waits her commandThen will I recollect all her perversenesses then will I reperuse Miss Howe's letters and the transcripts from others of them and give way to my aversion to the life of shackles And then shall she be mine in my own way  But after all I am in hopes that she will have better considered of everything by the evening That her threat of a  week  's distance was thrown out in the heat of passion and that she will allow that I have as much cause to quarrel with her for breach of her word as she has with me for breach of the peace  These lines of Rowe have got into my head and I shall repeat them very devoutly all the way the chairmen shall poppet me towards her byandby  Teach me some power the happy art of speech  To dress my purpose up in gracious words  Such as may softly steal upon her soul  And never waken the tempestuous passions  LETTER LIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Thursday Evening June    O For a curse to kill withRuin'd Undone Outwitted trick'dZounds man the lady is gone offAbsolutely gone offEscaped  Thou knowest not nor canst conceive the pangs that wring my heartWhat can I doO Lord O Lord O Lord  And thou too who hast endeavoured to weaken my hands wilt but clap thy dragon's wings at the tidings  Yet I must write or I shall go distracted Little less have I been these two hours dispatching messengers to every stage to every inn to every waggon or coach whether flying or creeping and to every house with a bill up for five miles round  The little hypocrite who knows not a soul in this town  I thought I was sure of her at any time  such an unexperienced traitress giving me hope too in her first billet that her expectation of the familyreconciliation would withhold her from taking such a step as thisCurse upon her contrivancesI thought that it was owing to her bashfulness to her modesty that after a few innocent freedoms she could not look me in the face when all the while she was impudently yes I say  impudently  though she be Clarissa Harlowe contriving to rob me of the dearest  property I had ever purchasedPurchased by a painful servitude of many months fighting through the wild beasts of her family for her and combating with a windmill virtue that hath cost me millions of perjuries only to attempt and which now with its damn'd airfans has tost me a mile and a half beyond hopeAnd this just as I had arrived within view of the consummation of all my wishes  O Devil of Love God of Love no moreHow have I deserved this of theeNever before the friend of frozen virtue  Powerless  daemon for powerless thou must be if thou meanedst not to play me booty who shall henceforth kneel at thy altarsMay every enterprizing heart abhor despise execrate renounce thee as I doBut what signifies cursing now  How she could effect this her wicked escape is my astonishment the whole sisterhood having charge of herFor as yet I have not had patience enough to inquire into the particulars nor to let a soul of them approach me  Of this I am sure  or I had not brought her hither  There is not a creature belonging to this house that could be corrupted either by virtue or remorse The highest joy every infernal nymph of this worse than infernal habitation  could  have known would have been to reduce this proud Beauty to her own levelAnd as to my villain who also had charge of her he is such a season'd varlet that he delights in mischief for the sake of it No bribe could seduce him to betray his trust were there but wickedness in it'Tis well however he was out of my way when the cursed news was imparted to meGone the villain in quest of her Not to return nor to see my  ace so it seems he declared till he has heard some tidings of her and all the outofplace varlets of his numerous acquaintance are summoned and employed in the same business  To what purpose brought I this angel angel I must yet call her to this hellish houseAnd was I not meditating to do her deserved honour By my soul Belford I was resolvedBut thou knowest what I had  conditionally  resolvedAnd now tho' I was determined so much in her favour who can tell what hands she may have fallen into  I am mad stark mad by Jupiter at the thoughts of thisUnprovided destitute unacquaintedsome villain worse than myself who adores her not as I adore her may have seized her and taken advantage of her distressLet me perish Belford if a whole hecatomb of  innocents  as the little plagues are called shall atone for the broken promise and wicked artifices of this cruel creature  COMING home with resolutions so favourable to her judge thou of my distraction when her escape was first hinted to me although but in broken sentences I knew not what I said nor what I did I wanted to kill somebody I flew out of one room into another while all avoided me but the veteran Betty Carberry who broke the matter to me I charged bribery and corruption in my first fury upon all and threatened destruction to old and young as they should come in my way  Dorcas continues  locked  up from me Sally and Polly have not yet dared to appear The vile Sinclair  But here comes the odious devil She taps at the door though that's only ajar whining and snuffling to try I suppose to coax me into temper  WHAT a helpless state where a man can only execrate himself and others the occasion of his rage remaining the evil increasing upon reflection time itself conspiring to deepen itO how I cursed her  I have her now methinks before me blubberingHow odious does sorrow make an ugly faceThine Jack and this old beldam's in penitentials instead of moving compassion must evermore confirm hatred while Beauty in tears is beauty heighten'd and what my heart has ever delighted to see  What excuseConfound you and your cursed daughters what excuse can you make Is she not goneHas she not escapedBut before I am quite distracted before I commit half a hundred murders let me hear how it was  I HAVE heard her storyArt damn'd confounded wicked unpardonable Art in a woman of her characterBut shew me a woman and I'll shew thee a plotterThis plaguy sex is  Art  itself Every individual of it is a plotter by nature  This is the substance of the old wretch's account  She told me  'That I had no sooner left the vile house than Dorcas acquainted the Syren'  Do Jack let me call her namesI beseech thee Jack let me call her names  'than Dorcas acquainted her lady with it and that I had left word that I was gone to DoctorsCommons and should be heard of for some hours at the Horn there if inquired after by the counsellor or anybody else That afterwards I should be either at the CocoaTree or King'sArms and should not return till late She then urged her to take some refreshment'  'She was in tears when Dorcas approached her her saucy eyes swelled with weeping She refused either to eat or drink sighed as if her heart would break'  False devilish grief not the humble silent grief that only deserves pityContriving to ruin me to despoil me of all that I held valuable in the very midst of it  'Nevertheless being resolved not to see me for a week at least she ordered her to bring her up three or four French rolls with a little butter and a decanter  of water telling her she would dispense with her attendance and that should be all she would live upon in the interim So artful creature pretending to lay up for a week's siege'  For as to substantial food she no more than other angelsAngels said IThe devil take me if she shall be any more an angelFor she is odious in my eyes and I hate her mortally  But oh Lovelace thou lyestShe is all that is lovely All that is excellent  But  is  she  can  she be goneO how Miss Howe will triumphBut if that little Fury receive her Fate shall make me rich amends for then will I contrive to have them both  I was looking back for connexionbut the devil take connexion I have no business with it The contrary best befits distraction and that will soon be my lot  'Dorcas consulted the old wretch about obeying her O yes by all means for Mr Lovelace knew how to come at her at any time and directed a bottle of sherry to be added  'This chearful compliance so obliged her that she was prevailed upon to go up and look at the damage done by the fire and seemed not only shocked at it but satisfied it was no trick as she owned she had at first apprehended it to be All this made them secure and they laughed in their sleeves to think what a childish way of shewing her resentment she had found out Sally throwing out her witticisms that Mrs Lovelace was right however  not to quarrel with her bread and butter  '  Now this very childishness as  they  thought it in such a genius would have made  me  suspect either her head after what had happened the night before or her intention when the marriage was so far as she knew to be completed within the week she was resolved to secrete herself from me in the same house  'She sent Will with a letter to Wilson's directed to Miss Howe ordering him to inquire if there were not one for her there  'He only pretended to go and brought word there 'was none and put her letter in his pocket for me  'She then order'd him to carry another which she gave him to the HornTavern to meAll this done without any seeming hurry yet she appeared to be very solemn and put her handkerchief frequently to her eyes  'Will pretended to come to me with this letter but tho' the dog had the sagacity to mistrust something on her sending him out a second time and to  me  whom she had refused to see which he thought extraordinary and mentioned his mistrusts to Sally Polly and Dorcas yet they made light of his suspicions Dorcas assuring them all that her Lady seemed more stupid with her grief than active and that she really believed she was a little turned in her head and knew not what she didBut all of them depended upon her inexperience her open temper and upon her not making the least motion towards going out or to have a coach or chair called as sometimes she had done and still more upon the preparations she had made for a week's siege as I may call it  'Will went out pretending to bring the letter to me but quickly returned his heart still misgiving him on recollecting my frequent cautions that he was not to judge for himself when he had  positive  orders but if any doubt occurred from circumstances I could not foresee literally to follow them as the only way to avoid blame  'But it must have been in this little interval that she escaped for soon after his return they made fast the streetdoor and hatch the mother and the two nymphs taking a little turn into the garden Dorcas  going up stairs and Will to avoid being seen by his lady or his voice heard down into the kitchen  'About half an hour after Dorcas who had planted herself where she could see her Lady's door open had the curiosity to go to look through the keyhole having a misgiving as she said that her Lady might offer some violence to herself in the mood she had been in all day and finding the key in the door which was not very usual she tapped at it three or four times and having no answer opened it with Madam Madam did you callSupposing her in her closet  'Having no answer she stept forward and was astonished to find her not there She hastily ran into the diningroom then into my apartments searched every closet dreading all the time to behold some sad catastrophe  'Not finding her anywhere she ran down to the old creature and her nymphs with a Have you seen my LadyThen she's goneShe's nowhere above  'They were sure she could not be gone out  'The whole house was in an uproar in an instant some running up stairs some down from the upper rooms to the lower and all screaming How should they look me in the face  'Will cried out he was a dead man  He  blamed  them They him  and every one was an  accuser  and an  excuser  at the same time  'When they had searched the whole house and every closet in it ten times over to no purpose They took it into their heads to send to all the porters chairmen and hackney coachmen that had been near the house for two hours past to inquire if any of them saw Such a young Lady describing her  'This brought them some light The only dawning for hope that I can have and which keeps me  from absolute despair One of the chairmen gave them this account That he saw such a one come out of the house a little before four in a great hurry and as if frighted with a little parcel tied up in a handkerchief in her hand That he took notice to his fellow who plied her without her answering that she was a fine young lady That he'd warrant she had either a bad husband or very cross parents for that her eyes seemed swelled with crying Upon which a third fellow replied That it might be a Doe escaped from Mother  Damnable  's park This Mrs Sinclair told me with a curse and a wish that she knew the saucy villainShe thought truly that she had a better reputation so handsomely as she lived and so justly as she paid everybody for what she bought her house visited by the best and civillest of gentlemen and no noise or brawls ever heard or known in it  'From these appearances the fellow who gave this information had the curiosity to follow her unperceived She often looked back Everybody who passed her turned to look after her passing their verdicts upon her tears her hurry and her charming person till coming to a stand of coaches a coachman plied her was accepted alighted opened the coachdoor in a hurry seeing  her  hurry and in it she stumbled for haste and the fellow believed hurt her shins with the stumble'  The devil take me Belford if my generous heart is not moved for her notwithstanding her wicked deceit to think what must be her reflections and apprehensions at the timeA mind so delicate heeding no censures yet probably afraid of being laid hold of by a Lovelace in everyone she saw At the same time not knowing to what dangers she was going to expose herself nor of whom she could obtain shelter a stranger to the town and to all its ways the afternoon  far gone but little money and no cloaths but those she had on  It is impossible in this little interval since last night that Miss Howe's Townsend could be cooperating  But how she must abhor me to run all these risques how heartily must she detest me for my freedoms of last night O that she had had greater reason for a resentment so violentAs to her  Virtue  I am too much enraged to give her the merit due to that To Virtue it cannot be owing that she should fly from the charming prospects that were before her But to Malice Hatred Contempt HarlowePride the worst of Pride and to all the deadly passions that ever reigned in a female breastAnd if I can but recover herBut be still be calm be hushed my stormy passions for is it not Clarissa  Harlowe  must I say that thus I rave against  'The fellow heard her say Drive fast Very fast Where MadamTo Holborn Bars answered she repeating Drive very fastAnd up she pulled both the windows And he lost sight of the coach in a minute  'Will as soon as he had this intelligence speeded away in hopes to trace her out declaring that he would never think of seeing me till he had heard some tidings of his lady'  And now Belford all my hope is that this fellow who attended us in our airing to Hampstead to Highgate to Muzzlehill to KentishTown will hear of her at some one or other of those placesAnd on this I the rather build as I remember she was once after our return very inquisitive about the stages and their prices praising the conveniency to passengers in their going off every hour and this in Will's hearing who was then in attendance Woe be to the villain if he recollect not this  I HAVE been traversing her room meditating or taking up everything she but touched or used The glass she dressed at I was ready to break for not giving me the personal image it was wont to reflect of  her  whose idea is for ever present with me I call for her now in the tenderest now in the most reproachful terms as if within hearing Wanting  her  I want my own soul at least everything dear to it What a void in my heart what a chilness in my blood as if its circulation were arrested From her room to my own in the diningroom and in and out of every place where I have seen the beloved of my heart do I hurry in none can I tarry her lovely image in everyone in some lively attitude rushing cruelly upon me in differently remembered conversations  But when in my first fury at my return I went up two pair of stairs resolved to find the lockedup Dorcas and beheld the vainlyburnt windowboard and recollected my baffled contrivances baffled by my own weak folly I thought my distraction completed and down I ran as one frighted at a spectre ready to howl for vexation my head and my temples shooting with a violence I had never felt before and my back aching as if the vertebrae were disjointed and falling in pieces  But now that I have heard the mother's story and contemplated the dawning hopes given by the chairman's information I am a good deal easier and can make cooler reflections Most heartily pray I for Will's success every four or five minutes If I lose her all my rage will return with redoubled fury The disgrace to be thus outwitted by a novice an infant in stratagem and contrivance added to the violence of my passion for her will either break my heart or what saves many a heart in evils insupportable turn my brain What had I to do to go out a licencehunting at least till I had seen her and made up  matters with her And indeed were it not the privilege of a principal to lay all his own faults upon his underlings and never be to blame himself▪ I should be apt to reflect that I am more in fault than anybody And as the sting of this reflection will sharpen upon me if I recover her not how shall I be able to bear it  If ever  Here Mr Lovelace lays himself under a curse too shocking to be repeated if he revenge not himself upon the Lady should be once more get her into his hands  I HAVE just now dismissed the sniveling toad Dorcas who was introduced to me for my pardon by the whining mother I gave her a kind of negative and ungracious forgivenessYet I shall as violently curse the two nymphs byandby for the consequences of my own folly And this will be a good way too to prevent their ridicule upon me for losing so glorious an opportunity as I had last night or rather this morning  I have collected from the result of the inquiries made of the chairman and from Dorcas's observations before the cruel creature escaped a description of her dress and am resolved if I cannot otherwise hear of her to advertise her in the Gazette as an eloped wife both by her maiden and acknowleged name for her elopement will soon be known by every  Enemy  why then should not my  Friends  be made acquainted with it from whose inquiries and informations I may expect some tidings of her  She had on a brown lustring nightgown fresh and looking like new as every thing she wears does whether new or not from an elegance natural to her A beaver hat a black ribband about her neck and blue knots on her breast A quilted petticoat of carnation  coloured satten a rosediamond ring supposed on her finger and in her whole person and appearance as I shall express it a dignity as well as beauty that commands the repeated attention of everyone who sees her  The description of her person I shall take a little more pains about My mind must be more at ease before I can undertake that And I shall threaten that if after a certain period given for her voluntary return she be not heard of I will prosecute any person who presumes to entertain harbour abett or encourage her with all the vengeance that an injur'd gentleman and husband may be warranted to take by Law or otherwise  FRESH cause of aggravationBut for this scribling vein or I should still run mad  Again going into her chamber because it was hers and sighing over the bed and every piece of furniture in it I cast my eye towards the drawers of the dressingglass and saw peep out as it were in one of the halfdrawn drawers the corner of a letter I snatched it out and found it superscribed by her  To Mr Lovelace  The sight of it made my heart leap and I trembled so that I could hardly open the seal  How does this damn'd Love unman meBut nobody ever loved as I loveIt is even increased by her unworthy flight and my disappointment Ingrateful creature to fly from a passion thus ardently flaming which like the palm rises the more for being depressed and slighted  I will not give thee a copy of this letter I owe her not so much service  But wouldst thou think that this haughty promisebreaker could resolve as she does absolutely and for ever to renounce me for what passed last night That she could resolve to forego all her opening prospects of reconciliation  that  reconciliation with a worthless  family on which she had set her whole heartYet she doesShe acquits me of all obligation to her and herself of all expectations from meAnd for whatO that indeed I had given her real cause Damn'd confounded Niceness Prudery Affectation or pretty Ignorance if not AffectationBy my soul Belford I told thee allI was more indebted to her struggles than to my own forwardness I cannot support my own reflections upon a decency so illrequitedShe could not she would not have been so much a Harlowe in her resentment had I deserved as I  ought  to have done her resentment All she feared had then been over and her own goodsense and even modesty would have taught her to make the best of it  But if ever again I get her into my hands  Art  and more  Art  and  Compulsion  too if she make it necessary  and 'tis plain that nothing else will do  shall she experience from the man whose fear  of  her has been above even his passion  for  her and whose gentleness and forbearance she has thus  perfidiously  triumphed over Well says the Poet  'Tis nobler like a lion to invade  When appetite directs and seize my prey  Than to wait tamely like a begging dog  Till dull consent throws out the scraps of love  Thou knowest what I have so lately vowedAnd yet at times cruel creature and ingrateful as cruel I can subscribe with too much truth to those lines of another Poet  She reigns more fully in my soul than ever  She garisons my breast and mans against me  Ev'n my own rebel thoughts with thousand graces  Ten thousand charms and newdiscover'd beauties  LETTER LIV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  A Letter is put into my hands by Wilson himself  Such a letter  A letter from Miss Howe to her cruel friend  I made no scruple to open it  It is a miracle that I fell not into fits at the reading of it and at the thought of what might have been the consequence had it come to the hands of  this Clarissa Harlowe  Let my justlyexcited rage excuse my irreverence  Collins tho' not his day brought it this afternoon to Wilson's with a particular desire that it might be sent with all speed to Miss Beaumont's lodgings and given if possible into her own hands He had before been here at Mrs Sinclair's with intent to deliver it to her himself but was told  too truly told  that she was abroad but that they would give her any thing he should leave for her the moment she returnedBut he cared not to trust them with his business and went away to Wilson's as I find by the description of him at both places and there left the letter but not till he had a second time called here and found her not come in  The letter which I shall inclose for it is too long to transcribe will account to thee for his coming hither  O this devilish Miss HoweSomething must be resolved upon and done with that little Fury  THOU wilt see the margin of this cursed letter crouded with indices ☞ I put them to mark the  places devoted for vengeance or requiring animadversion Return thou it to me the moment thou hast read it  Read it here and avoid trembling for me if thou canst  To Miss  LAETITIA BEAUMONT    Wednesday June    My dearest Friend  YOU will perhaps think that I have been too long silent But I had begun two letters at different times since my last and written a great deal each time and with spirit enough I assure you  ☞  incensed as I was against the abominable wretch you are with particularly on reading yours of the st of the past month  See Letter  xxvi  of this Vol p      ☞  The  first  I intended to keep open till I could give you some account of my proceedings with Mrs Townsend It was some days before I saw her And this intervenient space giving me time to reperuse what I had written I thought it proper to lay that aside and to write in a stile a little less fervent  ☞  for you would have blamed me I know for the freedom of some of my expressions  execrations    ☞  if you please And when I had gone a good way in the  second  the change in your prospects on his communicating to you Miss Montague's letter and his better behaviour occasioning a change in your mind I laid that aside also And in this uncertainty thought I would wait to see the issue of affairs between you before I wrote again believing that all would soon be decided one way or other  I had still perhaps held this resolution as every appearance according to your letters was more and more promising had not the two passed days  furnished me with intelligence which it highly imports you to know  ☞  But I must stop here and take a little walk to try to keep down that just indignation which rises to my pen when I am about to relate to you what I must communicate  I AM not my own mistress enoughThen my motherAlways up and downAnd watching as if I were writing to a fellowBut I will try if I can contain myself in tolerable bounds  ☞    The women of the house where you areO my dearThe women of the houseBut you never thought highly of themSo it cannot be so very surprizingNor would you have staid so long with them  ☞  had not the notion of removing to one of your own made you less uneasy and less curious about their characters and behaviour Yet I could  now  wish  ☞  that you had been less reserved among themBut I teaze youIn short my dear  ☞  you are certainly in a devilish houseBe assured that the woman is one of the vilest of womenNor does she go to you by her right nameVery trueHer name is  not  SinclairNor is the street she lives in DoverstreetDid you never go out by yourself and discharge the coach or chair and return by another coach or chair  ☞  If you did yet I don't remember that you ever wrote to me that you did you would never have found your way to the vile house either by the woman's name  Sinclair  or by the street's name mentioned by that Doleman in his letter about the lodgings  Vol  III  p      ☞  The wretch might indeed have held out these false lights a little more excusably had the house been an honest house and had his end only been to prevent mischief from your brotherBut this contrivance  was antecedent as I think to your brother's project So that no excuse can be made for his intentions at the  time  The man whatever he may  now  intend was certainly then even  then  a villain in his heart  ☞  ☞  I AM excessively concerned that I should be prevailed upon between  your  overniceness on one hand and my  mother  's positiveness on the other to be satisfied without knowing how to direct to you at your lodgings I think too that the proposal that I should be put off to a  thirdhand  knowlege or rather veiled in a  firsthand  ignorance came from himand that it was only acquiesced in by you as it was by me  See Vol  III  p    and p    Where the Reader will observe that the proposal came from herself which as it was also mentioned by Mr Lovelace as will be seen in Miss Harlowe's letter p    she may be presumed to have forgot So that Clarissa had a double inducement for acquiescing with the proposed method of carrying on the correspondence between Miss Howe and herself by Wilson's conveyance and by the name of Laetitia Beaumont  upon needless and weak considerationsBecause truly I might have it to say if challenged that I knew not where to send to youI am ashamed of myselfHad this been at  first  excusable it could not be a good reason for going on in the folly when you had no liking to the house and when he began to play tricks  ☞  and delay with youWhat I was to mistrust myself was II was to allow it to be thought that I could not keep my own secret  ☞  But the house to be taken at this time and at that time led us both onlike fools  ☞  like tame fools in a stringUpon my life  ☞  my dear this man is a vile a contemptible villainI must speak outHow has he laughed  in his sleeve at us both I warrant for I can't tell how long  And yet who could have thought that a man of fortune and some  reputation  This Doleman I mean  ☞  not your wretch to be sureformerly a Rake indeedI have inquired after himlong ago and so was the easier satisfiedbut married to a woman of familyhaving had a palsyblowand one would think a penitentshould recommend such a houseWhy  ☞  my dear he could not  inquire  of it but must find it to be badto such a man as Lovelace to bring his future nay his  then  supposed bride to  ☞  I WRITE perhaps with too much violence to be clear But I cannot help it Yet I lay down my pen and take it up every ten minutes in order to write with some temperMy mother too in and outWhat need I she asks me lock myself in if I am only reading past correspondenciesfor that is my pretence when she comes poking in with her face sharpened to an edge  ☞  as I may say by a curiosity that gives her more pain than pleasureThe Lord forgive me  ☞  but I believe I shall huff her next time she comes in  Do  You  forgive me too my dear My mother  ought  because she says I am my father's girl and because I am sure I am  hers    ☞  I don't know what to doI don't know what to write nextI have so much to write yet have so little patience and so little opportunity  But I will tell you how I came by my intelligence  ☞  That  being a  fact  and requiring the less attention I will try to account to you for  that    Thus then it came about  'Miss Lardner whom you have seen at her cousin Biddulph's  saw you at St James's church on Sunday was fortnight She kept you in her eye during the whole time but could not once obtain the notice of yours tho' she courtesy'd to you twice She thought to pay her compliments to you when the Service was over for she doubted not but you were marriedand for an odd reason  because you came to church by yourself    ☞  Every eye as usual she said was upon you and this seeming to give you hurry and you being nearer the door than she you slid out before she could get to you But she ordered her servant to follow you till you were housed This servant saw you step into a chair which waited for you and you ordered the men to carry you to the place where they took you up  'The next day Miss Lardner sent the same servant out of mere curiosity to make private inquiry whether Mr Lovelace were or were not with you there And this inquiry brought out  ☞  from  different  people that the house was suspected to be one of those genteel wicked houses which receive and accommodate fashionable people of both sexes  'Miss Lardner confounded at this strange intelligence made further inquiry injoining secrecy to the servant she had sent as well as to the gentleman whom she employed Who had it confirmed from a rakish friend  ☞  who knew the house and told him that there were two houses the one in which all decent appearances were preserved and guests rarely admitted the other the receptacle of those who were absolutely engaged and broken to the vile yoke'    ☞  Saymy dear creaturesayShall I not execrate the wretchBut words are weakWhat can I say that will suitably express my abhorrence of such  a villain as he must have been when he meditated to bring a Clarissa Harlowe to such a place  'Miss Lardner kept this to herself some days not knowing what to do for she loves you and admires you of all women At last she revealed it but in confidence to Miss Biddulph by letter Miss Biddulph in like confidence being afraid it would distract  me  were I to know it communicated it to Miss Lloyd and so like a whisper'd scandal it passed through several canals and then it came to me Which was not till last Monday'  I thought I should have fainted upon the surprising communication But rage taking place it blew away the sudden illness  ☞  I besought Miss Lloyd to reinjoin secrecy to everyone I told her that I would not for the world that my mother  ☞  or any of your family should know it And I instantly caused a trusty friend to make what inquiries he could about Tomlinson  ☞  I had thoughts to have done it before But not imagining it to be needful and little thinking that you could be in such a house and as you were pleased with your changed prospects I forbore And the rather forbore  ☞  as the matter is so laid that Mrs Hodges is supposed to know nothing of the projected treaty of accommodation but on the contrary that it was designed to be a secret to her and to everybody but immediate parties and it was Mrs Hodges that I had proposed to found by a  second  hand  ☞  Now my dear it is certain without applying to that toomuch favoured housekeeper that there is not such a man within ten miles of your Uncle Very true One  Tomkins  there is about four miles off but he is a daylabourer And one  Thompson  about five miles distant the other way but he is a par  sh schoolmaster poor and about seventy  ☞  A man tho' but of  l  a year cannot come from one county to settle in another but everybody in both must know it and talk of it  ☞  Mrs Hodges may yet be sounded at a distance if you will Your uncle is an old man Old men imagine themselves under obligation to their paramours if younger than themselves and seldom keep any thing from their knowlege But if we suppose him to make a secret of the designed treaty  ☞  it is impossible  before  that treaty was thought of but she must have seen him at least have  heard  your uncle speak praisefully of a man he is said to be so intimate with let him have been ever so little a while in those parts  ☞  Yet methinks the story is so plausible Tomlinson as you describe him is so good a man and so much of a gentleman the end to be answered by his being an impostor  ☞  so much  more than necessary  if Lovelace has villainy in his head and as you are in such a houseYour wretch's behaviour to him was so petulant and lordly  ☞  and Tomlinson's answer so full of spirit and circumstance and then what he communicated to you of Mr Hickman's application to your uncle  ☞  and of Mrs Norton's to your mother some of which particulars I am satisfied his vile agent Joseph Leman could not reveal to his viler employer  ☞  his pressing on the marriageday in the name of your uncle which it could not answer any  wicked  purpose for him to do and what he writes of your uncle's proposal  ☞  to have it thought that you were married from the time that you had lived in one house together and that to be made to agree with the time of Mr Hickman's visit to your uncle The insisting on a trusty person's being present at the ceremony  ☞  at that uncle's nominationThese things make me willing to try for a tolerable construction to be made of all tho' I am so much  puzzled by what occurs on both sides of the question  ☞  that I cannot but abhor the devilish wretch whose inventions and contrivances are for ever employing an inquisitive head  ☞  without affording the means of absolute detection  But this is what I am ready to conjecture that Tomlinson specious as he is is a machine of Lovelace and that he is employed for some end which has not yet been answered  ☞  This is certain that not only Tomlinson but Mennell who I think attended you more than once at this vile house must know it to  be  a vile house  What can you then think of Tomlinson's declaring himself in  favour  of it upon inquiry  Lovelace too must know it to be so if not before he brought you to it soon after  ☞  Perhaps the  company he found there  may be the most probable way of accounting for his bearing with the house and for his strange suspensions of marriage when it was in his power to call such an angel of a woman his  ☞  O my dear the man is a villain the greatest of villains in every lightI am convinced that he isAnd this Doleman must be another of his implements  ☞  There are so many wretches who think  that  to be no sin which is one of the greatest and the most ingrateful of all sins to ruin young creatures of our sex who place their confidence in them that the wonder is less than the shame that people of figure of  appearance  at least are found to promote the horrid purposes of profligates of fortune and interest  ☞  But can I think you will ask with indignant astonishment that Lovelace can have designs upon your honour  ☞  That such designs he  has had  if he  still  hold them not I can have no doubt now that I know  the house he has brought you to to be a vile one This is a clue that has led me to account for all his behaviour to you ever since you have been in his hands  Allow me a brief retrospection of it all  ☞  We both know that Pride Revenge and a delight to tread in unbeaten paths are principal ingredients in the character of this finished libertine  ☞  He hates all your family yourself excepted and I have several times thought that I have seen him stung and mortified that Love has obliged him to kneel at your footstool because you are a  Harlowe    ☞  Yet is this wretch a Savage in LoveLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits has not been able to subdue his  ☞  His  pride  and the credit which a few  plausible qualities  sprinkled among his  odious ones    ☞  have given him have secured him too good a reception from our eyejudging our undistinguishing our selfflattering our tooconfiding Sex to make assiduity and obsequiousness and a conquest of his unruly passions any part of his study  ☞  He has some reason for his animosity to  all  the men and to  one  woman of your family He has always shewn you and all his own family too that he prefers his Pride to his Interest  ☞  He is a declared marriagehater A notorious intriguer Full of his inventions and glorying in themHe never could draw you in to declarations of Love Nor till your  wise  relations persecuted you as they did to receive his addresses as a Lover  ☞  He knew that you professedly disliked him for his immoralities he could not therefore justly blame you for the coldness and indifference of your behaviour to him  ☞  The prevention of mischief was your first main view in the correspondence he drew you into  He ought not then to have wonder'd that you declared your preference of the  Single Life  to  any  matrimonial engagement He knew that this was  always  your preference and that before he tricked you away so artfully  ☞  What was his conduct to you afterwards that you should of a sudden change it  Thus was your whole behaviour regular consistent and dutiful to those to whom by birth you owed duty and neither prudish coquetish nor tyrannical to him  ☞  He had agreed to go on with you upon those your own terms and to rely only on his own merits and future reformation for your favour  It was plain to me indeed to whom you communicated all that  you know  of your own heart tho' not all of it that  I found out  that Love had pretty early gained footing in it And this you yourself would have discovered sooner than you did  ☞  had not his alarming his unpolite his rough conduct kept it under  ☞  I knew by experience that Love is a fire that is not to be played with without burning one's fingers I knew it to be a dangerous thing for two single persons of different sexes to enter into familiarity and correspondence with each other since as to the latter must not a person be capable of premeditated art who can sit down to write and not write from the heartAnd a woman to write her heart to a man practised in deceit or even to a man of some character what advantage does it give him over her  ☞  As this man's vanity had made him imagine that no woman could be proof against Love when his address was honourable no wonder that he struggled like a lion held in toils against a passion that he thought not returnedAnd how could you  at first  shew a return in love  fierce a spirit and who had seduc  vile artifices but to the approval of those artifices  ☞  Hence perhaps it is not difficult to believe that it became possible for such a wretch as this to give way to his old prejudices against marriage and to that Revenge which had always been a first passion with him  This is the only way I think to account for his horrid views in bringing you to a vile house  And now may not all the rest be naturally accounted for  ☞  His delaysHis teazing waysHis bringing you to bear with his lodging in the same houseHis making you pass to the people of it as his wife tho' restrictively so yet with hope  ☞  no doubt vilest of villains as he is to take you at advantage  ☞  His bringing you into the company of his libertine companions The attempt of imposing upon you that Miss Partington for a bedfellow very probably his own invention for the worst of purposes His terrifying you at many different times His obtruding himself upon you when you went out to church no doubt to prevent your finding out what the people were The advantages he made of your brother's foolish project with Singleton  See my dear how naturally all this follows from the discovery made by Miss LardnerSee how the monster  ☞  whom I thought and so often called a  fool  comes out to have been all the time one of the greatest villains in the world  ☞  But if this be so what it would be asked by an indifferent person has hitherto saved you Glorious creatureWhat morally speaking but your watchfulness What but That and the majesty of your virtue  the native dignity  which in a situation so very difficult friendless destitute  passing for a wife cast into the company of creatures accustomed to betray and ruin innocent hearts has hitherto enabled you to baffle overawe and confound such a dangerous libertine as this so habitually remorseless as you have observed him to be so very various in his temper so inventive so seconded so supported so instigated too probably as he has beenThat  native dignity  that  heroism  I will call it which has on all proper occasions exerted itself in its  full  lustre  ☞  unmingled with that charming obligingness and condescending sweetness which is evermore the  softner  of that dignity when your mind is free and unapprehensive  ☞  Let me stop to admire and to bless my beloved friend who unhappily for herself at an age so tender unacquainted as she was with the world and with the vile arts of libertines having been called upon to sustain the hardest and most shocking trials from persecuting Relations on one hand and from a villainous Lover on the other has been enabled to give such an illustrious example of fortitude and prudence as never woman gave before her and who as I have heretofore observed  See p    has made a far greater figure in adversity than she possibly could have made had all her shining qualities been exerted in their full force and power  ☞  by the continuance of that prosperous run of fortune which attended her for Eighteen years of life out of Nineteen  ☞  BUT now my dear do I apprehend that you are in greater danger than ever yet you have been in if you are not married in a week and yet stay in this abominable house For were you out of it I own I should not be much afraid for you  These are my thoughts on the most deliberate consideration  ☞  'That he is now convinced that he has not been able to draw you off your guard That therefore if he can obtain no new advantage over you as he goes along he is resolved to do you all the  poor justice  that it is in the power of such a wretch as he to do you He is the rather induced to this as he sees that all his own family have warmly engaged themselves in your cause and that it is his  highest interest  to be just to you  ☞  Then the horrid wretch loves you as well he may above all women I have no doubt of thisWith  such  a love as such a wretch is capable of With  such  a love as Herod loved his Mariamne  ☞  He is now therefore very probably at last in earnest'  I took time for inquiries of different natures as I knew by the train you are in that whatever his designs are they cannot ripen either for good or evil  ☞  till something shall result from this new device of his about Tomlinson and your uncle  Device  I have no doubt that it is whatever this dark this impenetrable spirit intends by it  ☞  And yet I find it to be true that Counsellor Williams whom Mr Hickman knows to be a man of eminence in his profession has actually as good as finished the settlements That two draughts of them have been made  ☞  one avowedly to be sent to one Captain Tomlinson as the clerk saysAnd I find that a license has actually been more than once endeavoured to be obtained and that difficulties have hitherto been made equally to Lovelace's vexation and disappointment  ☞  My mother's proctor who is very intimate with the proctor applied to by the wretch has come at this information in confidence and hints that as Mr Lovelace is a man of high fortunes these difficulties will probably be got over  But here follow the causes of my apprehension of your danger  ☞  which I should not have had a thought of since nothing  very  vile has yet been attempted but on finding what a house you are in and on that discovery laying together and ruminating on past occurrences  'You are obliged from the present favourable appearances  ☞  to give him your company when ever he requests itYou are under a necessity of forgetting or seeming to forget past disobligations and to receive his addresses as those of a betrothed loverYou will incur the censure of prudery and affectation even perhaps in your own apprehension if you keep him at that distance which has hitherto been your securityHis sudden and as suddenly recovered illness  ☞  has given him an opportunity to find out that you love him  Alas my dear I knew you loved him  He is as you relate every hour more and more an incroacher  ☞  upon it He has seem'd to change his nature and is all love and gentleness The wolf has put on the sheep's cloathing yet more than once has shewn his teeth and his hardly sheathed claws  ☞  The instance you have given of his freedom with your person which you could not but resent and yet as matters are circumstanced between you could not but pass over when Tomlinson's letter called you into his company  See p    of this Volume  shew the advantage he has now over you  ☞  and also that if he can obtain greater he willAnd for this very reason as I apprehend it is that Tomlinson is introduced that is to say to give you the greater security  ☞  and to be a mediator if mortal offence be given you by any villainous attemptThe day seems not now to be so  much in your power as it ought to be since That now partly depends on your uncle whose presence at your own motion he has wished on the occasionA wish were all real very unlikely I think to be granted'  ☞  And thus situated should he offer greater freedoms must you not forgive him  I fear nothing as I know who has said that devil carnate or incarnate can fairly do against a virtue so established  See Mrs Norton's letter p    of this Volume  But surprizes  ☞  my dear in such a house as that you are in and in such circumstances as I have mentioned I greatly fear  ☞  The man one who has already triumphed over persons worthy of his alliance  ☞  What then have you to do but to fly this house this infernal houseO that your heart would let you sly  him  ☞  If you should be disposed so to do Mrs Townsend shall be ready at your commandBut if you meet with no impediments no new causes of doubt I think your reputation in the eye of the world tho' not your happiness is concerned that you should be hisAnd yet I cannot bear that these libertines should be rewarded for their villainy with the best of the Sex  ☞  when the worst of it are too good for them  But if you meet with the least ground for suspicion if he would detain you at the odious house or wish you to stay now you know what the people are  ☞  fly  him  whatever your prospects are as well as  them    In one of your next airings if you have no other way  ☞  refuse to return with him Name  me  for your intelligencer that you are in a bad house and if you think you cannot now break with him seem rather to believe that he may not know it to be so and that I do not believe he does And  yet this belief in us both must appear to be very gross  ☞  ☞  But suppose you desire and insist upon it to go out of town for the air this sultry weatherYou may plead your health for so doing He dare not resist such a plea Your brother's foolish scheme I am told is certainly given up so you need not be afraid on that account  If you do not fly the house upon reading of this or some way or other get out of it I shall judge of his power over you by the little you will have over either him or yourself  ☞  One of my informants has made slight inquiries concerning Mrs Fretchville Did he ever name to you the street or square she lived inI don't remember that you in any of yours mentioned either to me  ☞  Strange very strange This I think No such person or house can be found near any of the new streets or squares where the lights I had from your letters led me to imagine her house might be  ☞  Ask him What street the house is in if he has not told you And let me know If he make a difficulty of that circumstance it will amount to a detection  ☞  And yet I think you have enough without this  I shall send this long letter by Collins who changes his day to oblige me and that he may try now I know where you are to get it into your own hands If he cannot he will leave it at Wilson's As none of our letters by that conveyance have miscarried when you have been in more  apparently  disagreeable situations than you are in at present I hope that This will go safe if Collins should be obliged to leave it there  ☞  I wrote a short letter to you in my first agitations It contained not above twenty lines all full of fright alarm and execration But being afraid that my vehemence would too much affect  you I thought it better to wait a little as well for the reasons already hinted at as to be able to give you as many particulars as I could and my thoughts upon all And now I think taking to your aid other circumstances as they  have  offer'd or  may  offer you will be sufficiently armed to resist all his machinations be they what they will  ☞  One word more Command me up if I can be of the least service or pleasure to you I value not same I value not censure nor even life itself I verily think as I do your honour and your friendshipFor is not your honour my honour And is not your friendship the pride of my life  May heaven preserve you my dearest creature in honour and safety is the prayer the hourly prayer of  Your everfaithful and affectionate  ANNA HOWE  Thursday Morn  I have written all night  To Miss  HOWE    My dearest creature  HOW you have shock'd confounded surpriz'd astonish'd me by your dreadful communicationMy  heart is too weak  to bear up against such a stroke as thisWhen all hope was with me When my prospects were so much mendedBut can there be such villainy in men as in this vile principal and equally vile agent  I am really illVery illGrief and surprize and now I will say despair have overcome meAll all you have laid down as conjecture appears to me now to be  more  than conjecture  O that your mother would have the goodness to permit me the presence of the only comforter that my  afflicted my halfbroken heart could be raised by But I charge you think not of coming up without her indulgent permissionI am too ill at present my dear to think of combating with this dreadful man and of flying from this horrid houseMy bad writing will shew you thisBut my illness will be my present security should he indeed have meditated villainyForgive O forgive me my dearest friend the trouble I have given youAll must soonBut why add I grief to grief and trouble to troubleBut I charge you my beloved creature not to think of coming up without your mother's leave to the truly desolate and brokenspirited  CLARISSA HARLOWE  WELL JackAnd what thinkest thou of this last letterMiss Howe values not either  fame  or  censure  and thinkest thou that this letter will not bring the little fury up tho' she could procure no other conveyance than her higgler's paniers one for herself the other for her maidShe knows where to come nowMany a little villain have I punished for knowing more than I would have her know and that by adding to her knowlege and experienceWhat thinkest thou Belford if by getting hither this virago and giving  cause  for a lamentable letter from her to the fair fugitive I should be able to recover  her  Would she not visit that friend in  her  distress thinkest thou whose intended visit to her in  hers  brought her into the condition she herself had so perfidiously escaped from  Let me enjoy the thought  Shall I send this letterThou seest I have left room if I fail in the exact imitation of so charming a hand to avoid too strict a scrutinyDo they not both deserve it of meSeest thou not how the raveing girl threatens her motherOught she not to be punish'dAnd can I be a worse devil or villain or  monster than she calls me in this letter and has called me in her former letters were I to punish them both as my vengeance urges me to punish them And when I have executed That my vengeance how charmingly satisfied may they both go down into the country and keep house together and have a much better reason than their pride could give them for living the Singlelife they have both seemed so fond of  I will set about transcribing it this moment I think I can resolve afterwards Yet what has poor Hickman done to deserve this of meBut gloriously would it punish the mother as well as daughter for all her sordid avarice and for her undutifulness to honest Mr Howe whose heart she actually broke I am on tiptoe Jack to enter upon this projectIs not one country as good to me as another if I should be obliged to take another tour upon it  BUT I will not venture Mr Hickman is a good man they tell me I love a good man I hope one of these days to be a good man myself Besides I have heard within this week something of this honest fellow that shews he has a soul when I thought if he had one that it lay a little of the deepest to emerge to notice except on very extraordinary occasions and that then it presently sunk again into its  Cellula adiposa  The man is a  plump man  Didst ever see him Jack  But the principal reason that withholds me for 'tis a tempting project is for fear of being utterly blown up if I should not be quick enough with my letter or if Miss Howe should deliberate on setting out or try her mother's consent first in which time a letter from my frighted beauty might reach her for I have no doubt whereever she has refuged but her first work was to write to her vixen friend I will therefore go on patiently and take my revenge upon the little fury at my leisure  But in spite of my compassion for Hickman whose better character is sometimes my envy and who is one of those mortals that bring clumsiness into credit with the  mothers  to the disgrace of us clever fellows and often to our disappointment with the  daughters  and who has been very busy in assisting these doublearm'd beauties against me I swear by all the  Dii Majores  as well as  Minores  that I will have Miss Howe if I cannot have her more exalted friendAnd then if there be so much flaming love between these girls as they pretend what will my charmer profit by her escape  And now that I shall permit Miss Howe to reign a little longer let me ask thee If thou hast not in the inclosed letter a  fresh  instance that a great many of my difficulties with her sistertoast are owing to this flighty girl'Tis true that here was naturally a confounded sharp wintry air and if a little cold water was thrown into the path no wonder that it was instantly frozen and that a poor honest traveller found it next to impossible to keep his way one foot sliding back as fast as the other advanced to the endangering of his limbs or neck But yet I think it impossible that she should have baffled me as she has done novice as she is and never before from under her parents wing had she not been armed by a virago who was formerly very near shewing that she could better advise than practise But this I believe I have said more than once before  I am loth to  reproach myself  now the cruel creature has escaped me for what would that do but add to my torment Since evils selfcaused and avoidable admit not of palliation or comfort And yet if  thou  tellest me that all  her  strength was owing to  my  weakness and that I have been a cursed coward in this whole affair why then Jack I may blush and be vexed but by my soul I cannot contradict thee  But this Belford I hopethat if I can turn the poison of this letter into wholsome aliment that is to say if I can make use of it to my advantage I shall have  thy  free consent to do it  I am always careful to open covers cautiously and to preserve seals intire I will draw out from this cursed letter an alphabet Nor was Nick Rowe ever half so diligent to learn Spanish at the Quixote recommendation of a certain Peer as I will be to gain a mastery of this vixen's hand  LETTER LV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Thursday Evening June    AFter my last so full of other hopes the contents of This will surprise you O my dearest friend the man has at last proved himself to be a villain It was with the utmost difficulty last night that I preserved myself from the vilest dishonour He extorted from me a promise of forgiveness and that I would see him next day as if nothing had happened But if it were possible to escape from a wretch who as I have too much reason to believe formed a plot to fire the house to frighten me almost naked into his arms how could I see him next day  I have escaped Heaven be praised I have And have now no other concern than that I fly from the only hope that could have made such an husband tolerable to me The reconciliation with my friends so agreeably undertaken by my uncle  All my present hope is To find some reputable family or person of my own Sex who is obliged to go beyond sea or who lives abroad I care not whither but if I might choose in some one of our American coloniesNever to be heard of more by my relations whom I have so grievously offended  Nor let your generous heart be moved at what I write If I can escape the dreadfullest part of my father's malediction for the temporary part is already in a manner fulfilled which makes me tremble in apprehension of the other I shall think the wreck of my worldly fortunes a happy composition  Neither is there need of the renewal of your so often tender'd goodness to me For I have with me rings and other valuables that were sent me with my cloaths which will turn into money to answer all I can want till Providence shall be pleased to put me into some way to help myself if for my further punishment my life is to be lengthen'd beyond my wishes  Impute not this scheme my beloved friend either to dejection on one hand or to that romantic turn on the other which we have supposed generally to obtain with our Sex from Fifteen to Twentytwo For be pleased to consider my unhappy situation in the light in which it really must appear to every considerate person who knows it In the first place the man who has had the assurance to think me and to endeavour to make me his  property  will hunt me and to place to place and search after me as an estray And he knows he may do so with impunity for whom have I to protect me from him  Then as to my estate the enviable estate which has been the original cause of all my misfortunes it shall never be mine upon litigated terms What is there in being enabled to boast that I am worth more than  I can use  or  wish to use  And if my power is circumscribed I shall not have that to answer for which I should have if I did not use it as I ought Which very few do I shall have no husband of whose interest I ought to be so regardful as to prevent me doing  more  than justice to others that I may not do  less  to himIf therefore my father will be pleased as I shall presume in proper time to propose to him to pay two annuities out of it one to my  dear Mrs Norton which may make her easy for the remainder of her life as she is now growing into years the other of  l per annum  to the same good woman for the use of  My poor  as I have had the vanity to call a certain set of people concerning whom she knows all my mind that so as few as possible may suffer by the consequences of my error God bless them and give them heart'sease and content with the rest  Other reasons for my taking the step I have hinted at are these  This wicked man knows I have no friend in the world but you Your neighbourhood therefore would be the first he would seek for me in were you to think it possible for me to be concealed in it And in this case You might be subjected to inconveniencies greater even than those which you have already sustained on my account  From my cousin Morden were he to come I could not hope protection since by his letter to me it is evident that my brother has engaged him in his party Nor would I by any means subject so worthy a man to danger as might be the case from the violence of this ungovernable spirit  These things considered what better method can I take than to go abroad to some one of the English colonies where nobody but yourself shall know anything of me nor You let me tell you presently nor till I am fixed and if it please God in a course of living tolerably to my mind For it is no small part of my concern that my indiscretions have laid so heavy a tax upon You my dear friend to whom once I hoped to give more pleasure than pain  I am at present at one Mrs Moore's at Hampstead My heart misgave me at coming to this village because I had been here with him more than once But the coach hither was so ready a conveniency that I knew not what to do better Then I shall stay here no longer than till I can receive your  answer to this In which you will be pleased to let me know if I cannot be hid according to your former contrivance Happy had I given into it at the time by Mrs Townsend's assistance till the heat of his search be over The Deptford road I imagine will be the right direction to hear of a passage and to get safely aboard  O why was the great fiend of all unchained and permitted to assume so specious a form and yet allowed to conceal his feet and his talons till with the one he was ready to trample upon my honour and to strike the other into my heartAnd what had I done that he should be let loose particularly upon me  Forgive me this murmuring question the effect of my impatience my  guilty  impatience I doubt For as I have escaped with my honour and nothing but my worldly prospects and my pride my ambition and my vanity have suffered in this wreck of my hopefuller fortunes may I not still be more happy than I deserve to be And is it not in my own power still by the divine favour to secure the great stake of all And who knows that this very path into which my inconsideration has thrown me strew'd as it is with briars and thorns which tear in pieces my gaudier trappings may not be the right path to lead me into the great road to my future happiness which might have been endanger'd by evil communication  And after all Are there not still more deserving persons than I who never failed in any capital point of duty that have been more humbled than myself and some too by the errors of parents and relations by the tricks and baseness of guardians and trustees and in which their own rashness or folly had no part  I will then endeavour to make the best of my present lot And join with me my best my only friend in praying That my punishment may end here and that my present afflictions may be sanctified to me  This letter will enable you to account for a line or  two which I sent to Wilson's to be carried to you only for a feint to get his servant out of the way He seemed to be left as I thought for a spy upon me But returning too soon I was forced to write a few lines for him to carry to his Master to a tavern near DoctorsCommons with the same view And this happily answered my end  I wrote early in the morning a bitter letter to the wretch which I left for him obvious enough and I suppose he has it by this time I kept no copy of it I shall recollect the contents and give you the particulars of all at more leisure  I am sure you will approve of my escapeThe rather as the people of the house must be very vile For they and that Dorcas too did hear me I know they did cry out for help If the fire had been other than a villainous plot altho' in the morning to blind them I pretended to think it otherwise they would have been alarmed as much as I and have run in hearing me scream to  comfort me  supposing my terror was the fire to  relieve me  supposing it were anything else But the vile Dorcas went away as soon as she saw the wretch throw his arms about meBless me my dear I had only my slippers and an underpetticoat on I was frighted out of my bed by her cries of fire and that I should be burnt to ashes in a momentAnd she to go away and never to return nor anybody else And yet I heard womens voices in the next room indeed I didAn evident contrivance of them allGod be praised I am out of their house  My terror is not yet over I can hardly think myself safe Every welldressed man I see from my windows whether on horseback or on foot I think to be him  I know you will expedite an answer A man and horse will be procured me tomorrow early to carry This To be sure you cannot return an answer by the  same man because you must see Mrs Townsend first Nevertheless I shall wait with impatience till you  can  having no friend but you to apply to and being such a stranger to this part of the world that I know not which way to turn myself whither to go nor what to doWhat a dreadful hand have I made of it  Mrs Moore at whose house I am is a widow and of a good character And of this one of her neighbours of whom I bought a handkerchief purposely to make inquiry before I would venture informed me  I will not set my foot out of doors till I have your direction And I am the more secure having dropt words to the people of the house where the coach set me down as if I expected a chariot to meet me in my way to Hendon a village a little distance from thisAnd when I left their house I walked backward and forward upon the hill at first not knowing what to do and afterwards to be certain that I was not watched before I ventured to inquire after a lodging  You will direct for me my dear by the name of Mrs Harriot Lucas  Had I not made my escape when I did I was resolved to attempt it again and again He was gone to the Commons for a licence as he wrote me word for I refused to see him notwithstanding the promise he extorted from me  How hard how nextto impossible my dear to avoid many lesser deviations when we are betrayed into a capital one  For fear I should not get away at my first effort I had apprised him that I would not set eye upon him under a week in order to gain myself time for it in different waysAnd were I so to have been watched as to have made it necessary I would after such an instance of the connivance of the women of the house have run out into the street and thrown myself into the  next house I could have enter'd or claimed protection from the first person I had metWomen to desert the cause of a poor creature of their own Sex in such a situation what must they beThen such poor guilty sort of figures did they make in the morning after he was gone outso earnest to get me up stairs and to convince me by the scorched windowboards and burnt curtains and vallens that the fire was realthat although I seemed to believe all they would have me believe I was more and more resolved to get out of their house at all adventures  When I began I thought to write but a few lines But be my subject what it will I know not how to conclude when I write to you It was  always  so It is not therefore owing peculiarly to that most interesting and unhappy situation which you will allow however to engross at present the whole mind of  Your unhappy but everaffectionate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LVI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Friday morning past Two o'clock  IO Triumphe  Io Clarissa singOnce more what a happy man thy friendA silly dear novice to be heard to tell the coachman whither to carry herAnd to go to  Hampstead  of all the villages about LondonThe place where we had been together more than once  Methinks I am sorry she managed no betterI shall find the recovery of her too easy a task I fear Had she but known how much difficulty enhances the value of any thing with me and had she had the least notion of obliging me she would never have stopt short at  Hampstead  surely  Well but after all this exultation thou wilt ask  If I have already got back my charmerI have notBut knowing where she is is almost the same thing as having her in my power And it delights me to think how she will start and tremble when I first pop upon her How she will look with conscious guilt that will more than wipe off my guilt of Wednesday night when she sees her injured lover and acknowleged husband from whom the greatest of felonies she would have stollen herself  But thou wilt be impatient to know how this came about Read the inclosed here and remember the instructions which from time to time I have given my fellow in apprehension of such an elopement and that will tell thee all and what I may reasonably expect from the rascal's diligence and management if he wishes ever to see my face again  I received it about half an hour ago just as I was going to lie down in my cloaths And it has made me so much alive that midnight as it is I have sent for a Blunt's chariot to attend me here by daypeep with  my usual coachman  if possible and knowing not else what to do with myself I sat down and in the joy of my heart have not only wrote thus far but have concluded upon the measures I shall take when admitted to her presence For well am I aware of the difficulties I shall have to contend with from her perverseness  Honnored Sur  THIS is to sertifie your honner as how I am heer at Hamestet wher I have found

not look into your Honner's fase if I had not found out my Lady thoff she was gone off the prems's in a quartir off an hour as a man may say so I knowed you would be glad at  heart to know I had found her out And so I send thiss Petur Partrick who is to haf shillins it being now nere of the clock at nite for he would not stur without a hartie drinck too besides And I was willing all shulde be snug likewayes at the logins befoer I sent  I have munny of youre Honner's but I thout as how if the man was payed by me beforend he mought play trix so left that to youre Honner  My Lady knows nothing of my being hereaway But I thoute it best not to leve the plase because she has ta  ken the logins but for a fue nites  If your Honner cum to the Upper Flax I will be in site all the day about the Tapphouse or the Hethe I have borroued an othir cote instead off your Honner's liferie and a blacke wigge soe cannot be knoen by my Lady iff as howe she shuld see me And have made as if I had the tootheake so with my hancriffe at my mothe the tethe which your Honner was plesed to bett out with your honner's fyste and my dam'd wide mothe as youre Honner notifys it to be cannot be knoen to be mine  The tow inner letters I had from my Lady before she went off the prems's One was to be left at Mr Wilson's for Miss Howe The next was to be for your Honner But I knew you was not at the plase directed and being afear'd of what fell out so I kept them for your Honner and so could not give um to you until I seed you Miss How's I only made belief to her Ladiship as I carred it and sed as how there was nothing left for hur as shee wished to knoe So here they be bothe  I am may it pless your Honner  Your Honner's most dutiful and wonce more happy servant  WM SUMMERS  THE two  inner  letters as Will calls them 'tis plain were wrote for no other purpose but to send him out of the way with them and one of them to amuse me That directed to Miss Howe is only this  Thursday June    I Write this my dear Miss Howe only for a feint and to see if it will go current I shall write at large very soon if not miserably prevented  CL H  Now Jack will not her  feints  justify mine Does she not invade my province thinkest thou And is it not now fairly come to  Who shall most deceive and cheat the other  So I thank my stars we are upon a par at last as to this pointWhich is a great ease to my conscience thou must believe And if what Hudibras tells us is true the dear fugitive has also abundance of pleasure to come  Doubtless the pleasure is as great  In being cheated as to cheat  As lookerson find most delight  Who least perceive the juggler's sleight  And still the less they understand  The more admire the sleight of hand  THIS is my dear juggler's letter to me the other  inner  letter sent by Will  Thursday June    Mr Lovelace  DO not give me cause to dread your return If you would not that I should hate you for ever send me half a line by the bearer to assure me that you will not attempt to see me for a week to come I cannot look you in the face without equal confusion and indignation The obliging me in This is but a poor atonement for your last night's vile behaviour  You may pass this time in a journey to your uncle's  and I cannot doubt if the Ladies of your family are as favourable to me as you have assured me they are but that you will have interest enough to prevail with one of them to oblige me with her company After your baseness of last night you will not wonder that I insist upon this proof of your future honour  If Captain Tomlinson comes mean time I can hear what he has to say and send you an account of it  But in less than a week if you see me it must be owing to a fresh act of violence of which you know not the consequence  Send me the requested line if ever you expect to have the forgiveness confirmed the promise of which you extorted from  The Unhappy  CL H  Now Belford what canst thou say in behalf of this sweet rogue of a Lady What  canst  thou say for her 'Tis apparent that she was fully determined upon an elopement when she wrote it And thus would she make me of party against myself by drawing me in to give her a week's time to compleat it in And wickeder still send me upon a fool's errand to bring up one of my cousinsWhen we came to have the satisfaction of finding her gone off and me exposed for everWhat punishment can be bad enough for such a little villain of a Lady  But mind moreover how plausibly she accounts by this billet supposing she had no opportunity of eloping before I returned for the resolution of not seeing me for a week and for the bread and butter expedientSo childish as we thought it  The chariot is not come and if it were it is yet too soon for everything but my impatience And as I have already taken all my measures and can think of nothing but my triumph I will resume her violent letter in order to strengthen my resolutions against  her I was  before  in too gloomy a way to proceed with it But now the subject is all alive to me and my gayer fancy like the sunbeams will irradiate it and turn the solemn deep green into a brighter verdure  When I have called upon my charmer to explain some parts of her letter and to atone for others I will send it or a copy of it to thee  Suffice it at present to tell thee in the first place that  she is determined never to be my wife  To be sure there ought to be no compulsion in so material a case Compulsion was her parents fault which I have censured so severely that I shall hardly be guilty of the same And I am glad I know her mind as to this essential point  I have  ruined  her she saysNow that's a fib take it in her own wayIf I had she would not perhaps have run away from me  She is  thrown upon the wide world  Now I own that HampsteadHeath affords very pretty and very  extensive  prospects but 'tis not the  wide world  neither And suppose  that  to be her grievance I hope soon to restore her to a  narrower    I am the  enemy of her soul as well as of her honour  Confoundedly severe Nevertheless another fibFor I love her soul very well but think no more of it in this case than of my own  She is to be  thrown upon strangers  And is not that her own faultMuch against my will I am sure  She is cast from a state of  independency into one of obligation  She never was in a state of  independency  nor is it fit a woman should of any age or in any state of life And as to the state of obligation there is no such thing as living without being beholden to somebody Mutual obligation is the very essence and soul of the social and commercial lifeWhy should  she  be exempt from itI am sure the person she raves  at desires not such an exemptionhas been long  dependent  upon her and would rejoice to owe  further obligations  to her than he can boast of hitherto  She talks of her  father's curse  But have I not repaid him for it an hundredfold in the same coin But why must the faults of other people be laid at my door Have I not enow of my own  But the greyeyed dawn begins to peepLet me sum up all  In short then the dear creature's letter is a collection of invectives not very new to  me  though the occasion for them no doubt is new to  her  A little sprinkling of the romantic and contradictory runs thro' it She loves and she hates She encourages me to pursue her by telling me I safely may and yet she begs I will not She apprehends poverty and want yet resolves to give away her estate To gratify whomWhy in short those who have been the cause of her misfortunes And finally tho' she resolves never to be mine yet she has some regrets at leaving me because of the opening prospects of a reconciliation with her friends  But never did morning dawn so tardily as thisThe chariot not yet come neither  A GENTLEMAN to speak with me DorcasWho can want me thus early  Captain Tomlinson sayst thou Surely he must have travelled all nightEarly riser as I am how could he think to find me up  thus  early  Let but the chariot come and he shall accompany me in it to the bottom of the hill tho' he return to town on foot for the Captain is all obliging goodness that I may hear all he has to say and tell him all my mind and lose no time  Well now am I satisfied that this rebellious flight will turn to my advantage as all crush'd rebellions do to the advantage of a Sovereign in possession  DEAR Captain I rejoice to see you Just in the nick of timeSee See  The rosyfinger'd morn appears  And from her mantle shakes her tears  The sun arising mortals chears  And drives the rising mists away  In promise of a glorious day  Excuse me Sir that I salute you from my favourite Bard He that rises with the Lark will sing with the Lark Strange news since I saw you Captain Poor mistaken LadyBut you have too much goodness I know to reveal to her uncle Harlowe the errors of this capricious Beauty It will all turn out for the best You must accompany me part of the way I know the delight you take in composing differences But 'tis the task of the Prudent to heal the breaches made by the rashness and folly of the Imprudent  AND now all around me so still and so silent the rattling of the chariotwheels at a street's distance do I hearAnd to this angel of a Lady I fly  Reward O God of Love the cause is thy own reward thou as it deserves my suffering persevereanceSucceed my endeavours to bring back to thy obedience this charming fugitiveMake her acknowlege her rashness repent her insults implore my forgiveness beg to be reinstated in my favour and that I will bury in oblivion the remembrance of her heinous offence against thee and against me thy faithful votary  THE chariot at the doorI come I come  I attend you good Captain  Indeed Sir  Pray SirCivility is not ceremony  And now dressed like a bridegroom my heart elated beyond that of the most desiring one attended by a footman whom my Beloved never saw I am already at Hampstead  END of  VOL IV    The Remainder of this
