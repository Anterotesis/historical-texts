 King  HENRY  the  VII OR  The  POPISH IMPOSTOR  A TRAGEDY  As it is acted  By his  MAJESTY's  Servants  AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN  DRURYLANE  LONDON  Printed for R FRANCKLIN in  CoventGarden  R DODSLEY in  PallMall  â–ª and J BROTHERTON in  Cornhill  MDCCXLVI Price is  d    PREFACE  THE following Piece was design'd as a Kind of Mirror to the present Rebellion and the imagined Advantage of having it acted before that unnatural Flame could be extinguish'd was the Reason why it was so hurry'd in the writing being begun and finish'd in less Time than is necessary tor the forming the Fable only of a correct Play It was the six Weeks Labour of an Actor who even in that short Space was often call'd from it by his Profession The Players for the Sake of Dispatch had it to study Act by Act just as it was blotted and the only Revisals it received from the  Brouillon  to the  Press  were at the Rehearsals of it So that we must bespeak the Reader's Indulgence for numberless Incorrections thro' the Whole but more particularly for the Measure and Diction the Author having neglected them so much that he cannot call the Manner in which it is written either Prose or Verse but accidentally both It is certain Apologies for bad writing seldom procure Remission from the Rigid yet the most flagrant Crimes when ingenuously confess'd and follow'd by Repentance admit of Extenuation from the Benevolent  N B  The Lines mark'd with Commas were omitted after the first Night's acting the Play being too long in the Performance  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr  MACKLIN  BReathes there a  Briton  longs for Popish Chains  While  Smithfield  Fire our  English  Annals Stains  When  Popish  Rage and Persecution blaz'd  With  British  Blood on Altars  Rome  had raised  When Matrons saw their Sons in Flames expire  Their Husbands crackling in religious Fire  Then  Rome  gave Laws our Kings and Council sway'd  While  Albion  mourn'd her Liberties betray'd  But now she smiles our Laws are all our own  Which rule alike the Cottage and the Throne  No Tools of Power our Properties invade  No Heads are chopt for Plots the Court hath made  By such base Arts her Empire  Rome  maintains  Axes her Arguments her Logic Chains  To these a Martyr gallant  Russel  fell  And  Sidney  bled whose Crime was writing well  But under  George  such Practice is unknown  For freeborn Subjects guard and grace his Throne  A Prince like him our Author shews to Night  Who fought for Freedom and his regal Right  The temporary Piece in Haste was writ  The six Weeks Labour of a puny Wit  With melting Measure Critic Rules unfraught  Artless he writesjust as rude Nature taught  No golden Lines no polish'd Verse hath he  But all like  British  Courage rough and free  For once then  Judge not by Critic but by patriot Laws  Where Genius fails support your fav'rite Cause  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs  WOFFINGTON  BY  Hal  deliver'd from my marriage Vows  Catherine  again is free to chuse a Spouse  The Man who offers fairest shall succeed  If  British  born or of old  Huntley's  Breed  Of  Rome  nursed Husbands I have had enough  O Ladies they are all such dastard Stuff  That I my self equip'd in Cap and Jerkin  Am every whit as good a Prince as  Perkin  'Tis true the Boy was loving soft and tender  But in the Main an arrant poor Pretender  Jesting apartnow Ladies what do you say  What is your Judgment of this hasty Play  For your Decision here the Author stands  Let the poor Rogue have Mercy at your Hands  In sooth we're much beholden to his Art  For in a female Form he hath placed a manly Heart  And if in her bright Character you find  Superior Spirit and a  Roman  Mind  Know from the Life her Principles he drew  And hopes the Piece shall live which copies you  Dramatis Personae  King HENRY  Mr  Delane  OXFORD

of Fate  A Nobleman who knew him when a Child  Avow'd him an Impostor born at  Tournay    The Son of one  John Osbec  not the Heir  Of  England's  Kingaudaciously assumed  This stagger'd many of the Court who warmly  Opposed his Audience I at length stood up  And in full Council strait produced our Letters  From  Charles  of  France  his Holiness the Pope  And  Maximilian  of  Bohemia    And as they all recognize his royal Birth  The Objection vanish'd and the King resolved  To give him instant Audience and support  Befitting regal State oppress'd and wrong'd  Frion  Most reverend Sir your Industry and Zeal  So warmly active in this pious Cause  Will ever make you dear to  France  and  Rome  Sevez  Frion  with religious Joy we will revenge  The irreverent Contempts lately offer'd  To our holy Church by unholy  England  My Functions secular and religious  Shall to their utmost stretch to fix this  Perkin  On  England's  Throne  Henry  hath refused  Our King by my Contrivance his Daughter  Margaret  which affront hath sown the Seeds  Of Hate too deep within his youthful Mind  Ever to be weeded out His Soul's on fire  And burns with Eagerness to pour Invasion  Into their haughty Land to loose at once  His unremitting Grudge on a proud Neighbour  And a dreaded Rival But  Frion  tho' we  Abound in  Scottish  Blood ready to be drain'd  Against  England's  Peace yet Treasure is War's  Strongest Sinew and without that quick'ning Aid  The devouring Body wastes to needy Peace  That must be had  Frion  Holy Sir 'tis ready  For Years large Collections have been making  In  England Spain  and everhelping  France    These Sums for the present are lodged with me  But now a special Order from his Holiness  Divests me of the Charge and to your Care  Commits the Trust  Sevez  Our unerring Father's Confidence  Does Honour to my Zeal I will bestow  The Treasure as his Holiness directs  And the religious Cause demands But how  Stands  Ireland  What Hopes from thence  Trion  None  Th' Apostate Slaves are fallen off from  Rome  And firmly fixt in the Usurper's Cause  Kildare Clanrikard  with many others  On whom we built absolute Assurance  Have at their own Charge arm'd their Friends 'and Followers  And join'd the  English  General  Poinings    For which may divine Vengeance taint their Air  And visit them to late Posterity  Sevez  How are the  English  affected towards us  Frion  As our Hearts could wish  Sir  Robert Clifford  and many others  All of high Rank and eminent Esteem  In Discontent at present with their King  By Gold and Promises have I firmly fixt  Yet more the Usurper's BosomFriend the Man  Nearest his Heart cross'd in ambitious Views  Has secretly vow'd Revenge and is ours  By Oath and Heart so that  England's  Measures  Are betray'd as soon as form'd  Sevez  So far then Probability attends us  And gives almost Assurance of Success  But one Thing moreIs  Perkin  well prepar'd  Can he affect the Blush of Innocence  Hath he the steadfast Eye that looks against  Enquiry Can he stand the Shock of gazing  Numbers And tell his Tale without Confusion  Is he Master of the false Tear and feigned Sigh  For to a crowded Presence he must speak  Frion  He is not to be taught his Lesson now  The blended Care of Nature and of Art  Have stamp'd him perfect a majestic Mein  A Countenance where Sweetness and Command  Smile awfully together a Deportment  Courtly but not effeminate a Skill  That calls him Master of most Languages  But chiefly  English  with a soothing Carriage  Which beggars the Persuasion of his Tongue  His suppos'd Aunt  Margaret of Burgundy  Has form'd his Education she has made him  A living History of  England's  Factions  The various Interests Battles Revolutions  The Friends the Enemies of either House  This of  Plantagenet  or that of  Lancaster  He is Master of many Languages  But chiefly  English  to ingratiate him  With the People and stamp him native  Sevez  The King is soft and warm susceptible of Pity  Prompt to receive th' Impression of Humanity  If  Perkin  do but tell his Tale with Skill  Th' unwary Youth will sympathize in Sorrow  And take and keep what Form his Art bestows  Frion  Doubt not his Art my Lord he is compleat  And often has rehears'd his kingly Part  In  France  in  Flanders  and in  Italy    Where admiring Crowds have wonder'd forth his Praise  And given natural Marks of Majesty  In Look Tone Gesture Gate and Voice  And credulous talebelieving Women  To whom Appearances are sacred Truths  Have at his welltold Tale dissolved in Tears  Thus my Lord like a graceful wellskill'd Actor  He steals where e'er he plays his princely Part  Or popular Applause or melting Pity  Sevez  Frion  some subtle Means must be contriv'd  To fling Division's Firebrands 'mongst the  English  For should they join their Hearts and Resolutions  The united Pow'r of  Europe  nay the World  Could not prevail against them  Frion  Care is taken  On every Side our Emissaries ply  And blacken the Usurper Gold and Prayer  Alternately are us'd and with Success  To bribe his Council and to win his Subjects  Richard  's divine hereditary Right  A Right Infallibility confirms  And which that Power makes indefeasible  Is preach'd amongst them strengthen'd by the 'Terror  Of Bulls Anathemas and Hell eternal  To those who disbelieve or disobey  Sevez  'Tis well But we must haste the King expects us  I'll conduct the Youth Is he ready  Frion  He is my Lord  Sevez  Frion  in your publick Manifestos  Be sure you promise free Power of Worship  To the  Lollards  and all Separatists  Men fight by Halves with a kind of bastard  Courage on Rebellion's Side without Religion  But when that's hook'd in why then Biggotry  Flaming Biggotry tunes Rebellion's Discord  Into pious Loyalty and makes Men fight  With hot enthusiastic Vigour  And forget the Name of Rebel For then  The Cause and Quarrel are no longer earthly  But derived of Heaven  Exeunt  SCENE II  King of  SCOTLAND PERKIN  Courtiers  c  K Scot  Cousin of  York England's  undoubted Prince  To our Court welcome Welcome to our Heart  Welcome to  Scotland's  dearest Blood and Treasure  Which in Support of thy undoubted Right  We promise to pour forth  Perkin  Gracious King  Godlike puissant and benificent  And still a Title far more glorious  Friend to Distress and Father to the Wretched  Prostrate before your royal Feet behold  A Prince whose Woes nor Time nor weeping Pity  With all the Store of Wretchedness they've seen  Can match a Prince sprung from the noblest Blood  That ever rul'd fair  Albion's  Seawash'd Isle  The high the regal oncebut now the outcast  Miserable forlorn  Plantagenet  O royal Sir Afflictions numberless  Have rooted in my Heart  Ev'n from our princely Cradle to our landing  On your hospitable Shore Fortune adverse  And cruel with her Whip of Thorns hath scourg'd us  Where e'er we went we've been pursued and dog'd  By wither'd Murder the pale Assassin  Of bloodthirsty Usurpation  K Scot  Rise royal Cousin most unhappy Youth  Sevez  takes him up  Perkin  My Uncle first unnatural crooked  Richard    Savage and bloodyby my dying Father  Appointed Guardian of the infant Lives  Of princely  Edward  and myself subborn'd  Two hellish Murderers at dead of Night  To plunge their Poignards in our guiltless Hearts  As we lay sleeping in our royal Tower  Edward  's rich Blood the Butchers soon let forth  His Skriek of Death awak'd mewhen Horror  Stiffening Horror seiz'd my frighted Soul  Close by my Side I saw my dying Brother  All weltring in his Gore Murder's butcher'd Prey  The grim Assassins  Their Hands yet reeking with the royal Blood  Seized meâ–ªshudderingI kneel'd and beg'd for Mercy  Instantly  As if great Providence had interposed  The MurderersSoulstruckstood ghast and flank  At length soft Mercy and relenting Nature  Warm'd about their Hearts and the uprais'd Hand  Unnerv'd by Pity the fatal Dagger dropt  Sevez  O heav'nly Care of injur'd Royalty  K Scot  We must be Marble not to melt at this  Perkin  The repenting Men  With Tears assur'd me of my Life and Safety  And straight returning to my cruel Uncle  Deceiv'd him with th' Account that both were dead  To  Tournay  thence with Speed I was convey'd  And there for some Time obscurely foster'd  Till at length  Margaret of Burgundy  My loving Aunt declar'd me  Edward  's Son  How I have since been toss'd by Fortune's Tempests  Is in the living Volume register'd  Of all Mens Tongues  K Scot  Cousin of  England  so I now proclaim you  In the full Presence of our Nobles here  Once more of Aid and Faithty'd Amity  We give thee royal and sincere Assurance  Sevez  give Order that throughout our Realm  He be acknowledged  England's  rightful King  With such Appointments and due Observance  As appertain to unquestion'd Majesty  And to stamp his Person still more sacred  Here in our Court shall be his Coronation  Sevez  set Preparation forward  Sevez  My Leige I will  K Scot  Say is our Council summon'd are they ready  Sevez  They are my gracious Prince  K Scot  And are the Lords  Of  Huntley Angus  and  Daliel  summon'd  Sevez  They are  K Scot  'Tis wellMy welcome Cozin be chearful  For some few Days what Pleasures can be found  In  Scotland's  Court we wish thee to partake  We'll after march to  England  and taste their's  Where we'll exchange the hospitable Word  Which now you wear and in my Turn I'll be  Your royal Guest and e'er 'tis long  We hope to dance a Measure in your Court  Exeunt all but  Sevez  and  Frion  Sevez  Thus far the Gale blows right and all goes well  But  Frion  we must leap another Bound  Another Danger still must be encounter'd  I must apprize thee that our  Scotch  Nobility  Proud and tenacious of their antient Rights  Vent daily murmurs and form close Cabals  Forsake the Court and bitterly inveigh  Against the Church as having usurp'd of late  Too much Authority in temporal Sway  Loud are their Complaints that by Priests and  Frenchmen  They are precluded from the Royal Ear  Some of these factious Spirits have been quell'd  Some of them banish'd and their Lands confiscate  Others imprison'd nay and some cut off  Yet still their dreaded Leaders do remain  Alexander Gordon  Earl of  Huntley  The young Lord  Daliel  And  Archibald Douglas  Earl of  Angus  Still they erect their Crests and with Impunity  Vent their black Malice 'gainst the Church and us  Frion  How have they scap'd  Sevez  Thro' Fear not Lenity  Their Friends are numerous their Possessions large  Their Deaths wou'd be Forerunners of our Ruin  Else let me speak it like a true  Romish  ChurchMan  Their irksome Beings had not now perplex'd us  They have absented long from Court and Council  But late a special Summons from the King  Has order'd their Attendance here to Day  On Pain of Banishment and Confiscation  Fri  But holy Sir I doubt these headstrong Lords  Will not assent to aid our  Perkin  's Claim  Sevez  No Matter  Frion  we can do without them  For me I'm determin'd and for the King  He acts by my controuling Will not his own  It is not prudent that the Church of  Rome  Should e're let Kings or Rulers think for themselves  Th' unerring See should ever be their Guide  As to those heretic Lords their Assent  For  Perkin  is our least Concern We have  More important Views upon themDeath Death  Frion Huntley  must not live he stalks and roars  But one Day more in Freedom's spacious Forest  The Toil is set for th' unwily Lion  And his own boundless Spirit drives him in  He thinks the King mislead and will bellow  Without Guile or Guard for the Fool is brave  Ev'n to romantick Madness '  Scotland  's Good  'So strongly burns within him it appears  'His only Passion Freedom is his God  Which he so idolizes he would make  The World his Proselytes did they but hear him  Frion  Lord  Sevez  'tis not fit such Men exist  Sevez  O they are dangerous in a Court like ours  Where the King's Interest wanders from the Peoples  But his Majesty's prepar'dand resolved  This Day by my Advice to silence  Huntley  's  Free speaking or his Head answer th' Default  Frion  Omniscient Wisdom still directs your Mind  And points your Purpose to some holy End  But my right reverend Sir one thing remains  Unsettled yet which only you can finish  You know this  Perkin  burns for  Huntley  's Daughter  Scotland  's gay Ornament and Nature's Pride  This Angellooking Maid this  Katherine Gordon  To young Lord  Daliel  has been late betroth'd  The Follower and fervent Friend of  Huntley    Your Wonderworking Wisdom now must break  This fatal Knot or  England  's blazing Crown  Will sit like Death upon his princely Head  Sevez  This Business in the Council has been weigh'd  The King resolves to gratify his Wish  And give the lovely  Katherine  to young  Perkin  Which Match will either fix this dangerous  Huntley  in our Cause or with enraged Madness  Break his proud stubborn Heart For his Daughter  Next to Liberty is his earthly Idol  But I must leave youfor the Council sits  To found those factious LordsI must attend  Exit  Frion  My Brother Priest is zealous in our Cause  His Pride and Avarice must be the Tools  With which we workThey are sharp and handy  And in a Priest who sways the royal Mind  Will rid much Business  Gordon  's lovely Daughter  Who is of royal Blood to  Perkin  join'd  Will knit the Scots to us indissolubly  For after Marriage should they find the Cheat  'Twill then become their Interest to conceal it  Nay to espouse it tooWhich if they do refuse  The Magazines of  Rome  's affrighting Vengeance  In damning Bulls and terrible Anathemas  Shall to the liquid Gulph of penal Flames  Devote their black their superstitious Souls  Till Penitence and Gold buy out their Pardon  Exit  SCENE III  The CouncilChamber  The King  SEVEZ  Sir  DAVID BRUCE Council and Attendants  King  How not attend  Angus  and  Daliel  ill  Sev  So their Oracle Lord

returns with  Huntley  Lord  Huntley  welcome to the royal Walls  Of  Holyrood  and well we wish you never  Had estranged them It would have joy'd us much  To've seen the Lords  Daliel  and  Angus  here  As you are Subjects Nobles and Kinsmen  We with your Love and we intreat all Lets  That may impede our Concord be remov'd  Your Presence will be Gladness to our Heart  Therefore be oftener in our Eye  Huntley  My Leige I am unfashion'd for your Court  My Speech like my Manners are plain and uncourtly  I have been bred a Soldier a  Scotch  Soldier  Not an  Italian  Flatterer My old Body  Is dry'd and chill'd with toilsome Marches thro'  Numbing Frost and scorching Heat to grapple with  My Country's Foe  I have not been used to silken Coverli Is  And  Solon  Bedsbut to the friendly Plaid  And swampy Earth and my best Lodging oft  Hath been the dryest Turf the blooming Hether  The wholesome Fern Our unletter'd Bards then  Flatter'd not the Living but prais'd the Dead  Their Songs were not who steep'd deepest in  Italian  Luxury or deck'd gayest in foreign Frippery  But who had most Wounds in Battle or fought  Hardiest in their Country's Cause This Court  Was not then the Rendezvous of  Italian  Minstrels  Priests and Legatesbut the hospitable Home  Of  Scotch  Nobility whose Ancestors  This Realm coeval'd and when grown strengthless  By fighting  Scotland's  Battles grew venerably grey  In her faithful CouncilsWhere are they now  Here are none such Your Nobles are Strangers  To your Court your Courtiers Strangers to your Nobles  K Scot  Huntley  to taunt and to revile  Was not the Purport of our Summons but  To counsel and assist  Huntley  Sir Counsel void of Freedom  May flatter and mislead but never can assist  Freedom is the Guide the unerring Guide  To sacred Truth in a Nation's Council  The  freeborn  Subject's indisputable Right  And never suffer'd Prohibition yet  But from Priests and Tyrants  K Scot  Sir to your vast  Hightaught Notions of Freedom we are no  Stranger Rabble  Kerns  too we hear copy your  Licentious Knowledge and in rude saucy  Language dare revile our sacred Person  Libellously branding our Wisdom with  French  and Priestrid Weakness  Huntley  My Leige when the Yoke galls  Nature will wince Arrests Imprisonments  And Confiscations compose your Subjects Dreams  And break their restless Sleep We lie down  With Anguish at our Stateand rise despairing  Ever to see it mend and the Heartstinging  Prospect that opens to our View is  Posterity scourged by  French  and  Romish  Tyranny  K Scot  O Sir your distemper'd Fancy frames  Sprites and Goblins Men of sounder Judgments never see  Huntley  Pray Heaven it may be Fancy  My Liege I have fought my Country's Battles  In Sweat and Blood when every Object  To Eye and Ear and Thought brought certain Death  Into the Mind the whole a moving Scene  Of busy Fate And after Battle I have  Seen the hardfought conquer'd Field strew'd with Death  And Slaughter There I've beheld our gallant  Helpless Nobles breathing out final Groans  Their active Blood baked and clotted  By scorching Heat or swallow'd by the greedy  Suncrack'd Earth There I beheld Brothers and  Kinsmen stript and piled on mangled Heaps  Of Slaughter  Kerns  and  Thanes  promiscuous  There searching for my dear my darling only Son  I found his wellknown headless Trunk all gash'd  And mangledwith his Brains dash'd and scatter'd  'Gainst a bloodstain'd OakYet these were Sights of Joy  To what I now behold  I see my Country bleeding in her vital Vein  I see her Nobles banish'd imprison'd and assassin'd  I see  Scotland's  Dregs compose her Councils  All Concerns sacred civil and military  Sold and huckster'd as in a publick Mart  I see Majestydeluded Majesty  Hem'd in by a Band of crawling Parasites  Who taint his royal Mind with a King's bluest Plague  Seditious Jealousie of his best Subjects  O awake awake anointed Sir and  Be the Father not the Tyrant of your People  Ferret from your Court these Rats who'll undermine  The Roof that shelters them and leave your Fame  And Country to perish in the Ruins  Sevez  Lord  Huntley  your illmanner'd Heat of Temper  Makes you forget the Presence you are in  The Homage and Respect due to Majesty  You wilfully and audaciously omit  Hunt  The Homage and Respect the envenom'd slander  And the telltale Pickthanks you mean my Lord  Which taint the purest Loyalty to blackest Treason  Sevez  My Lord your Manners grow foul and beneath your Rank  Hunt  My Priest your Pride grows insolent  And above your Rank and the same Recipe  That discharges the black Stains from your Conscience  Will cleanse my Manners  Sevez  Stains from my Conscience Lord  Hunt  Ay Priest 'twas my Phrase  Sevez  My Leige this Treatment  In your royal Presence too is beyond  The Sufferance of wholesome Policy  And human Natureit demands instant  Chastisement  Hunt  Chastisement Priest  Sevez  Ay Chastisement Lord  K Scot    Huntley  be calm Why how now Sir  Have you forgot our Presence  Hunt  No my Lord  Rows to to the King then with a stifled Rage turns to  Sevez  You are a Priestin Councilbut no matter  'Tis well  O  Scotland Scotland  how is thy Spirit broke  When that a  Kern  bred upstart  Rome  taught Priest  Dares hold a Rod of menaced Chastisement  Over the Minds of freeborn Peers  K Scot  Huntley  you grow seditious  Hunt  My Liege Truth will ever be Sedition  While  France  and  Italy  direct your Council  K Scot  Sir my Allies of  France  and holy  Rome  Must not be revil'd by you or any  Slanderspreading Subject within my Realm  Sevez  Pray my good Lord if Heart will give you Leave  Will you inform his Majesty and Council  In what this outstretch'd Power of  Rome  consists  K Scot  Ay  Huntley  let us cooly hear at once  These arbitrary and oppressive Grievances  In Church and State and if they appear such  Our royal Word is 'gaged for the Redress  Hunt  Ay Sir now you speak like a King  Whose noblest Office is to hear and to redress  K Scot  Proceed Sir in your Grievances you have free Leave  Hunt  Most heartily I thank your Majesty  Your gracious Boon I will accept  And in my homely Plainness dreadless use it  Tho' I were sure this Freedom were my last  To begin then  Freespeaking Parliaments are thrown aside  As superfluous in our State and prostitute  Bulls from marketing  Rome  supply their Place  The regal Council of the Realm consists  First of  William Sevez  now the Pope's Legate  A Man issued from the base perfidious Clan  Of vile  Mackgreger  He with religious Guile  And Gallic Craft infacinates the royal Mind  The Subject's Lives their Rights and Properties  He grinds and arbitrates with tyrant Will  And to pleasure subtle  France  misguides our Land  To a perfidious War in support  Of an Impostor's Title against our  True Allies the Faithobserving English  Sevez  Dread Sir this Insult to distress'd Royalty  Is not to be borne  King Scot  Let him proceed  'Tis the last Time he speaks in  Scotish  Council  Hunt  Be it so my Liege Then 'tis the last Service  I shall do my Country But to your Council  Since it is my last Right against your Priest  An English Minstrel

utmost Shock  And in a Father  Huntley  Hold  Katherine  mistake not it is not Death  But Guilt Guilt my Child is Nature's utmost Shock  To the Innocent Death is a Guide to Life eternal  But to the Guilty a ghastly Summoner  Which frights and goads and stings to endless Tortures  Death 'tis Nature's Companion  He attends every Action of our Lives  I have seen the barerib'd Tyrant in as  Many Forms as there were armed Soldiers  In the Field sometimes darting from Man to Man  Levelling Ranks and sweeping down armed Files  While brazen Engines his iron Messengers  Sent forth and with a Loudness that deafen'd  Nature proclaim'd his Triumph and can I  After this fear his Block and Ax no Child  Only the Traitor starts at those th' Patriot  Beholds them with a Fortitude that smiles  And

Court Creature to do filthy Jobs  As Priests and  Rome  direct to bow defame  And fawn and cringe and beg to be employ'd  In some brave Man's Destruction To flatter  A prideswoln Priest and pamper up  His Avarice and Revenge with my Country's Ruin  Is this a Life for  Huntley  No  I know you will not council it  Well upon what Terms will our royal Master  Give us Leave to breathe  Kath  Know thenO

Kath  O my foreboding Heart 'twas what I fear'd  To herself  Hunt  But  Katherine  lest you shou'd mistake and  Err into Infamy know that your mangled  Body in Death wou'd give me Joy  When your lovely blooming Person in such  A prostituted Marriage wou'd bring cureless  Sorrowit wou'd rive my old Heart in twain  My Child farewel  embraces her  when you  Have better Thoughts  Bring them to

dogging  My Father's Stepsand softly stealing with  His shadowy Arm uprais'd ready to aim  His final Dart  O some unerring Power direct me  If I wander into Error the Crime  Is not in my Will but my Ignorance  For I find filial Gratitude and partial  Nature struggling at my Heart and prompting  That I must not let Him dye who gave me Life  I find Love too pleading for my  Daliel    Sure all this must be right or Heaven would not  Permit itNo they shall not dye  My Father is cruel to himself and me  And Nature sympathizing Nature  Will be obey'd and they must live  For on their Lives alone

made a King The People's Interest  In a free Nation is blended and coequal  With the King's and he who separates or  Overvalues either is the Traitor  Not we who want to unite and poise them  K Scot  Sir this is a Language I'm unus'd to  Hunt  I know it is young King therefore I speak it  For when Tyrant Folly surrounds the Throne  The Truth to our King is the Nation's best  Loyalty Look into our honest Neighbour's  The  English  Annals see their Insolence  In Defence of Liberty encroach'd by  Rome  directed Kings See their determin'd  Honest Souls wading thro' mercenary  Slavish Blood to

Effusion And that on such Terms  As befits  Scotland's  Honour to accept  England's  to offer  K Scot  Lord Prelate  England  Cannot be more in love with Amity  Than  Scotland  is But the Insults
