 With a coat of five capes that quite covers my back  And my wife keeps a sausageshop not many miles  From the narrowest alley in all Broad St Giles  Tho' poor we are honest and very content  We pay as we go for meat drink and for rent  To work all the week I am able and willing  I never get drunk and I waste not a shilling  III  What tho' at a tavern my gentleman tarries  Why the coachman grows richer than he whom he carries  And I'd rather say I since it saves me from sin  Be the Driver without than the Toper within  IV  For the dramshop I hate and the dramdrinking friend  Yet I'm not quite so good but I wish I may mend  I repent of my sins since we all are deprav'd  For a Coachman I hold has a soul to be sav'd  V  When a riotous multitude fills up a street  And the greater part know not boys wherefore they meet  If I see there is mischief I never go there  Let others get tipsy so I get my fare  VI  Now to church if I take some good lady to pray  It grieves me full sore to be kept quite away  So I step thro' the doorway for here 'tis the sin  To loiter without when one might enter in  VII  Then my glasses are whole and my coach is so neat  I am always the first to be call'd in the street  And I'm known by the name 'tis a name rather rare  Of the Coachman that never asks more than his fare  VIII  Tho' my beasts should be dull yet I don't use them ill  Tho' they stumble I swear not nor cut them up hill  For I firmly believe there's no charm in an oath  That can make a Nag trot when to walk he is loth  IX  And tho' I'm a Coachman I'll freely confess  I beg of my Maker my labors to bless  I praise him each morning and pray every night  And 'tis this makes my heart feel so cheerful and light  X  When I drive to a Fun'ral I care not for drink  That is not the moment to guzzle but think  And I wish I cou'd add both of Coachman and Master  That both of us strove to amend a bit faster  Z  THE END  This Day are PUBLISHED  Price d Â½ each or s d per for s d for s d
