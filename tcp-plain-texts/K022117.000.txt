 ESSAYS MORAL AND POLITICAL  Tros Rutulusve  fuat nullo discrimine habebo  VIRG  EDINBURGH  Printed by R FLEMING and A ALISON for A KINCAID Bookseller and Sold at his Shop above the Cross MDCCXLI  Advertisement  MOST of these ESSAYS were wrote with a View of being publish'd as WEEKLYPAPERS and were intended to comprehend the Designs both of the SPECTATORS and CRAFTSMEN But having dropt that Undertaking partly from LAZINESS partly from WANT of LEISURE and being willing to make Trial of my Talents for Writing before I ventur'd upon any more serious Compositions I was induced to commit these Trifles to the  Judgment of the Public Like most new Authors I must confess I feel some Anxiety concerning the Success of my Work But one Thing makes me more secure That the READER may condemn my Abilities but must approve of my Moderation and Impartiality in my Method of handling POLITICAL SUBJECTS And as long as my Moral Character is in Safety I can with less Anxiety abandon my Learning and Capacity to the most severe Censure and Examination Public Spirit methinks shou'd engage us to love the Public and to bear an equal Affection to all our CountryMen not to hate one Half of them under Pretext of loving the Whole  This PARTYRAGE I have endeavour'd to repress as far as possible and I hope this Design will be acceptable to the moderate of both Parties at the same Time that perhaps it may displease the Bigots of both  THE READER must not look for any Connexion among these ESSAYS but must consider each of them as a Work apart This is an Indulgence that is given to all ESSAYWRITERS and is an equal Ease both to WRITER and READER by freeing them from any tiresome Stretch of Attention or Application  CONTENTS  Essay  I Of the Delicacy of Taste and Passion  Page    II

to which some People are subject that makes them extremely sensible to all the Accidents of Life and gives them a lively Joy upon every prosperous Event as well as a piercing Grief when they meet with Crosses and Adversity Favours and Goodoffices easily engage their Friendship while the smallest Injury provokes their Resentment Any Honour or Mark of Distinction elevates them above Measure but they are as sensibly touch'd with Contempt People of this Character have no doubt much more lively Enjoyments as well as more pungent Sorrows than Men of  more cool and sedate Tempers But I believe when every Thing is balanc'd there is no one that wou'd not rather chuse to be of the latter Character were he entirely Master of his own Disposition Good or ill Fortune is very little at our own Disposal And when a Person that has this Sensibility of Temper meets with any Misfortune his Sorrow or Resentment takes intire Possession of him and deprives him of all Relish in the common Occurrences of Life the right Enjoyment of which forms the greatest Part of our Happiness Great Pleasures are much less frequent than great Pains so that a sensible Temper must meet with fewer Trials in the former Way than in the latter Not to mention that Men of such lively passions are apt to be transported beyond all Bounds of Prudence and Discretion and take false Steps in the Conduct of Life which are often irretrievable  THERE is a  Delicacy  of  Taste  observable in some Men which very much resembles this  Delicacy  of  Passion  and produces the same Sensibility to Beauty and Deformity of every Kind as that does to Prosperity and Adversity Obligations and Injuries When you  present a Poem or a Picture to a Man possest of this Talent the Delicacy of his Feeling or Sentiments makes him be touched very sensibly by every Part of it nor are the masterly Strokes perceived with a more exquisite Relish and Satisfaction than the Negligences or Absurdities with Disgust and Uneasiness A polite and judicious Conversation affords him the highest Entertainment Rudeness or Impertinence is as great a Punishment to him In short Delicacy of Taste has the same Effect as Delicacy of Passion It enlarges the Sphere both of our Happiness and Misery and makes us sensible of Pains as well as Pleasures that escape the rest of Mankind  I BELIEVE however there is no one who will not agree with me that notwithstanding this Resemblance a Delicacy of Taste is as much to be desir'd and cultivated as a Delicacy of Passion is to be lamented and to be remedied if possible The good or ill Accidents of Life are very little at our Disposal But we are pretty much Masters what Books we shall read what Diversions we shall partake of and what Company we shall keep The ancient Philosophers endeavour'd to render  Happiness intirely independent of every Thing external That is impossible to be  attain'd  But every wise Man will endeavour to place his Happiness on such Objects as depend most upon himself And  that  is not to be  attain'd  so much by any other Means as by this Delicacy of Sentiment When a Man is possest of that Talent he is more happy by what pleases his Taste than by what gratifies his Appetites and receives more Enjoyment from a Poem or a Piece of Reasoning than the most expensive Luxury can afford  HOW far the Delicacy of Taste and that of Passion are connected together in the original Frame of the Mind it is hard to determine To me there appears to be a very considerable Connexion betwixt them For we may observe that Women who have more delicate Passions than Men have also a more delicate Taste of the Ornaments of Life of Dress Equipage and the ordinary Decencies of Behaviour Any Excellency in these hits their Taste much sooner than Ours and when you please their Taste you soon engage their Affections  BUT whatever Connexion there may be originally betwixt these Dispositions I am persuaded that nothing is so proper to cure us of this Delicacy of Passion as the cultivating of that higher and more refined Taste which enables us to judge of the Characters of Men of Compositions of Genius and of the Productions of the nobler Arts A greater or less Relish of those obvious Beauties that strike the Senses depends intirely upon the greater or less Sensibility of the Temper But with regard to the Liberal Arts a fine Taste is really nothing but strong Sense or at least depends so much upon it that they are inseparable To judge aright of a Composition of Genius there are so many Views to be taken in so many Circumstances to be compared and such a Knowledge of human Nature requisite that no Man who is not possest of the soundest Judgment will ever make a tolerable Critic in such Performances And this is a new Reason for cultivating a Relish in the Liberal Arts Our Judgment will strengthen by this Exercise We shall form truer Notions of Life Many Things which rejoice or afflict others will appear to us too frivolous to engage our Attention And we  shall lose by Degrees that Sensibility and Delicacy of Passion which is so incommodious  BUT perhaps I have gone too far in saying that a cultivated Taste for the Liberal Arts extinguishes the Passions and renders us indifferent to those Objects which are so fondly pursued by the rest of Mankind When I reflect a little more I find that it rather improves our Sensibility for all the tender and agreeable Passions at the same Time that it renders the Mind incapable of the rougher and more boist'rous Emotions  Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes  Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros  FOR this I think there may be assigned two very natural Reasons In the  first  Place nothing is so improving to the Temper as the Study of the Beauties either of Poetry Eloquence Musick or Painting They give a certain Elegance of Sentiment which the rest of Mankind are intire Strangers to The Emotions they excite are soft and tender They draw the Mind off from the Hurry of Business and Interest cherish Reflection dispose to Tranquility and produce an agreeable Melancholy  which of all Dispositions of the Mind is the best suited to Love and Friendship  IN the  second  Place a Delicacy of Taste is favourable to Love and Friendship by consining our Choice to few People and making us indifferent to the Company and Conversation of the greatest Part of Men You will very seldom find that mere Men of the World whatever strong Sense they may be endowed with are very nice in distinguishing of Characters or in marking those insensible Differences and Gradations which make one Man preferable to another Any one that has competent Sense is sufficient for their Entertainment They talk to him of their Pleasures and Affairs with the same Frankness as they would to any other And finding many that are fit to supply his Place they never feel any Vacancy or Want in his Absence But to make use of the Allusion of a famous  Mons  Fontenelle  Pluralit√© des Mondes  Soir    French  Author The Judgment may be compared to a Clock or Watch where the most ordinary Machine is sufficient to tell the Hours but  the most elaborate and artificial only can point out the Minutes and Seconds and distinguish the smallest Differences of Time One that has well digested his Knowledge both of Books and Men has little Enjoyment but in the Company of a few select Companions He feels too sensibly how much all the rest of Mankind falls short of the Notions he has entertained And his Affections being thus confined in a narrow Circle no Wonder he carries them further than if they were more general and undistinguished The Gaiety and Frolick of a BottleCompanion improves with him into a solid Friendship And the Ardours of a youthful Appetite become an elegant Passion  ESSAY II Of the LIBERTY of the PRESS  THERE is nothing more apt to surprise a Foreigner than the extreme Liberty we enjoy in this Country of communicating whatever we please to the Publick and of openly censuring every Measure which is enter'd into by the King or his Ministers If the Administration resolve upon War 'tis affirm'd that either wilfully or ignorantly they mistake the Interest of the Nation and that Peace in the present Situation of Affairs is infinitely preferable If the Passion of the Ministers be for Peace our Political Writers breathe nothing but War and Devastation and represent the pacifick Conduct of the Government as mean and pusillanimous As this Liberty is not indulg'd in any other Government either Republican  or Monarchical in  Holland  and  Venice  no more than in  France  or  Spain  it may very naturally give Occasion to these two Questions  How it happens that  Great Britain  enjoys such a peculiar Privilege  and  Whether the unlimited Exercise of this Liberty be advantageous or prejudicial to the Publick  AS to the  first  Question Why the Laws indulge us in such an extraordinary Liberty I believe the Reason may be deriv'd from our mixt Form of Government which is neither wholly Monarchical nor wholly Republican 'Twill be found if I mistake not to be a true Observation in Politicks That the two Extremes in Government of Liberty and Slavery approach nearest to each other and that as you depart from the Extremes and mix a little of Monarchy with Liberty the Government becomes always the more free and on the other Hand when you mix a little of Liberty with Monarchy the Yoke becomes always the more grievous and intolerable In a Government such as that of  France  which is entirely absolute and where Laws Custom and Religion all concur to make the People fully satisfi'd with their Condition the  Monarch cannot entertain the least  Jealousy  against his Subjects and therefore is apt to indulge them in great  Liberties  both of Speech and Action In a Government altogether Republican such as  Holland  where there is no Magistrate so eminent as to give  Jealousy  to the State there is also no Danger in intrusting the Magistrates with very large discretionary Powers and tho' many Advantages result from such Powers in the Preservation of Peace and Order yet they lay a considerable Restraint on Mens Actions and make every private Subject pay a great Respect to the Government Thus it is evident that the two Extremes of absolute Monarchy and of a Republic approach very near to each other in the most material Circumstances In the  first  the Magistrate has no Jealousy of the People In the  second  the People have no Jealousy of the Magistrate Which want of Jealousy begets a mutual Confidence and Trust in both Cases and produces a Species of Liberty in Monarchies and of arbitrary Power in Republics  To justify the other Part of the foregoing Proposition that in every Government the  Means are most wide of each other and that the Mixtures of Monarchy and Liberty render the Yoke either more easy or more grievous I must take Notice of a Remark of  Tacitus  with regard to the  Romans  under their Emperors that they neither could bear total Slavery nor total Liberty  Nec totam servitutem nec totam libertatem pati possunt  This Remark a famous Poet has translated and applied to the  English  in his admirable Description of Queen  Elizabeth  's Policy and happy Government  Et fit aimer son joug a l'Anglois indompt√©  Qui ne peut ni servir ni vivre en libert√©  HENRIADE  Liv    ACCORDING to these Remarks therefore we are to consider the  Roman  Government as a Mixture of Despotism and Liberty where the Despotism prevailed and the  English  Government as a Mixture of the same Kind but where the Liberty predominates The Consequences are exactly conformable to the foregoing Observation and such as may be expected from those mixed Forms of Government which beget a mutual Watchfulness and Jealousy The  Roman  Emperors were many  of them the most frightful Tyrants that ever disgraced Humanity and 'tis evident their Cruelty was chiefly excited by their  Jealousy  and by their observing that all the great Men of  Rome  bore with Impatience the Dominion of a Family which but a little before was nowise superior to their own On the other Hand as the Republican Part of the Government prevails in  England  tho' with a great Mixture of Monarchy 'tis obliged for its own Preservation to maintain a watchful  Jealousy  over the Magistrates to remove all discretionary Powers and to secure every one's Life and Fortune by general and inflexible Laws No Action must be deemed a Crime but what the Law has plainly determined to be such No Crime must be imputed to a Man but from a legal Proof before his Judges And even these Judges must be his Fellowsubjects who are obliged by their own Interest to have a watchful Eye over the Encroachments and Violence of the Ministers From these Causes it proceeds that there is as much Liberty and even perhaps Licence in  Britain  as there was formerly Slavery and Tyranny in  Rome  THESE Principles account for the great Liberty of the Press in these Kingdoms beyond what is indulg'd in any other Government 'Tis sufficiently known that despotic Power wou'd soon steal in upon us were we not extreme watchful to prevent its Progress and were there not an easy Method of conveying the Alarum from one End of the Kingdom to the other The Spirit of the People must frequently be rouz'd to curb the Ambition of the Court and the Dread of rouzing this Spirit must be employ'd to prevent that Ambition Nothing is so effectual to this Purpose as the Liberty of the Press by which all the Learning Wit and Genius of the Nation may be employ'd on the Side of Liberty and every one be animated to its Defence As long therefore as the Republican Part of our Government can maintain itself against the Monarchical it must be extreme jealous of the Liberty of the Press as of the utmost Importance to its Preservation  SINCE therefore the Liberty of the Press is so essential to the Support of our mixt Government this sufficiently decides the second Question  Whether this Liberty be advantageous  or prejudicial  there being nothing of greater Importance in every State than the Preservation of the ancient Government especially if it be a free one But I wou'd fain go a Step farther and assert that such a Liberty is attended with so few Inconveniencies that it may be claim'd as the common Right of Mankind and ought to be indulg'd them almost in every Government except the Ecclesiastical to which indeed it wou'd be fatal We need not dread from this Liberty any such ill Consequences as follow'd from the Harangues of the popular Demagogues of  Athens  and Tribunes of  Rome  A Man reads a Book or Pamphlet alone and coolly There is none prefent from whom he can catch the Passion by Contagion He is not hurry'd away by the Force and Energy of Action And shou'd he be wrought up to never so seditious a Humour there is no violent Resolution presented to him by which he can immediately vent his Passion The Liberty of the Press therefore however abus'd can scarce ever excite popular Tumults or Rebellion And as to those Murmurs or secret Discontents it may occasion 'tis better they shou'd get Vent in Words that they may come to the Knowledge  of the Magistrate before it be too late in order to his providing a Remedy against them Mankind 'tis true have always a greater Propension to believe what is said to the Disadvantage of their Governors than the contrary but this Inclination is inseparable from them whether they have Liberty or not A Whisper may fly as quick and be as pernicious as a Pamphlet Nay it will be more pernicious where Men are not accustom'd to think freely or distinguish betwixt Truth and Falshood  IT has also been found as the Experience of Mankind increases that the  People  are no such dangerous Monster as they have been represented and that 'tis in every Respect better to guide them like rational Creatures than to lead or drive them like brute Beasts Before the united Provinces set the Example Toleration was deem'd incompatible with good Government and 'twas thought impossible that a Number of religious Sects cou'd live together in Harmony and Peace and have all of them an equal Affection to their common Country and to each other  England  has set a like Example of civil Liberty and tho' this  Liberty seems to occasion some mall Ferment at present it has not as yet produced any pernicious Effects and it is to be hoped that Men being every Day more accustomed to the free Discussion of public Affairs will improve in their Judgment of them and be with greater Difficulty seduced by every idle Rumor and popular Clamour  'TIS a very comfortable Reflection to the Lovers of Liberty that this peculiar Privilege of  Britain  is of a Kind that cannot easily be wrested from us and must last as long as our Government remains in any Degree free and independent 'Tis seldom that Liberty of any Kind is lost all at once Slavery has so frightful an Aspect to Men accustom'd to Freedom that it must steal in upon them by Degrees and must disguise itself in a thousand Shapes in ordet to be received But if the Liberty of the Press ever be lost it must be lost at once The general Laws against Sedition and Libelling are at present as strong as they possibly can be made Nothing can impose a farther Restraint but either the clapping an IMPRIMATUR upon the Press or the giving very large discretionary Powers to the  Court to punish whatever displeases them But these Concessions would be such a barefac'd Violation of Liberty that they will probably be the last Efforts of a despotic Government We may conclude that the Liberty of  Britain  is gone for ever when these Attempts shall succeed  ESSAY III Of IMPUDENCE and MODESTY  I HAVE always been of Opinion that the Complaints against Providence have been illgrounded and that the good or bad Qualities of Men are the Causes of their good or bad Fortune more than what is generally imagined There are no doubt Instances to the contrary and pretty numerous ones too but few in Comparison of the Instances we have of a right Distribution of Prosperity and Adversity Nor indeed could it be otherwise from the common Course of human Affairs To be endowed with a benevolent Disposition and to love others will almost infallibly procure Love and Esteem which is the chief Circumstance in Life and facilitates every Enterprize and Undertaking besides the Satisfaction which immediately  results from it The Case is much the same with the other Virtues Prosperity is naturally tho' not necessarily attached to Virtue and Merit as Adversity is to Vice and Folly  I MUST however confess that this Rule admits of an Exception with regard to one moral Quality and that  Modesty  has a natural Tendency to conceal a Man's Talents as  Impudence  displays them to the utmost and has been the only Cause why many have risen in the World under all the Disadvantages of low Birth and little Merit Such Indolence and Incapacity is there in the Generality of Mankind that they are apt to receive a Man for whatever he has a Mind to put himself off for and admits his overbearing Airs as Proofs of that Merit which he assumes to himself A decent Assurance seems to be the natural Attendant of Virtue and few Men can distinguish Impudence from it As on the other Hand Diffidence being the natural Result of Vice and Folly has drawn Disgrace upon Modesty which in outward Appearance so nearly resembles it  I WAS lately lamenting to a Friend of mine who loves a Conceit that popular Applause should be bestowed with so little Judgment and that so many empty forward Coxcombs should rise up to a Figure in the World Upon which he said there was nothing surprising in the Case  Popular Fame  says he  is nothing but Breath or Air and Air very naturally presses into a Vacuum  As Impudence tho' really a Vice has the same Effects upon a Man's Fortune as if it were a Virtue so it is remarkable that it is almost as difficult to be attain'd and is in that respect distinguish'd from all the other Vices which are acquired with little Pains and continually encrease upon Indulgence Many a Man being sensible that Modesty is extremely prejudicial to him in the making his Fortune has resolved to be impudent and to put a bold Face upon the Matter But 'tis observable that such People have seldom succeeded in the Attempt but have been obliged to relapse into their primitive Modesty Nothing carries a Man thro' the World like a true genuine natural Impudence Its Counterfeit is good for nothing nor can ever support itself In any  other Attempt whatever Faults a Man commits and is sensible of he is so much the nearer his End But when he endeavours at Impudence if he ever fail'd in the Attempt the Remembrance of it will make him blush and will infallibly disconcert him After which every Blush is a Cause for new Blushes 'till he be found out to be an arrant Cheat and a vain Pretender to Impudence  IF any thing can give a modest Man more Assurance it must be some Advantages of Fortune which Chance procures to him Riches naturally gain a Man a favourable Reception in the World and give Merit a double Lustre when a Person is endowed with it and supply its Place in a great Measure when it is absent 'Tis wonderful to observe what Airs of Superiority Fools and Knaves with large Possessions give themselves above Men of the greatest Merit in Poverty Nor do the Men of Merit make any strong Opposition to these Usurpations or rather seem to favour them by the Modesty of their Behaviour Their Good Sense and Experience make them diffident of their Judgment and cause them to examine every thing with the greatest Accuracy As  on the other Hand the Delicacy of their Sentiments makes them timorous lest they commit Faults and lose in the Practice of the World that Integrity of Virtue of which they are so jealous To make Wisdom agree with Confidence is as difficult as to reconcile Vice to Modesty  THESE are the Reflections that have occur'd to me upon this Subject of Impudence and Modesty and I hope the Reader will not be displeased to see them wrought into the following Allegory  JUPITER in the Beginning joined VIRTUE WISDOM and CONFIDENCE together and VICE FOLLY and DIFFIDENCE And in that Society set them upon the Earth But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment and said that  Confidence  was the natural Companion of  Virtue  and that  Vice  deserved to be attended with  Diffidence  they had not gone far before Dissension arose among them  Wisdom  who was the Guide of the one Company was always accustomed before she ventured upon any Road however beaten to examine it carefully  to enquire whither it led what Dangers Difficulties and Hindrances might possibly or probably occur in it In these Deliberations she usually consum'd some Time which Delay was very displeasing to  Confidence  who was always inclin'd to hurry on without much Forethought or Deliberation in the first Road he met  Wisdom  and  Virtue  were inseparable But  Confidence  one Day following his impetuous Nature advanc'd a considerable Way before his Guides and Companions and not feeling any Want of their Company he never enquir'd after them nor ever met with them more In like Manner the other Society tho' join'd by  Jupiter  disagreed and separated As  Folly  saw very little Way before her she had nothing to determine concerning the Goodness of Roads nor cou'd give the Preference to one above another and this Want of Resolution was encreas'd by  Diffidence  who with her Doubts and Scruples always retarded the Journey This was a great Annoyance to  Vice  who lov'd not to hear of Difficulties and Delays and was never satisfy'd without his full Career in whatever his Inclinations led him to  Folly  he knew tho' she hearken'd to  Diffidence  wou'd be easily manag'd when alone  and therefore as a vicious Horse throws his Rider he openly beat away this Controller of all his Pleasures and proceeded in his Journey with  Folly  from whom he is inseparable  Confidence  and  Diffidence  being after this Manner both thrown loose from their respective Companies wander'd for some Time till at last Chance led them at the same Time to one Village  Confidence  went directly up to the great House which belong'd to WEALTH the Lord of the Village and without staying for a Porter intruded himself immediately into the innermost Apartments where he found  Vice  and  Folly  well receiv'd before him He join'd the Train recommended himself very quickly to his Landlord and enter'd into such Familiarity with  Vice  that he was enlisted in the same Company along with  Folly  They were frequent Guests of  Wealth  and from that Moment inseparable  Diffidence  in the mean Time not daring to approach the Great House accepted of an Invitation from POVERTY one of the Tenants and entering the Cottage found  Wisdom  and  Virtue  who being repuls'd by the Landlord had retir'd thither  Virtue  took Compassion of her and  Wisdom  found from  her Temper that she wou'd easily improve So they admitted her into their Society Accordingly by their Means she alter'd in a little Time somewhat of her Manner and becoming much more amiable and engaging was now call'd by the Name of MODESTY As ill Company has a greater Effect than good  Confidence  tho' more refractory to Counsel and Example degenerated so far by the Society of  Vice  and  Folly  as to pass by the Name of IMPUDENCE Mankind who saw these Societies as  Jupiter  first join'd them and knew nothing of these mutual Desertions are led into strange Mistakes by those Means and wherever they see  Impudence  make account of  Virtue  and  Wisdom  and wherever they observe  Modesty  call her Attendants  Vice  and  Folly  ESSAY IV That POLITICS may be reduc'd to a SCIENCE  IT is a great Question with several Whether there be any essential Difference betwixt one Form of Government and another and Whether every Form may not become good or bad according as it is well or ill administred  For Forms of Government let Fools contest  Whate'er is best administer'd is best  Essay on Man Book  Were it once admitted that all Governments are alike and that the only Difference consists in the Character and Conduct of the Governors most political Disputes wou'd be at an End and all  Zeal  for one Constitution above another must be esteem'd mere Bigotry and Folly But though I be a profest  Friend to  Moderation  I cannot forbear condemning this Sentiment and should be sorry to think that human Affairs admit of no greater Stability than what they receive from the casual Humours and Characters of particular Men  'TIS true those who maintain that the Goodness of all Government consists in the Goodness of the Administration may cite many particular Instances in History where the very same Government in different Hands varies suddenly into the two opposite Extremes of good and bad Compare the  French  Government under  Henry  III and under  Henry  IV Cruelty Oppression Levity Artifice on the Part of the Rulers Faction Sedition Treachery Rebellion Disloyalty on the Part of the Subjects These compose the Character of the former miserable Aera But when the Patriot and heroic Prince who succeeded was once firmly seated on the Throne the Government the People every Thing seem'd to be totally chang'd and all from the Change of the Temper and Sentiments of one single Man An equal Difference of a contrary Kind may be found in comparing the  Reigns of  Elisabeth  and  James  at least with Regard to foreign Affairs and Instances of this Kind may be multiply'd almost without Number from antient as well as modern History  BUT here I wou'd beg Leave to make a Distinction All absolute Governments and such the  English  Government was in a great Measure till the Middle of the last Century must very much depend on the Administration and this is one of the great Inconveniencies of that Form of Government But a Republican and free Government wou'd be a most glaring Absurdity if the particular Checks and Controuls provided by the Constitution had really no Influence and made it not the Interest even of bad Men to operate for the public Good Such is the Intention of these Forms of Government and such is the real Effect where they are wisely constituted As on the other Hand they are the Sources of all Disorder and of the blackest Crimes where either Skill or Honesty has been wanting in their original Frame and Institution So great is the Force of Laws and of particular Forms of Government and so little Dependence have they  on the Humours and Temper of Men that Consequences as general and as certain may be deduced from them on most Occasions as any which the Mathematical Sciences can afford us  THE  Roman  Government gave the whole Legislative Power to the Commons without allowing a Negative either to the Nobility or Consuls This unbounded Power the Commons possessed in a collective Body not in a Representative The Consequences were When the People by Success and Conquest had become very numerous and had spread themselves to a great Distance from the Capital the CityTribes tho' the most contemptible carried almost every Vote They were therefore most cajol'd by every one who affected Popularity They were supported in Idleness by the general Distribution of Corn and by particular Bribes which they received from almost every Candidate By this Means they became every Day more licentious and the  Campus Martius  was a perpetual Scene of Tumult and Sedition Armed Slaves were introduced among these rascally Citizens so that the whole Government fell into Anarchy and the greatest Happiness the  Romans  could  look for was the despotic Power of the  Caesars  Such are the Effects of Democracy without a Representative  A NOBILITY may possess the whole or any Part of the legislative Power of a State after two different Ways Either every Nobleman shares the Power as part of the whole Body or the whole Body enjoys the Power as composed of Parts which have each a distinct Power and Authority The  Venetian  Nobility are an Instance of the first kind of Government The  Polish  of the second In the  Venetian  Government the whole Body of Nobility possesses the whole Power and no Nobleman has any Authority which he receives not from the Whole In the  Polish  Government every Nobleman by Means of his Fiefs has a peculiar hereditary Authority over his Vassals and the whole Body has no Authority but what it receives from the Concurrence of its Parts The distinct Operations and Tendencies of these two Species of Government might be made most apparent even  a priori  A  Venetian  Nobility is infinitely preferable to a  Polish  let the Humours and Education of Men be ever so much vary'd A  Nobility who possess their Power in common will preserve Peace and Order both among themselves and their Subjects and no Member can have Authority enough to controul the Laws for a Moment They will preserve their Authority over the People but without any grievous Tyranny or any Breach of private Property because such a tyranninical Government is not the Interest of the whole Body however it may be the Interest of some Individuals There will be a Distinction of Rank betwixt the Nobility and People but this will be the only Distinction in the State The whole Nobility will form one Body and the whole People another without any of those private Feuds and Animosities which spread Ruin and Desolation everywhere 'Tis easy to see the Disadvantages of a  Polish  Nobility in every one of these Particulars  'TIS possible so to constitute a free Government as that a single Person call him Duke Prince or King shall possess a very large Share of the Power and shall form a proper Ballance or Counterpoise to the other Parts of the Legislature This chief Magistrate may be either  elective  or  hereditary  and tho' the  former Institution may to a superficial View appear most advantageous yet a more accurate Inspection will discover in it greater Inconveniencies than in the latter and such as are founded on Causes and Principles eternal and immutable The filling of the Throne in such a Government is a Point of too great and too general Interest not to divide the whole People into Factions From whence a Civil War the greatest of Ills may be apprehended almost with Certainty upon every Vacancy The Prince elected must be either a  Foreigner  or a  Native  The former will be ignorant of the People whom he is to govern suspicious of his new Subjects and suspected by them giving his Confidence entirely to Strangers who will have no other Thoughts but of enriching themselves in the quickest Manner while their Master's Favour and Authority is able to support them A Native will carry into the Throne all his private Animosities and Friendships and will never be regarded in his Elevation without exciting the Sentiments of Envy in those who formerly consider'd him as their Equal Not to mention that a Crown is too high a Reward ever to be given to Merit alone and will always  induce the Candidates to employ Force or Money or Intrigue to procure the Votes of the Electors So that such a Choice will give no better Chance for a superior Merit in the Prince than if the State had trusted to Birth alone to determine their Sovereign  IT may therefore be pronounced as an universal Axiom in Politics  That an hereditary Prince a Nobility without Vassals and a People voting by their Representatives form the best  MONARCHY ARISTOCRACY  and  DEMOCRACY But in order to prove more fully that Politics admit of general Truths which are invariable by the Humour or Education either of Subject or Sovereign it may not be amiss to observe some other Principles of this Science which may seem to deserve that Character  IT may easily be observ'd that though free Governments have been commonly the most happy for those who partake of their Freedom yet are they the most ruinous and oppressive for their Provinces And this Observation may I believe be fix'd as a Maxim of the kind we are here speaking of When a  Monarch extends his Dominions by Conquest he soon learns to consider his old and his new Subjects as on the same Footing because in reality all his Subjects are to him the same except the few Friends and Favourites with whom he is personally acquainted He does not therefore make any Distinction betwixt them in his  general  Laws and at the same Time is no less careful to prevent all  particular  Acts of Oppression in the one as in the other But a free State necessarily makes a great Distinction and must always do so 'till Men learn to love their Neighbours as well as themselves The Conquerors in such a Government are all Legislators and will be sure so to contrive Matters by Restrictions of Trade and by Taxes as to draw some private as well as public Advantage from their Conquests Provincial Governors have also a better Chance in a Republick to escape with their Plunder by means of Bribery or Interest and their FellowCitizens who find their own State to be inriched by the Spoils of their SubjectProvinces will be the more inclined to tolerate such Abuses Not to mention that 'tis a necessary Precaution in a free State to change the Governors  frequently which obliges these temporary Tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious that they may accumulate sufficient Wealth before they give place to their Successors What cruel Tyrants were the  Romans  over the World during the Time of their Commonwealth 'Tis true they had Laws to prevent Oppression in their Provincial Magistrates but  Cicero  informs us that the  Romans  could not better consult the Interest of the Provinces than by repealing these very Laws For says he in that Case our Magistrates having entire Impunity would plunder no more than would satisfy their own Rapaciousness Whereas at present they must also satisfy that of their Judges and of all the great Men of  Rome  whose Protection they stand in need of Who can read of the Cruelties and Oppressions of  Verres  without Horror and Astonishment And who is not touched with Indignation to hear that after  Cicero  had exhausted on that abandoned Criminal all the Thunders of the most divine Eloquence and had prevailed so far as to get him condemned to the utmost Extent of the Laws yet that cruel Tyrant lived peaceably to old Age in Opulence and Ease and thirty Years afterward  was put into the Proscription by  Mark Anthony  upon account of his exorbitant Wealth where he fell along with  Cicero  himself and all the most virtuous Men of  Rome  After the Dissolution of the Commonwealth the  Roman  Yoke became easier upon the Provinces as  Tacitus  informs us and it may be observed that many of the worst Emperors  Domitian  for instance were very careful to prevent all Oppression of the Provinces In  Vespasian  's Time  Gaul  was esteemed richer than  Italy  itself Nor do I find during the whole Time of the  Roman  Monarchy that the Empire became less rich or populous in any of its Provinces though indeed its Valour and military Discipline were always upon the Decline If we pass from antient to modern Times we shall find the same Observation to hold true The Provinces of obsolute Monarchies are always better treated than those of free States Compare the  Pais conquis  of  France  with  Ireland  and you'll be convinced of this Truth though this latter Kingdom being almost entirely peopled from  England  possesses so many Rights and Privileges as should naturally make it challenge better Treatment than that of a  conquered Province  Corsica  is also an obvious Instance to the same Purpose  THERE is an Observation of  Machiavel  with regard to the Conquests of  Alexander  the  Great  which I think may be regarded as one of those eternal political Truths which no Time or Accidents can vary It may seem strange says that Politician that such sudden Conquests as those of  Alexander  shou'd be possest so peaceably by his Successors and that the  Persians  during all the Confusions and civil Wars of the  Greeks  never made the smallest Effort towards the Recovery of their former independent Government To satisfy us concerning the Cause of this remarkable Event we may consider that a Monarch may govern his Subjects after two different Ways He may either follow the Maxims of the Eastern Princes and stretch his Power so far as to leave no Distinction of Ranks among his Subjects but what proceeds immediately from himself no Advantages of Birth no hereditary Honours and Possessions And in a Word no Credit among the People except from his Commission alone Or a Monarch may exert his Power in a milder Manner like our  European  Princes and leave other Sources of Honour beside his Smile and Favour Birth Titles Possessions Valour Integrity Knowledge or brave and fortunate Atchievements In the former Species of Government after a Conquest 'tis impossible ever to shake off the Yoke since no one possesses among the People so much personal Credit and Authority as to begin such an Enterprize Whereas in the latter Species of Government the least Misfortune or Discord of the Victors will encourage the Vanquish'd to take Arms who have Leaders ready to prompt and conduct them in every Undertaking  SUCH is the Reasoning of  Machiavel  which seems to me very solid and conclusive tho' I wish he had not mixt Falshood with Truth in asserting that Monarchies govern'd according to the Eastern Policy tho' more easily kept when once they are subdued yet are the most difficult to be subdued since they cannot contain any powerful Subject whose Discontent and Faction may facilitate the Enterprizes of an Enemy For besides that such a tyrannical Government enervates the Courage of Men and renders them indifferent  concerning the Fortunes of their Sovereign besides this I say we find by Experience that even the temporary and delegated Authority of the Generals and Magistrates being always in such Governments as absolute within its Sphere as that of the Prince himself is able with Barbarians accustom'd to a blind Submission to produce the most dangerous and fatal Revolutions So that in every Respect a gentle Government is preferable and gives the greatest Security to the Sovereign as well as to the Subject  LEGISLATORS therefore shou'd not trust the future Government of a State entirely to Chance but ought to provide a System of Laws to regulate the Administration of public Affairs to the latest Posterity Effects will always correspond to Causes and wise Regulations in any Commonwealth are the most valuable Legacy which can be left to future Ages In the smallest Court or Office the stated Forms and Methods by which Business must be conducted are found to be a considerable Check on the natural Depravity of Mankind Why shou'd not the Case be the same in public Affairs Can we ascribe the  Stability and Wisdom of the  Venetian  Government thro' so many Ages to any Thing but their Form of Government And is it not easy to point out those Defects in the original Constitution which produc'd the tumultuous Governments of  Athens  and  Rome  and ended at last in the Ruin of these two famous Republics And so little Dependence has this Affair on the Humours and Education of particular Men that one Part of the same Republic may be wisely conducted and another weakly by the very same Men merely by Reason of the Difference of the Forms and Institutions by which these Parts are regulated Historians inform us that this was actually the Case with  Genoa  For while the State was always full of Sedition and Tumult and Disorder the Bank of St  George  which had become a considerable Part of the People was conducted for several Ages with the utmost Integrity and Wisdom  Essempio veramenti raro da Filosofi intante loro imaginate vedute Republiche mai non trovato vedere dentro ad un medesimo cerchio fra medesimi cittadini la liberta la tirannide la vita civile la corrotta la giustitia la licenza perche quella ordine solo manti  ne quella citta piena di costumi antichi venerabili E s'egli auvenisse che col tempo in ogni modo auverr√† que San Giorgio tutta quella citt√† occupasse sarrebbe quella una Republica pin que la  Venetiana  memorabile  Della Hist Fiorentine Lib    HERE then is a sufficient Inducement to maintain with the utmost ZEAL in every free State those Forms and Institutions by which Liberty is secured the Publick Good consulted and the Avarice or Ambition of private Men restrained and punished Nothing does more Honour to human Nature than to see it susceptible of so noble a Passion as nothing can be a greater Indication of Meanness of Heart in any Man than to see him devoid of it A Man who loves only himself without Regard to Friendship or Merit is a detestable Monster and a Man who is only susceptible of Friendship without publick Spirit or a Regard to the Community is deficient in the most material Part of Virtue  BUT this is a Subject that need not be longer insisted on at present There are enough of Zealots on both Sides to kindle up the Passions of their Partizans and under the Pretence of publick Good pursue the Interests  and Ends of their particular Faction For my Part I shall always be more fond of promoting Moderation than Zeal though perhaps the surest Way of producing Moderation in every Party is to encrease our Zeal for the Public Let us therefore try if it be possible from the foregoing Doctrine to draw a Lesson of Moderation with regard to the Parties in which our Country is at present divided at the same Time that we allow not this Moderation to abate the Industry and Passion with which every Individual is bound to pursue the Good of his Country  THOSE who either attack or defend a Minister in such a Government as ours where the utmost Liberty is allowed always carry Matters to Extremes and exaggerate his Merit or Demerit with regard to the Publick His Enemies are sure to charge him with the greatest Enormities both in domestic and foreign Management and there is no Meanness or Crime of which in their Account he is not capable Unnecessary Wars scandalous Treaties Profusion of public Treasure oppressive Taxes every kind of Maleadministration is ascribed to him To aggravate the  Charge his pernicious Conduct it is said will extend its baneful Influence even to Posterity by undermining the best Constitution in the World and disordering that wise System of Laws Institutions and Customs by which our Ancestors for so many Centuries have been so happily governed He is not only a wicked Minister in himself but has removed every Security provided against wicked Ministers for the future  ON the other Hand the Partizans of the Minister make his Panegyric run as high as the Accusation against him and celebrate his wise steady and moderate Conduct in every Part of his Administration The Honour and Interest of the Nation supported abroad public Credit maintain'd at home Persecution restrain'd Faction subdu'd the Merit of all these Blessings is ascrib'd solely to the Minister At the same Time he crowns all his other Merits by a religious Care of the best Constitution in the World which he has preserv'd inviolate in all its Parts and has transmitted entire to be the Happiness and Security of the latest Posterity  WHEN this Accusation and Panegyric are receiv'd by the Partizans of each Party no Wonder they engender a most extraordinary Ferment on both Sides and fill the whole Nation with the most violent Animosities But I wou'd fain perswade these PartyZealots that there is a flat Contradiction both in the Accusation and Panegyric and that it were impossible for either of them to run so high were it not for this Contradiction if our Constitution be really  Dissertation on Parties  Letter    that noble Fabric the pride of  Britain  the Envy of our Neighbours rais'd by the Labour of so many Centuries repair'd at the Expence of so many Millions and cemented by such a Profusion of Blood  I say if our Constitution does in any Degree deserve these Elogiums it wou'd never have endur'd a wicked and a weak Minister to govern triumphantly for a Course of Twenty Years when oppos'd by the greatest Geniuses of the Nation who exercis'd the utmost Liberty of Tongue and Pen in Parliament and in their frequent Appeals to the People But if the Minister be wicked and weak to the Degree so strenuously insisted on the Constitution  must be faulty in its original Principles and the Minister cannot consistently be charg'd with undermining the best Constitution of the World A Constitution is only so far good as it provides a Remedy against Maleadministration and if the  British  Constitution when in its greatest Vigour and repair'd by two such remarkable Events as the  Revolution  and  Accession  by which our antient Royal Family was sacrificed to it if our Constitution I say with so great Advantages does not in Fact provide any such Remedy against Maleadministration we are rather beholden to any Minister that undermines it and affords us an Opportunity of erecting a better Constitution in its Place  I WOU'D make Use of the same Topics to moderate the Zeal of those who defend the Minister If our Constitution be so excellent a Change of Ministry can be no such dreadful Event since 'tis essential to such a Constitution in every Ministry both to preserve itself from Violation and to prevent all Enormities in the Administration If our Constitution be bad so extraordinary a Jealousy and Apprehension on Account of Changes is illplac'd  and a Man shou'd no more be anxious in this Case than a Husband who had marry'd a Woman from the Stews shou'd be watchful to prevent her Infidelity Public Affairs in such a Constitution must necessarily go to Confusion by whatever Hands they are conducted and the Zeal of  Patriots  is much less requisite in that Case than the Patience and Submission of  Philosophers  The Virtue and good Intentions of  Cato  and  Brutus  are highly laudable But to what Purpose did their Zeal serve To nothing but to hasten the fatal Period of the  Roman  Government and render its Convulsions and dying Agonies more violent and painful  I WOU'D not be understood to mean that public Affairs deserve no Care and Attention at all Wou'd Men be moderate and consistent their Claims might be admitted at least might be examin'd The  Country Party  might still assert that our Constitution tho' excellent will admit of Maleadministration to a certain Degree and therefore if the Minister be bad 'tis proper to oppose him with a  suitable  Degree of Zeal And on the other Side the  CourtParty  may be allow'd upon  the Supposition that the Minister were good to defend and with  some  Zeal too his Administration I wou'd only perswade Men not to contend as if they were fighting  pro aris focis  and change a good Constitution into a bad one by the Violence of their Factions  I HAVE not here consider'd any Thing that is personal in the present Controversy In the best Constitution of the World where every Man is restrain'd by the most rigid Laws 'tis easy to discover either the good or bad Intentions of a Minister and to judge whether his personal Character deserves Love or Hatred But such Questions are of little Importance to the Public and ly under a just Suspicion either of Malevolence or Flattery in those who employ their Pens upon them  ESSAY V Of the first PRINCIPLES of GOVERNMENT  NOTHING is more surprising to those who consider human Affairs with a Philosophical Eye than to see the Easiness with which the many are governed by the few and to observe the implicite Submission with which Men resign their own Sentiments and Passions to those of their Rulers When we enquire by what Means this Wonder is brought about we shall find that as FORCE is always on the Side of the Governed the Governors have nothing to support them but OPINION 'Tis therefore on Opinion only that Government is founded and this Maxim extends to the most despotick and most military Governments as well as to the most free and most popular The  Soldan  of  Aegypt  or  the  Emperor  of  Rome  might drive his harmless Subjects like brute Beasts against their Sentiments and Inclination But he must at least have led his  Mamalukes  or  Praetorian Bands  like Men by their Opinion  OPINION is of two Kinds  viz  Opinion of INTEREST and Opinion of RIGHT By Opinion of Interest I chiefly understand the Sense of the public Advantage which is reapt from Government along with the Perswasion that the particular Government which is establish'd is equally advantageous with any other that cou'd easily be settled When this Opinion prevails among the Generality of a State or among those who have the Force in their Hands it gives great Security to any Government  RIGHT is of two Kinds Right to POWER and Right to PROPERTY What Prevalence Opinion of the first Kind has over Mankind may easily be understood by observing the Attachment which all Nations have to their antient Government and even to those Names which have had the Sanction of Antiquity Antiquity always begets the Opinion of Right  and whatever disadvantageous Sentiment we may entertain of Mankind they are always found to be prodigal both of Blood and Treasure in the Maintenance of public Right This Passion we may denominate Enthusiasm or may give it what Appellation we please but a Politician who wou'd overlook its Influence on human Affairs wou'd prove himself to have but a very limited Understanding  'TIS sufficiently understood that the Opinion of Right to Property is of the greatest Moment in all Matters of Government A noted Author has made Property the Foundation of all Government and most of our political Writers seem inclin'd to follow him in that Particular This is carrying the Matter too far but still it must be own'd that the Opinion of Right to Property has a great Influence in this Subject  UPON these three Opinions therefore of Interest of Right to Power and of Right to Property are all Governments founded and all Authority of the few over the many There are indeed other Principles which add Force to these and determine limit or alter their  Operation such as  SelfInterest Fear  and  Affection  But still I assert that these other Principles can have no Influence alone but suppose the antecedent Influence of those Opinions abovemention'd They are therefore to be esteem'd the secondary not the original Principles of Government  FOR first as to  SelfInterest  by which I mean the Expectation of particular Rewards distinct from the general Protection which we receive from Government 'tis evident that the Magistrate's Authority must be antecedently establish'd or at least be hop'd for in order to produce this Expectation The Expectation of Reward may augment the Authority with regard to some particular Persons but can never give Birth to it with regard to the Public Men naturally look for the greatest Favours from their Friends and Acquaintance and therefore the Hopes of any considerable Number of the State wou'd never center in any particular Set of Men if these Men had no other Title to Magistracy and had no Influence over the Opinions of Mankind The same Observation may be extended to the other two Principles of  Fear  and  Affection  No Man wou'd have any Reason to  fear  the Fury of a Tyrant if he had no Authority over any but from Fear since as a single Man his bodily Force can reach but a small Way and whatever Power he has beyond must be founded either on our own Opinion or on the presum'd Opinion of others And tho'  Affection  to Wisdom and Virtue in a  Sovereign  extends very far and has great Influence yet he must be antecedently suppos'd to be invested with a publick Character otherwise the public Esteem will serve him in no Stead nor will his Virtue have any Influence beyond his private Sphere  A GOVERNMENT may endure for several Ages though the Ballance of Power and the Ballance of Property do not agree This chiefly happens where any Member of the State has acquired a large Share of the Property but from the original Constitution of the Government has no Share of the Power Under what Pretext would any Individual of that Order pretend to intermeddle in public Affairs As Men are commonly much attacht to their antient Government it is not to be expected that the Public would ever favour  such Usurpations But where the original Constitution allows any Share of the Power though small to an Order of Men that possesses a large Share of Property 'tis easy for them gradually to stretch their Authority and bring the Ballance of Power to coincide with that of Property This has been the Case with the House of Commons in  England  MOST Writers that have treated of the  British  Government have supposed that as the House of Commons represents all the Commons of  GreatBritain  so its Weight in the Scale is proportioned to the Property and Power of all whom they represent But this Principle must not be received as absolutely true For though the People are apt to attach themselves more to the House of Commons than to any other Member of the Constitution that House being chosen by them as their Representatives and as the public Guardians of their Liberty yet are there Instances where the House even when in Opposition to the Crown has not been follow'd by the People as we may particularly observe in the  Tory  House of Commons in the Reign of King  William  Were the Members  of the House obliged to receive Instructions from their Constituents like the  Dutch  Deputies this would entirely alter the Case and if such immense Power and Riches as those of the whole Commons of  Britain  were brought into the Scale 'tis not easy to conceive that the Crown could either influence that Multitude of People or withstand that Overballance of Property 'Tis true the Crown has great Influence over the collective Body of  Britain  in the Elections of Members but were this Influence which at present is only exerted once in seven Years to be employ'd in bringing over the People to every Vote it would soon be wasted and no Skill Popularity or Revenue could support it I must therefore be of Opinion that an Alteration in this particular would introduce a total Alteration in our Government and would soon reduce it to a pure Republic and perhaps to a Republic of no inconvenient Form For though the People collected in a Body like the  Roman  Tribes be quite unfit for Government yet when dispersed in small Bodies they are more susceptible both of Reason and Order the Force of popular Currents and Tides is in some Measure broke and the  public Interest may be pursued with Method and Constancy But 'tis needless to reason any farther concerning a Form of Government which is never likely to have place in  Britain  and which seems not to be the Aim of any Party amongst us Let us cherish and improve our antient Government as much as possible without encouraging a Passion for such dangerous Novelties  I SHALL conclude this Subject with observing that the present political Controversy with regard to  Instructions  is a very frivolous one and can never be brought to any Decision as it is managed by both Parties The CountryParty do not pretend that a Member is absolutely bound to follow such Instructions as an Ambassador or General is confined by his Orders and that his Vote is not to be received in the House but so far as it is conformable to them The CourtParty again do not pretend that the Sentiments of the People ought to have no Weight with every Member much less that he ought to despise the Sentiments of those whom he represents and with whom he is more particularly connected And if their Sentiments be  of Weight why ought they not to express these Sentiments The Question then is only concerning the Degrees of Weight which ought to be plac'd on Instructions But such is the Nature of Language that 'tis impossible for it to express distinctly these different Degrees and if Men will carry on a Controversy on this Head it may well happen that they may differ in their Language and yet agree in their Sentiments and differ in their Sentiments and yet agree in their Language Besides how is it possible to fix these Degrees considering the Variety of Affairs that come before the House and the Variety of Places which Members represent Ought the Instructions of  Totness  to have the same Weight as those of  London  Or Instructions with regard to the  Convention  which respected foreign Politics to have the same Weight as those with regard to the  Excise  which respected only our domestic Affairs  ESSAY VI Of LOVE and MARRIAGE  I Know not whence it proceeds that Women are so apt to take amiss every Thing that is said in Disparagement of the married State and always consider a Satyr upon Matrimony as a Satyr upon themselves Do they mean by this that they are the Parties principally concerned and that if a Backwardness to enter into that State should prevail in the World they would be the greatest Sufferers Or are they sensible that the Misfortunes and Miscarriages of the married State are owing more to their Sex than to ours I hope they do not intend to confess either of these two Particulars or to give such an Advantage to their Adversaries the Men as even to allow them to suspect it  I HAVE often had Thoughts of complying with this Humour of the Fair Sex and of writing a Panegyric upon Marriage But in looking around for Materials they seem'd to be of so mix'd a Nature that at the Conclusion of my Reflections I found I was as much dispos'd to write a Satyr which might be plac'd on the opposite Pages of my Panegyrick And I am afraid that as Satyr is on most Occasions thought to have more Truth in it than Panegyric I shou'd have done their Cause more Harm than Good by this Expedient To misrepresent Facts is what I know they will not require of me I must be more a Friend to Truth than even to them where their Interests are opposite  I SHALL tell the Women what it is our Sex complains of most in the married State and if they be disposed to satisfy us in this Particular all the other Differences will be easily accomodated If I be not mistaken 'tis their Love of Dominion which is the Ground of the Quarrel though 'tis very likely that they will think it an unreasonable Love of it in us which makes us insist so much upon that Point However this may be no Passion  seems to have more Influence on female Minds than this for Power and there is a remarkable Instance in History of its prevailing above another Passion which is the only one that can be supposed a proper Counterpoise for it We are told that all the Women in  Scythia  once conspired against the Men and kept the Secret so well that they executed their Design before they were suspected They surprised the Men in Drink or asleep bound them all fast in Chains and having called a solemn Council of the whole Sex it was debated what Expedient should be used to improve the present Advantage and prevent their falling again into Slavery To kill all the Men did not seem to the Relish of any Part of the Assembly notwithstanding the Injuries formerly receiv'd and they were afterwards pleased to make a great Merit of this Lenity of theirs It was therefore agreed to put out the Eyes of the whole male Sex and thereby resign for ever after all the Vanity they could draw from their Beauty in order to secure their Authority We must no longer pretend to dress and Show say they but then we shall be free from Slavery We shall hear no more tender  Sighs but in return we shall hear no more imperious Commands Love must for ever leave us but he will carry Subjection along with him  'TIS regarded by some as an unlucky Circumstance since the Women were resolved to main the Men and deprive them of some of their Senses in order to render them humble and dependent that the Sense of hearing could not serve their Purpose since 'tis probable the Females would rather have attack'd that than the Sight And I think it is agreed among the Learned that in a married State 'tis not near so great an Inconvenience to lose the former Sense as the latter However this may be we are told by modern Anecdotes that some of the  Scythian  Women did secretly spare their Husbands Eyes presuming I suppose that they could govern them as well by means of that Sense as without it But so incorrigible and intractable were these Men that their Wives were all obliged in a few Years as their Youth and Beauty decay'd to imitate the Example of their Sisters which it was no difficult Matter to do in a State where the female Sex had once got the Superiority  I KNOW not if our  Scotish  Ladies derive any Thing of this Humour from their  Scythian  Ancestors but I must confess that I have often been surpriz'd to see a Woman very well pleas'd to take a Fool for her Mate that she might govern with the less Controul and cou'd not but think her Sentiments in this Respect still more barbarous than those of the  Scythian  Women abovemention'd as much as the Eyes of the Understanding are more valuable than those of the Body  BUT to be just and to lay the Blame more equally I am afraid it is the Fault of our Sex if the Women be so fond of Rule and that if we did not abuse our Authority they wou'd never think it worth while to dispute it Tyrants we know produce Rebels and all History informs us that Rebels when they prevail are apt to become Tyrants in their Turn For this Reason I cou'd wish there were no Pretensions to Authority on either Side but that every Thing was carry'd on with perfect Equality as betwixt two equal Members of the same Body And to induce both Parties to embrace those amicable Sentiments I shall  deliver to them  Plato  's Account of the Origin of Love and Marriage  MANKIND according to that fanciful Philosopher were not in their Original divided into Male and Female as at present but each individual Person was a Compound of both Sexes and was in himself both Husband and Wife melted down into one living Creature This Union no Doubt was very entire and the Parts very well adjusted together since there resulted a perfect Harmony betwixt the Male and Female altho' they were oblig'd to be inseparable Companions And so great was the Harmony and Happiness flowing from it that the ANDROGYNES for so  Plato  calls them or MENWOMEN became insolent upon their Prosperity and rebell'd against the Gods To punish them for this Temerity  Jupiter  cou'd contrive no better Expedient than to divorce the MalePart from the Female and make two imperfect Beings of the Compound which was before so perfect Hence the Origin of Men and Women as distinct Creatures But notwithstanding this Division so lively is our Remembrance of the Happiness we enjoy'd in our primaeval State that we  are never at Rest in this Situation but each of these Halves is continually searching thro' the whole Species to find the other Half which was broken from it And when they meet they join again with the greatest Fondness and Sympathy But it often happens that they are mistaken in this Particular that they take for their Half what no Way corresponds to them and that the Parts do not meet nor join in with each other as is usual in Fractures In this Case the Union is soon dissolv'd and each Part is set loose again to hunt for its lost Half joining itself to every one it meets by Way of Trial and enjoying no Rest till its perfect Sympathy with its Partner shews that it has at last been successful in its Endeavours  WERE I dispos'd to carry on this Fiction of  Plato  which accounts for the mutual Love betwixt the Sexes in so agreeable a Manner I wou'd do it by the following Allegory  WHEN  Jupiter  had separated the Male from the Female and had quell'd their Pride and Ambition by so severe an Operation he cou'd not but repent him of the Cruelty of his Vengeance  and take Compassion on poor Mortals who were now become incapable of any Repose or Tranquility Such Cravings such Anxieties such Necessities arose as made them curse their Creation and think Existence itself a Punishment In vain had they Recourse to every other Occupation and Amusement In vain did they seek after every Pleasure of Sense and every Refinement of Reason Nothing cou'd fill that Void which they felt in their Hearts or supply the Loss of their Partner who was so fatally separated from them To remedy this Disorder and to bestow some Comfort at least on human Race in their forelorn Situation  Jupiter  sent down LOVE and HYMEN to collect the broken Halves of human Kind and piece them together in the best Manner possible These two Deities found such a prompt Disposition in Mankind to unite again in their primitive State that they proceeded on their Work with wonderful Success for some Time till at last from many unlucky Accidents Dissension arose betwixt them The chief Counsellor and Favourite of  Hymen  was CARE who was continually filling his Patron's Head with Prospects of Futurity a Settlement Family Children Servants so  that little else was regarded in all the Matches  they  made On the other Hand  Love  had chosen PLEASURE for his Favourite who was as pernicious a Counsellor as the other and wou'd never allow  Love  to look beyond the present momentary Gratification or the satisfying of the prevailing Inclination These two Favourites became in a little Time irreconcilable Enemies and made it their chief Business to undermine each other in all their Undertakings No sooner had  Love  fixt upon two Halves which he was cementing together and forming to a close Union but  Care  insinuates himself and bringing  Hymen  along with him dissolves the Union produc'd by  Love  and joins each Half to some other Half which he had provided for it To be reveng'd of this  Pleasure  creeps in upon a Pair already join'd by  Hymen  and calling  Love  to his Assistance they Underhand contrive to join each Half by secret Links to Halves which  Hymen  was wholly unacquainted with It was not long before this Quarrel was felt in its pernicious Consequences and such Complaints arose before the Throne of  Jupiter  that he was oblig'd to summon the offending Parties to appear before him in order to give  an Account of their Proceedings After hearing the Pleadings on both Sides he order'd an immediate Reconcilement betwixt  Love  and  Hymen  as the only Expedient for giving Happiness to Mankind And that he might be sure this Reconcilement shou'd be durable he laid his strict Injunctions on them never to join any Halves without consulting their Favourites  Care  and  Pleasure  and obtaining the Consent of both to the Conjunction Where this Order is strictly observ'd the  Androgyne  is perfectly restor'd and human Race enjoy the same Happiness as in their primaeval State The Seam is scarce perceiv'd that joins the two Beings together but both of them combine to form one perfect and happy Creature  ESSAY VII Of the STUDY of HISTORY  THERE is nothing I would recommend more earnestly to my female Readers than the Study of History as an Occupation of all others the best suited both to their Sex and Education much more instructive than their ordinary Books of Amusement and more entertaining than those serious Compositions which are usually to be found in their Closets Among other important Truths which they may learn from History they may be informed of two Particulars the Knowledge of which may contribute very much to their Quiet and Repose  That  our Sex as well as theirs are far from being such perfect Creatures as they are apt to imagine and  That  Love is not the only Passion that governs the MaleWorld but is often overcome  by Avarice Ambition Vanity and a thousand other Passions Whether they be the false Representations of Mankind in those two Particulars that endear Romances and Novels so much to the fair Sex I know not but must confess I am sorry to see them have such an Aversion to Matter of Fact and such an Appetite for Falshood I remember I was once desired by a young Beauty for whom I had some Passion to send her some Novels and Romances for her Amusement in the Country but was not so ungenerous as to take the Advantage which such a Course of Reading might have given me being resolved not to make Use of poisoned Arms against her I therefore sent her  Plutarch  's Lives assuring her at the same Time that there was not a Word of Truth in them from Beginning to End She perused them very attentively 'till she came to the Lives of  Alexander  and  Caesar  whose Names she had heard of by Accident and then returned me the Book with many Reproaches for deceiving her  I MAY indeed be told that the fair Sex have no such Aversion to History as I have represented provided it be  secret  History and  contain some memorable Transaction proper to excite their Curiosity But as I do not find that Truth which is the Basis of History is at all regarded in those Anecdotes I cannot admit of this as a Proof of their Passion for that Study However this may be I see not why the same Curiosity might not receive a more proper Direction and lead them to desire Accounts of those who lived in past Ages as well as of their Contemporaries What is it to  Cleora  whether  Fulvia  entertains a secret Commerce of Love with  Philander  or not Has she not equal Reason to be pleased when she is informed what is whispered about among Historians that  Cato  's Sister had an Intrigue with  Caesar  and palmed her Son  Marcus Brutus  upon her Husband for his own though in Reality he was her Gallant's And are not the Loves of  Messalina  or  Julia  as proper Subjects of Discourse as any Intrigue that this City has produced of late Years  BUT I know not whence it comes that I have been thus seduced into a kind of Raillery against the Ladies Unless perhaps it proceed from the same Cause that makes the Person who is the Favourite of the Company  be often the Object of their goodnatur'd Jests and Pleasantries We are pleased to address our selves after any manner to a Person that is agreeable to us and at the same Time presume that nothing will be taken amiss by one who is secure of the good Opinion and Affections of every one present I shall now proceed to handle my Subject more seriously and shall point out the many Advantages that flow from the Study of History and show how well suited it is to every one but particularly to those who are debarred the severer Studies by the Tenderness of their Complexion and the Weakness of their Education The Advantages found in History seem to be of three kinds as it amuses the Fancy as it improves the Understanding and as it strengthens Virtue  IN reality what more agreeable Entertainment to the Mind than to be transported into the remotest Ages of the World and to observe human Society in its Infancy making the first faint Essays towards the Arts and Sciences To see the Policy of Government and the Civility of Conversation refining by Degrees and every thing that is ornamental to  human Life advancing towards its Perfection To remark the Rise Progress Declension and final Extinction of the most flourishing Empires The Virtues which contributed to their Greatness and the Vices which drew on their Ruin In short to see all human Race from the Beginning of Time pass as it were in Review before us appearing in their true Colours without any of those Disguises which during their Lifetime so much perplexed the Judgments of the Beholders What Spectacle can be imagined so magnificent so various so interesting What Amusement either of the Senses or Imagination can be compared with it Shall those trifling Pastimes which engross so much of our Time be preferr'd as more satisfactory and more fit to engage our Attention How perverse must that Taste be which is capable of so wrong a Choice of Pleasures  BUT History is a most improving Part of Knowledge as well as an agreeable Amusement and indeed a great Part of what we commonly call  Erudition  and value so highly is nothing but an Acquaintance with historical Facts An extensive Knowledge of this  kind belongs to Men of Letters but I must think it an unpardonable Ignorance in Persons of whatever Sex or Condition not to be acquainted with the History of their own Country along with the Histories of antient  Greece  and  Rome  A Woman may behave herself with good Manners and have even some Vivacity in her Turn of Wit but where her Mind is so unfurnish'd 'tis impossible her Conversation can afford any Entertainment to Men of Sense and Reflection  I MUST add that History is not only a valuable Part of Knowledge but opens the Door to many other Parts of Knowledge and affords Materials to most of the Sciences And indeed if we consider the Shortness of human Life and our limited Knowledge even of what passes in our own Time we must be sensible that we should be for ever Children in Understanding were it not for this Invention which extends our Experience to all past Ages and to the most distant Nations making them contribute as much to our Improvement in Wisdom as if they had actually lain under our Observation A Man acquainted with History may in some respect  be said to have lived from the Beginning of the World and to have been making continual Additions to his Stock of Knowledge in every Century  THERE is also an Advantage in that Knowledge which is acquired by History above what is learned by the Practice of the World that it brings us acquainted with human Affairs without diminishing in the least from the most delicate Sentiments of Virtue And to tell the Truth I know not any Study or Occupation so unexceptionable as History in this particular Poets can paint Virtue in the most charming Colours but as they address themselves entirely to the Passions they often become Advocates for Vice Even Philosophers are apt to bewilder themselves in the Subtilty of their Speculations and we have seen some go so far as to deny the Reality of all moral Distinctions But I think it a Remark worthy the Attention of the speculative Reader that the Historians have been almost without Exception the true Friends of Virtue and have always represented it in its proper Colours however they may have erred in their Judgments of particular Persons  Machiavel  himself discovers a true Sentiment of Virtue in his History of  Florence  When he talks as a  Politician  he considers Poisoning Assassination and Perjury as lawful Arts of Power but when he speaks as an  Historian  he shows so keen an indignation against Vice and so warm an Approbation of Virtue in many Passages that I could not forbear applying to him that Remark of  Horace  That if you chace away Nature though with never so great Indignity she will always return upon you Nor is this Combination of Historians in favour of Virtue at all difficult to be accounted for When a Man of Business enters into Life and Action he is more apt to consider the Characters of Men as they have Relation to his Interest than as they stand in themselves and has his Judgment warped on every Occasion by the Violence of his Passion When a Philosopher contemplates Characters and Manners in his Closet the general abstract View of the Objects leaves the Mind so cold and unmoved that the Sentiments of Nature have no Room to play and he scarce feels the Difference betwixt Vice and Virtue History keeps in a just Medium betwixt these Extremes and places the Objects in their true  Point of View The Writers of History as well as the Readers are sufficiently interested in the Characters and Events to have a lively Sentiment of Blame or Praise and at the same Time have no particular Interest or Concern to pervert their Judgment  Verae voces tum demum pectore ab imo Eliciuntur  ESSAY VIII Of the INDEPENDENCY of PARLIAMENT  I HAVE frequently observ'd in comparing the Conduct of the  Court  and  Country  Party that the former are commonly less assuming and dogmatical in Conversation more apt to make Concessions and tho' not perhaps more susceptible of Conviction yet more able to bear Contradiction than the latter who are apt to fly out upon any Opposition and to regard one as a mercenary designing Fellow if he argues with any Coolness and Impartiality or makes any Concessions to their Adversaries This is a Fact which I believe every one may have observ'd who has been much in Companies where political Questions have been discuss'd tho' were one to ask the Reason of this Difference  every Party wou'd be apt to assign a different Reason Gentlemen in the  Opposition  will ascribe it to the very Nature of their Party which being founded on public Spirit and a Zeal for the Constitution cannot easily endure such Doctrines as are of pernicious Consequence to Liberty The Courtiers on the other Hand will be apt to put us in Mind of the Clown mention'd by Lord  Shaftsbury  "A Clown says that  Miscellaneous Reflections Page  excellent Author once took a Fancy to hear the  Latin  Disputes of Doctors at an University He was askt what Pleasure he cou'd take in viewing such Combatants when he cou'd never know so much as which of the Parties had the better"  For that Matter  reply'd the Clown  "  I a'n't such a Fool neither but I can see who's the first that puts to'other into a passion  Nature herself dictated this Lesson to the Clown that he who had the better of the Argument wou'd be easy and wellhumour'd But he who was unable to support his Cause by Reason wou'd naturally lose his Temper and grow violent"  To which of these Reasons shall we adhere To neither of them in my Opinion Unless we have amind to inlist ourselves and become Zealots in either Party I believe I can assign the Reason of this different Conduct of the two Parties without offending either The CountryParty are plainly most popular at present and perhaps have been so in most Administrations So that being accustom'd to prevail in Company they cannot endure to hear their Opinions controverted but are as confident on the publick Favour as if they were supported in all their Sentiments by the most infallible Demonstration The Courtiers on the other Hand are commonly so run down by your popular Talkers that if you speak to them with any Moderation or make them the smallest Concessions they think themselves extremely oblig'd to you and are apt to return the Favour by a like Moderation and Facility on their Part To be furious and passionate they know wou'd only gain them the Character of  shameless Mercenaries  not that of  zealous Patriots  which is the Character that such a warm Behaviour is apt to acquire to the other Party  IN all Controversies we find without regarding the Truth or Falshood on either Side that those who defend the establisht and popular Opinions are always most dogmatical and imperious in their Stile While their Adversaries affect a most extraordinary Gentleness and Moderation in order to soften as much as possible any Prejudices that may ly against them Consider the Behaviour of our  Freethinkers  of all Denominations whether they be such as decry all Revelation or only oppose the exorbitant Power of the Clergy  Collins Tindal Foster Hoadley  Compare their Moderation and Goodmanners with the furious Zeal and Scurrility of their Adversaries and you will be convinc'd of the Truth of my Observation A like Difference may be observ'd in the Conduct of those  French  Writers who maintain'd the Controversy with regard to antient and modern Learning  Boileau Monsieur Madame Dacier l'Abbe de Bos  who defended the Party of the Antients mixt their Reasonings with Satyre and Invective While  Fontenelle la Motte Charpentier  and even  Perrault  never transgress'd the Bounds of Moderation and  Goodbreeding tho' provok'd by the most injurious Treatment of their Adversaries  I MUST however observe that this Remark with regard to the seeming Moderation of the  Court  Party is entirely confin'd to Conversation and to Gentlemen who have been engag'd by Interest or Inclination in that Party For as to the CourtWriters being commonly hir'd Scriblers they are altogether as scurrilous as the Mercenaries of the other Party nor has the  Gazeteer  any Advantage in this Respect above  Common Sense  A Man of Education will in any Party discover himself to be such by his Goodbreeding and Decency as a Scoundrel will always betray the opposite Qualities  The false Accusers accus'd  c is very scurrillous tho' that Side of the Question being least popular shou'd be defended with most Moderation When Ld  Be  Ld  Mt  Mr  Ln  take the Pen in Hand tho' they write with Warmth they presume not upon their Popularity so far as to transgress the Bounds of Decency  I AM led into this Train of Reflection by considering some Papers wrote upon that  grand Topic of  CourtInfluence and Parliamentary Dependence  where in my humble Opinion the CountryParty show too rigid an Inflexibility and too great a Jealousy of making Concessions to their Adversaries Their Reasonings lose their Force by being carry'd too far and the Popularity of their Opinions has seduc'd them to neglect in some Measure their Justness and Solidity The following Reasoning will I hope serve to justify me in this Opinion  POLITICAL Writers have establish'd it as a Maxim That in contriving any System of Government and fixing the several Checks and Controuls of the Constitution every Man ought to be suppos'd a  Knave  and to have no other End in all his Actions but private Interest By this Interest we must govern him and by Means of it make him cooperate to public Good notwithstanding his insatiable Avarice and Ambition Without this say they we shall in vain boast of the Advantages of any Constitution and shall find in the End that we have no Security for our Liberties or Possessions except the Goodwill  of our Rulers that is we shall have no Security at all  'TIS therefore a just  political  Maxim  That every Man must be supposed a Knave  Tho' at the same Time I must own it appears somewhat strange that a Maxim should be true in  Politics  which is false in  Fact  But to satisfy us on this Head we may consider that Men are generally more honest in their private than in their public Character and will go greater Lengths to serve a Party than where their own private Interest is alone concerned Honour is a great Check upon Mankind But where a considerable Body of Men act together this Check is in a great measure removed since a Man is sure to be approved of by his own Party for what promotes the common Interest and soon learns to despise the Clamours of his Adversaries To which we may add that every Court or Senate is determined by the Majority so that if SelfInterest influences only the Majority as it will always do in the present depraved State of Mankind the whole Senate follows the Allurements of this separate Interest and acts  as if it contained not one Member who had any Regard to public Interest and Liberty  WHEN therefore there offers to my Censure and Examination any Plan of Government real or imaginary where the Power is distributed among several Courts and several Orders of Men I always consider the private Interest of each Court and each Order and if I find that by the artful Division of the Power the private Interest must necessarily in its Operation concur with the public I pronounce that Government to be wise and happy If on the contrary the private Interest of each Order be not check'd and be not directed to publick Interest I shall look for nothing but Faction Disorder and Tyranny from such a Government In this Opinion I am justified by Experience as well as by the Authority of all Philosophers and Politicians both antient and modern  HOW much therefore would it have surprised such a Genius as  Cicero  or  Tacitus  to have been told that in a future Age there should arise a very regular System of  mixt  Government where the Power was  so distributed that one Rank whenever it pleased might swallow up all the rest and engross the whole Power of the Constitution Such a Government they would have been apt to say will not be a mixt Government For so great is the natural Ambition of Men that they are never satisfied with Power and if one Order of Men by pursuing the Interest of their Order can usurp upon every other Order it will certainly do so and render itself as far as possible absolute and uncontroulable  BUT in this Opinion Experience shows they would have been mistaken For this is actually the Case with the  British  Constitution The Share of Power allotted by our Constitution to the House of Commons is so great that it absolutely commands all the other Parts of our Government The King's legislative Power is plainly no proper Check to it For though the King has a Negative in the passing of all Laws yet this in Fact is esteemed of so little Moment that whatever passes the two Houses is always sure to be pass'd into a Law and the Royal Assent is little beter than a mere Form The principal  Weight of the Crown lies in the executive Power But besides that the executive Power in every Government is altogether subordinate to the legislative besides this I say the Exercise of this Power requires an immense Expence and the Commons have assumed to themselves the sole Power of disposing of public Money How easy therefore would it be for that House to wrest from the Crown all these Powers one after another by making every Grant of Money conditional and choosing their Time so well that their Refusal of Subsidies should only distress the Government without giving foreign Powers any Advantage over us Did the House of Commons depend in the same manner on the King and had none of the Members any Property but from his Gift would not he command all their Resolutions and be from that Moment absolute As to the House of Lords they are a very powerful Support to the Crown as long as they are in their Turn supported by it but both Experience and Reason show us that they have no Force nor Authority sufficient to maintain themselves alone without any such Support  How therefore shall we solve this Paradox And by what Means is this Member of our Constitution confin'd within its proper Limits since from our very Constitution it must necessarily have as much Power as it demands and can only be confin'd by itself How is this consistent with our constant Experience of human Nature I answer that the Interest of the Body is here restrain'd by the Interest of the Individuals and that the House of Commons stretches not its Power because such an Usurpation would be contrary to the Interest of the Majority of its Members The Crown has so many Offices at its Disposal that when assisted by the honest and disinterested Part of the House it will always command the Resolutions of the whole so far at least as to preserve the antient Constitution from Danger We may therefore give to this Influence what Name we please we may call it by the invidious Appellations of  Corruption  and  Dependence  but some Degree and some Kind of it are inseparable from the very Nature of the Constitution and necessary to the Preservation of our mixt Government  INSTEAD then of asserting  See  Dissertation on Parties  throughout  absolutely that the Dependence of Parliament in every Degree is an Infringement of  British  Liberty the CountryParty would have done better to have made some Concessions to their Adversaries and have only examined what was the proper Degree of this Dependence beyond which it became dangerous to Liberty But such a Moderation is not to be expected of Partymen of any kind After a Concession of this Nature all Declamation must be abandoned and a serious calm Enquiry into the proper Degrees of CourtInfluence and Parliamentary Dependence would have been expected by the Readers And tho' the Advantage in such a Controversy might possibly remain to the  CountryParty  yet the Victory would not have been so compleat as they wish for nor would a true Patriot have given an entire Loose to his Zeal for fear of running Matters into a contrary Extreme by diminishing too  By that  Influence of the Crown  which I would justify I mean only that arising from the Offices and Honours that are at the Disposal of the Crown As to private  Bribery  it may be considered in the same Light as the Practice of employing Spies which is scarce justifiable in a good Minister and is infamous in a bad one But to be a Spy or to be corrupted is always infamous in all Ministers and is to be regarded as a shameless Prostitution  far the Influence of the Crown 'Twas therefore  thought best to deny that this Extreme could ever be dangerous to the Constitution or that the Crown could ever have too little Influence over Members of Parliament  ALL Questions concerning the proper Medium betwixt any two Extremes are very difficult to be decided both because it is difficult to find  Words  proper to fix this Medium and because the Good and Ill in such Cases run so gradually into each other as even to render our  Sentiments  doubtful and uncertain But there is a peculiar Difficulty in the present Case which would embarrass the most knowing and most impartial Examiner The Power of the Crown is always lodged in a single Person either King or Minister and as this Person may have either a greater or less Degree of Ambition Capacity Courage Popularity or Fortune the Power which is too great in one Hand may become too little in another  In pure Republics where the Power is distributed among several Assemblies or Senates the Checks and Controuls are more regular in their Operation because the Members of such numerous Assemblies may be presumed to be always nearly equal in Capacity and Virtue and 'tis only their Number Riches or Authority that enter into Consideration But a limited Monarchy admits not of any such Stability nor is it possible to assign to the Crown such a determinate Degree of Power as will in every Hand form a proper Counterballance to the other Parts of the Constitution This is an unavoidable Disadvantage among the many Advantages attending that Species of Government  ESSAY IX Whether the BRITISH GOVERNMENT inclines more to ABSOLUTE MONARCHY or to a REPUBLIC  IT affords a violent Prejudice against almost every Art and Science that no prudent Man however sure of his Principles dare prophesy concerning any Event or foretell the remote Consequences of Things No Physician will venture to pronounce concerning the Condition of his Patient a Fortnight or Month after And still less dare a Politician foretell the Situation of public Affairs a few Years hence  Harrington  thought himself so sure of his general Principle  That the Ballance of Power depends on that of Property  that he ventured to pronounce it impossible ever to reestablish Monarchy in  England  But his Book was scarce published when the King was restored and we see that Monarchy has ever since subsisted upon the same Footing as before Notwithstanding of this unlucky Example I will venture to examine a very important Question  viz Whether the  British  Government inclines more to Absolute Monarchy or to a Republic and in which of these two Species of Government it will most probably terminate  As there seems not to be any great Danger of a sudden Revolution either Way I shall at least escape the Shame attending my Temerity if I should be found to have been mistaken  THOSE who assert that the Ballance of our Government inclines towards Absolute Monarchy may support their Opinion by the following Reasons That Property has a great Influence on Power cannot possibly be denied but yet the general Maxim  That the Ballance of the one depends upon the Ballance of the other  must be received with several Limitations 'Tis evident that much less Property in a single Hand will be able to counterballance a greater Property in several Hands not only because it is difficult to make many  Persons combine in the same Views and Measures but also because Property when united causes much greater Dependence than the same Property when dispersed An hundred Persons of a Year apiece can consume all their Income and no Body shall ever be the better for them except their Servants and Tradesmen who justly regard their Profits as the Product of their own Labour But a Man possest of a Year if he has either any Generosity or any Cunning may create a great Dependence by Obligations and still a greater by Expectations Hence we find that in all free Governments any Subject exorbitantly rich has always created Jealousy even tho' his Riches bore no manner of Proportion to the Riches of the State  Crassus  's Fortune if I remember well amounted only to  About l Sterling  Three Thousand Talents a Year and yet we find that though his Genius was nothing extraordinary he was able by Means of his Riches alone to counterballance during his Lifetime the Power of  Caesar  who afterwards became Master of the World The Wealth of  the  Medicis  made them Masters of  Florence  tho' 'tis probable it was very inconsiderable compared to the united Property of that opulent Republic  THESE Considerations are apt to make one entertain a very magnificent Idea of the  British  Spirit and Love of Liberty since we cou'd maintain our free Government during so many Centuries against our Sovereigns who besides the Power and Dignity and Majesty of the Crown have always been possest of much more Property than any Subject has ever enjoy'd in any Commonwealth But it may be said that this Spirit however great will never be able to support itself against that immense Property which is now lodg'd in the King and which is still increasing Upon a moderate Computation there are near three Millions at the Disposal of the Crown The civil List amounts to near a Million The Collection of all Taxes to another Million And the Employments in the Army and Navy along with Ecclesiastical Preferments above a third Million a monstruous Sum and what may fairly be computed to be more than a thirtieth Part of the whole Income and Labour  of the Kingdom When we add to this immense Property the increasing Luxury of the Nation our Proneness to Corruption along with the great Power and Prerogatives of the Crown and the Command of such numerous military Forces there is no one but must despair without extraordinary Efforts of being able to support our free Government much longer under all these Disadvantages  ON the other Hand those who maintain that the Byass of the  British  Government leans towards a Republic may support their Opinion by very specious Arguments It may be said that though this immense Property in the Crown be join'd to the Dignity of first Magistrate and to many other legal Powers and Prerogatives which should naturally give it a greater Influence yet it really becomes less dangerous to Liberty upon that very Account Were  Britain  a Republic and were any private Man possess'd of a Revenue a third or even a tenth Part as large as that of the Crown he would very justly excite Jealousy because he would infallibly have great Authority in the Government And such an irregular Authority not avowed by the Laws  is always more dangerous than a much greater Authority which is derived from them A  On ne monte jamais si haut que quand on ne sqait pas ou on va  said  Cromwell  to the President  de Bellievre  Man possess'd of usurp'd Authority can set no Bounds to his Pretensions His Partizans have Liberty to hope for every thing in his Favours His Enemies provoke his Ambition along with his Fears by the Violence of their Opposition And the Government being thrown into a Ferment every corrupted Humour in the State naturally gathers to him On the contrary a legal Authority though very great has always some Bounds which terminate both the Hopes and Pretensions of the Persons possess'd of it The Laws must have provided a Remedy against its Excesses Such an eminent Magistrate has much to fear and little to hope from his Usurpations And as his legal Authority is quietly submitted to he has little Temptation and little Opportunity of extending it farther Besides it happens with regard to ambitious Aims and Projects what may be observed with regard to Sects of Philosophy and Religion A new Sect excites such a Ferment  and is both opposed and defended with such Vehemence that it spreads always faster and multiplies its Partizans with greater Rapidity than any old established Opinion recommended by the Sanction of the Laws and of Antiquity Such is the Nature of Novelty that where any thing pleases it becomes doubly agreeable if new but if it displeases it is doubly displeasing upon that very Account And in most Cases the Violence of Enemies is favourable to ambitious Projects as well as the Zeal of Partizans  IT may farther be said That tho' Men be very much govern'd by Interest yet even Interest itself and all human Affairs are merely govern'd by  Opinion  Now there has been a very sudden and a very sensible Change in the Opinions of Men within these last Fifty Years by the Progress of Learning and of Liberty Most People in this Island have divested themselves of all superstitious Reverence to Names and Authority The Clergy have entirely lost their Credit Their Pretensions and Doctrines have been ridicul'd and even Religion can scarce support itself in the World The mere Name of  King  commands little Respect and  to talk of him as GOD's Vicegerent upon Earth or to give him any of those magnificent Titles which formerly dazl'd Mankind wou'd but excite Laughter in every one Tho' the Crown by Means of its large Revenue may maintain its Authority in Times of Tranquility upon private Interest and Influence yet as the least Shock or Convulsion must break all these Interests to Pieces the kingly Power being no longer supported by the settled Principles and Opinions of Men will immediately dissolve Had Men been in the same Disposition at the  Revolution  as they are at present Monarchy wou'd have run a great Risque of being entirely lost in this Island  DURST I venture to deliver my own Sentiments amidst these opposite Arguments I wou'd assert that unless there happen some extraordinary Convulsion the Power of the Crown by Means of its large Revenue is rather upon the Increase tho' at the same Time I own that its Progress seems to me very slow and almost insensible The Tide has run long and with some Rapidity to  the Side of popular Government and is just beginning to turn towards Monarchy  'TIS well known that every Government must come to a Period and that Death is unavoidable to the political as well as to the animal Body But as one Kind of Death may be preferable to another it may be enquir'd Whether it be more disirable for the  British  Constitution to terminate in a popular Government or in absolute Monarchy Here I wou'd declare frankly that tho' Liberty be infinitely preferable to Slavery in almost every Case yet I wou'd much rather wish to see an absolute Monarch than a Republic in this Island For let us consider what Kind of Republic we have Reason to expect The Question is not concerning any fine imaginary Republic which a Man may form a Plan of in his Closet There is no Doubt but a popular Government may be imagin'd more perfect than absolute Monarchy or even than our present Constitution But what Reason have we to expect that any such Government will ever be establish'd in  Britain  upon the Dissolution of our Monarchy If any single Person acquire Power enough to take our Constitution to Pieces  and put it up anew he is really an absolute Monarch and we have had already an Instance of this Kind sufficient to convince us that such a Person will never resign his Power or establish any free Government Matters therefore must be trusted to their natural Progress and Operation and the House of Commons according to its present Constitution mustbe the only Legislature in such a popular Government The Inconveniencies attending such a Situation of Affairs present themselves by Thousands If the House of Commons in such a Case ever dissolves itself which is not to be expected we may look for a Civil War every Election If it continues itself we shall suffer all the Tyranny of a Faction subdivided into new Factions And as such a violent Government cannot long subsist we shall at last after infinite Convulsions and Civil Wars find Repose in absolute Monarchy which it wou'd have been happier for us to have establish'd peaceably from the Beginning Absolute Monarchy therefore is the easiest Death the true  Euthanasia  of the  British  Constitution  THUS if we have Reason to be more jealous of Monarchy because the Danger is more imminent from that Quarter we have also Reason to be more jealous of popular Government because that Danger is more terrible This may teach us a Lesson of Moderation in all our political Controversies  ESSAY X Of PARTIES in general  OF all Men that distinguish themselves by memorable Atchievements the first Place of Honour in my Opinion is due to LEGISLATORS and Founders of States who transmit a System of Laws and Institutions to secure the Peace Happiness and Liberty of future Generations The Influence of useful Inventions in the Arts and Sciences may perhaps extend farther than those of wise Laws whose Effects are limited both in Time and Place but the Benefit arising from the former is not so sensible as that which proceeds from the latter Speculative Sciences do indeed improve the Mind but this Advantage reaches only to a few Persons who have Leisure to apply themselves to them And as to practical  Arts which encrease the Commodities and Enjoyments of Life 'tis well known that Men's Happiness consists not so much in an Abundance of these as in the Peace and Security with which they possess them And these Blessings can only be derived from good Government Not to mention that general Virtue and good Morals in a State which are so requisite to Happiness can never arise from the most refined Precepts of Philosophy or even the severest Injunctions of Religion but must proceed entirely from a virtuous Education the Effect of wise Laws and Institutions I must therefore be of a different Opinion from my Lord BACON in this Particular and must regard Antiquity as somewhat unjust in in its Distribution of Honour when it made Gods of all the Inventors of useful Arts such as  Ceres Bacchus Aesculapius  and dignified Legislators such as  Romulus  and  Theseus  only with the Appellation of DemiGods and Heroes  As much as Legislators and Founders of States ought to be honoured and respected among Men as much ought the Founders of Sects and Factions to be detested and hated because  the Influence of Factions is directly contrary to that of Laws Factions subvert Government render Laws impotent and beget the fiercest Animosities among Men of the same Nation who ought to give mutual Assistance and Protection to each other And what shou'd render the Founders of Factions more odious is the Difficulty of extirpating Factions when once they have taken rise in any State They naturally propagate themselves for many Centuries and seldom end but by the total Dissolution of that Government in which they are planted They are besides Seeds which grow most plentifully in the richest Soils and though despotic Governments be not entirely free from them it must be confess'd that they rise more easily and propagate themselves faster in free Governments where they always infect the Legislature itself which alone cou'd be able by the steady Application of Rewards and Punishments to eradicate them  FACTIONS or Parties may be divided into PERSONAL and REAL that is into Factions founded on personal Friendship or Animosity among those who compose the Factions  and into those founded on some real Difference of Sentiment or Interest The Reason of this Distinction is obvious though I must acknowledge that Parties are seldom found pure and unmixt either of the one kind or the other 'Tis not often seen that a Government divides into Factions where there is no Difference in the Views of these Factions either real or apparent trivial or material And in those Factions which are founded on the most real and most material Difference there is always found to be a great deal of personal Animosity or Affection But notwithstanding of this Mixture a Party may be denominated either personal or real according to that Principle which is predominant and is observed to have the greatest Influence  PERSONAL Factions arise most easily in small Republics Every domestic Quarrel becomes an Affair of State Love Vanity Emulation any Passion begets public Division as well as Ambition and Resentment The  Neri  and  Bianchi  of  Florence  the  Fregosi  and  Adorni  of  Genoa  the  Colonnesi  and  Orsini  of modern  Rome  were Parties of this kind  MEN have such a Propensity to divide into personal Factions that the smallest Appearance of real Difference will beget them What can be imagined more trivial than the Difference betwixt one Colour of Livery and another in HorseRaces And yet this Difference begot two most inveterate Factions in the  Greek  Empire the  Prasini  and  Veneti  who never suspended their Animosities 'till they ruined that unhappy Government  NOTHING is more usual than to see Parties which have begun upon a real Difference continue even after that Difference is lost When Men are once inlisted on different Sides they contract an Affection to the Persons with whom they are united and an Animosity against their Antagonists And these Passions they often transmit to their Posterity The real Difference betwixt  Guelf  and  Ghibbelline  was long lost in  Italy  before these Factions were extinguished The  Guelfs  adher'd to the Pope the  Ghibbellines  to the Emperor and yet the Family of  Sforsa  who were in Alliance with the Emperor though they were  Guelfs  being expelled  Milan  by the King  Lewis  XIIth  of  France  assisted by  Jacomo Trivulzio  and the  Ghibbellines  the Pope concurred with them and they form'd Leagues with the Pope against the Emperor  THE Civil Wars lately arisen in  Morocco  betwixt the  Blacks  and  Whites  merely on account of their Complexion are founded on a very pleasant Difference We laugh at them but I believe were Things rightly examin'd we afford much more Occasion of Ridicule to the  Moors  For pray what are all the Wars of Religion which have prevail'd in this polite and knowing Part of the World They are in my Opinion more absurd than the  Moorish  Civil Wars The Difference of Complexion is a sensible and a real Difference But the Difference about an Article of Faith which is utterly absurd and unintelligible is not a real Difference of Sentiments but only a Difference of a few Phrases and Expressions which one Party accepts of without understanding them and the other refuses in the same Manner Besides I do not find that the  Whites  in  Morocco  ever impos'd on the  Blacks  any Necessity of altering their Complexion or threaten'd them with Inquisitions  and penal Laws in case of Obstinacy Nor have the  Blacks  been more unreasonable in this Particular But is a Man's Opinion where he is able to form a real Opinion more at his Disposal than his Complexion And can one be induc'd by Force or Fear to do more than paint and Disguise in the one Case as well as in the other  REAL  Factions may be divided into Factions from  Interest  from  Principle  and from  Affection  Of all Factions those from Interest are the most reasonable and the most excusable Where two Orders of Men such as the Nobles and People have a distinct Authority in a Government which is not very accurately ballanc'd and modell'd they naturally follow a distinct Interest nor can we reasonably expect a different Conduct from that Degree of Selfishness which is implanted in human Nature It requires very great Skill in a Legislator to prevent such Factions and many Philosophers are of Opinion that this Secret like the  Grand Elixir  or  Perpetual Motion  may amuse Men in Theory but can never possibly be reduc'd to Practice In despotick Governments indeed Factions often  do not appear but they are never the less real or rather they are more real and more pernicious upon that very Account The distinct Orders of Men Nobles and People Soldiers and Merchants have all a distinct Interest but the more Powerful oppresses the Weaker with Impunity and without Resistance which begets a seeming Tranquillity in such Governments  THERE has been an Attempt to divide the  landed  and  trading  Interest in  England  but without Success The Interest of these two Bodies is not really distinct and never will be so till our public Debts increase to such a Degree as to become altogether oppressive and intolerable  PARTIES from  Principles  especially abstract speculative Principles are known only to modern Times and are perhaps the most extraordinary and unaccountable  Phaenomena  that have ever yet appear'd in human Affairs Where different Principles beget a Contrariety of Conduct as all different political Principles do the Matter may be more easily explain'd A Man who esteems the true Right  of Government to ly in one Man or one Family cannot easily agree with his FellowCitizen who thinks that another Man or Family is possest of this Right Each naturally wishes that Right may take Place according to his own Notions of it But where the Difference of Principles begets no Contrariety of Action but each may follow his own Way without interfering with his Neighbour as happens in all religious Controversies what Madness what Fury can beget such unhappy and such fatal Divisions  TWO Men travelling on the Highway of whom one goes East the other West can easily pass each other if the Way be broad enough But two Men reasoning upon opposite Principles of Religion cannot so easily pass without shocking tho' one shou'd think that the Way were also in that Case sufficiently broad and that each might proceed without Interruption in his own Way But such is the Nature of the human Mind that it always takes hold of every Mind that approaches it and as it is wonderfully strengthen'd and corroborated by an Unanimity of Sentiments so it is shock'd and disturb'd by  any Contrariety Hence the Eagerness which most People discover in a Dispute hence their Impatience of Opposition even in the most speculative and indifferent Opinions  THIS Principle however frivolous it may appear seems to have been the Origin of all religious Wars and Divisions But as this Principle is universal in human Nature its Effects wou'd not have been confin'd to one Age and to one Sect of Religion did it not there concur with other more accidental Causes which raise it to such a Height as to cause the highest Misery and Devastation Most Religions of the antient World arose in the unknown Ages of Government when Men were as yet barbarous and uninstructed and the Prince as well as Peasant were dispos'd to receive with implicite Faith every pious Tale or Fiction that was offer'd them The Magistrate embrac'd the Religion of the People and entering cordially into the Care of sacred Matters naturally acquir'd an Authority in them and united the Ecclesiastical with the Civil Power But the  Christian  Religion arising while Principles directly opposite to it were firmly establish'd in the polite Part  of the World who despis'd the Nation that first broach'd this Novelty no Wonder that Christianity in such Circumstances was but little countenanc'd by the Civil Magistrate and that the Christian Priesthood were allowed to engross all the Authority in the new Sect So bad a Use did they make of this Power even in those early Times that the Perfecutions of Christianity may perhaps in Part be ascrib'd to the Violence instill'd by them into their Followers And the same Principles of Priestly Government continuing after Christianity became the establish'd Religion they have engender'd a Spirit of Persecution which has ever since been the Poison of human Society and the Source of the most inveterate Factions in every Government Such Factions therefore on the Part of the poor People may justly be esteem'd Factions of  Principle  but on the Part of the Priests who are the prime Movers they are really Factions of  Interest  THERE is another Cause beside the Authority of the Priests and the Separation of the Ecclesiastical and Civil Powers that has contributed to render  Christendom  the Scene  of religious Wars and Divisions Religions that arise in Ages totally ignorant and barbarous consist mostly of traditional Tales and Fictions which may be very different in every Sect without being contrary to each other and even when they are contrary every one adheres to the Tradition of his own Sect without much Reasoning or Disputation But as Philosophy was widely spread over the World at the Time that Christianity arose the Teachers of the new Sect were oblig'd to form a System of speculative Opinions to divide with some Accuracy their Articles of Faith and to explain comment confute and confirm with all the Subtility of Argument and Science From hence naturally arose Keenness in Dispute when Christianity came to be split into new Divisions and Heresies And this Keenness assisted the Priests in their pernicious Policy of begetting a mutual Hatred and Antipathy among their deluded Followers Sects of Philosophy in the antient World were more zealous than Parties of Religion but in modern Times Parties of Religion are more furious and enrag'd than the most cruel Factions that ever arose from Interest and Ambition  I HAVE mention'd Parties from  Affection  as a kind of  real  Parties beside those from  Interest  and  Principle  By Parties from Affection I understand those which are founded on the different Affections of Men towards particular Families and Persons whom they desire to rule over them These Parties are often very violent though I must own it is somewhat unaccountable that Men shou'd attach themselves so strongly to Persons whom they are no way acquainted with whom perhaps they never saw and from whom they never received nor can ever hope for any Favour Yet this we find often to be the Case and even with Men who on other Occasions discover no great Generosity of Spirit nor are found to be easily transported by Friendship beyond their own Interest We are apt I know not how to think the Relation betwixt us and our Sovereign very close and intimate The Splendor of Majesty and Power bestows an Importance on the Fortunes even of a single Person And when a Man's Goodnature does not give him this imaginary Interest his Illnature will do it from Spite and Opposition to Persons whose Sentiments are different from his own  ESSAY XI Of the PARTIES of GREATBRITAIN  WERE the  British  Government proposed as a Subject of Speculation to a studious Man he wou'd immediately perceive in it a Source of Division and Party which it wou'd be almost impossible for it in any Administration to avoid The just Ballance betwixt the Republican and Monarchical Part of our Constitution is really in itself so extreme delicate and uncertain that when join'd to Men's Passions and Prejudices 'tis impossible but different Opinions must arise concerning it even among Persons of the best Understanding Those of mild Tempers who love Peace and Order and detest Sedition and Civil Wars will always entertain more favourable Sentiments  of Monarchy than Men of bold Spirits who are passionate Lovers of Liberty and think no Evil comparable to Subjection and Slavery And though all reasonable Men agree in general to preserve our mixt Government yet when they come to Particulars some will incline to trust larger Powers to the Crown to bestow on it more Influence and to guard against its Encroachments with less Caution than others who are terrified at the most distant Approaches of Tyranny and despotic Power Thus there are Parties of PRINCIPLE involved in the very Nature of our Constitution which may properly enough be denominated  These Words have become of general Use and therefore I shall employ them without intending to express by them an universal Blame of the one Party or Approbation of the other The CourtParty may no doubt on some Occasions consult best the Interest of the Country and the CountryParty oppose it In like Manner the  Roman  Parties were denominated  Optimates  and  Populares  and  Cicero  like a true Partyman defines the  Optimates  to be such as in all their publick Conduct regulated themselves by the Sentiments of the best and worthiest of the  Romans Pro Sextio  The Term of  CountryParty  may afford a favourable Definition or Etymology of the same kind But it would be Folly to draw any Argument from that Head and I have no Regard to it in employing these Terms  COURT and COUNTRY Parties The  Strength and Violence of each of these Parties will much depend upon the particular Administration An Administration may be so bad as to throw a great Majority into the Country Party as a good Administration will reconcile to the Court many of the most passionate Lovers of Liberty But however the Nation may fluctuate betwixt these two Parties the Parties will always subsist as long as we are govern'd by a limited Monarchy  BUT besides this Difference of  Principle  those Parties are very much fomented by a Difference of INTEREST without which they cou'd scarce ever be dangerous or violent The Crown will naturally bestow all its Trust and Power upon those whose Principles real or pretended are most favourable to Monarchical Government and this Temptation will naturally engage them to go greater Lengths than their Principles wou'd otherwise carry them Their Antagonists who are disappointed in their ambitious Aims throw themselves into the Party whose Principles incline them to be most jealous of Royal Power and naturally carry those Principles to a greater Length than sound Politics will justify Thus the  Court  and  Country  Parties which are the genuine Factions of the  British  Government are a kind of mixt Parties and are influenced partly by Principle partly by Interest The Heads of the Parties are commonly most governed by the latter Motive the inferior Members of them by the former I must be understood to mean this of Persons who have any Motive for taking Party on any Side For to tell the Truth the greatest Part are commonly Men who associate themselves they know not why from Example from Passion from Idleness But still it is requisite there be some Source of Division either in Principle or Interest otherwise such Persons wou'd not find Parties to which they cou'd associate themselves  AS to Ecclesiastical Parties we may observe that in all Ages of the World Priests have been Enemies to Liberty and 'tis certain that this steady Conduct of theirs must have been founded on fixt Reasons of Interest and Ambition Liberty of thinking and of expressing our Thoughts is always fatal to Priestly Power and to those pious Frauds on which it is commonly founded and by  an infallible Connexion which is found among every Species of Liberty this Privilege can never be enjoy'd at least has never yet been enjoy'd but in a free Government Hence it must happen in such a Government as  Britain  that the establish'd Clergy will always be of the  Court  Party as on the contrary Dissenters of all kinds will be of the  Country  Party since they can never hope for that Toleration they stand in need of but by Means of our free Government All Princes that have aimed at despotic Power have known this important Interest of gaining the establish'd Clergy As the Clergy on their Side have shewn a great Facility of entering into the Views of such Princes  Gustavus Vaza  was perhaps the only ambitious Monarch that ever depress'd the Church at the same Time that he discouraged Liberty But the exorbitant Power of the Bishops in  Sweden  who at that Time overtop'd the Crown along with their Attachment to a foreign Family was the Reason of his embracing such an unusual Piece of Politics  THIS Observation concerning the Propensity of Clergymen to despotic Power and to  the Government of a single Person is not true with regard to one Sect only The  Presbyterian  and  Calvinistic  Clergy in  Holland  were always profess'd Friends to the Power of the Family of  Orange  as the  Arminians  who were esteem'd Heretics were always of the  Lovestein  Faction and zealous for Liberty But if a Prince has the Choice of both 'tis easy to see that he will prefer the Episcopal to the Presbyterian Form of Government both because of the greater Affinity betwixt Monarchy and Episcopacy and because of the Facility which a Prince finds in such a Government of ruling the Clergy by Means of their Ecclesiastical Superiors  IF we consider the first Rise of Parties in  England  during the Civil Wars we shall find that they were exactly conformable to this general Theory and that the Species of the Government gave Birth to them by a regular and infallible Operation The  English  Constitution before that Time had lain in a Kind of Confusion yet so as that the Subjects possess'd many noble Privileges which though not perhaps exactly bounded and secur'd by Law were universally deem'd from long  Possession to belong to them as their BirthRight An ambitious or rather an ignorant Prince arose who esteem'd all these Privileges to be Concessions of his Predecessors revocable at Pleasure and in Prosecution of this Principle he openly acted in Violation of Liberty during the Course of several Years Necessity at last constrain'd him to call a Parliament The Spirit of Liberty arose The Prince being without any Support was obliged to grant every Thing requir'd of him And his Enemies jealous and implacable set no Bounds to their Pretensions Here then begun those Contests in which it was no Wonder that Men of that Age were divided into different Parties since even at this Day the Impartial are at a Loss to decide concerning the Justice of the Quarrel The Pretensions of the Parliament if yielded to broke the Ballance of our Constitution by rendering the Government almost entirely Republican If not yielded to we were perhaps still in Danger of despotic Power from the settled Principles and inveterate Habits of the King which had plainly appear'd in every Concession that he had been constrain'd to make to his People In this Question so delicate  and uncertain Men naturally fell to the Side which was most conformable to their usual Principles and those who were the most passionate Favourers of Monarchy declar'd for the King as the zealous Friends of Liberty sided with the Parliament The Hopes of Success being nearly equal on both Sides  Interest  had little Influence in this Contest So that ROUNDHEAD and CAVALIER were merely Parties of Principle neither of which disown'd either Monarchy or Liberty but the former Party inclin'd most to the Republican Part of our Government and the latter to the Monarchial In which respect they may be consider'd as Court and CountryParty enflam'd into a Civil War by an unhappy Concurrence of Circumstances and by the turbulent Spirit of the Age The Commonwealth'sMen and the Partizans of despotic Power lay conceal'd in both Parties and form'd but an inconsiderable Part of them  THE Clergy had concurr'd in a shameless Manner with the King's arbitrary Designs according to their usual Maxims in such Cases And in Return were allow'd to persecute their Adversaries whom they call'd Heretics  and Schismatics The establish'd Clergy was Episcopal the Nonconformists Presbyterians So that all Things concurr'd to throw the former without Reserve into the King's Party and the latter into that of the Parliament The  Cavaliers  being the CourtParty and the  Roundheads  the CountryParty the Union was infallible betwixt the former and the establish'd Prelacy and betwixt the latter and Presbyterian Nonconformists This Union is so natural according to the general Principles of Politics that it requires some very extraordinary Concurrence of Circumstances to break it  EVERY one knows the Event of this Quarrel fatal to the King first and to the Parliament afterwards After many Confusions and Revolutions the Royal Family was at last restor'd and the Government establish'd on the same Footing as before  Charles  II was not made wiser by the dreadful Example of his Father but prosecuted the same Measures tho' with more Secrecy and Caution New Parties arose under the Appellations  WHIG and TORY which have continued ever since to confound and distract our Government  What the Nature is of these Parties is perhaps one of the most difficult Questions that can be met with and is a Proof that History may contain Problems as uncertain as any that are to be found in the most abstract Sciences We have seen the Conduct of these two Parties during the Course of Seventy Years in a vast Variety of Circumstances possess'd of Power and depriv'd of it during Peace and during War We meet with Persons who profess themselves of one Side or t'other every Hour in Company in our Pleasures in our serious Occupations We ourselves are constrain'd in a Manner to take Party and living in a Country of the highest Liberty every one may openly declare all his Sentiments and Opinions And yet we are at a Loss to tell the Nature Pretensions and Principles of the two Parties The Question is perhaps in itself somewhat difficult but has been render'd more so by the Prejudices and Violence of Party  WHEN we compare the Parties of  Whig  and  Tory  to those of  Roundhead  and  Cavalier  the most obvious Difference that appears betwixt them consists in the Doctrines  of  passive Obedience  and  indefeasible Right  which were but little heard of among the  Cavaliers  but became the universal Doctrine and was the true Characteristic of a  Tory  Were these Principles push'd into their most obvious Consequences they imply a formal Renunciation of all our Liberties and an Avowal of absolute Monarchy since nothing can be a greater Absurdity than a limited Power which must not be resisted even when it exceeds its Limitations But as the most rational Principles are often but a weak Counterpoise to Passion 'tis no Wonder that these absurd Principles  sufficient  according to a justly celebrated  Dissertation on Parties  Letter  d  Author  to shock the common Sense of a  HOTTENTOT  or  SAMOIEDE were found too weak for that Effect The  Tories  as Men were Enemies to Oppression and also as  Englishmen  they were Enemies to despotick Power Their Zeal for Liberty was perhaps less fervent than that of their Antagonists but was sufficient to make them forget all their general Principles when they saw themselves openly threaten'd with a Subversion of the antient Government  From these Sentiments arose the  Revolution  an Event of mighty Consequence and the firmest Foundation of  British  Liberty The Conduct of the  Tories  during that Event and after it will afford us a true Insight into the Nature of that Party  IN the  first  Place They appear to have had the Sentiments of true  Britons  in their Affection to Liberty and their determin'd Resolution not to sacrifice it to any abstract Principles whatsoever or to any imaginary Rights of Princes This Part of their Character might justly have been doubted of before the  Revolution  from the obvious Tendency of their avow'd Principles and from their almost unbounded Compliances with a Court that made little Secret of its arbitrary Designs The  Revolution  show'd them to have been in this Respect nothing but a genuine  CourtParty  such as might be expected in a  British  Government That is  Lovers of Liberty but greater Lovers of Monarchy  It must however be confest that they carry'd their monarchical Principles further even in Practice  but more so in Theory than was in any Degree consistent with a limited Government  Secondly  NEITHER their Principles nor Affections concurr'd with the Settlement made at the  Revolution  or with that which has since taken Place This Part of their Character may seem contradictory to the former since any other Settlement in those Circumstances of the Nation must have been dangerous if not fatal to Liberty But the Heart of Man is made to reconcile the most glaring Contradictions and this Contradiction abovemention'd is not greater than that betwixt  Passive Obedience  and the  Resistance  employ'd at the  Revolution  A  Tory  therefore since the  Revolution  may be defin'd in a few Words to be  a Lover of Monarchy tho' without abandoning Liberty and a Partizan of the Family of  STUART As a  Whig  may be defin'd to be  a Lover of Liberty tho' without renouncing Monarchy and a Friend to the Settlement in the  Protestant  Line  THE celebrated Writer above cited has asserted that the REAL Distinction betwixt  Whig  and  Tory  was lost at the  Revolution  and that  ever since they have continued to be mere  personal  Parties like the  Guelfs  and  Ghibbellines  after the Emperors had lost all Authority in  Italy  Such an Opinion were it received wou'd turn our whole History into an Aenigma and is indeed so contrary to the strongest Evidence that a Man must have a great Opinion of his own Eloquence to attempt the proving of it  I SHALL first mention as an irresistible Proof of a real Distinction betwixt these Parties what every one may have observ'd or heard concerning the Conduct and Conversation of all his Friends and Acquaintance on both Sides Have not the  Tories  always bore an avowed Affection to the Family of  Stuart  and have not their Adversaries always opposed with Vigour the Succession of that Family  THE  Tory  Principles are confessedly the most favourable to Monarchy Yet the  Tories  have almost always opposed the Court these fifty Years nor were they cordial Friends to King  William  even when employ'd by him Their Quarrel therefore cannot be supposed  to have lain with the Throne but with the Person who sat on it  THEY concurr'd heartily with the Court during the four last Years of Queen  Anne  But is any one at a loss to find the Reason  'TIS monstrous to see an establish'd Episcopal Clergy in declar'd Opposition to the Court and a Nonconformist Presbyterian Clergy in Conjunction with it What can produce such an unnatural Conduct in both Nothing but that the former have espoused Monarchical Principles too high for the present Settlement which is founded on Principles of Liberty And the latter being afraid of the Prevalence of those high Principles adhere to that Party from whom they have Reason to expect Liberty and Toleration  THE different Conduct of the two Parties with regard to foreign Politics is also a Proof to the same Purpose  Holland  has always been most favour'd by one and  France  by the other In short the Proofs of this kind are so palpable and evident that one is almost asham'd to collect them  A  Tory  is  a Lover of Monarchy though without abandoning Liberty and a Partizan of the Family of  STUART A  Whig  is  a Lover of Liberty though without renouncing Monarchy and a Friend to the Settlement in the  Protestant  Line  These different Views with regard to the Settlement of the Crown are accidental but natural Additions to the Principles of the  Court  and  Country  Parties which are the genuine Parties of the  British  Government A passionate Lover of Monarchy is apt to be displeased at any Change of this Succession as savouring too much of a Commonwealth A passionate Lover of Liberty is apt to think that every Part of the Government ought to be subordinate to the Interests of Liberty 'Tis however remarkable that though the Principles of  Whig  and  Tory  be both of them of a compound Nature yet the Ingredients which predominated in both were not correspondent to each other A  Tory  loved Monarchy and bore an Affection to the Family of  Stuart  but the latter Affection was the predominant Inclination of the Party A  Whig  loved Liberty and was a Friend to the Settlement in the  Potestant  Line but the Love of Liberty was professedly his predominant Inclination  The  Tories  have frequently acted as Republicans where either Policy or Revenge has engag'd them to that Conduct and there was none of that Party who upon the Supposition that they were to be disappointed in their Views with regard to the Succession would not have desired to impose the strictest Limitations on the Crown and to bring our Form of Government as near Republican as possible in order to depress the Family that according to their Apprehension succeeded without any just Title The  Whigs  'tis true have also taken Steps dangerous to Liberty under Pretext of securing the Succession and Settlement of the Crown according to their Views But as the Body of the Party had no Passion for that Succession otherwise than as the Means of securing Liberty they have been betray'd into these Steps by Ignorance or Frailty or the Interest of their Leaders The Succession of the Crown was therefore the chief Point with the  Tories  The Security of our Liberties with the  Whigs  'Tis Difficult to penetrate into the Thoughts and Sentiments of any particular Man but 'tis almost impossible to distinguish those of a  whole Party where it often happens that no two Persons agree precisely in the same Way of thinking Yet I will venture to affirm that it was not so much PRINCIPLE or an Opinion of indefeazible Right that attach'd the  Tories  to the antient Royal Family as AFFECTION or a certain Love and Esteem for their Persons The same Cause divided  England  formerly betwixt the Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  and  Scotland  betwixt the Families of  Bruce  and  Baliol  in an Age when political  Disputes  were but little in Fashion and when political  Principles  must of Course have had but little Influence on Mankind The Doctrine of passive Obedience is so absurd in itself and so opposite to our Liberties that it seems to have been chiefly left to Pulpit Declaimers and to their deluded Followers among the Mob Men of better Sense were guided by  Affection  and as to the Leaders of this Party it's probable that  Interest  was their sole Motive and that they acted more contrary to their private Sentiments than the Leaders of the opposite Party  SOME who will not venture to assert that the  real  Difference betwixt  Whig  and  Tory  was  lost at the  Revolution  seem inclin'd to think that the Difference is now abolish'd and that Affairs are so far return'd to their natural State that there are at present no other Parties amongst us but  Court  and  Country  that is Men who by Interest or Principle are attach'd either to Monarchy or to Liberty It must indeed be confest that the  Tory  Party has of late decay'd much in their Numbers still more in their Zeal and I may venture to say still more in their Credit and Authority There is no Man of Knowledge or Learning who wou'd not be asham'd to be thought of that Party and in almost all Companies the Name of OLD WHIG is mention'd as an uncontestable Appellation of Honour and Dignity Accordingly the Enemies of the Ministry as a Reproach call the Courtiers the true  Tories  and as an Honour denominate the Gentlemen in the  Opposition  the true  Whigs  The  Tories  have been so long oblig'd to talk in the Republican Stile that they seem to have made Converts of themselves by their Hypocrisy and to have embrac'd the Sentiments as well as Language of their Adversaries There are however very considerable Remains of that Party in  England  with all their old Prejudices and a demonstrative Proof that  Court  and  Country  are not our only Parties is that almost all the Dissenters side with the Court and the lower Clergy at least of the Church of  England  with the Opposition  ISHALL conclude this Subject with observing that we never had any  Tories  in  Scotland  according to the proper Signification of the Word and that the Division of Parties in this Country was really into  Whigs  and  Jacobites  A  Jacobite  seems to be a  Tory  who has no Regard to the Constitution but is either a zealous Partizan of absolute Monarchy or at least willing to sacrifice our Liberties to the obtaining the Succession in that Family to which he is attach'd The Reason of the Difference betwixt  England  and  Scotland  I take to be this Our political and our religious Divisions in this Country have been since the  Revolution  regularly correspondent to each other The  Presbyterians  were all  Whigs  without Exception The  Episcopalians  of the opposite Party And as the Clergy of the latter Sect were turn'd out of their Churches at the  Revolution  they had no Motive  to make any Compliances with the Government in their Oaths or Forms of Prayer but openly avow'd the highest Principles of their Party which is the Cause why their Followers have been more barefac'd and violent than their Brethren of the  Tory  Party in  England  As violent Things have not commonly so long a Duration as moderate we actually find that the  Jacobite  Party is almost entirely vanish'd from among us and that the Distinction of  Court  and  Country  which is but creeping in at  London  is the only one that is ever mention'd in this Kingdom Beside the Violence and Openness of the  Jacobite  Party another Reason has perhaps contributed to produce so sudden and so visible an Alteration in this Part of  Britain  There are only two Ranks of Men among us Gentlemen who have some Fortune and Education and the meanest slaving Poor without any considerable Number of that middling Rank of Men which abounds more in  England  both in Cities and in the Country than in any other Part of the World The slaving Poor are incapable of any Principles Gentlemen may be converted to true Principles by Time and Experience The middling Rank of  Men have Curiosity and Knowledge enough to form Principles but not enough to form true Ones or correct any Prejudices that they may have imbib'd And 'tis among the middling Rank of People that  Tory  Principles do at present prevail most in  England  ESSAY XII Of SUPERSTITION and ENTHUSIASM  THAT the Corruption of the best Things produces the worst  is grown into a Maxim and is verify'd among other Instances by the pernicious Effects of  Superstition  and  Enthusiasm  the Corruptions of true Religion  THESE two Species of false Religion tho' both pernicious yet are of a very different and even of a contrary Nature The Mind of Man is subject to certain unaccountable Terrors and Apprehensions proceeding either from the unhappy Situation of private or public Affairs from ill Health from a gloomy and melancholy Disposition or from the Concurrence of all these Circumstances In such  a State of Mind infinite unknown Evils are dreaded from unknown Agents and where real Objects of Terror are wanting the Soul active to its own Prejudice and fostering its predominant Inclination finds imaginary Ones to whose Power and Malevolence it sets no Limits As these Enemies are invisible and unknown the Methods taken to appease them are as unaccountable and consist in Ceremonies Observances Mortifications Sacrifices Presents or in any Practice however absurd and frivolous which either Folly or Knavery recommends to a blind and terrify'd Credulity Weakness Fear Melancholy along with Ignorance are therefore the true Sources of SUPERSTITION  BUT the Mind of Man is also subject to an unaccountable Elevation and Presumption proceeding from prosperous Success from luxuriant Health from strong Spirits and from a bold and confident Disposition In such a State of Mind the Imagination swells with great but confus'd Conceptions to which no sublunary Beauties or Enjoyments can correspond Every Thing mortal and perishable vanishes as unworthy of Attention  And a full Range is given to the Fancy in the invisible Regions or World of Spirits where the Soul is at Liberty to indulge itself in every Imagination that may best suit its present Taste and Disposition Hence arise Raptures Transports and surprizing Flights of Fancy and Confidence and Presumption still increasing these Raptures being altogether unaccountable and seeming quite beyond the Reach of our ordinary Faculties are attributed to the immediate Inspiration of that Divine Being who is the Object of Devotion In a little Time the inspir'd Person comes to regard himself as the chief Favourite of the Divinity and when this Frenzy once takes Place which is the Summit of Enthusiasm every Whimsy is consecrated Human Reason and even Morality are rejected as fallacious Guides And the fanatic Madman delivers himself over blindly and without Reserve to the suppos'd Illapses of the Spirit and to Inspirations from above Hope Pride Presumption warm Imagination along with Ignorance are therefore the true Sources of ENTHUSIASM  THESE two Species of false Religion might afford Occasion to many Speculations but I shall confine my self at present to a few Reflections concerning their different Influence on Government and Society  MY first Reflection is that Religions which partake of Enthusiasm are on their first Rise much more furious and violent than these which partake of Superstition but in a little Time become much more gentle and moderate The violence of this Species of Religion when excited by Novelty and animated by Opposition appears from numberless Instances of the  Anabaptists  in  Germany  the  Camisars  in  France  the  Levellers  and other Fanatics in  England  and the Covenanters in  Scotland  As Enthusiasm is founded on strong Spirits and a presumptuous Boldness of Character it naturally begets the most extreme Resolutions especially after it rises to that Height as to inspire the deluded Fanatics with the Opinion of Divine Illuminations and with a Contempt of the common Rules of Reason Morality and Prudence  'TIS thus Enthusiasm produces the most cruel Desolation in human Society But its Fury is like that of Thunder and Tempest which exhaust themselves in a little Time and leave the Air more calm and serene than before The Reason of this will appear evidently by comparing Enthusiasm to Superstition the other Species of false Religion and tracing the natural Consequences of each As Superstition is founded on Fear Sorrow and a Depression of Spirits it represents the Person to himself in such despicable Colours that he appears unworthy in his own Eyes of approaching the Divine Presence and naturally has Recourse to any other Person whose Sanctity of Life or perhaps Impudence and Cunning have made him be supposed to be more favoured by the Divinity To him they entrust their Devotions To his Care they recommend their Prayers Petitions and Sacrifices And by his Means hope to render their Addresses acceptable to their incensed Deity Hence the Origin of  By  Priests  I understand only the Pretenders to Power and Dominion and to a superior Sanctity of Character distinct from Virtue and good Morals These are very different from  Clergymen  who are set apart to the Care of sacred Matters and the Conducting our public Devotions with greater Decency and Order There is no Rank of Men more to be respected than the latter  PRIESTS who may justly be regarded  as proceeding from one of the grossest Inventions of a timorous and abject Superstition which ever diffident of itself dares not offer up its own Devotions but ignorantly thinks to recommend itself to the Divinity by the Mediation of his supposed Friends and Servants As Superstition is a considerable Ingredient of almost all Religions even the most fanatical there being nothing but Philosophy able to conquer entirely these unaccountable Terrors hence it proceeds that in almost every Sect of Religion there are Priests to be found But the stronger Mixture there is of Superstition the higher is the Authority of the Priesthood Modern Judaism and Popery especially the latter being the most barbarous and absurd Superstitions that have yet been known in the World are the most enslav'd by their Priests As the Church of  England  has a strong Mixture of Popish Superstition it partakes also in its original Constitution of a Propensity to Priestly Power and Dominion particularly in  the Respect it exacts to the Priest And tho' according to the Sentiments of that Church the Prayers of the Priest must be accompanied with those of the Laity yet is he the Mouth of the Congregation his Person is sacred and without his Presence few wou'd think their public Devotions or the Sacraments and other Rites acceptable to the Divinity  ON the other hand it may be observed that all Enthusiasts have been free from the Yoke of Ecclesiastics and have exprest a great Independence in their Devotion with a Contempt of Forms Traditions and Authorities The  Quakers  are the most egregious tho' at the same Time the most innocent Enthusiasts that have been yet known and are perhaps the only Sect that have never admitted Priests amongst them The  Independents  of all the  English  Sectaries approach nearest to the  Quakers  in Fanaticism and in their Freedom from Priestly Bondage The  Presbyterians  follow after at an equal Distance in both these Particulars In short this Observation is founded on the most certain Experience and will also appear to be founded on Reason if we consider that as Enthusiasm arises from a presumptuous  Pride and Confidence it thinks itself sufficiently qualified to  approach  the Divinity without any human Mediator Its rapturous Devotions are so servent that it even imagines itself  actually  to  approach  him by the Way of Contemplation and inward Converse which makes it neglect all those outward Ceremonies and Observances to which the Assistance of the Priest appears so requisite in the Eyes of their superstitious Votaries The Fanatic consecrates himself and bestows on his own Person a sacred Character much superior to what Forms and Ceremonious Institions can confer on any other  'TIS therefore an infallible Rule that Superstition is favourable to Priestly Power and Enthusiasm as much or rather more contrary to it than sound Reason and Philosophy The Consequences are evident When the first Fire of Enthusiasm is spent Men naturally in such fanatical Sects sink into the greatest Remissness and Coolness in Sacred Matters there being no Body of Men amongst them endow'd with sufficient Authority whose Interest is concern'd to support the religious Spirit Superstition on the contrary steals  in gradually and insensibly renders Men tame and submissive is acceptable to the Magistrate and seems inoffensive to the People Till at last the Priest having firmly establish'd his Authority becomes the Tyrant and Disturber of human Society by his endless Contentions Persecutions and religious Wars How smoothly did the  Romish  Church advance in their Acquisition of Power But into what dismal Convulsions did they throw all  Europe  in order to maintain it On the other Hand our Sectaries who were formerly such dangerous Bigots are now become our greatest Freethinkers and the  Quakers  are perhaps the only regular Body of  Deists  in the Universe except the  Literati  or Disciples of  Confucius  in  China  MY second Observation with regard to these Species of false Religion is That Superstition is an Enemy to Civil Liberty and Enthusiasm a Friend to it As Superstition groans under the Dominion of the Priests and Enthusiasm is an Enemy to all Ecclesiastical Power this sufficiently accounts for the present Observation Not to mention that Enthusiasm being the Infirmity of bold and  ambitious Tempers is naturally accompanied with a Spirit of Liberty as Superstition on the contrary renders Men tame and abject and fits them for Slavery We learn from the  English  History that during the Civil Wars the  Independents  and  Deists  tho' the most opposite in their religious Principles yet were united in their political Ones and were alike passionate for a Commonwealth And since the Origin of  Whig  and  Tory  the Leaders of the  VVhigs  have either been  Deists  or profest  Latudinarians  in their Principles that is Friends to Toleration and indifferent to any particular Sect of  Christians  While the Sectaries who have all a strong Tincture of Enthusiasm have always without Exception concurr'd with that Party in the Defence of Civil Liberty The Resemblance in their Superstitions long united the HighChurch  Tories  and the  Roman Catholics  in the Support of Prerogative and Kingly Power tho' Experience of the tolerating Spirit of the  VVhigs  seems of late to have reconcil'd the  Catholics  to that Party  THE  Molinists  and  Jansenists  in  France  have a Thousand unintelligible Disputes which are  not worthy the Attention of a Man of Sense But what principally distinguishes these two Sects and alone merits our Attention is the different Spirit of their Religion The  Molinists  conducted by the  Jesuites  are great Friends to Superstition rigid Observers of external Forms and Ceremonies and devoted to the Authority of the Priests and to Tradition The  Jansenists  are Enthusiasts and zealous Promoters of the passionate Devotion and of the inward Life little influenc'd by Authority and in a Word but Half Catholics The Consequences are exactly conformable to the foregoing Reasoning The  Jesuites  are the Tyrants and the Slaves of the Court And the  Jansenists  preserve alive the small Sparks of the Love of Liberty which are to be found in the  French  Nation  ESSAY XIII Of AVARICE  'TIS easy to observe That Comic Writers exaggerate every Character and draw their Fop or Coward with stronger Features than are any where to be met with in Nature This moral kind of Painting for the Stage has been often compar'd to the Painting for Cupolas and Ceilings where the Colours are overcharg'd and every Part is drawn excessively large and beyond Nature The Figures seem monstrous and disproportion'd when seen too nigh but become natural and regular when set at a Distance and placed in that Point of View in which they are intended to be survey'd After the same manner when Characters are exhibited in theatrical Representations the Want of Reality sets the Personages at a Distance from us and rendering them  more cold and unentertaining makes it necessary to compensate by the Force of Colouring what they want in Substance Thus we find in common Life That when a Man once allows himself to depart from Truth in his Narrations he never can keep within the Bounds of Probability but adds still some new Circumstance to render his Stories more marvellous and satisfy his Imagination Two Men in Buckram Suits became eleven to Sir  John Falstaff  before the End of his Story  THERE is only one Vice which may be found in Life with as strong Features and as high a Colouring as need be employ'd by any Satyrist or Comic Poet and that is AVARICE Every Day we meet with Men of immense Fortunes without Heirs and on the very Brink of the Grave who refuse themselves the most common Necessaries of Life and go on heaping Possessions on Possessions under all the real Pressures of the severest Poverty An old Usurer says the Story lying in his last Agonies was presented by the Priest with the Crucifix to worship He opens his Eyes a Moment before he expires considers the Crucifix and cries  These Jewels  are not true I can only lend ten Pistoles upon such a Pledge  This was probably the Invention of some Epigrammatist and yet every one from his own Experience may be able to recollect almost as strong Instances of Perseverance in Avarice 'Tis commonly reported of a famous Miser in this City that finding himself near Death he sent for some of the Magistrates and gave them a Bill of an hundred Pounds payable after his Decease which Sum he intended should be disposed of in charitable Uses but scarce were they gone when he orders them to be called back and offers them ready Money if they would abate five Pounds of the Sum Another noted Miser in the North intending to defraud his Heirs and leave his Fortune to the Building an Hospital protracted the drawing of his Will from Day to Day and 'tis thought that if those interested in it had not paid for the Drawing of it he would have died intestate In short none of the most furious Excesses of Love and Ambition are in any respect to be compared to the Extremes of Avarice  THE best Excuse that can be made for Avarice is That it generally prevails in old Men or in Men of cold Tempers where all the other Affections are extinct and the Mind being incapable of remaining without some Passion or Pursuit at last finds out this monstrous unreasonable one which suits the Coldness and Inactivity of its Temper At the same Time it seems very extraordinary that so frosty spiritless a Passion shou'd be able to carry us farther than all the Warmth of Youth and Pleasure But if we look more narrowly into the Matter we shall find that this very Circumstance renders the Explication of the Case more easy When the Temper is warm and full of Vigour it naturally shoots out more Ways than one and produces inferior Passions to counterbalance in some Degree its predominant Inclination 'Tis impossible for a Person of that Temper however bent on any Pursuit to be depriv'd of all Sense of Shame or Regard to the Sentiments of Mankind His Friends must have some Influence over him And other Considerations are apt to have their Weight All this serves to restrain him within some Bounds But 'tis no Wonder the avaritious Man being from the  Coldness of his Temper without regard to Reputation to Friendship or to Pleasure shou'd be carried so far by his prevailing Inclination and shou'd display his Passion in such surprizing Instances  ACCORDINGLY we find no Vice so irreclaimable as Avarice And tho' there scarcely has been a Moralist or Philosopher from the Beginning of the World to this Day who has not levell'd a Stroke at it we hardly find a single Instance of any Person's being cur'd of it For this Reason I am more apt to approve of those who attack it with Wit and Humour than of those who treat it in a serious Manner There being so little Hopes of doing Good to the People infected with this Vice I would have the rest of Mankind at least diverted by our Manner of exposing it As indeed there is no Kind of Diversion of which they seem so willing to partake  AMONG the Fables of  Monsieur de la Motte  there is one levell'd against Avarice which seems to me more natural and easy than most of the Fables of that ingenious Author A Miser says he being dead and fairly interred  came to the Banks of the  Styx  desiring to be ferry'd over along with the other Ghosts  Charon  demands his Fare and is surpriz'd to see the Miser rather than pay it throw himself into the River and swim over to the other Side notwithstanding all the Clamour and Opposition that cou'd be made to him All Hell was in an Uproar and each of the Judges was meditating some Punishment suitable to a Crime of such dangerous Consequence to the infernal Revenues Shall he be chain'd to the Rock along with  Prometheus  Or tremble below the Precipice in Company with the  Dana√Ødes  Orassist  Sisyphus  in rolling his Stone No says  Minos  None of these We must invent some severer Punishment Let him be sent back to the Earth to see the Use his Heirs are making of his Riches  I HOPE it will not be interpreted as a Design of setting myself in Opposition to this famous Author if I proceed to deliver a Fable of my own which is intended to expose the same Vice of Avarice The Hint of it was taken from these Lines of Mr  Pope  Damn'd to the Mines an equal Fate betides  The Slave that digs it and the Slave that hides  OUR old Mother EARTH once laid an Indictment against AVARICE before the Courts of Heaven for her wicked and malicious Counsel and Advice in tempting inducing perswading and traiterously seducing the Children of the Plaintiff to commit the detestable Crime of Parricide upon her and mangling her Body in ransacking her very Bowels for hidden Treasure The Indictment was very long and verbose but we must omit a great Part of the Repetitions and Synonimous Terms Not to tire our Reader too much with our Tale  Avarice  being call'd before  Jupiter  to answer to this Charge had not much to say in her own Defence The Injury was clearly prov'd upon her The Fact indeed was notorious and the Injury had been frequently repeated When therefore the Plaintiff demanded Justice  Jupiter  very readily gave Sentence in her Favour and his Decree was to this Purpose That since Dame  Avarice  the Defendant had thus grievously injur'd Dame  Earth  the Plaintiff she was hereby order'd to take that Treasure of which she had feloniously robb'd the said Plaintiff by ransacking her Bosom and in the same Manner as before opening her Bosom restore  it back to her without Diminution or Retention From this Sentence it shall follow says  Jupiter  to the Bystanders That in all future Ages the Retainers of  Avarice  shall bury and conceal their Riches and thereby restore to the  Earth  what they took from her  ESSAY XIV Of the DIGNITY of HUMAN NATURE  THERE are certain Sects which secretly form themselves in the learned World as well as in the political and tho' sometimes they come not to an open Rupture yet they give a different Turn to the Ways of thinking of those who have taken Party on either Side The most remarkable of this Kind are the Sects that are founded on the different Sentiments with regard to the  Dignity of human Nature  which is a Point that seems to have divided Philosophers and Poets as well as Divines from the Beginning of the World to this Day Some exalt our Species to the Skies and represent Man as a Kind of human DemiGod that derives his Origin from Heaven and retains evident  Marks of his Lineage and Descent Others insist upon the blind Sides of human Nature and can discover nothing except Vanity in which Man surpasses the other Animals whom he affects so much to despise If an Author possesses the Talent of Rhetoric and Declamation he commonly takes Party with the former If his Turn lies towards Irony and Ridicule he naturally throws himself into the other Extreme  I AM far from thinking that all those who have depreciated Human Nature have been Enemies to Virtue and have exposed the Frailties of their FellowCreatures with any bad Intention On the contrary I am sensible that a very delicate Sense of Virtue especially when attended with somewhat of the  Misanthrope  is apt to give a Man a Disgust of the World and to make him consider the common Course of Human Affairs with too much Spleen and Indignation I must however be of Opinion that the Sentiments of those who are inclined to think favourably of Mankind are much more advantageous to Virtue than the contrary Principles which give us a mean Opinion of our Nature When a Man  is possess'd of a high Notion of his Rank and Character in the Creation he will naturally endeavour to act up to it and will scorn to do a base or vicious Action which might sink him below that Figure which he makes in his own Imagination Accordingly we find That all our polite and fashionable Moralists insist upon this Topic and endeavour to represent Vice as unworthy of Man as well as odious in itself  WOMEN are generally much more flatter'd in their Youth than Men which may proceed from this Reason among others that their chief Point of Honour is consider'd as much more difficult than ours and requires to be supported by all that decent Pride which can be instill'd into them  WE find very few Disputes that are not founded on some Ambiguity in the Expression and I am perswaded that the present Dispute concerning the Dignity of Human Nature is not more exempt from it than any other It may therefore be worth while to consider what is real and what is only verbal in this Controversy  THAT there is a natural Difference betwixt Merit and Demerit Virtue and Vice Wisdom and Folly no reasonable Man will deny But yet 'tis evident that in affirming the Term which denotes either our Approbation or Blame we are commonly more influenced by Comparison than by any fixt unalterable Standard in the Nature of Things In like manner Quantity and Extension and Bulk are by every one acknowledg'd to be real Things But when we call any Animal  great  or  little  we always form a secret Comparison betwixt that Animal and others of the same Species and 'tis that Comparison which regulates our Judgment concerning its Greatness A Dog and a Horse may be of the very same Size while the one is admir'd for the Greatness of its Bulk and the other for the Smallness When I am present therefore at any Dispute I always consider with myself whether or not it be a Question merely of Comparison that is the Subject of the Dispute and if it be whether the Disputants compare the same Objects together or talk of Things that are widely different As this is commonly the Case I have long since learnt to neglect such Disputes as  manifest Abuses of Leisure the most valuable Present that cou'd be made to Mortals  IN forming our Notions of Human Nature we are very apt to make a Comparison betwixt Men and Animals which are the only Creatures endowed with Thought that fall under our Senses Certainly this Comparison is very favourable to Mankind On the one hand we see a Creature whose Thoughts are not limited by any narrow Bounds either of Place or Time who carries his Researches into the most distant Regions of this Globe and beyond this Globe to the Planets and Heavenly Bodies looks backward to consider the first Origin of Human Race casts his Eyes forward to see the Influence of his Actions upon Posterity and the Judgments that will be form'd of his Character a thousand Years hence A Creature that traces Causes and Effects to a great Length and Intricacy extracts general Principles from particular Appearances improves upon his Discoveries corrects his Mistakes and makes his very Errors profitable On the other hand we are presented with a Creature the very reverse of this limited in its Observations and Reasonings to a few sensible Objects  that surround it without Curiosity without Foresight blindly conducted by Instinct and arriving in a very short Time at its utmost Perfection beyond which it is never able to advance a single Step What a wide Difference is there betwixt these Creatures And how exalted a Notion must we entertain of the former in Comparison of the latter  THERE are two Means commonly employ'd to destroy this Conclusion  First  By making an unfair Representation of the Case and insisting only upon the Weaknesses of Human Nature And  secondly  By forming a new and secret Comparison betwixt Man and Beings of the most perfect Wisdom Among the other Excellencies of Man there is this remarkable that he can form a Notion of Perfections much beyond what he has Experience of in himself and is not limited in his Conception of Wisdom and Virtue He can easily exalt his Notions and conceive a Degree of Wisdom which when compar'd to his own will make the latter appear very contemptible and will cause the Difference betwixt that and the Sagacity of Animals in a manner to disappear and vanish Now this being a Point in which  all the World is agreed that Human Understanding falls infinitely short of perfect Wisdom 'tis proper we should know when this Comparison takes Place that we may not dispute where there is no real Difference in our Sentiments Man falls much more short of perfect Wisdom and even of his own Ideas of perfect Wisdom than Animals do of Man but yet the latter Difference is so considerable that nothing but a Comparison with the former can make it appear of little Moment  'TIS also very usual to  compare  one Man with another and finding very few that we can call  wise  or  virtuous  we are apt to entertain a contemptible Notion of our Species in general That we may be sensible of the Fallacy of this Way of Reasoning we may observe that the Honourable Appellations of wise and virtuous are not annex'd to any particular Degree of those Qualities of  Wisdom  and  Virtue  but arise altogether from the Comparison we make betwixt one Man and another When we find a Man who arrives at such a Pitch of Wisdom as is very uncommon we pronounce him a wise Man So that  to say there are few wise Men in the World is really to say nothing since 'tis only by their Scarcity that they merit that Appellation Were the lowest of our Species as wise as  Tully  or my Lord  Bacon  we should still have Reason to say that there are few wise Men For in that Case we should exalt our Notions of Wisdom and wou'd not pay a singular Honour to any one that was not singularly distinguish'd by his Talents In like Manner I have heard it observ'd by thoughtless People that there are few Women possest of Beauty in Comparison of those who want it not considering that we bestow the Epithet of  Beautiful  only on such as possess a Degree of Beauty that is common to them with a few The same Degree of Beauty in a Woman is call'd Deformity which is treated as real Beauty in one of our Sex  AS 'tis usual in forming a Notion of our Species to  compare  it with the other Species above or below it or to compare the Individuals of the Species among themselves so we often compare together the different Motives or actuating Principles of Human Nature in order to regulate our Judgment concerning  it And indeed this is the only Kind of Comparison that is worth our Attention or decides any Thing in the present Question Were the selfish and vicious Principles of Human Nature so much predominant above the Social and Virtuous as is asserted by some Philosophers we ought undoubtedly to entertain a contemptible Notion of Human Nature I may perhaps treat more fully of this Subject in some future Speculation In the mean Time I shall observe what has been prov'd beyond Question by several great Moralists of the present Age that the social Passions are by far the most powerful of any and that even all the other Passions receive their Force and Influence from them Whoever desires to see this Question treated at large with the greatest Force of Argument and Eloquence may consult my Lord  Shaftsbury  's Enquiry concerning Virtue  IN my Opinion there are two Things which have led astray those Philosophers that have insisted so much on the Selfishness of Man In the  First  Place they found that every Act of Virtue or Friendship was attended with a secret Pleasure From whence they  concluded that Friendship and Virtue could not be disinterested But the Fallacy of this is obvious The virtuous Sentiment or Passion produces the Pleasure and does not arise from it I feel a Pleasure in doing good to my Friend because I love him but do not love him for the sake of that Pleasure  IN the  second  Place it has always been found that virtuous Men are far from being indifferent to Praise and therefore they have been represented as a Set of vainglorious Men that had nothing in View but the Applauses of others But this also is a Fallacy 'Tis very unjust in the World when they find any Tincture of Vanity in a laudable Action to depreciate it upon that Account or ascribe it entirely to that Motive The Case is not the same with Vanity as with other Passions Where Avarice or Revenge enters into any seemingly virtuous Action 'tis difficult for us to determine how far it enters and 'tis natural to suppose it the sole actuating Principle But Vanity is so nearly ally'd to Virtue and to love the Fame of virtuous Actions approaches so near the Love of virtuous Actions for their own sake that these Passions are more capable  of Mixture than any other kinds of Passion and 'tis almost impossible to have the latter without some Degree of the former Accordingly we find that this Passion for Glory is always warp'd and varied according to the particular Taste or Sentiment of the Mind on which it falls  Nero  had the same Vanity in driving a Chariot that  Trajan  had in governing the Empire with Justice and Ability To love the Glory of virtuous Actions is a sure Proof of the Love of virtuous Actions  ESSAY XV Of LIBERTY and DESPOTISM  THOSE who employ their Pens on political Subjects free from PartyRage and PartyPrejudices cultivate a Science which of all others contributes most both to public Utility and to the private Satisfaction of those who addict themselves to the Study of it I am apt however to entertain a Suspicion that the World is still too young to fix any general stable Truths in Politics which will remain true to the latest Posterity We have not as yet had Experience of above three thousand Years so that not only the Art of Reasoning is still defective in this Science as well as in all others but we even want sufficient Materials upon which we can reason 'Tis not sufficiently known what Degrees of Refinement either in Virtue  or Vice human Nature is susceptible of nor what may be expected of Mankind from any great Revolution in their Education Customs or Principles  Machiavel  was certainly a great Genius but having confin'd his Study to the furious Tyranny of  antient  Sovereigns or the little disorderly Principalities of  Italy  his Reasonings especially upon Monarchical Government have been found extremely defective and there scarce is any Maxim in his  Prince  which subsequent Experience has not entirely refuted  A weak Sovereign  says he  is incapable of receiving good Counsel for if he consult with several he will not be able to choose among their different Counsels If he abandon himself to one that Minister may perhaps have Capacity but he will not be long a Minister He will be sure to dispossess his Master and place himself and his own Family upon the Throne  I mention this among innumerable Instances of the Errors of that Politician proceeding from his having liv'd in too early an Age of the World to be a good Judge of political Truth Almost all the Princes of  Europe  are at present governed by their Ministers and have been so for near two Centuries and yet no such Event  has ever happen'd or can possibly happen  Sejanus  might project the dethroning the  Caesars  but  Fleury  though ever so vicious could not while in his Senses entertain the least Hopes of dispossessing the  Bourbons  TRADE was never esteem'd an Affair of State 'till within this last Century nor is there any antient Writer on Politics who has made mention of it Even the  Italians  have kept a profound Silence with regard to it though it has now excited the chief Attention as well of Ministers of State as of speculative Reasoners The great Opulence Grandeur and military Archievements of the two Maritime Powers seem first to have instructed Mankind in the vast Importance of an extensive Commerce  HAVING therefore intended in this Essay to have made a full Comparison of Liberty and Despotism and have shown the Advantages and Disadvantages of each I began to entertain a Suspicion that no Man in this Age was sufficiently qualified for such an Undertaking and that whatever he should advance on that Head would in all Probability be refuted by further  Experience and be rejected by Posterity Such mighty Revolutions have happened in human Affairs and so many Events have arisen contrary to the Expectation of the antients as are sufficient to beget the Suspicion of still farther Changes  IT had been observ'd by the Antients that all the Arts and Sciences arose among free Nations and that the  Persians  and  Egyptians  notwithstanding all their Ease Opulence and Luxury made but faint Efforts towards a Relish in those finer Pleasures which were carried to such Perfection by the  Greeks  amidst continual Wars attended with Poverty and the greatest Simplicity of Life and Manners It had also been observ'd that as soon as the  Greeks  lost their Liberty tho' they encreased mightily in Riches by Means of the Conquests of  Alexander  yet the Arts from that Moment declin'd among them and have never since been able to raise their Head in that Climate Learning was transplanted to  Rome  the only free Nation at that Time in the Universe and having met with so favourable a Soil it made prodigious Shoots for above a Century till the Decay of Liberty produced  also the Decay of Letters and spread a total Barbarity over the World From these two Experiments of which each was double in its Kind and show'd the Fall of Learning in Despotic Governments as well as its Rise in popular Ones  Longinus  thought himself sufficiently justified in asserting That the Arts and Sciences could never flourish but in a free Government And in this Opinion he has been followed by several eminent Writers  Mr  Addison  and my Lord  Shaftsbury  in our own Country who either confin'd their View merely to antient Facts or entertain'd too great a Partiality in Favour of that Form of Government which is establish'd amongst us  BUT what would these Writers have said to the Instance of modern  Rome  and  Florence  of which the former carried to Perfection all the finer Arts of Sculpture Painting and Music as well as Poetry tho' they groah'd under Slavery and under the Slavery of Priests While the latter never made any Efforts towards the Arts and Sciences till they began to lose their Liberty by the Usurpations of the  Family of the  Medicis Ariosto Tasso Galilaeo  no more than  Raphael  or  Michael Angelo  were not born in Republics And tho' the  Lombard  School was famous as well as the  Roman  yet the  Venetians  have had the smallest Share in its Honours and seem rather inferior to the other  Italians  in their Genius for the Sciences  Rubens  establish'd his School at  Antwerp  not at  Amsterdam Dresden  not  Hamburg  is the Centre of Politeness in  Germany  BUT the most eminent Instance of the flourishing of Learning in despotic Governments is that of FRANCE which never enjoy'd any Shadow of Liberty and yet has carried the Arts and Sciences nearer Perfection than any other Nationa of the Universe The  English  are perhaps better Philosophers the  Italians  better Painters and Musicians the  Romans  were better Orators But the  French  are the only People except the  Greeks  who have been at once Philosophers Poets Orators Historians Painters Architects Sculptors and Musicians With regard to the Stage they have far excell'd the  Greeks  And in common Life have in a great Measure perfected  that Art the most useful and agreeable of any  l'Art de Vivre  the Art of Society and Conversation  IF we consider the State of the Sciences and polite Arts in our own Country  Horace  's Observation with regard to the  Romans  may in a great Measure be applied to the  British  Sed in longum tamen aevum  Manserunt hodieque manent  vestigia ruris  THE Elegance and Propriety of Stile have been very much neglected among us We have no Dictionary of our Language and scarce a tolerable Grammar The first polite Prose we have was wrote by a Man  Doctor  Swift  who is still alive As to  Sprat Temple  and  Locke  they knew too little of the Rules of Art to be esteem'd elegant Writers The Prose of  Bacon Harrington  and  Milton  is altogether stiff and pedantic tho' their Sense be excellent Men in this Country have been so much occupied in the Grand Disputes of  Religion Politics  and  Philosophy  that they had  no Relish for the minute Observations of Grammar and Criticism And tho' this Turn of Thinking must have considerably improv'd our Sense and Talent of Reasoning beyond that of other Nations yet it must be confest that even in these Sciences we have not any StandardBook which we can transmit to Posterity And the utmost we have to boast of are a few faint Efforts towards a more just Philosophy which indeed promise very much but have not as yet reach'd any Degree of Perfection  IT has become an establish'd Opinion That Commerce can never flourish but in a free Government and this Opinion seems to have been founded on a longer and larger Experience than the foregoing with Regard to the Arts and Sciences If we trace Commerce in its Progress thro'  Tyre Athens Syracuse Carthage Venice Florence Genoa Antwerp Holland England  c we shall always find it to have fixt its Seat in free Governments The three greatest trading Towns now in the World are  London Amsterdam  and  Hamburgh  all free Cities and Protestant Cities that is enjoying a double Liberty It must  however be observ'd that the great Jealousy entertain'd of late with regard to the Commerce of  France  seems to prove that this Maxim is no more certain and infallible than the foregoing and that the Subjects of absolute Princes may become our Rivals in Commerce as well as in Learning  DURST I deliver my Opinion in an Affair of so much Uncertainty I would assert That notwithstanding the Efforts of the  French  there is something pernicious to Commerce inherent in the very Nature of absolute Government and inseparable from it Tho' the Reason I would assign for this Opinion is somewhat different from that which is commonly insisted on Private Property seems to me fully as secure in a civiliz'd  Europaean  Monarchy as in a Republic nor is any Danger ever apprehended in such a Government from the Violence of the Sovereign no more than we commonly apprehend Danger from Thunder or Earthquakes or any Accident the most unusual and extraordinary Avarice the Spur of Industry is so obstinate a Passion and works its Way thro' so many real Dangers and Difficulties that 'tis not likely  it will be scarr'd by an imaginary Danger which is so small that it scarce admits of Calculation Commerce therefore in my Opinion is apt to decay in absolute Governments not because it is there less  secure  but because it is less  honourable  A Subordination of Ranks is absolutely necessary to the Support of Monarchy Birth Titles and Place must be honour'd above Industry and Riches And while these Notions prevail all the considerable Traders will be tempted to throw up their Commerce in order to purchase some of these Employments to which Privileges and Honours are annex'd  SINCE I am upon this Head of the Alterations that Time has produc'd or may produce in Politics I must observe That all Kinds of Government free and despotic seem to have undergone in modern Times a great Change to the better with regard both to foreign and domestic Management The  Balance of Power  is a Secret in Politics known only to the present Age and I must add That the internal POLICE of the State has also receiv'd great Improvements within this last Century We are inform'd by  Sallust  That  Cataline  's Army was much augmented by the Accession of the Highwaymen about  Rome  tho' I believe that all of that Profession who are at present dispers'd over  Europe  would not amount to a Regiment In  Cicero  's Pleadings for  Milo  I find this Argument among others made Use of to prove that his Client had not assassinated  Clodius  Had  Milo  says he intended to have kill'd  Clodius  he had not attack'd him in the Daytime and at such a Distance from the City He had Waylaid him at Night near the Suburbs where it might have been pretended that he was kill'd by Robbers and the Frequency of the Accident would have favour'd the Deceit This is a surprizing Proof of the loose Police of  Rome  and of the Number and Force of these Robbers since  Clodius  as we learn from the same Oration was at that Time attended with Sixty Slaves who were compleatly arm'd and by the  Roman  Laws answerable upon their own Lives for the Life of their Master  BUT tho' all Kinds of Government be much improv'd in modern Times yet Monarchical Government seems to have receiv'd the most considerable Improvements It may now be  affirm'd of civiliz'd Monarchies what was formerly said in Praise of Republics alone  that they are a Government of Laws not of Men  They are found susceptible of Order Method and Constancy to a surprizing Degree Property is secure Industry encourag'd the Arts flourish and the Prince lives secure among his Subjects like a Father among his Children It must however be confest that tho' Monarchical Governments have approach'd nearer to popular Ones in Gentleness and Stability yet they are still much inferior Our modern Education and Customs instil more Humanity and Moderation than the antient but have not as yet been able to overcome entirely the Disadvantages of that Form of Government  BUT here I must beg leave to advance a Conjecture which seems to me very probable but which Posterity alone can fully judge of I am apt to think that in Monarchical Governments there is a Source of Improvement and in Popular Governments a Source of Degeneracy which in Time will bring these Species of Government still nearer an Equality The greatest Abuses which arise in  France  the most perfect Model of pure Monarchy proceed not from the Number or Weight of the Taxes beyond what are to be met with in free Countries but from the Expensive unequal arbitrary and intricate Method of levying them by which the Industry of the Poor especially of the Peasants and Farmers is in a great Measure discourag'd and Agriculture render'd a beggarly and a slavish Employment But to whose Advantage do these Abuses serve If to that of the Nobility they might be esteem'd inherent in that Form of Government since the Nobility are the true Supports of Monarchy and 'tis natural their Interest should be more consulted in such a Constitution than that of the People But the Nobility are in reality the principal Losers by this Oppression since it ruins their Estates and beggars their Tenants The only Gainers by it are the  Finan√ßiers  a Race of Men despised and hated by the Nobility and the whole Kingdom If a Prince or Minister therefore should arise endow'd with sufficient Discernment to know his own and the public Interest and of sufficient Force of Mind to break thro' antient Customs we may expect to see these Abuses remedied in which Case the  Difference betwixt their absolute Government and our free one would be more nominal than real  The Source of Degeneracy that may be remark'd in free Governments consists in the Practice of contracting Debt and mortaging the public Revenues by which Taxes may in Time become altogether intolerable and all the Property of the State be brought into the Hands of the Public This Practice is of modern Date The  Athenians  though a Republic paid Twenty  per Cent  for Money as we learn from  Xenophon  Among the Moderns the  Dutch  first introduced the Practice of borrowing great Sums at low Interest and have well nigh ruined themselves by it Absolute Princes have also contracted Debt but as an Absolute Prince may play the Bankrupt when he pleases his People can never be opprest by his Debts In popular Governments the People and chiefly those who have the highest Offices being always the public Creditors 'tis impossible the State can ever make use of this Remedy which however it may be sometimes necessary is always cruel and barbarous This therefore seems to be an  Inconvenience that nearly threatens all free Governments especially our own at the present Juncture of Affairs And what a strong Motive is this to encrease our Frugality of the public Money left for want of it we be reduced by the Multiplicity of Taxes to curse our free Government and wish ourselves in the same State of Servitude with all the Nations that surround us  FINIS
