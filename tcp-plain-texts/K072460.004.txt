walking in a wood that bordered on his father's ga  en Now this wood was formed of little trees placed very near each other and two paths conducting through it crossed One day as he was sauntering up and down he wished to rest himself a little with his back supported by a tree whose stem was yet quite slender and which therefore shook through all its branches when his body first touched it As it chanced the rustling frighted a poor little bird which flew out of a neighbouring bush and soon disappeared  George saw it fly away and was vexed He fixed his eye upon the bush to see if it would not return and while he was attentively considering it he thought he saw among the branches at a spot where they were twisted into one another something like a tuft of hay His curiosity induced him to draw nearer and examine it He found this tuft of hay was hollow like a porringer he thrust aside the branches and saw certain little balls within it of an oval shape and spotted They were placed beside each other on a layer of grass Sure this said George must be what I have heard some people call a bird's nest and the balls are eggs They are indeed quite little but the bird is not so big as any of our hens  It was his first design to carry away the nest however upon second thoughts he was contented with one egg and having taken it ran home He met his sister by the way and thus addressed her "See this little egg I found it in a nest there were five others with it" "Let me have it in my hand" said George's sister She examines it returns it to her brother and then asks a second time to have it In the end they roll it up and down a  table just as if it were a ball One shoves it one way and the other pushes it another way till in the midst of their diversion it falls down and breaks They cry and mutually accuse each other as the cause of such a great misfortune  As it chanced their mother hears them thus complaining and not knowing why they weep approaches to conso  e them Both begin at once She hears their different stories and then taking each affectionately by the hand conducts them to a tree that overshadowed a green bank on which she bids them both sit down  Be comforted dear children said she That you have broke the egg between you both is truly a misfortune but it is one however that should not much grieve you since you did not mean to do so I might notwithstanding blame you George with justice for the act of having brought it from the nest You must have seen hen's eggs disposed of in a sort of nest The mother sits on warms and animates them Chickens in about three weeks are formed within them and they pierce the shell In some sew days they come and feed out of your hand This egg would also have become a sort of chick which you have killed by bringing it away The bird that flew out of the bush as you inform me was the mother Doubtless she will come again and very shortly to her nest she will perceive that one egg is wanting and perhaps forsake it altogether This is frequently the case  Perhaps this loss of but a single egg informs them that their asylum is discovered they have every thing to fear from our violence they guess that when their little ones are hatched he who has already robbed them will return and seize upon their tender family If then this nest which you have been thus robbing as I must call it should be totally abandonedtell me would you not be sorry for it  Yes mama indeed replied little George and I am sorry that I meddled with the egg but then I did not know a syllable of what you have been telling us and thought no harm in bringing it to shew my sister which is all that I meant to do  My little fellow I can easily believe you said the mother Should you do bad actions for the pleasure which some suppose there is in doing them you would in that  case have a very wicked heart and I should be quite sorry that I had such a son but that I do not fear for on the contrary I know you to be a very good boy  Mama said the little girl the nest for I have seen it out of which my brother took this egg does not resemble in the least those swallows nests that we see about our outhouse roof My dear child said the mother every nest is not alike nor yet is every bird alike for some are great and others little Some are never known to perch on trees and others live at all times in them Some are large and stupid others small and full of industry and cunning Some are beautiful beyond description in their plumage which has half a dozen colours others are of one dull colour Some subsist on fruits some go in quest of insects and a multitude of others seize on smaller birds and eat them  Ah the wicked creatures cried the little girl I do not love these last and should be glad to spoil their nests So too would many others said her mama and therefore those great birds that constantly devour the less construct their nests in places where they cannot easily be come at as for instance in woods and in the holes of rocks where men appear but very seldom and at heights beyond our reach however skilful we may be in climbing  Therefore dearest children since these birds are greatly different from each other not only in size but also in their way of life and in the colour of their feathers it is but reasonable that they should have nests different also from each other Thus the lark which never lives in any tree but sings as you have heard her mounting in the air constructs her nest upon the ground the swallow builds about the roofs of houses under what we call the eaves the owl which people only hear by night seeks out old ruinous buildings or some hollow tree to put her eggs in and the eagle which I shewed you yesterday flying above the clouds and nearly out of sight brings forth her young ones in the cliffs of craggy rocks Those living round about us make their nests in trees and hedges Those that love the water and who find their food therein build theirs among those rushes that grow  near it upon little islands and at times upon the shore itself  If one of these fine days we go into the little valley at the bottom of our large meadow we shall see a number of these little creatures busy in selecting the materials they compose their nests of One you will observe employed in carrying off a wheaten straw another will have in his beak some wool or feathers or dried leaves and very probably a third some moss The swallow by the border of a stream you will take notice moistens with the water which he takes up in his beak a little bit of earth with which he builds his habitation Such materials as are very coarse and solid he will take to form the outside of his nest but lines it with the softest and the warmest Nay there are some birds who pull out their own feathers to make up a more comfortable bed for their little ones  They construct large nests or small ones in proportion to the number of young birds that they are to hatch within them Some will hang their nests up by a sort of thread which thread they have the skill to form of flax of different sorts of weeds and of the webs of spiders Others place it in the middle of a soft and gluey substance whereunto they carefully stick many feathers All do every thing in their power to make it strong and solid and secure themselves from every enemy that Instinct bids them fear by resorting to retired and solitary places  There they lay their eggs The mother and at times the father sits upon them in the nest with admirable perseverance They are taught by nature that the warmth proceeding from their body when they sit upon these eggs puts every thing within them into motion and produces little creatures which at last are strong enough to break the shell that holds them and come forth  You must have often seen a fly in winter to appearance dead You took it in your hands and through the warm h  proceeding from them it was brought to life It is nearly thus with birds the perseverance of the parents when they brood upon their eggs converts them into living creatures  When the mother sits alone the cock will bring her victuals and sit by to please her with his music When the little ones are once alive they help them to get clear  of their confinement in the egg Their diligence is now redoubled they do every thing to nourish and defend them and are constantly employed in this interesting office They go very far indeed to get their food and make an equal distribution of it every one receiving in its turn what they have brought As long as they are very young and helpless they contrive to bring them victuals suited to their delicacy but when once they are grown strong and older they provide them food more solid  There is one and that a very large one called a  pelican  who being forced to go great distances in quest of victuals for her young ones is provided with a sort of bag She fills it with such aliments as she is sensible they love she warms what she procures and renders it by such means fitter for their tender stomachs she returns and empties it before them  In this state of being parents they appear as if forgetting that they want food themselves and only think upon their little family If either rain or tempests come they hurry to their nests and cover it as well as they are able with their outstretched wings so keeping out the wind and water that might hurt the brood All night too they are busy in the work of cherishing the little things The fearfullest among them that will fly away if they but hear the slightest noise and tremble at the least degree of danger know not what fear is when they have once a family to protect but become courageous and intrepid as for instance the common hen As great a coward as she is when by herself she grows a very heroine a pattern of courage when she has young ones to defend from danger She attacks the greatest dog and will not even fear a man who should attempt to take them from her  So too do the little birds endeavour to defend their young when any one would steal or hurt them They will flutter round the nest will seem to call out for assistance will attack the invader and pursue him If their young be shut within a cage they will continue to come regularly and at all times feed them Frequently the mother will prefer confinement with them rather than be freed from the necessity of tending on them and will never quit the little creatures  Poor dear birds cried out the children how we shall love you for the future We will never be so cruel as to do you any harm We will only look at your nests and be contented to gaze on you while employed in the delightful task of tending on your young and to contemplate your little family all flying round their parentsYes dear children said the mother thus it should be Keep your resolution as you ought and I shall love you for it Never injure any creature or occasion it the least degree of pain for pleasure's sake on saying which the mother went in doors embracing her dear children who were highly pleased with what they had just learnt  JAMES  A Merchant whom we shall here call James had but a single son whom he loved very tenderly He was far from having a bad heart his countenance was rather pretty and his friends would all have been very fond of him but that he shewed in every action a covetous propensity which shocked as many as had opportunities of knowing him This covetousness made him violently wish for every thing possessed by others It even wrought upon him to so great a pitch that he would constantly refuse to share among his playmates or even shew them what he had himself His father who possessed a very amiable character wished greatly to reform him of this fault but never had been able All that he could do was to shew how much it grieved him  Little James however lost a great deal more by his propensity to avarice than he had ever gained thereby Did any body give him sweetmeats He would get away and  allow them like a churl in some dark corner of the house for fear lest any one should ask a part Whilst he was hid his father would give twice as much to his companions he perceived it and no longer hid himself but as soon as he fixed his eye on sweetmeats or nice things he appeared as if he would devour them  he pursued the hands of those who held them and his own were in a sort of convulsion  Mr James as we have said before was very much afflicted in perceiving this and that he might not be afflicted further than was absolutely necessary he ceased to give him any more nice things or even have them in the house  Had little James a windmill boat or other plaything he would never shew it he concealed himself in the enjoyment of it and was never happy Or supposing he had any sort of fruit he would not share it with his playmates but devour it all alone refusing even those whom he happened to love most and such as might be hungry therefore none among his play mates would in turn share any thing with him they were indeed best pleased to leave his company they never wished to have it When he chanced to be in a quarrel no one took his part not even when they knew him in the right but being in the wrong all joined against him  As it chanced one day a little boy observed him with an apple in his hand and gave him by surprize a knock upon the elbow so that he was forced to let the apple go He picked it up however but that moment to avenge himself upon the boy that had contrived to play him such a trick he set off to catch him but in running fell into a slough and was almost suffocated in the mud He did his utmost to get out but could not he attempted but without succeeding to prevail upon his playmates to hold out their hands and help him he observed that they only laughed at his distress and in derision danced about the slough from which he could not extricate himself Their cry was "Let  him  now hold out a hand to whom you have been generous Ask assistance of those whom you have obliged" However at length one more compassionate came forward and approaching where he stood stretched forth his hand and got him out in safetyHe shook off the mud that covered him and then to shew his gratitude to that good little boy who had delivered him bit off about a quarter from the apple which had caused this sad disaster and which still he held fast in his hand and would fain have made him take it  The good little boy disgusted with the gift and way of giving took the morsel but to fling it in his face and this was as it were a signal for the rest to scout him They pursued our little James quite home and hallooed all the way  He was not void of feeling and had never yet been hooted he was therefore thrown into a thinking humour and did not afterwards come much into his father's prefence but confined himself to his apartment for above ten days together There he asked himself what cause his playmates had to hate him He addressed himself as follows "For what reason has my little neighbour he that even held me out his hand when I was in the mire such a number of good friends Why is he loved so much while I have not a single little boy that will seek my company nor be my friend nor console me in affliction"He discovered very soon the reason by comparing the good boy's behaviour with his own He recollected that he was happy to do any one a pleasure that whenever he had any fruit confectionary or the like he felt more joy in  ring it with his companion than in eating it himself and had no sort of amusement which he did not wish all his little acquaintances to share He saw plainly on this view of things how much he differed from this little boy in disposition He resolved at last to imitate him and went out next day with both his pockets full of fruit ran up to every boy that he met and gave him some he could not all at once however give up  self  but left a little in his pocket which he eat in private when got home  Although his liberality was not perfect he found occasion to be satisfied with the effect of it since his companions now on their part were more generous to him they shewed themselves more merry in his company they took him as a partner in their little pastimes they divided with him what they had and he went home quite pleased  Upon the morrow he did still a great deal better When he met his little friends he did not fail to pull out of his pocket every thing that he had divided it into as many shares as there were mouths to eat it and reserved a share no more than equal for himself Indeed if there was any  difference some thought that he took the least and he was much more satisfied that day than the preceding  By degrees he was habituated to be generous and even to such as he could see had nothing in return to give I mean to such as were in want Of course he grew beloved whenever his companions saw him they ran up to meet him with the greatest joy upon their countenances they were glad to give him pleasure In short he was now quite happy  Such a change could not escape his father's observation and it gave him real satisfaction He affectionately took him in his arms refused him nothing for the time to come and even sought occasions to delight him Every day little James discerned that to be happy it was absolutely necessary that he should not desire a solitary happiness but wish to make those round about him happy likewise  MAN IS BEST AS HE IS  Mr  Linton  having in his hand a dead parrot stuffed comes in ascends a chair and ties it to a cord already hanging from the cicling  I Fancy that unlucky Frederic will not reach it at this height One can scarcely keep any thing from such a meddling boy  He puts the chair into its place again and then goes out  Frederic  entering a moment afterwards  Where in the name of goodness can papa have poked our poor dead parrot I observed it in his hand when first he came in here but saw him afterwards go out without it  He looks round about the apartment and at last spies the parrot hanging to the cicling  Ah ha there he is  He takes a run and jumps with all his might but wants about three feet or more to reach the parrot  If I were but as active as our greyhound  He pulls a chair into the middle of the room and getting on it is as yet too short he stands on tiptor and then jumps but all without effect He instantly comes  down and runs to fetch a folio volume lettered  Plutarch  on the back he puts this volume on the chair mounts on it and holds out his hands  Shall I never reach the mark I want however sadly to find out how they have stuffed it Let me take another jump  He bends his knees to spring when Marcus entering perceives him and hums the following words  Well leaped in good truth But do not let me disturb you for however active you may be you will need a thousand attempts before you reach it Such a bit of manhood jump so high Come down Let me go up I think I shall not want your Plutarch  He pulls him by the coat till he comes down then mounts in his stead and lifting both his hands is still a great way from the parrot  Frederic  bursting out into a laugh  Ha ha ha ha good Mr Manhood By the manner of your speaking any one would certainly have fancied you as tall as the Monument  Marcus  But if I step upon the book  He stands upon it is a little nearer but not near enough to touch the parrot Frederic jumps about the chair and laughs incessantly  It is not my fault but the thing is this great Plutarch does not happen to be thick enough Only think If there had only been a few more clever fellows in antiquity the parrot would have certainly been mine  Frederic  Or ra  mine for in that case I should have got it first  Marcus  Not that I care about it  Frederic  No indeed not more than Reynard in the fable cared about the grapes the parrot is possibly too greenhey brother  Marcus  What is the use of taking it down I can see it very well at this distance  Frederic  bo  ering Marcus  Yes it is in a charming point of view but hark ye Marcus I do not think that there is so much difference between our heights at last though you are three years older  Marcus  Only think how vain the little creature is Perhaps you would like to measure with me  Frederic  Yes with all my heart  They come together bock to back and make the most of their respective heights  but Frederic stands a tiptoe Marcus is astonished to see him as tall as himself till locking down he sees the reason  Marcus  Ah slyboots is it so Yes yes indeed I grant you if you stand so Come come put down your heels  Frederic  then appearing greatly shorter than his brother  It is a plaguy thing to be so short  Mr Linton  coming in  Because you cannot reach Poll You mean so Don't you Frederick  Frederic  You have been watching us then papa  Mr Linton  No but do not you see Your feet have left it written on my  Plutarch  Marcus  Had we been as tall as you we should then have been able to see Poll a great deal nearer  Mr Linton  Yes and plagued him after he was dead as much as you did while he lived And yet you are tall enough for any sort of mischief  Marcus  O papa what pleasure we should have if we were both as tall as you  Mr Linton  I know you well enough you would not even in that case be content  Marcus  It is true I had much rather be as tall as what d'ye call him there the giant who came down to shew himself for money at the fair  Frederic  That would be but a trifle No as we are wishing and as wishes cost so little we need hardly stop thoreYou recollect our tallest cherrytreeWell then I could wish to be as tall as that  Mr Linton  And why pray  Frederic  Because I should not want either a ladder or a pole when the fruit was ripe Do but think a little brother how delightful it would be to walk about the orchard with our heads among the branches of the trees to browze on cherries pears and apples and to gather them as we do currants from the bush would not this be charming entertainment  Marcus  One might likewise walk along the streets and look into the rooms on either side the way three stories high Ha ha I fancy we should put the people into a fright  Frederic  I should not fear the carriages when I had occasion to cross the street It would be only shaddling  Lock yethus  he strides  and I should see carts waggons coaches men and horses all pass under me and should smile in derision of their littleness  Marcus  You know the river that goes by our house in town We needs must take a boat to cross it or go round by Westminster or Blackfriar's bridges Well I might walk through it then which would be very cooling in the summer  Frederic  And besides all this you know we should be stronger were we bigger If a bull should venture to attack me as I crossed the field I would twist his neck off just as if he were a rabbit or else chuck him up in the air a hundred yards high and when he was come to the ground he should be so busy thinking what a tumble he had that he should forget entirely to get up again  Marcus  We should not then want horses for the plough as we might draw it easily ourselves and in ten steps get quite across a very large field I saw last Thursday more than fifty men at work in driving piles to make a causeway And how hard they worked Well then with such a hammer as my size would let me raise one man night in a single day dispatch their work and not be tired at night so much  Mr Linton  Fine talking truly this but do you know that after all these fine wishes you are no more than two blockheads  Marcus  How papa two blockheads  Mr Linton  Yes to think that you would be happier than at present were you bigger  Marcus  But papa if we were able to do a great deal more than we do at present  Frederic  For example would not it be quite convenient could we reach things very high and take a deal of ground in travelling at a step  Mr Linton  Before I answer you inform me if becoming thus so very tall you would have every thing besides remain as little as it was before your alteration  Frederic  Certainly papa  Marcus  Yes yes there should be none but we three giants  Mr Linton  Thank you but for my part I am contented with my size and would not wish to change it  Frederic  Yet I think we ought not to be near so big as you for otherwise it would be the children's part to whip their father  Mr Linton  It is a happy circumstance for me that I shall not in a hurry be exposed to so much shame and danger  Frederic  Oh but I would spare you recollecting how often you had shewn me favour  Marcus  to his father  You do not wish then to be bigger  Mr Linton  No indeed but let us speak in this place for your brother and you only and observe what would result from your being bigger In the first place then Frederic if as you wished just now you were as tall as that same cherrytree how would you be able as at present to go out and take your walk among so many trees as fill our orchard You would be obliged to crawl upon all fours and even so you would find it very difficult to get along  Frederic  But you forget papa how easily I might put out my foot against the first tree standing in my way and root it up It would be nothing but a wheatstalk to me  Mr Linton  Thereby you would pursue a very prudent plan so in proportion as you wanted much more fruit to satisfy your palate you would destroy the trees that bear it but let us go a little farther than an orchard There are many roads about us upon one side shaded by a row of trees whose branches overhang the pathway Men that are of common heights can walk beneath those branches at their ease and find the shade which they give quite comfortable in the scorching heat of summer and particularly at noonday but you would be obliged to walk along the middle of the road and have no shade And then what would become of you when you were to make your way through any forest What a furious overthrow of trees you would make before you could clear yourself a path  Frederic  I should be no more fatigued than were I now to make a hole sufficient for my passage through a hedge  Marcus  I would uproot the tallest oaks like that same made Grecian that is mentioned in my English Sophocles  Mr Linton  I should sincerely pity those condemned to live about you but with such long legs as you would have you would take it in your head no doubt to travel  Frederic  Travel Why papa I would go from one end of the world to the other  Mr Linton  Like enough And without halting I suppose For where tell me would you find a house a chamber or a bed half big enough for your enormous stature You would certainly be forced to lie all night abroad upon a haystack That would be quite charming Do not you think so  Frederic  Alas I should find myself as badly off as poor Gulliver in Lilliput  Marcus  Ah you have not made your system quite perfect brother I can seeNo that is plain and you must have the rest of men as big as you yourself are  Mr Linton  Why that is more generous I must own But how then would the ground suffice to feed so many monstrous giants In a parish that subsists at present for instance five hundred people twenty would not find provision We should each of us consume our ox in eight and forty hours and might easily drink a butt of milk at breakfast only  Marcus  Oh but I would have the oxen bigger likewise  Mr Linton  And how many of such oxen might be put to graze within a common meadow  Marcus  Truly but a very few indeed  Mr Linton  I see then that for want of pasture we should soon want cattle  Marcus  Well then there is but one thing more to order and the matter is settled We must have the world grow bigger also  Mr Linton  Nothing puzzles you I see To be a few yards taker you would at a minute's notice stretch all nature 'Tis a great thought indeed and yet I fancy you would be far from finding any capital advantage after every thing were settled a you wished  Marcus  And why not dear papa  Mr Linton  Can you inform me what proportion means  Marcus  Proportion No  Mr Linton  Then stand here by your brother Right Now which is tallest you or Frederic  Marcus  You can see yourself papa he does not reach my ear  Mr Linton  Come now and stand by me Now which is shortest  Marcus  I am unfortunately  Mr Linton  It seems then Marcus you are at once both big and little  Marcus  No papa I beg your pardon I am neither big nor little to speak properly I am big respecting Frederic but I am little with respect to you  Mr Linton  And if we were to grow all three together ten times taller would you then be less respecting me or bigger in respect to Frederic than you are at present  Marcus  No papa for there would always be an equal difference  Mr Linton  Then that is what proportion means It is a regular gradation  Marcus  Ah I understand you now  Mr Linton  In that case let us come back to your idea If in nature every thing were to become bigger still preserving its present proportion you would be exactly at the point whence you first of all set out You would not then be capable of frighting people in their garrets by just looking at them through the window you would find it no less difficult to wade across the water or drive piles without assistance than at present and be equally unable to twist off as you expressed it a bull's neck or send him up two hundred yards into the air he would be still much bigger than yourself  Marcus  Yes yes I see he would  Mr Linton  Frederic have you heard us  Frederic  Yes papa  Mr Linton  And understood the meaning of proportion  Frederic  You shall see Proportion is when any one grows bigger and another does the same  Mr Linton  But can you give me an example  Frederic  I believe I can  after having thought a little  as thus It would be in vain for me to tell my brother with a boast that when three years were past I should be  three years older he would still be oldest as he also would be three years older than he is at present  Mr Linton  Excellently well conceived And thus though you should grow as large in stature as our cherrytree our cherrytree in turn would have grown larger also by the difference now between you  Frederic  Yes that is plain  Mr Linton  Could you in that case take the cherries with more ease th  n now you gather currants  Frederic  No papa I should then be obliged to come to my ladder and my pole not the same as formerly for they would not serve me any longer In this case it would be necessary that the proportion should be still preserved  Mr Linton  And would the carriages then pass between your legs  Frederic  No certainly I should be still obliged to keep upon the pavement if I would not have them throw me down  Mr Linton  And what advantage Marcus would you then derive from such a general change of nature as your pride would introduce  Marcus  I do not see any  Mr Linton  Your wishes then were absurd since the accomplishment of them could not have made you more happy  Marcus  Truly you are right papa It would have been much better if we had wished to be littleyes quite little  Frederic  What as little brother as Gulliver's Lilliputians  Marcus  Why not  Mr Linton  Ha ha Another strange conceit And what can be your motives to this wish  Marcus  Because among a number of good consequences one should never fear a famine since a handful of wheat would make bread enough to serve a family for four and twenty hours  Mr Linton  Why truly there might be some savings  Marcus  And besides we should not then have cause to go to war with one another as a place no bigger than our garden would be large enough to build a mighty city Men therefore having much more room than they want  would never go to war with one another as I have heard you say that they do to obtain an inch or two of land  Mr Linton  I would not answer for them in that point acquainted as I am with human folly but I will not disturb so charming an arrangement by my fears and therefore am contented to suppose that I see both peace and plenty flourishing among us and the golden age thanks to your good management brought back again among us  Marcus  Oh that is not all My tutor tells me little creatures are a deal more delicate and perfect in themselves than great ones have a much more piercing sight a finer sense of hearing and in smell are much superior Is that true papa  Mr Linton  In general  Marcus  Thus then were we less by a great deal than at present we should see and hear and smell many things of which at present we have no knowledge  Mr Linton  These advantages it is true are very precious yet I own I should be sorry to renounce for such advantages the universal empire which we now exercise on every thing that breathes  Marcus  There would be no occasion to renounce it for remember you have often told me that man bears rule much more by his understanding than mere strength of body  Mr Linton  True because his strength of body is exactly proportioned to his understanding But bestow upon a Lilliputian's frame the greatest and sublimest genius give him even our inventions and our arts advanced to that perfection which they possess among us do you think that he would be able to employ our slightest instruments and manage properly the meanest of our numberless machines or engines How would he defend himself against wild beasts when even the dog that he keeps within his dwelling would without designing any mischief crush him under foot  Marcus  But then if every thing becomes proportionably little There I think I have you  Mr Linton  Only to confound yourself for granting this proportionality of littleness and men immediately lose all the advantage that you would give them Their deficient harvests would not keep them from the fear of  famine and their wars while they were no less frequent or ferocious than at present would be more ridiculous The inferior animals would still have finer organs and more delicate sensations and perhaps too with his littleness which could not but be laughed at he would take upon him as you do to alter and reform the universe  Marcus  I think papa you are much too hard upon me one can settle nothing with you  Frederic  For this reason brother because you know nothing about the matter There is but one way to order things as they should be  Mr Linton  Bravoso you take the man of consequence upon you  Frederic  Yes as well as Marcus  Mr Linton  Come then let me know how you would settle the affair your system must be very curious I suppose  Frederic  Why then papa we only want one thing we only want to have a harder body one as hard as iron  Mr Linton  And why so  Frederic  You see where I have pricked my finger It seems nothing yet you cannot imagine how much pain it gives me  Mr Linton  My poor little man I am sorry for it  Frederic  And the wound that I received in my head about a month ago by tumbling as you remember down stairs It was but cured a week ago feel here papathere that is the place  Mr Linton  I feel the sear indeed  Frederic  What pleasure it would be to play with Pompey and not fear his biting me And besides when I were old enough to be a soldier and go fight I should in that case laugh at balls and bullets Nay my head would blunt the broadest sword that struck it would not that be vastly pretty  Mr Linton  That it would indeed  Frederic  In that case we should want for nothing we should be quite perfect should we not papa  Mr Linton  taking out an orange  See here my little fellow smell this orange  Frederic  Oh how fine It must be very good to eat Do you design to give it me for having settled matters better than my brother  Mr Linton  No it is not for you  Marcus  For me then  Mr Linton  Nor for you I mean it for a certainI do not know if I should say a certain person but however that beone more perfect than you are  Marcus  And who is that papa  Mr Linton  You will wonder very likely when I tell youthat negro figure on my mantlepiece  Frederic  You joke papa why he can neither see nor eat nor smell  Mr Linton  And yet he is made of iron  Frederic  Yes and for that very reason he cannot  Mr Linton  What then you would have sacrificed the satisfaction of seeing eating and smelling to the boast that you could never break your head by falling from my mantlepiece for were you made of iron as you wished you would be only fit to stand there with my other bronzes  Frederic  Oh I do not mean so papa I would be living while I had this iron body  Mr Linton  And how then could it be animated by that blood and by those juices that keep up our life By what means could its nerves be flexible and have that sensibility which makes us so expert or ready in the use of every limb and readers the enjoyment of our senses so delightful  Frederic  Oh dear me this is sad work I see my scheme is hardly better than my brother's  Marcus  But papa since you are so clever in destroying our plans thus it is your turn to provide us with a better in their stead  Mr Linton  And why should I provide one I am marvellously satisfied with that which God's providence has already established Yes dear children I am sensible we are completely furnished with whatever can promote our happiness superior in our conformation to all other animals we tame by virtue of our genius the small number of those which in strength surpass us If we have not the rapidity of stags and horses we can make that composition which will overtake the one while he is running from  us and can mount the other to direct him whither we think proper We have not the wings of a bird yet we can give wings to those tall trees that grow in scrests and can make them carry us to the remotest distances Our sight less piercing than an insect's is not bounded to the narrow space in which we move about but can take in an ample horizon and contemplate the great miracles of nature We are unable to gaze like an eagle at the sun but we invent an instrument which seems to draw us nearer to that luminary so that we may measure his immensity of distance and observe the place which he possesses in the midst of an infinity of stars that are obscured by his superior brightness Every other sense that we have contributes likewise to procure us a succession of enjoyments and effect our safety Conscious of our genius we are every day in search of new discoveries we disarm the thunder or else tell it where to fall we make one element resist another we oppose the beneficial warmth of fire to the inclemency of frost and keep the land from being overflowed by inundations Sometimes we descend into the darkest bowels of the earth and bring out thence those precious metals which are purified and then by an ingenious mode of mixing them together form new substances and sometimes we mark out those rocks which hang just ready as it were to fall upon our heads precipitate them from their height into the vallies and soon after make them reascend in sumptuous edifices or in stately pyramids that hide their summits in the clouds The society that we form with our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our mutual wants obtains us in return for our own toil the labour of ten thousand hands all eager to procure us the conveniencies of life Upon whatever side we turn we have at our command the various productions of the universe all brought together for our use The sciences exalt our souls and charm our faculties The arts by having introduced such numberless machines assist us in our labour or refresh us when we seek repose Both memory and reflection give us the advantages enjoyed by all those who have preceded us Together with the pleasing idea of our own personal existence we derive happiness from others also by the virtues of compassion and beneficence and by the connexions of kindred and of friendship Nevertheless our  happiness depends upon ourselves alone amid the host of creatures that surround us being sure of obtaining it if we but moderately use our strength and make a constant application of our reason to the business of determining our conduct so that if we ever interrupt our happiness by going further than we should do we have nothing to blame in that case but our own folly We then seem children as you are who instead of gratefully enjoying the conveniencies and comforts of our situation and courageously enduring its few evils vex ourselves with wishing for ideal blessings or disgrace our nature by a lack of manly courage  FASHIONABLE EDUCATION  A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  MRS BELLASTON  LEONORA  her Niece  DAVID  her Nephew  MR VINCENT  a Clergyman formerly Tutor to the Children's Father  DANDIPRAT  a Dancingmaster  FANNY  a Waiting Maid  The  SCENE  is in the house of Mrs Bellaston  SCENE I  Mrs Bellaston Mr Vincent  Mrs Bellaston  NO I cannot forgive you Mr Vincent What not come and see your wellbeloved little friends or me these five years past  Mr Vincent  Consider my good lady the inevitable duties of my parish the bad state in which my health is and the fear of accidents upon the road  Mrs Bellaston  What forty miles a very long journey truly  Mr Vincent  Long to me who cannot easily change place My bodily infirmities no longer permit me to go a gadding and especially so far from home  Mrs Bellaston  And pray to what powerful motive Mr Vincent do we owe this instance of your resolution  Mr Vincent  To the great desire that I had of seeing Leonora and her brother once more I may say before I die  Mrs Bellaston  Ah there is a fine girl Leonora one might come to view her from the furthest corner of the world Oh such an understanding and vivacity  Mr Vincent  Indeed you make me very anxious Mrs Bellaston to behold her Pray where is she I long to embrace her  Mrs Bellaston  She has not left her toilet yet  Mr Vincent  Not at this late hour And David why is not he yet come from school I thought he would have long ago been here and waiting to receive me  Mrs Bellaston  You remember it was a little late when your arrival was announced last night The servants have been very bosy all this morning and my niece's waitingwoman could not leave her  Mr Vincent  Pray oblige me by dispatching some one instantly for David and in the interval I will go up stairs and see his sister  Mrs Bellaston  No no Mr Vincent the surprise of seeing you might overcome her spirits I will prepare her for the interview  She goes out  SCENE II  Mr Vincent alone  As far as I can see into the matter Mrs Bellaston brings her niece up by the plan that regulated her own education and permits her to employ a deal of time in setting off her person to the best advantage like a doll intended for the window of a toyshop Happy if these trifles have not caused her to neglect the cultivation of her understanding  SCENE III  Mr Vincent Mrs Bellaston  Mrs Bellaston  returning  I have sent for David and Leonora is coming down this instant She has but one feather more to settle  Mr Vincent  How one feather Can you suppose that I care about a feather more or less Should not her anxiety to see me be as great as mine is  Mrs Bellaston  Certainly it should and is but then her wish to give you pleasure  Mr Vincent  Possibly it will not be her feathers that will do that but if I recollect you told me that you had sent to fetch your nephew  Mrs Bellaston  somewhat piqued  Oh my nephew You will have time enough for David  Mr Vincent  You speak as if I was not to expect great things from him  Mrs Bellaston  He is far from being vicious but he will not attend to my instructions on the subject of good breeding  Mr Vincent  What is he unpolished wild or rustic  Mrs Bellaston  No not that They tell me that his head is well stored with useful knowledge as they call it but that  je ne sçai quoi  which well bred people possess and that  bon ton    Mr Vincent  If that be all that he wants he is not a great way from perfectionbut his heart  Mrs Bellaston  I think it neither good nor bad but Leonora how accomplished she is what enchanting manners As for David we do not see one another often  Mr Vincent  And why not  Mrs Bellaston  For fear of taking him from his beloved studies and because when he comes here he pays no heed to what I tell him on the way of living in the fashionable world Besides he cannot express himself with any sort of grace I sometimes carry him into the company of women and he never has a handsome word to say  Mr Vincent  Because as I suppose the conversation turns upon matters to which he is quite a stranger  Mrs Bellaston  But sure a wellbred youth should never be a stranger to such topics as are started in the company of women  Mr Vincent  A respectful silence suits his present age and it is his business to be silent and so learn to speak in future when his turn comes round  Mrs Bellaston  And would you make the youth a doll that is not to have motion till his wheels are on But you shall hear my Leonora talk she does it with such ease such spirit such vivacity There is no such thing as following her when once she is set a going  Mr Vincent  We shall see which of them will be most entitled to my love You cannot but remember how I promised at their father's death to look upon them as my own I will perform this sacred duty As I cannot tell how long I have to live I am come to see these children and to know their different characters which I design to study so that I may regulate accordingly the final disposition of my fortune in their favour  Mrs Bellaston  Such proceeding is entirely of a piece with every former token of your gratitude and generosity My brother even in his grave feels your beneficence and how can I express my obligations to you as I ought for Leonora and her brother  Mr Vincent  What you call beneficence dear lady in me is no more than duty Your esteemed and worthy father trusted to my care the education of his son your brother and this brother anxious for his tutor's happiness presented me the living that I possess To him I am indebted therefore for my present happiness and as I have myself no children his belong to me and have a right even while I am living and much more after I am dead to all the worldly fortune that I possess and which I study to increase for their advantage and no other purpose  Mrs Bellaston  I can easily believe you and in that case Leonora as the loveliest  Mr Vincent  If I make distinctions it will not be upon account of frivolous or outside beauty but superior virtue or superior merit in them will obtain the preference  Mrs Bellaston  Ah here Leonora comes  SCENE IV  Mr Vincent Mrs Bellaston and Leonora dressed in all the extravagance of fashion  Mr Vincent  with astonishment  How Is this then Leonora  Mrs Bellaston  You are surprised I see to find her at first sight so captivating  To Leonora  You have made us wait a little my sweet girl  Leonora  making a ceremonious curtsey to Mr Vincent  Because the servant could not place my feathers to my liking notwithstanding she removed them half a dozen times I sent her off at last quite out of humour and did every thing myselfI hope I see you well sir  Mr Vincent  going towards her and affectionately holding out his hand  And I hope my dear Leonora  Leonora turns away and seems indifferent  Wellare you unwilling to consider me as if I were your father  Mrs Bellaston  Yes my dear your father and your benefactor I request  to Mr Vincent  you would excuse her she has always been brought up in modesty and I have constantly enjoined her a reserve  Mr Vincent  She would not sure have violated either by receiving me as children do a father I must likewise tenderly reproach her for the circumstance of having staid so long up stairs while I was all impatience to behold her  Leonora  Pardon me dear sir I was not fit to come before you with propriety  Mr Vincent  But surely a young lady should be always fit to come before a plain man as I am with propriety A modest and decent undress is all that she wants for such a purpose when at home  Mrs Bellaston  You are right but to receive a guest like Mr Vincent the respect which she owes you whispered the necessity of putting on  Mr Vincent  One feather less and might have whispered the propriety of being eager to come f  rth and meet a friend who travels forty miles to see her Yes I own my heart would have been infinitely more delighted to behold my childrenfor the tenderness with which I  think at all times of them and the gratitude which I owe their father makes them such and therefore I repeat it to behold my children run with open arms to meet me  Mrs Bellaston  But the awe that seized her at first sight of you  Mr Vincent  Let us drop the subject When you see me next you will receive me more affectionately Won't you Leonora You are not displeased that I speak thus freely to you I was used to such a language in your childhood and the five long years that I have passed without once seeing you have made no alteration in my heart I hope even when you are married that I shall have permission to continue such a sweet familiarity  Leonora  It will be doing me a deal of honour  Mr Vincent  Oh no more of these same ceremonious compliments Say only that it will give you pleasure But how much you are altered for the better since I saw you last An elegant appearance easy manners and a carriage  Mrs Bellaston  Oh quite charming quite adorable  Mr Vincent  And yet all this is nothing if one wants the grace of modesty the charm of affability the sweet expression goodness marks the countenance withal and that perpetual source of pleasure a well cultivated understanding  Mrs Bellaston  Yes that sort of cultivation which can only be pursued by intercourse with fashionable people  Mr Vincent  Fashionable people madam And is Leonora to spend her life with such I have nothing left to wish her if she has but those endearing qualities that may obtain her honour amongst a well chosen circle of acquaintances at times indeed abroad but commonly at home ensuring her the approbation of her friends and of her own heart  Mrs Bellaston  Yes yes that is always understood I mean that she should learn what sort of conduct will procure her honour and respect from such as know what life is as we say Come Leonora let us hear you play some pretty piece on your harpsichord  Leonora  No dear aunt it might not be acceptable to Mr Vincent  Mr Vincent  Not acceptable my dearest child I am quite delighted when I hear good music and think no amusement more proper for you  Mrs Bellaston  What more worthy of our admiration than those charming sciences called drawing music dancing and perhaps too some few others Leonora give us that sweet air of Signor Squalini's composition  Leonora goes to her harpsichord with a discontented air fingers the keys and begins a sonata  No no you must sing too LeonoraShe has such a voice Mr Vincentso sweet You will hear it If you knew how much applause she got for her performance at the concert you would be perfectly astonished You must know however she is a little vain and one must sometimes kneel or not a note  Mr Vincent  I hope I shall obtain a note without proceeding to that ceremonyShan't I Leonora  Leonora  Sir your commands are sufficient at any time  Mr Vincent  No my dear I do not command I only request  Leonora  in a whisper to her aunt while looking for the air  I am indebted for all this to you  Mrs Bellaston  whispering Leonora  For heaven's sake Leonora seem more cheerful and do every thing that you are asked Your fortune very possibly depends upon it  Mr Vincent  If your voice my love is not so clear as you could wish no matter only sing your best and you are sure to please me  Leonora plays and sings the following words  Sweetly smelling flower  Thus waking with the morning hour  Go to my Laura's breast and grace  With added fragrance that already fragrant place  So thou wilt bloom indeed  But like a useless weed  If on the stalk here thou remain  Thy beauty will decay  Thy fragrance pass away  And thy bright colours glow in vain  Mrs Bellaston  clapping her hands  Bravo bravissimo  Mr Vincent  In truth it is not so much amiss considering she is but a child However I supposed that I  should have heard a song containing something of the principles with which no doubt you study to inspire her  Mrs Bellaston  How dear sir do not you perceive the moral of it  She sings  If on the stalk here thou remain  Thy beauty will decay  Thy fragrance pass away  And thy bright colours glow in vain  Which is as much as saying our young women should come forth and mingle with the world if they would turn their knowledge to advantage and not die shut up within their houses  Mr Vincent  Trust me my dear lady it is much rather there than elsewhere that worthy husbands will be glad to find them But what is this  casting his eyes upon a drawing  Mrs Bellaston  That is one of Leonora's doing Do not you find it charming  Mr Vincent  It is not bad indeed if Leonora did it all without the assistance of her master  Mrs Bellaston  Why to say the truth sir he has touched it up a little  Mr Vincent  My opinion here again is that Leonora would have shown more judgment in selecting something of a different subject as for instance if instead of representing thus a sleeping shepherdess surprised by a filthy faun she had applied her pencil to set forth some virtuous action  that  would have improved her hand as much while it improved her heart still more  SCENE V  Mrs Bellaston Mr Vincent Leonora Fanny  Fanny  Sir  to Mr Vincent  your portmante  u is arrivedWhere will you have it putIn your apartment  Mr Vincent  to Mrs Bellaston  Do you mean then my good lady that I shall have my lodging with you  Mrs Bellaston  Certainly and by accepting it you will do me no less honour than I myself have pleasure in the offer  Mr Vincent  You oblige me Therefore with permission I will go see if every thing is right and return immediately  SCENE VI  Mrs Bellaston Leonora  Leonora  He is gone at last then is he  Mrs Bellaston  Softy softly Leonora he may chance to hear you  Leonora  Let him hear me if he pleases I am so vexed I could destroy my drawings tear my music book and dash my instrument to pieces  Mrs Bellaston  Be composed my dear you have occasion now for all your moderation  Leonora  It is enough I think that I shewed my moderation in his presence You yourself both saw and heard him  Mrs Bellaston  People of his age have always many oddities  Leonora  Why then expose me to them You should not have said a word about my singing aunt I did not like to sing This always comes of your desire to shew me to the best advantage as you say and though you see the mischief you will repeat it when he comes again  Mrs Bellaston  My dearest Leonora be persuaded You do not know perhaps that your fortune in the world depends on Mr Vincent  Leonora  What my fortune  Mrs Bellaston  Yes indeed Must I inform you how much you are indebted to his bounty  Leonora  Oh I know as far as certain petty presents amount which he sends me now and then But surely I could do without his presents  Mrs Bellaston  Ah my dearest child without him you would be exceedingly unhappy What your father left you is a very trifle and my income no great matter With the assistance of these means alone it was not possible that I could have given you such an education as you have  Leonora  And is it possible that I am so indebted to him Does he likewise shew himself a friend and benefactor to my mother  Mrs Bellaston  Yes it is he that pays his board and education  Leonora  I was never told of this  Mrs Bellaston  Since you have never wanted any thing what need was there to tell you of it You observe by this of what importance you should think it to keep watch upon your conduct and behave to Mr Vincent with respectBut still my dear this is not all for he is come expressly for the purpose of observing you and David before  e makes his will and gives you his estate accordinglyto each as he supposes you to deserve it  Leonora  Oh how sorry I am now that I seemed so vexed and fretted in his presence  Mrs Bellaston  He is certainly a worthy man but still was much to blame in  earing with such coldness your sweet voice and not appearing charmed with your harpsichord But however that be you must absolutely seek to please him or your brother will obtain a preference in his will  Leonora  Alas he merits it much more than I do  Mrs Bellaston  More You have too mean opinion of yourself my sweetest if you think so And besides if he should really obtain a preference what would be your destiny A man can always make his way through life but what resources can a woman have  Leonora  What indeed Your argument convinces me that I should have learnt things much more necessary than the use of a harpsichord dancing or even drawing  Mrs Bellaston  Why you simpleton with such a fortune as by Mr Vincent's favour you have reason to hope what can you desire in preference to the arts of shining in a fashionable circle Mr Vincent must be won and with a little complaisance if you but shew it you may do whatever you think proper with him  SCENE VII  Mrs Bellaston Leonora Fanny  Fanny  Mr Dandiprat the dancingmaster madam  Mrs Bellaston  Well desire him to walk up  The servant retires  Leonora  No aunt let him be sent away today I beg or I shall once again fret Mr Vincent  Mrs Bellaston  He must absolutely see you dance you move with so much ease you will charm him I am certain  Going to the door  Mr Dandiprat come in  SCENE VIII  Mrs Bellaston Leonora Dandiprat  Mrs Bellaston  I appeal to you sir does not Leonora dance like an angel  Dandiprat  bowing  Absolutely madam  Mrs Bellaston  Very likely I shall have a friend come here to see her dance a little You will oblige me therefore if you make her shew her skill as much as possible to please him  Dandiprat  Certainly madam and my own skill too you may depend on it  SCENE IX  Mrs Bellaston Leonora Dandiprat Mr Vincent  Mrs Bellaston  Apropos for here he comes  To Mr Vincent entering  A chair for Mr VincentHere here my dear sirYou are come in time for Leonora's dancing lesson you must see how she performs You would take her for a zephyrMr Dandiprat pray let your pupil dance the new allemand  Leonora  I cannot dance it by myself  Mrs Bellaston  Fear nothing Mr Dandiprat will dance with you and I will hum the tune Come never fear I will keep good time  Mr Vincent  But what hinders us from having a minuet I like that best and beg to have it  Dandiprat  I shall not perform it with a grace if I must play as well as dance  Mr Vincent  Sir it is not your performance that we consider but your pupil's  Dandiprat  You would judge much better of her merit in a grand chaconne  Mr Vincent  Chaconne what is that  Dandiprat  It is in the higher stile of dancing  Mr Vincent  But Leonora never means to figure at the Operahouse I want a minuet  Dandiprat  As you please sir Come then miss a minuet  Leonora dances Dandiprat moves with her playing on his kit and interrupts his music now and then with these instructions  Your head a little higherShoulders backLet your arms play freelySinkOne two and threeYour partnerLook at me  Mr Vincent  when the minuet is finished  Come this is tolerable Leonora  To Dandiprat  Sir your lesson if you please is finished for today  Dandiprat makes a ceremonious bow to the company and leaves the room  Leonora  whispering Mrs Bellaston  Well aunt you see what compliments I have had  Mrs Bellaston  And is it possible my dear good sir that you are not enchanted ravished nay transported Surely your attention was diverted or perhaps you are not recovered yet from the fatigue that your journey has occasioned you  Mr Vincent  I beg your pardon madam I have already signified to Leonora how I liked her dancing but you would not surely see me in a transport at her merit in this way No I reserve my extasy for merit much more proper to excite it  SCENE X  Mrs Bellaston Leonora Mr Vincent David  David  running into the room towards Mr Vincent and ambracing him with ardour  O my dear dear Mr Vincent my good friend and father How rejoiced I am to see you  Mrs Bellaston  How the boy rushes in Do you mean to stifle Mr Vincent  Mr Vincent  Let him do it my good madam for the transports of his joy delight me more than cold and ceremonious salutations Yes my dearest David come here and let me press you to my heart What pleasing recollection you awake within me Yes these open features are the living image of your dear departed father  Mrs Bellaston  Why not put your best clothes on Do people see friends in that trim  David  But aunt it would have cost me half an hour at least to change my dress and put my hair in order and I never should have had the patience to delay so long the pleasure of seeing Mr Vincent  Mr Vincent  And I too my dear boy was quite impatient and thought every minute half an hour between the time of my arrival and this moment  Mrs Bellaston  Well sir have you nothing then to say to me or Leonora You have not so much as wished us a good morning  David  Pardon me dear aunt I was so glad I did not know what I was doing And do you forgive me too dear sister  holding out his hand  if without intention I have displeased you Have I Leonora  Leonora  half offended  No sir  Mr Vincent  Excuse him madam upon my account I should be sorry to be the occasion of reproach to him  Mrs Bellaston  aside  I can hold no longerBe so kind good sir as to excuse me I have several orders to give the servants  Mr Vincent  Do not confine yourself on my account  Mrs Bellaston  whispering Leonora  You will hardly stay and hear their insupportable discourse  Aloud  Come Leonora I have something to employ you in  Leonora  No aunt I will stay with Mr Vincent if he will please to let me  Mr Vincent  Let you my dear child I shall be glad to have you with me  Mrs Bellaston goes out with manifest vexation  SCENE XI  Mr Vincent Leonora David  Mr Vincent  Well David is your master well pleased with out benaviour and improvement  David  He himself sir is the proper person to answer that One thing however I can say that I am pretty well established in his favour  Mr Vincent  What are you studying at present  David  Latin Greek and geography the history of England and the mathematics  Leonora  aside  Here are many things that I scarcely know by name  Mr Vincent  And pray tell me do you like them  David  Oh the more I learn the more I wish to go on learning and am not the lowest in my class neither  Mr Vincent  Then too your drawing music dancing  David  Those too I am learning but apply myself much more this sultry weather to the musicmaster and my drawing as the doctor says that I must not exercise myself too violently In return when Winter comes I shall apply myself more closely to my dancing when a deal of jumping will be comfortable  Mr Vincent  Why your plan I must acknowledge seems well laid  David  Besides sir I shall never give a deal of time to dancing hardly more than what the doctor lets me have for recreation The essential thing he tells me is to form my heart and cultivate my understanding so that I may live with honour in the world become a useful member of society and make myself by that means happy  Mr Vincent  embracing him  You are in the right dear boy  Leonora  aside  If these are so essential how has my aunt neglected me  David  And yet dear sir though you embrace and love me so I am not perhaps so good as you imagine  Mr Vincent  How  David  I am very giddy and I waste my time I cannot rid myself of several exceptionable habits and for  want of thought relapse into those very faults for which I have so frequently been sorry  Mr Vincent  And will you still relapse into them  David  Not if I have my thoughts about me but I find it very difficult to keep in memory at all times my good resolutions  Mr Vincent  I am very glad to find that you can discern yourself these faults within you To acknowledge that we do wrong is something akin to doing well What think you Leonora  Leonora  I believe I am neither giddy nor yet wasteful of my time nor have I any of my brother's faults  Mr Vincent  Then I suppose you have other faults  Leonora  I never heard my aunt say that I had any  Mr Vincent  She should know indeed and be the first to notice them but affection too often blinds us so that we can see no faults in those that we loveI do not mean to vex you saying this believe me  Leonora  aside  What a man He flatters David and answers me with nothing but vexatious speeches  Mr Vincent  Wait here a little I will go see if my servant has unpacked my trunks I have something for you and shall soon be back  David  Yes yes we will wait here for you Do not stay long  SCENE XII  Leonora David  Leonora  I fancy he may keep his presents to himself They must be charming things indeed that  he  has to give us  David  What Dear sister does not every thing that you have in your apartment and even upon your back come from our dear benefactor Should he have the veriest trifle in his trunk to give me I should still be charmed in thinking on his bounty  Leonora  Possibly you might but I am so angry with him with myself and with my auntthat I could find it in my heart to quarrel with all the world  David  What with me too among the restWhat ails you then my poor dear sister  taking Leonora by the hand  Leonora  Had you been so mortified  David  So mortified Have you been mortified then sister Who has mortified you Not my aunt for she will hardly let you breathe for fear of catching cold and would I fancy suffer you to tread upon her if to touch the ground could hurt you  Leonora  Yes but Mr Vincent he is so captious  David  How you talk I think him on the contrary indulgent and goodnatured  Leonora  I have done nothing to his liking When I sung and danced I could not please him and my drawing had no better fortune He despises every thing that I know and speaks of merit much more calculated to excite his approbation than a skill in dancing  David  Between you and me I think him in the right  Leonora  In the right Then my aunt is in the wrong according to your notion is she What does he mean by merit much more calculated to excite his approbation than a skill in dancing  David  I can tell you and yet not be very learned  Leonora  Oh yes you indeed Well then what is it  David  Tell me Leonora do you ever read  Leonora  Yes doubtless when I have time  David  And what  Leonora  Why plays before I go to see them and a great variety of songs that I may sing them to my master  David  That is fine reading truly for your age And do not you think that you might have books much more instructive  Leonora  If I might what time have I to read them It is full one o'clock before I have breakfasted and put my morning dress on Then comes Mr Quaver and when he has left me Mr Dandiprat I dine at four and after dinner dress for company which we receive at home or else go out a visiting and then the day is over  David  And is every day spent thus  Leonora  No doubt  David  Well sister I can tell you that Doctor Sharp my master has three daughters of about your age but they employ their time in quite another manner  Leonora  How  David  First then at six in Summer and at eight in Winter they are dressed completely for the day  Leonora  Then they do not sleep enough and must be very heavy long before night comes  David  On the contrary they are brisker far than you because they go to bed at ten every night  Leonora  To bed at ten  David  At ten that they may get up early in the morning When you are fast asleep in bed they have received their lessons in geography and cyphering When the clock strikes ten they take their needlework in hand till noon and then assist their mother in the house  Leonora  Does their mother mean to make them housemaids  David  She may hope by means of such an education to procure them something better But however that be should they not be taught to govern servants regulate a table and conduct their house  Leonora  And after dinner are they busy  David  Why not busy They have then their harpsichord or writing and at night assemble round a table where they read by turns in the Spectator or Miss Moore's last publication  Sacred Dramas  while the two that are not occupied upon their book employ themselves in mending their own clothes or examining the linen of the house and mending it if needful  Leonora  So then they never take any recreation  David  Oh I beg your pardon They amuse themselves as if they were three queens for all these tasks are intermixed with little sports and pleasant conversation They pay visits also and receive them but take care to have their workbags and I never saw them idle for a minute  Leonora  This is certainly what Mr Vincent meant And yet my aunt has often told me that such an education as according to your account the Miss Sharps receive is only fit for tradesmen's children  David  But supposing them to be tradesmen's children would they find this education useless to them They should certainly know houshold work or how will they be able to direct a servant If they know nothing of it every one will join to cheat them and the richer they  may be the greater probability there is that even the servants whom they employ will join each other to effect their ruin  Leonora  I protest you fright me I know nothing of the work about a house scarce how to hold a needle Yet I have just been told that we have nothing in the world except what Mr Vincent's bounty gives us  David  Ah dear sister so much the worse for us should he leave us or should we unfortunately lose himBut possibly my aunt is rich  Leonora  Oh no she told me to the contrary scarce half an hour ago She has no more than is sufficient for herself In case then any accident should happen with respect to Mr Vincent what would be our sate  David  I should be at first put to difficulties but my master tells me that I should trust in God and hope that he never would forsake me His opinion is that there are always generous people in the world whose friendship may be gained by an exertion of one's skill to serve them in the way of some profession and who frequently create employment for the industrious Thus then in the course of some few years when I am more advanced in learning I might undertake to teach such children as know less than I do I should even improve myself by such an occupation and with good behaviour on my part be sure of living with some sort of ease and comfort and perhaps strike out a way to fortune  Leonora  But what benefit could I derive from all my skill in dancing or in drawing or in music I should die perhaps of hunger notwithstanding all these vain accomplishments  David  And therefore Mr Vincent cannot be well pleased when he discovers that you have been put to nothing but those arts which serve for ornament or pleasure  Leonora  And vexation sometimes David for when I dance or sing in company if I am not praised as much as I suppose myself to merit you cannot think how much I am fretted at the disappointmentShall I also tell you that I am often tired of those fine matters which my aunt says serve us to pass time away with satisfaction  David  And how do you entertain yourself then  Leonora  With the opera dress fashions walks and scandal we tell in one house what we have observed beforehand in another But these helps to conversation and the art of killing time soon fails us  David  I believe so They are very poor subjects of entertainment when one thinks of those that may be found in art and nature which not only occupy our time agreeably but teach us to reflect upon ourselves  Leonora  You have convinced me of it by yourself who notwithstanding you are two years younger than I am are so much more improved How many useful things has my aunt neglected in my education  SCENE XIII  Leonora David Mrs Bellaston  Mrs Bellaston  having overheard what Leonora said  And what useful things have I neglected in your education then Miss Thankless  aside  But all this is due to David  David  Well good bye sister and good bye dear aunt I wonder Mr Vincent stays so long up stairs I will run and seek him if you please  goes out  SCENE XIV  Mrs Bellaston Leonora  Mrs Bellaston  The goodfornothing blockhead Let his friend be once set off and we shall see if he presumes to come into my presence again But what has he been saying that you think your education thus neglected  Leonora  Indeed dear aunt it is true for have you let me learn those useful matters which a young person ought to know  Mrs Bellaston  Useful matters my divine dear Leonora Is there any thing wanting in the least to your perfections Does not every one acknowledge that you are quite accomplished  Leonora  Some things I know it is true but they are only such as serve to flatter vanity Those arts that  ornament the mind as geography Arithmetic History  Mrs Bellaston  All downright pedantry I should be vexed to death if I had puzzled your poor brains with such old stuff that is only fit for such a one as David Why Leonora did you ever hear where I have carried you that fashionable women mind such nonsense  Leonora  No indeed but still why not instruct me in those houshold arts at least that a person of my sex should know Can I even hold a needle  Mrs Bellaston  No and why because I never meant you for a mantua maker  Leonora  But supposing Mr Vincent to die supposing that I was to fall into distress what are my resources how should I subsist  Mrs Bellaston  If that be all I have a single word that will settle every thing as I can tell you now that you will never want for money but even swim in plenty I have teazed Mr Vincent so effectually that he means to leave you all his fortune But here he comes himself I leave you with him as he means to tell you his intentions  SCENE XV  Leonora Mr Vincent David  David  running to his sister with a watch  Look ye look ye sister  Leonora  How what is this a watch  David  Yes sister and a gold one O my dear dear Mr Vincent how rejoiced I am Pray let me go and shew it to the doctor I will be there and back again immediately  Mr Vincent  With all my heart Inform him that it was not my design to please your vanity by such a present but that you might know the different hours allotted to your different studies and be always ready for your masters  David  Oh I shall be always ready for them now that is certain  Mr Vincent  Beg him likewise to allow you the remainder of the day from school and tell him that I mean to call upon him in the afternoon  David  Yes yes I will  He goes out  SCENE XVI  Mr Vincent Leonora who appears pensive  Mr Vincent  Well Leonora why so gloomy What is the matter with you  Leonora  Nothing sir  Mr Vincent  You are not vexed that I have made your brother such a present  Leonora  Doubtless he will be very careful of it and knows how to handle it  Mr Vincent  I have shown him how and there is no difficulty in the matter You are sensible that he wanted one  Leonora  Quite so and I for my part could not find a use for such a bauble  Mr Vincent  I was thinking so you have a clock upon the staircase  Leonora  True and yet there is hardly a young lady that I know but has a watch  Mr Vincent  That is lucky you may ask them then the hour at any time  Leonora  I may and when they ask the same of me make answer that I cannot tell them  Mr Vincent  Leonora Leonora you are an envious little puss I see but here is to prove that you have not been forgotten  giving her a case  Leonora  blushing  O my dear good Mr Vincent  Mr Vincent  Well I see you do not know how to open it  he opens it himself and shows a pair of diamond carrings  Are you content with these  Leonora  Oh yes if you are but content with me  Mr Vincent  To say the truth my dear I am not quite so we are now alone and I must use a little freedom in conversing with you Your dear aunt has spared no cost to let you have agreeable accomplishments and you appearance is a proof of her affection and good taste I  could only have wished that she had been minded to bestow a useful education on you  Leonora  David has been discoursing on this subject and convinced me that I want every thing which would be useful to me at a future time of life but how may I acquire a knowledge of these useful matters  Mr Vincent  I am acquainted with a worthy gentlewoman who instructs young ladies in such knowledge as is suited to their sex  Leonora  My aunt however mentioned that you would put me into such a state as would not need this knowledge  Mr Vincent  I understand you and to shew my real disposition leave you quite at liberty to chuse that way of life in which she meant to see you figure since it suits your inclination Yes my dearest child rely on my affection After my decease I will give you every shilling that I possess  Leonora  What all your fortune  Mr Vincent  Yes  eonora all but not without a fear that it will be still too little to prevent your being really unhappy  Leonora  Is it possible  Mr Vincent  Are you qualified to do yourself the slightest service or make up upon occasion I do not say a costly garment but the plainest gown that you ever wore  Leonora  Alas sir I was never taught  Mr Vincent  It is plain then you must always have a crowd about you to make up those articles which you have no hands to make yourself You know I suppose how much fashionable women have occasion to lay out that they may keep their title up with those who are as gay and foolish as themselves Now tell me are you to suppose that my property when you are mistress of it will suffice for this  Leonora  I hope sir it will be enough with the oeconomy that I shall observe to render me as happy as you wish me to be  Mr Vincent  Trust me notwithstanding your oeconomy if you continue ignorant it will not And besides when you are come of age what prudent man will take a woman who possesses no one talent conducive to his happiness It is plain then nothing but the fortune that  you possess will render you an eligible wife and this circumstance shews still stronger the necessity of securing a fortune to you after my death  Leonora  O sir but then my brother  Mr Vincent  He must be content with what I do in his behalf while living and the proofs of your affection when I am dead I mean to have him taught whatever may be useful to him in the state of life that he may prefer as in that with industry it is not improbable but he may make a fortune I myself am an example of this probability he need but do as I have done I leave you to reflect on my intentions and shall communicate them to him as soon as he returns  SCENE XVII  Leonora alone  Oh what pleasure heiress to all his fortune This is what my aunt desired so earnestly I should be glad to know what David will say when Mr Vincent tells him his intentions He must be very jealous of me However I shall not forget him No indeed if I have any thing to spare I must and will have something for him but I hear Mr Vincent coming back with DavidA lucky thought I will steal into this closet here and listen to their conversation  She goes in and shuts the door unnoticed  SCENE XVIII  Mr Vincent David  Mr Vincent  So your master is pleased then that I have made you such a present  David  Yes enchanted but for my part upon second thoughts I am sorry for it  Mr Vincent  Sorry David and why  David  Poor Leonora she must doubtless be quite vexed at having nothing when I am master of a watch I would not seem indifferent to your favours notwithstanding if I durst I would desire you  Mr Vincent  Generous little fellow do not be uneasy Leonora has received a pair of diamond earrings worth ten watches such as yours  David  O my dear Mr Vincent how I thank you  Mr Vincent  And I shall not confine my friendship and affection to the gift of such a trifle  David  O my generous friend and father  Mr Vincent  I observe with grief that her education cannot but be the cause of sorrow to her hereafter  David  So I likewise fear sir my dear aunt imagines that a little drawing dancing singing and the like are all that she wants to be happy in the world  Mr Vincent  To these frivolous embellishments then she sacrifices the much more important cultivation of her understanding and forbears inspiring her with those good qualities which have alone a claim on human approbation As your sister's reason has been so neglected she is pleased with those applauses that are offered on the altar of her vanity But when in some few years she sees how many useful matters of instruction and how much inestimable time she has for ever lost she will inevitably blush at her own conduct and even execrate her flatterers who on their side will repay her hatred with their ridicule and scorn  David  O sir you make me tremble for my poor dear sister  Mr Vincent  And besides what reasonable man will take up with a wife whose want of knowledge is so glaring who instead of being able to establish order and oeconomy within a house must dissipate the greatest fortune by her love of luxury and who will have an incapacity no less unworthy the esteem of him that is to be her husband than the veneration of his children She must of necessity be as a stranger in the world to every one about her What would such a woman do without my friendship  David  O dear sir let me beseech you do not take away your favour from her  Mr Vincent  No for on the contrary I am now upon the point of doing something for her  David  Yes dear sir procure her a more useful education Leonora does not want for understanding or good principles  Mr Vincent  I would with all my heart but at her age can one expect that she will submit to any rigid treatment after the indulgence that she has received at home No no I see it will be better to determine upon something for her benefit which shall take place when I am in my grave  David  For heaven's sake sir do not speak so I beseech you No I trust you are to live much longer for our common good and Providence will not so soon deprive us of our second father  Mr Vincent  I am sensible of your affection but the fear of death will not delay the fatal moment of its coming Leonora's future lot gives me pain whenever I reflect on what it may be and in short I am resolved to give her my whole fortune that at least she may have wherewithal to keep herself from want  David  taking Mr Vincent's hand  Oh thank you ten times over How rejoiced I am sir Shall I leave you for a moment and go tell her this good news But no it will be better to conceal it from her or at least till she has been induced to get some useful knowledge from a notion that she must live in future by her industry She will by that means know much better how to manage what you give her O my dearest Leonora after all then I may hope to see you happy  Mr Vincent  Worthy little fellow I am no less delighted with your generosity than understanding Come to my arms my dear child Could I intend to give your sister every thing and leave you nothing That were to the last degree unjust and therefore I revoke my first intention It is you that  should  be my sole heir and with propriety I ought to make my will accordingly  David  No no dear sir preserve your first intention and give Leonora all your fortune I shall be much more diligent in my improvement and more anxious to acquire useful knowledge which I doubt not with God's blessing will suffice for my advancement  Mr Vincent  Do not be uneasy with regard to Leonora When I said that you should be my sole heir it was not my idea that Leonora should be left without a trifling legacy sufficient to obtain her necessary things  David  Well then let us exchange the trifling legacy for me by way of token from you and the rest for Leonora  SCENE the last  Mr Vincent David Leonora coming out of the closet and running to embrace her brother  Leonora  O my dearest brother have I merited so much affection from you  David  Yes dear sister if you will but do as I could wish and be what our good benefactor so much longs to see you  Leonora  If Should it be a question I  will  be so I discern how much the difference of our education has exalted your ideas above mine though I am so much older My good friend and father let my future fortune be whatever you think proper I can never be unhappy if I leave you to determine for me I desire instruction likewise and will take my brother for a model  Mr Vincent  You will unavoidably be happy if you keep this prudent resolution But pray tell me whence proceeds this change in your ideas  Leonora  I have just heard my brother's wishes for me his disinterestedness and generous sacrifice I have heard too how  you  love me I will reverence you for the future and give up the little jealousies that I entertained against my brother He shall be my guide and friend  David  I will endeavour to be such dear sister it will be my boast and pleasure if I prosper  Mr Vincent  With what pleasing sentiments dear children do you inspire me I am now no longer sorry that Providence has left me childless I consider you no less affectionately than I should do had I given you life and think that I see your father who looks down from heaven well pleased in having left me such dear pledges of his love  Leonora and her brother take him by the hand and bathe it with their tears  Leonora  Let us not lose a moment sir Where does that worthy gentlewoman live whom you mentioned to me as a person that would teach me useful things  Mr Vincent  I will introduce you to her shortly I shall st  y here  ome few days and will endeavour to bring over if I can your aunt not all at once but by degrees to second my designs You must be careful not to anger or displease her She deserves your gratitude She has but erred respecting what was likely to insure your happiness her wish was not the less to make you happy  Leonora  I believe so but renounce from henceforth all the nonsense that I have been put to study No more dancing no more drawing no more musick for the future  Mr Vincent  No dear Leonora that would be wrong again On the contrary you ought to cultivate them for in truth they are desirable accomplishments Only remember that they do not constitute all the merit that is required in a woman They may render her more welcome in good company be a relaxation to her after the cares attendant on a house and family and make her still more fond of living in retirement add another tie to the attachment of her husband guide her in the choice of masters for her children and enable her to further their improvement They are only prejudicial when they feed her vanity and make her give into a fatal dissipation or contempt of duties in that state of life to which God's providence has called her They are flowers in short that may possess some little portion of one's garden if the rest be set apart for fruits and vegetables  THE GOOD MOTHER  A SONNET  THE mother's tender heart round whom  Her children throng in youthful bloom  With love and transport overflows  Such as a mother only knows  What time her light descending hand  Gently taps one with action bland  Another to her heart's close folds  Inmate already there she holds  A third climbs joyous on her knee  While pleas'd the little thing to see  Her hand assists and with a smile  Kissing she pays the arduous toil  Her foot held out to serve as chair  Dandles a fourth when seated there  So too the rest if more there be  Round her close cling her progeny  She reads all written in their eyes  Their looks caresses smiles and sighs  These speaking from the heart declare  The thousand little wishes there  Their prattle all at once is heard  And she replies without a word  For smiles alone are her reply  While joyous they stand prating by  Yet if it chance a word amiss  A quarrel for the envied kiss  Or aught unfit to hear or view  Among the little ones ensue  A brow dissatisfied she takes  Yet soon the low'ring storm there breaks  And while ev'n gloom o'ercasts her mien  That she's a mother 'tis well seen  In this so obvious to man's sense  We see God's wond'rous providence  That from the stores of heavenly grace  Pours gifts on all the human race  The rich in fortune's lap high fed  The poor beneath their lowly shed  All on her smile subsist and share  The blessings of her guardian care  She knows their need she hears their cry  And views them with a mother's eye  To none among her children blind  But scattering gifts on all mankind  Let none then with presumptuous sense  Dare tax the rule of Providence  With rigorous or even partial views  If for a season she refuse  Some blessing to their heart thought dear  As if averse their praver to hear  For their soul's good God's gracious will  Seems to subject them thus to ill  That through affliction's rigid ways  They may attain fair Virtue's praise  Or rather for such love we find  In his compassionating mind  When he vouchsafes them or denies  No less beneficent he is than wife  THE PROPER USE OF TIME  MORGAN though a plain companion was a special workman He aspired at nothing in his heart so much as to become a master but he wanted money to set up  A merchant who was well acquainted with his industry was willing to supply him with an hundred pounds that he might open shop  One may without much difficulty guess at Morgan's joy In his imagination he already had a warehouse full of goods He reckoned up how many customers would crowd to buy them and what money he should have at balancing his books  Amidst the extravagant emotions of that transport into which these notions threw him he perceived an alehouse Come said he and entered it I will have a little pleasure with one sixpence of this money  He demurred however some few moments to call out for punch which was his favourite liquor as his conscience loudly told him that the moment of enjoyment was not yet arrived that he was first of all to think of paying what his friend had lent him and at present that it was not honest for him to lay out a penny of the sum for things not absolutely necessary He was ready to come out again impressed by such right notions but bethought himself on the other hand that if he spent a sixpence of his money he should still have ninetynine pounds nineteen shillings and a sixpence left that such a sum was full enough to set him up in trade and that a single halfhour's industry would compensate for such a trifling pleasure as he wished to have at present  It was thus that taking up the glass he sought to quiet his interior scruples but alas his present conduct was to open him a door to ruin  On the morrow so agreeable a recollection of his pleasure at the alehouse filled his mind that he was now less scrupulous with conscience in expentling one more sixpence at it He had ninetynine pounds nineteen shillings still remaining  On the following days the love of liquor had besotted him in such a manner that he constantly returned to his beloved alehouse but increased the quantum of his liquor to a shilling's worth at first then sixpence more and so on till he came to halfacrown at which he seemed to make a stand and every time he could console himself with saying It is but twoandsixpence that I am spending Oh I need not fear but I shall have enough to carry on my trade  Such then was his delusive way of reasoning in reply to what his conscience whispered which would now and then be heard It did not strike him that his fortune was an even hundred pounds and that the useful application of the whole depended on the fit employ to which he put its parts  You see then my dear little friends how by insensible gradation he at length plunged into a life of extravagance He found no longer any joy in industry employed entirely as he was in contemplating on his present riches which he fancied inexhaustible and yet from day to day he did not fail to find that it was diminishing He was convinced and his conviction all at once came over him just like a clap of thunder that he could not make amends for his preceding dissipation as his benefactor would not be so fond of lending him another hundred pounds when he had seen him so misuse the first  Quite overcome with shame and grief the more he sought to stifle his ideas with hard drinking so much the sooner by a great deal did his ruin fall upon him And at last the frightful moment came when quite disgusted at the thought of industry and being as it were an object of horror to himself he regarded life as a burthen since it presented him with nothing but a prospect of miserable poverty whenever he looked forward  He renounced his country followed by despair and joined a gang of smugglers formidable for the ravages which they spread through every country on the coast But Heaven did not permit their violence to remain long unpunished A disgraceful death soon ended his career of wickedness  Alas if when his reason first of all addressed him he had listened to the reproaches of his conscience easy in  his situation he might now have been enjoying in repute and honour the ease of a respectable and opulent old age  You shudder children at his lamentable folly Such is notwithstanding that of multitudes among us in the use which they make of life It was bestowed upon them that they might live happy in virtuous enjoyments and yet they lavish it upon every shameful dissipation They think that there will always be time enough left them for the proper use thereof However in the interval days months and years flow onward and they find at the conclusion of them they have not made such a use as they fondly proposed In some sort they are even happy if their conduct does not plunge them finally into despair  THE BLACKSMITH  A Gentleman of fortune passing very late one night before a blacksmith's habitation was surprized to see him busy at his forge when every person in the neighbourhood was gone to rest He had a curiosity to know what reason he could have for working thus at midnight and if twelve hours labour in the day would not suffice him to provide subsistence for his family  I do not work for myself replied the blacksmith but for a neighbour here of mine who has unfortunately been burnt out I rise two hours before the usual time of labour every morning and continue working two hours after at at least and sometimes longer as is now the case and this I do that I may help him in his destitute condition If I had but any thing myself I would divide it with him but my all is nothing except this shop and some small stock of metal which I cannot sell because it is what subsists me Thus I work every day four hours extraordinary which amounts to two days in the course of a week and the earnings of those two days I can yield to him Thank heaven at this time of the year there is  work enough and while I have but strength it is my duty to assist the unhappy  This is very generous my good friend on your part said the gentleman as I suppose your neighbour never will be able to repay your kindness  Truly sir I fear he will not but I fear it on his account alone not mine However I am sure he would rejoice to do as much for me were I in his condition  At these words the gentleman not wishing to intrude upon the blacksmith any longer wished him a good night and went away  Upon the morrow having put into his purse a note for twenty pounds which he could afford to give away he went out and meant to leave it with the blacksmith whose beneficence he was resolved to recompence by putting it in his power to buy whatever metal he might want at the cheapest market to undertake more business and to lay by a little from his labour to support him in old age  But what was his surprize when the blacksmith bade him take his money back again I cannot lay it out said he because I have not earned it I can well afford to pay for all the iron that I use and if ever I should be in want of more the merchant would supply me with it on my note It would be absolute ingratitude in me to take that profit from him which he is used to make upon his goods when he has never hesitated to supply me with as much as I could ask even when I had no other coat than that upon my back but you may make a better use sir of this money if you lend it free of interest to my unhappy neighbour He might then recover his affairs and I sleep out my belly full  The gentleman with all his rhetoric not being able to prevail upon the blacksmith to accept his offer followed the advice that he gave him and was highly gratified in thinking that he had made two happy when at first his generosity had wished to serve one only  THE GENEROUS ORPHAN  MRS Fairborne had hardly lost her husband when a law suit in which he had been engaged was determined to her disadvantage the greatest part of her possessions being dependent on the verdict She was under the necessity of selling all her furniture and some few jewels after which when she had placed the produce at a banker's she withdrew into a village where the necessary things of life were not so high and where she apprehended that she might live with tolerable decency upon her trifling income  Hardly had she passed a month or two in her retreat before she was given to understand that her banker was gone off and all her money with him Let any one imagine the horror of her situation Grief and sickness had long since disabled her from doing any thing like labour for her livelihood and after having passed her youth in ease and pleasure she had no resources left her in old age except an almshouse or the common refuge of the poor beggary  In reality there was not one of her acquaintance who would condescend to have the least degree of interest in her sufferings Brought by her beloved husband from a foreign country she had no one to whom she could fly for assistance None except a tolerably near relation whom she herself had brought to England and whom by granting him her husband's credit she had rendered wealthy But this man a pattern of sordid avarice was not likely to relieve another when he would not even allow himself the necessary things of life  In this helpless situation there was luckily one resource still left for her subsistence In the years of her prosperity she had adopted a young female orphan named Clarinda and she now became her guardian angel Mrs Fairborne's former kindnesses inspired her with a wish of shewing that she was grateful for them  No said she when her unhappy mistress mentioned her design of seeking the asylum of a parish workhouse I will never leave you From your tenderness I formerly  received the treatment of a child and if in your prosperity I thought it so desirable to be related to you by adoption I still think it more so now in your adversity  Thank Heaven and your adoption I live comfortably Your maternal conduct was evinced in teaching me all necessary female arts I shall at present therefore look upon it as a boast that I can exercise my knowledge for your sake With health and courage I shall be at least enabled to procure a living for us both  The unhappy widow was exceedingly affected at this generous offer She embraced Clarinda and with joy consented to accept it  We are now then to suppose Clarinda in her turn become the mother by adoption of her former benefactress She was far from thinking it enough to feed her with the produce of an unremitting labour she consoled her in affliction aided her in sickness and endeavoured by the tenderest cares to make up for all the injustice of her lot  The constancy and ardour of her attention did not relax a moment for two years in which long time her mistress was made happy by her bounty and when death removed her she lamented with sincerity what she considered as a grievous loss  Some little season af  er this died also the kinsman abovementioned who had shewn himself so utterly insensible to every claim of gratitude and kindred As he could not take his money with him he supposed it would be making some atonement for his want of natural affection if he left the injured lady all his fortune  But this succour came too late as Mrs Fairborne was not able to avail herself thereof she had not even the consolation at her death of knowing that such a change had happened in her fortune as in that case she might easily have turned it to the benefit of her affectionate Clarinda  The inheritance in question therefore fell for want of heirship to the King As Providence would have it the enquiries made on such a rare occurrence brought him to a knowledge of the generous orphan's conduct  Ah said he Clarinda merits this inheritance and therefore I renounce my rights to favour her's and will be happy to approve myself her friend and father  All the nation joined in the applause of such a liberal action and Clarinda when possessed of this honourable recompence of her gratitude employed it in maintaining orphans such as she had been and took the greatest pleasure in inspiring them with sentiments like those by which she had herself deserved her fortune  THE DIRTY BOOTS  FORTUNATUS proud of his high birth was not content with inwardly despising every one inferior to himself in point of fortune but presumed to take such airs upon him as evinced the scorn with which he viewed them As it chanced one day he saw his father's footman cleaning shoes Fooh what a filthy business cried he as he passed him turning up his nose for all the world I would not be a shoeblackVery likely said John and I for my part hope that I shall never be  your  shoeblack  All the last week's weather had been very bad but now it was grown clear and bright on which account young Fortunatus received his father's permission to take a ride on horseback Now the promise of this ride afforded him the greater pleasure as the day before when he was out he had been hindered by a heavy shower of rain from going far However he had been already far enough to splash his boots from top to bottom and they were not yet quite dry  Transported with the thought of his ride he ran down to John who was at breakfast in the kitchen and with an imperious tone of voice cried out "John John I am going out on horseback Run and clean my bo  ts do you hear me" John pretended that he did not and continued at his breakfast quite composed In vain Fortunatus put himself into a passion and called him a hundred names John contented himself with answering him  very calmly "I have told you sir already if you recollect that I hoped never to become  your  shoeblack"  In the mean time Fortunatus seeing he could not in spite of all his menaces prevail upon John to do as he desired returned quite full of rage and made complaint about him to his father Mr Railton could not comprehend why John refused a business that belonged to his employment and which hitherto he had performed without expecting orders for that purpose so he sent to speak a little with him and was told of the affair  His conduct was fully approved by Mr Railton who not only blamed his son but told him that he might go and clean his boots himself or stay at home which ever he thought proper He forbade the other servants to assist him in this business "You will learn sir added he how filly it is to look with scorn on services that contribute to our comfort and convenience services the rigour of which you should rather strive to soften by a gentleness of manners in yourself Therefore since a  shoeblack's  trade is so disgraceful be so kind as to ennoble it by being for the future your own shoeblack"  Such a sentence turned his promised pleasure into sorrow He was very eager for a ride on horseback it was such fine weather butto clean his boots himself he could not stoop to such an office On the other hand his pride would not permit him to go out with dirty boots in which case every one that he met would ridicule him He applied successively to every servant in the house with offers of money to corrupt them but not one could be persuaded to disobey his master's order Thus then Fortunatus was obliged to stay at home till in the end his pride permitted him to stoop so low as the conditions laid upon him On the next day John resumed his office without bidding and the humbled Fortunatus having exercised it once would never afterwards gratify his pride by vilifying what was in itself so useful  THE TATLER  AURELIA though sufficiently goodtempered had contracted one great fault and that was calumny She published every where whatever she perceived amiss in others though they were her dearest friends The inexperience of her age induced her very often to ascribe indifferent actions to improper motives and a single word or volatility of disposition was enough to make her form the worst suspicions which as soon as she had formed them she would run into company and broach as if they were undoubted facts She frequently even added circumstances to them drawn from her imagination only with a view of making them more likely You may easily conceive what mischiefs such a conduct must produce It was not long before one family was set against another in her neighbourhood The discord afterwards affected individuals wives and husbands brothers masters and domestics were at everlasting variance with each other Mutual confidence was on a sudden done away from those whose company the little girl frequented with her mother People went so far at last as to shut up their doors against her as they would have done against a wretched creature tainted with the plague but neither hatred nor humiliation could correct a vice which custom had so deeply rivetted within her heart  This glory was reserved for Dorinda her cousin who was the only person now that would receive her visits and return them as she always lived in hopes of being able in the end to shew her the enormity of her behaviour and preserve her life from sorrow  Miss Aurelia went one day to see her cousin and employed an hour or two in telling spiteful tales of all their common friends although she knew with what uneasiness her cousin heard them It was all the same to her  And now dear Dorinda said Miss Aurelia having stopped for want of breath your turn is come to tell me something You see company enough to have a stock of little anecdotes at all times ready on your hands  My dear Aurelia answered Dorinda whenever I am visiting my friends I wish to taste the pleasure of their company and am not such an idiot as to lose it by remarking their defects Besides I find within myself so many that I cannot possibly have time to think of those in others having every need of their indulgence I am wise enough to grant them mine I rather chuse to rivet my attention upon every commendable quality which they possess and so endeavour to acquire it One must be in a faultless state one's self before one can proceed to note the faults of others I congratulate you on this faultless state which I on the contrary am so unhappy as to want Continue cousin this employment of a charitable censor who would lead mankind to virtue by exposing the deformity of vice You cannot fail of meriting the esteem of others for such generous cares  Aurelia could not fail of being conscious that she was long are this become a public object of aversion and disgust and therefore felt the severity of her cousin's sarcasm She began from that day forward to reflect with real seriousness upon the danger of her indiscretion She even trembled at the recollection of those mischiefs that she had caused and now determined to prevent their progress It was difficult in the beginning to throw off a custom which she had long indulged of beholding things on the unfavourable side but what can withstand a steady resolution In the end she was so totally reformed that she applied her penetration to such objects only as deserved applause and the detestable enjoyments of malignity within her were succeeded by a purer satisfaction She was now become the first to set equivocal or doubtful actions in such points of view that others might excuse them When she could not put them in a favourable light it is likely she would say I do not know every circumstance attending them no doubt there were commendable motives such as I am not acquainted with In short whenever as it sometimes chanced the case would not admit of any thing approaching to the nature of indulgence she would pity the offending person and impute her fault to too great precipitation or ignorance of the mischief that she was committing  However it was very long indeed before she could regain those hearts which her former manners had alienated She was come by this time to the age when most young women think of being settled but could see no prospect of a husband People had avoided her with so much care for years that now she seemed as much forgotten as if she had withdrawn herself into a convent from the world  No wonder then that she should suppose herself condemned to pass her days in solitude deprived of all those pleasures which accompany a happy marriage and the enjoyment of a chosen set of friends but fortune determined otherwise for a gentleman who came upon a visit to her father having heard her generously undertake to shield the reputation of an absent person whom some one in the company accused was so delighted with a goodness like his own as to conclude that she was exactly of the turn of mind that would make him happy He solicited her hand and made her mistress in return both of his heart and his fortune  Aurelia more and more convinced of the pernicious consequences of blazing other people's faults and the delightful satisfaction which selfesteem and the respect of worthy people cannot but bestowof worthy people repeat who wink at the defects of human natureevery day proposes her example to his children to preserve them from the ruin that she had nearly suffered  She has given me leave to write her story in this book for the instruction of my little friends if there be any like her who may read it I for my part know not whether there are any such but if there should be I persuade myself that after the instruction of this story they will be the better for it  THE PROVIDENT FATHER  The Father  THIS is the first time Charles that I have had the opportunity of being alone with you  Charles kisses his father who in turn embraces him  What have you been doing ever since our separation  Charles  I have been incessantly tormented with a thousand projects that have constantly destroyed each other I have everlastingly been working hard yet doing nothing like a multitude of other young people of an ardent imagination who as yet have no employ to take up their attention  The Father  I am pleased to find you wish for employment and a settled state but Charles we ought to wait till such time as the tree is come to its full strength if we would wish it should bear fruit  Charles  Do parts and wisdom constantly accompany a certain age Is it so very strange to see a young man not even in his twentieth year  The Father  Have much more knowledge and intrinsic merit than old men bent down beneath the weight of old ageAgreed but then it is very rare to see at such a tender age that strength of character which makes man active  Charles  But there must surely be a time when a young man  is an irresistible degree of strength that carries him along a devouring fire consumes us and I for my part feel a strength within me which I think equal to the labour of removing mountains  The Father  And then you enter into a world where nothing of that sort exists where every step that you take is limited where you have constantly to combat envy fordid interest caprice brutal stupidity and illiberal prejudice Believe me the most active virtue and an upright heart can never hope to prove successful if the has not therewithal an indefatigable constancy and a  stration almost divine to scrutinize deceit and villainy  d if these qualities are so rare even in the wisest men how can we hope to find them in the restless unsettled minds of youthDo you know to what I compare this  inward consciousness of your strength To a torch that will indifferently carry you before children women and old men but which the first breath of wind will infallibly put out I would have the strength of manhood to concentrate in the heart as fire within the substance of a stone eternally invisible when once it is struck the eye is sure of seeing sparks come forth However what I say is not to shew that I ought to let you pass your time away unoccupied At present I am even so happy as to have procured you an employ  Charles  An employ O sir how much I thank you  The Father  Be persuaded that the greatest joy which a father can possess is to make his children happy  Charles  I assure you if ever industry and what is more a proper disposition are rewarded with success you shall not have to blush for my behaviour  The Father  I rely indeed upon your zeal sufficiently to be persuaded that at no time you will look on any occupation as unworthy of your care for even the slightest inattention in you may draw after it the worst consequences  Charles  I am sensible how much the honour of my king and country requires at my hands  The Father  Such honour is a great affair dear Charles and should entirely occupy a feeling and an upright heart and that your sentiments may always be adapted to each circumstance observe and study what we call the genius of the nation do whatever you are able to discover both its strength and weakness and consult incessantly those most advanced in years whose age has ripened their experience Thus Charles you will never have to fear a misemployment of your knowledge which is too frequently the fault of young men even such as have the best propensities  Charles  I have formed myself I think dear father on the surest principles  The Father  Take care how you establish novel systems but attack all prejudice and not that only but injustice likewise Be assiduous to eradicate them from the hearts of men In general never publish your designs before the proper time and build not up your reputation on the ruins of a rival Censure no one but proceed in silence to the execution of your enterprizes  Charles  I have frequently remarked that the desire of imitating upon one hand and of blaming on the other hand are very common faults and that enthusiastic imitators and malignant critics are quite indolent while they announce themselves to others with a deal of disgusting pomp and bustle  The Father  I should even likeBut I am too verbose It is a father's heart that now lays itself open  Charles  O my father can you possibly supply the son that loves you and is so loved by you with too many guides considering that he is really so inexperienced and has such a high career displayed before him For your salutary counsels shall be always my directors  The Father  Well my child then have a veneration and regard for truth that is the base of every principle of action Never labour to establish even public welfare by improper measures and if ever any one should offer to persuade you to it on pretences of necessity abandon him to his remorse and look upon him as an enemy not openly perhaps but so in secret to his king and country  Charles  How my heart is lightened of a burthen that oppressed it and how earnestly I mean to put in practice for the welfare of my sovereign all the observations that I have made With how much zeal and ardour I intend to raise my voice against abuses  The Father  Very well But then think think my son that men in vain aspire to reach perfection and remember always that the greatest art the greatest effort of men's genius is amongst many inconveniencies to chuse the least  Charles  Aided by your counsel and experience I shall soon arrive at some more eleva  ed situation  The Father  I should rather chuse that you would endeavour to become an useful man To be continually going forward and to quit one place where we may frequently be necessary with the view of filling up another where we shall not prove of so much use is to betray our country and to cheapen and degrade our merit To be great is to be nothing more than what we should be And yet after all do not imagine that proceeding in this manner you will never meet with obstacles You  will it is very likely fail at last oppressed beneath the burthen of those benefits that you have conferred and be condemned to live unknown and calumny will put upon your best intentions sinister interpretations Be not however upon this account discouraged but pursue your plans with firmness for a time will come when your assistance will be sought And should even this your expectation in itself so just be disappointed in such case the consciousness of your integrity will be your recompence and consolation  JULIAN AND ROSINA  ONCE upon a time a certain Mr Lorimer was reading in a corner of his parlour while his wife and daughter were employed in silence at their tambourframe when on a sudden their little Julian entered hastily quite out of breath his eye brimfull of tears his hair in great disorder and one stocking down upon his heel He had a raquet in his hand and as he entered he cried out Come mama do pray and see the mother of poor Christopher and Frederic Alas they have not had a bit of any thing to eat all day Frederic asked me to play with him at shuttlecock to make him forget as he said that he was hungry and they do not know how they shall get any thing before tomorrow evening at the soonest I would fain have given them all the money in my purse but would you think it they refused it I made answer Come with me and you shall seeNo no said they we are already so obliged to your mama and dare not go again to teaze her Then too their poor mother hearing this burst out a weepingBut I must not cry said Julian crying still more as my papa is reading Ah Rosina had you seen them you would certainly have cried as much as I and stooping as he spoke he laid hold of Rosina's apron by the corner to wipe his eyes  The mother melted into tears at this recital and the little boy's behaviour thereupon dropped her needle  and the father to conceal a tear held up his book before him  Come dear children then said Mrs Lorimer embracing Julian and Rosina with affection come and let us see if we can help these three unhappy people  While Frederic Christopher and the afflicted mother knelt before their benefactress Rosina pulled her brother by the coat and in a whisper asked him if he recollected that nice little cake which their uncle gave them in the morning Yes said Julian and turned round as if he meant to run and fetch it Keep mama in conversation here and make believe as if you did not know that I was gone for I will run and fetch it No no said Rosina there is no need of that for look it is hereOn which the little lady lifting up poor Frederic's hat that lay accidentally on the table shewed her brother the nice little cake which she had watched the opportunity of slipping underneath it  THE SEPARATION  The Father and his Son in Law entering at opposite doors  The Son in Law  HAVE you considered my proposals  The Father in Law  No for there is nothing to consider When a couple who have sworn everlasting love to one another in the church and whom a child the fruit of their reciprocal affection would compel as one might think to the observance of their vows proceed so far as to a separation what is left then to consider What can one do  The Son in Law  However I am so determined in my resolution that it rests upon some few formalities and nothing more to be compleat  The Father in Law  ringing  Well be it so  A servant enters  Tell my daughter she is wanted  The servant is withdrawing but the father calls him back and whispers something to him  The Son in Law  Do you approve of the allowance that I design to make her  The Father in Law  That shall be as you yourself think fit I take my daughter home and hope that she will never want  The Son in Law  However it is proper that we should come to some agreement  The Father in Law  Very well do you adjust that matter as you please  The Son in Law  taking up a pen  It will be done almost as soon as said  He sits down to write  Sophia enters  The Father in Law  You guess no doubt why I have sent for you  Sophia  Yes and as things have been carried thus far I have expected the arrival of this moment with a deal of pleasure  The Father in Law  You resolve then to occasion me this grief  Sophia  I cannot possibly consent to live any longer with him  The Son in Law  getting up and putting a paper into his father's hand  This is my agreement  The Father in Law  By this then you renounce each other mutually you sir agreeing to pay this lady four hundred pounds a year Is this agreed on both sides  Sophia  Upon mine it is  The Son in Law  No doubt  The Father in Law  It is useless for me to remonstrate any longer  Sophia  Indeed sir it is unnecessary  The Son in Law  My resolution is fixed  The Father in Law  Then whatever I might wish I am necessitated to consent Go sign this paper  They sign  Soall is settled There is notwithstanding one great difficulty yet With which of you pray is the child to be  Sophia  I am his mother  The Son in Law  speaking at the same moment  I his father  The Father in Law  True your rights on either side are equal therefore  Sophia  I will lose my life much rather than my child  The Son in Law  The child is mine and I will never give him up  The Father in Law  Consider this dear children for this circumstance should teach nay force you to renounce your cruel purpose Hearts that are engrossed by one and the same child as yours are cannot sure be enemies to one another and it is only a misunderstanding that subsists between you  He takes the paper  Shall I tear it  The Son in Law  If you do  Sophia  By no means father  The Father in Law  However it is necessary that you should come to something of a resolution on this head Do you consent that Charles shall stay with which of you he pleases  Sophia  Yes with all my heart  The Son in Law  And mine too  The father in law goes out  The Son in Law  For my part it will give me pleasure if I hear you are happy as I part without the least resentment in my heart  Sophia  And I too wish that you may hereafter be as happy as you have been hitherto though I am sure you will not  The father in law returns with the child the mother clasps him in her arms and says  Won't you stay with me my dear  The Child  Oh yes mama  The Son in Law  embracing him  You wish to leave me then my precious little fellow  The Child  No no papa I will stay with you too  The Father in Law  But my dear your papa and mama design to part for ever and you must absolutely tell them which you wish to live with  Sophia  You will live with me my sweetest won't you Speak  The Son in Law  With me my child  The Child  With both of you  They turn away the father has his eyes fixed on them during some short pause  But why do you both turn away Why look so melancholy You were used  o be so merry in each other's company  He pulls them towards each other  You shall not  go I will live with you both at once  The son in law and mother stooping both at once to embrace their child meet one another and looking at each other affectionately embrace  The Father in Law  I thank thee Nature Thou hast not forsaken me  The Son in Law  Will you forget the past  Sophia  Yes every thing  They embrace again with transport  The Father in Law  holding out the child that they may both caress him  Are you determined now to part  Sophia  No father never  The Son in Law  This tender tie shall reunite us now for ever I will love you for the time to come and we will both be happy  The Father in Law  wiping his eyes  I weep but it is for joy at such a reconcilement  THE SCHOOL FOR STEPMOTHERS  A DRAMA in One ACT  CHARACTERS  Mr and Mrs FLOYD  FRANCIS  Mr Floyd's Children  PRISCILLA  Mr Floyd's Children  ANNE  Mr Floyd's Children  CHARLES  Mrs Floyd's Children  PERCIVAL  Mrs Floyd's Children  DANIEL  a Servant  The  SCENE  is in Mr Floyd's garden  SCENE I  Francis  alone  ONCE more then I am in my garden where I have not been these six months What a pleasure every object gives me Here is the little summerhouse where I was used so frequently to breakfast  with my dear mama If she were living still what happiness for both of us She would receive me now with open arms she would embrace me and on my side I should have many little things to tell her But alas  beginning to cry  I have for ever lost her and if we are still to love each other we can only do so in another world My dear mama could you only hear me it would be some comfort since you cannot come back to see your Frank Instead of you I have indeed a mother but a mother as they call it in law and that as I am told is just as much as if one were to say a cruel mother What then am I now to do I never shall dare look upon her Oh if I might at least have lived with grandmama But no papa will have me here though poor mama is dead Alas I never shall be able to live here I know it I will therefore only see my dear papa and sisters and go back Yes yes I will go back and must  SCENE II  Francis Daniel  Daniel  What master Francis is it you come back again How goes it with you  Francis  In health not much amiss dear Daniel And how pray are you  Daniel  Quite well and not a penny for the apothecary out of me My draughts are made up for me at the  George  But what is the matter I can see you have been crying  Francis  wiping his eyes  Crying  Daniel  Yes yes crying Oh you cannot conceal it Have you met with any accident  Francis  None Daniel since I left my grandmama's  Daniel  Oh oh I understand you weep for your mama but then you have another  Francis  A stepmother you mean If I could only shun her But how fare my poor dear sisters  Daniel  How ah bad enough At six they must be up I would not advise them to lie a minute after They would pay dear for their drowsiness  Francis  But what have they to do up so early  Daniel  Oh their new mother knows how to find them work She rules us all like slaves and I myself must get up with the rest I rose at seven this morning and as early as it was I saw both your sisters hard at work in the parlour  Francis  But I ask you at what  Daniel  Why working for their young brothers in law  Francis  Yes I am told that second mothers never spare their husband's children while they love their own and I imagine I must go to work too But what is become of all my pinks and tulips  Daniel  Oh they are all taken away  Francis  By whom  Daniel  By Charles and his brother  Francis  So then I have lost my pretty flowers and those two wicked little fellows have destroyed them They have nothing now to do but take the garden from me likewise Look ye here they come  SCENE III  Francis Daniel Charles Percival  Charles  whispering Percival  Percival who is that young gentleman with Daniel If it were but Master Francis  Percival  whispering Daniel  Is it he  Daniel  answering drily  Yes gentlemen  Charles  O my dear dear brother welcome We have wished to see you  Francis  shrinking back  Have we been acquainted with each other long enough that you should thus embrace me  Charles  We are not acquainted with you I acknowledge but are all three brothers  Francis  Yes half brothers sir  Charles  Why half If your papa loves our mama and she loves him why should not we love one another They are man and wife and we are therefore brothers  Francis  If we are brothers have you a greater right than I have here  Percival  aside  How quarrelsome he is  Charles  Why your papa has let us work these three weeks in it  Francis  I was in it first and surely you will not drive me out  Percival  Come Charles let us be gone and leave him in his peevish humour  Charles  No no Percival we must stay and be good friends with one another  Percival  Do you like the sulky fellow then so much  Francis  The sulky fellow Do you call me sulky  Percival  Yes and envious and  Francis  You dare insult me then and even in my garden here  Percival  You began but I am your match mind that  Charles  Hear me Percival Would you strike your brother Come along and for Heaven's sake let us not vex our new papa and more particularly so the very day that he is to see his son  He draws him away  Percival  Well I will go and tell mama  He and Charles both go out  SCENE IV  Francis Daniel  Francis  See now if my anxieties are not beginning They will tell their mother that I have insulted them and she will get me anger from papa Unhappy as I am do not you think Daniel that I am to be pitied  Daniel  Indeed you are so however take heart I will be your friend and we shall then I think be able to make head against them  Francis  Yes but my papa  Daniel  Let me alone with him I know a thousand tricks of these new comers which I will tell him They have spoilt your garden killed your flowers and called you names I warrant you they will be but badly off  Francis  So then my good Daniel you will stand up for me  Daniel  Ay as sure as my name is Daniel  Francis  Thank you thank you I am not without a friend I see then though I have lost mama But did  you notice their fine clothes What handsome waistcoats they had on Who worked them can you tell  Daniel  Their mother  Francis  Yes yes I was thinking so She will always be employed upon her favourites but pray who will work me such a waistcoat  Daniel  Why indeed if you should want one you must work it yourself  Francis  And had not they new coats on likewise  Daniel  Yes they had them as a present from your papa on the day of his marriage  Francis  Oh he did not make me such a present I was sent with these bad clothes into the country It is too much I cannot support the thought My poor mama is dead and my papa forgets me I have only you now left to befriend me  Daniel  Be of comfort matters may turn out much better than you think but in the first place you must see your new mama So follow me and think of putting on a chearful face as if you were rejoiced to see her  Francis  I can never do so  Daniel  But you  must  however it may go against you I do so though I detest her Would you think it she begins to tell me that I must be less frequent in my visits at the alehouse I that was accustomed to spend half the day there in the lifetime of my last dear mistress She indeed was quite a lady Things are marvellously altered now and we must alter with them Patience when we are once alone I will tell you what more is to be done At present therefore follow me  Francis  But will she see by my eyes that I have been crying  Daniel  Why you are crying still  Francis  Then I will not go now she would ask the reason of my tears What answer should I give her  Daniel  You might say that coming home you had been thinking of your dear mama and therefore fell a crying  Francis  But provided she should speak about my quarrel with her children  Daniel  Tell her that they began it and call me to witness what you say But here she comes Go and salute her boldly  SCENE IV  Mrs Floyd Francis  Mrs Floyd  Where where is he  Perceiving him  Is it you my dearest Francis Then I have all my family together at last  She embraces him with tenderness  How sweet a countenance and how happy am I that I can call so amiable a child my son  Francis  I should be happy too could I but rejoice and yet  sighing  Mrs Floyd  What is the matter then my dearest You seem quite sad my charming little man  Francis cries afresh and cannot speak a world  You turn away and cry What causes you these tears Won't you inform me what afflicts you  Francis  Nothing nothing  Mrs Floyd  It is enough however to distress me Say what gives you all this sorrow and I will comfort you if possible If your papa or sisters were to see you they might fancy that you had met with some misfortune coming home and they are pleased in thinking that they are so soon to see you Would it grieve you to embrace them  Francis  Believe me I can have no greater pleasure But shall I embrace mama It is for her that I cry  Mrs Floyd  She died six months ago and do you still cry for her  Francis  Yes yes all my life Oh my mama my dear mama  Mrs Floyd  Be calm my little dear Endeavour to divert your thoughts and let us speak of her no longer since it gives you so much sorrow  Francis  No no  on the contrary let me be always speaking of her if you mean that I should feel any comfort Would you have your children willing to forget you after you were dead so soon  Mrs Floyd  Dear little fellow  embracing him  You loved her then very much  Francis  I find so much more now than when she lived She was so good  Mrs Floyd  I wish I were but able to restore her to you which I cannot do and therefore I will take her place poor little fellow in your bosom I will love you as she did and will be a mother to you  Francis  But it never can be you that bore me fed me with your milk and brought me up She was my real mother and you only my stepmother  Mrs Floyd  But why give me such a name I have not called you my stepson  Francis  Pray pardon me I did not say so to displease you I begin to think you very kind at least you seem so But then you have children of your own and must of course love them much more than me  Mrs Floyd  You shall not find it so Some few days hence we shall be more acquainted with each other than we can be now and you shall see if my affection will not make you think yourself my son  Francis  If that indeed could be without forgetting my mama  Mrs Floyd  I would not wish you to forget her on the contrary we will speak often of her and your tenderness shall be a pattern for my children Come I long to introduce you to them  Francis  Oh I have seen them already Have they not complained of my behaviour  Mrs Floyd  No my little man Have you had any quarrel then I should be very sorry for that as all my wish is to behold you tenderly united to each other like real brothers  Francis  I wish nothing more than that But where is my papa and sisters Let me see them  Mrs Floyd  Your papa will very soon be home He went this morning to dispatch some business out of doors that he might have the afternoon entirely to himself but in the mean time I can take you to your sisters who will tell you what you are to think of me  Francis  I wish them to speak of you but not first I have a deal to say of my mama  As they go out Charles and Percival enter at the opposite side  SCENE VI  Charles Percival  Percival  Why did you keep me from complaining to mama I keep company with that little snarler No never When his father once comes home I will tell him what a waspish son he has that he may teach him to behave a little better  Charles  Do you think then that our papa will not be vexed when told of this same difference between you both and would it please you to afflict him  Percival  Certainly I should be sorry for it And yet what can I do since if this little gentleman is not corrected for his rudeness the first day of coming home there will be nothing but disputes hereafter He will be always affronting us I am not very deliberate in such cases I shall certainly be warm and tell him what he ought to know and if hereafter he should think of taking airs on him as just now  Charles  I hope then Percival you do not mean to beat him  Percival  But you do not suppose that I will let myself be beat by him  Charles  No certainly  Percival  Then what ought I to do  Charles  Tomorrow very likely we shall see but now it would be improper to disturb his father's satisfaction in seeing him  Percival  Be it now tomorrow or the following day it is all the same to Percival but the sooner in my thoughts the better  Charles  Brother I beseech you wait a little longer Francis cannot be so sulky as you think  Percival  And yet sure I know him as well as you  Charles  His father and his sisters say he is very condescending and goodnatured  Percival  Yes indeed he shewed his condescension and goodnature when he turned his back upon me in reply to my civility  Charles  That was not well but then he does not know us yet  Percival  He might have tried to know us  Charles  How you talk perhaps something grieved him  Percival  And are we to suffer for it  Charles  No but brothers must pass over many things which others have a right to take amiss  Percival  It appears to me that he scorns to look upon us as brothers  Charles  No I cannot persuade myself of that  Percival  Well let him look a little to himself I shall not put up with any insult from him But he's coming with his sisters I will withdraw I cannot endure the thoughts of such a snappish gentleman  Charles  For heaven's sake brother let us stay and share in their amusement  Percival  No no I might possibly disturb them and will go  Charles  If you are resolved I will follow you  Aside going out  I must do every thing in my power to soften him  SCENE VII  Francis Priscilla Anne  Priscilla  holding Francis by the hand  But why afflict yourself dear brother any longer Our afflictions cannot bring mama to life again  Francis  But will you promise me at least that we shall think a little of her every time we meet  Priscilla  Yes brother I shall always think I see her with us just as when she was alive  Francis  affectionately looking at them  My dearest sisters this idea doubles the delight that I have in seeing you  Priscilla  I and Anne have been wishing this long while to see you likewise  Anne  And so have I brother for now we can play all together as we used to do Charles and his brother can play with us too Oh how fine that will be  jumping for joy  Francis  Pshaw no more about your Charles and his brother if you love me  Priscilla  How  Francis  They would but interrupt our pastime they are good for nothing but to go complaining of us to their mother and convey away our things  Priscilla  They brother Can you think so badly of them  Anne  Look ye Frank  shewing at etwee  Francis  And who gave you that  Anne  Why Percival he went out and bought it for me with a crown that his mother gave him  Priscilla  See too this Morocco pocketbook It was a present made to Charles and he gave it me  Francis  Ay ay I see you understand each other's meaning and will all four be against me  Priscilla and Anne  Be against you  Francis  Certainly I know they hate me having taken all my flowers away and spoiled my garden  Priscilla  Who has taken all your flowers away and spoiled your garden  Francis  Those two little fellows that you seem to admire so much  Priscilla  We do not understand you Have you seen your garden  Francis  Have I seen it What a question Only look yourself Where are my pinks and tulips  Priscilla  Where you have not then been at the terrace under my mama's  bow  window  Francis  Is there any garden there  Anne  Ay surely and a very pretty one  Priscilla  Your garden here was far too little so mama had one marked out for all of us behind the terrace six times larger  Francis  And who owns it Doubtless your two favourites  Priscilla  No no it belongs to all of us we have each a portion  Anne  I as well as the rest  Francis  And is there one for me  Priscilla  Undoubtedly and you are luckier by a deal than we You have not taken any labour in the cultivation of your part which notwithstanding you will find quite full of flowers  Anne  Red yellow blue and white in plenty as you  ill see  Francis  Who set them for me  Anne  Why your brothers They have been a monthemploying all their play hours upon the work They have selected all the prettiest flowers that  their  beds supplied and put them into yours that at the time of your return you might be more surprised  Francis  And have they done all this for me Daniel told me that they had taken all my flowers away but did not tell me why  Priscilla  If you give ear to Daniel you will be worse off for it I can tell you Why he wished to make us quarrel with our brothers likewise How ungrateful Their mama consents to have him for no other reason than because ours begged papa upon her deathbed not to turn him off and all his study is to make her children as unhappy as he can  Anne  And all because mama will have him work instead of spending half the day with idle fellows at the alehouse  Francis  Is it so Then I begin to see that he wanted to deceive me when he promised to be my friend  Priscilla  However we must not tell any thing about it to papa he would dismiss him we must therefore carefully keep silence and not ruin Daniel  Francis  Oh no no indeed since poor mama had such a value for him  Priscilla  You will soon see whether he told you truth  Anne  But come now and pay a visit to your garden brother  Francis  Yes with all my heart I long to see it  Anne and Priscilla take him by the hand and go out on one side without perceiving Charles who comes in with Percival on another side  SCENE VIII  Charles Percival  They enter with two plates of cake and fruit which they put dawn upon a table in the summerhouse  Charles  But where is he  Percival  looking every way  Look ye there he is There brother with his sisters going to our garden  Charles  I am glad of that for only think what pleasure he will have when he discerns how busy we have been to ornament his portion of it  Percival  Do you think so I for my part would lay any wager that he will find fault with every thing about him he is so queer The flowers he will say are badly chosen or the box not planted as it should be or the ground too moist or too dry and twenty other circumstances  Charles  Yes but do you know that I am beginning to consider you as touchy as you fancy him I never saw you so before  Percival  It is he that caused it Have his sisters ever had occasion to complain of my behaviour and I only wish to live upon good terms with him You know with what impatience I expected his arrival here and how I ran with open arms to meet him  Charles  True indeed but as I said before it is very likely something grieves him He is afraid perhaps that his father will no longer love him or our mother shew  him  less affection than he fancies she does us If so then surely it is our duty to make much of him in his uneasiness and win him to be friends with us by every gentle method in our power  Percival  You are in the right I did not duly think of that  Charles  If he is as good as every body says think brother how a little kindness on our part will in the end affect him how his father will be fonder of us for it and what pleasure we shall give mama  Percival  I was in the wrong I own Let him but come and I will be so attentive to him he must unavoidably forget the past  Charles  What hinders us from running to him where he is The flowers that we planted for him will make peace between us  Percival  That is well said we will go immediately But here he comes himself  Charles  And see how pleased he seems  SCENE IX  Charles Percival Francis Priscilla Anne  Francis  running to embrace his brothers  My dear good friends my brothers you must certainly be very much displeased with my behaviour  Charles  We why so  Percival  It is over my dear Frank and I love you  Francis  What a pretty garden you have made me You have given me all your finest flowers without my having done any thing to give you pleasure  Charles  It is enough for us if you are pleased with our endeavours  Francis  If I am Forgive me pray dear brothers I insulted you I turned away when you came running to embrace me I will never do so for the future We will always be good friends and every thing that I have shall be yours as well as mine  Charles  Yes yes and every thing shall be in common to us not our pleasures only but our sorrows also  Percival  Let us then embrace each other and begin this friendship  They embrace  Charles  This is as it should be and now Frank we must go and have a little banquet that has been prepared for us by mama we have brought it and put it in the summerhouse as you may see Let us enter Enter you too sisters with us and sit down  Percival  It is your privilege dear brother now to do the honours of the feast Mama will have it so as you she says by your arrival are the founder of it  Francis  Oh I am sure I never shall have eaten any where with so much appetite as at this feast of friendship  He presents them with the cake and frait and they begin to eat  Percival  Well and is not this much better than to quarrel with each other  Anne  I believe so truly for what quarrel can be worth these pears  Charles  How glad mama will be to find us such friends with one another  Priscilla  She deserves that we should afford her all the joy possible When once you come to know herBut I remember you have seen her  Francis  Yes yes Priscilla she received me with the greatest kindness and has so agreeable a countenance that she cannot be ill tempered I perceived even by her tone of voice that I should be easily induced to love her  Priscilla  And how good she is to us  Anne  We need but please ourselves to give her pleasure  Priscilla  We were greatly to be pitied at the death of our mama Papa who is employed all day in business could not look to us There was for ever something wrong in our cloaths and our education was much more neglected  Anne  We should very probably have fallen into a habit of indolence  Priscilla  But since our new mama is come we are both set to rights She gives us every entertainment suited to our age and is a party with us in our little pleasures One would think her much more interested in the preservation of our health than of her own I have not yet had time sufficient to remark that I stand in need of any thing she makes beforehand such provision for our wants  Anne  But lately I was ill oh very ill indeed and it was herself that waited on me She was always by my bed and doing every thing in her power to comfort me She made up all manner of nice things and I believe I should have died but for her great attention to me  Francis  O my dear dear sisters is it possible  Priscilla  You know too brother that before you left us we had not been any ways accustomed to employ our needle Well mama was kind enough to teach us So that now we knownot only plain but every sort of fine work  Charles  to Francis  See here the neck and wristhands of this shirt Mama extols the work very much Well Priscilla did it all herself and it was a present from her to me  Priscilia  Which you merited beforehand for who made me such a garden or presented me with such fine nosegays  Brother Francis you must know mama will not have us oblige our brother unless they likewise oblige us and they do more to please us than we could have thought to ask  Anne  Yes indeed and as a proof I will shew you the cork boat of Percival's making with his penknife You shall see its nice sirk rigging satin fails and ribband streamers It swims charmingly in the fishpond  Percival  Since you made me such a handsome pair of garters  Anne  Garters I can make much better things than garters now Ah Frank were you but to see a certain green and lilac striped silk purse The green at least is all of my own fancying ask Priscilla else Oh I am sure you will be delighted when you have it  Francis  How and have you made me then a purse  Priscilla makes a sign that Anne should hold her peace  Anne  embarrassed  No Frank not for you  in a whisper  yes it is but you must know mama enjoined me not to tell you And besides she means to surprize you herself with nothing less than such a nice worked waistcoat as my brothers now have onOh you will soon see  Priscilla  This little giddy creature can keep no secret  Anne  No because there was such pleasure in revealing it We have been always thinking of you brother  Francis  Oh I thank you but pray tell me are you happy  Priscilla  Are we happy What is wanting in our situation Our mama is really so good I do not know how it is but she has found the secret of converting every thing into a sort of pleasure I have no amusement half so great as chattering with her Even while she is joking she instructs us  Anne  You should see us Francis when we are reading certain little tales which a friend of ours composes for us He knows what every little boy and girl does in the world and it would be comical if he were to put us in his book  Priscilla  I wish he would put us in it on account of our mama that all the world might know the goodness of her heart and how we love her  Charles  Yes and I too for the sake of our papa who treats us just as if we were even his real children  SCENE X  Mr Floyd Francis Priscilla Anne Charles Percival  Mr Floyd  who had stood by the side of the summerhouse during the whole preceding scene shews himself suddenly amongst them crying  Yes and so you are within my heart I make it all my happiness to think that I am your father But where is Frank  Francis  embracing Mr Floyd  Here papa Oh how rejoiced I am to see you dear papa  Mr Floyd  Kiss me once more my dear childAnd now let me inquire if you are pleased with your new brothers  Francis  Oh I never could have chosen better I will love them and do every thing in my power that they may love me likewise  Charles  There will be no difficulty in that matter since we are determined to do just the same  Percival  We shall but need to recollect the pleasure that we have had this day  Priscilla  That you may keep your promise I will be sure to put you frequently in mind thereof  Anne  Oh sister as to that I am sure I shall remember it without a monitor  Mr Floyd  I verily believe you will do so from what I have heard you say for you must know dear children I was planted here hard by in secret during all your conversation and I am sure I never shall forget it nor I only but another for another has heard every thing as well as I Come then dear spouse approach and enjoy a pleasure so adapted to your goodness  SCENE XI  Mr and Mrs Floyd Francis Priscilla Anne Charles Percival  Mr Floyd  Here she is my little ones the partner that I have chosen to promote your happiness and not yours only but my own The fortune which it might have  been in my power to leave to you would be nothing in comparison of that more valuable gift a good and proper education We have therefore made these second nuptials to procure you every possible advantage Three among you very much wanted a mother who might take upon her the care of your childhood and the other two a father to advance you in the world Your interests were the same in these second nuptials and it is for the benefit of all of us that they have been framed Do you then promise me dear spouse as I on my side do that you will never think of treating either of these children with the least degree of partiality except indeed what his superior good behaviour may appear to merit  Mrs Floyd  My reply to you dear husband is these tears I cannot possibly repress them and to you my children these embraces  she holds out her arms and all the children strive with one another to come closest to her  Mr Floyd  And do you dear little ones on your part promise to keep up a constant union with each other to avoid all jealousy and quarrels and like children of one parent love each other  They take each other by the hand and kneeling answer  Yes papa we do we do  Mr Floyd  raising them  Continue then to live in such a state of friendship You will find its charms constantly encrease and the tie between you grow closer every day You will be as happy from the services that you do each other as from those little sacrifices that may frequently be needful for the sake of peace among you Every one enjoying his own happiness will not the less enjoy his brother's which in fact he may attribute to himself There will not be an individual round about you but will interest himself in your prosperity if his solicitude be worth the acquisition and your future children will reward you by  their  tenderness for having so well merited the affection of your parents  THE MOUNTAIN LUTE  FROM the highest summit of those hills which overlook the vale of Lucca in Savoy I was contemplating the extended landscape round about me I was quite alone my faithful servant being left in a neighbouring city with orders not to expect me till at the end of three days which interval I meant to spend in rambling over that romantic country More than half way down the hill I saw a hamlet which assured me of a lodging for the night Thus free from all inquietude and swallowed up in thought I let my mind roam at large in contemp  ation and my eye to wander from one object to another of the spacious view But soon the sylvan choristers last song admonished me to think of retiring under cover for the night The sun already hid behind the opposite mountain did but colour with his gold and purple rays the clouds which floated as it were just close above the trees that crown its summit I descended slowly mortified to see the spacious horizon whose limits I could hardly trace contract itself as I proceeded The twilight now began to veil it with a shade which by degrees grew browner till the empress of the night dispelled this gloomy darkness with her silver beams I sat down for a moment to enjoy the picture Nothing intercepted my view throughout the vast expanse I contemplated the infinite extent at leisure From the trembling moon and stars which twinkled while I gazed upon them I passed over to the calm and spotless azure of the firmament The air was fresh nor did the slightest breeze disturb it Nature was absorbed in universal silence saving the low murmur of a stream which meandered through the country at a distance Stretched upon the grass I might perhaps have contemplated till the rising of the sun next morning but the music of a lute made more harmonious by a voice soon after struck upon my ear I thought at first that my ravished senses were deluded by the power of my imagination and experienced the delight of fancying myself suddenly transported in a dream to what are called the regions of enchantment In the midst of this illusion while both m  sies still continued A lute said I rising  a lute upon the mountain I turned round to that side whence the melody proceeded and discovered through the dark some verdure of the trees no great way distant the white walls and garden paling of a cottage I approached it with a beating heart but what was my surprize when I beheld a youthful peasant with a lute on which he was playing with exquisite address A woman seated on his  hand was looking at him with an eye of the tenderest affection At their feet upon the turf were many children boys and girls and ancient people all in attitudes of pleasure and attention When I first made my appearance several of the children came to meet me looked at one another and then said among themselves What gentleman is this The young musician turned his head but did not leave off playing I could not possibly withstand the first emotions of my heart I held him out my hand he gave me his which I laid hold of with a sort of transport Every body upon this rose and made a circle round us I informed them as concisely as I could do of my business in that quarter of the country and at such a time of night We have not an inn for many miles round remarked the youthful peasant as our hamlet is not near the road but if you are content to lie in a poor cabin we will do our best to entertain you  If at first I was astonished at his execution on the lute and taste in singing I was still much more surprised at the politeness of his manners the precision of his language and the ease with which he spoke You were not born said I to him in a cabin Pardon me replied he with a smile I  was  and even in this But you are fatigued I suppose George bring a chair Excuse me sir I owe my neighbours this nocturnal entertainment which I am now giving them  I would not take the chair but laid myself upon the grass as all the rest did Every body had by this time resumed his former posture and the silence which I had interrupted by appearing as I did among them now took place again  The youth began immediately to play upon his lute and in the intervals of playing sung a favourite ballad which he did with so much sweetness that a tear as I could see stood trembling in the eye of every one about  him by the time that he had repeated the first couplet I could not refrain from envying the surprizing genius of this rustic bard whoever he might be that could impress so powerfully an unlettered and almost an uncivilized society of people I was charmed in seeing how surprisingly those beauties that are drawn from nature please the souls of all men Of the poet's touches none were  and at the last which was the most  I heard round about me nothing but sighs and half stifled sobs  After some few minutes silence the whole company rose each wiping as I could see his eyes They wished each other a good night with perfect cordiality The neighbours with their children went away and none were left except an ancient man upon a seat beside the door and wh  m till now I had not noticed the musician with the woman sitting by him George the young boy whore name I recollected and myself  It was painful for me to give up the charming state in which at that time I was plunged I still continued fitting but got up at last and drawing near the young musician put my arms out as it were by instinct to embrace him Sweet it is said I to meet with people who surprize us at the first slight glance and finish by attracting our esteem before a quarter of an hour is passed He answered me no other way than by an ardent grasp of my hand while I was speaking Dear sir began the old man upon this you are pleased I perceive with our evening's entertainment I am glad you have conceived so suddenly a friendship for my dear Valentine for which you shall repose you in my bed No father interrapted George who came running from the barn I have been littering me some straw and the gentleman shall he in  my  bed if he pleases I was forced to promise that I would yield to this last offer George upon this held out his hand the old man rested on his shoulder and went in after wishing me a good night and now I found myself alone with Valentine and the young woman who he told me was his spouse I asked them if for my sake they would not pass fifteen minutes more in conversation with me where they then were as it was moonlight Willingly said Louisa who was not a little vain of  the attention that I had paid her husband Yes quite willingly replied Valentine who saw how much his wife desired it  I sat down between them with a linden tree behind me through whose foliage the moon darted all her brightness  My dear friends said I taking the woman by the hand pray let me know how long you have enjoyed your present happiness These six months answered she and now it is upwards of a twelvemonth that Valentine is happily returned among us from his travels You have travelled then said I with some surprise excited by this intimation Yes sir answered Valentine I have visited a part of EuropeEvery thing that I see about you interrupted I and every thing that I hear you say excites a deal of wonder in me if you have no secret motive for concealing the transactions of your life do not refuse me I beseech you the pleasure of hearing them Certainly you will not answered Louisa with great simplicity The gentleman seems a very civil kind of a person Besides I take much pleasure myself in listening to them  He consented with a smile to our request and the following narrative is delivered in his own words as far as my remembrance has preserved them  As I have mentioned I was born sir in this cottage towards the end of the year one thousand seven hundred and sixtyfour being at present threeandtwenty years of age I had the misfortune to lose my mother when an infant being hardly weaned My father was in easy though not in affluent circumstances but a lawsuit into which he was forced by one who is at present no more but was then a very wealthy farmer ruined him entirely and he died of grief when he was torn from his paternal cottage and beheld it sold for the advantage of the lawyers The old man whom you saw just now and who is become my father bought and came to settle in it He was struck with pity seeing me an orphan at my early time of life and though I was so little told me that I should be his shepherd I was treated very kindly by him and his children looked upon me as their brother Notwithstanding which the loss of my poor father the unkindness of my other kindred  who forsook me with the thought of being nothing but a stranger in the cottage where I first had my existence and the lonely life that I led upon the mountain all united to afflict me and my accustomed gaiety was changed to melancholy I consumed whole days in weeping while my flocks were grazing round me on the plain  Here Louisa withdrew her hand which I held in mine to wipe away a falling tear and then returned it me  One evening I was sitting on the summit of the mountain and amusing my afflicted thoughts by singing to myself the very ballad that you have just now heard Towards the conclusion I observed a man among the trees I noticed that he was dressed in brown his countenance was very pale he seemed quite melancholy and he waited till my song was finished He then came close to me and enquired how far he might be from the public road Oh very far dear sir said I above five miles Can you conduct me thither I would do so gladly but that I cannot quit my flock perhaps your parents may accommodate me with a lodging for the nightAh sir my parents are a great way offWhere thenThey lived like honest people upon earth and they are happy now in heaven  The tone of my voice as he informed me afterwards affected this good man and my reply he said could not but touch him He put several questions to me and my answers pleased him Night by this time being come I brought him to our cottage and my master entertained him hospitably On the morrow they had some discourse together with regard to me and when I was prepared to reassume my daily charge they told me that George would take it in future as the stranger meant to have me with him I would be useless were I to tell you what was my affliction at the thought of quitting this dear cottage though not mine and parting from my Louisa whom I loved even then though she was quite a child My situation was not any way a happy one and yet I could not quit it without shedding tears I could not possibly foresee that my future destination was to be decided by the present moment Yes to thee beneficent  protector of my youth I am a debtor for my present happiness Thou knowest generous man how ardently I prayed to God for thy prosperity while thou wert living and with what exhaustless gratitude I bless even still thy ashes He was called  Lafont  and had the place of organist in no great parish You would judge imperfectly of his abilities if you adverted to the nature and obscurity of his employment Many travellers turned out of their road to hear his music but their praises only made him the more modest I much doubt if in the course of your acquaintance you have ever met with such a genius He received from the affection of his father who when living was a very great physician such an education as would certainly have made  him  eminent as a physician likewise but he rather chose to yield himself entirely to the ardent passion that he had long before conceived for music He had married the daughter of the organist whom he succeeded but was childless His dear wife whom he had lost for several years still lived within his heart Her image and his books were now his only society in that deep melancholy which had seized upon his mind but still while he avoided men he did not hate them On the contrary he did much good in secret He was forty years of age when I came to him He instructed me at first to read and write and afterwards took pleasure in the cultivation of my voice and teaching me to play the lute which was his favourite instrument He did not stop at musical instruction he provided me selections from the works of our greatest poets He formed at once my heart my understanding and my taste Thus he acted for five years the part of an assiduous master without any expectation of reward for all his pains and labour but from him who best knows how to recompence the services that we do to our fellowcreatures  In the midst of all these occupations I had never banished from my mind the recollection of my cottage or the countenance of Louisa the partner of my childish pastimes I was often speaking of them to my patron and accordingly one dayI never shall forget it the first of June four years agohe rose betimes and going as his custom was to take a morning's walk bade me follow  him We talked of many matters while we went along as chance presented subjects for our conversation till at last he brought me to the very mountain where I saw him at first Dear Valentine said he I have fulfilled the duty which Providence I thought imposed upon me when first I saw you I am sensible how much you sigh when you reflect upon the habitation whence I took you and have had no other view in undertaking to protect and educate you than at last to put you in a way of getting possession of it once again I now shew it you look at it but take notice I forbid on pain of my displeasure your returning thither till such time as you have wherewithal to purchase it I give you my own lute I have instructed you to play upon it Travel you are not without a charming voice Wherever you are heard having no other pretensions than to the name of an itinerant musician you will be the first of artists in your way The novelty of the thing will never fail to bring you auditors and money only be discreet and frugal and when rich enough return into your own country and buy out your father's cottage  My heart beat high at this discourse and grew enlarged with hope and joy He held me to his bosom shedding tears They were the first that I ever yet had seen fall from him and they made a singular impression on me After this we thought of coming back and he conducted me in silence to his house  Upon the morrow at the break of day I was to leave my benefactor he bestowed on me at parting the instruction which he imagined I most needed together with two louis d'ors In four years time I travelled on foot through Italy all France and Germany equipped like what I was a peasant of the mountains with my hair as you may see at present floating in large curls upon my shoulders I took notice that the singularity of such a dress increased the effect proceeding from my music and particularly in the capitals Few noblemen I suppose ever travelled more agreeably than I did Every where I found a good reception and not only from the middling sort of people but the most polite The quality in cities made up concerts for no other purpose than to hear me and in villages I verily believe they married for the mirth of dancing to the music of my instrument In many  places I had advantageous offers made me to take up my residence among them They seduced me sometimes I acknowledge for an instant but as soon as I reflected again on my cottage every thought of fortune vanished nor of all my projects left one trace remaining I remember still what sweet sensations seized me every time when I went over a mountain in the  rse of my travels or even came in sight thereof I sought this hamlet on it and imagined for a moment that I could see my cottage With my mind continually full of such an idea I endeavoured to express my notions and these couplets were my composition  Sweet little cottage of my sire  Where when a child I play'd  To thee my longing sighs aspire  From distant realms convey'd  Each object lives within my mind  Which there the eye runs o'er  The hamlet and the hill behind  The linden tree before  Vast palaces and domes renown'd  I with indiff'rence see  My utmost wishes would be crown'd  Sweet rural cot in thee  When thy dear name I've heard or read  Whence sprung my joyunless  That Heav'n beneath thy peaceful shed  Hath fixt my happiness  My wand'rings o'er I'd smile at care  In thee sweet rural cot  Louisa too I trust would share  My calm and humble lot  Then come my Lute thy happiest strain  With willing strings pursue  My bliss if ev'ry wish I gain  To thee sweet Lute is due  Valentine sung these couplets with such sweetness and expression as revived in my mind the fabulous ideas of Apollo and methought I heard that exiled deity on earth and in the vales of Thessaly pouring forth his wishes to return to Olympus I desired to speak to cry out but found my tongue without motion Valentine could not but co  ive the meaning of my silence and went on as follows  I am now about to tell you by what means I came again into possession of this precious cottage  Towards December last when I had taken up my dwelling for a season at Turin and had been twice from one extremity of Italy to the other I examined the state of my purse and conceived myself then rich enough to pay a visit to my native mountain I immediately set out and after several forced journeys came in ten days time to the city where my benefactor had resided With what anxious expectation did I enter it and as I went along ask every one that I met what tidings he could give me of him But alas I was not to enjoy the pleasure of expressing what I owed him nor to behold him happy in the consequences of the friendship that he had shewn me He had been dead two months I went to pour out my tears on his tomb and made a vow to heaven that I would call my first child by his name if I ever should be so happy as to prove a father On the evening of that day I gained this hamlet Every one I found spoke favourably of me without knowing at first who I was My lute and the remembrance of our friendship soon obtained me Louisa's affection I received her from her father I bought back with his consent the cottage and the field belonging to it for two hundred crowns with which his eldest son procured a farm below us in the village and has been now some time settled in it With respect to himself he acquiesced to pass the remnant of his days with George his youngest son in our cottage It is from him that I learn the art of husbandry for now that I am once more in possession of my little patrimony the amount of my ambition is to be as was my father a good husband a kind parent and a virtuous peasant I have not as you may see forgot my lute the precious instrument which made my fortune but still keep it at my side  and often take it up for my own recreation or to please my family and neighbours  He stopped short at this but still I thought I heard him speaking My attention captivated by his narrative was turned insensibly upon his person after he had finished His ingenuous animated countenance the contrast of his dress and conversation his attachment to a rustic habitation and the gratitude with which he cherished the remembrance of his benefactor his uncommon fortune travels and profession every thing I thought exhibited the youth in some sort as a being of enchantment and superior to the ordinary race of men Louisa first roused me from my contemplation by her motion in the act of leaning forward to embrace him I complimented them on their happiness and they returned my civility with the most ingenuous expressions of friendship We went into the cottage where I was charmed to behold such an appearance of order and cleanliness about me After having made a plentiful but light repast upon such fruits as I was told the mountain yielded George led me to a closet which was rather narrow but the bed that filled it was both clean and wholesome Of this bed the little fellow told me he disposed with pleasure in my favour It was not long before I fell into a sound sleep during which my thoughts were occupied upon the grand objects that I had been contemplating in the evening and the agreeable sensations which had so recently impressed me I did not all the following day once quit this happy family when they were either busy at work or unemployed  Valentine related to me many entertaining matters that occurred to him in travelling and explained how he acquired that easiness of manners and politeness of expression that had charmed me at first and which afterwards as I discovered notwithstanding his great youth conciliated the respect and love of every aged individual through the hamlet The acuteness of his understanding the unstudied openness of Louisa the old man's blunt good sense the restless curiosity of George made their conversation interesting and diffused an undescribable variety through every part thereof which both charmed me and connected them much closer to each other I think I  could have passed my life away quite happy with them But why said I to myself why brood on such a contemplation I was to leave them that very night I confess I felt a pang of sadness to reflect upon our separation and imagined by their looks that it would occasion them some sorrow likewise If my fortune should in future permit me to dispose of the remainder of my life with more liberty I then intended and do still to make a yearly visit to this mountain for the purpose of seeing my friends again and filling my whole heart with those sensations of contentedness and peace which their society and habitation cannot but inspire  INTERESTED KINDNESS  Matthias Simon  Matthias  GOOD morning neighbour Simon I have half a dozen miles to go and should be glad if you would lend me Ball  Simon  I should be quite rejoiced friend Matthias to oblige you but I must set off myself immediately to fetch three sacks of meal home from the mill My wife wants some this very morning  Matthias  Then she must want it still for the mill I can inform you does not go today I heard the miller tell Tom Groves that the water was too low  Simon  You don't say so That is quite unlucky for in such case I must gallop up to London for the meal My wife would make a fine noise should I neglect it  Matthias  I can spare you the journey I have several sacks of meal at home of which I will lend your wife as much as she can want  Simon  Ah master Matthias I am sure your meal will never suit my wife You cannot conceive how whimsical she is  Matthias  If she were ten times more so I am certain she will like it as you sold it me yourself the best you assured me that ever you had  Simon  Yes yes that is true indeed I always have the best of every thing You know my good friend Matthias no one is more ready to oblige than I am but the mare refused this morning to eat straw and truly I am afraid she would not be able to carry you  Matthias  Oh never fear she shall not want for oats upon the road  Simon  Oats neighbour Oats are very dear  Matthias  They are so but no matter Having a good job in view one never stands for trifles  Simon  It will certainly be foggy and the road is pretty slippery If you should fall and break your neck  Matthias  What fear is there of that The mare is certainly surefooted and besides you talked yourself of galloping to London  Simon  Well then to speak the truth my saddle is all in pieces and I have sent my bridle likewise to be mended  Matthias  Luckily I have both a bridle and a saddle hanging up at home  Simon  Ah like enough But I am sure your saddle will not fit my mare  Matthias  Why then I will borrow Goodman Clodpole's  Simon  Clodpole's His will no more fit than yours does  Matthias  At the worst then there is our 'squire His stableboy is a friend of mine and he can lend me one to fit her or the deuce is in it out of twenty that his master has at the least  Simon  You know friend Matthias no one is more willing to oblige his neighbours than myself Believe me you should have the beast with all my heart but she has not been curried I believe these three weeks past Her mane is quite out of order and if any one should see her in this trim she would not fetch two guineas should I wish to sell her as perhaps I may  Matthias  Oh a horse is very quickly curried and my plowboy shall dispatch her in a quarter of an hour  Simon  Yes very likely but I have thought a little and now I recollect the creature must be shod  Matthias  Well is not there a smith here hard by  Simon  Oh yes such a bungler for my mare I would not trust him with my ass and none but Spavin the king's farrier in the Mews at London will suit me  Matthias  As luck will have it when I get to London I shall go quite near the Mews  Simon  seeing Francis his man calls out  Frank Frank  Francis  approaching  What want you master  Simon  Look here is neighbour Matthias and he wants the loan of Ball You know the skin last Monday was rubbed off her back a hand's breadth if not more  He tips Frank the wink  So go and see if she is well  Frank lets his master see that be understands him and goes out  I think she must be cured by this Oh yes so shake hands my good friend I am glad I shall be able to oblige you We must help each other in this life Had I flatly refused to let you have the mare you would perhaps in your turn have refused me something or another Yes that is plain The worst that can be said of Simon is that his acquaintance always find him ready when they want assistance  Francis now reenters  Well how fares it with poor Ball  Francis  How fares it with her master Bad enough indeed About a hand's breadth did you say You meant about the breadth of both my shoulders The poor creature cannot stir a step And then too I have promised her to Gossip Blaze to carry her to market  Simon  Do you hear that neighbour I am sorry that matters turn out thus I would not for the world have disobliged you but must not refuse the mare to goody Trust me I am very sorry for your sake dear Matthias  Matthias  And I as much for yours dear Simon for to tell the truth I had a note this morning from Lord Hazard's steward and he tells me that if I can but get to London time enough this very day he will let me have the first refusal of a deal of timber that my lord is minded to cut down It will be upwards of a hundred guineas profit to me out of which I meant to let you have from fifteen up to twenty as I intended that you should fell the trees But  Simon  What from fifteen up to twenty guineas did you say  Matthias  Ay truly did I and perhaps it might have been a great deal more But since your mare is out of order I will go see if I can get old Roan the blacksmith's horse  Simon  Old Roan My mare is at your service Here Frank Frank tell Gossip Blaze that she cannot have Ball today as neighbour Matthias wants her and surely I will not refuse my best friend any thing  Matthias  But what are you to do for meal  Simon  My wife can go without it for a fortnight  Matthias  And then your saddle that is all in pieces  Simon  I was speaking of the old one I have got another since and you shall have the first use of it  Matthias  So then you would have me leave the mare at Spavin's to be shod  Simon  No no I had forgot our neighbour shod her here last week by way of trial and to do him justice I must own he shoes extremely well  Matthias  But if the creature has lost so much skin from off her back as Francis says  Simon  Oh I know him He delights to make things worse a great deal than they are and I would lay any wager it is not bigger than my little finger  Matthias  Well then let him curry her a little as these three weeks past you know  Simon  These three weeks past I would not have him fail to curry her a single day  Matthias  At least however let him give her something that she will eat since she refuses straw  Simon  She did indeed this morning but the reason was that she had had a bellyfull of hay Don't be afraid of any thing She will skim along like any bird the road is very dry and we shall have no fog I wish you a good journey and a profitable job Come come this moment and I will hold the stirrup for you  THE SLOVEN  URBAN passed and very justly for an excellent boy He was extremely gentle always ready to oblige his little friends and never once displeased his parents or instructors  He had one great fault however he would lose his books with other matters and pay no attention to his clothes which were in common very dirty In one word he was a sloven  He had often been admonished of and punished for his negligence This punishment and admonition grieved him both on his own account and as he knew that his friends were sorry to proceed thus harshly with him He had many times resolved upon amendment but the habit was so strong that notwithstanding every resolution he had always the same slovenly appearance  His papa some time ago had promised him and his three brothers on the first fine day to take them out upon the water Such a day as he could wish now came there hardly was a capfull of wind and he remarked the water very smooth He therefore called the children told them his design and as he lived quite close beside the river went himself into the garden and picked out the neatest beat then plying  How rejoiced the little gentlemen appeared and how alert to make their preparation for a day of pleasure which they had been so long expecting  They were now all ready to set out when Mr Weston came to take them They jumped round about him in the transport of their joy and Mr Weston on his side was very happy to remark their satisfaction but what was his wonder when he saw Urban to observe the unseemliness of his apparel  Of his stockings one was as they say about his heels the other negligently gartered if at all in some sort made his leg look like a twisted column Two great holes were in his breeches knees his waistcoat was from top to bottom stained with grease or ink and there was wanting half a collar to his coat  The father saw with sorrow that it was impossible to take him in so slovenly a state as every one would have thought with reason that the father of so slovenly a child must be as negligent himself to suffer such a fault And seeing that Mr Weston was a man of merit and esteemed by those who knew him he was far from wishing such addition to his character  Urban had another coat but that unhappily was at the taylor's to be repaired and it was not a trifle that would repair it as it wanted one whole skirt which had been torn quite off The scowerer was to have it afterwards and work a day at least in getting out the dirt and spots  What was the consequence then my dear little friends There is not one of you but may easily guess  His brothers who had proper clothes to put on and whose general appearance did their father credit were admitted into the boat The body of it was painted blue as were the oars The gunnel and the edges of the oars were of a deep vermillion In the boat there was a linen awning that is roof supported at the corners to preserve the company beneath it from the sun the watermen had nice white linen shirts on three musicians had their station in the stern they were provided with a hautboy clarionet and violin and began to play a march in concert when the watermen first dipped their oars into the water upon which a crowd who were assembled at the stairs replied thereto with joyous shoutings  Poor Urban who had pleased himself a long time with the thoughts of such an airing was obliged to stay at home It is true he had the pleasure from a window of observing his papa and brothers go into the boat and of following it as far upon the river as his eye would let him while a gentle breeze swelled out the sails and made it seem to skim along upon the surface of the water and it is true his brothers after their return related all the pleasures that they had tasted in their day's excursion and of which the recollection made them still jump for joy  Another day as he was playing in a meadow with a little friend of his he chanced to lose a buckle but instead of seeking diligently for it he begged his comrade for a little while to lend him his because in walking to  and fro the straps which he trod on now and then had already more than once been like to trip him up  His little friend consented and Urban being quite intent on something and extremely anxious to renew his motion fastened it so negligently that in less than twenty minutes time he lost that also  They were both exceedingly embarrassed when the time was come for their returning home Night overtook them and the grass was so high that a lamb might easily have hid himself entirely in it How then could they find at dusk a thing so little They came home clumpetty clump each leaning on the other and quite sad particularly Urban who possessing real sensibility was grieved in having thus exposed his bosom friend and playmate to the anger of his parents  On the morrow he appeared before the family when they were assembled together with a single buckle for two shoes Sad sight for Mr Weston who perceived by that how much his exhortations were still thrown away  As oft as Monday came about he was accustomed to supply Urban and his brothers with a regular allowance that they might not be without the means of satisfying what are usually the wants of children but particularly any impulse to be generous Urban's brothers had constantly the pleasure of receiving this allowance while he poor fellow hardly ever had any of it on account of stoppages for buttons handkerchiefs and other things that he lost  A silver buckle costs some money but this was not the whole He had lost his companion's and was therefore obliged to pay for that likewise How was he to do it His allowance would not have enabled him to clear this debt in three months time  His father luckily had taught him even in his earliest infancy to use a pen and to employ the common phrase he wrote already an exceedingly fine hand  This therefore was the only occupation by which he could earn a little money and to his praise I must acknowledge he consented with a deal of willingness to an arrangement made on this occasion  His companion's father was an eminent attorney and employed above a dozen clerks to copy papers for him Mr Weston therefore offered him Urban's services in this  way 'till such time as he had earned enough to pay him for the buckle and requested that the attorney would consent to such a way of settling matters as it was very probable Urban might be greatly benefited by it  The attorney freely acquiesced and down Urban sat to work in copying law proceedings which at best were very tedious and in general scrawled over so that he could hardly read them whilst his brothers went a walking in the fields or entertained themselves by playing with each other in the garden  Oh how many sighs did his inattention cost him and how much pleasure did it occasion him to lose in a very few days  He had time for making many salutary comments on his conduct and resolving for the time to come upon a change In short he kept his resolution so that were I now to point him out dear little friends to any of you when you noticed the cleanliness of his person and the neatness of his general appearance you would find it difficult to think that he could be the same little boy whose history I have just now written for your instruction as well as amusement  THE FLOWER THAT NEVER FADES  Araminta Emily  Araminta  GOOD morrow dear Emily I consider it extremely kind that you are come to see me  Emily  My mama has just now given me leave to pass the evening with you  Araminta  Has she I am very glad of it It is such fine weather It appears to me as if our friends were much more welcome when all nature smiles about us  Emily  So I think too Give me your hand and let us walk How sweetly we shall pass the time in talking with each other  Araminta  Yes and running after one another Shall we fix upon the grove for our diversions  Emily  Oh with all my heart A special thought as we shall not be interrupted there  Araminta  I shall request you only to permit my sitting down a little so that I may give about a dozen stitches to this apron that I have brought with me  Emily  Do  and more than that I will help you  Araminta  Not for all the world Emily though I thank you but the truth is that I would not have a single stitch in what I am now making but my own  Emily  I judge then you design to make a present of it  Araminta  Right  Emily  And are you in a hurry to complete it  Araminta  I would not for a deal but that it should be finished by the th of this month which is Miss Le Févre's birthday  Emily  Miss Le Févre say you I do not recollect at pre  ent any one of that name among our acquaintances  Araminta  The reason is she is mine particularly one who is so good to me she seems to have no opportunity or rather time for being good to others Oh an excellent and tender friend to whom I am indebted very possibly for all my happiness  Emily  And how so pray dear Araminta I long to know her  Araminta  Well what think you of my governess  Emily  Oh she you know you call her generally Mademoiselle  Araminta  Yes Mademoiselle or Miss Le Févre Now pray have you not remarkedI do not mean when I came from France but nearly ten months since a wonderous change in my behaviour  Emily  To confess the truth I have and think you hardly the same person that you were formerly What can have caused so great an alteration Till you quitted England ay and unce you came from France I must acknowledge you were proud and huffish You offended every body without scruple and the least familiarity from others was considered as an insult by you but at present your behaviour is engaging You have that complacency and affability which cannot but win people's hearts I freely tell you I myself even love you ten times more at present than I did You took such airs upon you before  as disgusted me I was a hundred times disposed to break off all connection with you whereas now I find a real pleasure in your company and conversation And what pleases me still more than all is that you seem yourself much happier than before  Araminta  And so I am dear friend I was an object to be pitied at the time that you mention I occasioned all our family and every one that wished me well a deal of trouble Miss Le Févre in particular was grieved to think of my behaviour as she loved me tenderly and yet while I was grieving her I knew that she faithfully fulfilled the promise which she made to my dear mama upon her dyingbed of loving me with all the affection of a mother  Emily  Every body must confess you could not possibly have fallen into better hands and the advantage of your trip to France would have been really considerable had it only been the means of introducing such a person to you I am told there are few families but would wish to have her for their children  Araminta  You are yet to know how much I owe her therefore I design to tell you It is the story of a morning that will live for ever in my recollection it was the morning of the th of this very month and as I knew before her birthday I was awake betimes She must be still asleep said I for then we did not lie together no not even in the same apartment I will surprise her if I can before she rises so I dressed myself as nicely as I could then took the basket which a charming little lady you know who  she squeezes Emily by the hand  had given me as a present and ran down into the garden to get flowers that I might scatter them on Miss Le Févre's bed as is the custom upon birthdays in her country I stole secretly along the hedge and unperceived by any one had gathered three fresh roses I now looked about for honeysuckles jessamin and myrtle I bethought myself that they grew below the arbour at the bottom of the garden I was running thither but in passing by the arbour I saw Miss Le Févre on her knees within it and both hands before her face I turned to shun her but it was all in vain she heard my steps on which she raised her head perceived me and called out that I should come that moment to her  She had not as yet had time enough to wipe her eyes I saw that she had been crying but her tears were not like those which I had so often seen her shed at the recital of some just or generous action Noting her reception of me which was friendly and affectionate I could not but observe that she had a countenance of sorrow  With one hand she instantly took hold of mine and passed the other round my middle We walked up and down the terrace twice in this position and were silent for as Mademoiselle forbore to say a word I durst not move my lips so much was I affected by it  But at length she pressed me still more closely to her bosom and beholding me with tenderness and likewise glan  ing at my basket with the roses in it I observe said she dear Araminta you have lost no time to think upon my birthday This affectionate attention to me would certainly make me forget the melancholy thoughts which oppress my mind upon your account but that your happiness occasioned them Yes dearest Araminta attribute only to my friendship what I am now about to mention I am anxious to discharge my bosom of its load that I may welcome afterward those more delightful thoughts which I owe you for the present that I observe you were preparing for me  I was dumb and in a tremble while she thus addressed me it was as if my conscience had addressed me by her lips  You Araminta continued she who have received from nature such a disposition and have had that disposition so well cultivated by the example and instructions of your good mama will you pervert it by a fault which of itself alone must put out every virtue I will not mention it by name and now particularly after what I have already told you It might make you perhaps look with too much horror on yourself and I have no desire to mortify my lovely child It is sufficient that your heart acknowledges this fault and I persuade myself I know you well enough to be assured that your utmost efforts will in suture be excited to destroy it  Let us not go too fat back but only think of your behaviour yesterday  Do you remember the decisive tone of voice with which you spoke when at breakfast to display how much you knew of history You cited I must own events sufficiently instructive to have made the company attend to what you said but that they saw you resolved if I may say so to excite their admiration You appeared so marvellously well contented with yourself that they were really afraid of praising you which would have unavoidably inflamed or aggravated your selflove Remember likewise with how much attention they gave ear to little Arabella and were really enchanted with the grace of her recital and the modesty with which she blushed at being thought so well informed I saw you my dear turn pale with spite and envy Tears of rage were in your eyes and it was in vain that you strove to hide them while the company were inwardly rejoiced to see you so compleatly humbled  In the afternoon when with an air of triumph in your eyes you came to shew your writing and it passed without receiving any of those praises that you expected with what visible vexation did you receive it back when every one had seen it  And at night when you accompanied Miss Arabella on the harpsichord the bad time that you kept perhaps on purpose put her out and when she asked you in a whisper to play better what a hideous look did you then put on instead of doing as she bade you  Ah for heaven's sake interrupted I and at the same time burst out a crying Do not go on for you must know Emily her discourse had pierced me to the heart  It was vanity said I to Mademoiselle that vice which you durst not mention by its name I never saw its frightfulness so much believe me as at present  I could say no more but she was able to discern my thoughts Her arm in agitation pressed me once more to her bosom with a tenderness that I am unable to describe I felt her tears fall plenteously upon my cheeks while with her eyes she looked in silence up to heaven  The cloquence of this mute prayer compleatly overwhelmed me We were come without perceiving it to the foot of this large tree We stopped close by this green bank and I fell down upon it half swooning as it  were She instantly afforded me the tenderest succour and restored me to new life by her affectionate caresses  Being just upon the point of going in I said renewing my embraces dry your tears up my good friend they are the last that you shall have cause to shed on my account  On her part she embraced me still more tenderly and answered saying You could never have rejoiced me so compleatly on my birthday as by this noble resolution It is the fittest nosegay for us both the nosegay that I hope will never lose its beauty  By degrees we both became more tranquil She remarked the fineness of the morning and my heart now eased of an intolerable load was in a proper disposition to enjoy the beauty of the day which came on very fine  I grew sensible how sweet it is to have the experience of this calm within one's self I begged her to instruct me by what means I might keep up so pleasing a serenity Two hours thus passed away between us in a conversation full of friendship and affectionate instruction  My papa without informing me of his intention had prepared a little banquet we were present at it and gave signs with how much joy our bosoms overflowed Since then dear friend I have begun to put away that odious vice which made me insupportable to others and myself I leave you then to think if I can possibly omit on the return of such a day to testify my gratitude for such a worthy friend who was the means of making it the are of my happiness  Emily  My dearest Araminta since we have still a little time I will also prepare your friend a nosegay as a sign of gratitude for having heightened my enjoyment in continuing still to love you  Araminta  Come then now I have done and will assist you  THE MILITARY ACADEMY  A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  The MASTER  An ASSISTANT  EUGENIUS  the master's son  EDWARD  Scholars  RODERICK  Scholars  THEODORE  Scholars  The  SCENE  is in the Master's Study  SCENE I  The Master the Assistant  The Master sits writing before his desk  The Assistant  knocking at the door and half opening it  WILL you permit me sir to interrupt you for a moment  The Master  Come in sir without asking leave you know whatever time I have belongs of justice to the duties of my place  The Assistant  I wish to tell you of a circumstance not very common that has happened in the school within these few days past  The Master  What is it you alarm me  The Assistant  Oh there is no occasion sir for that what I have to say is rather affecting than alarming What are your ideas then of our last pupil Edward Barton  The Master  For these ten days past that he has been among us you are sensible I have not had an opportunity of even speaking to him This however I can say in his behalf that when his parents brought him I remarked something in his countenance that pleased me mightily Do any of the Assistants take offence at his behaviour  The Assistant  The reverse They give him all possible praise for his diligence and the greatness of his understanding also charms them He is come among us with more knowledge than our own scholars of three years standing generally have in short his schoolmates only and myself have reason to be discontented with him  The Master  How Sir have  you  reason to be discontented with him I am sorry for it  The Assistant  I am so indeed but much less on my own account than on his I do not know what it means but there must be some deep anxiety upon his mind I have had recourse to many methods for discovering it but have been always bafiled  The Master  What is his behaviour  The Assistant  In the first place sir he is very studious when in school and nothing can divert him from the business of it but in playtime he is silent and reserved among the scholars I have given him two who are allowed to be the sprightliest as companions and enjoined them to do every thing in their power to please him He is sensible indeed to their endeavours and acknowledges their kindness but when all is done their fire is utterly incapable of warming him and he appears between them just like so much ice  Yes  gentlemen  no  gentlemen and such like monosyllables are all his answers to their questions  The Master  He is sad no doubt at being separated from his parents  The Assistant  Yes it is very natural to think so yet his sadness has continued now ten days and can we think a child of only twelve years of age really susceptible of an impression for that length of time  The Master  Not often but a child of so much elevation as I thought his countenance indicated  The Assistant  Pardon sir my contradicting you for if that age is very lively it is variable also and since I have been a tutor here I have noticed that all those who have been most afflicted at the thought of being separated from their parents have and very shortly been induced by their companions to forget that separation Now whatever Edward's notions may be on this head what will you think when I have told you every thing  The Master  You raise my curiosity Proceed I look to be informed of nothing on the subject of this Edward but what is great and singular  The Assistant  Would you believe it then sir he refuses every thing at meal time but a little bread and water It is not possible that any criminal should be condemned to coarser fare than what he voluntarily chuses  The Master  You do not tell me so He should have lived at Sparta  The Assistant  True sir but with us where singularity must not be suffered and the little soldier is to be submissive to general subordination there is room to fear some danger to the rest in his example Twenty times would I have made him eat the victuals set before him but to all my instances he has no otherwise made answer than by turning towards me and in tearsI weep myself to think of his affecting way  The Master  I too am not unmoved This disobedience is however blameable and must not be unpunished If he should persist therein whatever causes it he cannot possibly stay here The intention of a military school is nothing less than that the scholars should be absolutely subject to the will of their instructors  The Assistant  His dismission was indeed the circumstance that I feared and therefore did I put off speaking of his disobedience to you I was every day in hope that his resolution would be conquered but it still continues  The Master  Is it possible that at his tender age he should be so far master of himself as to conceal his thoughts from one so exercised as you are in examining the dispositions of young people  The Assistant  He is what you called him just now a true Spartan His behaviour though not tinctured with a grain of pride is perfectly seducing Such is I may say his manner of concealing what afflicts him that one cannot but be really astonished at his silence and yet not harsh enough to think him obstinate  The Master  I will sound him then myself The light in which you place his portrait adds considerably to the fair opinion that I formed on my first seeing him If I can possibly prevail upon him to reveal the cause of his  affliction I persuade myself I shall be fully compensated for my trouble in obtaining it  The Assistant  On my part threats entreaties and persuasion have been all employed without effect Of course then I must fear your efforts will be no less unsuccessful though I wish the contrary and should be even happy if it proved so  The Master  In the first place I mean to question those whom you said you had enjoined to keep him company Who are they  The Assistant  Theodore and Roderick but your son Eugenius sir will give you better information  The Master  How has Edward interested  him  then  The Assistant  He thinks more I verity believe of Edward than himself I have observed him studying his actions silentlyThen he has never uttered a syllable to you about him  The Master  No but I am as well pleased with his reserve as his attention It proclaims a secret sympathy between him and the youth who has attracted him You will oblige me by conducting them all three together here this instant  The Assistant  I would rather send them as who knows sir but they will think my presence a restraint They will be free if I am absent  The Master  Right so let them come alone and send me Edward likewise when you find that they have lest me or on second thoughts let him sit down and wait my coming in the parlour I will be with him shortly  SCENE II  The Master alone  This affair is all a mystery to me It is very natural that Edward should grieve at being separated from his parents It is not possible but that a boy of such great hopes should be extremely dear to every one who knows him and have had continual marks of their indulgence but that nothing should have mitigated his affliction in the period of ten days surrounded by so many of his age and all no doubt desirous to amuse him and still more that he should wish for nothing in the world but bread  and water is inexplicable What the children have to eat is very good and therefore could not from its quality disgust him Besides he was never used at home to better fare His father at his bringing him to school informed me he was far from rich and had a numerous family to maintain The more I think of his behaviour still the more I think it wonderful  He walks about a little while in thought  SCENE III  The Master Eugenius Roderick Theodore  Eugenius  We come papa according to your order The assistant told us that we were wanted Theodore and Roderick and myself  The Master  Yes Eugenius I desire to have a little conversation with these two young gentlemen and you  Roderick and Theodore  It is doing us a deal of honour  Eugenius  Yes and pleasure too at least  I  think so  The Master  to Theodore and Roderick  I am told you are not quite contented with your new companion's conduct  Roderick  To confess the truth sir he is indeed a little of the dullest this same masterWhat is his name  Theodore  He has spoke so little to us we do not recollect what name he goes by  Eugenius  Edward Barton For his name I do not think much of that in preference to any other but his person that is another thing and I am happy to be acquainted with him  Roderick  Edwarda good name enough if  Dummy  were but added Master Edward Dummy  Eugenius  O papa pray do not let Roderick ridicule poor Edward in this manner  The Master  Master Roderick who has authorized you to distribute epithets among your schoolmates thus  Roderick  Because he does not speak three words in half an hour Had he come to us from the moon I should not wonder at it He is so pale and mopish he would not belie his country  The Master  Should his paleness then or mopishness as you are pleased to call it make you hate him  Roderick  I am not his enemy far from it sir but cannot be his friend since he does nothing to divert us after we have taken so much pains to make him speak  Theodore  The night sir is surely long enough for silence The day was made for amusement laughing and talking  Roderick  Must  I  be dull because  be  takes so much delight in dulness  Eugenius  Poor young man You should not call it dulness it is uneasiness  Roderick  And did we not do every thing in our power to make him chearful But the more we play our monkey tricks to make him fall a grinning still the more his sober sadness gains upon him We have done with him at last at our diversions but still find him when we come to  inner where he makes such faces as are enough to make us hungry again  The Master  Has he any sickening method as some children have of eating  Roderick  He must needs be very aukward were his manners sickening since he eats bread only and drinks nothing but clear water  Theodore  He affects a puny stomach merely to shew us what good things he had at home  Eugenius  You very much mistake him if you fancy that it is from pride I watched him yesterday when he had good roast beef put down before him and could see though he concealed his face that his eyes were full of tears  The Master  You don't say so Eugenius  Roderick  Yes indeed he very often whimpers and if once Don Quixote should return again to life they would fight to know which of them should be called  Knight of the Weeful Visage  The Master  Are you so unfeeling as to make a joke of his affliction  Roderick  He is enough to make us also of Don Quixote's order It is quite dismal to see such a countenance at dinner it deprives us of our stomachs Look ye commend me to Theodore he would give you a good appetite to see him eat  The Master  You would be glad then I suppose to rid yourselves of Edward at your table  Roderick  Yes sir and with all our hearts unless he would become a little merry  Eugenius  Well then let him sit papa at mine I should be glad to have him by me and will take care of him  The Master  You are not afraid then of his sadness like these gentlemen  Eugenius  I am doubtless sorrowful to see him sad but merely upon that account would shew him all the friendship in my power He would not perhaps be so unhappy did he know that we pity him  The Master  Can neither of you guess the reason of his melancholy  Theodore  To confess the truth I never thought of asking him  Roderick  Why wish to know things that are sure to make one sad  The Master  And you Eugenius can you let me have no better information  Eugenius  No indeed papa I should have been rejoiced to know the secret and to console him were it in my power These three times have I begged him to reveal it but durst go no further when I saw he was resolved to keep it Doubtless he does not think me yet sufficiently his friend to trust me with it I must therefore merit his reliance on me by my services  The Master  But why Eugenius tell me nothing of all this before  Eugenius  Because I thought that you would have forced him to conduct himself upon a footing with the rest and have reprimanded him in case of his refusal You have given me your permission to be always in the school and I shall never be so mean as to betray my dear companions by telling tales But if ever they do any thing that merits commendation never fear but I will come and make you acquainted with it  The Master  embracing Eugenius  I expected nothing less my dear Eugenius from your sensibility and am quite charmed to find myself not disappointed  To Theodore and Roderick  I am sorry gentlemen that I cannot bestow the same eulogium on your conduct I could certainly have wished that you had evinced a little affection or at least some slight consideration for poor Edward  in his sorrow Go return to your amusements it were a pity to disturb you in them If your turn of mind preserves you from some sort of sorrows I am grievously afraid that it hinders you from relishing those exquisite delights which a generous heart experiences  Theodore and Roacrick leave the room in manifest confusion  SCENE IV  The Master Eugenius  The Master  It is you only that are worthy to enjoy those exquisite delights How I rejoice to find you so compassionate towards others in their sorrow  Eugenius  Who papa could possibly refrain from pitying the unhappy Edward His dejection and his paleness every thing announces some uncommon cause of sorrow in his heart So young and yet so miserable I avoided him at first just like the rest and thought him morose and savage But when I afterwards noticed his consistency and perseverance his condescension and politeness I was gradually attracted by him so as in the end to give him all my friendship and I think I should conceive a great deal better of myself could I but merit his  The Master  You know however that he has behaved so as to incur the crime of disobedience  Eugenius  Yes at tableI cannot possibly conceive the meaning of it but perhaps he fancies that every soldier should live course  After all his singular abstemiousness is better than the gluttony of others and the example that he  olds out can injure no one Pray then let him still continue what is so much to his liking being as he is so punctual to h  duty and so diligent in school He is the first or all his class in mathematics geography and drawing  The Master  But a conduct which so openly infringes upon rule and order cannot be excused in any circumstance nor from any motive I perceive I shall be forced to send him home  Eugenius  You do not mean so papa What for so slight a fault and one that perhaps merits praise rather  than censure will you send him off as if his principles were vicious Let  me  go then with him likewise  The Master  How Eugenius are you so attached to him then For what reason  Eugenius  I cannot tell you yet if you will but have a little conversation with him you will perhaps discern the reason How rejoiced I should be were he but my brother I should only have this to fear that you would love him more than you do me at present  The Master  I have sent for him and mean to have some conversation with him here I shall then discern if he is worthy of inspiring such a strong attachment and sincerely hope that you have not misjudged in the affair If so I promisebut of that another time I hear somebody knock Step into the adjoining room that if I call you may come to us  Eugenius  Yes papa  Eugenius goes out The Master rises to open the door  SCENE V  Edward entering bows respectfully to the Master who sits down Edward stands before him  The Master  Well master Barton can you any way conjecture why I sent to fetch you  Edward  Yes sir I am afraid I guess the reason  The Master  Is it true then that you disdain the company and conversation of your schoolmates and disturb their pastimes by such whims and affectations as were never heard of in a person of your age  Edward  I dare answer sir with all the deference and respect that I owe you it was never my intention to do either  The Master  You have been told for instance what rules the scholars are to observe when at meals and yet you choose to live on bread and water  Edward  True sir I want nothing more  The Master  The Assistant has endeavoured to convince you how improper such a singularity must be considered and yet finds you fixed to persevere therein  Edward  Yes sir  The Master  And think you such a perseverance commendable  Edward  Not sir in your thoughts I own  The Master  It is then a matter of indifference to you whether you do right or wrong in my opinion  Edward  No sir for in that case I should heed as little your repreaches as your praise I know what obligation I am under to obey you and have often blamed myself for not complying with your pleasure in the regulations of this place but still have found it utterly impossible to do so Heaven is notwithstanding witness for me that I am not quite so guilty as appearances proclaim me  The Master  I will readily allow you are yourself persuaded of your innocence and therefore think that you have such reasons as will jestify your disobedienceHave you any thing to say then  Edward  Nothing sir  The Master  But surely you must know that disobedience is a bad example even though you think that your motives will excuse you  Edward  I have had the honour to acknowledge that myself  The Master  That hitherto it has been tolerated from the hope of your amendment  Edward  Never  The Master  And in short that by your obstinacy you have merited already the severest punishment  Edward  I am ready to endure it  The Master  But not ready to amend your conduct  Edward  It is impossible  The Master  I see then and am sorry for it that it will be impossible for me to keep you here a moment longer as it would be contrary to all good to suffer such an instance of rebellion in an Institution of this sort  Edward  What will become of me at that rate wretched as I am O sir must I then be at last a burthen to my parents and an object of contempt for others Have I merited this sentence  The Master  Have you merited this sentence When you will not place the least degree of confidence in me do you ask that question Would you hide a secret from  your father I am here to be a father to you and you will not shew yourself a son to me  Edward  If such sir be your condescension I will give you the possession of my heart I could stand patiently and hear your threats but cannot be unaffected by your friendship yes sir I will lay out my whole heart before you and make known the affliction that oppresses me  The Master  You are willing then to think yourself my son  Edward  throwing himself into the Master's arms  Are you then willing to become my second father  The Master  embracing him  O my dearest Edward call me for the future only by that name  Edward  Well then my second father I have one at home so poor that he subsists on scarcely better food than bread and water My poor mother likewise is as much reduced as he is I have two sisters and as many brothers who enjoy no better fare And can I then indulge my appetite and live on your good things while they have as it were no more than bread to moisten with their tears No no much rather would I die of hunger I am Edward Barton and there never was a father of that name who had a son unworthy of him  The Master  What has no one then solicited the government in favour of so old a soldier  Edward  No one sir but he is destitute of all things after having served his country two and twenty years with honour and consumed the little that he had left him in soliciting a pension On the eve of my departure for this place I heard him read the story of Count Ugolino who was shut up in a castle with his family to die of hunger Since that moment this sad story has been always in my mind I think that I hear incessantly the parish bells a tolling for the burial of my father mother brothers and poor sisters Can I then make merry when my heart is overflowed with tears and eat such food as my afflicted parents cannot purchase If I could I should no longer be Edward Barton While my father is unhappy in whatever corner of the earth I may be nothing shall prevent me from enduring his affliction If the king  The Master  The king for certain knows not of your father's situation if he did he would have softened it I will use my interest to convey the knowledge of it to him and do you rely upon his justice My dear Edward why not tell me this before You might perhaps have spared your family ten days distress at least  Edward  You think then sir that I shall become so happy as to save him at my years  The Master  I hope so and at least am certain that your behaviour has  relieved  him Generous child Why are you not indeed my son  Edward  My love and gratitude consider you my father It is a debt that I owe to your generosity for wishing thus I were your son  The Master  looking at him with affection  My dear son Edward  Edward  Yes I am and will be so You are the father too of all my family if through your friendship they may be assisted but alas sir we have been so long unhappy it is not to be hoped  The Master  Hoped Edward Should you doubt of what I tell you it would be an insult to me I have told you that I was certain your behaviour had relieved your parents since relief depends upon myself alone and therefore  going to his bureau end giving him a paper  'till I have tried the effect of my interest which is not inconsiderable take this it is a twenty pound bank note and what your father gives you as the first fruit of his love  Edward  interrupting him  Give  me  what need can  I  have for it Send oh send your generous present to my father there it will be useful  The Master  He shall know that he is indebted for it to your filial piety and now therefore my dear Edward you will no longer live on bread and water  Edward  Not till my poor father is reduced again to do so  The Master  And in future you will be joyous with your comrades  Edward  While my father is joyous with his wife and children  The Master  Well then run and write your father an account of this transaction I will go dress myself and  instantly set off for London I shall see a nobleman of considerable interest this very morning  Edward  How shall I collect my spirits to return you thanks in such a manner as I ought sir  The Master  smiling  SirIt seems then you forget already that you are my son  Edward  falling at his master's feet  O father O my dear dear father pardon me if being as I am beside myself  The Master  raising Edward and conducting him affectionately towards the door  Go go my child and leave me here a little I have no less occasion to compose myself than you  Edward  I will come back very shortly with my letter You must see it so do not go dear father till I have once again embraced you  The Master  No my dearest son I will not deny myself that pleasure Run and write your letter I will wait for you  SCENE VI  The Master  alone  Fortunate occurrence Oh happy day What a number of affecting objects all at once present themselves before me A brave soldier for whose services I am about to procure a recompence and his son whom I may form into a man and so contribute to the glory of my country My Eugenius who appears so sensible of the impression made by virtue on his heart and so worthy of the friend whom he has selected thus My sovereign to whose notice I shall introduce a little hero such as his munificence may cherish and a suffering wife and children such as his compassion may deliver from affliction  SCENE VII  The Master the Assistant  The Master  You are come sir quite a propos to share my transports  The Assistant  What has caused them my good sir You are no less agitated than young Edward who ran by me wild as one might think with pleasure for he did not see me did not seem as if he trod upon the ground His eyes as I looked at him beamed with rapture though the tears that he had been shedding were not quite dried up I called out to him but he could not hear me  The Master  It would have charmed you had you witnessed what has passed between us It was a moment such as does not twice occur in any one man's life  The Assistant  Your hope then is not disappointed You have wrought upon him to reveal the cause of his affliction  The Master  But what difficulty had I to obtain my wish what pain  t gave me to upbraid him and how nobly he withstood me How much honour does even his disobedience reflect upon him  The Assistant  I foresaw as much in general though I could not clear up the particulars to reason on them  The Master  Who could possibly have guessed at the excess of his affection he was prompted to deny his appetite at table that he might not fare in the least degree better than his parents At so great a distance from them he supported such privations though he knew that by doing so he could not succour them What think you of so rare a youth What think you of a father who surrounded by misfortunes has been able thus to form his son to virtue What exalted pleasure for a monarch to reward such virtue I am proud my friend that I have it in my power to convey to his royal ear intelligence of this poor youth and his afflicted father's sufferings and deserts There is but one thing else that would yield me greater satisfaction I should like to be in such a situation as to give him an account of all his meritorious subjects I would so exalt his throne that he should then be able to look down on every virtuous man in his dominions while these last by looking up should see him in the action of applauding and encouraging their virtue Thus without the wretched breath of adulation might a king be really among his subjects called their god  The Assistant  Our king is worthy your solicitude to interest him in behalf of Edward and his parents  The Master  That is what I told him I would do and how great was his gratitude We called each other son and father and I verily believe experienced the affection in our hearts of such affinity But do not I hear somebody coming I believe it is he Step therefore into this apartment you will find Eugenius there I shall soon require your presence here again if it be Edward  The Assistant withdraws when Edward comes in sight  The Master  alone  Yes it is he and how affectingly expressive even at this distance is his whole countenance  SCENE VIII  The Master Edward  Edward  rushing to embrace his master  Father dear dear father here is my letter  The Master  It is not sealed as I observe and therefore you would have me read it  Edward  Would It is every line about you  The Master  reading  "Papa mama brothers and sisters Come all of you together while this letter is reading Oh that I were present and could read it you myself but I  am  present and observe you Weep no longer as I trust you are no longer to subsist on bread and tears There are on earth here generous bosoms as in heaven of whom the master of our Academy as I have found is one He is my father let me call him so or rather the protecting angel of our family Would you believe it he has sent you this as from himself and will solicit you a pension which he says he doubts not of obtaining for you Fall upon your knees and bless him as I do  The master stops and seeing Edward on his knees with hands and eyes toward heaven affectionately raises him and says  What means this my son  Edward  I am offering you my life It is at your disposal  The Master  No my dearest Edward keep it for the accomplishment of worthy and illustrious actions Mine is posting fast to its decay but by your conduct you may lengthen it  Edward  eagerly  I father Shall I ever be so happy Speak Oh speak sir and inform me by what means I may experience so much heartfelt satisfaction  The Master  By your friendship for my son  He opens the adjoining chamber door  Eugenius enter and embrace your brother  SCENE IX  The Master Edward the Assistant Eugenius Edward and Eugenius rush into each other's arms  The Master  Edward he is worthy of your friendship his affection for you went before his father's  Edward  I could clearly see indeed that my sufferings moved him  Eugenius  You shall never suffer for the future but myself will be a sharer with you Shall I not dear Edward  Edward  taking Eugenius by the hand and presenting it with his own to the Master  Well then my Eugenius let us thus connect ourselves as friends for ever in the hands of our respectable and common father  The Master  Yes dear children I approve your wishes and bestow my blessing on them Let those happy days return as far as your example can have influence when the field of combat was a theatre for friendship When warriors united the most amiable private qualities to the most undaunted courage Let Sidney and Wolfe be your model serve your Sovereign with sidelity like theirs Live as they did admired by all mankind and if necessary die as they did regretted in the service of your country  PHILIP  OH I'll be revenged and make him heartily repent it cried little Philip while his countenance turned quite red with anger and he walked along not seeing Emilius his dear friend who at that instant happened to be coming towards him and hearing what he said with some degree of pain asked him of whom he meant to be revenged Philip lifted up his eyes he saw his friend and reassumed the smile with which his countenance was generally glowing Ah said he come my friend and you shall see of whom I will be revenged You remember I believe my little  supple Jack  that pretty cane my father gave me see it is all in pieces the farmer's son that lives at yonder thatched cottage has broke it And pray why did he break it said Emilius I was walking peaceably along said Philip with the greatest agitation and was playing with my cane by putting it quite round my body one of the two ends by some means or another got out of my hand when I was opposite the gate just by the wooden bridge and where the little blackguard had put down a pitcher full of water which he was carrying home from the well My cane in springing struck the pitcher overset but did not break it He came up close to me and began to call me names I seriously assured him that I had not intended to do what I did and was extremely sorry for the accident He would not hear me but got hold that moment of my  supple Jack  and twisted it as you may see I will make him however heartily repent it I shall sind a way to be revenged of him  He is indeed a very illnatured boy said Emilius but is already punished very well for being so since every one detests and shuns him If he wishes to enjoy a little play he never can have a companion if he comes where any boys are met to play they always thrust him out but if he will not quit them they leave him The hatred of all that know him cannot but sufficiently avenge you  Yes but he has broke my cane said Philip My papa gave it me but very lately and it was a very pretty one as you know My father will not fail to ask me what is become of it he will imagine that I have lost his present  possibly he will fall into a passion and all on account of this little blackguard I did him no harm I offered to fill up his pitcher having knocked it down without designThe illnatured our I will be revenged of him  Believe me my dear friend said Emilius it will be better not to mind him Your contempt is punishment enough for such a one You are not like him and depend up  n it he will shew himself at all times abler to do mischief th  n yourself And now I think upon it I must tell you what but very lately happened to him  Unluckily for him he saw a bee upon a flower he tri  d to catch it and pull off its wings for pastime  but the bee contrived to sting him and flew off in safety to the hive Quite mad with rage he said as you did I will be revenged for this Accordingly he cut himself a switch thrust it through the hole into the beehive and turned it about By these means he killed several of the little creatures but in an instant the whole swarm flew all at once upon and stung him in a thousand different places You may guess how he roared with the pain and how in his agony be tumbled himself about upon the ground His father ran up to him and could not without much difficulty put the bees to flight by flinging bowls of water on him He was ill in consequence of this for several days  You see then his vengeance had no very great success  not therefore his insults he will meet with some  who will panish him without your taking any  in the matter And besides as he is illnatured would you be so likewise for my friend he is much stronger than you are and to be sure of your revenge you must be much more malicious than he is  I think said Philip you are in the right so come along with me I will tell my father every thing and he will not be angry with me I hope for look you I can easily take comfort for my broken cane but not should he imagine that I neglected to take care of what he  gave me After this they went together Philip told his father what had happened The good gentleman consoled his son and thanked little Emilius for the advice that he had given him  On the day succeeding Philip had another cane exactly like the first He passed the farmer's house his son was at the door and hung his head while Philip went along  However Philip some days after saw this little peasant fall under a heavy log of wood that he was carrying home and which prevented him from getting up again Philip ran up to him took the log from off his shoulder helped him to rise and take his load once more upon his shoulders The illnatured boy was now quite overwhelmed with shame at the idea of receiving aid from him whom he had served so ill and heartily repented his behaviour Philip afterwards went home quite satisfied At first he had assisted one whom he did not love because he could not see a fellowcreature suffer without relleving him but afterwards he was rejoiced to think of his behaviour "This said Philip is the noblest vengeance It is impossible I should repent thereof"  CHARLOTTE  BEFORE the house in which Charlotte's parents lived you must know there was a little opening ornamented with a grass plat and quite overshaded with a noble tree from whence the eye could plainly see whatever passed along the public road Miss Charlotte frequently would come beneath this umbrage with her little chair and in her hand the stocking that she was making for her dear mama who had instructed her to knit One day as she was sitting there she saw a poor old man advancing very slowly towards her on the road his hair was of a silver white his back was b  nt with age he rested on a stick and seemed to walk in pain Poor man said Charlottle looking at him he  seems very much in pain and perhaps is poor besides If so then he is doubly miserable  Further on she saw a company of boys together who came after the old man They very quickly reached him They remarked his threadbare coat which was exceedingly long skirted and had sleeves a deal too short His hat quite rusty did not escape their notice as the flaps hung down upon his shoulders he had hollow cheeks and seeing him they all burst out a laughing As it chanced there lay a stone upon the ground before him which he stumbled over and was almost down this set them once again a laughing while the poor old man for his part sighed  I once was young as you are said he to the boys and did not laugh at the infirmities of such as I am now You will in time be old yourselves and every day you are approaching towards my time of life You will then be sensible of the injustice of your ridicule So saying he went on again but made a second stumble and in struggling to preserve himself from falling dropped his lick At this the boys renewed their laugh a third time crying let us see now how he will lift it up again  Miss Charlotte who had heard the old man speak and was touched with pity for him saw his situation put her stocking down upon the chair ran towards him took up his stick put it back into his hand and taking hold of his other arm as if she had been very strong exhorted him to lean upon her and not notice any thing that the boys might say The poor old man looked at her "Lovely child" said he "how good you are I am at once consoled for all the ridicule with which they treat me May you be for ever happy" and so saying they walked on together but the boys no longer followed him as they had done before perhaps they were ashamed of their proceeding  Some few moments after one of them fell down himself and all the rest burst out a laughing as they had done before for his part he was very angry and when up again ran after his companions pelting them with stones He was convinced then how unjust it is to laugh at any one's distress he formed a resolution never for the time to come to laugh at any old man's pain and followed  at a distance him whom he had before made the object of laughter hoping to have the opportunity of making some atonement for his fault  In the mean time the good old man assisted by the friendly aid of Charlotte went on with flow but yet sure steps She offered him the opportunity of stopping to repose himself a little Do you see our house said she Pray stay and sit a little under that large tree my parents are neither of them at home you will on that account be not so well entertained yet still you will enjoy a little rest The poor old man accepted Charlotte's offer Charlotte brought him out a chair and then to hearten up his spirits let him have some good small beer and bread and cheese The child had nothing else to give  Her guest could not refrain from thanking her continually "Your parents are still alive" said he "They love you you love them They cannot therefore but be very happy may they always be so""And you good old man" said Charlotte "have you no children" "I had once a son" said he "who was settled in London he loved me affectionately and often came to see me but alas he is now dead and I am left without the least degree of consolation Indeed his widow is rich she takes the lady on her and imagines it not worth her while to know if I am dead or living as she wishes to forget that her husband's father is a peasant I do not even know her children which in truth are mine"He was so much affected while he spoke these words that tears rolled down his withered cheeks  The gentle Charlotte likewise was affected and cried out Can any one be so cruel Ah my mother my dear mother would not act so wickedly On this she spoke of other matters that she might not grieve him when he arose and thanked Charlotte with a blessing but she would not leave him so she meant to go a little way still farther with him  On the way they saw the little boy who had been following them for he had run a great way on before and now was sitting on the grass He cast  is eyes down when they looked upon him rose up after they had passed and followed them again The  itt  e girl observed him but would not speak of him She asked the old man if he lived alone No little lady answered he I have a cottage  see there it is beside you tree across the meadow You observe it is no great distance off it is in the middle of a little garden I have an orchard and a field likewise and I told a poor old neighbour who some years since left his cottage which fell down through age that if he would but come and live with me he should in future cultivate my ground I told him that I would live with him that he should enjoy whatever I might have and I would only ask him to provide me necessaries He agreed He never had a child he is extremely good and honest and for my part I am quite at ease in his society And yet in spite of all his diligence at times I think myself deserted I no longer see my son and I was constantly accustomed to receive from him the tenderest tokens of affection In the very place where I have seen him run to meet me I am now assisted only by the hand of strangers I no longer see his children who have utterly forgot me I shall live far distant from them I shall die and very likely never see them moreAlas if their poor father were but still livingHe could not utter one word more  The gentle Charlotte touched with these complaints said to him I will come and see you with my mother we will frequently be with you But her kindness only served to aggravate his grief The sensibility and kindness of the little girl made him recollect of how much consc  ation he was utterly deprived and in returning her his thanks the tears which he could not help shedding hindered him from seeing where he walked  He took his handkerchief to wipe his eyes and troubled by sad thoughts instead of putting it again into his pocket let it drop upon the ground without perceiving what he did nor did his young companion notice it The boy however who was following them observed the whole transaction picked it up and ran to give it him "Here good old man" said he "you dropped your han  kerchief it was on the ground"  Thank you thank you heartily my little friend answered the old man God's providence be praised for all things Here is an honest little gentleman who does not ricicule old age and laugh at the afflictions that attend it Oh no no you do not look with scorn upon a poor old man I see it in your eyes You are not of the number  of those wicked little fellows whom you must certainly have passed although you were not with them Charlotte recollected having seen the little boy among them and remarked his laughing just as they did but she would not say a word about it for although she did not at all approve the boy's behaviour yet her good nature would not suffer her to give him pain by telling what she knew  The little culprit in the mean time held down his head and thought of lying more than once but he had not been used to such a crime His heart besides was not so wicked that he needed to conceal the truth lest people should despise him "Pardon me" said he "I was among them and insulted you as they did but am now very sorry for it I have found out some time past that when I mix with children of my age or thereabouts I am more mischievous than when alone Had I been by myself I should never have laughed at your stumbling but on the contrary my first desire would certainly have been to help you I should be very happy to assist you now if I could in order to make amends for my offence"  "You have already done so my good little friend" said he You have a deal of candour and goodnature and will certainly become an honest man I dare believe as much Come therefore both of you to my abode It is just before us but a few steps more and we shall be there I will let you have some milk and we will drink together"At this invitation of the good old man our little boy was very happy Charlotte would have wished to decline it but did not from a fear of grieving him They reached the habitation he brought out some milk two porringers and a loaf of bread a little coarse it must be owned but very good They all sat down upon the grass and made a comfortable meal "What pleasure you both give me" said the good old man "Yes truly I am very much delighted upon this occasion I have found out two good little friends who neither scorn the poor man nor the infirm My  eep at night will be the sweeter for it"  Both the boy and girl as they sat beside him testified their joy and gratitude but yet their looks were more expressive than their words However they began to  think of going Charlotte feared lest her parents might come home and be uneasy at her absence and the little man expressed how he was grieved so soon to quit him but his mother he feared would scold him should he think of staying longer  "She must then be very cross this mother that you dread so much" said the poor old man"Not always" said the little boy "However she is sometimes so and though she loves me yet I fear her greatly""And your father""Oh I scarce knew him he has been dead these four years""Dead these four years" interrupted the old man and fixed his eyes upon the child "Should it be heI have s  me recollection of his features Should it be little Francis""Yes Francis is my name"  The old man stood for some few moments motionless and with an altered voice his eye brim full of tears and with extended arms cried out to Francis "My dear child you do not recollect your grandfatherEmbrace meYou have the very features of my son My dearest child you no longer thought of me"Francis tenderly caressed him but endeavoured all in vain to speak Little Charlotte too shed tears of joy to see the old man comforted  "You see him" said the good man "you see him" He is in reality the living picture of his father Yes he is my sonMy son affectionately loved me and his son will love me too I shall not be so wretched as I feared in my old age nor will the evening of my life be passed without some joy I shall depart in peace But I forget that by detaining you I may subject you to your mother's anger I was so much pleased that I forgot that circumstance Depart then my dear boy I do not wish that my joy should cost you tears Depart and love your mother be obedient to her even though you should not come and see me It will be very hard however should you quit me now for ever Come and see me if you can provided you do not disobey or tell a story to obtain permission"  Turning then to Charlotte "And for you dear little maid" said he "I am convinced you ought to leave me as your parents would be certainly uneasy should you stay too long I owe you all my joy and shall for ever  bless you Come at times and see me Do not I beseech you my dear children utterly forget me May you both be happy"  At these words the children went away affectionately holding one another by the hand They did not speak but every now and then they looked behind them while the old man on his side continued looking constantly at them and did not turn to go into his cottage until they were out of sight Little Charlotte got home safe Her parents were not yet returned however they came home very soon after her She told them where she had been and what she had done It was the subject of their evening's conversation  On the morrow they all went to see the good old man and in the sequel frequently repeated their kind visit Francis likewise came to see his grandfather who was rejoiced to see him to hear him speak and to receive the most affectionate caresses from him while for his part Francis was as much rejoiced excepting when he did not see his Charlotte he was then quite sorrowful and went home sad The more he grew towards manhood still the more he loved her and accordingly when he was old enough to take a wife he would espouse no other woman though she was not rich The old man lived to see them married blessed them and soon after died in peace  THE WATCH  YOUNG Clara at her return from a visit which she had just before been paying to an intimate acquaintance appeared quite pensive and sad She found her sisters entertaining one another with that innocent and lively joy which heaven seems delighted to infuse into the sports of infancy Instead of making one among them with her usual playfulness she moved to a corner of the  oom sat there as if it vexed her to behold their gaiety and when the little ones began to prattle in hopes that she would join in their diversion replied peevishly to what they asked her When the father who loved Clara exceedingly  beheld her thus dejected which was but very seldom the case he began to be uneasy put her on his knee and taking her affectionately by the hand enquired what ailed his little child that she appeared so melancholy "Nothing nothing" answered Clara at first to all his questions but at length on being pressed more earnestly to tell him every thing she replied that all the little ladies whom she had seen that evening at her friend's where she had been a visiting had each received a very pretty present from their parents or else friends by way of fairing though not one among them was so far advanced in learning as herself She mentioned more particularly one Miss Richmond whose uncle had that very morning purchased her a very fine gold watch "Oh what pleasure" added she "Miss Richmond must feel in having such a handsome watch beside her"  "This then is the cause of your uneasiness I find" said Mr Ford with a smile "Thank heaven it is not so bad as I imagined I supposed that you might have met with some unhappy accident And what would you do then my dear sweet Clara with a watch  Clara  What others do papa I would have it fastened to my girdle and look at it every moment of the day that I might know what time it was  Mr Ford  What every moment Clara Your moments then are very precious or perhaps your hours of needlework and study hang too heavy on you  Clara  No papa for you have often told me that I am at present in the happiest season of my life  Mr Ford  Well then my child if you have no occasion for a watch but to know the hour we have a clock here at the staircase foot and that will always tell you  Clara  Yes papa but then I need not mention that up stairs I cannot always hear it strike and Bridget is very se  dom there to come down for me and see what o'clock it is Now when I want to know if I descend myself that takes up much time whereas a watch at hand would let me know the time at once nor should I then  eed trouble any one or lose a moment of the day myself  Mr Ford  It is true a watch must be exceedingly convenient though it were but to inform one's writingmaster  that he has staid his time out if through friendship or politeness he should wish to sit a little longer with one  Clara  Dear papa how pleased you are to vex me upon all occasions with your banter  Mr Ford  Well then Clara if you desire more serious conversation tell me frankly why you so much wish to have a watch  Clara  I have papa already  Mr Ford  But I wish to know your real motive You are sensible words alone never satisfy meYou are afraid perhaps to tell me Well then I  will  for you and you will say yourself that I deal more frankly with you than you with me The reason why you want a watch is this that when folks pass you they may say "Oh see what a charming watch that little lady has She must be vastly rich indeed"Now tell me do not you think it very pitiful to boast of being richer than other people and to display fine things about you for the multitude to admire Do you fancy that any reasonable person will esteem a little lady more because her father has a great deal of money You yourself do you esteem those more who may be richer than you are When you behold a handsome watch and are not in the least acquainted with the wearer of it far from saying "There is a worthy little lady with a pretty watch before her" do not you rather say "What a charming watch that little lady wears"It is plain that if a watch does honour to any body it is to the workman but the wearer of it if she claims any merit from the possession of such a bauble I should despise for her vanity  Clara  You speak papa as if you were persuaded that I desire a watch from such a motive  Mr Ford  I must confess I grievously suspect as much but you will not allow it Well then I think I shall compel you very soon to such a confession  Clara  Oh do not tell me so papa for you must own a watch is very useful since you always have one you that talk so much against my vanity  Mr Ford  It is true but then you know I cannot do without one What I have to do at home is often interrupted by my public avocations or employment so that I must be exact and punctual in allowing each the necessary time  Clara  And must not I attend papa to a dozen different studies in the day What would any of my masters say if when they came I had prepared to sit down with another knowing nothing of the hour  Mr Ford  You are right You see by this I am not obstinate Whenever I hear reason I can say I love to be persuaded and so Clara you may depend upon a watch I will give you one  Clara  Ah now you joke papa  Mr Ford  No certainly for you shall have one but on this proviso that you do not forget to take it with you when you go abroad  Clara  Can you suppose that I shall forget it Oh how glad I should have been of one this afternoon when I was visiting at Miss Mills's  Mr Ford  You may go there again tomorrow morning  Clara  So I may and very probably Miss Richmond will still be there so let me have it early in the morning  Mr Ford  You shall have it now You know my little room up  irs Beside my bed you will find a watch that shall be yours Clara  Clara  What that great kettle of a watch papa as old for aught I know as King Harry the Eighth The case of it would serve to hold my little Pompey's breakfast of bread and milk  Mr Ford  It is a very good one I assure you and was all the fashion at the time it was made for so my father told me When he died I found it with the rest of his effects and was resolved to keep it for myself But since I put it into your possession I consider that it will not leave the family and as I shall often see it at your side it will still serve to remind me of my father  Clara  Yes but what will people say who are but ten years younger than my grandpapa would be at present  Mr Ford  Just the thing I expected You perceive the motive of utility which you insisted on just now with such importance was merely a pretext to hide your vanity for this same watch would do you all the service that you could possibly derive from one enriched with diamonds Why take up your thoughts with what the world may say concerning you However in this case they will  applaud your judgment which could chuse a watch for real service not for empty appearance  Clara  But papa why hinder me from having such a watch as will at once be strong and cut a handsome figure  Mr Ford  You suppose then that would make you happy  Clara  Yes quite happy  Mr Ford  I could wish that my fortune were sufficient to convince you by experience how fallacious is the happiness proceeding from such trifles Look ye I would lay whatever wager you thought proper that before a fortnight were well over you would hardly cast a look upon your watch that in a month you would forget to wind it up and very quickly after cease to keep it in a better state of order than your own ideas  Clara  Do not talk of wagers papa You would be sure to lose  Mr Ford  No I will not lay not that I apprehend I should come off the loser but because a trial would be necessary which might cost you dear as long as you live  Clara  So then you think papa that a handsome watch would only make me miserable  Mr Ford  Think so Clara I am sure it would have that effect for all our happiness on earth consists in being satisfied with such a situation as the will of Providence has meant us There is no condition in the world so humble or so elevated but a vain ambition in it may induce us to imagine ourselves in want of every thing that our neighbour possesses It is ambition that torments the husbandman however easy in his circumstances and inclines him to behold his neighbour's field with envy while it stimulates the master of a mighty empire and persuades him that some province bordering on his realm is wanting to complete the figure of its boundary Thence spring those cruel wars which princes carry on to desolate their people and those lawsuits in which individuals are engaged or those quarrels that disgrace man's nature What were your ideas with regard to that Miss Richmond that you mentioned just now when you were looking at the handsome watch that she displayed at her side Did you feel within your bosom that alacrity of friendship still subsisting in her favour which you once cherished Think would  you have done her at that moment any service or at least with equal joy as yesterday That secret enmity with which her watch inspired you against her would not such a watch inspire your friend or very possibly your sisters with the same against you also Think then for how despicable an enjoyment you would break the dearest ties of friendship and alliance and the affection which nature plants within us Who would think herself happy upon such conditions  Clara  O papa you make me shudder  Mr Ford  Then my sweet Clara entertain no more of these unreasonable wishes they cannot but destroy your happiness What is there wanting that you can find really useful in the situation which  rovidence allots you Have you not good food in plenty and convenient raiment for the various seasons of the year Does not my love provide you masters to improve your understanding while I form your heart and do my utmost to endue you with those several accomplishments that will in future make you welcome to all decent company You want it seems at present a gold watch enriched with diamonds Should I get you such a watch how would you look tomorrow upon your false pearl earrings Would you leave off teazing me till I had bought you real pearls Nor would this be all for you would then want foreign lace fine silks and waitingwomen to attend you People cannot go on foot like others through the streets when they are pompously set out from head to foot but must have footmen fashionable carriages and highbred horses You would want all these and having once obtained them would be fit indeed to go to operas and assemblies or pay visits at the houses of our firstrate quality but to receive them in your turn you must possess a splendid habitation and give sumptuous entertainments Consider then if I should satisfy your first caprice how many wants would follow They would every day go on increasing till in consequence of having wished to rise above your station in one article of luxury you would perhaps come to want the necessary things of life Look round about you and observe how many suffer real indigence at present who so lately as I may say as yesterday were wasting an estate sufficient for their happiness Reflect what very probably would be your case and that too  of your sisters if my great affection for you did not as it does at present turn these sad examples into matters of instruction I have frequently been tired while I was walking through the streets upon my business A good carriage would have eased my fatigue as much as it would have flattered my vanity By allotting to the purchase of a coach the money that I lay out on your education maintenance and amusements I might possibly be rolling in it for a time but in the end what would my fortune be and yours I should behold you every day sink deeper than the day before into stupidity and have no reason to expect from you in my old age those cares which I had refused your childhood For a few short years consumed in all the insolence of luxury I should be doomed to languish out the remnant of my life in that well merited contempt which a guilty poverty draws after it With what assurance could I think to answer at the judgmentseat of God for the omission of those duties towards you which the will of Providence imposes upon every father when I should have nothing to leave you for your inheritance but the sad example of my guilty conduct I should then finish my life in the convulsions of remorse despair and terror and your curses might even execrate my ashes  O papa cried Clara embracing him how foolishly have I been wishing But no watch set with diamonds now On the contrary if I had one I would instantly return it  Mr Ford was rejoiced to see his daughter so open to reason and persuasion and embraced her with the greatest heartfelt satisfaction  From that happy moment Clara resumed her former gaiety and whenever afterwards she saw any of her little friends make boast of precious stones or other ornaments about them was inclined much rather to take pity on their vanity than to look on them with the slightest envy  CAROLINE  THE amiable little Caroline of whom I have spoken once or twice before went out to Hampstead for a few weeks with her mama She had taken some new shoes for wear during her stay there but by dint of running about in the garden which was the usual scene of her play they were all very soon out at the toes Her mama bought her a pair for the present in the village and having occasion for some herself sent orders to her shoemaker in town to make her a few pair and to bring them up to Hampstead himself The man came in a few days and when Caroline's mother had tried hers she sent for the little girl to have her measure taken but she was not to be found The servants went to seek for her in the garden the pleasureground and all the rooms in the house but no Caroline The shoemaker after waiting a considerable time went away and he had not been gone many minutes before all of a sudden Miss Caroline made her appearance  Where have you been my dear said her mother Behind the curtain mama in your bedchamber answered she  But why did you hide yourself child Because the shoemaker was here  Well are you frightened at the sight of your shoemaker No mama but he would have seen by my shoes that they were not of his making All that I could say would have been of no service He would have thought that I had taken away my custom from him Poor Mr Vamp how grieved he would have been  THE WILD GEESE  LITTLE Richard Delaval one morning saw a great number of wild geese flying through the air and was astonished at the height and order of their progress  Look papa said Richard you take care to feed your geese but pray who feeds these wild geese  Mr Delaval  Nobody my dear  Richard  Then how do they live  Mr Delaval  By seeking food themselves you see they have wings  Richard  So have our geese that walk about the poultryyard Why do not they fly  Mr Delaval  Because all creatures that are once made tame degenerate as we say or lose a great deal of their strength and instinct  Richard  Luckily they are not very badly off for Martha gives them as much food as they want  Mr Delaval  It is true she feeds them regularly but I need tell you whythat we may eat them when they are fat but the wild geese have no fear of this sort hanging over them As they get food without assistance they enjoy the privileges of their freedom and thus it is too among mankind He that should without a blush rely entirely on the care and forethought of another for his maintenance would lose his birthright and be forced to sell himself for bread while he who on the other hand provides for what he wants acquires new faculties and is abundantly supported Not that we should live apart from one another or be wholly occupied upon ourselves for on the contrary these birds by whose behaviour I would have you regulate your conduct form among themselves a regular society They sit upon the eggs and nurse the young ones of such mothers as have lost their lives by any accident They likewise aid each other in their long and painful flights They take their station in the front by turns to guide the flock and regulate their flight Now Richard you must know these forts of geese originally formed but one Such difference will a different way of life effect in every creature  Richard  O papa no creeping in a poultryyard for me Give me those that enjoy their liberty and fly whereever they please  A TRIFLING PLEASURE EXCHANGED FOR ONE MUCH GREATER  Mrs Darley and her daughters Celia Harriet and Louisa  Louisa  DO you see mama we are ready I could wish the boat were come  Mrs Darley  A little patience It is not fix yet And till the watermen appear I think we had best walk up and down the garden  Harriet  Yes yes up and down the path that leads directly to the water When the boat comes we may then step in sit down and off directly  They force their mother towards the walk  Celia  Dear mama how fine a morning one can hardly see a cloud And look how bright the sun makes the water just as if it were full of diamonds We shall have a great deal of pleasure and be very happy to see our good nurse  Mrs Darley  And she will be as happy I am sure to see you likewise  Harriet  Pray mama how far does Maria live from this  Mrs Darley  We shall be at least an hour upon the water and then we shall have almost another hour's walk for Maria's house is at a good distance from the water  Harriet  Charming charming we shall have a better appetite for breakfast And when breakfast is over tell us how shall we divert ourselves mama  Mrs Darley  We will take a turn or two if you think proper in a grove that is near the house And there you may amuse yourselves and not be interrupted run about catch butterflies and let them go again  Celia  Let me conduct you sisters I have been there before with my mama and I will take you to a little pond so clear that any one may see the gravel at the bottom  Mrs Darley  Right I wonder that I forgot the pond We will sit beside it in the shade and read a little book that I have taken care to put into my pocket  Harriet  What a storybook mama And will it make us laugh  Mrs Darley  You shall see  Celia  But pray mama do not let us come from nurse's till the moon is up and then you will sing us that sweet song you know that makes one cry so much To be by moonlight on the water and hear such a song must be delightful sure  Harriet  who has run a little forward during this last speech  The boat the boat I see it coming Where is Louisa At the bottom of the garden when the boat stays for usLouisa  running towards her  the boat the boat  Louisa  coming up  The boat that is charming However give me each of you a sixpence there is a woman and a poor old man with four small children at the gardengate to whom I will take the money with a sixpence of my own I shall not detain you long  Mrs Darley  Where did you meet with these poor people  Louisa  At the gate below the gardener opened it to throw out some weeds that he had been raking up just before I put my head out to observe if any one was going by and two poor children came up to me O mama how tattered and how hungry they both seemed there were two other children not far off as little as my brother Paul  Mrs Darley  Come we will go and see them  Louisa  Yes yes that we will I bade them wait till I returned with something for them  They all go together towards the garden door and enter into conversation with them The old man is seated on a stone the woman leans against the pallisadoes with a sucking infant in her arms A girl about ten years old has one a little older than the infant and a boy is picking up the pebbles for amusement  Mrs Darley  aside  What a piteous sight  Aloud  Poor woman you can hardly stand Sit down upon this stone Whence come you pray  The Poor Woman  From Portsmouth my good lady I was married to a fisherman One night they pressed him and he served two years on board a man of war He came home almost dying with the scurvy He had lost his strength and could not work I was obliged to sell his  nets that I might buy him physic but his illness lasted very long Our creditors laid hold of every thing that we had and as we could not pay our debts our landlord turned us out of doors A neighbour very nearly as distressed as we were took us in and robbed his children of a part of what they had to eat that we might not be left to perish Being brought to such a distressed situation I fell ill with grief and shortly after my poor husband died As soon as I was a little better I resolved to be no further burthensome to my good benefactor but set out to seek assistance from a worthy lady with whom I once lived as servant at Epsom We are still a great way from it and I do not know how we shall be able to reach it I am not able to go any farther  Mrs Darley  And who may that poor man be  The Poor Woman  He is my father madam He has lived a great while with us and I thought I should have been in circumstances to have still provided for him but I am disappointed in my hopes Alas his situation adds to my affliction Having neither shoes nor stockings he was walking yesterday across a common and unfortunately a thorn run into his foot I took it out but his fatigue has grievously inflamed the wound his leg is now quite swelled and he can hardly touch the ground it gives him so much pain for heaven's sake my good lady have the charity to give me two or three old rags to wrap the wound up when I have washed it and a bit of bread for these poor children  Mrs Darley  You shall have whatever you want I will go up into the house and see what I have that I can give you In the mean time come into the garden and sit down on these four chairs  She takes her daughters who had all the while been listening to the woman's conversation and goes up the garden with them Celia had expressed her pity at the tale by shedding tears Louisa by dividing into equal parts among the little ones a bit of cake that she had provided for her journey as refreshment by the way and Harriet by relieving her that had the infant of her burthen as she seemed quite exhausted  Mrs Darley  in conversation with her daughters while they are walking towards the house  Well children what think you of these six poor people Run you Celia with your sister to the cook and help her to prepare them  something for their breakfast I will pay a visit to your father's wardrobe and get linen shoes and stockings for the poor old man I am sorry that I can be of no great service to them  Celia  Indeed it will be no great matter for them in their situation Do not you recollect they are still to walk as far as Epsom They must go very slowly as the old man is lame If then they should be taken ill upon the roadMama you are very charitable to the poor suppose you were to let them have a little money that they may go by some waggon and have a trifle over to supply them when they come to Epsom until they find the lady that they mention  Mrs Darley  Do you know me then so little my dear Celia as to think that I should not have this notion of myself if I were able But alas it is no way in my power for you are sensible we are not rich I cannot possibly afford them as much as would be necessary for their relief in that way  Celia  If what we have were sufficient  Harriet  We would give it to them with all our hearts  Mrs Darley  And how much have you  Celia  I havelet me seeone two three four and sixpence and these halfpence four and tenpence  Harriet  I have halfacrown  Mrs Darley  And you Louisa  Louisa  I have nothing left me I had sixpence just this moment but I slipt it into the poor man's hand  Mrs Darley  You have then you two but seven and sixpence nearly which is half enough to pay their carriage I can think of but  way to complete the money  Celia  And what is that mama  Mrs Darley  I do not know how to mention it  Harriet  Why not  Louisa  Fear nothing let us know it  Mrs Darley  The excursion that we intend to make today I have promised you a long time it is to recompense your good behaviour and believe me I have denied myself this month past many things that I might save as much as it will cost us for you know we must not only pay for the boat but when we reach a town we must lay out a little to give Maria as a present for the expence  that we put her to in treating us This money is in my purse but I consider it belongs to you and leave you to employ it at your pleasure Should we add it to your pocketmoney there would be then a sufficiency to have a cart for these poor people and to procure them victuals until they reach Epsom but the sacrifice I must acknowledge is too great I dare not recommend it Our long wished for day's excursion would be lost this year  Louisa  Dear me  Mrs Darley  To say the truth I shall myself be sorry it were lost So run Louisa and tell the watermen that we are coming  Louisa  Presently mama  She stops and views her sisters with concern  Harriet  What shall we do  Celia  For my part I know what I would do  Harriet  And I too were it not for poor Louisa  Louisa  Oh do not pity me I am only grieved upon Maria's account but I will write to her by the coach that goes at nine  Celia  joyfully  Well then mama we are all of us agreed So take our money and let these poor people have it  Mrs Darley  But perhaps you have not thought enough Refiect how fine a day it is and what pleasure you would have  Celia  But I shall have no pleasure when I think that I am sailing at my ease while six poor people drag along the road just ready to drop down with weariness because I had no pity on them  Harriet  Are they not the same as we are They will certainly have enough to suffer before they die and we should not grudge them the small assistance that we can give them  Mrs Darley  Do you say nothing Louisa  Louisa  I was thinking all the while mama that our pleasure is not lost for we shall follow them a mile or two while they are riding in the cart which will be still a walk for us and very pleasant  Mrs Darley  embracing them  O my lovely children How rejoiced I am to find that you have such feeling and compassion You will never want enjoyments in the world  since you can turn your disappointments into pleasures Come then we will not lose a moment's time in having this enjoyment  Mrs Darley now goes in and sends a servant out to pay the watermen The three young children go and come between the house and garden with assistance for the man the woman and her children Celia helps the woman while she tends the old man's wound and Harriet and Louisa give the children victuals after which they all return to their mama  Harriet  Ah my dear mama you should have seen with how much eagerness and joy the children looked at both Louisa and myself when we were come with milk and bread to feed them They all crouded about their mother looked up in her face and were so glad that they did not know what to do  Louisa  For my part I began to be afraid they would have eat me up so famished were they and desirous to be eating  Celia  Sure mama the elder girl must be a charming child She would not touch a bit till she had made her little brother eat who is too young as yet to feed alone  Mrs Darley  Poor thing she is greatly to be pitied If the care of looking to the little ones be always laid upon her she will have no opportunity of getting any thing like knowledge and be very miserable all her lifetime whereas had she the means of learning some business she might prove of service to her mother and assist her in bringing up the others  Louisa  Well mama do one thing for her Let her stay with us I will teach her whatever I know myself She will be able very soon to knit and few when she may sell her work and send the money to her mother  Harriet  No bad thought mama I take it  Celia  Yes do us this pleasure pray mama for what a pity that the poor girl should come to want merely for not knowing how to work at any business like the poor old woman that we all know She would then turn beggar and receive no benefit from what we are now doing for her  Mrs Darley  But do you know my dear what you would undertake Reflect a little  Celia  Why mama  Mrs Darley  I will tell you why If we should take this girl into the house we must give her cloaths I cannot go to the expence unless you are willing that I shall take a little from  your  dress and make up by that means what it will cost And so instead of those silk slips that I meant to give you very shortly you must be content with linen gowns or perhaps stuff and have no feathers or Italian flowers upon your head nothing but a ribband round your hat  Celia  And yet mama I told Miss Raby and her sister Kitty that I should very shortly have a fine silk slip as good as theirs  Harriet  A linen gown will never look so well as one of silk will it pray  Mrs Dariey  Certainly it will not  Harriet  having thought a little  But if that will not become me so well as silk would the poor girl will cut a much worse figure in her rags  Celia  And then if she continues thus half uncovered much longer she may run the risque of being taken ill besides the inconveniences that want of clean cloathing may bring upon her for you know mama you have often told me how unwholesome dirty cloaths are  Mrs Darley  Yes indeed I have but you Louisa what say you to my proposal Should you like to put a stuff gown on  Louisa  Oh very much mama One jumps the better for it I remember what the  Children's Friend  said lately in the story of poor Matilda whose fine cloaths occasioned her so much anxiety when she was out a walking with her little friends and sought to mortify them with the sight of her silk slip embroidered shoes and frizzled head of hair  Mrs Darley  Well then we are likely I perceive to fix on something and yet this is not the whole Louisa it was you that first offered to instruct the little girl in sewing and of course I ought to give the preference to you in such a charge but then you must confess yourself a  too giddy for it and besides not qualified entirely Neither I or Celia can pretend to undertake it as the business of the house already takes up our attention W  then Harriet I give that employment to you  Harriet  Thank you dear mama  Mrs Darley  Wait some few days however till you thank me You can hardly guess what patience you will need to go through the employ I know you Harriet you are sometimes very hasty and at first you must expect that the little girl will hardly comprehend your meaning You will beat her perhaps if you do so I shall then be forced against my will to punish you Well dare you promise me that you will never let your peevish disposition get the better of you  Harriet  I must say the truth mama that is what I cannot promise I suppose you recollect the other day when you reproved me I could then have laid my life that I should never do the same again but you had hardly left the room when poor Louisa went to put her stockings on and broke a stitch that ran from top to bottom I had so much work to take it up again I fell into a passion and even beat her I was quite ashamed a moment after but it was done and could not be mended then  Mrs Darley  It is singular indeed that children who have need themselves of such indulgence should have none for others Truly you would cut a pretty figure in society if I were never to correct you for this fault  Harriet  I wish for nothing half so much as to be cured of it  Celia  For my part dear mama I think no method can be half so good for such a purpose as to trust her with this office  Harriet  I may quarrel with my sister since she is not my debtor but depend upon it I will be much more patient and goodnatured with my scholar otherwise she might imagine that I was grieved for having been of service to her  Mrs Darley  And dear Celia you must have an eye to see that they do things properly  Celia  Yes yes mama I will be the inspector general  Mrs Darley  Come then let us make haste and carry our poor people this good news I hope their joy will both encourage and reward your kindness  MATILDA  YOU remember my dear little friends the raging heat that made last summer so remarkable I recollect it I assure you to my sorrow since by having an effect upon my health it hindered me for many weeks from satisfying your impatience to hear from me To indemnify you therefore for so tedious though unwilling a delay I shall relate an interesting circumstance which happened when that heat was at the greatest  I went down to Windsor on a visit to a lady who instils such excellent principles into her children as justify the choice that was made of her mother to superintend the education of a certain august family We were all engaged in innocent amusement when a furious storm began to rise the thunder rolled above us with a dreadful noise and shook the house to its very foundation while the lightning seemed as if it would consume the dwelling every moment One young lady of the company could not help being frightened There were heard cries and shrieks proceeding from a chambermaid in one of the apartments In the midst of this confusion little Matilda disappeared Her noble mother who was passing from one chamber to another saw her kneeling in a corner  The Mother  What are you about there my dear child  Matilda  Oh nothing nothing  The Mother  Are you frightened at the storm  Matilda  Oh no mama You have instructed me yourself if you remember not to fear the thunder and you saw just now I was not in the least afraid  The Mother  And why then were you kneeling  Matilda  I observed Eliza tremble I heard Kitty cry and that made me unhappy I was praying therefore for them and for every one that is afraid of thunder  SEQUEL TO THE MILITARY ACADEMY  A DRAMA in One ACT  CHARACTERS  CAPTAIN BARTON  Mrs BARTON  EDWARD  their Children  PAUL  their Children  THEODORE  their Children  CLAUDIA  their Children  ISABEL  their Children  The MASTER  of the Military Academy  EUGENIUS  his Son  PIPES  an old Serjeant  SCENE  An apartment in Mr Barton's House  SCENE I  Paul Theodore Claudia Isabel Pipes Claudia and Isabel are both employed the one in reading and the other at her tambour frame Theodore has a pencil and is drawing Paul shoulders Pipes's crutch  Pipes  to Paul  MAKE readyPresentFire Come very wellAnother lesson will compleat youGive me back my crutch  To Claudia and Isabel  You will never let me teach  you  then  Claudia  Teach  us  Isabel  Young ladies  Pipes  And why not A soldier's children should all learn their exercise One never looks so well as with a firelock  Claudia  Particularly when a crutch must represent it  Pipes  True but I mistake it frequently myself Miss Claudia and incline to put it rather  on  than  underneath  my shoulder It is in truth a sort of instinct in me my first motion Ah poor Pipes to have a crutch instead  of musquet in my hand These ten years I have carried it about and am not yet accustomed to its use  Paul  But recollect Pipes at your age you would certainly have been otherwise dismist  Pipes  Dismist what mean you master Paul Had it not been for my wooden leg I should have died a soldier Cursed leg Ten hundred times a day I find myself disposed to make a bonfire of it Instead of a fine white spatterdash when I see nothing but a wooden stump I hardly know myself and fall into a passion  Theodore  Would you wish to have it otherwise Why man it is nothing but the fortune of war  Isabel  And is it thus that Theodore comforts you Do not be afflicted Pipes  Pipes  You are in the right my dear Miss Isabel for after all it bears me witness that I have seen hot service If my leg had not been in the fire it would hardly be so dry now In fact I know some legs that are at present in their place because they carried the wearers of them out of danger and I would not change my wooden leg for twenty such Young gentlemen it is happy for you both that you are to serve but take my counsel and lose arms as well as legs much rather than receive the least degree of spot in your honour for want of courage  Theodore  Yes I promise you I will  Paul  And so will I when I am fighting I will have you always in my thoughts  Pipes  Do master Paul Your brave father and myself  Barton  and  Pipes  shall be your charging words With there two names between your lips you will always be first to do your duty  SCENE II  Theodore Paul Claudia Isabel Pipes Captain Barton who has entered towards the close of the preceding scene  The Children  seeing Capt Barton run together towards him and cry all at once  Here is papa  Capt Barton  embracing them  Good morrow to you all my dears Good morrow to you Pipes  holding out his hand  and thank you heartily for your instructions to my children  Pipes  Ah sir my instructions I bestow upon them with a great deal of pleasure when you are not by but seeing you I am almost sorry  Capt Barton  And why so my friend  Pipes  Because I see by your example what the fruits of it are If I am wise then shall I study to make soldiers of your children that they may be dismissed after they have worn themselves out in the service  Capt Barton  But why call my fortune back thus to remembrance since I myself have laboured to forget it and complain no longer of what you suppose hard usage  Pipes  Please your honour then I will complain for both Bombs and cannons is it not a shame What turn me off for having one leg less A soldier is always fit for duty if his heart and his head are left him If they think that we cripples make no shew at a review why let them keep us for a battle we will be put into a corps apart we won't even condescend to mix with others No affront to your Grenadiers or your Highlanders we will be first of all I warrant you dear master  Capt Barton  smiling  Good old friend how much I am pleased to see this fire of youth and courage burning still within you  Pipes  I am quite vexed to see you smile when you should storm much more than I do I am a vulgar deg I am nobody and they may think that they ought to overlook me having lost a limb but  you  a Captain who have had so many wounds in twenty battles and have such a family of children to put such a one as you on what they call halfpay and send him off without a pension who can think of such a treatment and be pass at  Capt Barton  I find fault with no one There are others more unhappy  He turns to Paul and the rest who seem uneasy  My good little ones you have done enough this morning to require some recreation Go then but first visit your mama she is in her chamber  The Children  Yes papa and afterwards we will come back to study  SCENE III  Captain Barton Pipes  Capt Barton  My old friend I am pleased with your affection but still I do not like that you should speak before my children as you do I would not have them think themselves authorized to hate their fellowcreatures such a notion would discourage them in their pursuit of fortune and besides they are destined to acquire themselves a reputation by their actions Is it likely that they should take pains for such a purpose if they are told beforehand that men merit only their contempt  Pipes  ironically  Yes yes your honour has great reason to defend mankind they have respected you so much  Capt Barton  There are more good than wicked men about us and if there were only you that thought would reconcile me to humanity  Pipes  bowing  Oh Captain  Capt Barton  You have been so willing to attach yourself to my ill fortune and besides you know I am indebted to your friendship for the preservation of my life  Pipes  And if I saved it I was under obligation to do nothing less my worthy Captain for your having sent me to the drill so often Had it not been for your honour Pipes would have turned out a vagabond and drunkard like many others It was your attention that mace a man of me I should have been my whole life long a common soldier had you let me grovel on From rank to rank I have been promoted and at last made serjeant and that is something every one will grant me and no inconsiderable lift towards colonel But a plague upon the musquetball say I that to my heart of oak has added this deal leg  Capt Barton  Come Pipes you have now repose and that is as good as honour always  Pipes  I shall never have repose as long as I observe your honour ill at ease The produce of your farm this year has failed and I am now become a burthen to you  Capt Barton  Can a child become a burthen to his father And pray are you not as one among my children  Thanks to heaven I shall be always sure of a subsistence If our ration is a little less there shall be still an equal share for you Pipes  Pipes  And I take it but have hopes that I shall be able to acknowledge all your favours handsomely as I have met with an employment  Capt Barton  So much the better Pipes I am charmed to hear that you have so for  your  sake What is it  Pipes  Could you have supposed what I am now going to tell you But it is true sir that a hosier offered me the other day employment in his shop if I would knit him stockings  Capt Barton  Very good at least you will not be idle by accepting it  Pipes  How sir very good I could have knocked the fellow down but that my crutch had tumbled on the ground  Capt Barton  I hope this knocking people down is not the employment that you mean  Pipes  It would be better far than what the hosier meant to give me A fine sight indeed Pipes knitting like a woman I would see his stock of knittingneedle  at Jericho first and yet this circumstance made me think a little I can work it is true said I to myself so I went to Mr Wilkinson's and told him that I would furbish up his old sword blades if he would but employ an ancient soldier He consented so that I shall have the handling still of warlike weapons and beside receive a shilling a day Let me beg captain that you will accept it for my maintenance  Capt Barton  No no my friend keep what you earn yourself A drop of liquor now and then is necessary to a person of your age  Pipes  A drop of liquor Oh I will take care how I play at such a game as that again I know myself too well I should drink a single drop today a pint would hardly be enough tomorrow and so on  Capt Barton  But you have other calls for money and for my part I want nothing  Pipes  Nothing when you almost live on bread and water Nay now captain you are far too proud believe me and refuse my shilling for no other reason than because I am not your equalA vengeance on this wooden  leg of mine that has prevented me from being now a colonel for what any one can tell  Capt Barton  You do not know me yet I can see my friend for were I to accept a gift from any one it should be only from the king and you  Pipes  What both of us together thus and in a breath  Capt Barton  My king is but my master In my friend I see a sort of God and you Pipes are the only friend that is left me  Pipes  throwing himself into the captain's arms  Well then my friendCaptain take my shilling  Capt Barton  I have already told you I could put it to no use and did not misinform you but on second thoughts a time may come when I shall need a great deal more Lay by as much as you can save out of this daily shilling that whenever I may want your savings you may then assist me  Pipes  Oh I understand you It is for my sake rather than your own that you counsel me to act thus savingly No matter I will pursue your counsel literally and my money shall be sacred It shall go in nothing but tobacco and I will take care how I fall into a passion that I may not break my pipe  Capt Barton  I praise your resolution but at present go and smoke one to the honour of our friendship Mrs Barton I observe is coming and I wish to have a little conversation with her by myself  Pipes  Yes yes I will leave you and besides a little air will be of service to me Your discourse has had I do not know what effect upon my spirits I shall quickly be composed again  SCENE IV  Captain Barton Mrs Barton  Mrs Barton  What circumstance has happened my dear life You sent the children to me and I thought I saw upon their countenances something not quite natural to them I conceived it not so proper to ask  them  the reason but would come and know the whole from you Hide nothing from me I beseech you Has any new misfortune  happened that it is in my power to lighten by giving you comfort  Capt Barton  No my dear With your assistance I can bear all sorrows and if unforeseen affliction were to come upon me would not hesitate to tell you of it after the experience that I have had of your philosophy and fortitude But be of comfort Thank Heaven nothing fatal or unfortunate has happened  Mrs Barton  What then could occasion the uneasiness that I noticed in their countenances  Capt Barton  Our old soldier caused it whose excess of zeal and friendship for me carried him so far while they were present as to vent complains concerning the injustice of my lot I observed that they were affected by the strength of his expressions and because I apprehended such invectives might inspire discouragement I directed them to go into your chamber so that Pipes's murmurs might not make a bad impression on them being followed instantly by your caresses  Mrs Barton  Poor unhappy little things Alas they know not what a sad condition they are to experience upon earth  Capt Barton  I hope their fortune will not be so lamentable as your motherly affection seems to fear for hitherto at least they have no great occasion to complain of their condition  Mrs Barton  What my dear when they are utterly deprived of all the advantages that they might reasonably have expected in life  Capt Barton  They never knew them therefore never can the want of those advantages afflict them Possibly they might have only served to soften and unnerve their strength as well as understanding The hard life to which they have been used has given them a robust and sound constitution and an energy of mind Instead of pursuing frivolous or puerile amusements they already know how to convert their labour into pleasure If God's providence should grant them any of the gifts of fortune they will therefore yield the more enjoyment but supposing they are all decreed to pass away their days in the privation of this life's conveniences they will have learnt to undergo their fortune without murmurs or complainings Shall I tell you what I think my dear I do not look on  the condition to which we are destined as so very lamentable for surrounded by the pleasures of the world should we have known those tender sentiments for each other which we certainly have learnt in what men call the school of adversity Hurried on by pleasure we should each have gone in quest of friends who would have left us in adversity and perhaps aggravated our afflictions by their treachery while now afflicted as we are we are convinced that we have it in our power to make each other happy by our mutual love and friendship There are many miserable individuals in the world who are even destitute of bread to eat we have never experienced such a want though we have not stooped to procure our bread by dishonour If as is the case we are necessitated to put up with what may certainly be called a very common diet that our children may not want for educationwe enjoy on the other hand their gratitude and their improvement in knowledge We are conscious to ourselves that we have neglected no one tittle of our duty to them Every generous notion that they possess is our work it is our lessons and example that have enabled them to possess it They will do no laudable or virtuous action in their future lives but what an honest pride will permit us to attribute to ourselves and granting that any one among them should be raised into distinction by his merit I am confident he will not leave us in old age when we may more particularly want his succour  Mrs Barton  O my dear my worthy husband how does your fortitude sustain me  Capt Barton  On the contrary dear partner it is your constancy that upholds my fortitude Without support I should have long since sank beneath the burthen of my sorrows but seeing you renounce the delicacies and subdue the weaknesses inseparable from your sex that you might properly discharge your duty how could I have seemed less firm than you were and not have blushed at being called a man  Mrs Barton  Ascribe not so much honour to me for the sacrifices that I have made They must be nothing to a mother's sensibility and I would make still greater if on such conditions I might have the prospect of a happier fortune to befal my children But my dear have you renounced all thoughts of soliciting your friends Are  you without a hope that such solicitations would be attended with success  Capt Barton  You know the issue of my former applications If then I experienced nothing but denials when more recent services spoke for me shalt I hope a better fortune now and if the hollowhearted friend who then deceived me would not second my just expectations with his influence who will now espouse the application of a man so many years forgot My very silence since that period would be urged as a pretext for new refusals and fresh disappointments but reopen wounds as yet not quite healed up I have thrown away almost my whole dependence to procure me nothing but vexation I shall therefore hardly be so rash as to consume what is left me in such steps as if they failed would end in desperation  Mrs Barton  Desperation  Capt Barton  Yes though they should cost me nothing but the time that I must purloin from the instruction of my children If I durst have any hopes and should again be disappointed I am convinced I could not possibly survive or should at least drag on the wretched remnant of my life in sorrow No dear spouse let us not imitate those parents who imagine that they have done enough in yielding some small portion of their superfluities and that too with reluctance that their children may obtain an education Let us prove our love by dedicating even our necessaries to their wants Let us consent to live on bread if such a sacrifice be needful that in future they may shew themselves to have been educated in a manner worthy of us  Mrs Barton  And I trust in the Almighty that they will do so for sure we have not given life to monsters  Capt Barton  I have already such a hope concerning Edward Child although he is yet I have frequently remarked his depth of understanding openness of temper and ingenuous way of thinking qualities that I would desire to find in my friend He will have two motives for seeking advancement and those such as operate very forcibly on noble minds he will have obstacles to overcome and thereby so much the more glory to acquire With what ardour have I observed him and particularly these two years last past to resign himself entirely up to study and digest the greatest difficulties With what enthusiasm  has he been seized at the recital of some glorious action I have often noted him retiring as it were in thought that he might narrowly examine the transactions both of Rome and Sparta and observe the infancy of their most celebrated heroes In a search like this no wonder that the atchievements of a Cyrus should inflame his nature to resemble him in temperance fortitude and reputation On the whole I verily believe that nothing but some happy circumstance is wanting to proclaim him such already as he may one day shew himself to be  Mrs Barton  But my dear in such a  tuation as he is doomed to at present when alas can we have hope that this happy circumstance will happen  Capt Barton  To the weak man it can hardly ever happen a great heart will frequently create it Yes my Edward there is hardly any thing that I have not room to hope from you  SCENE V  Captain Barton Mrs Barton Paul Theodore Claudia Isabel  Paul  You were speaking I believe papa about my brother  Capt Barton  True I was so Paul You are sensible there is scarce a moment of the day in which I do not think of one or other of you  Isabel  Have you had any letter from him  Capt Barton  Not today but then I know him my dear child so well that I can tell at any time what he is about without his writing to me For example I am sure that at this very moment he is thinking to afford me a proof of his affection by a diligent attention to his studies Paul I am sure his good behaviour will be serviceable to your introduction when the time comes round that you must go to school and have the same instructor  Paul  And for my part as you know papa I am to go before Theodore I will do every thing in my power to introduce  him  likewise with the same degree of credit  Capt Barton  I was sure within myself that you would have made me such a promise In your present situation  my dear little fellows destitute as you are sensible you are of wealth and patrons your advancement in the world must be at first entirely owing to yourselves since it depend upon the efforts you will make at all times to excel each other And what is more the elevation of all three may be the happy consequence of good behaviour in one only as the bad behaviour of one only may involve the other two and be a bar to their good fortune So that you may see on one hand what disgrace and on the other hand what honour may be expected from the turn of your conduct  Paul  But papa you know we heard Pipes say just now that you had not been recompensed for your service  Theodore  I am sure however you were never found deficient in your duty  Isabel  So pray tell us why the king has for so many years forgot you  Capt Barton  Possibly because there have been many to reward much worthier than myself or else because the expences of his government prevent his generosity besides I have neglected for a long long time indeed all applications to his justice that the time which they would have taken up might be better employed upon your education But when once you enter into public life you will be able by a proper conduct on your part to turn his royal eye upon your father and if so I shall enjoy his benefits twice over  Paul  Oh if it depends upon my conduct  Theodore  What and shall we then be able to repay you every thing that you have done on our account  Capt Barton  Yes and to the full I will not raise the value of those sacrifices which your good mother and myself have made to your instruction We have constantly submitted to them unrepiningly and even with the greatest pleasure Providence already recompenses us by planting in your hearts the promise of those virtues that will gratify our hopes But if you were in future to deceive us and conduct yourselves in such a manner that the fruit of all our sacrifices would be lost what then would be the dismal consequencesyour poor sisters brought to poverty your mother in despair and my grey hairs descending to the grave with sorrow  Paul  No it never shall be so  Theodore  And therefore if you love us be assured we shall do every thing in our power to make you happy  Capt Barton  My existence totally depends upon you and through you I am to live or die  Paul  In that case you will live while we have one single drop of blood within us  Theodore  We will rather die a thousand times than willingly dishonour you  Capt Barton  Well I receive my children this assurance in the light of Heaven and can have nothing else to wish I will be indebted to you for the greatest happiness that is to be enjoyed in this world  Claudia  O papa how badly off are we who cannot by our conduct make you happy  Capt Barton  You may make my happiness still greater by so acting as in this retirement to occasion me the permanent and tranquil joys peculiar to a father What will there be wan  ing to my happiness it while your brothers honour my old age by then laudable actions you together with your sister comf  it with your attention and adorn it with your virtue  what additional felicity can I entreat of Heaven if I but live to see you merit the di  nction gained you by the s  me and glory  f your brothers  He  Mrs Barton by the hand whom an excess of  had rendered speech  ess during all the scene  Dearest wife  you imagine what would be our transports at so fair a prospect when both joy and honour caused by each of nose to whom we gave birth should fill up our dwelling  Paul  You say nothing dear mama  Claudia  You weep  Mrs Barton  It is for joy my children I was indulging myself beforehand in the happiness which your father has just described  Paul  Oh we promise that we will do our utmost not to disappoint you Yes upon our knees we promise you And as for Edward I will answer for him just as he himself would were he present  They fall upon their knees before her she affectionately raises and embraces them as does likewise their father  SCENE VI  Captain Barton Mrs Barton Paul Theodore Claudia Isabel Pipes  Pipes  rushing all at once into the room  O my worthy captain  Capt Barton  What is the matter  Pipes  I have seen him He is returned  Capt Barton  Returnedwho Pipes  Pipes  He sir my best friend the only friend I have except indeed your honour  Capt Barton  Edward do you mean  Mrs Barton  My son  Paul  My brother  Claudia and Isabel  Wherewhere is he  Theodore  O my dearest Pipes is Edward coming  Pipes  Do you ask me when I have told you Why he almost beat me backward throwing as he did his arms about my neck The excellent young man still still the same He is coming after me I hear him on the stairs  Mrs Barton  But why does he return Oh heaven he has been only ten days absent Is it possible that  Capt Barton  interrupting her  What suspect my Edward This is the first reason for displeasure that you have ever caused me  Mrs Barton  Pardon my uneasiness And yet what are we to suppose on this occasion  Capt Barton  Any thing or every thing much rather than imagine that he has done amiss  SCENE VII  Captain Barton Mrs Barton Edward Paul Theodore Claudia Isabel Pipes  Edward  entering to his father who springs forward and embraces him  My dear dear father how rejoiced I am to see you  Capt Barton  My dear Edward is it youKiss me my dear child and againWhat can be the reason of your coming back so unexpectedly  Edward  It is mentioned in this paper Read read read  He gives a paper and then running up to his mother falls into her arms  My dear mama you will be very happy  He returns to his brothers and sisters and salutes them  And how are you dearest Isabel and Claudia and you Paul and Theodore You were far from expecting to see me so soon were you not However you will be glad of my return when you know the reason of it  Isabel  Oh we are glad already without knowing it  Edward  I had drawn up a letter yesterday for my papa with good news in it and the promise of much better but my master being then upon the point of setting out for London on the subject of that better news thought proper to detain the letter and succeeding in the object of his journey it was instantly determined that I should come myself this morning which was full as well I fancy was it not  Claudia  Oh certainly  Capt Barton  What is this A pension of three hundred pounds a year the king allows me  Mrs Barton  Is it possible  Pipes  Bombs and cannons if it were but true  All the Children  How how papa  Capt Barton  There read the whole yourself dear spouredAnd who is the generous man that has thus condescended to enumerate my services in presence of the king when every one besides him had abandoned me The king then knows that I have not served him without some degree of honour O my prince I could certainly have been happy though deprived of your munificence but not of your esteem Dear Edward who has been my benefactor  SCENE the last  Captain Barton Mrs Barton Paul Theodore Claudia Isabel Pipes Edward the Master of the Military School Eugenius  Edward runs out hastily and very soon returns bringing in his master by the hand  Edward  Here is our friend and second father See here too my brother Eugenius A new son for you and my mama  The Master  Pardon me sir that I have been so free as to intrude upon you without leave I was not willing I confess to lose the affecting scene to which I am witness at present  Capt Barton  You may well expect the liberty of being witness to it since it is all of your creation  Mrs Barton  And has wherewithal no doubt to gratify your benevolent heart  The Master  I am indeed most happy madam to perform a character therein though not the hero It is to Edward to your son that the honour of that character appertains  Mrs Barton  To Edward  Capt Barton  To my son  The Master  You had deprived yourself of every comfort in this life that you might form his heart and understanding and on his part he deprived himself of his enjoyments to evince the gratitude that he owed you Pardon me good sir if I appear acquainted with the secrets of your family Your  n has not betrayed them It was I who read them in his bosom Ever since his first commencement with us he would take to sustenance but bread and water All our menaces were not sufficient to procure an explanation of his motives to such abstinence and by insinuation only did I come to know it He resolved to be no happier than his father who denied himself so many things on his account We spoke about you and I learned your situation I have had no other merit than the trifling one of causing intimation of it to be made to our good sovereign but your name it seems was in  his recollection and he said as I was told that he thought himself quite happy in the means of recompensing as he did your ancient services as well as the care that you took in bestowing such an education on your children as must render them the most valuable of his subjects The worthy nobleman who mentioned your affair to his majesty even told me that in saying these words he shed tears  Capt Barton  O sir forgive the weaknesses of nature I had strength sufficient to endure misfortunes but not half enough to bear such joy My son my dearest Edward are you capable of such generous affection to your father  Edward  Pardon me I have but for a moment done in your behalf what you have been doing for so many years on my account  He turns towards his mother who is just upon the point of fainting  My dear mama do not die I beseech you now that you are rich  Mrs Barton is revived in consequence of his solicitude and almost overwhelms him with embraces  The Master  What an affecting picture Edward you remember th  t I also mean to be your father  Edward  Oh yes always always So papa embrace Eugenius my new brother we have sworn for ever to love one another  Eugenius  Yes and I on my side never shall forget my promise  They embrace each other ardently as do Captain Barton and the Master  The Master  I have been so free sir as to bring him with me to your house that he might contemplate the virtues that flourish in it He had read the heart of Edward many days before myself and he it was who first of all desired his friendship  Captain Barton  If you give him thus a friend in the person of my son I ought to find another for him in the person of his father  The Master  I can wish for nothing with such ardour as I do such a title and on my part offer you my pledge of friendship  Holding out his hand  Pipes  I can be no longer an indifferent looker on  he lets fall his crutch and rushes in between them  Excuse me sir but where my Captain gives his heart  mine  also  must go with it You are a generous man were you not Pipes would never flatter you by calling you so  Capt Barton  You will pardon sir the bluntness of a soldier he is full of honour and this mark of his affection for me cannot be a matter of indifference to you It has been my consolation under many sorrows  The Master  Say you so then I take his affection in good part Your hand comrade for soldiers are all brothers  Pipes  O my other good supporter where are you now But I will dance without you at the thought of such a happy day  THE WIG THE SHOULDER OF MUTTON THE LANTERNS THE SACK OF CORN AND THE STILTS  MR Friendly was one afternoon at home and in the drawing room with his four children Lambert Charlotte Dorothy and Felix when three gentlemen whose names were Vernon Fairfield and Fitzwilliam came to see him They were Mr Friendly's oldest friends the children likewise loved them greatly and were very much rejoiced to see them They would always listen to their conversation with a greedy ear as being not only instructive but amusing and on this particular occasion sat with such attention that they let the night come on without once thinking that they wanted candles Mr Vernon was by this time relating a very curious circumstance that happened to him in his travels when a dreadful noise was heard from the second pair of stairs The children crowded together in a fright behind their father's elbow chair instead of going out and seeing what was the matter as Mr Friendly thought they would have done He had bid Lambert his eldest son step out but Lambert passed the order to his sister Charlotte Charlotte to her younger sister Dorothy and Dorothy to Felix  During these negociations which indeed were all transacted in a minute's time the noise continued and came nearer but not one among them left his station  Mr Friendly eyed them with a look which seemed to ask if he or his friends should take the trouble to rise and see what accident had happened  Upon this the four began their march together towards the door but in the figure of a square battalion each supported by the other They were now come near the door when Lambert with a fearful step advanced his foot and opened it but instantly fell back into his former place The little ones however were not in the least delivered from their terror when they saw an apparition clothed in white and crawling on all fours In short our  Sosias  at the sight turned tail and setting up a shriek retreated towards their father who rose from his seat and going towards the landingplace cried out who is there  I sir replied a voice that seemed to issue from the flooring  I said Mr Friendly And pray who are you  The barber's boy sir looking for your wig  Think little friends what bursts of laughter now succeeded their preceding silence Mr Friendly rang the bell for light and when it came perceived the wigbox broken to pieces and the unfortunate wig entangled about the boy's right foot  The tumult of this laughable adventure scarce was over when the father ridiculed the folly of his children asking what they had been thus afraid of They could hardly tell themselves as having been accustomed from the cradle not to be afraid at night and as the several servants in the family were expressly forbidden to tell them any foolish stories about ghosts or goblins  Their preceding conversation being thus deranged it came at last to turn upon this subject and they wished to know what could occasion those surprising fears so common to all children in darkness  It is the natural effects of darkness and that only answered Mr Vernon As children cannot properly distinguish objects round them in the dark their imagination which is always smitten with the marvellous  shapes them out extraordinary figures by enlarging or contracting what they look at just as circumstances govern Upon this the notion of their weakness easily persuades them they are utterly unable to resist those monsters which they think armed to hurt them Terror thus obtains possession of them and too frequently impresses fears which have the worst of consequences  They would be ashamed said Mr Friendly if they saw in open day what often gives them so much fright by night  It was for all the world said Lambert just as if I saw it but I needed only touch it and then I knew very well what it was  Oh yes said Charlotte you have given us indeed an admirable token of your courage  Needed only to touch it  And therefore I suppose you would have let me  touch  the door but that I pushed you forward  It becomes you well to talk about my fear said Lambert you that got behind poor Felix  And poor little Dorothy behind me added the sly Felix  Come said Mr Friendly I can see you have nothing to reproach each other with But Lambert's notion is not upon that account less rational for as in all the monstrous shapes that we image out continually to ourselves we have but natural accidents to fear we may ward off all danger by the sense of feeling which distinguishes what frequently deceives the sight It is the neglect of this precaution in our infancy that makes so many of us fancy ghosts in every object round about us I remember on this head a story comical enough which I will tell you  The four children now came round their father crying out a story oh a story and their father thus began it  In my father's house there lived a maidservant who one night was sent for beer into the cellar We were all seated at the table but could not set eyes upon the servant or beer My mother who was rather of a hasty temper rose from table and went out to call her As it chanced the cellardoor was open but she could not make the servant hear My mother ordered me to bring a candle and go down into the cellar with her I went first to light the way but as I looked straight forward  did not mind my steps and all at once fell over something rather soft My light went out and getting up I put my hand upon another hand quite motionless and cold Upon the cry that I uttered down came the cook maid with a candle She drew near and we discovered the poor girl stretched all along upon the ground face downward in a swoon We raised her up and let her have a smelling bottle She recovered her spirits but had hardly lifted up her eyes when she cried out There there she is there still Who is there replied my mother That tall white woman answered she there hanging in the corner See see see We looked the way that she pointed and in fact did see as she described it something white and of a tolerable length suspended in a corner Is it only  that  replied the cookmaid bursting out a laughing Why that is nothing but a leg of mutton which I bought last night I hung it there that it might be quite fresh and cool and put a napkin round it to keep off the flies She ran immediately took off the napkin and exhibited the leg of mutton to her fellowservant who stood trembling with fear It was above a quarter of an hour before she was convinced of her ridiculous mistake She would at first insist upon it that the phantom stared her in the face with saucer eyes that she had turned to run away but that the ghost had followed her fastened on her petticoat and seized upon the candle in her hand What happened after this she could not tell  It is very easy to explain all this said Mr Vernon and assign the reason why your servant fancied thus extravagantly When the fright first seized her and she swooned the circulation of the blood was stopped and she could not run away she thought she had been held Her limbs were deprived of strength so that she could not hold the candle and therefore supposed that the spectre took it from her  We are happy added he that the understanding and good tense of people has begun to dissipate these foolish notions concerning ghosts and goblins There was once at me of so much g  rance that these ideas mixed with suppositions notions and deprived the boldest of their conrage  ut thank heaven they are at length completely done away in towns though they subsist as strong as ever  in the country which is still supposed to be inhabited by witches and a train of evil spirits What I am going now to tell you is a laughable example of it  Tom Stubbs a labouring man one evening was returning from a fair with Edmund and Susan his two children It was towards the end of autumn when the day shuts in betimes  Tom going by an ale house told the children that he would enter and refresh himself a little ordering them as they were well acquainted with the road before them to go onward and in half a dozen minutes he would overtake them Edmund and Susan therefore went on slowly talking of the drollery of a puppetshow that they had been seeing and as well as they were able talking like the wooden figures in it All at once about the middle of a path which passing round the corner of a little wood came where they stood into the public road their eye was caught by something very bright that seemed to dance upon the ground or rise and fall by turns The father having formerly been a soldier had frequently told them that they must never be afraid of what by night and at a distance might assume a frightful figure but go boldly up to it when they would find it nothing Edmund had forgot all this instruction He could hardly speak he shook all over and perspired abundantly whereas his sister laughed to see him frightened saying that she would go and see the apparition nearer Edmund all in vain assured her that it was a ghost who certainly would twist her neck off She was not discouraged by these foolish notions but went onward towards the light without once stopping  She was come within a dozen yards of it when behold ye she discerned the very puppetshowman who had entertained her at the fair and who was seeking something with his lantern  For in drawing out his handkerchief his purse had followed and for upwards of ten minutes he had looked about to find it on the ground about the spot Susan who had always her wits about her went and searched the hedges and found it hanging on a sprig The  h  wman gave her as a recompence the punchinello which had made her laugh so much and as they went along instructed her how to twitch the strings and  to make it play in that diverting manner that she had lately seen  They were hardly at home when Tom came in The puppetman informed him of what had happened and extolled Susan's courage It was now extremely dark however and little Edmund was not to be seen Tom began to fear some accident and therefore took a link and with Susan ran to see if he could find him  They went very fast and hallooed as they ran by turns At last they heard a great way off the voice of some one in distress They made up to it and found Edmund in a ditch unable to get out He was quite covered with a cake of mud from head to foot and had his face and hands torn sadly with the brambles  How the deuce came you here said his father as he helped him out  Ah father I was running with my head turned towards a jackalantern that ran after me and as I could not see my way before me I tumbled in here I wanted to get out but could find only brambles to lay hold of See how they have scratched my face and hands and thereupon he began his cries and lamentations afresh  Tom reproved him very roughly for his cowardice but Edmund was a deal more vexed when told his sister's luck He could not be consoled for having lost his share in the diverting punchinello which she knew by this time how to play off with great dexterity  The lantern in your tale said Mr Fairfield makes me recollect a singular adventure with a lantern in it that performed its part so well as to affright not merely such a little peasant as your Edmund but a whole village  I was coming home one night on horseback from a visit that I had just before been making to a number of the neighbouring villages where I had quartered my recruits There had fallen a great deal of rain that day since noon and during all the evening which had broken up the road and it was raining still with equal violence but being forced to join my Company the next morning I set out provided with a lantern having to pass a narrow defile between two mountains  I had cleared it when a gust of wind took off my hat and carried it so far that I despaired of recovering it again and therefore gave the matter up By great good fortune I had on me a large scarlet cloak I covered up my head and shoulders with it leaving nothing but a little hole to see my way and breathe through and for fear the wind should take a fancy to my cloak as well as hat I passed my right arm round my body to secure it so that riding on in this position you may easily conceive that my lantern which I held in my right hand was under my left shoulder At the entrance of a village on a hill I met three travellers who no sooner saw me than they ran away as if they were possest For my part I went on upon the gallop and when come into the town alighted at an inn where I designed to rest myself a little but soon after who should enter but my three poltroons as pale as death itself They told the landlord and his people trembling as they spoke that on the road they had encountered a great figure of a man all over blood whose head was like a flame of fire and to increase the wonder placed beneath his shoulder He was mounted on a dreadful horse said they quite black before and grey behind which notwithstanding it was lame he spurred and whipped right up the mountain with extraordinary swiftness Here they ended their relation They had taken care to spread the alarm as they were flying from this wondrous apparition and the people had come with them to the inn in such a drove that upwards of a hundred were all squeezed together opening their mouths and ears at this tremendous story To make up in some sort for my dismal journey I resolved to laugh a little and be merry at their cost intending at the same time to cure them of such frights by showing them their folly in the present instance With this view I mounted my horse again behind the inn went round about till I had rode the distance of half a mile when turning I disposed of my accoutrements that is to say my clock and lantern as before and on I came upon a gallop towards the inn You should have seen the frighted mob of peasants how they hid their faces at the sight and crowded into the passage There was no one but the host that had courage to remain and keep his eye upon me I was now before the door on which I shifted the position of my lantern let my cloak  drop down upon my shoulders and appeared the same figure as he had seen me by his kitchen fire It was not without real difficulty that we could bring the simple people who had crowded in for safety from their terror the three travellers in particular as the first impression was still strong within them could not credit what they saw We finished by a hearty  ugh at their expence and drinking to the man whose head was like a flame of fire and placed beneath his shoulder This was what I meant to tell you and perhaps if such conviction of their groundless apprehensions had not been afforded them the story of my strange appearance would have passed from one old woman to another and for centuries occasioned mortal fears through all the country  It depended only on me too in the same manner said Mr Fitzwilliam to afford the subject of a fine story to the gossips of my county in an adventure that besel me one night about the time of my leaving school  I was come home at Midsummer and had received an invitation from my uncle to be with him for a month or thereabouts While I was there I had occasion to get up one night or rather morning I was obliged to pass along a gallery and had nothing but the moon to guide my steps and she was very much obscured by clouds In going by a window which opened to the garden I saw a monstrous figure moving at a little distance from the gallery where I was The moon which cast a faint light on the monster gave it an appearance rather frightful It was like a great Colossus with the upper part inclining forwards As it went away I saw it by degrees diminish All at once however it appeared to come in two One half seemed motionless and dead the other greatly agitated but as neither of the two approached me in the fear that seized me I had strength enough to bawl out help help help I had but time to utter these three words before the living half of the phantom ran up to the gallery where I was and in a suppliant accent said to me ah master Charles do not cry out for heaven's sake I remembered as I thought the voice and therefore taking courage went up boldly to it crying out who are you Some housebreaker doubtlessNo no master I am Sam the coachman Sam the coachman answered I and what are you about at such an hour as  this I followed him for he was now gone from me and perceived a sack of something placed against the wall I now saw clearly what had given him so monstrous an appearance and why he seemed to come in two when he had thrown the sack off his shoulders I demanded what the sack had in it I am going answered he betimes to town Last night I quite forgot to bring my horses their supply of oats and they must eat before they leave the stable So I rose to get it but pray do not speak a word about it in the house I beg you they might think me very careless and perhaps a thief It came into my head upon the spot that he might in fact be what he seemed afraid of being thought I had myself the night before I remembered met him with a sack of oats upon his back Besides it was not towards the stable that he was going he was very near a little door which opened at the bottom of the garden towards a lane and besides I thought two sacks of oats were more a great deal than three horses for my uncle had but three could want At breakfast I informed my uncle of this business After some examination it was found that the coachman had a false key in his possession by means of which he had at different times purloined the corn intended for the horses  Now if when the phantom had approached and called me by my name I had not overcome my first fright but run away to shun him with what terrible ideas should I have been possessed all night The idea of this monster might perhaps have accompanied me my whole life and rendered me a coward if it had not touched my brain and robbed me of my understanding  In effect this apprehension of Mr Fitzwilliam's was by no means groundless I have myself been very lately told of an unhappy incident which shows how terrible the effects of fear may be on children I will tell it you at length my little friends and I hope the story will not fail to cure you of a wish to frighten one another when it is dark if ever you give way to such a practice  Charles Pomeroy a child of great vivacity and understanding had adopted such a turn towards music that besides his daily lesson on the organ which his master came to give him every morning he would go at night upon a visit to his master who resided in the neighbourhood and there repeat it  Charles's brother Augustus was a good boy likewise but had something of a turn towards drollery and spent the time when Charles was at his book in scheming how he might play off some trick or other no ways minding who became the object of his waggery He took notice that his brother frequently came home alone and sometimes when it was dark and turned his thoughts upon a contrivance to frighten him a little He could walk in stilts One evening therefore at the time that his brother was expected home he put himself into a pair of very high ones wrapped a great white sheet about him which trailed far behind upon the ground and took a broad brimmed hat which first of all he flapped and having covered it with crape of a sufficient length to hang a great way down on every side but most of all before him put it on his head Thus frightfully equipped he placed himself upright and at a little distance from the house close by the gardengate through which his brother always entered coming home This last was now returning in the innocent delight peculiar to a child and humming to himself the tune that he had been playing He was scarce come within a dozen paces of the gate when he perceived the vast Colossus which held out its arms advancing to attack him Agitated with a mortal fright at such an apparition he fell down upon the ground deprived of understanding Poor Augustus who had not foreseen the consequences of his fatal frolic threw away his mask immediately and fell upon his brother's almost breathless body and did everything in his power to reanimate him but alas the unhappy little fellow as he found was every thing but absolutely dead His parents instantly came running to the spot and with a great deal of difficulty brought him back to life He opened his eyes and viewed them with a vacant stupid look They called him by every tender name but he appeared as if he did not comprehend them He endeavoured but in vain to speak his tongue essayed to do so but without articulation He is now deaf dumb and foolish and will very probably remain so all his lifetime Six or seven months have passed since this deplorable occurrence and the doctors who attend him have as yet done nothing towards his cure Imagine little friends if you are able the distress and sorrow of his parents It would certainly  have been better both for them and him too had he died upon the spot They would not then have every day before them such a piteous object of affliction and despair But their distress is nothing in comparison to Augustus's Since the unhappy accident he has been like a skeleton much more than a human creature He can neither eat nor sleep His tears exhaust him Twenty times a day he walks about the room and suddenly stops short he wrings his hands pulls up his hair and curses even his birth He calls and embraces his dear brother who no longer knows him I have seen them both and cannot tell which of the two is most unhappy  BACKGAMMON  MR Parker had been buying for his children Anthony and Sylvia what they call a draftboard and backgammon table at the back with thirty men two red Morocco boxes and a pair of dice  The children did not know as yet both games they were a little skilled in drafts but then backgammon was all Greek or Hebrew to them so they begged their dear papa to give them some instruction in it Mr Parker who was always ready to make one in their diversions undertook the task with pleasure and by turns sat down with both while he that was not in the game looked on for improvement  I shall not detain you with describing how they reckoned up the pips upon the dice when they had thrown them by the assistance of their fingers or the blunders that they were every minute making I chuse rather to inform you that in little better than a month they understood backgammon tolerably well and could sit down and play with one another Sylvia bent her study to secure the hit but Anthony much more ambitious would be satisfied with nothing but the gammon  Their papa one day stood by while they were playingAfter some bad throws Anthony lost all temper and his moves of course were very injudicious but his  sister who was calm and steady carried every thing before her  Anthony like other players while he shook the dicebox did not fall to name the points that he wanted either to fill up his table or defeat his adversary  Cinq  and  quatre  dried ne  Size  and  trey  but no they would not come and it was always deuce and ace or double treys or something to the full as bad that turned up in their stead He stamped upon the ground or when he threw the dice was so outrageous as to fling the dicebox after crying out Was ever any thing so crossgrained and unlucky one would think the matter were contrived to spite me  Sylvia on the other hand when she in throwing called for such a number as she wanted and was disappointed far from giving way to useless lamentation thought within herself what  move  would be the most judicious after her bad throw and frequently her father was surprised to see how she would make amends for want of luck and in an instant as it were recover when he thought her on the point of being worsted  And whenever victory declared for her with all the honours of a triumph she would constantly and modestly avoid the glory of her conquest while poor Anthony ashamed of being beaten durst not lift his eyes up Upon one of these occasions when his father had been standing by and noticed his bad playing he addressed him to the following purport Anthony you have richly merited to lose this game  Anthony  And not this only but the others I acknowledge for my fault in playing with a person that is constantly so lucky  Mr Parker  It would seem then to hear you talk that luck is every thing at such a game as this  Anthony  No papa but when one has such throws as  Mr Parker  It was scarcely possible that your throws should benefit you when you played your men so injudiciously and Sylvia with so much attention but you talk of having had such throws and there your fault lies for you paid attention to your sister's dice instead of noticing her men that you might learn to move as she did What would be your notions of a gardener who without consulting the variety of seasons should conduct himself by  chance in his plantation and complain that in the end his fruit was not so good or plentiful as his neighbour's who had been attentive to all circumstances in the prosecution of his labour  Anthony  O papa that is very different  Mr Parker  And in what pray let me know  Anthony  I cannot well answer you in that I think it so however  Mr Parker  I am ashamed on your account to see you have recourse to such poor shifts as little minds employ when they resolve before hand to support their cause for tell me have you really discerned in my comparison any thing that hinders it from having a relation to the subject of which we are speaking  Anthony  To say the truth then no I did not once think of it I was only anxious to avoid the appearances of being worsted in the argument  Mr Parker  You may see then what you get by such evasions You were only to be blamed for wanting judgment and you added instantly thereto what is much more to be condemned a want of justice By using such a pitiful subterfuge against an adversary of common sense do you think that he will become its dupe and yield you up the conquest Never He will see the folly of it first and afterwards the meanness You will find you might have been entitled to his pity but will meet with his contempt and not  his  only but your own  Anthony  I hope papa I have not made you angry that you speak so to me  Mr Parker  You are sensible that I never spare reproof when I see any thing that leads however roundabout to meanness or injustice Such a lesson you will get from no one but your father and I give it you from motives of affection that another may not have occasion to bestow it on you from moroseness The confession which you first made me of not having once considered what you spoke and which only could proceed from an ingenuous turn of mind persuades me that you will never want another lesson of the kindEmbrace me my dear fellow  Anthony  Oh with all my heart I know papa you save me many mortifying minutes  Mr Parker  I can hit upon no other way of doing so than this of giving you instruction but at present let us  come to the comparison that I instanced and I hope we shall be no less able to derive improvement from it than illustrate what we were speaking of before  Anthony  Let us see then papa I promise I will not seek to contradict you but provided I observe it vary in the least from what you meant it to explain you give me leave in that case  Mr Parker  I desire no gentler treatment I shall be rejoiced to have you give me juster notions for believe me when I tell you that a rational selflove finds satisfaction even in confessing its mistakes Selflove if rational has always an unfeigned respect for truth a veneration for reciprocal or mutual justice and that reason which can spring thus nobly from its fall is in the way of never stumbling  Anthony  Ah papa I see I must this long while keep a tight rein on mine  Mr Parker  You must but loosen  that  at least of your imagination so that you may follow while I show the way I told you that a player at backgammon should pursue the conduct of a skilful gardener in his garden If the one endeavours to procure his tree a handsome looking trunk and make such disposition of the branches as may get him the most frait the other is employed in bringing up his men in such a manner that whatever points he throws he may be able to fill up his tables more or less Those points depend no more upon the one than the variety of seasons on the other but what equally depends on both is this that they should be upon their guard in consequence of these uncertainties and not expose the object for which they are labouring without precaution on their part The order of a game has many favourable and unfavourable turns as has the order of the seasons many beneficial and malignant influences Now the lucky chances I may say have a resemblance to those kindly heats which introduce fertility and the unlucky to those nipping winds in summer that are obstacles to vegetation The great point is to foresee these changes He that plays is with discretion to run some few risques when nothing need be feared from his adversary but to stand upon his guard whenever he is in force and he that plants is to expose his tree that it may have the beneficial influence of the sun when all the elements are mixed in  kindly union but to defend it when the weather happens to grow stormy  Anthony  Very well papa things hitherto square marvellously well but at backgammon a good player you are sensible not only profits by his own dexterity but is the better for his adversary's want of judgment and the faults that he makes whereas the gardener if he plays a game must play it by himself in your comparison  Mr Parker  True Anthony but you must not expect that a comparison will take in every object and relation mine is limited to those I have mentioned  Anthony  Do you think so Well then I will proceed a little further with it if you please papa I look on all the gardeners of the village as if playing with each other to determine which shall bring the best and greatest quantity of fruit to market He that plays most skilfully will do so and of course dispose of it at higher prices if the rest through ignorance and inattention shall have less or worse to sell and consequently he will win the game  Mr Parker  Well argued Anthony You now see I hope what advantages one may derive from entering into rational debate where neither party seeks to lay a snare to catch the other and to satisfy his miserable vanity but where both wish to give reciprocal instruction by an interchange of what they know respectively I only saw one face belonging to the object which I exhibited to your consideration but exciting your attention towards it I have furnished you with the occasion of discovering one that had escaped me and which very likely may enable me in my turn to discern some other that it may still possess Men have obtained no sort of knowledge otherwise than by assembling and comparing those ideas with which meditation has supplied them in cultivating any branch of science I compare them to as many lamps that should be placed to burn before reflectors of a thousand different surfaces but every one reverberating to a common center It is the bundle of these rays some far more brilliant than the rest indeed but strengthened all by one another that makes up that glare of light collected in the focus of their union I shall really be glad if you inure yourself betimes Anthony to consider all the objects of which you would judge by comparing them with others that already are familiar to your understanding by contrasing them with  one another and remarking in this contrast every circumstance by which they may resemble or be foreign to each other This same method is most natural and sure It is a method which  they  have followed who by exercising their imagination have attained to the sublimity and pathos of a Homer a Voltaire a Milton who by studying the affections of the human heart have made themselves a Sophocles a Moliere or a Shakespeare who by rising to the origin of our ideas have become a Condillac or Locke who by investigating nature have acquired the praises of an Aristotle a Buffon an Edwards who by mecitating on the title to give law and form  have been a Montesquieu a Mably a Rousseau a Blackstone and in short who by pervading the mysterious  of the planetary system have transmitted to us together with the benefit of their researches the illustrious names of a Copernicus a Kepler a Bernouilli and a  but perticularly of a Newton men all famous in the  fferent sciences to which their genius led them and whose names I  utimate thus early to you that in time you may be  imated with a wish of studying the immortal  which they have left behind them  INNOCENCE MADE MANIFEST  PART I  LEAVE we the degenerate crew  Who at female virtue rail  to your wives be true  And your peace can never fail  For faise rumours should your wrath  Arm itself against their life  Those who urge their breach of troth  With their virtue are at strife  Ancient story proves this truth  Now the subject of my song  it is by speaking sooth  To acquit the  of wrong  Yet what pleasure can this give  If my heart no other feel  Wives if you but happy live  I'm rewarded for my zeal  Beauteous in her prime of days  Brabant's daughter meek and mild  Blanch attracted gen'ral praise  Gentle as a newborn child  Twenty barons for her strove  Siffroi only gain'd the prize  Hymen quickly crown'd his love  With indissoluble ties  But tho' wedded still they seem'd  Nymph and lover as before  In their countenances beam'd  Smiles of love a countless store  Tender cares the speaking eye  Ev'n the faithful turtle dove  Had she flown their dwelling nigh  Might have learnt from them to love  But sad tidings soon he hears  Farewel all his love's delight  Saladin in arms appears  Siffroi must go join the fight  Many a wound within his heart  Love and Fame contending make  Fame is sweetbut then to part  Robb'd of Blanch his heart must break  Up at early dawn he hies  Grief his manly cheek o'erflows  While he views her as she lies  Wrapt in undisturb'd repose  But the more his wish inclin'd  With her charms to feast his view  Ev'n the more he dreads to find  Danger in the soft adieu  Going he returns but Fame  Loudly chiding from afar  Mounts his steed and urg'd by shame  Rushes to the field of war  Blanch awakes what pain to prove  Widow'd when so newly wed  Oh what anguish wounds her love  When she finds her Siffroi fled  Siffroi's seneschal who burn'd  Long a captive to her charms  Hasting ere his lord return'd  Basely tempts her to his arms  Blanch his daring hope reprov'd  Less severely than she ought  Wherefore he by fury mov'd  Thus his impious vengeance wrought  Less at length a prey to care  Blanch this news to Siffroi sent  In my swelling womb I bear  What will both our loves content  No writes he my injur'd lord  Blanch deludes your ardent vows  Read these letters they afford  Proofs how she can treat her spouse  No one pang bad Siffroi known  'Reft of all his rich demain  Blanch's cheerless state alone  Would have cost his bosom pain  But that thus the perjur'd fair  Should his love and name disgrace  'Tis too much he cries to bear  Vengeance must of love take place  In his mind's first wr  thful plight  No calm  he'll allow  Death should  thinks requite  Those who break the marriage vow  He resolves but a  his heart  Shock'd at Blanch's dreadful fate  Countermands the murdering part  Wretched Siffroi 'tis too late  PART II  Soon as the first mandate came  On dire thoughts of blood intent  Moves th' assassin to his aim  Fearing Siffroi may relent  Blanch had with a son it seems  After nine long months been blest  Weak defence against the schemes  Cherish'd in a villain's breast  To two thieves a hellish pair  This vile murder is assign'd  To the forest Blanch they bear  Wife nor child must pity find  Would you friends she said and knel  t  Prove more cruel than needs must  If compassion e'er you felt  Spare my child or kill me first  Innocence how strong thy charm  Of this murderous pair so fierce  One though lifted is his arm  Wants a heart the wife to pierce  Piteous breast and flowing eyes  Wherefore do ye thus relent  I can't strike the vi  lain cries  Here then let your life be spent  Blanch with fear and fright half dead  Hastens to take up her child  And all trem  ng as she sled  Traverses the pathless wild  In the transports of her joy  How she clasps him to her heart  Tracting in th' unhappy boy  Siffroi still her soul's best part  Soon comes sharp inquietude  These vain transports to ensue  In a place so wild and rude  Hapless pair what will you do  Day descends Blanch wanders long  Nothing knowing where to go  While oh grief her pangs so strong  Stop her milk's late plenteous flow  How shall I describe her fears  Her unutterable smart  While the feeds the babe with tears  Warm'd by pressure to her heart  If he  she feels his pain  Pierce her tencer bosom through  If he ceases to complain  Thinks him dead and mourns anew  Night comes onto grief resign'd  She awaits returning day  Then she wanders forth to find  Fruit her hunger to alla    Hasting I ask she seen with joy  Wond'rous sight a gentle  ee  Kindly to the famish'd boy  Nourishment and milk bestow  God who all we need canst give  Mothers are thy work alone  Hoping now the child may live  Grief she feels not of her own  To a cave not far from thence  Now the doe her guest precedes  Points her future relidence  And with care the infant feeds  Thus thought Blanch 'twould be her fate  Life's whole course to pass away  In a solitary state  Known by none but beasts of prey  U  ripe fruits her only food  Nothing but dry leaves her bed  Winds that sweep the solitude  Pierce her wild and dreary shed  Dreams of soft ring hope at least  Grant the succour you can give  Famine God can turn to feast  Therefore Blanch in patience live  If he smites us he's our sire  And his children he holds dear  Comfort then his darting fire  Wickedness alone needs fear  PART III  Than the seneschal not less  Thinking Blanch among the dead  Siffroi feels the keen distress  By a troubled conscience bred  If he drives her from his mind  Thither she returns again  Often too his heart's inclin'd  To suppose her free from stain  Torn with anguish tir'd of breath  He would gladly die in sight  But stern Fate will not by death  Terminate his wretched plight  Spent with weariness one day  By the foe was Siffroi ta'en  Sev'n long years in bonds he lay  And when free repass'd the main  He arrives o'erwhelm'd with grief  Ev'n his native plains so gay  Can afford him no relief  Nor his bitter pangs allay  Tasteless seems the festive bowl  Dull the pomp of courtly show  Siffroi for thy tortur'd soul  Fate reserves another blow  Verging now to life's last goal  Does the seneschal repent  And behind him leaves a scroll  Proving Blanch was innocent  Oh what horror Sissroi then  Felt when he beheld and read  Blanch through me he cries of men  Guiltiest has unjustly bled  Thenceforth does a haggard fiend  Stalk where'er he turns his sight  On his path by day attend  And disturb his sleep by night  Blanch he sees in fan'ral shroud  With her babe go glaring by  Fierce they frown and yelling loud  Cruel spouse and father cry  Wine and pleasure both in vain  Minister their soothing balm  Respite he finds none from pain  Thoss'd by tempest without calm  Most however he's inclin'd  To pursue the stag's swift pace  Least distracted when his mind  Meets the turmoil of the chace  One day as it chanc'd his dart  Pierc'd a deerthe creature fled  He pursues her steps in part  Guided by the blood she shed  But while traversing the wild  What strange objects soon appear  Lo a female and a child  Comforting the wounded deer  On this female form half bare  Scarcely had he turn'd his view  Than she redden'd and her hair  Instantly before her threw  From the world cry'd Siffroi torn  With this child what do you here  Sev'n long years said Blanch I mourn  One though cruel still most dear  Cruel Siffroi cried and why  By a villain's arts said she  Was his ear deceiv'd and I  An adult'ress thought to be  What then are youbut proceed  Blanch I was when fortune smil'd  Siffroi springing off his steed  Cries aloud My wife and child  Yes 'tis you with joy intense  He repeats and many a kiss  Oh I know your innocence  But believ'd you dead ere this  Cruel as I was dear wife  To reduce you to this state  No said Blanch you give me life  If you own my truth though late  But by this time round about  Crowding his companions throng  See your mistress he cries out  She for whom we griev'd so long  See my son too of his face  Ev'ry feature calls him so  Come and from this dreary place  To my palace let us go  On the train proceeds and near  Follow the now happy pair  Close to them the gentle deer  Proud the playful child to bear  Family thrice fortunate  All your sufferings now are o'er  Now at length you prove a fate  Happier than you knew before  THE AFFECTIONATE MOTHER  LETTER I  To Mrs Torrington  MADAM  THIS address perhaps will cause you some surprize or possibly you may have looked for such a greetingI for my part find it necessary and of course without another line of preface I pass over to the subject which extorts this letter from me  You may well remember there was once a time when Ifi  ncerely loved you and when you yourself appeared to merit my affection Now that time is past You have found out an object worthier of your love than I am Since you act from the idea of promoting your felicity by such a preference I do not wish to thwart youWe are freeDo you retire where you think fit while I live where I please and that is here I grant you a week's time to make your choice I go away tomorrow morning and shall stay from home till Monday next that you may not be incommoded with my presence or endure that trouble of which it does not suit me in the least to be a witness Respecting our three children you may be at peace on their account Their mother after her behaviour must no longer have the least communication with them and whenever I think fit to make enquiry I shall find some governess who will not be wholly unqualified to bring them up according to their birth Receive for ever my adieu Enjoy in peace your new condition and endeavour as much as you can to blot out the remembrance of that man who formerly was proud to subscribe himself your loving husband but is now no more than c  ARTHUR TORRINGTON  LETTER II  To Mr Torrington  SIR  I Should in vain endeavour to describe the different emotions raised within my soul by the perusal of your letter You resolve that a separation shall take place between us Since you judge an open rupture needful I submit to your good pleasure If when we were first united any one had told me that all our mutual vows would come to this I should certainly not have been persuaded that such an event was possible Nevertheless it has taken place In my misfortunes however I have still one consolation left me namely that in heaven there is a God who has the means of manifesting innocence My conscience clears me of reproach My heart has no idea of an object worthier of me as you say than you are It has always been devoted to you only I protest all this not making use of oaths but by a simple affirmation which my heart pronounces with assurance I will make no effort to convince you of my innocence and your injustice I shall patiently pursue the path which God's providence points out for me God's providence I say which hitherto has heaped its blessings on me and I hope will still continue so to do It is a cruel step sir to take all my children from me I may think the mother who first gave them life in anguish has a greater title to them than a father and the laws would grant me the society of one at least but do not imagine that I have such a doubt of your paternal tenderness and wish to make them happy as to have recourse to legal aid against you I will figure to myself with resignation that God's will by death has torn them from me or that I myself am dead and shall be very quickly followed by them Farewel and be at all times happy most unjust yet dearest husband Every night and morning I will pray to God that for your own repose he may remove the mist of error from before  your eyes convincing you how faithful and affectionate a spouse you are at present wronging in the person of your desolate  AMELIA TORRINGTON  SCENE I  Mrs Torrington Harriet Sophia Caroline  Harriet  Here we are mama  Mrs Torrington  Come hither my dear children Sir down by me I have something to tell you  Caroline  Take me on your knee do pray mama  Mrs Torrington takes up Caroline kisses her and weeps  Harriet  What is the matter dear mama why do you cry  Sophia  I have done nothing at least that I know of to displease you  Caroline  Nor I either dear mama  The Children  while their mother cannot speak for tears  Mama dear dear mama  Mrs Torrington  restraining her tears  Do not be uneasy my sweet children I beseech you Do not cry thus or you will certainly distract me  Harriet  Then why did you cry yourself first of all Why did you weep so yesterday the day before and every day since you received my papa's last letter  Mrs Torrington  Do not ask me my poor girl You will know all time enough All that I can tell you at present my dear children is that I am forced to leave you tomorrow morning early  Sophia  And do not you intend then to take me this time as I was promised Harriet you remember went with you last year  Mrs Torrington  I wish I could my life and not you only but your sisters likewise but it is not in my power  Harriet  At least mama I hope you mean to return very soon  Sophia  And won't you bring me something pretty  Caroline  And me too  Harriet  What sisters can you see how sad mama is and yet think of asking her for playthingsIf I durst  Mrs Torrington  Well what my dearest Harriet  Harriet  bursling into tears  You will never come back to us I know it You are always sorrowful when you quit us but yet you never wept so much as now when you were going on a little journey  Mrs Torrington  Do not alarm yourself Harriet In about six weeks I shall come back and see you  Sophia  In about six weeks and what are we to do so long without you  Caroline  I can never play so well you know mama as when you are with me  Mrs Torrington  Your papa will come back next Monday  Harriet  And not find you here then to receive him  Sophia  He will be very sorry when he comes to find you absent  Caroline  So pray stay at least till he comes back  Mrs Torrington  It will but give him greater pleasure at the time of my return to see me and six weeks will soon be past  Harriet  You won't inform us but I know very well that papa  Mrs Torrington  Dear child you wound my heart and I have grieved enough already at the thought of parting with you Pray be comforted We shall see one another again very soon Receive this kiss as an assurance  Harrict  clinging round her neck  Oh if it were true  Mrs Torrington  When six weeks are once past you will see I promise you and you know I never yet deceived you Take care of your health dear babes and study to amuse yourselves till I return  She embraces them one after the other  Harriet and Sophia you that are the eldest take what care you can that nothing happens to poor little Caroline Think frequently of me and I on my part will do so of you Farewel farewel  She forces herself from them and goes out while they stand motionless with grief and cry bitterly  LETTER III  To Mrs Villars  Dear and Worthy FRIEND  I Send you my three girls and earnestly conjure you to bestow your tenderest care upon them so that they may find a second mother in you After the deplorable event that has deprived them of the mother who first gave them life I look upon it as a special blessing that your ladyship so generously condescends to superintend their education I am sensible how great a burthen I wish you to undertake and how utterly unabled shall ever be to shew my gratitude for such a favour But then what will not a father dare to do for his children Condescend therefore my dearest Madam upon that account to pardon my paternal indiscretion and dispose for ever both of me and every thing belonging to me There is one particular that I cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention namely the selection of a proper governess Endeavour to secure them one according to your principles and mine There are so few Madam fit for any thing but dressing and undressing dolls and rather than deliver up my children to such creatures I would leave them in a wilderness to vegetate without receiving any education But as souls that afterwards prove worthy of each other have a sort of reciprocal attraction by a secret sympathy subsisting in them I am not without the hope that in so elegant a place as Bath you will at least be able to procure some woman of a suitable behaviour with sense sufficient and knowledge to bring up my children as I wish I beg that you would suppose yourself at liberty to enter into any terms with such a one as you yourself think proper since I mean to spare no cost upon a point of such importance I am quite impatient for a letter from you It would highly please me if your ladyship would charge my eldest daughter Harriet with some part of the correspondence that will be between us as by such means she will come herself to write correctly betimes and to express herself with some degree of ease It is in  your power to render more supportable the great misfortune that I have undergone and to give me in my children all the joy of which their mother has deprived me In reality I cherish such a hope within me to drive out the uneasiness that otherwise would overwhelm me and subscribe myself with every sentiment of gratitude esteem and friendship  Yours c ARTHUR TORRINGTON  SCENE II  Mrs Torrington Jenny the maid and Crape her footman  Crape  entering  Here is my lady Harbord's answer madam to your letter with her compliments  Mrs Torrington  That is well Is Benjamin in the house Bid him come up and come you with him likewise  Mrs Torrington  having read the letter  Thank HeavenI have succeeded  To her maid  Hold Jenny it is meant for you  Jenny  reading  "I am quite happy madam to receive the chambermaid that you recommend me One of whom you speak so very handsomely must be a valuable servant and I thank you for the preference that you have afforded me on this occasion She may come whenever she thinks fit"  giving back the letter with a trembling hand  Alas my dearest mistress what have I done then that you are sending me away In what have I deserved dismission  Mrs Torrington  You have not deserved it my poor Jenny You have at all times been a dutiful girl and if hereafter Providence should otherwise dispose my lot I will have none but you to wait upon me But at present it is impossible that you should continue with me any longer We must absolutely part Be comforted it will not I persuade myself be long before I have you back I would till then have given you wherewithal to live but that I fear the danger that might threaten your  youth and inexperience You will be with Lady Harbord no less happy than you were with me as I have recommended you to her protection in a very earnest manner Take this little present as a token of remembrance there is likewise in the bottom drawer of my bureau a quantity of clothes and linen which I give you Go my poor dear Jeany and do not cry before me thus My eyes are full enough of tears already Go and when you have put all your things together I will see you once more  Jenny  wringing her hands  And must I quit you then my dearest lady No I cannot live without you I will follow you wherever you are going  Mrs Torrington  with firmneys  Let me beg dear Jenny if you love me not to here my mind at present with your lamentations leave me to myself I want to be alone Go go my poor dear friend I have already mentioned that I would see you once again before we part  Jenny  going out  My worthiest mistress  Mrs Torrington Benjamin her coachman Crape the foorman  Benjamin  Do you want me madam Are you going out this morning  Mrs Torrington  Wait a little Benjamin  to Crape  Crape how much may be coming to you  Crape  Only for a quarter madam  Mrs Torrington  There it is besides a half year more that you may have a trifle for your subsistance till you find another p  ace as my  lige me to leave home I have been  ased with your behaviour in my service and drawn up this  which you may shew wherever you apply for  ment You are young and know your business  will easily procure a place Parewel and God he with you  The footman quits the room with sorrow in his conten  nce  Benjamin  Ah my good dear lady I would fain believe that my turn is not coming  Mrs Torrington  It is with great reluctance I inform you that we must part  Benjamin  What I leave you madam I that saw you almost as soon as you were born and followed you when you were married from your father's I whom you considered as a part of your dowry and declared that you did so will you send me off when I have been so many years your servant Do you think me less attached to you at present on account of my age than I was formerly Alas I have no wife or child I have no friend but you my dearest mistress what will become of me then if I must now be parted from you  Mrs Torrington  Benjamin you may easily believe me when I tell you that this parting cannot but afflict me But you see I have dismissed my maid and footman and you may judge I cannot have occasion for a coachman  Benjamin  Cannot have occasion Are my master's affairs in confusion then I have wherewithal to feed your horses many years to come your bounty gave it me Pray then let me die in my seat and still continue with you  Mrs Torrington  Such a proof of your attachment cannot but affect me and I feel it at my heart but be you comforted Your master manages his fortune as a man of prudence should do and his wife is not in want of any thing in proof of which I give you my three horses and a trifle every year for your support  Benjamin  What me so much my dear mistress What use can I make of your bounty I should but die the sooner after I had it out of grief for having lost the worthy giver of it Never therefore never  Mrs Torrington  I insist on your acceptance of it for my own though not your satisfaction I would willingly be happy in the thought of having given you peace and comfort for the rest of your old age Go then my friend you will distress me should you stay a minute longer  Benjamin  Let me wish you then at least a th  usand blessings I am old yet were I younger should not have sufficient time to weep for having lost you  Mrs Villars Mrs Torrington under the feigned name of Lambert and in aisguise  Mrs Torrington  Pardon me madam the liberty of this intrusion I have been informed that you want a governess for three young ladies Though I am far from thinking that I have all the necessary qualifications for such an arduous undertaking yet my situation induces me to beg that you would have so much goodness as to make a trial of me  Mrs Villars  May I ask you madam who you are and what your name is  Mrs Torrington  Lambert madam I am the unhappy widow of a man whom I loved and still love better than myself In the affliction that besets me I should look upon it as a consolation could I fill my time up with the education of your little ladies I conjure you madam to bestow this favour on me if you have not yet engaged with any one I dare persuade myself you will be satisfied with my solicitude to please you I desire no salary I am above the possibility of want It is only an employment that I request to drive away the thought of my misfortunes  Mrs Villars  So affecting is your motive that it interests me in your favour You have then no children madam  Mrs Torrington  with emotion  I had three that constituted all my hope and satisfaction but alas my cruel fortune has deprived me of them  Mrs Villars  I sincerely pity you with all my heart You seem a very tender mother and deserve that they should have lived to recompense your feeling and affection  Mrs Torrington  with a sigh  Ah madam they are still still living But on that account however strange my story not less lost to me  She weeps  Mrs Villars  I cannot comprehend you madam either your affliction has impaired your understanding or you stifle in your heart some very great misfortune Would you fear to trust me with it Possibly I might be able to afford you some degree of consolation  Mrs Torrington  Yes madam you only can afford me consolation  Mrs Villars  What I only Let me know then what I can do for you There is nothing that I would not with chearfulness perform to comfort you  Mrs Torrington  Then make me governess of your young ladies  Mrs Villars  Is that all  Mrs Torrington  I can have nothing else to ask but what I ask will make me happy if you grant it  Mrs Villars  I cannot express my astonishment at what you say All this conversation is in some sort like a vision Though you do not think me worthy of your considence I feel within me a desire to give you mine I will bring you in the three young ladies Will you undergo a slight examination of your abilities to discharge the employment that you solicit If as I have not a doubt you justify the idea that I have formed concerning them I promise to intrust you with their education  Mrs Torrington  in transport  O my noble benefactress I cannot contain my joy then I have your promise  Mrs Villars  Yes madam but on such conditions as I mentioned  Mrs Torrington  Madam I desire no better and thank Heaven and you I have again recovered my three children  Mrs Villars  Your  three children madam What three children  Mrs Torrington  Those that you have undertaken to protect the three Miss Torringtons You see before you their unhappy but yet guiltless mother whom her spouse has parted from them I have left my property behind me and disguised my name and circumstances to procure an introduction to my children I was fearful of discovering who I was till I had obtained your promise I am sensible my spouse has written to you about something which he imagines I have done amiss but yet I dare persuade myself my present conduct has already proved how innocent I must be of his accusation A good mother cannot surely be a wicked wife  Mrs Villars  embracing her  O most affectionate but yet courageous woman I want words to shew my joy and  admiration Could it possibly have come into my head that Mrs Torrington was hid beneath this sorrowful disguise  Mrs Torrington  The metamorphosis has not been painful to me and in future I am seriously determined to support it No one in the world madam except you shall ever be acquainted who I am Conside upon my promise By whatever you yourself conceive most sacred will I swear that not a word shall ever escape me to reveal the secret  Mrs Villers  And on my part too I promise you the same discretion But your daughters  Mrs Torrington  I shall find it a hard task indeed to keep myself a stranger as it were to them and so suppress the workings of my motherly affection But no other way is left me Only aid me while I personate my part As soon as the deception is established once it will support itself I should be quite without anxiety on that  ead if it were not for my eldest daughter Harriet She I am afraid will know me I must persevere however in the plou imposition  Mrs Villars  I can bear no longer this affecting scene but will be gone and bring you in the children  She goes out and almost instantly return with Harriet and her  s who all make a  to Mrs Torrington considering her from head to feet with great attention and embarr  ment  Mrs Villars  My dear little ladies it is to let you see this gent  ewoman whom I have chosen to be with you as your governess I dare engage you will be happy under her I think I may assure you of her care and friendship and expect that you on your part will obey and love her just as if you thought her your mama  Harriet  falling into her arms  It is our mama it is she herself  Sophia and Carcline  Mama mama You are returned then  They all  ing to her with repeated kisses but she keept up  r served and serious countenance  Mrs Villars  Truly I was thinking that you wou'd all be  deceived I had myself the same idea of the lady I sancied I know not for what reason that she was your maina  Harriet  And so she is my heart informs me so as truly as my eyes  Sophia  And have you brought me any thing  Caroline  Ay where is the doll that you promised me mama Pray let me have it  Mrs Torrington  My dear little ladies I am sorry to see you all in such an error I am not your mother You know she is a great way off  Harriet  No not you are our dear mama We cannot be deceived You have not such a charming dress on as she wears but then you have her face and her shape and her sweet voice  Mrs Torrington  Is it possible that I should resemble your mama so much If so I am very glad on your account as well as my own it will make us so much better friends to one another will it not young ladies I dare say you begin to love me a little already don't you  Sophia  O much much mama  Caroline  And I too If you did but know  Harriet  weeping  What have we done mama that you should grieve us thus that you should tell us you are not our mother but however we are all of us your children  Mrs Villars  Come good madam you must be what they would have you and since they resolve to call you mother take that name upon you it will give them pleasure And young ladies if you like it you may call  me  mother likewise  Harriet  We do not wish to affront you but though you love us you will never be our mother  Mrs Torrington  Well my dear young ladies if you with to make me your mama I wish it likewise and will have as much affection for you as if really I were so My dear Harriet and my dear Sophia and my dear sweet little Caroline  She embraces them with transport  Harriet  How happy we all are in having our mama again We thought continually of you in your absence and did hardly any thing but cry since you first left us  Mrs Torrington  whispering Mrs Villars  I foresaw that Harriet would discover me and therefore I must make her of my party by discovering my intention to  her Then take away her sisters for a moment if you can  Mrs Villars  whispering Mrs Torrington  Yes I understand you  To Sophia and Caroline  Come my little angels I will let you have the playthings that your mama as you would have her called has brought you  She goes out with Sophia and Caroline  Mrs Torrington Harriet  Mrs Torrington  We are now alone my dear Harriet I may indulge the happiness that I feel in pressing you to my heart  Harriet  falling into her arms  Ah now you are my good mama indeed But pray never for the future tell us that you are not  Mrs Torrington  Be it so my dearest Harriet but there is one thing that I insist on in my turn  Harriet  Oh any thing in the world mama  Mrs Torrington  Then if you love me Harriet do not tell any one that I am your mother Call me only Mrs Lambert you understand It is of the greatest consequence to my affairs and for a reason which I have not time to tell you now it is necessary that I should be unknown  Harriet  How would you have me cease to call you my mama you that I love so much  Mrs Torrington  And do you think that my love considers it less painful to deny myself the only name which can at all times make me happy  Harriet  Well then I obey but every time that it comes not from my lips when I am speaking to you suppose me to pronounce it in my heart  LETTER IV  To Mr Torrington  Dear papa  I HAVE so many things to write to you that I cannot tell with which I should begin my letter We are now no longer at Mrs Villars's but have removed to Mrs Lambert  our governess's house it is in the Circus and a very pleasant situation You cannot possibly conceive how happy we are all of us in being with her She is such a charming woman quite as kind as our mama She loves us just as if we were her children and we love her also just as if she were our mother There is no need of laying out your money to have masters come and teach us she herself knows every thing that we ought to learn You would imagine that she considered it her happiness to teach us and she does it in so kind a way that we are all delighted with instruction at her hands Sophia and little Caroline already read quite charmingly so much attention Mrs Lambert has paid them As for me I have begun a course of geography and history with her this together with a little cyphering and a few choice pieces both in verse and prose which I take care to learn by heart employs our morning In the afternoon for recreation sake I go to drawing dancing and the harpsicord and when the evening comes sit down and take my needle at the use of which you cannot imagine how clever Mrs Lambert is and lastly to complete myself in cyphering and acquire a little knowledge of the expences of a house she gives me all the bills to overlook and makes me set down every little sum of money that she lays out By these means I begin to know the price of many things and as she tells me may become your little stewardess when I return With so much on my hands to do all day you will perhaps imagine that I am tired at night not at all papa I am happy on the contrary to think that I have so well filled up my time and should have reason to complain if any one deprived me of such charming occupations  I have put a little trick on Mrs Lambert and mean to tell you what it is She went the other day with Caroline to visit Mrs Villars and left me at home to keep Sophia company I thought it would divert her if I read a little so I took a book that we have called the Theatre of Education from the French and read the  Poor Blind Woman  I could not refrain from crying very much but to my great surprise Sophia did not This quite vexed me as you may easily imagine upon which I pinched her that she might cry and keep me company She cried indeed and more a great deal than I wanted  her to do At last however I appeased her after many kisses and caresses but was angry with myself for having hurt her I suppose some object took off her attention while I read and naturally thought that she would be really affected could she read the piece herself with this idea in my head I formed a plan of putting her to con this charming piece in private till she could read it perfectly and Mrs Lambert could not refrain last night from wondering at the progress that she had made We did not let her know our secret but propose to catch her so again with Caroline I am quite rejoiced that we can have these opportunities of pleasing her for all the trouble that she is every moment taking upon our account  These dear papa are our amusements and our studies here to which if you add our walks about the place our visits to a few poor people near us whom we now and then assist with old clothes and money and our labours in a little garden where we tend our flowers you will have the history of our times at large We never were so well in health as now and never in our lives so happy we want nothing but the pleasure of your company If you would only take a little journey down to Bath I would give every thing in the world that you might see this Mrs Lambert I am sure no woman breathing would prove worthier of your friendship Oh come come papa  But you must know I have Caroline at present at my elbow and she asks me if I am writing to you She is so proud of having scrawled these few days past what she calls letters in a copybook that Mrs Lambert has made her that she says she too will scribble you a line or two It will be a charming hodgepodge I foresee of great and little letters and fine spelling if she sets about it but no matter I must please her She has got a pen in hand already and is groping in the standish for ink She is tugging me this very moment by the apron to leave off and give her up my seat Adieu then dear papa My governess desires me to present you her respects Sophia's duty to you and mine also I am c  Harriet Torrington  LETTER V  To Mr Torrington  Sir  YOU certainly remember what you have often said you would submit to if a woman could be found completely fit to undertake the education of a child except it were her mother I have met with one whose qualities are even greater than your wishes for the education of your children and with justice I might claim the full performance of your promise and expect that you should set out for Rome upon your head However lay aside your fears I will not abuse my power but shew you no less mercy than the confidence that you have reposed in me I claim one sole condition of you or request rather as a friend and that is to come down as loon as possibly you can Do not ask what reason I can have for this abrupt request as you shall know it when you are here You have only to set out and that immediately unless you wish me to repent that I have taken such concern in your affairs Yours  aitnfully  Hertensia Villers  P S Harriet begs me to enclose my note within her letter so that you may read hers first  LETTER VI  To Mrs Villars  My dear and valuable friend  I PAY obedience to your letter and leave town immediately as you enjoin me so that this reply will not have reached you halt a dozen hours before you see me In reality I wish to have it go beforehand and in some sort spare my tongue the shame and trouble of revealing what it is to tell you Shall I even have sufficient courage thus to let you know my situation but the case is urgent and besides I merit my humiliation Well then know  madam I have shewn myself the most unjust and cruel of all husbands I have dared to disparage the unspotted virtue of my Amelia with my scandalous suspicions of my Amelia I repeat whose very looks I am unworthy now to meet It was when I most insulted her that she was most studious to preserve my name from ignominy One of my relations a young man whom I patronized was on the point of being utterly disgraced among his brother officers for certain youthful levities which he durst not communicate to me acquainted as he was with my impatient temper It was she who with the fruits of her oeconomy delivered him from the dishonour that he was going to bring both upon himself and me She had sufficient strength of mind to bear with my unworthy treatment and aspersions rather than expose him to my indignation by revealing his delinquency I have discovered very recently this motive for those secret interviews that so disturbed my mind and cannot keep from cursing my detested jealousy But how shall I endure her presence At her feet and without daring to look up I will implore her pardon I am posting to that quarter where she has fixed her retirement fortunately I must pass through Bath to reach it I shall see you by the way and kiss my almost orphan little ones Farewel I dare not sign a name which my jealousy has made so criminal  Mrs Villars Mr Torrington Harriet Sophia Caroline  Harriet  Well papa so you are pleased with what we have told you  Sophia  And think us very much improved  Mr Torrington  Yes my children I am charmed with every thing I have seen  Caroline  As well as with the little letter of my writing Was not it quite pretty  Mr Torrington  Admirable like yourself my little Caroline But where is your worthy governess I wish to see and thank her  Mrs Villars  I see her coming this way We will leave you with her Come my little dears come along with me  She goes out with Harriet Sophia and Caroline  Mr Torrington Mrs Torrington Mrs Torrington comes in but with a trembling step and Mr Torrington advances towards her  Madam let me ask your pardonButwhose features do I seeWho is this  Mrs Torrington  Well sir what causes this confusion Are you sorry that I have the care and education of your children  Mr Torrington  Sorry Nothing in you ever should have made me wonder had I but deserved the happiness of knowing youMy Amelia  Mrs Torrington  Why bestow that name upon meI have put it off  Mr Torrington  You have indeed and therefore kneeling at your feet I shall implore you to resume it  He falls upon his knees before her  Mrs Torrington  What would you do sir  Mr Torrington  If you would not behold me dieone wordone single word one of those sweetly sounding accents that were wont to make me happy  Mrs Torrington  Well then dearest husband rise and come to the embrace of your Amelia who still loves you  Mr Torrington  It is too muchToo muchI ask not such a blessingTell me only that you have ceased to hate me  Mrs Torrington  It should be my punishment to ask your pardon could such hatred ever come into my heart Speak only of  my  happiness I think of nothing in the world but  yours  Come then and let us both be happy in the conversation of our children  LETTER VII  To Mrs Villars  Dear Madam  I LEAVE Bath with every sense of gratitude that the services which I have experienced from your friendship cannot but inspire and fly towards London where I mean to furnish a new house for my Amelia She designs to  follow me some few days hence and to bring the children with her I hope your ladyship will also come and take your portion in the happiness that you have restored to c  Arthur Torrington  LETTER VIII  Dear Spouse  INSTEAD of seeing me or any of the children you will have a letter full of tears and lamentation On the day after your departure Harriet and Sophia all at once complained of being feverish and were attacked with such a headache that they could not possibly keep up We put them therefore instantly to bed Towards evening Caroline made just the same complaint All three are now covered quite over with a very thick smallpox of such a sort as I am told is very virulent I must forget that I never had this dreadful malady myself All night as well as day I keep my situation by their bed and every moment fear they will be suffocated I have felt already in myself a lassitude and heat in every limb but my affection makes me stranger than I should be otherwise Their love and tenderness sustain my courage I perceive that in the height of all their sufferings they refrain as much as they are able from complaint for fear of giving me uneasiness In the delirium of their fever they do nothing but pronounce your name and mine with tones of voice so moving that one cannot possibly express them and no earlier than this very morning Caroline desired to see you I replied that I could not send to London for you lest you should catch her illness "Oh no no mama said she do not be afraid I'll keep it all myself" "My child replied I upon this you might communicate the infection to him without losing it yourself" "So much the worse" said Caroline and swooned away with weakness but soon after coming to herself she called me saying "Dear mama you have the picture of papa about your neck pray let me kiss  There is no fear I suppose that  it  will catch the smallpox from me"Dearest children should I lose you Should myself perhapsI see about me the pr  ges of a dreadful  separationArm yourself therefore with resolution my dear spouse our life in this world is but as it were a moment Harriet is afraid lest my letter should afflict you and requests with tears that I would permit her writing something to console you I am fearful such an effort may exhaust her but more fearful to afflict her by my refusal I am therefore giving her my letter and her trembling hand writes this  My dear Papa  We are extremely ill all three but yet that is nothing  so do not grieve yourself I hope  She cannot write another word I find my strength sorsake me too I am seized all over with a mortal pain I hear Sophia groan and must go to her succour Farewel dearest spouse Take hope or arm yourself with fortitude of mind in this distress as possibly it may be needful But particularly whether life or death ensue love always yours  Amelia Torrington  LETTER IX  To Mr Torrington  Dear Friend  HOW shall I express the melancholy news of which you must be notwithstanding its un  el  omeness acquainted Try if you are able to divine the matter for my trembling hand demurs to write it Caroline still lives but as for Harriet and Sophia  ey alas are in the land of spirits Your unhappy wi  e as you may easily suppose was overwhelmed  this twofold loss for grief and watching so depr  d her that the infection which she received soon brought her to the last extremity Believe me my dear friend when I pretest that I would have bought her life could I have done so with the half of mine But what avail these empty wishes I can keep the fatal secret hid no longer At this moment they are ringing for her funeral She was not able to survive her children many hours Though you had flown to see her  once again you would certainly not have known her so much had the violence of the disorder changed her features I was with her constantly I did not leave her bed a moment I received her parting sighs and closed her eyelids It was altogether such a scene as will for ever live in my ideas I shall find it difficult to represent her fortitude and resignation to God's will It was not for herself that she sorrowed her last words were a fervent supplication in behalf of Caroline and you What consolation could I give you for her loss of which my heart has not as great a need as yours has Herself alone can soften your affliction Read the inclosed of which she wrote herself the first eight lines and with a faltering accent dictated the rest I join my voice to hers and in the a  dour of my friendship turn your recollection on the child that is still left you and to whom you owe now more than ever all the love and tenderness that a father can shew I will send her to you when she is perfectly recovered Her endearing manner will console your bosom and her education occupy your mind which otherwise might yield to painful recollections God be with you I regret that I have nothing to offer you but the melancholy language of condolence Yours  Hortensia Villars  LETTER X  To Mr Torrington  Dearest Spouse  I FIND myself expiring I am going to my children who I imagine to myself are holding out their arms that I should follow them and we shall rest together in one tomb Your life is mine I give it to my surviving infant Caroline is left to represent me Shew her all your tenderness Be her support and may  she  prove your consolation Life is short and you will both ere long rejoin us when we shall not fear a further separation Think not of my loss so much as of the happy place where I shall wait your coming What I was in this life I will still continue in another namely your  Amelia  THE LITTLE PRISONER  LETTER I  From Dorothea Justamond to Honoria Clancy  My dear Honoria  YOU would never guess what has lately happened to my brother to that upright and respected Daniel whose good heart and prudent conduct made all his friends that were so happy as to be of his acquaintance You remember I suppose the purse that mama presented him when you were by with three new guineas in it Well those three new guineas with the purse are gone and to increase your wonder the poor boy will not or cannot tell which way As it is supposed that he makes a secret of it from a principle of obstinacy he was shut up in a little room this morning where he is not to be visrted by any one and whence he must not hope to be delivered but by making known the whole affair How sincerely I lament him suffering this severity of punishment He has never been hitherto considered of an obstinate or headstrong disposition On the contrary he has been always commended for his docility and frankness I would willingly have pleaded in his favour but could not obtain a hearing Nevertheless I am very sure he has not to reproach himself with any crime or meanness Come this afternoon and see me if you have your liberty You may in that case comfort me in my dejected situation The misfortune of my brother hurts me no less than it would do had it happened to myself Adieu I am in expectation of your visit or reply  Dear Honoria  Your faithful and sincere  Dorothea  LETTER II  From Honoria Clancy to Dorothea Justamond  My dear Dorothea  I CANNOT but confess that I entertain some pity for your  upright  and  respected  Daniel but so little that he need not greatly tax his grateful nature to repay me I could never pardon him for always finding something or another to advance against me Not that he has ever gone so far as publicly to tell his notions of me If he had I should have known very well how to answer him but it is an easy matter by his looks to be convinced he thinks me trifling vain capricious and I know not what beside Whenever I have been censuring other people's impersections in their absence for the instruction of my friends to hear his manner of defending them one would imagine I were only venting slander Well at present then my little judge himself is under condemnation and indeed he must be highly guilty since his very parents have forgotten all the silly fondness that they had for him I am charmed that they have come to know him at last and would lay a wager that he deserves much greater punishment than he receives Obstinacy is a very frightful vice alone but in addition he is an awkward spendthrift All the money that he can fish out of his father he disperses foolishly among a tribe of ragamussins and has never had the spirit to employ it in a manner honourable to himself If he had spent those guineas in silk stockings fashionable buckles or the like one might excuse him Did I say excuse him one might certainly applaud his judgment in that case However as I said before I pity him a little being as he is your brother but Dorothea you I pity most sincerely being as you are his sister I cannot possibly wait upon you this evening it is such charming weather for a walk and then I have the prettiest dress that ever you saw just come home which I must certainly put on Adieu and think me always  Your sincerest  Honoria  LETTER III  From Dorothea Justamond to Honoria Clancy  Miss  I AM as pe  etrated as I ought to be with the avowal made me in year last of that slacere friendship which it professes I  have been glad if it had wrought upon you to  yourself a little more respectfully concerning the afternoon of my parents in behalf of Daniel and to speak w  more consideration of this last particularly now that  is so unhappy I admit not your condolence for my Misfortune as you intimate in being sister to the p  r I consider it my pride and glory and persuade myself you will acknowledge that I have reason so to d  when you have perused a letter that I received from  his evening and which I now send you Thought do  t throw a light on the affair I cannot look  language of a criminal I heartily congr  your pretty dress and wish you a delightful    Dorothea  LETTER IV  From Daniel Justamond to Dorothea his Sister  in the preceding  My dear Sister  I CAN easily persuade myself how much you are afflicted at my  and sit down to write this letter that your grief on my account may be in some sort mitigated Think not that I am a criminal or at least that I do not believe myself such The three guineas are at present in good hands in much better hands than mine But you will reply why therefore should I make a secret of the matter to  parents who must think me  ither very obstinate or very hypocritical in thus refusing them the considence which they have a right to expect This indeed is what embarrasses my resolution and I  do not know how to answer I must think maturely of it I have here in my solitude all the time that I can wish for that purpose If I perceive that I am in the wrong I will tell them so and frankly own the whole affair I am sure they will excuse me having frequently before excused me on confession of my faults I suffer more to think on their uneasiness than my imprisonment Adieu dear sister Let a poor recluse preserve his place in your affection and believe me with the like affection  Yours c  Daniel  LETTER V  From Dorothea Justamend to Honoria Clancy  My dearest Honoria  I MIGHT express myself a little harshly when I sent you half an hour ago the letter that I had just before received from Daniel I request you to overlook my fault ascribing my ill humour to the grief that I felt in finding you so ready to suspect my  or brother and at present as he cannot but be reestablished in your good opinion I hope that you will for his sake overlook it the more readily However I must tell you his affairs take now a very gloomy turn at least to all appearances One of our servants has made a discovery of the purse at a confectioner's hard by It seems he went into the shop for change and what should the confectioner take out among his gold and silver but the very purse which the servant instantly recollected Yet he did not speak a word about it there but came directly home and told my father who is dressing now that he may go to the confectioner's and make enquiry how he got the purse It is no way probable that my brother should have laid out three guineas on sweetmeats when he deprives himself of every thing by indulging his extreme generosity Papa himself is of the same opinion but by what means could the purse be where it is He has not lost it since he knows as he informed us where it was which certainly he meant to say by this expression  it is at present in good hands  Why therefore should he make a secret of it Truly I cannot tell what to think upon the subject be it notwithstanding  what it will I am entirely at my ease on his account and have a sort of considence that the affair will only terminate to his advantage I conclude and once more beg you to overlook the harshness of my last believing me  Your faithful friend  Dorothea  LETTER VI  From Honoria Clancy to Dorothea Justamond  Dear Dorothea  I AM no less at my ease than you upon account of Daniel and as much persuaded that this affair will turn out to his advantage He has learnt I make no doubt already in his solitude that he himself is far from being quite exempt from such defects as he has frequently ascribed to me and the severe correction which he will certainly receive will be revenge enough for me On these considerations I am entirely at my ease on his account because by this means the affair will end to his advantage It is indeed quite necessary to his growing perfection that on this occasion he should undergo the severest punishment How my sanctimonious Mr Daniel you would persuade your parents that you give every thing away in charity and fish thus cunningly for money which you afterwards lay out three guineas at a time in sweetmeats Truly I do not wonder that he should be so backward in revealing the affair It would be very honourable to him Obstinate a cheat and a glutton three good qualities indeed and all at once discoverable in him Mighty sine He calls the hands of a confectioner good hands because as I suppose they make good things There is charming logic for you But adieu my dear Dorothea I sincerely mourn your blindness to this goodfornothing brother's faults and burn with absolute impatience till you have told me how your hero will get clear of this adventure After all my criticizing comments I am so deeply interested in his welfare as to beg that you would send me the first news possible concerning him I hope you will not refuse this mark of friendship to your faithful  Honoria  LETTER VII  From Dorethea Justamond to Honoria Clancy  Miss  I TAKE the earliest opportunity in my power to satissy your generous curiosity My hero's grand adventure now is terminated in a way that gives satisfaction to every body every body indeed except the wicked And this last circumstance magnifies the pleasure that I enjoy from this communication  Here now follow the particulars of the affair at length My brother late last night was franding at the door and saw a poor old man go by him followed by three children that were crying bitterly He supped them and enquired the readen of their s  ess The old man was s  ashamed he could not answer but the eldest of the children told him notwithstanding frequent interruptions caus  d by  bing that they had not had a bit of any thing that day "Alas my little master" added he "we are greatly to be pitied We had formerly as you have a  e house but now are left without a shed to cover us Our parents are both dead of broken hearts and we have no friend to help us but our grandfather and he is far too old and weak to work for our support" The poor old man while this was saying hid his face and sighed most lamentably Daniel who it seems was very much affected at the scene before him had not time to take advice but ran up stairs immediately to fetch his purse and gave it to the poor old man He wept afresh with joy and admiration at my little brother's generosity but would not take the money Daniel fell into a passion seeing this and nothing but the old man's acquiescence in the gift could calm him He did accept the purse but as he judged the charity that he had received to be too considerable for a child like my brother to bestow he resolved to bring it back next day He went with such a view to leave it at the shop of the confectioner and asked to have a shilling only to provide his little family a supper I cannot tell you how he made the money up again but not a quarter of an hour ago and just before my father  could set out to speak with the confectioner he brought the purse with all the money in it to our house I could have wished miss that you had been present at this scene you would then have been taught to entertain a different notion of my brother's generous heart His noble sacrifice together with the old man's honest scruples made us all shed tears The children and himself have had as much as twice the value of the purse and Daniel too has been paid for what he did with sisty prayers and blessings The concealment of this bounteous action which my brother thought was nothing but his duty puts a greater value on it in the eyes of my papa and merits at my hand a measure of additional affection  As this letter is the last that I ever mean to send you I have now the honour to subscribe myself as ceremoniously as pen can do it  Miss  your most obedient And most humble servant  Dorothea Justemond  OLD LAWRENCE  LETTER I  From George Wallace to Catharine  Dear Catharine  I Have dismal news to tell you Our good old friend Lawrence is no more You recollect he had been out of order ever since last autumn For a fortnight past he had not left his room Last Monday evening when I came from school they told me that he had died that afternoon I could not I assure you refrain from crying bitterly His long indisposition had beforehand rendered him much dearer to me I employed the time that I had to spare from school in doing him whatever service I was able After all alas I owed him more than I had time and means to pay He was our friend and I may add too benefactor from the cradle In our earliest childhood  we lived more a great deal in his arms than on our feet He was never out of temper but always kind and chearful How delighted was he when he had it in his power to afford us any new pleasure or to disguise an old one so that we might think it new I verily believe that all his pain in dying was that death prevented him from being any longer useful to us He had been of older standing in the family than our papa and though he was no better than a common servant every body looked upon him with a sort of veneration During his last illness no one paid a visit here without enquiring "and how fares the good old Lawrence" I could see that the question was agreeable to my papa who always looked on Lawrence as a very faithful friend If so no wonder then that he supported him in his old age and gave him every sort of comfort that he could require A gentleman could not have been more comfortably situated or more attentively treated Last night when he was buried I desired papa's permission to be present at the ceremony He could not without some difficulty grant me such a favoar lest it might have a bad effect upon me but he saw that I should have suffered more from being absent I accompanied the body therefore holding up a corner of the pall I thought that by this office we were still attached to one another and that really in some sort I possessed him still When I was forced to quit my hold my hand was just as if it had been numbed and did not open without difficulty but if this was mournful it was much more melancholy when they let him down into the grave and especially when they filled it up I could not take my eyes off from the spot Till then I could not be persuaded that Death had wholly separated us As long as I could see his coffin there remained still something of him but when this remainder disappeared then I felt that I had for ever lost him All night long I saw him in my dreams his ghost by no means frightened me it seemed to smile upon me and I rushed into its arms I passed this morning in my chamber all alone and was employed in writing you this letter I designed to send you but a line or two whereas my subject has extended while I spoke of LawrenceOur good friend is come to see me Mr Hutton that venerable worthy man who takes so much delight in giving people pleasure when he cannot do them good and he  has left me an exceedingly pathetic story of a servant woman who worked hard to support her mistress after she was fallen into poverty Indeed I found it so exceedingly pathetic that I set immediately about transcribing it and send you a fair copy since the reading of it may be a solace to you as it was to me At every act of friendship that Elspy performed I cried out This Lawrence would have done for us had we been in the situation of the lady Ah poor Lawrence Ah my good friend Lawrence Fare you well dear sister I must here conclude my letter being sent for down by my papa to entertain him gloomy as I am myself Assure my aunt and uncle of my best respects and let each have two sweet kisses which they will place to my account We have had a loss in Lawrence which we cannot possibly make up but by loving one another more sincerely Farewell then once more from him who with a renewed heart of friend and brother signs himself yours  George Wallace  ELSPY CAMPBELL  This piece was inclosed in the preceding letter  MRS Macdowell a widow lady of an ancient and respectable family in Scotland after having enjoyed the advantages of fortune till the age of fifty years saw herself all at once suddenly deprived of them and reduced to the most helpless indigence She never had been blessed with any children who might now support her by the labour of their industry and every other individual of the family was equally involved in her misfortunes Wandering in the Highlands she was all day long soliciting a shelter for the night and a morsel of bread for her subsistence  Elspy Campbell who had been her faithful servant many years and was always treated very kindly by her ancient mistress learns these dismal tidings in her humble cottage whither she was now retired to pass the remnant  of her days far distant from her former service She immediately sets out in search of her respectable mistress There was a line marked our by her misfortunes and the grateful Elspy had but to walk in it After much laborious travel she at last found the mournful object of her journey and falling down on the ground before her began thus "Oh my dear good mistress though I am hardly younger than yourself I am notwithstanding that much stronger and more capable of working You on the contrary are far too feeble to go through with any thing like labour on account of your former way of life your troubles and the several infirmities that are come all at once upon you Come and take up your abode with me I have a little cottage it is well situated and keeps out the weather In addition to my cottage I have a garden also which produces me more potatoes than both of us can consume When I have tried all methods to support you if I can or rather when God's providence has once whatever he thinks proper to support us both you shall be free to quit me if you find an inn with better entertainment or stay with me if you should not find one Be of courage my dear mistress I was always  out and hearty in your service and thank God I am still the same I will find you food if any will but show itself when I have sown my little bit of ground and if it will not show itself in that case I will dig down till I rind it  "  "O my generous Elspy" said the afflicted widow "I resign myself entirely to your friendship I will live and die with one of so much gratitude for I am sure God's blessing will be always with you"They set out immediated for Elspy's dwelling The cottage was indeed extremely little but possessed a healthful situation cleanliness and order were the only decorations that it could boast There was a hole on one side in the wall through which a little light proceeded when the wind was not that way but when it would have incommoded her the hole was stopped completely by a sod with rose leaves  eat into it and poor blspy was obliged to be contented with the little light that reached her down the chimney Elpy's bed which was invisible when people entered was defended from the cold that would have reached it through the doorway by a bank of earth It  had a mattress stuft with straw good sheets a pair of blankets and coarse woollen rug It had not curtains but when Elspy found that she was in future to be honoured with the friendship and society of so respectable a guest she bethought herself to hang the walls about it with a bulrush lining which was warmer than the silkiest damask In this bed slept Mrs Macdowell with her feet both placed against poor Elspy's bosom who was used to bend herself almost double round the widow's legs that she might keep them warm She never would consent to lie beside her mistress but the more she saw her fallen from her former splendour still the more obedience and respect she showed her to wipe out by that means all idea of the change she had experienced in her fortune An old Bible Robinson Crusoe and a few odd volumes of devotion and morality which once had covers furnished ample matter for their evening's conversations With respect to their repasts they frequently had eggs at all times milk and were never without potatoes The best baked potatoes fieshest eggs and largest bowl of milk were constantly placed before Mrs Macdowell  It will doubtless be a matter of some curiosity to know how Elspy could keep up the honours of her cot in such a state of oeconomical abundance To do this she had her spinningwheel in winter and her labours of the field  n harvest It must notwithstanding be acknowledged that she possessed a manifest advantage over every younger woman not so much for any natural activity as for an obtuse angle in her line of bodily direction so that both her hands and eyes were nearer by a great deal to the ground than otherwise they would have been and readier for her spinningwheel Besides when things were raised in price above her means to purchase them she had but to go out and beg assistance in the neighbouring towns and villages For this she had contrived a tolerable efficacious method She would go among the richest farmers only and when got before their door stand still and lifting up her hands to heaven cry out "I come to ask your charity by no means for myself for I can live on any thing but for my mistress a lady of noble blood daughter of Lord James and grandchild of Lord Archibald"If the farmers gave her any thing or what sufficed her reasonable expectations she would add "May the Almighty's blessing  with my mistress's and Elspy Campbell's come upon this house and its inhabitants"It is easy to imagine what success this blessing and the expectation of a different salutation from the lips of Elspy had she been refused produced from people naturally hospitable and exceedingly attached to their nobility She obtained by this method victuals cloaths and very often money which she carefully put up to buy her mistress shoes and stockings and these when half worn out served afterwards for herself  Thus they lived both happy one in her exertions and the other in her gratitude The generous Elspy was extremely rigorous on the subject of her duty Mrs Macdowell was a gentlewoman and though supported by Elspy was not to forego the privileges of nobility that is to say she was not to do any thing like work no not so much as wash her feet herself One day as Elspy was employed in carrying out a basket full of dung to lay on her potatoe beds her mistress had come out to get a pitcher full of water and was now returning with it to the cottage Elspy saw her put the basket down and running to her took away the pitcher emptied it and fetched her other water When she brought it in she said with much respect "Pardon me madam but you that are daughter of Lord James and grandchild to Lord Archibald never shall demean yourself by carrying water while I live and have my limbs to do it for you"  The report of so much generosity in one so indigent at last reached me who am the writer of this story and I sent her every quarter such assistance as my fortune would allow As long as Elspy lived which was upwards of six years from the time of my first learning these particulars whenever I sat down to dine or sup in company and was required to give my toast it was always Elspy Campbell My attachment to this name generally made the company eager to know something of the lady who engrossed so great a share of my affection They would consequently ask me begging pardon for their freedom when I told them Elspy Campbe  was an ancient beggar woman "What" they would cry out "a beggar""Yes but hear the rest" and then would follow the whole story such in substance as I have already told it Hardly ever could I finish but halfcrowns and halfguineas rained  into my hat for Elspy These small sums which I was sure to send her pretty often once occasioned her to ask my servant "Who is it that sends you Doubtless he is a friend of God He does me good as God does though I never see him"  Mrs Macdowell died and Elspy very quickly after through affliction for the loss of her good mistress She remembered nothing but the bounty of her former benefactress what her gratitude had done in consequence of that remembrance she forgot  The generous the heroic servility of Elspy was not as it might have been a spark of gratitude that crackled for a moment and went out it was an ardent flame that blazed for twenty years till death suppressed it for a season in the grave where she was laid to rest for it is not utterly put out since from her ashes it will certainly burst forth again with renovated brightness on the morning of that day that never is to finish  LETTER II  From Catharine Wallace to George her brother  Dearest Brother  WHAT sorrowful tidings your letter brings me Am I never more to see my dear friend Lawrence Poor good man he seemed to apprehend as much himself the day that I left you to come here "It is very likely dear Miss Kitty" said he "you will never see me more and therefore think of me at least" Alas I have been thinking of him and concluded how it would please him when he found that I had on my return I thought to knit him a stout pair of stockings for next winter's wear and was at work upon them at the very moment that I received your letter with intelligence that he was dead The work fell from me After I had picked it up I shed a stood of tears "They are not then for him" I cried "Oh yes they shall be for I will finish both and put them in my drawers that they may daily be a token of remembrance for him"You do not tell  me in your letter if he often spoke about me I am sure he did but that you feared to aggravate my grief by saying so I am greatly grieved that I was not present to attend upon him in his sickness as I verily believe that the pleasure of our services would have prolonged his days I think you acted very properly in going to his burial I acknowledge had I been at home I should not have possessed a heart to do so but am therefore more affected at your strength of mind and friendship  In the sorrow caused me by your letter it was impossible for me to read the history of Elspy Campbell without shedding tears I thank you for it and am thoroughly convinced as you are that our friend Lawrence would have done the same for us had we been in the place of Mrs Macdowell I imagine it is the fault of masters if the major part of servants are not Lawrences and Elspies They address them frequently so roughly how can they suppose their servants should do any thing but fear them Since by accidental circumstances they are placed in an inferior rank is it humanity to tread them under foot or rather is it not our duty to afford such tokens of affection as may raise them in their own esteem and gain us their attachment People seek to make themselves respected by their countrymen and neighbours why not then do more and seek to be respected in their families by those who are present with them every moment of the day Why not look upon them as a second class of children Are there even many masters who would do to benefit the dearest friend they are possessed of what the generous Elspy did in favour of her mistressWhen my uncle had perused your letter he informed me that a society of gentlemen in France had very lately recompensed a conduct just like Elspy's I am glad to hear that it meets with imitation It must certainly shew masters the necessity of being kind and courteous to their servants since it  them that in spite of present fortune they may come to want their succour one day or another nor can servants hear of such a conduct and not feel a species of encouragement to serve their masters with fidelity and diligence I think if ever we keep house we shall be able like papa to fill it with such people as will serve us with their hearts no less than with their hands  This week has been a very sad one for your poor sister Yesterday my uncle took me out a walking with him in the country to divert my sorrow Suddenly we heard a drum strike up we hastened to the spot It was for several new recruits that had been levied and were going then to join their regiments There were mixed among the soldiers many countrywomen who no doubt had children if not husbands too amongst the party for they did nothing but embrace and kiss each other and shed tears When we had looked a little at this multitude a woman dressed in mourning of a very decent and respectable appearance drew our observation She was taking leave of a young man who bit his lips to keep from crying She gave him a bottle which my uncle said was brandy and a little piece of canvas that had something wrapped up in it He accepted one but would not take the other though she pressed him very earnestly My uncle upon this drew near and said Is that your son there my good woman Yes says she my only son sir and the would has not a better My poor husband died ten months ag  and left me with three little girls besides the eldest not quite five years old Our last bad harvest made him  five pounds in debt When he was dead the creditors came on me and I thought would take away my little field which is all that we have for our support This recruiting party then were with us and a wealthy farmer's son had some how or another been drawn in to enlist He made it known about the country that if any one would take his place he should receive four pounds My son applied and said that for five guineas he would be his man which was at last agreed to Of this I did not know a word until every thing was settled otherwise I should have begged my son to leave his sisters and myself to want a little for the present rather than deprive me of his help he being every thing imaginable to us and the only friend that we have I thought I should have swooned when he presented me the guineas which he had just received for enlisting I applied to the recruiting serjeant to break off the bargain but he would not lend an ear to any thing that I said My son endeavoured to console me every way in his power by saying that my little field was now set free and therefore would preserve the children and myself from real want Be comforted  said he I shall be quartered in the neighbourhood a little longer so that every evening when our exercise is over I can come and work a little for you and at worst my time of service is not longer than three years and I shall then have my dischargeAlas cried she when every thing was going on so well I did not doubt of being able soon to pay my debts and he must leave me now Perhaps the war will come again and I shall never see him more  My uncle asked her what it was that she would have given him in the piece of canvas She replied it was a guinea which had been paid her not a week before by a  ady for the weaning of her child It was all the money added she that I have on earth and I designed to keep it for some great emergency I only wish that he would have taken it but should have known him better He would never rob me as he said no not accept of any thing when he had all day long been labouring for me on the contrary he used to give me what he earned among the  for his work My uncle took down her direction  to do whatever he was able for her She appeared extremely sensible of such a kindness and her  lity affected me as much for twenty times I was in tears while she stood uttering her complaint and yet I think that I pitied the poor young man still much more It was very easy to discern the violence that he did himself to hide his sorrow from his mother and companions notwithstanding there was nothing in that sorrow that he had any need to blush at His poor mother wished to go a little further with him but as soon as ever the drum struck up she fell into a swoon We brought her home and tried all methods to console her I by gentle language and my uncle by promises of kindness  Hear me my good brother while I tell you an idea that has just now struck me From the loss of Lawrence we can tell how wretched they must be who are divided from the object of their love The mother suffers surely more than we as having lost much more than we who do but mourn a friend We cannot bring poor Lawrence back to life but may restore at least a son to his afflicted mother I have done some needlework to please my uncle which he means to recompense by giving me an  elegant new gown I will have the gown in ready money And do you on your side use the greatest expedition to complete the drawing that my papa has ordered I am sure he will pay you very generously for it We will then unite our little stock and purchase the young soldier his discharge thus shewing our regard to the memory of old Lawrence so that if mankind are to be recompensed in future for the good that they do in this life this kind action will be put to his account who was the cause thereof and he will know that we love him still as much as ever I shall set out this day se'nnight to come home when we will settle the affair together and desire papa to execute it He will certainly be glad to serve us and this hope is much the sweetest that I can taste till I have once again the joy of seeng you Farewel I am rejoiced that I can on my part contribute the renewed friendship of which you speak and which will last as long as I have breath  Yours CATHARINE WALLACE  FIDELE LETTER I  From Dormer Lennox to Jessica his sister  Dear Sister  I Think I see you put on an air of importance on receiving a letter from me already when I have hardly got a mile beyond the threshold of the door However be not very proud of such an honour since I write it in the first place by command as my papa imagines that if I start a correspondence and you second it we shall acquire some ease in letterwriting which he says can only be attained by practice just like other arts and in the next place since I write not so much for your sake as that of my canarybird When I set out I quite forgot to recommend him to your friendship and I know of some  young ladies who would have an object constantly before their eyes and yet forget it i  their memory should not be conti  ually interested by a compliment bestowed at season  le intervals upon their vanity Know then that in the fulness of my power I make you governess of Fidele and grant you the entire controul of his houshold in future Take the greatest care not to forget the duties of your office if you would not have me take it from you It is extremely proper that I should make in this place one or two sagacious observations namely that the bird can no more live on nothing than yourself that if he does not eat and drink he cannot live that he will be incapable of singing if he dies and last of all that if he ceases singing neither you nor I can hear him which would be a pity I conceive it needful also to remind you of his service the other day when you were making such sad work  s you remember of your minuet by moving to his music while your disregarded Mr Dupré's kit The little creature set up such a pipe that Mr Dupré turned his anger all on him forgetting what your giddy heels deserved These reasons are I think sufficient to engage your friendship in behalf of Fidele but still if gratitude and music have no manner of effect upon your marble heart I have nothing out the thunder of my eloquence to move youTremble therefore Think him dead already Yes Jessica dead and then determine how you will be able to support so shocking an idea Fancy that you behold him lying with his feet uppermost his wings grown stiff his eyes and little beak shut fast for ever See him laid upon his back within the little box that you intend for his coffin and surrounded on every side with nightshade vervain cypressbranches and the weepingwillow Every body mourns him They enquire what cruel hand has plunged him thu  to eternal darkness A lamenting voice makes answer It was I unfeeling as I am and instantly you throw yourself beside him But I think you weep If so let me cry Victory for I have nothing now to sear upon account of Fidele or for the quiet of your shade Besides his ordinary victuals do not forget to let him have every day a bit of biscuit or a lump of sugar You will also do extrem  well to shade his house with something green as it would soften his affliction in my absence As I dare persuade myself that you will for my  sake worthily perform the duties of your charge I purpose sending you as some encouragement for all your zeal and industry a faithful narrative of my extended travels You will see adventures and atchievments in it such as should be handed down to late posterity Farewel my dearest sister I give up the playful stile at least to tell you as persuasively as I am able how I love you and with what affection I shall always be  Your gentle brother  Dormer Lennox  LETTER II  From Jessica to Dormer  Dear Brother  TRULY one must have queer notions to suppose that a sister should be proud of hearing from her brother I imagine all the boasting should be rather upon your side in reflecting that for once at least you have performed your duty and not had your ears well pulled beforehand though you lose all merit in the matter by insinuating that you have written to me by papa's command and for the sake of little Noisy But indeed you needed not have recommended Fidele so strongly to my care or lavished such a deal of rhetoric in his behalf He is worthy of all my attention on his own account so pray do not be uneasy lest I should not use him kindly It is true I shall not fill his trough till it runs over after the example of some little boys that I know who would not care a farthing should he burst as certainly he would were he as fond as they are of his belly Very likely too they would make one think that they overload him thus with victuals purely through kindness when they only do it that they may not have so troublesome a task again upon their hands for ten or fifteen days to come No no I will show myself much more regular in my attention to him as he certainly shall have fresh victuals every morning Yesterday when I approached his cage to clean it the first thing that I saw was seed sufficient to subtist him for a month without including what was scattered on the bottom To be sure I must confess he is such a spend  hrift  that he scatters more about him in an hour than would suffice him for a day But how shall I describe the floor of his apartment Thanks to your attention or your slothful waste it was exactly like a pond occasioned by continual overflowings from the fountain and poor Fidele could not descend for fear of being drowned How rejoiced he was to see the dry land At first he could not think of coming down without precaution as he tried it with one foot while with the other he clung closely to the wirework Thus without the least expence have I enlarged his habitation for he always kept upon the perches fearing to dirt his feet and tail at least if not as I have said just now to be drowned I have strewed a layer of fine sand upon the bottom of his mansion and adorned the sides and top with groundsel so that now he may suppose himself within a shady grove In future brother you may do as you think proper but it is I that take upon me to provide for Fidele I will have his palace serve you as a model of propriety and taste in  your  apartment I have written now enough I think to quiet the uneasiness that you intimated in your letter and must tell you that I have also my inquietudes which I proceed to mention You are certainly a little giddyheaded and we have here a sly black cat that comes a prowling daily Take you care when you return I have observed that he has conceived a love for Fidele sufficient to alarm one Yesterday betimes when I came in to give him food I forgot to shut the door and puss had crept in  ly after me When I had waited on the bird and given him what he wanted I begun to thumb your books when suddenly I heard a tender  mewing  behind me I turned instantly about and saw Grimalkin wriggling his whole body every way upon a sofa opposite the cage He was admiring Fidele he played his tail about and seemed to say "My dear sweet pretty bird come now and perch close by me or else stay I will jump upon your cage for only see what nice soft paws I have to hug you but remark he carefully concealed his claws I will fondle you all day and press you to my tender heart Do not let my whiskers frighten you they are long enough I must acknowledge but wont hurt you I have a little mouth beneath them Fidele with which I will kiss your pretty beak" Now what I do you imagine Fidele replied to these fine words Why nothing but with ease one might discern that he  was not likely to become Grimalkin's dupe and I suppose in pussey's place he would have been as great a rogue Have you been his instructor brother after allHe stooped and raised his head he shook his feathers and cast many a look of diffidence upon the orator and of confidence on me as if he would have said "I know you very well Your sugared words your nice soft paws and little mouth concealed beneath your whiskers are no less perfidious than your tender heart You may deceive perhaps a poor mouse but meOh no I laugh at all your cunning and defy your malice I have here a friend to save me" Upon which he set a crying  queek queek queek  with all his might I understood him perfectly well and without pretending that I heard any thing I ran instantly to that part of the chamber where there stood a cistern full of water and besprinkled our young gentleman so finely as to put out all at once the fervour of his friendship For he needed but one jump to be upon the floor and as he ran away he shook his coat as if he had the ague Recollect this observation should he come incognito upon a visit after you have returned  This mealymouthed goodnatured animal whom many in the world resemble made me recollect an Ode our friend wrote and which was lying in the papercase I send it you that if you know of any good composer in your neighbourhood you may prevail upon him for my sake to set it as they say to music  ODE  OF those folks with the sly hypocritical air  With manners so nice  And looks so precise  The sight I was never yet able to bear  When I see them I think of a cat on the watch  Near some highseason'd dish  Whether flem fowl or fish  Where the scent is so sweet  He would venture his feet  And longs to be making a snatch  With an innocent look quite gentle and free  He'll jump on your knee  There waving his tail he'll mew and all that  And so fondly he'll pat  And appear so demure  That you'll think to be sure  No mischief can lurk in the heart of our cat  At the favoury bit which already in fancy  He has eaten up quite  You'll hardly perceive him to cast a sly glance  Yet look but askance  And at once to your titbit good night  For taking a spring at the morsel so nice  He makes sure of his prey and then off in a trice  Heighpresto you'd swear it was all necromancy  I wait with great impatience to receive the narrative that you promise of your travels which must needs be very curious I shall go and dine tomorrow in the country with mama If any thing should happen of an interesting nature on the road I pledge myself to give you a relation of it Since you mean a visit to posterity I shall be charmed to share with you in the praise of our descendants In the interval I wish to have it known that you never will possess a truer friend in any one than in your sister  Jessica Lennox  LETTER III  From Dormer to Jessica  Dear Sister  I return you my sincerest thanks for the delightful letter that you have sent me to dispel my fears The scene between my Fidele and your black cat with their imaginary conversation could not but amuse me greatly I allow Grimalkin's elequent harangue to be very clever but the other's  queek queek queek  much more so since it ended in the ad  er  's ab  late defeat through your incomparable courage and for which you ought to have a cistern  full of water in your escutcheon when the herald makes you out your arms  I have been hard at work these three days on the journal of my travels which I promised to send you as a recompence for your care of Fidele Papa approves the thought of our communicating our adventures thus to one another His opinion as I have already told you is that by this sort of correspondence we shall acquire a habit of inditing with facility and properly reflecting on such objects as may strike our sight As much as I have written he informs me seems to have been done with accuracy and desires to read the account that you have promised of your dinner in the country with mama Frederic and Louisa certainly were of the party Oh how much impertinence must of necessity have passed between you but indeed though you should tell me only of your own I know you have a stock in hand sufficient to supply a chapter and that chapter not the shortest that was ever written To encourage you in sending me this chapter with the greatest expedition I shall be myself as quick as possible in the collation of the several parcels of my narrative inscribed on more than twenty scraps of paper You will have it in a week or thereabouts Adieu I clasp you in the mean time to my heart and am as long as I have life  Your brother and your friend  Dormer Lennox  LETTER IV  From Jessica to Dormer  Dear Brother  WHAT can you be thinking of to let me wait so long before I see the journal of your expedition Are you gone like Gulliver to some unknown strange island for the sake of having such atchievements to record as no one will be authorized to contradict I cannot but admire the great exactitude and order on which you pride yourself so much in the mention of your twenty scraps of paper  scattered up and down no doubt in every corner of your chamber It will be fortunate however if the little cat belonging to your habitation does not please herself by playing with the best part of your narrative I should not be astonished were I to discover many chasms in it or perceive that you had begun with the conclusion and affixed the fagend as we say where the commencement should be which would prove at least as entertaining as the chapter stuffed with my impertinences I cannot tell at present if the cisternfull of water would look well in my escutcheon but suppose that your sybill's leaves would make a special coat of arms for you Since my papa desires to see my narrative I shall make h  ste to send it in a day or two but hope that the intervening time will bring me yours for I should really be sorry to postpone my great adventures till the Grecian Calends which as I have somewhere read means just the same as if I should omit relating them for ever Pray embrace papa on my account as tenderly as you are able and desire him to return you as affectionately as he is able all the kisses that you have given him for  Your sister and your friend  Jessica Lennox  P S Inclosed you have my Journal  Journal of my Travels  ONE has no occasion to go over so much ground as you have travelled to be able to supply the reader with adventures We had hardly passed the second turnpike on the Clapham road before we fell in with a drover who was bringing up about a hundred sheep to London As our coachman thought his honour concerned in not permitting such a scrabby drove of cattle to usurp the road and make him quit his track he drove the carriage through them The poor sheep who are accounted to have honest hearts but we  k intellects not knowing whither they should run in their confusion got between the horses legs and some were even entangled in the spokes The drover bid the coachman stop as loud as he  could roar but the coachman deaf to his vociferations would not in the least relax his speed and still continued on the trot The wind was rather fresh and therefore we had all the glasses up My brother Frederic wished to know by what means the poor sheep would free themselves from their embarrassment Unfortunately he forgot that if he wished to look about him it was necessary first of all to let the glass down and of course he thrust his head quite through and through the brittle crystal which that moment broke into a thousand pieces You may judge with what alacrity he drew his head in once again but in so doing he was slightly wounded in his forehead by a piece of the broken glass He put his hand directly on the part and so contrived as with the little blood proceeding from the scratch to smear his face all over completely and looked exactly like the Jolly Bacchus at the alehouse opposite our door Louisa at this sight was sure that her brother must have had his nose cut off and did not doubt but it had dropped among the sheep on which the tenderhearted little thing began to cry Frederic ah my poor dear brother till mama had with a little scented water which she poured upon her handkerchief wiped his face clean and given it once more that sly look which you know it possesses Well dear brother what are your ideas I for my part fancy that you do not engross all the giddiness belonging to our family and already little Frederic gives full proof that he is not a jot less giddy than his elder brother  Nothing worth mention happened after this event till we arrived at Margaret's our dear nurse with whom we were to dine and stay till evening After having all of us received her kind embraces we went through the house and into the fields where we proposed to take a walk By accident I was a little distant from the rest and as I passed along a hedge observed three little birds that had been taken by the leg in a perfidious springe The pretty creatures flapped their wings most lamentably and implored me or at least I thought so to set them free You may suppose I did not show myself insensible to their petition Instantly I broke their bonds and had the pleasure to behold how grateful they appeared for I could fancy gratitude in all their motions as they flew away This pity that I had shown them did not please a  little country boy who lived hard by and had established very greedy hopes upon the sale of these three prisoners so that their deliverance as I mean to let you see and shortly but for accidental circumstances might have cost us dear  The sun towards noon had dissipated all the mists The day was so delightful that mama desired we might enjoy the pleasure of a rural meal and therefore requested Margaret to let us have our dinner in the garden After dinner we had strawberries and cream and at the very moment when poor Frederic with the freedom which country manners allow happened to be lifting up the platter to his mouth that he might save himself the trouble of dispatching matters with the spoon a stone behold ye struck it right upon the rim and overset its whose contents upon the table not without first plentifully besprinkling several of us round about You should have seen us in the height of our confusion palpitating as we sat with fright as if we had imagined that Jupiter was flinging down his thunderbolts among us Margaret's husband who is not a man to swoon away at every noise that moment posted towards the garden door to catch this thundering deity who was certainly the little peasant that had set the springes But the deity like those mentioned in Homer who amused themselves at the expence of mortals had already made himself invisible It was all lost labour that our host stood sentry at the door He only saved us from the danger of another thunderbolt which might have otherwise been pointed at us  Dinner was now over and I thought of paying one more visit to the neighbouring hedges and delivering if I could some other prisoners when mama informed us that we must think of setting out on our return We entered the coach once more with some reluctance after having made dear Margaret our little presents each There never sure had been a finer evening From a hill upon the top of which our coachman stopped to give his horses breath we had the pleasure to behold a spacious horizon aderned with clouds of every colour and set off with gold The sun that as I thought rejoiced in having access to us given him by Frederic coloured out of gratitude Louisa's face and his with all the purple of his rays Our cousin who you know has been abroad at such a sight  turned round and told mama that they looked exactly like the cherubims that Roman Catholics are used to place for ornament about the altars in their churches  The poor sheep that we met in the morning certainly must have alarmed their comrades and gone off as we encountered none on our return We met no sort of company but half a dozen asses who had certainly a very reverend figure and a mule or two Our horses who I fancy thought they could discern a family resemblance in these last were giving up the righthand side of the road and complimenting them with fifty gambols and curvets but our proud coachman would preserve the honour of his seat and feelingly convinced them with his whip that they were creatures of much more importance and that ranking as they did above them in all books of natural history it was but just they should preserve it on the road They were obliged to yield assent to arguments so striking and got home in perfect order and without another misadventure  LETTER V  IT is not in the least degree astonishing my dear sister that you should come off so easily in the recital of a journay which has brought you into company with none but short horned or long eared animals a giddy boy that breaks window glasses or a little raggamussin that pelts you with stones If such affairs you call adventures I can hardly guess what name you can find out magnisicent enough for mine And after having told you what has happened to me in the compass of a single parish you may easily imagine what surprising matters I should have to tell you in a longer journey I begin to think that at the period of Knight Errantry I should have made a pretty figure and particularly if I myself sung the great atchievements that I should perform which trust me I would do lest any one who might be tempted to record them should not do it to my l  king  Inclosed therefore I send you a small specimen of my abilities as a journalist I submit it to your censure or to mend the expression recommend you to peruse it with your greatest possible attention otherwise 'tis not unlikely but you will miss of some among its singular and striking beauties  Yours  Dormer  Journal of my Travels  WE rolled along in silence for the space of twenty minutes in our carriage with no less velocity than the clouds above our heads I blessed the memory of him who first of all invented this delightful way of travelling without pain or trouble and shall always think it charming till some other person brings the project to perfection of transporting us still more delightfully by means of a ballcon with eagles to direct it  I was meditating on this subject when of a sudden I perceived the coachman violently exercised at something or another His great coat had slipped from off his seat on one of the front wheels which carried it about the center After many revolutions he had made shift to fasten on a sleeve which he was pulling to him and ejaculating as he tugged My coat my coat I thrust my head out hastily to see what ailed him when my hat blew off so I joined in concert with the coachman and cried out as lust  ly My hat my hat Poor Jeffry from his station in the rear stood witness to my lamentations and leaned over towards me when behold ye the furred cap that he wears fell off He did not imitate us crying out My cap my cap but aiming to recover it when falling somehow or another lost his footing and came down the nearest way headforemost Happily for Jeffry we were going through a very soft quagmire otherwise I cannot pretend to tell you what misfortune would have befel his limbs at least I am sure his nose and chin would have been both demolished as he fell into the quagmire belly downwards All this happened in a minute My papa in this confusion was the only person who retained his senses He let down the glass in front and seizing on the coachman's reins which now were fallen from him stopped the horses Upon this the coachman getting down made shift to free his coat But what long faces did he make when he saw in the middle of the back a monstrous rent through which a judge might easily have thrust his head and not disordered his huge wig On his side Jeffry as I saw had got his mouth so filled with mud that he could not for a time bring out a single syllable O sister had you seen him  thus beplaistered as he was affect a grin in order to show papa that his fall had broke no bones I am sure you would have laughed for a month to come at recollecting his appearance He did nothing in the world but sneeze and sputter shake himself and rub his knees and elbows with both hands his coat which had been green no longer now preserved that colour any where except behind In short he looked as if he was drest for a masquerade  He went a little back to seek his foxskin cap By great good luck the maker had not taken off the creature's tail but left it on to serve by way of plume By that it was discovered in the quagmire and by that fished up When he had got it out he was obliged to wring it twenty times before it was in a state for travelling even under Jeffry's arm He also picked up my hat but not before the wind had made it cut a hundred capers this and that way in the air It lost however nothing by so many somersets on the contrary it got a comfortable coat which though all the brushes of the house have frequently been exercised upon it nevertheless it still retains and seems determined to retain in spite of their beards  After we were once again prepared for motion forward and affairs about us in their former order we proceeded to philosophize upon these accidents but after having tried to do so in a very serious strain we fancied the best method was to take the affair more gaily My papa drew consolation from his purse to give the coachman and on my side as I observed Jeffry in pain about his furcap only since the livery was his master's property I tipped him such a wink as restored him to a better temper After which we all went forward just as if no accident had happened  We were now come near a village when papa discerned an ancient soldier seated on a stone beside the road One leg was under him bent backward and the other a wooden one stuck out stiff before him A long crutch lay quietly upon his left and on his righthand sat a great black dog Papa who loves a soldier and particularly when that soldier is a cripple courteously saluted him and bade me fling a shilling to him which he gave me I fulfilled so honourable a commission in a very dexterous manner I may say without the least degree of  ostentation as I did not miss the hat The soldier's gratitude was uttered in so high a pitch that it sufficed to wake a sorry beggarwoman who lay sleeping not far off upon a little straw She trotted after us and reached the carriage just as we were ready to alight and put up at an inn "Ah sir" said she to my papa "how you bestow your charity and if you give it to an old drunkeu fellow what assistance will you afford an honest woman as I am who have not swallowed these ten years a glass of any liquor stronger than small beer"Papa whose mind was occupied on many subjects at that instant was not thinking of the invalid and viewed her with a visible astonishment "Yes yes sir" continued she "it is of that drunken soldier I am speaking Oh I heard how much he thanked you for the shilling which it seems you threw him by this little gentleman I would lay a wager that before night comes he will have spent it all in gin And then sir did not you remark the great black dog beside him as he sat A beggar keep a dog What is that but robbing other people who deserve assistance""Hold your tongue" said my papa and seemed quite angry "Why abuse a man at this rate who has no less need than you of my compassion If he drinks a little gin I can forgive an ancient soldier such a fault While we are seated at our ease before a good fire and even you are not without so great a comfort soldiers must endure the wind snow rain and every rigour of cold winter Where can be the wonder then if they should have recourse to what is sure to warm them and in time become accustomed to it And respecting his great dog perhaps that animal may be the only friend that he has his tried associate and the single creature who partakes of his bad days"When he had said these words he held out twopence without looking at her She received them with a kind of soorn and went off grumbling all the way as long as we could hear her speak The illnatured wretch had made me angry "I am very sorry sir" said I "that you gave her any thing She must be sure a very horrid creature to abuse a poor old soldier and be envious of the alms that you gave him""You are in the right" replied my father "He who wishes to excite my pity to another's detriment deserves my indignation only Yet I saw that she was in want and only upon that account  forgot her evil disposition It is punishment enough that she is reduced to beg Had she but kept her tongue in bounds I would have given her what the soldier had"  While we were thus discoursing with each other our host had shown us up into a room of which one window opened towards the road that we had been travelling and another towards a yard behind the house While they were getting dinner ready I stood looking out to mark the carriages that were continually going by and what can you imagine sister I beheld when I had hardly been a minute therethe beggarwoman who was now come back and had by  ime set herself upon a block beside the gateway She p  d out a little flasket full of brandy from her pocket and began to give a hearty pull I called out to papa  nd bade him come and see He told me not to speak lest we should be overheard We both looked at her and soon saw the soldier likewise coming down the road supported by his crutch and followed by the great black dog As soon as the old woman saw him hasting towards her she put up her flasket with the greatest haste into her pocket We were both of us the greatest haste into her pocket We were both of us curious to overhear their conversation "Mother" said the soldier who was now come pretty near her "do you mean to take a lodging here and have no dinner You are not hungry I suppose""Heaven help me" said the hypocrite and made as if she wept "I assure you my good friend I do not want for an appetite if I could but come at something good to eat I should not much mind what it was""If that be all" replied the generous soldier "I have sufficient for us both" On this he sat down by her slipped a knapsack from his shoulder and took out a lump of coarse brown bread together with a slice of cheese wrapt up in paper which he held out to the woman saying "There good woman help yourself" She did and pretty plentifully He put up with what was left though but a trifle and of this for every bit that he ate himself the large black dog had likewise his share who had assumed his place behind and all the while was resting in a very friendly way his head upon his master's shoulder  During their repast the hypocritical old woman turned her conversation on the unfeelingness of travellers adding that the gentleman who had but just before alighted from  his carriage and put up for dinner at the inn before them gave her only a poor halfpenny "That cannot be true" replied the honesthearted soldier "He must be a noble gentleman or certainly he had no money in his purse but gold which could not easily be changed See what he threw me by the little gentleman his sona shilling It is not always that pieces of this weight of metal tumble into my hat But do not you fret yourself for you shall be the better for my luck I cannot be happy by myself A good repast requires good liquor and I have not had a drop within my lips today although it is very late The truth is my poor money bag was so consumptive that I could easily have passed it through a needle's eye this morning but thank heaven at present it is quite plump and jolly so that I can well afford to lay out sixpence for us both Come good mother let me have your hand"  Saying thus he rose much in spirits and quite jovial The old woman took upon her the attendant's part and officiously held him out his crutch caressing now and then the dog I could have found it in my heart to beat the wretch for this dissembled friendship They walked up together to the house and entered at the gateway while on our part we above stairs shifted ground and hastened towards the other window which looked out into the yard We heard the soldier call for a gill of brandy with two little glasses one of which he filled and gave the woman who made haste and swallowed it immediately Papa could not restrain his indignation any longer "Out on such a hateful creature" cried heThey both lifted up their heads The woman recollecting us that moment gave a shriek but on the contrary the soldier was not disconcerted "See" said he "good sir how we are making merry through your bounty Let me drink your health" continued he and took his hat off "with the gentleman your son's I never forget any one however little that is but generously disposed""Much good may the liquor do you my worthy fellow" answered my papa "I like your spirit However poor you are you can oblige so here is a trifle more to strengthen your remembrance of us" throwing him a halfcrown piece "But as for all those wretches that can first abuse an honest fellow and then drink his liquor just as if it were their own"  The wretch would hear no more hung down her head and in confusion sneaked away  While we were both at dinner the landlord informed us that the honest soldier whose name was Trim had been a long while in the service that he had not quitted it before he lost his leg and had the friendship and esteem of all his officers "It is he" continued the host "who keeps up peace and order in the village since his soldierlike appearance awes the vagabonds about us Every body would be glad to give him victuals if he would but take their bounty but he never will accept of any thing that he has not earned by some good service or another as by going upon errands which he does with no less expedition than fidelity I should have put him in a passion had I even refused to take his money for the gill of brandy He asserts that I ought to live by what I get in trade whoever are my customers and says that if I gave him any thing I should be then obliged to charge it elsewhere which would be unjust As regularly as the morning comes he goes out loaded with a basket full of flints upon his shoulder and fills up the holes that have been made the day before along the road You must have noticed in what admirable order it appeared He never asks for any thing but there is scarce a traveller accustomed to the road who does not throw him something as he passes by He takes it without any hesitation as he thinks that he has deserved it This is his employ all summer and in winter when the weather is at the coldest he fills up his time in making children's wooden clog  for which he takes up his seat in my kitchen chimney He generously gives these clogs to those whose parents are so poor that they cannot pay his price lest they should happen to catch cold The only recompense that he asks of them for this trouble is to see them dance before him"  Well sister what are your thoughts of this goodhearted Trim This last particular in his story gave me so much pleasure that I ordered a pair immediately for you which I shall take when I return As you are far too generous and besides too di  nt to discharge the value of the clogs in capers I have engaged myself as you would do to pay him for them in hard money I design to give him halfacrown and then the clogs will  be much worthier of you They will not be useless if you mean to run about at any time next winter in the garden  If I did not apprehend that my journal had already tired your patience I should have a great deal more to mention I would tell you how as we were going on I terminated an important matter in a way which Don Quixote celebrated as he was for bravery would never have thought of You will suppose perhaps that after such a preface there was an inchanter or at least a giant in the case or some illustrious princess to deliver or some great kingdom to be recovered by conquest It was nothing of all this It was no other than a little girl who was tending a cow and a boy engaged in the same office with an ass who were struggling with each other for an apple which the former had found After having very gravely taken all the necessary information of their quarrel I took up as you may guess the weaker party and defended her but not in more than words since fortunately for the stronger I had neither lance nor shield or rather to confess a truth because even though I had he was of a size to thrash my knighthood soundly I perceived immediately that the moderation of a Solomon or a Titus suited much better with my inferiority of size and therefore I adjusted the affair in contest to the satisfaction of both combatants by sharing equally between them the remainder of that tart which you know the cook had made me that I might not faint with hunger by the way  I might go on and tell you of the pitiable fortune of a hare that we saw running across the country followed by a pack of hounds and huntsmen The poor creature after having often thrown them out as is the phrase with sportsmen by her doublings on the open plain had crimbed a pointed rock A furious dog perceived her in this last retreat and had the audacity to force her I beheld them both roll down the precipice together miserably mangledBut this picture is much too cruel is it not JessicaLet me therefore touch on themes more p  ing and inform you of the joy that our unexpected coming here gave every one belonging to the house If your dry jokes had not for ever undeceived me on the subject of my own exclusive merit I should think myself a cleverer fellow from the hearty welcome that we received It is much more modest in me to suppose myself  indebted for that welcome to the recollection of your visit here which they have cherished ever since last year I do suppose it and place all my boast in thanking you for having laid the groundwork of the entertainment that I am now experiencing  And thus dear sister I have sent you a recital of my wonderful adventures which perhaps you will think too tedious The most perilous of every circumstance attending them was when to give you some amusement I engaged to put them down in black and white I thought that I never should have come to the conclusion of my task I will not boast of any merit in the execution of my great undertaking and yet I please myself with thinking that you will owe my kindness something when you come to be acquainted that at present they have been ringing for me these ten minutes to come down and eat some fritters which are growing cold while I myself am hard at work in winding up my letter I can hardly fancy that the heroism of fraternal love ever yet went much farther than I have pushed it in this single instance for your sake  Adieu dear sister I will divert myself as much as possible for your sake rather than my own that at the time of my return I may present myself before you so much the more merryhearted I cannot tell what you may think of this but I for my part think that you should look upon it as a proof of the tenderness of that attachment with which I am dear sister yours  Dormer Lennox  LETTER VI  From Jessica to Dormer  Dear brother  I HAVE often heard that nothing forms the understanding so effectually as travelling and your narrative supplies me with a proof of the assertion which I did not in the least expect for who would ever think that such a little animal as you should think of being a philosopher for having travelled eighteen miles You told me in your first epistle that you designed the Journal of your Travels for posterity Whenever therefore you think fit to send it as directed I will take upon me to comp  ete such sketches as are fit to bear it company which I will get corrected by my drawingmaster For example our solemn coachman who without once changing place gets hold of his  great coat and lugs it by the sleeve poor Jeffry rising solemnly and slowly from his quagmire and my giddyheaded brother quite uncovered at the chariotdoor and with his eyes pursuing the poor hat in all its evolutions Here are three droll figures while papa still faithful to his character for prudence shall be represented as in contrast seizing on the coachman's reins to stop his horses You do not think that I shall forget the ancient soldier and old woman dining on the block Oh how I shall strive to set off to the best advantage honest Trim together with his great black dog that ate so amicably leaning on his shoulder Finally I will terminate my gallery with the scene betwixt your girl with the cow and your boy tending the ass not forgetting to d  scribe you as you represent yourself considering gravely of their quarrel and accommodating matters with the fragments of an appletart It is true I shall not write at the top the name of either Solomon or Titus which your usual modesty without the least demur lays claim to I have thought of one more proper namely Sancho Panca as I hardly ever knew in all my life a person of more understanding  I suppose you will not wish to be behindhand with me therefore I give up the account of my adventures to you in perusing which you will with ease suggest sufficient subjects to your own imagination for a set of pictures no less interesting I believe than those which from perusing your atchievements I have suggested as you see to mine  I had nearly forgot to return you my thanks for ordering me the pair of clogs My purse will not allow me to repay you the immense expence of so magnificent a present therefore you will let me satisfy you for it as the little children pay Trim I am learning a new caper for that purposeI am infinitely touched at your superior generosity in letting pass no opportunities of recreation for my sake and beg you to believe that my sensibility will naturally bid me do the like  Adieu my dear Dorme  As I take it we are a match for one another in joking I only wish to go beyond you in the boast of tender friendship as becomes  Your sister and your friend  Jessica Lennox  FINIS
