Come not here your Candour to implore  For Scenes whose Author is alas no more  He wants no Advocate his Cause to plead  You will yourselves be Patrons of the Dead  No Party his Benevolence confin'd  No Sectalike it flow'd to all Mankind  He lov'd his Friends forgive this gushing Tear  Alas I feel I am no Actor here  He lov'd his Friends with such a Warmth of Heart  So clear of Int'rest so devoid of Art  Such generous Freedom such unshaken Zeal  No Words can speak it but our Tears may tell  O candid Truth O Faith without a Stain  O Manners gently firm and nobly plain  O sympathizing Love of others Bliss  Where will you find another Breast like His  Such was the Manthe Poet well you know  Oft has he touch'd your Hearts with tender Woe  Oft in this crouded House with just Applause  You heard him teach fair Virtue's purest Laws  For his chaste Muse employ'd her Heav'ntaught Lyre  None but the noblest Passions to inspire  Not one immoral one corrupted Thought  One Line which dying he could wish to blot  Oh may Tonight your favourable Doom  Another Laurel add to grace his Tomb  Whilst he superior now to Praise or Blame  Hears net the feeble Voice of Human Fame  Yet if to those whom most on Earth he lov'd  From whom his pious Care is now remov'd  With whom his liberal Hand and bounteous Heart  Shar'd all his little Fortune could impart  If to those Friends your kind Regard shall give  What they no longer can from His receive  That that even now above yon starry Pole  May touch with Pleasure his immortal Soul  CORIOLANUS A TRAGEDY  ACT I SCENE I  The Volscian Camp  ATTIUS TULLUS VOLUSIUS  VOLUSIUS  WHENCE is it TULLUS that our Arms are stopt  Here on the Borders of the  Roman  State  Why sleeps that Spirit whose Heroic Ardour  Urg'dy ou to break the Truce and pour'd our Host  From all th'united Cantons of the  Volsci  On their unguarded Frontier Such Designs  Brook rot an Hour's Delay their whole Success  Depends on instant vigorous Execution  TULLUS  VOLUSIUS I approve thy brave Impatience  And will to thee in Confidence of Friendship  Disclose my secret Soul Thou know'st GALESUS  Whose Freedom  CAIUS MARCIUS  once his Guest  Of all the Spoil of sack'd  Corioli  Alone demanded and who thence to  Rome  From Gratitude and Friendship follow'd MARCIUS  Whence lately to our  Antium  he return'd  With Overtures of Peace propos'd by  Rome  VOLUSIUS  I know him well an antiquated Sage  Of that romantic School  Pythagoras  Establish'd here on our  Hesperian  Shore  Whose gentle Dictates only serve to tame  Enfeebled Mortals into Slaves  TULLUS  GALESUS  Doubtless possesses many civil Virtues  Is gentle good for Rectitude of Heart  And Innocence of Life by all rever'd  VOLUSIUS  Pardon me TULLUS if my faithful Bluntness  Deems you too lib'ral in his Praise In Peace  Such may perhaps do well when Prating rules  An idle World but in tempestuous Times  They are stark naught these visionary Statesmen  Fit Rulers only for their golden Age  The rugged Genius of rapacious  Rome  For other Men and other Counsels calls  TULLUS  Your Thoughts are mineI only meant to tell thee  The Part he bears in this illtim'd Delay  Soon as our gather'd Army march'd from  Antium  The  Roman  Senate whose attentive Caution  Watch'd all our Motions took at once th' Alarm  And sent a Herald ere we past their Borders  With formal Ceremony to demand  The Cause of our ApproachHad I been Master  I would have answer'd at the Gates of  Rome  But this GALESUS who attends our Camp  Among the  Volscian  Deputies so pleaded  The Laws of Nations made such loud Complaints  Against th' Infraction of the Publick Faith  So teaz'd us with the Pedantry of States  That I was forc'd unwilling to permit  His Freedman TITUS to be sent to  Rome  With our Demands If these the Senate grants  We then are in the Toils of Peace entangled  In spite of all my Efforts to avoid them  VOLUSIUS  O 'tis a wild Chimera Peace with  Rome  Dream not of that unless die  Volscian  Courage  Be quite subdu'd and only seeks to gild  A vile Submission with that specious Name  Learn Wisdom from your Neighbours Peace with  Rome  Has quell'd the  Latines  tam'd their freeborn Spirit  And by her Friendship honour'd them with Chains  TULLUS  She ne'er will grant it on the just Conditions  I now have brought the  Volsci  to demand  The Restitution of our conquer'd Cities  And fair Alliance upon equal Terms  I know the  Roman  Insolence will scorn  To yield to this and TITUS must return  Within three Days the longest Term allow'd him  Of which the Third is near elaps'd already  Then even GALESUS will not dare to stop us  With superstitious Forms and solemn Trisles  From letting loose th'unbridled Rage of War  Against those hated Tyrants of  Hesperia  VOLUSIUS  Thanks to the Gods my Sword will then be free  Then poor  Corioli  thy bleeding Wounds  Thy Treasures sack'd thy captivated Matrons  Shall amply be reveng'd by thy VOLUSIUS  Then TULLUS from the losty Brows of MARCIUS  Thou may'st regain the wreaths his conquering hand  By partial Fortune aided tore from thine  TULLUS  O my VOLUSIUS thou who art a Soldier  A try'd and brave one too say in thy Heart  Dost thou not scorn me thou who saw'st me bend  Beneath the halfspent Thunder of a Foe  Warm from the Conquest of  Corioli  Which rushing furious in with those whose Sally  He had repell'd he feiz'd almost alone  And gave to Fire and Sword Yet thence he flew  Scorning the Plunder of our richest City  His Wounds undrest without a Moment's Respite  To where our Armies on the fearful Edge  Of Battle stflood and asking of the Consul  To be oppos'd to me with mighty Rage  Resistless bore us down  VOLUSIUS  True Valour TULLUS  Lies in the Mind the neveryielding Purpose  Nor owns the blind Award of giddy Fortune  TULLUS  My Soul my Friend my Soul is all on Fire  Thirst of Revenge consumes me the Revenge  Of generous Emulation not of Hatred  This happy  Roman  this proud MARCIUS haunts me  Each troubled Night when Slaves and Captives sleep  Forgetful of their Chains I in my Dreams  Anew am vanquish'd and beneath his Sword  With Horror sinking feel a tenfold Death  The Death of Honour But I will redeem  Yes MARCIUS I will yet redeem my Fame  To face thee once again is the great Purpose  For which alone I liveTill then how slow  How tedious lags the Time while Shame corrodes me  With many a bitter Thought and injur'd Honour  Sick and desponding preys upon itself  VOLUSIUS  It fast approaches now the Hour of Vengeance  To this fam'd Land to ancient  Latium  due  Unballanc'd  Rome  at Variance with herself  To Order lost in deep and hot Commotion  Stands on the dangerous Point of civil War  Her haughty Nobles and seditious Commons  Reviling fearing hating one another  While on our part all wears a prosperous Face  Our Troops united numerous high in Spirit  As if their Gen'ral's Soul inform'd them all  O longexpected Day  TULLUS  Go brave VOLUSIUS  Go breathe thy Ardour into every Breast  That when the  Volscian  Envoy shall return  Whom ere the Close of Evening I expect  One Spirit may unite us in the Cause  Of generous Freedom and our native Rights  So long opprest by  Rome's  encroaching Power  SCENE II  TULLUS alone  GALESUS said that MARCIUS stands for Consul  O favour thou his suit propitious  Jove  That I may brave him at his Army's Head  In all the Majesty of sovereign Pow'r  That the whole Conduct of the War may rest  Oh us alone and prove by its Decision  Which of the two is worthiest to command  SCENE III  TULLUS OFFICER  TULLUS  Ha why this Haste you look alarm'd  OFFICER  My Lord  One of exalted Port his Visage hid  Has plac'd himself upon your sacred Hearth  Beneath the dread Protection of your  Lares  And sits majestic there in solemn Silence  TULLUS  Did you not ask him who and what he was  OFFICER  My Lord I could not speak I felt appall'd  As if the Presence of some God had struck me  TULLUS  Come Dastard let me find this Man of Terrors  SCENE IV  The back Scene opens and discovers CORIOLANUS as described above  CORIOLANUS TULLUS  TULLUS after some Silence  Illustrious Strangerfor thy high Demeanour  Bespeaks thee suchwho art thou  CORIOLANUS  Rising and unmuffling his Face  View me TULLUS  After some pause  Dost thou not know me  TULLUS  No That noble Front  I never saw before What is thy Name  CORIOLANUS  Does not the secret Voice of hostile Instinct  Does not thy swelling Heart declare me to thee  TULLUS  Gods can it be  CORIOLANUS  Yes I am CAIUS MARCIUS  Known to thy smarting Country by the Name  Of CORIOLANUS That alone is left me  That empty Name for all my Toils my Service  The Blood which I have shed for thankless  Rome  Behold me banish'd thence a Victim yielded  By her weak Nobles to the maddening Rabble  I seek Revenge Thou may'st employ my Sword  With keener Edge with heavier Force against her  Than e'er it fell upon the  Volscian  Nation  But if thou TULLUS dost refuse me this  The only Wish of my collected Heart  Where every Passion in one burning Point  Concenters give me Death Death from thy Hand  I sure have well deserv'dNor shall I blush  To take or Life or Death from ATTIUS TULLUS  TULLUS  O CAIUS MARCIUS in this one short Moment  That we have friendly talk'd my ravish'd Heart  Has undergone a great a wonderous Change  I ever held thee in my best Esteem  But this Heroic Confidence has won me  Stampt me at once thy Friend I were indeed  A Wretch as mean as this thy Trust is noble  Could I refuse thee thy DemandYes MARCIUS  Thou hast thy Wish take half of my Command  If that be not enough then take the whole  We have my Friend a gallant Force on Foot  An Army MARCIUS fit to follow thee  Go lead them on and take thy full Revenge  All should unite to punish the Ungrateful  Ingratitude is Treason to Mankind  CORIOLANUS embracing him  Thus generous TULLUS take a Soldier's Thanks  Who is not practis'd in the Gloss of Words  Thou Friend indeed Friend to my Cause my Quarrel  Friend to the darling Passion of my Soul  All else I set at noughtImmortal Gods  I am newmade and wonder at myself  A little while ago and I was nothing  A powerless Reptile crawling on the Earth  Curs'd with a Soul that restless wish'd to wield  The Bolts of  Jove  I dwelt in  Erebus  I wander'd through the hopeless Glooms of Hell  Stung with Revenge tormented by the Furies  Now TULLUS like a God you draw me thence  Throne me amidst the Skies with Tempest charg'd  And put the ready Thunder in my Hand  TULLUS  What I have promis'd MARCIUS I will do  Within an Hour at farthest we expect  The Freedman of GALESUS back from  Rome  Who carry'd to the Senate our Demands  Their Answer will I doubt not end the Truce  And instant draw our angry Swords against them  Till then retire within my inmost Tent  Unknown to all but me that when our Chiefs  Meet in full Council to declare for War  I may produce thee to their wondering Eyes  As if descended from avenging Heaven  To humble lofty  Rome  and teach her Justice  CORIOLANUS  To thy Direction TULLUS I resign  My future Life my Fate is in thy Hands  And if I judge aright the Fate of  Rome  The End of the First  ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  GALESUS TITUS  GALESUS  INDEED my TITUS I had Hopes that  Rome  Vext as she is with her domestic Broils  Her Frontier weak her Armies unprepar'd  Might have comply'd with our Demands and given us  The same Alliance granted to the  Latines  TITUS  The Senate scarce would hear the Terms I offer'd  But order'd me to bear this Answer back  "If first the  Volsci  take up Arms the  Romans  "Will be the last to lay them down"  GALESUS  Alas  This Answer seals the Doom of many a Wretch  Unchain'd  Bellona  from her Temple rushes  With all the Crimes and Vices in her Train  Earth fades at her Approach To rural Peace  Fair Plenty and the social Joy of Cities  Soon will succeed Rage Rapine Devastation  Each cruel Horror sanctify'd by Names  O Mortals Mortals when will you content  With Nature's Bounty that in fuller Flow  Still as your Labours open more its Sources  Abundant gushes o'er the happy World  When will you banish Violence and Outrage  To dwell with Beasts of Prey in Woods and Desarts  TITUS  Never till  Rome  shall change her conquering Maxims  GALESUS  Her haughty Spirit now will soar beyond  Its usual Pitch upborne by CAIUS MARCIUS  Stands he not for the Consulate  TITUS  He did  But is no more a Citizen of  Rome  GALESUS  What mean'st thou TITUS  TITUS  MARCIUS is from  Rome  Banish'd for ever  GALESUS  O immortal Powers  On what Pretence could they to Exile doom  Their wisest Captain and their bravest Soldier  Nor less renown'd for Piety for Justice  An uncorrupted Heart and purest Manners  TITUS  The Charge against him was entirely groundless  What not his Enemies themselves believ'd  Affecting of tyrannic Power in  Rome  His real Crime was only some hot Words  Struck from his fiery Temper in the Senate  Against those factious Ministers of Discord  The Tribunes of the People They to Rage  And frantic Fury rous'd the mad Plebeians  By whom supported in their bold Attempt  They durst presume to summon to the Bar  Of an enrag'd and partial Populace  The most illustrious Senator of  Rome  To this the Nobles yieldedand with his  Gave up their own and Childrens Rights for ever  GALESUS  O shameful Weakness in a  Roman  Senate  So much renown'd for Firmness Yet my TITUS  Spite of my Love to MARCIUS I must own it  The vigorous Soil whence his Heroic Virtues  Luxuriant rise if not with careful Hand  Severely weeded teems with Imperfections  His lofty Spirit brooks no Opposition  His Rage if once offended knows no Bounds  He deems Plebeians with Patrician Blood  Compar'd the Creatures of a lower Species  Mere menial Hands by Nature meant to serve him  TITUS  It was this high Patrician Pride undid him  The furious People triumph'd in his Ruin  As if they had expell'd another  Tarquin  While like a captive Train the vanquish'd Nobles  Hung their dejected Heads in silent Shame  MARCIUS alone seem'd unconcern'd tho' deep  The latent Tempest boil'd within his Breast  Choak'd up and smother'd with excessive Rage  GALESUS  You were his Guest at  Rome  and therefore TITUS  Might on this sad Occasion be permitted  To join your Tears with his domestic Friends  Saw you that moving Scene  TITUS  I did GALESUS  I follow'd MARCIUS homeHis Mother there  VETURIA the most venerable Matron  These Eyes have e'er beheld and soft VOLUMNIA  His lovely virtuous Wife amidst his Children  Spread on the Ground lay lost in dumb Despair  He swelling stood a while and could not speak  Th'affronted Hero struggling with the Man  Then thus at last he broke the gloomy Silence  "'Tis done The guilty Sentence is pronounc'd  "Ungrateful  Rome  has cast me from her Bosom  "Support this Blow with Fortitude and Courage  "As it becomes two generous  Roman  Matrons  "I recommend my Children to your Care  "Farewel I go I quit without Regret  "A City grown an Enemy to Virtue"  GALESUS  Oh godlike MARCIUS oh unconquer'd Strength  And Dignity of Mind How much superior  Is such a Soul to all the Power of Fortune  TITUS  This said he sternly try'd to break away  When holding in her Hand his eldest Son  VETURIA follow'd while the poor VOLUMNIA  All drown'd in Tears and bearing in one Arm  Their youngest yet an Infant with the other  Hung clinging at his Kneeshe turning to them  Half soften'd half severe breath'd from his Soul  These broken Accents"Cease your vain Complaints  "Mother you have no more a Son and thou  "Thou best of Women thou my dear VOLUMNIA  "No more a Husband"Pierc'd with these dire Words  VOLUMNIA lifeless sunk and off he flung  With wild Precipitation  GALESUS  Thy sad Tale  Blinds my old Eyes with TearsBut whither tell me  O whither TITUS bent he then his Course  TITUS  Where the blind Genius of regardless Rage  And Desperation led On to the Gate  Capena  call'd attended by the Nobles  He stalk'd in sullen Majesty along  Nor deign'd a Word A godlike virtuous Anger  Beam'd thro' his Features and sublim'd his Air  With downcast Eyes he walk'd or if aside  He chanc'd to look each Look was great Reproach  Thus in emphatic Silence that made Words  Void and insipid all he parted from them  The Day preceding my Return from  Rome  Nor has been heard of since lost in th'Abyss  Of his own Woes  GALESUS  O MARCIUS noble MARCIUS  How shall my Friendship succour thy Distress  Where shall I find thee to partake thy Sorrows  And make myself Companion of thy Exile  But TITUS we indulge Discourse too long  Go and assemble thou the  Volscian  Chiefs  Whilst I repair to TULLUS to inform  And bring him to the Council there to hear  The fatal Answer thou hast brought from  Rome  SCENE II  Changes to TULLUS'S Tent  CORIOLANUS TULLUS  CORIOLANUS  Forgive me TULLUS if I count the Moments  That stop the Purpose of thy noble Kindness  And keep me here confin'd in tame Inaction  Why lingers TITUS  TULLUS  Calm thy restless Heart  Brave MARCIUS every Minute I expect him  Soon from the Cloud that hides thee shalt thou break  With double Brightness soon thy firey Rage  Shall wither all the Strength and Pride of  Rome  CORIOLANUS  O righteous  Jove  Protector of the Injur'd  If from my earliest Youth with pious Awe  I still have reverenc'd thy allpowerful Justice  Still by her sacred Dictates rul'd my Actions  O let that Justice now support my Cause  And arm my strong Righthand with all her Terrors  When that is done be Life or Death my Lot  As thy almighty Pleasure shall determine  Enter an Officer to  TULLUS  OFFICER  My Lord GALESUS asks Admittance to you  TULLUS  MARCIUS retire an Instant till I hear  The Business brings him hitherBid him enter  Exit Officer and  CORIOLANUS  Enter  GALESUS  SCENE III  TULLUS GALESUS  GALESUS  TULLUS the  Roman  Senate has return'd  No other Answer to our late Demands  But absolute Denial and Defiance  TULLUS  It is what I expectedWe shall teach them  An humbler Language soonHast thou assembled  As I desir'd the  Volscian  Chiefs in Council  GALESUS  TITUS is gone to summon their Attendance  TULLUS  It is enoughCome forth my noble Guest  And shew GALESUS how the Gods assist us  SCENE IV  CORIOLANUS TULLUS GALESUS  GALESUS  O My astonish'd Soul what do I see  What  CAIUS MARCIUS CAIUS MARCIUS  here  Beneath one Tent with TULLUS  TULLUS  Ay and more  With TULLUS now his Friend and fellow Soldier  Yes thou shalt see him thundering at the Head  Of  Volscian  Armies he who oft has carry'd  Destruction thro' their RanksYour Leave a Moment  While to our Chiefs and Fathers I announce  Their unexpected Guest  SCENE V  CORIOLANUS GALESUS  CORIOLANUS  Thou good old Man  Close let me strain thee to my faithful Heart  Which now is doubly thine united more  By the Protection which thy Country gives me  Than by our former Friendship  GALESUS  Strange Event  This is thy Work almighty Providence  Whose Power beyond the Stretch of human Thought  Revolves the Orbs of Empire bids them sink  Deep in the deadning Night of thy Displeasure  Or rise majestic o'er a wondering World  The Gods by theeI see it CORIOLANUS  Mean to exalt us and depress the  Romans  CORIOLANUS  GALESUS yes the Gods have sent me hither  Those righteous Gods who when vindictive Justice  Excites them to destroy a worthless People  Make their own Crimes and Follies strike the Blow  GALESUS  Cherish these Thoughts that teach us what we are  And tame the Pride of Man There is a Power  Unseen that rules th'illimitable World  That guides its Motions from the brightest Star  To the least Dust of this sintainted Mold  While Man who madly deems himself the Lord  Of all is nought but Weakness and Dependance  This sacred Truths by sure Experience taught  Thou must have learnt when wandering all alone  Each Bird each Insect flitting thro' the Sky  Was more sufficient for itself than thou  Ah the full Image of thy Woes dissolves me  The Pangs that must have torn at parting from thee  Thy Mother and thy Wife I cannot think  Of that sad Scene without some Drops of Pity  CORIOLANUS  Who was it forc'd me to that bitter Parting  Who in one cruel hasty Moment chas'd me  From Wife from Children Friends and Houshold Gods  Me who so often had protected theirs  Who from the sacred City of my Fathers  Drove me with Nature's Commoners to dwell  To lodge beneath their wide unshelter'd Roof  And at their Table feed O blast me Gods  With ev'ry Woe Debility of Mind  Dishonour just Contempt and palsy'd Weakness  If I forgive the Villains yes GALESUS  Yes I will offer to the Powers of Vengeance  A great a glorious Victima whole City  Why TULLUS this Delay  GALESUS  May CORIOLANUS  Be to the  Volscian  Nation and himself  The dread the godlike Instrument of Justice  But let not Rage and Vengeance mix their Rancour  Let them not trouble with their fretful Storm  Their angry Gleams that Azure where enthron'd  The calm Divinity of Justice sits  And pities while she punishes Mankind  CORIOLANUS  What saidst thou What against the Powers of Vengeance  The Gods gave honest Anger just Revenge  To be the awful Guardians of the Rights  And native Dignity of Human kind  O were it not for them the saucy World  Would grow a noisome Nest of little Tyrants  Each Carrion Crow on Eagle Merit perch'd  Would peck his Eyes out and the mungril Cur  At pleasure bait the LyonNo GALESUS  I would not rashly nor on light Occasion  Receive the deep Impression in my Breast  But when the Base the Brutal and Unjust  Or worse than all th' Ungrateful stamp it there  O I will then with Luxury supreme  Enjoy the Pleasure of offended Gods  A righteous just RevengeBehold my Soul  Enter an Officer  OFFICER  My Lords th'assembled Chiefs desire your Presence  GALESUS  Come noble MARCIUS let My joyful Hand  Conduct thee thitherDoubt not thy Reception  Will be proportion'd to thy Fame and Merit  SCENE VI  The back Scene opens and discovers the Deputies of the  Volscian  States assembled in Council They rise and salute  CORIOLANUS  then resume their Places  GALESUS TULLUS CORIOLANUS SENATORS  GALESUS  Assembled States and Captains of the  Volsci  Behold the Chief so much renown'd in War  Our once so formidable Foe but now  Our proffer'd Friend and SoldierCAIUS MARCIUS    st  SENATOR  We give him hearty Welcome from our Souls  CORIOLANUS  Most noble Chiefs and Fathers of the  Volsci  I need not say how by the People's Rage  And the poor Weakness of the timid Nobles  I am expell'd from  Rome  Had I confin'd  My Wishes merely to a safe Retreat  Some  Latine  City might have given me that  Or any nameless Corner What imports it  Where a tame patient Exile rots in Silence  But  Volscian  Lords permit me to declare  I would at once cut short my useless Days  Rather than be that despicable Wretch  Who neither can take Vengeance on his Foes  Nor serve his Friends That is my Temper Chiefs  I shall be glad to merit by my Sword  Th'Asylum which I seek among the  Volsci  Rome  is our common Foe Then let us join  Our common Suffering Passions and Resentments  Yes tho' but one I bring so many Wrongs  So large a Share of powerful Enmity  Into the War as gives me the Presumption  To offer to the  Volscian  States th'Alliance  Even of my single Arm  TULLUS  That single Arm  Is in itself a numerous Army MARCIUS  The  Volscians  so esteem itBut proceed  CORIOLANUS  I will not mention  Volscian  Chiefs what Talent  The World allows me to possess in War  But be it what it will you may employ it  Soldier or Captain in whatever Station  You place me I will lose each Drop of Blood  Or with this Hand I'll fix the  Volscian  Standard  On the proud Towers of Capitolian  Jove  TULLUS  Chiefs of the  Volscian  League I give you Joy  Of our new Citizen the noble MARCIUS  The Genius of the  Volscian  State has sent him  Whetted by Wrongs into a keener Hatred  Than that we bear to  Rome  It were contemning  With impious selfsufficient Arrogance  This Bounty of the Gods not to accept  With every Mark of Honour of his Service  I  Volscians  I even ATTIUS TULLUS give  First of you all my Voice that CAIUS MARCIUS  Be now receiv'd to high Command among us  That instantly we do appoint him General  Of half our Troops which here with your Consent  I to him yieldSpeak Chiefs is this your Pleasure    st  SENATOR  It isWe give unanimous Consent  TULLUS embracing him  MARCIUS I joy to call thee my Companion  And Collegue in this War  CORIOLANUS  By all the Gods  Thou art the generous Victor of my Soul  Yes TULLUS I am conquer'd by thy Virtue  GALESUS  Tho' I have oft on great Occasions TULLUS  Beheld thee in the Senate and the Field  Cover'd with Glory yet I must avow  I never saw thee shew such genuine Greatness  Such true Sublimity of Soul as now  To scorn th' allpowerful Charm of selfish Passions  Chiefly the dazzling Pride of Emulation  That noble Weakness of Heroic Minds  To sink thyself that thou may'st raise thy Country  To put the Sword into thy Rival's Hand  And twine thy promis'd Laurels round his Brow  O 'tis a Flight beyond the highest Point  Of Martial Glory and what few can reach  Go forth the chosen Ministers of Justice  And may that awful Power whose secret Hand  Sways all our Passions turns our partial Views  All to its own dread Purposes attend you  CORIOLANUS  I burn to enter on the glorious Task  You now have mark'd me out How slow the Time  To the warm Soul that in the very Instant  It forms would execute a great Design  'Tis my Advice we march direct to  Rome  We cannot be too quick Let the first Dawn  See us in bright Array before her Walls  Perhaps when they behold their Exile there  Back'd by your Force some conscious Hearts among them  May feel th' Alarm of Guilt  TULLUS  I much approve  Of this Advice 'Tis what I thought before  Ere strengthen'd MARCIUS by thy mighty Arm  But now 'tis doubly right Here  Volscian  Chiefs  Here let our Council terminateThe Troops  Have had Repose sufficient Strait to  Rome  Come let us urge our MarchAs yet the Stars  Ride in their middle Watch we shall with Ease  Reach it by Dawn  CORIOLANUS  Yes we have timetoo much  Six tedious Hours till MornBut hence away  My Soul on Fire anticipates the Dawn  End of the Second  ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  CORIOLANUS TULLUS VOLUSIUS TITUS  with a Croud of  Volscian  Officers Acclamations behind the Scenes  CORIOLANUS  NO moreI merit not this lavish Praise  True we have driven the  Roman  Legions back  Defeated and disgrac'dBut what is this  Nothing ye  Volsci  nothing yet is done  We but begin the wonderous Leaf of Story  That marks the  Roman  Doom At length it dawns  The destin'd Hour that eases of their Fears  The Nations round and sets  Hesperia  free  Come on my brave Companions of the War  Come let us finish at one mighty Stroke  This Toil of labouring FateWe will or perish  While noble TULLUS you protect the Camp  I with my Troops all Men of chosen Valour  And wellapprov'd today will storm the City  TITUS  Beneath thy animating Conduct MARCIUS  What can the  Volscian  Valour not perform  Thy very Sight and Voice subdues the  Romans  When lifting up your Helm you shew'd your Face  That like a Comet glar'd Destruction on them  I saw their bravest Veterans fly before thee  Their ancient Spirit has with thee forsook them  And Ruin hangs o'er yon devoted Walls  Enter an Officer who addresses himself to  Coriolanus  OFFICER  My Lord a Herald is arriv'd from  Rome  To say a Deputation from the Senate  Attended by the Ministers of Heaven  A venerable Train of Priests and Flamens  Is on the Way address'd to you  CORIOLANUS  To me  What can this Message meanStand to your Arms  Ye  Volscian  Troops and let these  Romans  pass  Betwixt the lowring Frown of double Files  What do they think me such a milky Boy  To pay my Vengeance with a few soft Words  Come fellow Soldiers TULLUS come and see  If I betray the Honours you have done me  Goes out with a Train of  Volscian  Officers  SCENE II  TULLUS VOLUSIUS  who remain  VOLUSIUS  after some Silence  Are we not TULLUS failing in our Duty  Not to attend our General  TULLUS  How What saidst thou  VOLUSIUS  Methought my Lord his parting Orders were  We should attend the Triumph now preparing  O'er all his Foes at once  Romans  and  Volsci  Come we shall give Offence  TULLUS  Of this no more  I pray thee spare thy bitter Irony  VOLUSIUS  Shall I then speak without Disguise  TULLUS  Speak out  With all the honest Bluntness of a Friend  Think'st thou I fear the Truth  VOLUSIUS  Then TULLUS know  Thou art no more the General of the  Volsci  Thou hast by this thy generous Weakness sunk  Thyself into a private Man of  Antium  Yes thou hast taken from thy laurel'd Brow  The wellearn'd Trophies of thy Toils and Perils  Thy springing Hopes the fairest ever budded  And heap'd them on a Man too proud before  TULLUS  He bears it high  VOLUSIUS  Death and Perdition high  With uncontroul'd CommandYou see already  He will not be encumber'd with the Fetters  Of our Advice He speaks his Sovereign Will  On every Hand he issues out his Orders  As to his natural SlavesFor you my Lord  He has I think confin'd you to your Camp  There in inglorious Indolence to languish  While he beneath your blasted Eye shall reap  The Harvest of your Honour  TULLUS  No VOLUSIUS  Whatever Honour shall by him be gain'd  Reverts to me from whole superior Bounty  He drew the Means of all his glorious Deeds  This mighty Chief this Conqueror of  Rome  Is but my Creature  VOLUSIUS  Wretched SelfDelusion  He and the  Volscians  know he is thy Master  He acts as such in all ThingsNow by  Mars  Could my abhorrent Soul endure the Thought  Of stooping to a  Roman  Chief I here  Would leave thee in thy solitary Camp  And go where Glory calls  TULLUS  Indeed VOLUSIUS  I did expect more equal Treatment from him  But what of thatThe generous Pride of Virtue  Disdains to weigh too nicely the Returns  Her Bounty meets withLike the liberal Gods  From her own gracious Nature she bestows  Nor stoops to ask RewardYet must I own  I thought he would not have so soon forgot  What he so lately was and what I am  VOLUSIUS  Gods knew ye not his Character before  Did you not know his Genius was to yours  Averse as are Antipathies in Nature  High overweening tyranously Proud  And only fit to hold Command o'er Slaves  Hence as repugnant to that equal Life  Which is the quickening Soul of all Republicks  The  Roman  People cast him forth and we  Shall we receive the Bane of their Repose  Into our Breast Are we less free than they  Or shall we be more patient of a Tyrant  TULLUS  All this I knew But while his Imperfections  Are thy glad Theme thou hast forgot his Virtues  VOLUSIUS  I leave that Subject to the smooth GALESUS  And these his  Volscian  FlatterersHis Virtues  Trust me there is no Insolence that treads  So high as that which rears itself on Virtue  TULLUS  Well be it soI meant that even his Vices  Should on this great Occasion serve the  Volsci  VOLUSIUS  Confusion there it is there lurks the Sting  Of our Dishonour while this MARCIUS leads  The  Roman  Armies ours are driven before him  Behold he changes Sides when with him changes  The Fortune of the War Strait they grow  Volsci  And we victorious  Romans  Such no doubt  Such is his secret BoastAy this vile Brand  Success itself will fix for ever on us  And TULLUS thou 'tis thou must answer for it  TULLUS aside  His Words are Daggers to my Heart I feel  Their Truth but am asham'd to own my Folly  VOLUSIUS  O Shame O Infamy the Thought consumes me  It scalds my Eyes with Tears to see a  Roman  Borne on our Shoulders to immortal Fame  Just in the happy Moment that decided  The long Dispute of Ages that for which  Our generous Ancestors had toil'd and bled  To see him then step in and steal our Glory  O that we first had perish'd all A People  Who cannot find in their own proper Force  Their own Protection are not worth the saving  TULLUS  It must have Way I will no more suppress it  Know then my rough old Friend no less than thee  His Conduct hurts me and upbraids my Folly  I wake as from a Dream What Demon mov'd me  What doating Generosity his Woes  Was it his Woes to see the brave reduc'd  To trust his mortal Foe perhaps a little  That work'd within my BosomBut VOLUSIUS  That was not allI will to thee confess  The Weakness of my HeartYes it was Pride  The dazzling Pride to see my RivalWarriour  The great CORIOLANUS bend his Soul  His haughty Soul to sue for my Protection  Protection said I were it that alone  I had been base to have refus'd him that  To have refus'd him aught a gallant Foe  Owes to a gallant FoeBut to exalt him  To the same Level nay above myself  To yield him the Command of half my Troops  The choicest acting HalfThat that was Madness  Was weak was mean unworthy of a Man  VOLUSIUS  I scorn to flatter theeIt was indeed  TULLUS  Curse on the Slave GALESUS soothing he  Seiz'd the fond Moment of Infatuation  And clinch'd the Chains my generous Folly forg'd  How shall I from this Labyrinth escape  Must it then be what cruel Genius dooms me  In War or Peace to creep beneath his Fortune  VOLUSIUS  That Genius is thyself If thou canst bear  The very Thought of stooping to this  Roman  Thou from that Moment art his Vassal TULLUS  By that thou dost acknowledge Parent Nature  Has form'd him thy Superior But if fix'd  Upon the Base of manly Resolution  Thou say'stI will be free I will command  I and my Country thenO never doubt it  We shall find Means to crush this vain Intruder  Even I myselfthis Hand  Nay hear me TULLUS  'Tis not yet come to that that last Resource  I do not say we should employ the Dagger  While other better Means are in our Power  TULLUS  No my VOLUSIUS Fortune will not drive us  Or I am much deceiv'd to that Extreme  We shall not want the strongest fairest Plea  To give a solemn Sanction to his Fate  He will betray himself Whate'er his Rage  Of Passion talks a Weakness for his Country  Sticks in his Soul and he is still a  Roman  Soon shall we see him tempted to the Brink  Of this sure PrecipiceThen down at once  Without Remorse we hurl him to Perdition  But hark the Trumpet calls us to a Scene  I should detest if not from Hope we thence  May gather Matter to mature our Purpose  SCENE III  The back Scene opens and discovers  CORIOLANUS  sitting on his Tribunal attended by his Lictors and a Croud of  Volscian  Officers Files of Troops drawn up on either Hand In the Depth of the Scene appear the Deputies from the  Roman  Senate  M MINUCIUS POSTHUMUS COMINIUS SP LARTIUS P PINNARIUS  and  Q SULPITIUS  all Consular Senators who had been his most zealous Friends And behind them march the Priests the Sacrificers the Augurs and the Guardians of the sacred Things drest in their Ceremonial Habits These advance slowly betwixt the Files of Soldiers under Arms As  TULLUS  enters  CORIOLANUS  rising salutes him  CORIOLANUS  Here noble TULLUS sit and judge my Conduct  Nor spare to check me if I act amiss  TULLUS  MARCIUS the  Volscian  Fate is in thy Hands  CORIOLANUS  is seated again and  TULLUS  places himself upon a Tribunal on his Left Hand Mean time the  Roman  Deputies advance up to  CORIOLANUS  and salute him which he returns  CORIOLANUS  What  Romans  from the Generals of the  Volsci  Is your Demand  MINUCIUS  O CORIOLANUS  Rome  Nurse of thy tender Years thy ParentCity  Her Senators her People Priests and Augurs  Her every Order and Degree by us  Thy everzealous stillunshaken Friends  Sue in the most pathetic Terms for Peace  And if in This constrain'd We from our Maxim  Never to ask but give it must depart  It is some Consolation in the State  To which thou hast by thy superior Valour  Reduc'd us that we ask it from a  Roman  CORIOLANUS  I was a  Roman  once and thought the Name  Was hot dishonour'd by me but it pleas'd  Your Lords the Mob of  Rome  to take it from me  Nor will I now receive it back again  MILUCIUS  The Name thou mayst reject but canst not throw  The Duties from thee which that Name imports  Indissoluble Duties bound upon thee  By the strong Hand of Nature and confirm'd  By the dread Sanction of allruling  Jove  Then hear thy Country's supplicating Voice  By all those Duties I conjure thee hear us  CORIOLANUS  WellI will hear thee speak declare thy Message  MILUCIUS  Give Peace give healing Peace to two brave Nations  Fatigu'd with War arid sick of cruel Deeds  To carry on Destruction's easy Trade  Afflict Mankind and scourge the World with War  Is what each wicked each ambitious Man  Who lets his furious Passions loose may do  But in the flattering Torrent of Success  To check his Rage and drop th'avenging Sword  When a repenting People ask it of him  That is the genuine Bounty of a God  Then urge no further this your just Resentment  Which injur'd as you are you needs must feel  But never ought to carry into Action  Against your sacred Country whence you drew  Your Life your Virtues every mortal Good  That very Valour you employ against her  Stop CORIOLALUS ere beyond Retreat  You plunge yourself in Crimes To the fierce Joy  Of Vengeance push'd to barbarous Excess  Repentance will succeed and sickning Horror  Consider too the slippery State of Fortune  The Gods take Pleasure oft when haughty Mortals  On their own Pride erect a mighty Fabrick  By slightest means to lay their towering Schemes  Low in the Dust and teach them they are nothing  Return thou virtuous  Roman  to the Bosom  Of thy imploring Country Lo her Arms  She fondly spreads to take thee back again  And by redoubled Love efface her Harshness  Return and crown thee with the noblest Wreathe  Which Glory can bestowthe Palm of Mercy  CORIOLANUS  MARCUS MINUCIUS and ye other  Romans  Respected Senators and holy Flamens  Attend and take to your Demand this Answer  Why court you me the Servant of the  Volsci  It is to them that you must bend for Peace  Which on these only Terms they will accord you  "Restore the conquer'd Lands your former Wars  "Have ravish'd from them from their Towns an Cities  "Won by your Arms withdraw your Colonies  "And to the full Immunities of  Rome  "Frankly admit them as you have the  Latines  "  Then  Romans  you have Peace and not till then  If these are Terms which suit not your Ambition  They suit the State to which the  Volscian  Arms  Have now reduc'd youWe have learn'd from  Rome  To use our Fortune and command the Vanquish'd  TULLUS  aside  Death to my Hopes I'm now his Slave for ever  CORIOLANUS  addressing himself to the  Volsci  This my illustrious Patrons and Protectors  Volsci  to you I ow'd Permit me now  To do myself and injur'd Honour Justice  Turning again to the  Romans  As to the Liberty you idly vaunt  To give me of returning to your City  'Tis what I hold unworthy of Acceptance  Can I return into th' ungrateful Bosom  Of a distracted State where to the Rage  Of a vile senseless Populace the Laws  Are by your shameful Weakness given a Prey  Who are the Men that hold the Sway among you  And whom have you expell'd as even unworthy  To live within the Cincture of your Walls  O the wild Thought breaks in and troubles Reason  With what ye  Romans  can the sowerest Censor  The most envenom'd Malice justly charge me  Did I e'er break your Laws Nay did I e'er  Do aught that could disturb the sacred Order  The Peace and social Harmony of Life  Or taint your ancient Sanctity of Manners  What was my Crime I could not bear to see  Your Dignity debas'd to see the Rabble  Tread on the reverend grey Authority  Of Senatorial Wisdom Yes for you  In your Defence I did enrage this Monster  And yet you basely left me to its Fury  Then talk no more of Services and Friendship  A Friend who can and does not shield betrays me  Or if the Power was wanting then your Senate  Is sunk into Servility and Bondage  Nor should a Freeman deign to sit among you  MINUCIUS  The Wisest are sometimes compell'd to yield  To popular Storms Yet I defend not MARCIUS  Our timid Conduct we have felt our Error  And now invite thee back to aid the Senate  With thy heroic Spirit to restrain  The giddy Rage of Faction and to hold  The Reins of Government more firm hereafter  As to th' Appeal which thou hast nobly made  In Vindication of thy spotless Fame  With Pleasure we confirm it and bear Witness  To all thy public and thy private Virtues  But let us also beg thee not to stain  The Brightness of that Glory by a Crime  Which unrepented would disgrace them all  A dire rebellious War against thy Country  CORIOLANUS  Absurd What can you mean To call a People  Who with the last Indignity have us'd me  To call my Foes my Country No MINUCIUS  It is the generous Nation of the  Volsci  These brave these virtuous Men you see around me  Who when I wander'd a poor helpless Exile  Took Pity of my Injuries and Woes  Forgot the former Mischiefs of my Sword  Heap'd on me Kindness Honours Dignities  Fear'd not to trust me with this high Command  And plac'd me here the Guardian of their Cause  Be Witness  Jove  It is alone their Nation  I henceforth will acknowlege for my Country  Let this sufficeYou have my Answer ROMANS  COMINIUS  This Answer CORIOLANUS is the Dictate  More of thy Pride than Magnanimity  'Tis thy Revenge that gives it not thy Virtue  Art thou above the Gods who joy to show'r  Their doubled Goodness on repenting Mortals  But think not I intend by This to urge  Our proffer'd Peace so harshly treated further  That were a Weakness ill becoming  Romans  Yet I must tell thee it would better fuit  A fierce despotic Chief of barbarous Slaves  Than the calm Dignity of one who sits  In the grave Senate of a free Republic  To talk so high and as it were to thrust  Plebeians from the native Rights of Man  CORIOLANUS  Ha dost thou come the People's Advocate  To Me COMINIUS Com'st thou to insult me  COMINIUS  Nay hear me MARCIUSThese grey Hairs impower me  To set thee right before this great Assembly  And there was once a Time thou wouldst have heard  Thy General with more Deference and Patience  I tell thee then whoe'er amidst the Sons  Of Reason Valour Liberty and Virtue  Displays distinguish'd Merit is a Noble  Of Nature's own creating Such have risen  Sprung from the Dust or where had been our Honours  And such in radiant Bands will rise again  In yon immortal City that when most  Deprest by Fate and near apparent Ruin  Returns as with an Energy divine  On her astonish'd Foes and shakes them from her  Your Pardon VOLSCIBut This CORIOLANUS  Is what I had to say  CORIOLANUS  And I have heard it  Rising from his Tribunal and the Priests advancing to address him he prevents them  For you ye awful Ministers of Heaven  Let me not hear your holy Lips profan'd  By urging what my Duty must refuse  I bow in Adoration to the Gods  I venerate their Servants But there is  There is a Power their chief their darling Care  The Guardian of Mankind which to betray  Were violating allAnd that is JUSTICE  So far my public Character demands  So far my HonourNow what should forbid  The Man and Friend to be indulg'd a little  Permit me to embrace thee good MINUCIUS  Thee LARTIUS you PINNARIUS and SULPICIUS  But chiefly thee COMINIUS who first rais'd me  To Deeds of Arms who from thy Consolar Brow  Took thy own Crown and with it circled mine  Tho nought can shake my Purpose yet I wish  That  Rome  had sent me others on this Errand  I thank you for your Friendship The Protection  Which you have given to those whom once I call'd  By tender Names I would not now remember  How shall Isayreturn your generous Goodness  O there is nothing you as Friends can ask  My grateful Heart will not with Pleasure grant you  COMINIUS  We thank thee  CORIOLANUS  But a  Roman  Disdains that Favour you refuse his Country  CORIOLANUS  To the  Volscian  Officers  See that they be with due Regard and Safety  Conducted back  To the  Roman  Senators  I will suspend th' Assault  Till to these Terms of which we will not bate  The smallest Part your Senate may have Time  To send their latest Answer Then we cut  All further Treaty off  Romans  farewell  The End of the Third  ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  TULUS alone  WHAT is the Mind of Man A restless Scene  Of Vanity and Weakness shifting still  As shift the Lights of our uncertain Knowlege  Or as the various Gale of Passion breathes  None ever thought himself more deeply founded  On what is right nor felt a nobler Ardor  Than I when I invested CAIUS MARCIUS  With this illjudg'd Command Now it appears  Distraction Folly monstrous Folly Meanness  And down I plunge betray'd even by my Virtue  From Gulph to Gulph from Shame to deeper Shame  SCENE II  TULLUS GALESUS  GALESUS  I listen'd TULLUS to th' important Scene  That lately pass'd before us with most strict  Unprejudic'd Attention and have since  Revolv'd it in my Mind both as a Man  Allyd to all Mankind and as a  Volscian  Indeed our Terms are high and by the Manner  In which they were prescrib'd by CORIOLANUS  Are what we cannot hope will e'er be granted  They should be soften'd Let us yield a little  Conscious ourselves to a great Nation's Pride  The Pride of human Nature Could the  Romans  Stoop to such Peace commanded by the Sword  They then were Slaves unworthy our Alliance  TULLUS  Gods do I hear in thee one of the Chiefs  Intrusted with the Honour of the  Volsci  An Advocate for  Rome  GALESUS  I glory TULLUS  To own myself an Advocate for Peace  Peace is the happy natural State of Man  War his Corruption his Disgrace  TULLUS  His Safeguard  His Pride his GloryWhat but War just War  Gave  Greece  her Heroes Those who drew the Sword  As we do now against the Sons of Rapine  To quell proud Tyrants and to free Mankind  GALESUS  Yes TULLUS when to just Defence the Warrior  Confines his Force he is a worship'd Name  Dear to Mankind the First and Best of Mortals  Yet still if this can by soft Means be done  And fair Accommodation that is better  Why should we purchase with the Blood of Thousands  What may be gain'd by mutual just Concession  Why give up Peace the best of human Blessings  For the vain cruel Pride of useless Conquest  TULLUS  These soothing Dreams of philosophic Quiet  Are only fit for unfrequented Shades  The Sage should quit the busy bustling World  Ill suited to his gentle Meditations  And in some Desart find that Peace he loves  GALESUS  Mistaken Man Philosophy consists not  In airy Schemes or idle Speculations  The Rule and Conduct of all social Life  Is her great Province Not in lonely Cells  Obscure she lurks but holds her heavenly Light  To Senates and to Kings to guide their Councils  And teach them to reform and bless Mankind  All Policy but her's is false and rotten  All Valour not conducted by her Precepts  Is a destroying Fury sent from Hell  To plague unhappy Man and ruin Nations  TULLUS  To stop the Waste of that destroying Fury  Is the great Cause and Purpose of this War  Art thou a Friend to Peacesubdue the  Romans  Who who but they have turn'd this antient Land  Where from  Saturnian  Times harmonious Concord  Still lov'd to dwell into a Scene of Blood  Of endless Discord and perpetual Rapine  The Sword the vengeful Sword must drain away  This boiling Blood that thus disturbs the Nations  Talk not of Terms It is a vain Attempt  To bind th' Ambitious and Unjust by Treaties  These they elude a thousand specious Ways  Or if they cannot find a fair Pretext  They blush not in the Face of Heaven to break them  GALESUS  Why then affronted Heaven will combat for us  Set Justice on our Side and then my Voice  Shall be as loud for War as thine my Sword  Shall strike as deep at least my Blood shall flow  As freely TULLUS in my Country's Cause  But as I then would die to serve the  Volscians  So now I dare to serve them by opposing  Even with my single Voice th' impetuous Torrent  That hurries us away beyond the Bounds  Of temperate Wisdom and presume to tell thee  It is thy Passion not thy Prudence dictates  This haughty Language  TULLUS  Yes it is my Passion  A Passion for the Glory of my Country  That scorns your narrow Views of timid Prudence  Our injur'd Honour drew our Swords and never  Shall they be sheath'd while I command the  Volscians  Till  Rome  submits to  Antium    GALESUS  Rome  will perish  Ere she submit and she has still her Walls  The Strength of her Allies her native Valour  Which oft has sav'd her in the worst Extremes  And stronger yet than all Despair to aid her  TULLUS  All these will nought avail her if our Fears  Come not to her AssistanceBut GALESUS  Why urge you this to me Go talk to MARCIUS  The War has given him all his Pride could hope for  To see  Rome  's Senate humbled at his Feet  He now may wish to reign in Peace at  Antium  And thou perhaps art come an Envoy from him  To learn if I shall prove a quiet Subject  GALESUS  Thro' this unguarded Opening of thy Soul  I see what stings theeAh beware of Envy  If that pale Fury seize thee thou art lost  TULLUS 'tis easier far from the clear Breast  To keep out treacherous Vice than to expel it  Farewel Remember I have done my Duty  Goes out  TULLUS alone  This Man discerns my HeartWell What of that  Am I afraid its Movement should be seen  I whose clear Thoughts have never shunn'd the Light  Must I now seek to hide them O Misfortune  To have reduc'd myself to such a State  So much beneath the Greatness of my Soul  That like a Coward I must learn to practise  The wretched Arts of vile Dissimulation  By Heaven I will not do'tI will not stoop  To veil my Discontent a Moment longer  But see my Rival comes the happy MARCIUS  His haughty Mien his very Looks affront me  SCENE III  CORIOLANUS TULLUS  CORIOLANUS  TULLUS I have receiv'd Intelligence  That a strong Body of the  Latin  Troops  Is in full March to raise the Siege of  Rome  Another Day will bring them to its Aid  But go thou forth and lead the valiant Bands  By thee commanded to repel these Succours  Go and cut off from  Rome  its last Resource  TULLUS  I lead my Troops from the great Scene of Action  From falling  Rome  which ere Tomorrow's Sun  Shall set may be our Prey Sure you forget  My Rank and StationI disdain the Service  Give it to some you may command For me  I own no Master but the  Volscian  States  Rome  is my Object I from  Antium  brought  The noblest Army ever shook her Walls  And shall I now on that decisive Day  Doom'd by the Gods to lay her Pride in Ashes  Shall I be absent from the glorious Work  It is the highest Outrage even to think it  Just Gods Dost thou presume to give thy Orders  To me to me thy Equal in Command  Nay thy Superior Was it not my Hand  My lavish Hand bestow'd thy Power upon thee  And know proud  Roman  that the Man who gave it  Can at his Will resume it  CORIOLANUS  I propos'd  This Expedition to thee as thy Friend  Not as thy General  TULLUS  We are both  Commanders here and for my Share of Pow'r  Whene'er the Council of the  Volscian  States  Who cloath'd me with it shall again demand it  I at their Feet will lay it down persuaded  The canker'd Tongue of Envy's Self must own  That by my Service I have well deserv'd it  TULLUS  Was it to Them or Me you hither came  To crave Protection Was not then your Fortune  Your Liberty your Life at my Disposal  I rais'd you from the Dust a wretched Exile  An Outcast helpless friendless driven to beg  The lowest Refuge which Despair can seek  Shelter amidst thy Foes My pitying Goodness  Protected trusted and believ'd you grateful  O illplac'd Confidence What for all this  Is thy Return Pride Selfsufficiency  Councils apart from mine despotic Orders  The Glory of the War all pilfer'd from me  And to complete the Whole a  Latin  Army  Now conjur'd up to draw me from the Siege  Till by cajoling our tame Chiefs and dazling  The senseless Eyes of the low Mob of Soldiers  Thou shalt be solely seated in the Power  Which thank my Folly now is shar'd betwixt us  CORIOLANUS  Immortal Gods Hear I these Words from TULLUS  I will be calmI willThou dost accuse me  Of the worst Vice that can debase Mankind  Of black Ingratitude On what Foundations  What have I done to merit such a Charge  Is it my Fault if in the  Volscian  Army  My Name is as rever'd and great as thine  Can I forbid Authority and Fame  To follow Merit and SuccessYou knew  The Man whom you employ'd and should have known  He would not be a Cypher in Employment  TULLUS  Think'st thou my Heart can better brook than thine  To be that Cypher that dishonour'd Tool  Subservient to th' Ambition of another  Gods I had rather live a drudging Peasant  Unknown to Glory in some  Alpine  Village  Than at the Head of these victorious Legions  Bear the high Name of Chief without the Power  No MARCIUS no I will command indeed  And thou shalt learn with all the  Volscian  Army  To treat their General with Respect  CORIOLANUS  Respect  O TULLUS TULLUS by the Powers divine  I bore thee once Respect as high as Man  Can shew to Man From thee my Foe my Rival  I nor disdain'd nor fear'd to ask Protection  You gave me all I ask'd you gave me more  With noble Warmth of Heart which to Esteem  Added the Ties to Gratitude and Friendship  Whatever since in Council or in Arms  Has been by me atchiev'd was done for thee  My Glory all was thine The Plams I gain'd  Only compos'd a Garland for his Brow  Who rais'd this banish'd Man to tread on  Rome  TULLUS  To tread on him who rais'd himThat I know  Is thy ambitious Purpose but be certain  However  Rome  may bend beneath thy Fortune  Thou shalt not find an easy Conquest here  CORIOLANUS  May  Jove  with Lightning strike me to the Centre  If from the Day I saw thy Face at  Antium  My Heart has ever form'd one secret Thought  To hurt thy Honour or depress thy Greatness  I was thy Friend thy Soldier and thy Servant  But now I will as openly avow  Thy Jealousy has with envenom'd Breath  Made such a sudden Ravage in our Friendship  I know not what to think  TULLUS  Think me thy Foe  There is no lasting Friendship with the Proud  CORIOLANUS  Nor with the JealousBut of this enough  Come let us turn our Fire a nobler Way  We have a worthier Quarrel to pursue  It were unjust dishonourable base  Our Pride should hurt the  Volscian  Cause  TULLUS  No MARCIUS  I mean to guard it better for the future  The  Volscian  Cause is safest with a  Volscian  I therefore claim insist upon my Right  That you shall yield me my Command in Turn  The first Attack was yours 'Tis scanty Justice  The second should be mine  CORIOLANUS  TULLUS 'tis yours  O it imports not which of us command  Give me the lowest Rank among your Troops  All  Italy  will know the Voice of Fame  Will tell all future Times that I was present  That CORIOLANUS in the  Volscian  Army  Assisted when Imperial  Rome  was sack'd  That City which while he maintain'd her Cause  Invincible herself made  Antium  tremble  TULLUS  What arrogant Presumption  SCENE IV  To them VOLUSIUS entering hastily  TULLUS  Ha VOLUSIUS  Thy Looks declare some Message of Importance  VOLUSIUS  TULLUS they doI was to find thee MARCIUS  To thee a second Deputation comes  Thy Mother and thy Wife with a long Train  Of all the noblest Ladies  Rome  can boast  In mourning Habits clad approach our Camp  Preceded by a Herald to demand  Another Audience of Thee  CORIOLANUS  How VOLUSIUS  Said you the  Roman  Ladies Low indeed  Must be the State of  Rome  when thus her Matrons  She sends amidst the Tumults of a Camp  To beg Protection for the Men who lie  Trembling behind their RampartsCome once more  And see me put an End to Prayers and Treaty  SCENE V  TULLUS VOLUSIUS  VOLUSIUS  TULLUS 'tis well This answers to my Wishes  TULLUS  How What is well That humbled  Rome  once more  Shall deck him with the Trophies of our Arms  VOLUSIUS  And hop'st thou nothing from this blest Event  They who have often blasted mighty Heroes  Who oft have stoln into the firmest Hearts  And melted them to Folly They my Friend  Will do what Wisdom never could effect  TULLUS  Think'st thou the Prayers and Tears of wailing Women  Can shake the Man who with such cold Disdain  Stood firm against those venerable Consuls  And spurn'd the Genius of his kneeling Country  VOLUSIUS  It was his Pride alone that made him ours  That Passion kept him firm the flattering Charm  Of humbling those who in their Persons bore  The whole collected Majesty of  Rome  These Women are no proper Objects for it  He cannot triumph o'er his Wife and Mother  On this my Hopes are founded that these Women  May by their gentler Influence subdue him  TULLUS  Whate'er th' Event he shall no longer here  As wave his Passions dictate Peace or War  Whether his stubborn Soul maintains its Firmness  Or yields to Female Prayers the  Volscian  Honour  Will be alike betray'd If  Rome  prevails  He stops our conquering Arms from her Destruction  If he rejects her Suit he reigns our Tyrant  But by th' Immortal Gods his shortliv'd Empire  Shall never see you radiant Sun descend  VOLUSIUS  Blest be those Gods that have at last inspir'd thee  With Resolution equal to thy Cause  The Cause of Liberty  TULLUS  Be sure VOLUSIUS  If that should happen which thy Hopes portend  Should he by Nature tam'd disarm'd by Love  Respite the  Roman  DoomHe seals his own  By Heaven he dies  VOLUSIUS  Let me embrace thee TULLUS  Now breaking from the Cloud which like the Sun  Thy own too bounteous Beams had drawn around thee  TULLUS  You was deceiv'd my Friend When I with Tameness  With Tameness which astonish'd thy brave Spirit  Seem'd to submit to that unequal Sway  He arrogated o'er me know my Heart  Ne'er swell'd so high as in that cruel Moment  My Indignation like th' imprison'd Fire  Pent in the troubled Breast of glowing  Aetna  Burnt deep and silent But collected now  It shall beneath its Fury bury MARCIUS  'Tis fixt Our Tyrant dies  VOLUSIUS  TULLUS my Sword  Here claims to be employ'dNor mine alone  There are some worthy  Volsci  still remaining  Who think with us and pine beneath the Laurels  A  Roman  Chief bestows  TULLUS  Go find them strait  And bring them to the Space before his Tent  'Tis there he will receive this Deputation  Then if he sinks beneath these Womens Prayers  Or if he does notBut VOLUSIUS wait  I give thee strictest Charge to wait my Signal  Perhaps I may find Means to free the  Volsci  Without his Blood If notWe will be free  The End of the Fourth  ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  Trumpets sounding  The Scene discovers the Camp a Croud of  Volscian  Officers with Files of Soldiers drawn up as before Enter  CORIOLANUS TULLUS GALESUS VOLUSIUS  The  Roman  Ladies advance slowly from the Depth of the Stage with  VETURIA  the Mother of  CORIOLANUS  and  VOLUMNIA  his Wife at their Head all clad in Habits of Mourning  CORIOLANUS  stands at the Head of the  Volsci  surrounded by his Lictors but when he perceives his Mother and Wife after some Struggle he advances and goes hastily to embrace them  CORIOLANUS advancing  LOWER your Fasces Lictors  Oh VETURIA  Thou best of Parents  VETURIA  CORIOLANUS stop  Whom am I to embrace A Son or Foe  Say in what Light am I regarded here  Thy Mother or thy Captive  CORIOLANUS  Justly Madam  You check my Fondness that by Nature hurry'd  Forgot I was the General of the  Volsci  And you a Deputy from hostile  Rome  He goes back to his former Station  I hear you with Respect Speak your Commission  VETURIA  Think not I come a Deputy from  Rome  Rome  once rejected scorns a Second Suit  You have already heard whate'er the Tongue  Of Eloquence can plead whate'er the Wisdom  Of sacred Age the Dignity of Senates  And Virtue can enforce Behold me here  Sent by the Shades of your immortal Fathers  Sent by the Genius of the  Marcian  Line  Commission'd by my own maternal Heart  To try the soft yet stronger Powers of Nature  Thus authoriz'd I ask nay claim a Peace  On equal fair and honourable Terms  To Thee to  Rome  and to the  Volscian  People  Grant it my Son Thy Mother begs it of thee  Thy Wife the best the kindest of her Sex  And these illustrious Matrons who have sooth'd  The gloomy Hours thou hast been absent from us  We by whate'er is great and good in Nature  By every Duty by the Gods conjure Thee  To grant us Peace and turn on other Foes  Thy Arms where thou may'st purchase virtuous Glory  COIRIOLANUS  I should VETURIA break those holy Bonds  That hold the wide Republic of Mankind  Society together I should grow  A Wretch unworthy to be call'd thy Son  I should with my VOLUMNIA's fair Esteem  Forfeit her Love these Matrons would despise me  Could I betray the  Volscian  Cause thus trusted  Thus recommended to meNo my Mother  You cannot sure you cannot ask it of me  VETURIA  And does my Son so little know me me  Who took such Care to form his tender Years  Left to my Conduct by his dying Father  Have I so ill deserv'd that Trust Alas  Am I so low in thy Esteem that thou  Should'st e'er imagine I could urge a Part  Which in the least might stain the  Marcian  Honour  No let me perish rather perish All  Life has no Charms compar'd to spotless Glory  I only ask thou would'st forbid thy Troops  To waste our Lands and to assault yon City  Till Time be given for mild and righteous Measures  Grant us but One Year's Truce Mean while thou may'st  With Honour and Advantage to both Nations  Betwixt us mediate a perpetual Peace  CORIOLANUS  Alas my Mother That were granting all  VETURIA  Canst thou refuse me such a just Petition  The First Request thy Mother ever made Thee  Canst thou to her Intreaties Prayers and Tears  Prefer a savage obstinate Revenge  Have Love and Nature lost all Power within thee  CORIOLANUS  Noin my Heart they reign as strong as ever  Come I conjure you quit ungrateful  Rome  Come and complete my Happiness at  Antium  You and my dear VOLUMNIAThere VETURIA  There shall you see with what Respect the  Volsci  Will treat the Wife and Mother of their General  VETURIA  Treat me thyself with more Respect my Son  Nor dare to shock my Ears with such Proposals  Shall I desert my Country I who come  To plead her Cause Ah noA Grave in  Rome  Would better please me than a Throne at  Antium  How hast thou thus forsaken all my Precepts  How hast thou thus forgot thy Love to  Rome  O CORIOLANUS when with hostile Arms  With Fire and Sword you enter'd on our Borders  Did not the fostering Air that breathes around us  Allay thy guilty Fury and instil  A certain native Sweetness thro' thy Soul  Did not your Heart thus murmur to itself  "These Walls contain whatever can command  "Respect from Virtue or is dear to Nature  "The Monuments of Piety and Valour  "The sculptur'd Forms the Trophies of my Fathers  "My houshold Gods my Mother Wife and Children"  CORIOLANUS  Ah you seduce me with too tender Views  These Walls contain the most corrupt of Men  A base seditious Herd who trample Order  Distinction Justice Laws beneath their Feet  Insolent Foes to Worth the Foes of Virtue  VETURIA  Thou hast not thence a Right to lift thy Hand  Against the whole Community which forms  Thy eversacred CountryThat consists  Not of coeval Citizens alone  It knows no Bounds it has a Retrospect  To Ages past it looks on those to come  And grasps of all the general Worth and Virtue  Suppose my Son that I to thee had been  A harsh obdurate Parent even unjust  How would the monstrous Thought with Horror strike thee  Of plunging from Revenge thy raging Steel  Into her Breast who nurs'd thy infant Years  CORIOLANUS  Rome  is no more that  Rome  which nurs'd my Youth  That  Rome  conducted by  Patrician  Virtue  She is no more My Sword shall now chastise  These Sons of Pride and Dirt Her upstart Tyrants  Who have debas'd the noblest State on Earth  Into a sordid Democratic Faction  Why will my Mother join her Cause to theirs  VETURIA  Forbid it  Jove  that I should e'er distinguish  My Interest from the general Cause of  Rome  Or live to see a foreign hostile Arm  Reform th'Abuses of our Land of Freedom Pausing  But 'tis in vain I find to reason more  Is there no way to reach thy filial Heart  Once fam'd as much for Piety as Courage  Oft hast thou justly triumph'd CORIOLANUS  Now yield one Triumph to thy widow'd Mother  And send me back amidst the loud Acclaims  The grateful Transports of deliver'd  Rome  The happiest far the most renown'd of Women  CORIOLANUS  Why why VETURIA wilt thou plead in vain  TULLUS  Aside to  VOLUSIUS  See see VOLUSIUS how the strong Emotions  Of powerful Nature shake his inmost Soul  See how they tear himIf he long resists them  He is a God or something worse than Man  VETURIA  O MARCIUS MARCIUS canst thou treat me thus  Canst thou complain of  Rome  's Ingratitude  Yet be to me so cruelly ungrateful  To me who anxious rear'd thy Youth to Glory  Whose only Joy these many Years has been  To boast that CORIOLANUS was my Son  And dost thou then renounce me for thy Mother  Spurn me before these Chiefs before those Soldiers  That weep thy stubborn Cruelty Art thou  The hardest Man to me in this Assembly  Look at me Speak  Pausing during which he appears in great Agitation  Still dost thou turn away  Inexorable SilentThen behold me  Behold thy Mother at whose Feet thou oft  Hast kneel'd with Fondness kneeling now at thine  Wetting thy stern Tribunal with her Tears  CORIOLANUS  Raises her  VETURIA rise I cannot see Thee thus  It is a Sight uncomely to behold  My Mother at my Feet and that to urge  A Suit relentless Honour must refuse  VOLUMNIA  Advancing  Since CORIOLANUS thou dost still retain  In spite of all thy Mother now has pleaded  Thy dreadful Purpose Ah how much in vain  Were it for me to join my Supplications  The Voice of thy VOLUMNIA once so pleasing  How shall it hope to touch the Husband's Heart  When proof against the Tears of such a Parent  I dare not urge what to thy Mother thou  So firmly hast deny'dBut I must weep  Must weep if not thy harsh Severity  At least thy Situation O permit me  Taking his Hand  To shed my gushing Tears upon thy Hand  To press it with the cordial Lips of Love  And take my last Farewel  CORIOLANUS  Yet yet my Soul  Be firm and persevere  VOLUMNIA  Ah CORIOLANUS  Is then this Hand▪ this Hand to me devoted  The Pledge of Nuptial Love that has so long  Protected bless'd and shelter'd us with Kindness  Now lifted up against us Yet I love it  And with submissive Veneration bow  Beneath th' Affliction which it heaps upon us  But O what nobler Transports would it give thee  What Joy beyond Expression couldst thou once  Surmount the furious Storm of fierce Revenge  And yield thee to the Charms of Love and Mercy  Oh make the glorious Trial  CORIOLANUS  Mother Wife  Are all the Powers of Nature leagu'd against me  I cannotwill notLeave me my VOLUMNIA  VOLUMNIA  Well I obeyHow bitter thus to part  Upon such Terms to part perhaps for ever  But tell me ere I hence unroot my Feet  When to my lonely Home I shall return  What from their Father to our little Slaves  Unconscious of the Shame to which you doom them  What shall I say  Pausing He highly agitated  Naytell me CORIOLANUS  CORIOLANUS  Tell thee What shall I tell thee See these Tears  These Tears will tell thee what exceeds the Power  Of Words to speak whate'er the Son the Husband  And Father in one complicated Pang  Can feelBut leave meeven in Pity leave me  Cease cease to torture me my dear  VOLUMNIA  You only tear my Heart but cannot shake it  For by th' immortal Gods the dread Avengers  Of broken Faith  VOLUMNIA  Kneeling  Oh swear not CORIOLANUS  Oh vow not our Destruction  VETURIA  Daughter rise  Let us no more before the  Volsian  People  Expose ourselves a Spectacle of Shame  It is in vain we try to melt a Breast  That to the best Affections Nature gives us  Prefers the worstHear me proud Man I have  A Heart as stout as thine I came not hither  To be sent back rejected baffled sham'd  Hateful to  Rome  because I am Thy Mother  A  Roman  Matron knows in such Extremes  What Part to takeAnd thus I came provided  Drawing from under her Robe a Dagger  Go barbarous Son go double Parricide  Rush o'er my Corse to thy belov'd Revenge  Tread on the bleeding Breast of her to whom  Thou ow'st thy LifeLo thy first Victim  CORIOLANUS  Seizing her Hand  Ha  What dost thou mean  VETURIA  To die while  Rome  is free  To seize the Moment ere thou art her Tyrant  CORIOLANUS  O use thy Power more justly Set not thus  My treacherous Heart in Arms against my Reason  Here here thy Dagger will be well employ'd  Strike here and reconcile my fighting Duties  VETURIA  OffSet me freeThink'st thou that Grasp which binds  My feeble Hand can fetter too my Will  No my proud Son Thou canst not make me live  If  Rome  must fallNo Pow'r on Earth can do it  CORIOLANUS  Pity me generous VOLSCIYou are Men  Must it then beConfusionDo I yield  What is it Is it Weakness Is it Virtue  Well  VETURIA  What Speak  CORIOLANUS  O nomy stifled Words refuse  A Passage to the Throes that wring my Heart  VETURIA  Nay if thou yieldest yield like CORIOLANUS  And what thou do'st do nobly  CORIOLANUS  Quitting her Hand  There'Tis done  Thine is the Triumph Nature  To  VETURIA  in a low Tone of Voice  Ah VETURIA  Rome  by thy Aid is sav'dbut thy Son lost  VETURIA  He never can be lost who saves his Country  CORIOLANUS  Turning to the  Roman  Ladies  Ye Matrons Guardians of the  Roman  Safety  You to the Senate may report this Answer  We grant the Truce you ask But on these Terms  That  Rome  meantime shall to a Peace agree  Fair equal just and such as may secure  The Safety Rights and Honour of the VOLSCI  To the Troops  VOLSCI We raise the Siege Go and prepare  By the first Dawn for your Return to  Antium  As the Troops retire and  CORIOLANUS  turns to the  Roman  Ladies  TULLUS  To  VOLUSIUS  aside  'Tis as we wish'd VOLUSIUSTo your Station  But mark me wellTill thou shalt hear my Call  I charge thee not to stir One Offer more  My Honour bids me make to this proud Man  Before we strike the BlowIf he rejects it  His Blood be on his Head  VOLUSIUS  Well I obey you  He goes out  CORIOLANUS  Be it thy Care  Galesus  that a Safeguard  Attend these noble Matrons back to  Rome  SCENE II  CORIOLANUS TULLUS  CORIOLANUS  I plainly TULLUS by your Looks discern  You disapprove my Conduct  TULLUS  CAIUS MARCIUS  I mean not to assail thee with the Clamour  Of loud Reproaches and the War of Words  But Pride apart and all that can pervert  The Light of steady Reason here to make  A candid fair Proposal  CORIOLANUS  Speak I hear thee  TULLUS  I heed not tell thee that I have perform'd  My utmost Promise Thou hast been protected  Hast had thy amplest most ambitious Wish  Thy wounded Pride is heal'd thy dear Revenge  Completely sated and to crown thy Fortune  At the same time thy Peace with  Rome  restor'd  Thou art no more a  Volscian  but a  Roman  Return return thy Duty calls upon thee  Still to protect the City thou hast sav'd  It still may be in Danger from our Arms  CORIOLANUS  Insolent Man Is this thy fair Proposal  TULLUS  Be patientHear By hospitable  Jove  I mean thee wellYes one last Bounty more  I frankly will bestow I have already  From  Rome  protected thee now from the  Volsci  From their just Vengeance I will still protect Thee  Retire I will take care thou may'st with Safety  CORIOLANUS  With SafetyHeav'ns And think'st thou  CORIOLANUS  Will stoop to thee for Safety No my Safeguard  Is in myself a Bosom void of Blame  And the Great Gods Protectors of the Just  O 'tis an Act of Cowardice and Baseness  To seize the very Time my Hands are fetter'd  By the strong Chain of former Obligations  The safe sure Moment to insult meGods  Were I now free as on that Day I was  When at  Corioli  I tam'd thy Pride  This had not been  TULLUS  Thou speak'st the Truth It had not  O for that Time again Propitious Gods  If you will bless me grant itKnow for That  For that dear Purpose I have now propos'd  Thou should'st return I pray thee  Marcius  do it  And we shall meet again on nobler Terms  CORIOLANUS  When to the  Volsci  I have clear'd my Faith  Doubt not I shall find Means to meet thee nobly  We then our generous Quarrel may decide  In the bright Front of some embattel'd Field  And not in private Brawls like fierce Barbarians  TULLUS  Thou canst not hope Acquittal from the  Volsci    CORIOLANUS  I doNay more expect their Approbation  Their Thanks I will obtain them such a Peace  As thou durst never ask a perfect Union  Of their whole Nation with imperial  Rome  In all her Privileges all her Rights  By the just Gods I will What would'st thou more  TULLUS  What would I more Proud  Roman  This I would  Fire the curst Forest where these  Roman  Wolves  Haunt and infest their nobler Neighbours round them  Extirpate from the Bosom of this Land  A false perfidious People who beneath  The Mask of Freedom are a Combination  Against the Liberty of Humankind  The genuine Seed of Outlaws and of Robbers  CORIOLANUS  The Seed of Gods'Tis not for thee vain Boaster  'Tis not for such as Thou so often spar'd  By her victorious Sword to talk of  Rome  But with Respect and awful Veneration  Whate'er her Blots whate'er her giddy Factions  There is more Virtue in one single Year  Of  Roman  Story than your  Volscian  Annals  Can boast thro' all your creeping dark Duration  TULLUS  I thank thy Rage This full displays the Traitor  CORIOLANUS  Ha Traitor  TULLUS  First to thy own Country Traitor  And Traitor now to mine  CORIOLANUS  Ye heavenly Powers  I shall break looseMy RageBut let us part  Lest my rash Hand should do a hasty Deed  My cooler Thought forbids  TULLUS  For the last time  Hear me and mark my Words the sober Dictates  Of wellweigh'd Resolution Thou and I  Are in that State for which resistless Nature  Has form'd us Foes againBegoneReturn  To head the  Roman  Troops I grant thee Quittance  Full and complete of all those Obligations  Thou hast so oft insultingly complain'd  Fetter'd thy Hands They now are free I court  The worst thy Sword can do whilst thou from me  Hast nothing to expect but sore Destruction  Quit then this hostile Camp Once more I tell thee  Thou art not here one single Hour in Safety  CORIOLANUS  Think'st thou to fright me hence  TULLUS  Thou wilt not then  Thou wilt not take the Safety which I offer  CORIOLANUS  Till I have clear'd my Honour in your Council  And prov'd before them all to thy Confusion  The Falshood of thy Charge as soon in Battle  I would before thee fly and howl for Mercy  As quit the Station they have here assign'd me  TULLUS  Volusius  Hoa  SCENE III  To them  Volusius  and Conspirators with their Swords drawn  TULLUS  Seize and secure the Traitor  CORIOLANUS  Laying his Hand upon his Sword  Who dares approach me dies  VOLUSIUS  Die thou  As  Coriolanus  draws his Sword  Volusius  and the Conspirators rush upon and stab him  Tullus  standing by without having drawn his Sword  CORIOLANUS  Endeavouring to free himself  OffVillains  Falling  Oh murdering Slaves Assassinating Cowards  Dies  SCENE IV  Upon the Noise of the Tumult enter hastily to them  Galesus  the other Deputies of the  Volscian  States Officers Friends of  Coriolanus  and  Titus  with a large Band of Soldiers  GALESUS  As he enters  Are we a Nation rul'd by Laws or Fury  How Whence this Tumult  Pausing  Gods what do I see  The noble MARCIUS slain  TULLUS  You see a Traitor  Punish'd as he deserv'd the  Roman  Yoke  That thrall'd us broken and the  Volsci  free  GALESUS  Hear me great  Jove  Hear all you injur'd Powers  Of Friendship Hospitality and Faith  By that heroic Blood which from the Ground  Reeking to you for Vengeance cries I swear  This impious Breach of your eternal Laws  This daring Outrage on the  Volscian  Honour  Shall find in me a rigorous Avenger  On the same Earth polluted by their Crime  I will not live with these unpunish'd Ruffians  TULLUS  This Deed is mine I claim it allThese Men  These valiant Men were but my Instruments  To punish him who to our Face betray'd us  We shall not fear to answer to the  Volsci  In a full Council of their States at  Antium  The glorious Charge of having stabb'd their Tyrant  GALESUS  TITUS till then secure them    Tullus  and Conspirators are led off  Galesus  standing over the Body of  Coriolanus after a short Pause proceeds  Volscian  Fathers  And ye brave Soldiers see an awful Scene  Demanding serious solemn Meditation  This Man was once the Glory of his Age  Disinterested just with every Virtue  Of civil Life adorn'd in Arms unequall'd  His only Blot was this That much provok'd  He rais'd his vengeful Arm against his Country  And lo the righteous Gods have now chastis'd him  Even by the Hands of those for whom he fought  Whatever private Views and Passions plead  No Cause can justify so black a Deed  These when the angry Tempest clouds the Soul  May darken Reason and her Course controul  But when the Prospect clears her startled Eye  Must from the treacherous Gulph with Horror fly  On whose wild Wave by stormy Passions tost  So many hapless Wretches have been lost  Then be this Truth the Star by which we steer  Above  Ourselves  our  COUNTRY  should be dear  The END  EPILOGUE  SPOKEN BY Mrs WOFFINGTON  WELL Gentlemen and are you
