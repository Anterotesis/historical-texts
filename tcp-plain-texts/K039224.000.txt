MDCCXLVII  PROLOGUE  Spoke by Mr  WRIGHT  IN short good Folk a dismal Truth to tell  I come to toll our Author's passing Bell  His Farce won't do the Reason wou'd you know it  For sure the Spark has something of the Poet  The Muse cries out such sad Examples taught her  No Bard can thrive unless he cross the Water  Severe Decree no homeborn Muse delights  Nothing shall please but what a Stranger writes  Let us exert ourselves assume a Spirit  And think our Title good as theirs to Merit  What Heaven lov'd Clime but our thrice happy Coast  Of such successful Patriots can boast  With one collected Force the Arts to nourish  Make Trade survive and sacred Culture flourish  And yet to future Times 'twill seem surprizing  While each deserving Artist's sure of rising  While a Mechanick Merit's well rewarded  The tatter'd Muse repines not once regarded  To this August Assembly we submit  To you we recommend the Cause of Wit  Arise nor see a native Genius braved  Too long have such been  banish'd  or enslaved  And tho' our Author makes a weak Endeavour  He'll Mend upon the Sunshine of your Favour  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Sir William Willmore  Mr  Mynitt  Young Willmore  Mr  Wright  Jerry  Mr  Mason  WOMEN  Charlotte Lovely  Mrs  Mynitt  Kitty a kept Mistress  Mrs  Farrel  LOVE IN A MIST  SCENE  the Street  Enter  WILLMORE  and  JERRY  JERRY  O  N my Soul Sir I can't but Ad∣mire this extreme Vivacity of your Inclinations Scarce six Days since you were dying for a Babyfac'd Thing at  Oxford  and scarce six Hours in  London  till you are overhead and Ears in Love with a  Will  S'Death  Jerry  I'm all on Fire well the dear Minute of Appointment is just at hand this Letter in Answer to the One you deliver'd her informs me that she's kept by an old Jealous Knight in the City she's a fine Woman by Heaven and if it be in the Power of her Sex to drive that intollerable Coquet  Charlott  out of my Head I think 'tis she can do it  Jer  Heaven send there comes a good End on't well if I shou'd have my Bones shat∣ter'd in this Rencounter 'twill not be the first Time I have been paid for my Inge∣nuity  Will  Peace Scoundrel and learn to bear Misfortunes with a Pimplike Patience  Jer  Patience yes you may talk of Pa∣tience truly while all the Pleasure of the Sin belongs to yourself and all the Punishment to your humble Servant how oft have these unfortunate Bones of mine been beaten to a Jelly in your Service  Will  Why Sirrah if your IllStars con∣demn you to Disappointments can I prevent them If ever you suffer'd in your Vocation some unfortunate Blunder of your own oc∣casion'd it you remember the Letter you gave to  Charlott  's Jealous Guardian When  in the overflowing of your Wisdom you mistook him for her Footman  Jer  Remember it I do by all that's un∣fortunate confound the old Dog he laid on me like an  Hercules  He had put on her Footman's Livery on purpose to lay wait for me yet all this I cou'd have borne with the Patience of an Alderman but the insup∣portable Weight of your Honour's Oaken Cudgel  Will  My Resentment was reasonable Sir∣rah such a preposterous Mistake but tell me  Jerry  don't you think  Charlott  will be confoundedly piqu'd at my so sudden De∣parture fron  Oxford  without sending her one single Line or whining out the least tender Adieu at Parting  Jer  Piqu'd Sir Lord Sir I thought you understood the inside of a Coquet better tho' it might puzzle one of a longer standing at  Oxford  to tell what to make of her why Sir a Coquet is always so well pleas'd with herself that nothing in Nature is capable of discomposing her  Will  And yet  Jerry  tho' she used me with such a studied ill Nature I sometimes thought she did not hate me  Jer  Hate you no no Sir in my humble  Opinion she was extremely well pleas'd with you at least she has Reason to be very well pleas'd with herself since she had it in her Power to make so fine a Gentleman a down∣right  Will  Come out with it Sirrah I shan't be angry  Jer  A downright Ass begging your Honour's Pardon  Will  Why really Sir you do make something Free with me but will your Worship be pleas'd to explain what you mean by honouring me with that extraordi∣nary Title  Jer  Nay Sir I beg you won't take it ill that I said so for on my Honour Sir I assure you I have seen Persons of great Rank and Distinction act over all the pretty Follies of that sagacious Animal and value them∣selves extremely upon it  Will  Pray then most Philosophical Sir will you please to inform me what one Action of mine happens to fall under the Lash of your Satire  Jer  Why really Sir as you have been so long notorious in the Class of Lovers I think your Question is easily resolv'd Lovers since the Creation have been generally esteem'd  little better thanbut since the Title of the foremention'd Animal seems to affect you so nearly I'll forbear repeating it and leave it to yourself to consider what are the Mo∣tives which hurried you so suddenly to  Lon∣don  with scarce a single Guinea in your Pocket unknown to your Father or Friends and I may even venture to say almost un∣known to yourself  Will  Why  Jerry  I think my coming to  London  a Masterpiece of Resolution and I applaud myself for it extremely I doated even to Folly on that  Charlott  the greatest Tyrant of her Sex You are sensible how she used me in short I was become ridicu∣lous even to myself and judging with a great deal of Justice that in dear  London  alone I might hope to recover my Reason I resolv'd to break my Chains at once and let the Coquet see that Beauty without Merit had lost all Power to make a Fool of me  Jer  So we take Horse in a Pet Whip Spur and away leave being silly at  Oxford  to come and play the downright Fool at  London  for Curse me Sir still begging your Honour's Pardon if I can at present see that your Intentions are conducted with the least Appearance of common Sense  Will  Since I must explain my Intentions Sir to make a Man of your vast Judgment approve them you must know that by a Va∣riety of Pleasures here in  London  I design to lose even the Remembrance of my  Oxford  Mistress and least the Presence of an old peevish Father might Interrupt those Pleasures I am positively resolv'd to avoid all Places where 'twere probable I might meet with him  Jer  And so Sir you begin this fine Va∣riety of Pleasures by an Intrigue with Mistress what's her Name here this fine kept Mistress and that too with a Pair of Pockets Damnably badly lin'd a likely Prospect of succeeding truly  Will  If you exert yourself  Jerry  our Plot upon my Father can't miscarry then if she be a mercenary Whore Damn Money 'twas made to purchase Pleasure'tis now just Six  Locks at his Watch  Jer  And pray Sir what is to be your humble Servant's Duty while you amuse your∣self with the Lady You'll please to give Or∣ders that the WaitingMaid may entertain me I hope  Will  You have Business enough upon you Hands Sirrah now you see me lodg'd find out my Father and if Fortune smiles  on you you'll find me here ready to receive her Favours  Going out  Charlott  enters in Boys Cloaths and jostles him  Char  Zouns Sir en't the Street wide e∣nough or did you design to affront me  Will  I have other Business in hand Sir than either to affront you or stay to make an Apology  Char  Business what Business can he have into that House too Oh here's his Hang∣dog of a Man his Pimp and Prime Minister 'tis certainly some Intrigue has brought him there If I don't mistake that downlook that Fellow is a Pimp and a Coward so may I either Bully or Bribe him out of his Master's Secrets Harkee me you Sir Prythee what Business have you lurking about this House here  Jer  Lurking about Sir I'd have you to know I'm a Man of Honour Sir and not used to answer such Questions Lurking about Tum tum tum I walk here Sir for the Recreation of my Legs and the Pro∣creation of my Appetite  Char  I mistake Friend or your walking here tends to the Procreation of something  else come Sir no equivocating answer me directly upon what Design are you sta∣tioned at this Corner and what Business your commanding Officer has in yonder Citadel  Jer  Who the Devil have we here some young Don  Quixote  enamour'd with the fair and virtuous Lady of the Castle I'll warrant you  Char  Zouns Sir no trifling confess or by this Sword I'll pin you to the Wall come there's a Lady in the Case  Jer  Why truly Sir as you say there is a Lady in the Case a Woman of great Ho∣nour and Reputation I assure you and my Master whom you saw just now enter is a very honourable Man and by this Time I suppose them engag'd in a very honourable Affair Now Sir I have satisfy'd your Cu∣riosity you'll please to withdraw and leave me to my Meditations  Char  So you are to defend the out Works while the General beats up the Quarters within  Jer  A Man of shrew'd Penetration truly  Char  A few Words more with you good Mr Pimp and we shall come to a Conclu∣sion In short who is this Lady her Name her Fortune is she Young Handsome a Maid or marry'd is she  Jer  Hold hold Sir not so fast I've a devilish short Memory and shall never be able to answer so many Questions in Order it must be the Devil himself or a Lawyer for he wou'd fain puzzle me with cross Questions  Char  Dammee Scoundrel speak at once to the Purpose orhere's the most perswasive little Blade in Christendom  Jer  'Tis strange now Sir what a won∣derful Antipathy I've ever had even to the Sight of Cold Iron 'tis a treacherous Sort of a Crocodile Companion that's the Truth on't while it smiles in a Man's Face whip it has him through the Lungs in a twinkling  Bantering  Char  S'Deathdo you Play on me Rascal  Jer  Play on you ah Lord Sir you mistake me intirely Play on you no no Sir but 'tis my way Sir to moralize a little on every Subject that offers You must know Sir I have had Part of my Education at  Oxford  that Seat of the Muses That Theatre of Learning That Fountain of Eru∣dition now Sir in my Opinion as I have an undoubted Right to make Use of the great Share of Knowledge and Wisdom I therein acquir'd I shou'd think it quite opposite to  Prudence and common Sense to trifle any longer with so worthy a little Gentleman so by your Leave Sir  Comes nearer and nearer till he wrests the Sword from her  Char  The Devil the Villain has almost broke my Arm  Jer  And now Sir will you please to let me know what Business you have lurking about this House here  Char  Come come  Jeremy  you'll find I know you and your Master too be assur'd my Care for his Safety is my chief Motive for enquiring after him perhaps there may be Danger in his venturing into yonder House Come  Jerry  depend upon my Honour I'll not betray you let this persuade you of my Sincerity There's a Wench in Chace Ha what says my little Mercury  Gives him Money  Jer  Arguments drawn from the Mint are certainly the most prevailing in Logick an excellent Sentence by all that's EloquentSir you have rivetted  Jeremy Ply  Gentleman eter∣nally to your Service and tho' I have not the Honour of knowing you I'm so well convinc'd of your Friendship for me and my Master  that without more Preamble I plead Guilty  Char  Is she a Woman of Fortune or Fa∣mily a Widow perhaps or  Jer  No no Sir neither Maid Wife nor Widow I'll assure you but a true Daughter of the Game A kept Mistress Sir and as free of her Favours as any young Rake of ye all cou'd wish for  Char  So much the better  Jerry  for I can't possibly resist the Temptation of paying my Respects to her  Jer  Oh Lord Sir by no means Sir my Master will certainly murder me Con∣sider Sir he fix'd me here on purpose to hinder every thing in Breeches from disturb∣ing him besides Sir your Honour your Honour is pledg'd  Char  And my Pocket alone can release it  Throws him Money and Exit  Jer  Well little  London  I'll say that for thee there's no Place under the Sun where Pimps have a better Prospect of thriving  Enter Sir  WILLIAM WILLMORE  Sir Wil  An expensive Affair by the Lord  Harry  but 'tis the Misfortune of old Age the Purse must still make Amends for the Inability of the Person how the Gypsie  will leer at these little Pictures and how fond and how wanton she'll be till she nibbles them out of the old Fool's Clutches  Jer  The old Knight by all that's omi∣nous Damnation what Devil led him to this End of the Town  Aside  Sir Wil  Hah is not that  Bob's Jerry  sure the young Dog is not come up to  London  without acquainting me  Jer  Yes the Kite has discover'd me if my Master should come Bolt out of his Bo∣rough what a sweet piece of Work have we made on't well I must on now in my own Defence  As if not seeing him  alas a Day my poor old Master 'tis for him my very Heart and Bowels ake the melancholly News will certainly be the Death of the poor old Gentleman  Sir Wil  What does he Mutter what melancholly News is the Blockhead dreaming about  Jer  His very Soul was in that Son of his and an hopeful dutiful Youth he was as one might meet in a Summer Day's riding  Sir Wil  Ad so  Jerry  why  Jerry  are you distracted or drunk or what Devil's the matter with you  Jer  Ads heart my old Master the very  Gentleman I'd look forah Sir the most pitiful News poor Mr  Robert  Sir Wil  What is he Dead  Jer  No Sir not absolutely Dead neither but  Sir Wil  But but what Blockhead he has play'd the Fool I suppose and marry'd his Bedmaker or his Millener  Jer  Would to Heaven it was no worse Sir tho' Matrimony be a Noose and a De∣vil of a one poor Mr  Robert  is in a fair Way of being tied up in a quite different Manner I assure you  Sir Wil  What do you say Sirrah my Son  Bob  in a fair Way to be hang'd  Jer  In short Sir he has kill'd his Man fairly kill'd him a Dispute happened a Challenge was sent the Gentlemen met and it was my young Master's very good Fortune Sir to pink the very Soul of his Antagonist for to besure Sir Mr  Robert  as he has the Honour of being your Son must be a Man of Courage  Sir Wil  Courage what the Devil had he to do with Courage A fine talk about Cou∣rage truly so good  Robert Willmore  Esq  Son of Sir  William Willmore  of  Willmore Hall  in  Comitatu Bucks  must be hang'd forsooth  because he is a Man of Courage  Jer  His Duty Sir and this Letter  Sir Wil  Hum Hum  According to the Principles of Honour Sir I could not avoid calling an Insolent young Officer to a close Ac∣count for publickly affronting me It was his Misfortune to fall by my Sword  fine Princi∣ples of Honour truly  I am now under an Arrest yet if any Thing hinders the Affair being immediately made up 'tis a Deficiency of ready Money  so  which I'm positive you'll pre∣vent with your accustomed Indulgence  A mighty pretty Request a very reasonable Demand truly Hearkee my good Mr Squire you'll let your Man of Courage know from me that I don't at all approve of his Principles of Honour and that I'm resolv'd not to part with a single Farthing and if he has no other Way to Escape but by the help of my broad Pieces he may e'en say his Prayers and prepare for another World for I'll not part with a Souse tell him so and so farewell good Mr Man of Courage  Jer  For Heaven's Sake Sir consider the poor young Gentleman will break his Heart if you treat him with so much Inhumanity  Sir Wil  Break his Heart Sir Ouns let him better he shou'd break his Heart than  be hang'd Courage quotha so if he thinks fit to Kill half the Town in his Courage I have Nothing to do but open my Bags and scatter my old Gold to save him from the Gallows a good Jest a very good Jest by the Lord  Harry  Jer  Besides Sir as his Annuity becomes due you may repay yourself what you are pleased to advance upon this Occasion you were always indulgent Sir consider he is young  Sir Wil  He's young and I'm old Sir he's a Fool and I'm a wise Man Sir he's a Man of Courage and I'm a Man that must pay for it it seems here Scoundrel here are two Ten Pound Bags ready seal'd and yet I've a wonderful Temptation to let the young Rascal Hang for it here are twenty Pieces Sirrah and let me hear that he makes a proper Use of them and not one Word more of his Courageor  Jer  Oh Lord Sir not a Tittle we shall take a quite different Method Sir when those are expired And so Sir with all Sub∣mission and Respect I return to my Master who'll be overjoy'd at the agreeable News of your good Health and the Success of his Cou∣rage and my Parts  Exit Jerry  Sir Wil  S'Death a young Dog I wonder what Devil possesses these young Fellows Nothing but cutting of Throats Bloodshed and Battery upon every fiddle faddle
