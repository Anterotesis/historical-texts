 AN ESSAY ON THE WRITINGS AND GENIUS OF POPE  SATYRA QUIDEM TOTA NOSTRA EST IN QUA PRIMUS INSIGNEM LAUDEM ADEPTUS EST LUCILIUS QUI QUOSDAM ITA DEDITOS SIBI ADHUC HABET AMATORES UT EUM NON EJUSDEM MODO OPERIS AUTORIBUS SED OMNIBUS POETIS PRAEFERRE NON DUBITENT  QUINTILIAN  LONDON  PRINTED FOR M COOPER AT THE GLOBE IN PATERNOSTER ROW MDCCLVI  TO THE REVEREND D  R  YOUNG RECTOR of WELWYN In HERTFORDSHIRE  DEAR SIR  PERMIT me to break into your retirement the residence of virtue and literature and to trouble you with a few reflections on the merits and real character of an admired author and on other collateral subjects that will naturally arise No love of singularity no affectation of paradoxical opinions gave rise to the following work I revere the memory of POPE I respect and honour his abilities but I do not think him at the head of his profession In other words in that species of poetry wherein POPE excelled he is superior  to all mankind and I only say that this species of poetry is not the most excellent one of the art We do not it should seem sufficiently attend to the difference there is betwixt a MAN OF WIT a MAN OF SENSE and a TRUE POET Donne and Swift were undoubtedly men of wit and men of sense but what traces have they left of PURE POETRY Fontenelle and La Motte are entitled to the former character but what can they urge to gain the latter Which of these characters is the most valuable and useful is entirely out of the question all I plead for is to have their several provinces kept distinct from each other and to impress on the reader that a clear head and acute understanding are not sufficient alone to  make a POET that the most solid observations on human life expressed with the utmost elegance and brevity are MORALITY and not POETRY that the EPISTLES of Boileau in RHYME are no more poetical than the CHARACTERS of Bruyere in PROSE and that it is a creative and glowing IMAGINATION  "acer spiritus ac vis"  and that alone that can stamp a writer with this exalted and very uncommon character which so few possess and of which so few can properly judge  FOR one person who can adequately relish and enjoy a work of imagination twenty are to be found who can taste and judge of observations on familiar life and the manners of the age The  satires of Ariosto are more read than the Orlando Furioso or even Dante Are there so many cordial admirers of Spenser and Milton as of HudibrasIf we strike out of the number of these supposed admirers those who appear such out of fashion and not of feeling Swift's rhapsody on poetry is far more popular than Akenside's noble ode to Lord Huntingdon The EPISTLES on the Characters of men and women and your sprightly satires my good friend are more frequently perused and quoted than L'Allegro and Il Penseroso of Milton Had you written only these satires you would indeed have gained the title of a man of wit and a man of sense but I am confident would not insist on being denominated a POET MERELY on their account  NON SATIS EST PURIS VERSUM PERSCRIBERE VERBIS  IT is amazing this matter should ever have been mistaken when Horace has taken particular and repeated pains to settle and adjust the opinion in question He has more than once disclaimed all right and title to the name of POET on the score of his ethic and satiric pieces  NEQUE ENIM CONCLUDERE VERSUM  DIXERIS ESSE SATIS  are lines often repeated but whose meaning is not extended and weighed as it ought to be Nothing can be more judicious than the method he prescribes of trying whether any composition be essentially poetical or not which is to drop entirely the measures and numbers and transpose and invert the order of the  words and in this unadorned manner to peruse the passage If there be really in it a true poetical spirit all your inversions and transpositions will not disguise and extinguish it but it will retain its lustre like a diamond unset and thrown back into the rubbish of the mine Let us make a little experiment on the following wellknown lines  "  Yes you despise the man that is confined to books who rails at human kind from his study tho' what he learns he speaks and may perhaps advance some general maxims or may be right by chance The coxcomb bird so grave and so talkative that cries whore knave and cuckold from his cage tho' he rightly call many a passenger you hold him no philosopher And yet such is the fate  of all extremes men may be read too much as well as books We grow more partial for the sake of the observer to observations which we ourselves make less so to written wisdom because another's Maxims are drawn from notions and those from guess  "  What shall we say of this passageWhy that it is most excellent sense but just as poetical as the  "Qui fit Maecenas"  of the author who recommends this method of trial Take any ten lines of the Iliad Paradise Lost or even of the Georgics of Virgil and see whether by any process of critical chymistry you can lower and reduce them to the tameness of prose You will find that they will appear like Ulysses in his disguise  of rags still a hero tho' lodged in the cottage of the herdsman Eumaeus  THE Sublime and the Pathetic are the two chief nerves of all genuine poesy What is there very sublime or very Pathetic in POPE In his works there is indeed  "nihil inane nihil arcessitumpuro tamen fonti quam magno flumini propior"  as the excellent Quintilian remarks of Lysias And because I am perhaps ashamed or afraid to speak out in plain English I will adopt the following passage of Voltaire which in my opinion as exactly characterizes POPE as it does his model Boileau for whom it was originally designed  "INCAPABLE PEUTETRE DU SUBLIME QUI ELEVE L'AME ET DU SENTIMENT QUI L'ATTENDRIT MAIS FAIT POUR ECLAIRER CEUX A QUI LA NATURE ACCORDA L'UN  ET L'AUTRE LABORIEUX SEVERE PRECIS PUR HARMONIEUX IL DEVINT ENFIN LE POETE DE LA RAISON"  OUR English poets may I think be be disposed in four different classes and degrees In the first class I would place first our only three sublime and pathetic poets SPENSER SHAKESPEARE MILTON and then at proper intervals OTWAY and LEE In the second class should be placed such as possessed the true poetical genius in a more moderate degree but had noble talents for moral and ethical poesy At the head of these are DRYDEN DONNE DENHAM COWLEY CONGREVE In the third class may be placed men of wit of elegant taste and some fancy in describing familiar life Here may be numbered PRIOR  WALLER PARNELL SWIFT FENTON In the fourth class the mere versifiers however smooth and mellifluous some of them may be thought should be ranked Such as PITT SANDYS FAIRFAX BROOME BUCKINGHAM LANSDOWN In which of these classes POPE deserves to be placed the following work is intended to determine  I am  DEAR SIR  Your affectionate And faithful servant  AN ESSAY ON THE WRITINGS and GENIUS OF POPE  SECT I Of the PASTORALS and the MESSIAH an Eclogue  PRINCES and Authors are seldom spoken of during their lives with justice and impartiality Admiration and envy their constant attendants like two unskilful artists are apt to overcharge their pieces with too great a quantity of light or of shade and are disqualified happily to hit upon that middle colour that mixture of  error and excellence which alone renders every representation of man just and natural This perhaps may be one reason among others why we have never yet seen a fair and candid criticism on the character and merits of our last great poet Mr POPE I have therefore thought that it would be no unpleasing amusement or uninstructive employment to examine at large without blind panegyric or petulant invective the writings of this English Classic in the order in which they are arranged in the elegant edition of Mr Warburton As I shall neither censure nor commend without alleging the reason on which my opinion is founded I shall be entirely unmoved at the imputation of malignity or the clamours of popular prejudice  IT is something strange that in the pastorals of a young poet there should not be found a single rural image that is new but this I am afraid is the case in the PASTORALS before us The ideas of Theocritus Virgil  and Spenser are indeed here exhibited in language equally mellifluous and pure but the descriptions and sentiments are trite and common That the design of pastoral poesy is to represent the undisturbed felicity of the golden age is an empty notion which though supported by a Rapin and a Fontenelle I think all rational critics have agreed to exstirpate and explode But I do not remember that even these lastmentioned critics have remarked the circumstance that gave origin to the opinion that any golden age was intended Theocritus the father and the model of this enchanting species of composition lived and wrote in Sicily The climate of Sicily was delicious and the face of the country various and beautiful it's vallies and it's precipices it's grottos and cascades were SWEETLY INTERCHANGED and it's fruits and flowers were lavish and luscious The poet described what he saw and felt and had no need to have recourse to those artificial assemblages of pleasing objects which are not to be found  in nature The figs and the honey which he assigns as a reward to a victorious shepherd were in themselves exquisite and are therefore assigned with great propriety  Idyll i ver  and the beauties of that luxurious landschape so richly and circumstantially delineated in the close of the seventh idyllium where all things smelt of summer and smelt of autumn  Ver  were present and real Succeeding writers supposing these beauties too great and abundant to be real referred them to the fictitious and imaginary scenes of a golden age  A MIXTURE of British and Grecian ideas may justly be deemed a blemish in the PASTORALS of POPE and propriety is certainly violated when he couples Pactolus with Thames and Windsor with Hybla Complaints of IMMODERATE heat and wishes to be conveyed to cooling caverns when uttered  by the inhabitants of Greece have a decorum and consistency which they totally lose in the character of a British shepherd and Theocritus during the ardors of Sirius must have heard the murmurings of a brook and the whispers of a pine  Idyll i ver  with more homefelt pleasure than Pope  Past iv ver  could possibly experience upon the same occasion We can never completely relish or adequately understand any author especially any Ancient except we constantly keep in our eye his climate his country and his age POPE himself informs us in a note that he judiciously omitted the following verse  And list'ning wolves grow milder as they hear  Past ii  on account of the absurdity which Spenser overlooked of introducing wolves into England But on this principle which is certainly a just one may it not be asked why he should speak the scene lying in Windsor  Forest of the SULTRY SIRIUS  Past ii ver  of the GRATEFUL CLUSTERS  of grapes  Past iii ver  of a  pipe of reeds  Past ii ver  the antique fistula of  thanking Ceres for a plentiful harvest  Ibid ver  of  the sacrifice of lambs  Past iv ver  with many other instances that might be adduced to this purpose That POPE however was sensible of the importance of adapting images to the scene of action is obvious from the following example of his judgment for in translating  Audiit EUROTAS jussitque ediscere LAUROS  he has dextrously dropt the  laurels  appropriated to Eurotas as he is speaking of the river Thames and has rendered it  THAMES heard the numbers as he flow'd along  And bade his  willows  learn the moving song  Ibid ver  IN the passages which POPE has imitated from Theocritus and from his Latin translator Virgil he has merited but little applause It may not be unentertaining to see  how coldly and unpoetically POPE has copied the subsequent appeal to the nymphs on the death of Daphnis in comparison of Milton on LYCIDAS one of his juvenile pieces  THEOCRITUS Idyll i  Where stray ye muses in what lawn or grove  While your Alexis pines in hopeless love  In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides  Or else where Cam his winding vales divides  POPE Past ii  Where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep  Clos'd o'er the head of your lov'd Lycidas  For neither were ye playing on the steep  Where your old bards the famous Druids lie  Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high  Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream  MILTON  THE mention of places remarkably romantic the supposed habitation of Druids bards and wizards is far more pleasing to the imagination than the obvious introduction of Cam and Isis as seats of the Muses  A SHEPHERD in Theocritus wishes with much tenderness and elegance both which must suffer in a literal translation  "Would I could become a murmuring bee fly into your grotto and be permitted to creep among the leaves of ivy and fern that compose the chaplet which adorns your head"    Idyll iii  POPE has thus altered this image  Oh were I made by some transforming pow'r  The captive bird that sings within thy bow'r  Then might my voice thy list'ning ears employ  And I those kisses he receives enjoy  Past ii  On three accounts the former image is preferable to the latter for the pastoral wildness the delicacy and the uncommonness of the thought I cannot forbear adding that the riddle of the  Royal Oak  in the first Pastoral invented in imitation of the Virgilian aenigmas in the third eclogue savours of pun and puerile conceit  Say Daphnis say in what glad soil appears  A wondrous tree that sacred monarchs bears  Ver  With what propriety could the tree whose shade protected the king be said to be prolific of princes  THAT POPE has not equalled Theocritus will indeed appear less surprising if we reflect that no original writer ever remained so unrivalled by succeeding copyists as this Sicilian master  IF it should be objected that the barrenness of invention imputed to POPE from a view of his PASTORALS is equally imputable to the Bucolics of Virgil it may be answered that whatever may be determined of the rest yet the first and last Eclogues of Virgil are indisputable proofs of true genius and power of fancy The influence of war on the tranquillity of rural life  I have been lately highly entertained with the accidental perusal of FIVE PASTORALS written on this plan descriptive of the calamities supposed to have been felt by the shepherds of Germany during the last war They abound in many new circumstances of pastoral distress and many tender images I cannot learn the name of the author  rendered the subject  of the first new and interesting its composition is truly dramatic and the characters of it's two shepherds are well supported and happily contrasted and the last has expressively painted the changeful resolutions the wild wishes the passionate and abrupt exclamations of a disappointed and despairing lover  UPON the whole the principal merit of the PASTORALS of POPE consists in their correct and musical versification musical to a degree of which rhyme could hardly be thought capable and in giving the first specimen of that harmony in English verse which is now become indispensably necessary and which has so forcibly and universally influenced the publick ear as to have rendered every moderate rhymer melodious POPE lengthened the abruptness of Waller and at the same time contracted the exuberance of Dryden  I REMEMBER to have been informed by an intimate friend of POPE that he had once laid a design of writing AMERICAN ECLOGUES The subject would have been fruitful of the most poetical imagery and if properly executed would have rescued the author from the accusation here urged of having written Eclogues without invention  OUR author who had received an early tincture of religion a reverence for which he preserved to the last was with justice convinced that the scriptures of God contained not only the purest precepts of morality but the most elevated and sublime strokes of genuine poesy strokes as much superior to any thing Heathenism can produce as is Jehovah to Jupiter This is the case more particularly in the exalted prophesy of Isaiah which POPE has so successfully versified in an Eclogue that incontestably surpasses the Pollio of Virgil although perhaps the dignity the energy and the simplicity of the original are  in a few passages weakened and diminished by florid epithets and useless circumlocutions  See nature hastes her earliest wreaths to bring  With all the incense of the breathing spring  MESS v  are lines which have too much prettiness and too modern an air The judicious addition of circumstances and adjuncts is what renders poesy a more lively imitation of nature than prose POPE has been happy in introducing the following circumstance the prophet says  "The parched ground shall become a pool"  Our author expresses this idea by saying that the shepherd    shall  START amid the thirsty wild to hear  New falls of water murmuring in his ear  v  A striking example of a similar beauty may be added from Thompson Melisander in the Tragedy of AGAMEMNON after telling us he was conveyed in a vessel at midnight to the wildest of the Cyclades adds when the pitiless mariners had left him in that dreadful solitude  I never heard  A sound so dismal as their parting oars  ON the other hand the prophet has been sometimes particular when POPE has been only general  "Lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to theeThe multitude of CAMELS shall cover thee the DROMEDARIES of Median and Ephah all they from Sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the Lord All the FLOCKS of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the RAMS of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee"  Isaiah c lx v  In imitating this passage POPE has omitted the different beasts that in so picturesque a manner characterize the different countries which were to be gathered together on this important event and says only in undistinguishing terms  See barbarous nations at thy gates attend  Walk in thy light and in thy temple bend  See thy bright altars throng'd with prostrate kings  And heap'd with products of Sabaean springs  Ver  AS prosperity and happiness are described in this Eclogue by a combination of the most pleasing and agreeable objects so misery and destruction are as forcibly delineated in the same Isaiah by the circumstances of distress and desolation that were to attend the fall of that magnificent city Babylon and the latter is perhaps a more proper and interesting subject for poetry than the former as such kinds of objects make the deepest impression on the mind pity being a stronger sensation than complacency Accordingly a noble ode on the destruction of Babylon taken from the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah has been written by Mr Lowth whose latin prelections on the inimitable poesy of the Hebrews abounding in remarks entirely new delivered in the purest and most expressive language are the richest augmentation literature  has lately received and from which the following passage gradually unfolding the singular beauties of this prophecy is here closely though faintly translated and inserted as a pattern of just criticism  "THE prophet having predicted the deliverance of the Jews and their return into their own country from their rigorous Babylonish captivity instantly introduces them singing a certain triumphal song on the fall of the king of Babylon a song abounding in the most splendid images and carried on by perpetual and those very beautiful personifications The song begins with a sudden exclamation of the Jews expressing their joy and wonder at the unexpected change of their condition and death of the tyrant Earth with her inhabitants triumphs the firs and cedars of Libanus under which images the allegoric style frequently shadows the kings and princes of the Gentiles rejoice and insult with reproaches the broken power of their most implacable foe  She is at rest the whole earth is quiet they break forth into singing  Even the firs rejoice at thee the cedars of Libanus  Since thou art laid low no feller is come up against us  There follows a most daring prosopopeia of ORCUS or the infernal regions he rouzes his inhabitants the manes of princes and the shades of departed kings immediately all of them arise from their thrones and walk forward to meet the king of Babylon they insult and deride him and gather consolation from his calamity  Art thou also made weak as we art thou made like unto us  Is thy pride dashed down to Orcus the noise of thy harps  The worm is strewn under thee the earthworm is thy covering  The Jews are again represented speaking they most strongly exaggerate his remarkable fall by an exclamation formed in the manner of funeral lamentations  How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer son of the morning  Thou art dashed down to the earth thou that didst crush the nations  They next represent the king himself speaking and madly boasting of his unbounded power whence the prodigiousness of his ruin is wonderfully aggravated Nor is this enough a new personage is immediately formed Those are introduced who found the body of the king of Babylon cast out they survey it it closely and attentively and at last hardly know it  Is this the man who made earth tremble who shook the kingdoms  Who made the world a solitude and destroyed it's cities  They reproach him with the loss of the common rite of sepulture which was deservedly denied to him for his cruelty and oppression and curse his name his race and posterity The scene is closed by a most awful speech of God himself menacing a perpetual extirpation to the king of Babylon to his descendants and to his city and confirming  the immutability of his councils by the ratification of a solemn oath  WHAT images how various how thicksown how sublime exalted with what energy what expressions figures and sentiments are here accumulated together we hear the Jews the cedars of Libanus the shades of the departed kings the king of Babylon those who find his body and lastly Jehovah himself all speaking in order and behold them acting their several parts as it were in a drama One continued action is carried on or rather a various and manifold series of different actions is connected Every excellence more peculiarly appropriated to the sublimer ode is consummatley displayed in this poem of Isaiah which is the most perfect and unexampled model among all the monuments of antiquity The personages are frequent but not confused are bold but not affected a free lofty and truly divine spirit predominates through the whole Nor is any thing wanting to crown and complete the sublimity  of this ode with absolute beauty nor can the Greek or Roman poesy produce any thing that is similar or second to this ode  Praelect ad calc  "  IT cannot be thought strange that he who could so judiciously explain could as poetically express the ideas of Isaiah the latter he has performed in many instances but in none more strikingly than in the following which magnificently represents the Messiah treading the winepress in his anger and which and impartial judge not blinded by the charms of antiquity will think equal to any description in Virgil in point of elegance and energy  Ille patris vires indutus et iram  Dira rubens graditur per stragem et fracta potentum  Agmina prona solo prostratisque hostibus ultor  Insultat ceu praela novo spumantia musto  Exercens salit attritas calcator in uvas  Congestamque struem subigit caede atra recenti  Crura madent rorantque inspersae sanguine vestes  Prael  SECT II Of WINDSORFOREST and LYRIC Pieces  DESCRIPTIVE Poetry was by no means the shining talent of POPE This assertion may be manifested by the few images introduced in the poem before us which are not equally applicable to any place whatsoever Rural beauty in general and not the peculiar beauties of the forest of Windsor are here described Nor are the sports of setting shooting and fishing included between the ninetythird and one hundred and fortysixth verses to which the reader is referred at all more appropriated The stagchase that immediately follows although some of the lines are incomparably good  See particularly ver  is not so full so animated and so circumstantiated as that of Somerville  THE digression that describes the demolition  of the thirty villages by William the Conqueror is well imagined particularly  Round broken columns clasping ivy twin'd  O'er heaps of ruin stalk'd the stately hind  The fox obscene to gaping tombs retires  And savage howlings fill the sacred quires  Ver  Though I cannot forbear thinking that the following picture of the ruins of GodstowNunnery drawn it should seem on the spot and worthy the hand of Paul Brill is by no means excelled by the foregoing  Qua nudo Rosamonda humilis sub culmine tecti  Marmoris obscuri servat inane decus  Rara intermissae circum vestigia molis  Et sola in vacuo tramite porta labat  Sacrae olim sedes riguae convallis in umbra  Et veteri pavidum religione nemus  Pallentes nocturna ciens campana sorores  Hinc matutinum saepe monebat avem  Hinc procul in media tardae caliginis hora  Prodidit arcanas arcta fenestra faces  Nunc muscosa extant sparsim de cespite saxa  Nunc muro avellunt germen agreste boves  Carmina Quadrages Oxon pag  VOLTAIRE that lively maintainer of many a paradox is inclined to dispute the truth of the devastation imputed to William I  "Une telle action says he est trop insensée pour etre vraisemblable Les historiens ne font pas attention qu'il faut au moins vingt années pour qu'un nouveau plan d'arbres devienne une forêt propre a là chasse On lui fait semer cette forêt en il avoit alors ans Quelle apparence y atil qu'un homme raisonable ait à cet âge détruit des villages pour semer quinze lieues en bois dans l'espérance d'y chasser un jour"  Abregé de l'Histoire Universelle c tom pag  There is indeed some probability that the character of this prince has been misrepresented and his oppressions magnified The law of the curfeubell by which every inhabitant of England was obliged to extinguish his fire and candles at eight in the evening has been usually alleged as the institution of a capricious tyrant But this law as Voltaire  Ibid  rightly observes was so far from being  absurdly tyrannical that it was an ancient ecclesiastical custom established among all the monasteries of the north Their houses were built of wood and so cautious a method to prevent fire was an object worthy a prudent legislator A more amiable idea than POPE has here exhibited of the Conqueror is given us of the same prince by that diligent enenquirer into antiquity the President Henault in a passage that contains some curious particulars characteristical of the manner of that age  "This monarch protected letters at a time when books were so rare and uncommon that a countess of Anjou gave for a collection of homilies two hundred sheep a measure of wheat another of rye a third of millet and a certain number of the skins of martens"  Novel Abregé Chronologique de l'Histoire de France tom pag To this useful and entertaining work Voltaire has been deeply indebted without confessing his obligation  But to return The story of  Ver  Lodona is prettily Ovidian but there is scarcely a single incident in it  but what is borrowed from some transformation of Ovid The picture of a virtuous and learned man in retirement  Ver  is highly finished as it flowed from the soul of our poet who was here in his proper element recommending integrity and science He has no where discovered more poetic enthusiasm than where speaking of the poets who lived or died near this spot he breaks out  I seem through consecrated walks to rove  I hear soft music die along the grove  Led by the sound I roam from shade to shade  By godlike poets venerable made  Ver  The enumeration of the princes who were either born or interred at Windsor is judiciously introduced Yet I have frequently wondered that he should have omitted the opportunity of describing at length it's venerable ancient castle and the fruitful and extensive prospects  The great improvements lately made near Windsorlodge by the Duke of Cumberland particularly the magnificent lake and cascade highly deserve to be celebrated by some future POPE and would have contributed not a little to the beauty of the poem now before us  which it commands He  slides with dexterity and address from speaking of the miseries of the civil war to the blessings of peace  Ver  OLD FATHER THAMES is raised and acts and speaks with becoming dignity And though the trite and obvious insignia of a river god are attributed yet there is one circumstance in his appearance highly picturesque  His seagreen mantle waving with the wind  Ver  The relievo of his urn also is finely imagined  The figur'd streams in waves of silver roll'd  And on their banks Augusta rose in gold  Ver  He has with exquisite skill selected only those rivers as attendants of Thames who are his subjects his tributaries or neighbours I cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the passage  First the fam'd authors of his ancient name  The winding Isis and the fruitful Tame  The Kennet swift for silver eels renown'd  The Loddon slow with verdant osiers crown'd  Cole whose dark streams his flowery islands lave  And chalky Wey that rolls a milky wave  The blue transparent Vandalis appears  The gulphy Lee his sedgy tresses rears  And sullen Mole that hides his diving flood  And silent Darent stain'd with British blood  Ver  AS I before produced a passage of Milton which I thought superior to a similar one of POPE I shall in order to preserve impartiality produce another from Milton in which I think him inferior to the last quoted passage except perhaps in the third line first remarking that both authors are much indebted to Spenser  Fairy Queen B iv C  Rivers arise whether thou be the son  Of utmost Tweed or Oose or gulphy Dun  Or Trent who like some earthborn giant spreads  His thirty arms along th' indented meads  Or sullen Mole that runneth underneath  Or Severn swift guilty of maiden's death  Or rocky Avon or of sedgy Lee  Or coaly Tine or ancient hallow'd Dee  Or Humber loud that keeps the Scythian's name  Or Medway smooth or royaltowred Thame  At a vacation exercise c Ver Milton was now aged but nineteen  THE poets both ancient and modern are obliged to the rivers for some of their most most striking descriptions The Tiber and the Nile of Virgil the Aufidus of Horace the Sabrina of Milton and the Scamander of Homer are among their capital figures  THE influences and effects of peace and its consequence a diffusive commerce are expressed by selecting such circumstances as are best adapted to strike the imagination by lively pictures the selection of which chiefly constitutes true poetry An historian or prosewriter might say  "Then shall the most distant nations crowd into my port"  a poet sets before your eyes  "the ships of uncouth form"  that shall arrive in the Thames  Ver et seq  And feather'd people croud my wealthy side  And naked youths and painted chiefs admire  Our speech our colour and our strange attire  And the benevolence and poetry of the succeeding wish are worthy admiration  Till the freed Indians in their native groves  Reap their own fruits and woo their sable loves  Peru once more a race of kings behold  And other Mexicos be roof'd with gold  Ver  The two epithets  native  and  sable  have peculiar elegance and force and as Peru was particularly famous for its long succession of Incas and Mexico for many magnificent works of massy gold there is great propriety in fixing the restoration of the grandeur of each to that object for which each was once so remarkable  THE groupe of allegorical personages that succeeds the last mentioned lines are worthy the pencil of Rubens or Julio Romano it may perhaps however be wished that the epithets  barbarous  discord  mad  ambition  hateful  envy  Ver et seq  had been particular and picturesque instead of general and indiscriminating though it may possibly be urged that in describing the dreadful inhabitants of the portal of hell Virgil has not always used  such adjuncts and epithets as a painter or statuary might work after he says only  ultrices  CURAE  mortiferum  BELLUM  mala  MENTIS GAUDIA particularly  malesuada  is only applied to FAMES instead of a word that might represent the meagre and ghastly figure intended I make no scruple of adding that in this famous passage Virgil has exhibited no images so lively and distinct as these living figures painted by POPE each of them with their proper insignia and attributes  ENVY her own snakes shall feel  Ver et seq  And PERSECUTION mourn his broken wheel  There FACTION roar REBELLION bite her chain  And gasping FURIES thirst for blood in vain  A PERSON of no small rank has informed me that Mr Addison was inexpressibly chagrined at this noble conclusion of WINDSORFOREST both as a politician and as a poet As a politician because it so highly celebrated that treaty of peace which he deemed so pernicious to the liberties of Europe and as a  poet because he was deeply conscious that his own CAMPAIGN that gazette in rhyme contained no strokes of such genuine and sublime poetry as the conclusion before us  IT is one of the greatest and most pleasing arts of descriptive poetry to introduce moral sentences and instructions in an oblique and indirect manner in places where one naturally expects only painting and amusement We have virtue as Mr POPE remarks  Iliad B in the notes Ver  put upon us by surprize and are pleased to find a thing where we should never have looked to meet with it I must do a noble English poet the justice to observe that it is this particular art that is the very distinguishing excellence of COOPERSHILL throughout which the descriptions of places and images raised by the poet are still tending to some hint or leading into some reflection upon moral life or political institution much in the same manner as the real sight of such scenes and prospects is apt to give the mind a  composed turn and incline it to thoughts and contemplations that have a relation to the object This is the great charm of the incomparable ELEGY written in a Country ChurchYard Having mentioned the rustic monuments and simple epitaphs of the swains the amiable poet falls into a very natural reflection  For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day  Nor cast one longing lingering look behind  OF this art Mr POPE has exhibited some specimens in the poem we are examining but not so many as might be expected from a mind so strongly inclined to a moral way of writing After speaking of hunting the hare he immediately subjoins much in the spirit of Denham  Beasts urg'd by us their fellow beasts pursue  And learn of man each other to undo  Ver  Where he is describing the tyrannies formerly exercised in this kingdom  Cities laid waste they storm'd the dens and caves  He instantly adds with an indignation becoming a true lover of liberty as such he was  For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves  Ver  But I am afraid our author in the following passage has fallen into a fault very uncommon in his writings into a reflection that is very farfetched and forced  Here waving groves a chequer'd scene display  And part admit and part exclude the day  As some coy nymph her lover's warm address  Nor quite indulges nor can quite repress  Ver  BOHOURS would rank this comparison among false thoughts and Italian conceits such particularly as abound in the works of Marino The fallacy consists in giving design and artifice to the wood as well as to the  coquette and in putting the light of the sun and the warmth of a lover on a level  A PATHETIC reflection properly introduced into a descriptive poem will have a still greater force and beauty and more deeply interest a reader than a moral one When POPE therefore has described a pheasant shot he breaks out into a very masterly exclamation  Ah what avail his glossy varying dyes  His purple crest and scarletcircled eyes  The vivid green his shining plumes unfold  His painted wings and breast that flames with gold  Ver  where this exquisite picture heightens the distress and powerfully excites the commiseration of the reader To this purpose I may add a passage in an ODE to Fancy  Dodsley's Miscell Pag Ver  which I have heard commended for a similar stroke of a pathetic nature After passing through various scenes the poet leads us  To some abby's mouldering towers  Where to avoid cold wintry showers  The naked beggar shivering lies  While whistling tempests round her rise  And trembles least the tottering wall  Should on her sleeping infants fall  The object of fear indicated in the two last lines is I believe new and unborrowed and interests us in the scene described Under this head it would be unpardonable to omit a capital and I think the most excellent example extant of the beauty here intended in the third Georgic of Virgil  Ver  The poet having mournfully described a heifer struck with a pestilence and falling down dead in the middle of his work artfully reminds us of his former services  Quid labor aut benefacta juvant quid vomere terras  Invertisse graves  By the epithet GRAVES Virgil insinuates after his manner the difficulty and laboriousness of the work  This circumstance would have been sufficient as it raised our pity from a motive of gratitude but with this circumstance the tender  Virgil was not content what he adds therefore of the natural undeviating temperance of the animal who cannot have contracted disease by excess and who for that reason deserved a better fate is moving beyond compare  Atqui non massica Bacchi  Munera non illis epulae nocuere repostae  Frondibus et vitu pascuntur simplicis herbae  Pocula sunt fontes liquidi atque exercita cursu  Flumina nec somnos abrumpit cura salubres  OF English poets perhaps none have excelled the ingenious Mr Dyer in this oblique instruction into which he frequently steals imperceptibly in his little descriptive poem entitled GRONGAR HILL where he disposes every object so as it may give occasion for some observation on human life Denham himself is not superiour to this neglected author in this particular After painting a landschape very extensive and diversified he adds  Thus is nature's vesture wrought  To instruct our wandring thought  Thus she dresses green and gay  To disperse our cares away  Another view from his favourite spot gives him an opportunity for sliding into the following moralities  In this light also his poem on the Ruins of Rome deserves a perusal Dodsley's Miscell Vol Pag  How close and small the hedges lie  What streaks of meadows cross the eye  A step methinks may pass the stream  So little distant dangers seem  So we mistake the future's face  Ey'd through Hope's deluding glass  As yon summits soft and fair  Clad in colours of the air  Which to those who journey near  Barren and brown and rough appear  Still we tread the same coarse way  The present's still a cloudy day  THE unexpected insertion of such reflections imparts to us the same pleasure that we feel when in wandering through a wilderness or grove we suddenly behold in the turning of the walk a statue of some VIRTUE or MUSE  IT may be observed in general that description of the external beauties of nature is usually the first effort of a young genius before he hath studied manners and passions Some of Milton's most early as well as most exquisite pieces are his Lycidas L'Allegro and Il Penseroso if we may except his Ode on the Nativity of Christ which is indeed prior in the order of time and in which a penetrating critic might have discovered the seeds of that boundless imagination which was one day to produce the Paradise Lost This ode which by the way is not sufficiently read or admired is also of the descriptive kind but the objects of his description are great and striking to the imagination the false gods and goddesses of the Heathen forsaking their temples on the birth of our saviour divination and oracles at an end which facts though perhaps not historically true are poetically beautiful  The lonely mountains o'er  And the resounding shore  A voice of weeping heard and loud lament  From haunted spring and dale  Edg'd with poplar pale  The parting Genius is with sighing sent  With flowerenwoven tresses torn  The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thicket mourn  On the morning of Christ's nativity Newton's edition octavo Vol pag of the miscellaneous poems  The lovers of poetry and to such only I write will not be displeased at my presenting them also with the following image which is so strongly conceived that methinks I see at this instant the daemon it represents  And sullen Moloch fled  Hath left in shadows dread  His burning idol all of blackest hue  In vain with cimbals ring  They call the griesly king  In dismal dance about the furnace blue  See also verses written at a Solemn music and on the Passion in the same volume and a vacation exercise pag in all which are to be found many strokes of the sublime  Attention is irresistibly awoke and engaged by that air of solemnity and enthusiasm that reigns in the following stanzas  The oracles are dumb  Pag  No voice or hideous hum  Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving  No nightly trance or breathed spell  Inspires the paleey'd priest from the prophetic cell  Such is the power of true poetry that one is almost inclined to believe the superstitions here alluded to to be real and the succeeding circumstances make one start and look around  In consecrated earth  And on the holy hearth  The lars and lemurs moan with midnight plaint  In urns and altars round  A drear and dying sound  Affrights the flamens at their service quaint  Methinks we behold the priests interrupted in the middle of the secret ceremonies they were performing  "in their temples dim"  gazing with ghastly eyes on each other and terrified and wondering from whence these aërial voices should proceed I have dwelt  chiefly on this ode as much less celebrated than L'Allegro and Il Pensoroso which are now universally known but which by a strange fatality lay in a sort of obscurity the private enjoyment of a few curious readers till they were set to admirable music by Mr Handel And indeed this Volume of Milton's miscellaneous poems has not till very lately met with suitable regard Shall I offend any rational admirer of POPE by remarking that these juvenile descriptive poems of Milton as well as his latin elegies are of a strain far more exalted than any the former author can boast Let me add at the same time what justice obliges me to add that they are far more incorrect For in the very ode before us occur one or two passages that are puerile and affected to a degree not to be parallelled in the purer but less elevated compositions of POPE The season being winter Milton has said that in honour to Jesus  Nature in awe to him  Had dofft her gawdy trim  And afterwards observes in a very epigrammatic and very forced thought unsuitable to the dignity of the subject and of the rest of the ode that  "she wooed the air to hide her guilty front with innocent show"  And on her naked shame  Milton's Miscellaneous Poems vol pag  Pollute with sinful blame  The saintly veil of maiden white to throw  Confounded that her maker's eyes  Should look so near upon her foul deformities  "C'est assez to apply the words of the sensible Voltaire d'avoir cru appercevoir quelques erreurs d'invention dans ce grand genie c'est une consolation pour un esprit aussi bornè que le mien d'etre bien persuadé que les plus grands hommes se trompent comme le vulgaire"  IT would be unpardonable to conclude these remarks on descriptive poesy without taking notice of the SEASONS of Thomson who had peculiar and powerful talents for  this species of composition Let the reader therefore pardon a digression if such it be on his merits and character Thomson was blessed with a strong and copious fancy he hath enriched poetry with a variety of new and original images which he painted from nature itself and from his own actual observations his descriptions have therefore a distinctness and truth which are utterly wanting to those of poets who have only copied from each other and have never looked abroad on the objects themselves Thomson was accustomed to wander away into the country for days and for weeks attentive to  "each rural sight each rural sound"  while many a poet who has dwelt for years in the Strand has attempted to describe fields and rivers and generally succeeded accordingly Hence that nauseous repetition of the same circumstances hence that disgusting impropriety of introducing what may be called a set of hereditary images without proper regard to the age or climate or occasion in which they were formerly used Though the diction of  the SEASONS is sometimes harsh and inharmonious and sometimes turgid and obscure and though in many instances the numbers are not sufficiently diversified by different pauses yet is this poem on the whole from the numberless strokes of nature in which it abounds one of the most captivating and amusing in our language and which as its beauties are not of a fugacious kind as depending on particular customs and manners will ever be perused with delight The scenes of Thomson are frequently as wild and romantic as those of Salvator Rosa pleasingly varied with precipices and torrents and  "castled cliffs"  and deep vallies with piny mountains and the gloomiest caverns Innumerable are the little circumstances in his descriptions totally unobserved by all his predecessors What poet hath ever taken notice of the leaf that towards the end of autumn  Incessant rustles from the mournful grove  Ver  Oft startling such as studious walk below  And slowly circles through the waving air  Or who in speaking of a summer evening hath ever mentioned  The quail that clamours for his running mate  Or the following natural image at the same time of the year  Wide o'er the thistly lawn as swells the breeze  A whitening shower of vegetable down  Amusive floats  Ver    Where do we find the silence and expectation that precedes an April shower insisted on as in ver of SPRING or where  The stealing shower is scarce to patter heard  By such as wander through the forest walks  Beneath th'umbrageous multitude of leaves  Ver  How full particular and picturesque is this assemblage of circumstances that attend a very keen frost in a night of winter  Loud rings the frozen earth and hard reflects  A double noise while at his evening watch  The village dog deters the nightly thief  The heifer lows the distant waterfall  Swells in the breeze and with the hasty tread  Of traveller the hollowsounding plain  Shakes from afar  Winter Ver    In no one subject are common poets more confused and unmeaning than in their descriptions of rivers which are generally said only to wind and to murmur while their qualities and courses are seldom accurately marked examine the exactness of the ensuing description and consider what a perfect idea it communicates to the mind  Around th' adjoining brook that purls along  The vocal grove now fretting o'er a rock  Now scarcely moving through a reedy pool  Now starting to a sudden stream and now  Gently diffus'd into a limpid plain  A various groupe the herds and flocks compose  Rural confusion  Summer Ver    A groupe worthy the pencil of Giacomo da Bassano and so minutely delineated that he might have worked from this sketch  On the grassy bank  Some ruminating lie while others stand  Half in the flood and often bending sip  The circling surface  He adds that the ox in the middle of them  From his sides  The troublous insects lashes to his sides  Returning still  Summer Ver et seq    A natural circumstance that to the best of my remembrance hath escaped even the natural Theocritus Nor do I recollect that any poet hath been struck with the murmurs of the numberless insects that swarm abroad at the noon of a summer's day as attendants of the evening indeed they have been mentioned  Resounds the living surface of the ground  Nor undelightful is the ceaseless hum  To him who muses through the woods at noon  Or drowsy shepherd as he lies reclin'd  With halfshut eyes  Summer Ver    But the novelty and nature we admire in the descriptions of Thomson is by no means his only excellence he is equally to be praised for impressing on our minds the effects which the scene delineated would have on the present spectator or hearer Thus having spoken of the roaring of the savages in the wilderness of Africa he introduces a captive who though just escaped from  Ver  prison and slavery under the tyrant of Morocco is so terrified and astonished at the dreadful uproar that  The wretch half wishes for his bonds again  Thus also having described a caravan lost and overwhelmed in one of those whirlwinds that so frequently agitate and lift up the whole sands of the desart he finishes his picture by adding that  In Cairo's crouded street  Summer Ver  Th'impatient merchant wondering waits in vain  And Mecca saddens at the long delay  And thus lastly in describing the pestilence that destroyed the British troops at the siege of Carthagena he has used a circumstance inimitably lively picturesque and striking to the imagination for he says that the admiral not only heard the groans of the sick that echoed from ship to ship but that he also pensively stood and listened at midnight to the dashing of the waters occasioned by throwing the dead bodies into the sea  Heard nightly plung'd into the sullen waves  The frequent corse  Ver    A minute and particular enumeration of circumstances judiciously selected is what chiefly discriminates poetry from history and renders the former for that reason a more close and faithful representation of nature than the  latter And if our poets would accustom themselves to contemplate fully every object before they attempted to describe it they would not fail of giving their readers more new images than they generally do  A summer evening for instance after a shower has been frequently described but never that I can recollect so justly as in the following lines whose greatest beauty is that hinted above a simple enumeration of the appearances of nature and of what is actually to be seen at such a time They are not unworthy the correct and pure Tibullus  Vespere sub verno tandem actis imbribus aether  Guttatim sparsis rorat apertus aquis  Aureus abrupto curvamine desuper arcus  Fulget et ancipiti lumine tingit agros  Continuò sensus pertentat frigoris aura  Vivida et insinuans mulcet amaenus odor  Pallentes sparsim accrescunt per pascua fungi  Laetius et torti graminis herba viret  Plurimus annosâ decussus ab arbore limax  In putri lentum tramite sulcat iter  Splendidus accendit per dumos lampada vermis  Roscida dum tremulâ semita luce micat  These are the particular circumstances that usually succeed a shower at that season and yet these are new and untouched by any other writer The Carmina Quadragesimalia volume the second printed at Oxford from whence this is transcribed page contain many copies of exquisite descriptive poetry in a genuine classical style See particularly The Rivers page The Morning page The House of Care from Spenser page The Mahometan paradise page The Trees of different soils page The Bird's nest page Geneva page Virgil's tomb page The Indian page The House of Discord page Columbus first discovering the land of the West Indies page c  THESE observations on Thomson which however would not have been so large if there had been already any considerable criticism on his character might be still augmented by an examination and developement of the beauties in the Loves of the birds in SPRING verse A view of the torrid zone in SUMMER verse The rise of fountains and rivers in AUTUMN verse A man perishing in the snows in WINTER verse and the wolves descending from the Alps and and a view of winter within the polar circle verse which are all of them highly finished originals excepting a few of those blemishes intimated above WINTER is in my apprehension the most valuable of these four poems the scenes of it like those of Il Penseroso of Milton being of that awful and  solemn and pensive kind on which a great genius best delights to dwell  MR POPE it seems was of opinion that descriptive poetry is a composition as absurd as a feast made up of sauces and I know many other persons that think meanly of it I will not presume to say it is equal either in dignity or utility to those compositions that lay open the internal constitution of man and that IMITATE characters manners and sentiments I may however remind such contemners of it that in a sisterart landschapepainting claims the very next rank to historypainting being ever preferred to single portraits to pieces of stilllife to droll figures to fruit and flowerpieces that Titian thought it no diminution of his genius to spend much of his time in works of the former species and that if their principles lead them to condemn Thomson they must also condemn the Georgics of Virgil and the greatest part of the noblest descriptive poem extant I mean that of Lucretius  WE are next to speak of the LYRIC pieces of POPE He used to declare that if Mr Dryden had finished a translation of the Iliad he would not have attempted one after so great a master he might have said with more propriety I will not write a musicode after Alexander's Feast which the variety and harmony of its numbers and the beauty and force of its images have conspired to place at the head of modern lyric compositions This of Mr POPE is however indisputably the second of the kind  The inferiority of Addison's ODE to POPE on this subject is manifest and remarkable What prosaic tameness and insipidity do we meet with in the following lines  Cecilia's name does all our numbers grace  From every voice the tuneful accents fly  In soaring trebles now it rises high  And now it sinks and dwells upon the base  This almost descends to burlesque What follows is hardly rhyme and surely not poetry  Consecrate the place and day  To music and Cecilia  Music the greatest  good  that mortals know  Music can noble  hints  impart  There follows in this stanza which is the third a description of a subject very trite Orpheus drawing the beasts about him POPE shewed his superior judgment in taking no notice of this old story and selecting a more new as well as more striking incident in the life of Orpheus It was the custom of this time for almost every rhymer to try his hand in an ode on St Cecilia we find many despicable rapsodies so called in Tonson's Miscellanies We have therefore also preserved another and an earlier ode of Dryden on this subject One stanza of which I cannot forbear inserting in this note It was set to music by I Baptista Dragh  What passion cannot music raise and quell  When Jubal struck the chorded shell  His list'ning brethren stood around  And wond'ring on their faces fell  To worship that celestial sound  Less than a god they thought there could not dwell  Within the hollow of that shell  That spoke so sweetly and so well  What passion cannot music raise and quell  This is so complete and engaging a historypiece that I knew a person of taste who was resolved to have it executed if an artist could have been found on one side of his salloon In which case said he the painter has nothing to do but to substitute colours for words the design being finished to his hands The reader doubtless observes the fine effect of the repetition of the last line as well as the stroke of nature in making these rude hearers imagine some god lay concealed in this first musician's instrument  "propior tamen primo quam  tertio"  to use an expression of Quintilian The first stanza is almost a perfect concert of itself every different instrument is described  and illustrated in numbers that admirably represent and correspond to its different qualities and genius The beginning of the second stanza on the power which music exerts over the passions is a little flat and by no means equal to the conclusion of that stanza The animating song that Orpheus sung to the Argonauts copied from Valerius Flaccus for that of Apollonius is of a different nature is the happily chosen subject of the fourth On hearing which  Each chief his sevenfold shield display'd  And half unsheath'd the shining blade  Which effects of the song however lively do not equal the force and spirit of what Dryden ascribes to the song of his Grecian artist for when Timotheus cries out REVENGE raises the furies and calls up to Alexander's view a troop of Grecian ghosts that were slain and left unburied inglorious and forgotten each of them waving a torch in his hand and pointing to the hostile temples of the Persians and demanding vengeance of their prince he  instantly started from his throne  Seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to destroy  while Thais and the attendant princes rushed out with him to set fire to the city The whole train of imagery in this stanza is alive sublime and animated to an unparallelled degree the poet had so strongly possessed himself of the action described that he places it fully before the eyes of the reader  THE descent of Orpheus into hell is gracefully introduced in the fourth stanza as it naturally flowed from the subject of the preceding one the description of the infernal regions is well imagined and the effects of the musician's lyre on the inhabitants of hell are elegantly translated from the fourth Georgic of Virgil  Ver  and happily adapted to the subject in question The supplicating song at the beginning of the sixth stanza is highly pathetic and poetical especially when he conjures the powers below  By the hero's armed shades  Glittering through the gloomy glades  By the youths that dy'd for love  Wand'ring in the myrtle grove  These images are picturesque and appropriated and these are such notes as might  Draw iron tears down Pluto's cheek  Milton's Il Penseroso  And make hell grant what love did seek  But the numbers that conclude this stanza are of so burlesque and ridiculous a kind and have so much the air of an Hudibrastic song at a county election that one is amazed and concerned to find them in a serious ode and in an ode of a writer eminently skilled in general in accommodating his sounds to his sentiments  Thus song could prevail  O'er death and o'er hell  A conquest how hard and how glorious  Tho' fate had fast bound her  With Styx nine times round her  Yet music and love were victorious  One would imagine that John Dennis or some hero of the Dunciad had been here attempting to travesty this description of the restoration of Eurydice to life It is observable that this is the very measure Addison thought was proper to use in the comic character of Sir Trusty by the introduction of which he has so strangely debased and degraded his opera of Rosamond  How unhappy is he  That is ty'd to a she  And fam'd for his wit and his beauty  For of us pretty fellows  Our wives are so jealous  They ne'er have enough of our duty  Act I Scene II See also Scene IV Act I A song of Grideline and Trusty Act III Scene IV  These numbers therefore according to Addison's ear conveyed a low and ludicrous idea instead of being expressive of triumph and exultation the images here intended to be impressed by POPE  VIRGIL is again imitated throughout the  sixth stanza which describes the behaviour of Orpheus on the second loss of Eurydice I wish POPE had inserted that striking circumstance so strongly imagined of a certain melancholy murmur or rather dismal shriek that was heard all around the lakes of Avernus the moment Orpheus looked back on his wife  Terque fragor stagnis auditus Avernis  Georgic  And as prosopopeias are a great beauty in lyric poetry surely he should not have omitted those natural and pathetic exclamations of Eurydice the moment she was snatched back and which she uttered as she was gradually sinking to the shades especially where she movingly takes her last adieu  Jamque vale  And adds that she is now surrounded with a vast darkness  "feror ingenti circumdata  nocte"  and in vain stretching out her feeble arms towards him  Invalidasque tibi tendens heu non tua palmas  Ver  This lively and pathetic attitude would have shone under the hands of POPE The reader I presume feels the effect of the judicious placing in the verse  heu non tua  and of its repetition after  tibi  The places in which Orpheus according to POPE made his lamentations are not so wild so savage and dismal as those mentioned by Virgil to introduce him  "beside the falls of fountains"  conveys not such an image of desolation and despair as the caverns on the banks of Strymon and Tanais the Hyperborean desarts and the Riphaean solitudes And to say of Hebrus only that it  "rolls in meanders"  is flat and frigid and does not heighten the melancholy of the place There is an antithesis in the succeeding lines  "he glows amid Rhodope's snows"  which I hope the  poet did not intend as it would be a trivial and puerile conceit The death of Orpheus is expressed with a beautiful brevity and abruptness suitable to the nature of the ode  Hark Haemus resounds with the Bacchanals cries  Ah see he dies  Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he  sung  Where instead of  sung  Virgil says  vocabat  which is more natural and tender and Virgil adds a very moving epithet that he called  miseram  Eurydicen I am sensible POPE never intended an exact translation of the passages of the Georgics here alleged I only hint that in my humble judgment he has omitted some of the most striking incidents in the story I have lately seen a manuscript ode entitled  "On the Use and Abuse of Poetry"  in which Orpheus in considered in another and a higher light according to ancient mythology as the first legislator and civilizer of mankind I shall here insert a stanza of it containing part of what relates to this subject  ANTISTROPHE II  Such was wise Orpheus' moral song  The lonely cliffs and caves among  From hollow oak or mountainden  He drew the naked gazing men  Or where in turfbuilt sheds or rushy bowers  They shiver'd in cold wintry showers  Or sunk in heapy snows  Then sudden while his melting music stole  With powerful magic o'er each softening soul  Society and law and sacred order rose  EPODE II  Father of peace and arts he first the city built  No more the neighbour's blood was by his neighbour spilt  He taught to till and separate the lands  He fix'd the roving youths in Hymen's myrtle bands  Whence dear domestic life began  And all the charities that soften'd man  The babes that in their father's faces smil'd  With lisping blandishments their rage beguil'd  And tender thoughts inspir'dc  I am not permitted to transcribe any more and therefore return to POPE again  THE beginning of the last stanza of the ode here examined seems to be a repetition of the  subject of the second the power of music over the passions which may perhaps be reckoned a blameable tautology especially as these lines  Music the fiercest grief can charm  And fate's severest rage disarm  Music can soften pain to ease  And make despair and madness please  are inferior I am afraid to the former on the same subject which contain beautiful and poetical personifications  Melancholy lifts her head  Morpheus rouses from his bed  Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes  Listning Envy drops her snakes  Intestine war no more our passions wage  And giddy factions hear away their rage  It is observable that this ode of POPE and the Alexander's Feast of Dryden both of them conclude with an epigram of four lines a species of wit as flagrantly unsuitable to the dignity and as foreign to the nature of the lyric as it is of the epic muse  IT is to be regretted that Mr Handel has not set to music the former as well as the latter of these celebrated odes in which he has displayed the combined powers of verse and voice to a wonderful degree No poem indeed affords so much various matter for a composer to work upon as Dryden has here introduced and expressed all the greater passions and as the transitions from one to the other are sudden and impetuous Of which we feel the effects in the pathetic description of the fall of Darius that immediately succeeds the joyous praises of Bacchus The symphony and air particularly that accompanies the four words  "fallen fallen fallen fallen"  is strangely moving  The mention of this pathetic air reminds me of a story of the celebrated Lully who having been one day accused of never setting any thing to music but the languid verses of Quinault was immediately animated with the reproach and as it were seized with a kind of enthusiasm he ran instantly to his harpsichord and striking a few cords sung in recitative these four lines in the Iphigenia of Racine which are full of the strongest imagery and are therefore much more difficult to express in music than verses of mere sentiment  Un prêtre environné d'une foule cruelle  Portera sur ma fille une main criminelle  Dechirera son sein et d'un oeil curieux  Dans fon coeur palpitant consultera les dieux  One of the company has often declared that they all thought themselves present at this dreadful spectacle and that the notes with which Lully accompanied these words erected the hair of their heads with horror  The opinion of Boileau concerning music is remarkable he asserts qu'on ne peut jamais faire un bon opera parceque la musique ne sauroit narrer que les passions n'y peuvent etre peintes dans toute l'etenduë qu'elles demandent que d'ailleurs elle ne sauroit souvent mettre en chant les expressions vraiment sublimes et courageuses  and consists of a few  simple and touching notes without any of those intricate variations and affected divisions into which in compliance with a vicious and vulgar taste this great master hath sometimes descended Even this piece of Handel so excellent on the whole is not free from one or two blemishes of this sort particularly in the air  "with ravish'd ears"  c  THE moderns have perhaps practised no species of poetry with so little success and with such indisputable inferiority to the ancients  as the ODE which seems owing to the harshness and untuneableness of modern languages abounding in monosyllables and crowded with consonants This particularly is the case of the English whose original is Teutonic and which therefore is not so musical as the Italian the Spanish or even the French as not having so great a quantity of words derived from the Latin But the Latin language itself as well as all others must yield to the unparalled sweetness and copiousness of the Greek  "Tantò est sermo graecus latino jucundior says Quintilian in his twelfth book ut nostri poetae quoties dulce carmen esse voluerunt illorum id nominibus exornent"  He gives some instances that are curious and worth attention Quid quod pleraque nos illa quasi mugiente literà cludimus M quâ nullum Graecè verbum cadit At illi N jucundam et in fine praecipuè quasi tinnientem illius loco ponunt quae est apud nos rarissimè in clausulis Quid quod syllabae nostrae in B literam et D innituntur adeò asperè ut plerique non antiquissimorum quidem sed tamen veterum mollire tentaverint non solum  aversa  pro  adversis  dicendo sed et in praepositione B literae absonam et ipsam S subjiciendo Apply these observations with proper alterations to the English tongue Quintil l xii c  What line even in the Italian poets is so soft and mellifluous as  Odys  or as in the tender Bion  to instance in no more If we cast a transient view over the most celebrated of the modren lyrics we may observe that the stanza of Petrarch which has been adopted by all his successors displeases the ear by its tedious uniformity and by the number of identical cadences And indeed to speak truth there appears to be little valuable in Petrarch except the purity of his diction His sentiments even of love are metaphysical and far fetched neither is there much variety in his subjects or fancy in his method of treating them Metastasio is a much better lyric poet When Boileau attempted an ode he exhibited a glaring proof of what will be more fully insisted on in the course of this Essay that the writer whose grand characteristical talent is  satyric or moral poetry will never succeed with equal merit in the higher branches of this art In his ode on the taking Namur are instances of the  An instance of the FIRST is to be found in the third stanza Of the SECOND in the ninth stanza  Qui domta Lille Contrai  Gand la superbe Espagnole  Saint Omer Bezancon Dole  Ypres Mastricht et Cambrai  Of the THIRD sort is his making a star or comet fatal to his enemies of the white feather which the king usually wore in his hat  BOMBASTIC of the PROSAIC and of the PUERILE And it is no small confirmation of the ruling passion of this author that he could not conclude his ode but with a severe stroke on his old antagonist Perrault though the majesty of this species of compositions is so much injured by descending to personal satire The name of Malherbe is respectable as he was the first reformer of the French poesy and the first who gave his countrymen any idea of a legitimate ode though his own pieces have hardly any thing but harmony to recommend them The odes of la Motte are fuller of delicate  sentiment and philosophical reflection than of imagery of figures and poetry There are particular stanzas eminently good but not one entire ode Some of Rousseau particularly that to Fortune and some of his psalms and one or two of Voltaire particularly to the king of Prussia on his accession to the throne and on Meaupertuis's travels to the north to measure the degrees of the meridian towards the equator seem to rise above that correct mediocrity which distinguishes the lyric poetry of the French In this ode of Voltaire we find a prosopopeia of Americus and afterwards a speech of Newton on the design of this traveller and his companions that approach to the sublime  Comme ils parloient ainsi Newton dans l'empirée  Newton les regardoit et du ciel entr'ouvert  Confirmez disoit il a la terre eclairée  Ce que j'ai decouvert  I hope I shall not transgress a very sensible observation of Mr POPE who would have a true critic be  Still pleas'd to praise yet not afraid to blame  if I should say we have lately seen two or three lyric pieces superiour to any he has left us I mean an Ode on Lyric Poetry and another to Lord Huntingdon by Doctor Akenside and a Chorus of British Bards by Mr Gilbert West at the end of the Institution of the Order of the Garter Both these are written with regular returns of the Strophe Antistrophe and Epode which gives a truely Pindaric variety to the numbers that is wanting not only to the best French and Italian but even to the best Latin odes In the pieces here commended the figures are strong and the transitions bold and there is a just mixture of sentiment and imagery and particularly they are animated with a noble spirit of liberty I must refer the reader to the characters of Alcaeus and of Milton in the two first and to the stanza of Mr West's ode on the barons procuring magna charta which I chuse to give at length because it contains almost all  the different measures of which the English language seems capable  On yonder plain  Along whose willowfringed side  The silverfooted Naids sportive train  Down the smooth Thames amid the cygnets glide  I saw when at thy reconciling word  Injustice anarchy intestine jarr  Despotic insolence the wasting sword  And all the brazen throats of civil war  Were hush'd in peace from his impetuous throne  Hurl'd furious down  Abash'd dismay'd  Like a chas'd lion to the savage shade  Of his own forests fell Oppression fled  With vengeance brooding in his sullen breast  Then Justice fearless rais'd her decent head  Heal'd every grief each wrong redrest  While round her valiant squadrons stood  And bade her awful tongue demand  From vanquish'd John's reluctant hand  The DEED OF FREEDOM purchas'd with their blood  Dodsley's Miscellanies vol ii pag  See also in the same volume an excellent ode of Mr Cobb  THE next LYRIC compositions of Pope are two choruses inserted in a very heavy tragedy altered from Shakespear by the Duke of Buckingham in which we see that the most accurate observation of dramatic rules without genius is of no effect These choruses are  extremely elegant and harmonious but are they not chargeable with the fault which Aristotle imputes to many of Euripides that they are foreign and adventitious to the subject and contribute nothing towards the advancement of the main action Whereas the chorus ought    to be a part or member of the one Whole cooperate with it and help to accelarate the intended event as is constantly adds the philosopher the practise of Sophocles Whereas these reflections of POPE on the baneful influences of war on the arts and learning and on the universal power of love seem to be too general are not sufficiently appropriated do not rise from the subject and occasion and might be inserted with equal propriety in twenty other tragedies This remark of Aristotle tho he does not himself produce any examples may be verified from the following among many others In the Phoenicians of Euripides they sing  a long and very beautiful but ill placed hymn to Mars I speak of that which begins so nobly  v  "O woeful Mars why art thou still delighted with blood and with death and why an enemy to the feasts of Bacchus"  And a still more glaring instance may be brought from the end of the third act of the Troades in which the story of Ganymede is introduced not very artificially  v  To these may be added that exquisite ode in praise of Apollo descriptive of his birth and victories which we find about the middle of the last act of the Iphigenia in Tauris  v seq  ON the other hand the choruses of Sophocles never desert the subject of each particular drama and all their sentiments and reflections are drawn from the situation of the principal personage of the fable Nay Sophocles hath  artfully found a method of making those poetical descriptions with which the choruses of the ancients abound carry on the chief design of the peice and has by these means accomplished what is a great difficulty in writing tragedy has united poetry with propriety In the  The subject and scene of this tragedy so romantic and uncommon are highly pleasing to the imagination See particularly his description of his being left in this desolate island v his lamentation for the loss of his bow v and also and his last adieu to the island One may here observe by the way that the ancients thought bodily pains and wounds c proper objects to be represented on the stage  Philoctetes the chorus takes a natural occasion at verse to give a minute and moving picture of the solitary life of that unfortunate hero and when afterwards at verse pain has totally exhausted the strength and spirits of Philoctetes and it is necessary for the plot of the tragedy that he should fall asleep it is then that the chorus breaks out into an exquisite ode to sleep As in the Antigone with equal beauty and decorum in an address to the god of love at verse of that play And thus lastly when  the birth of Edipus is doubtful and his parents unknown the chorus suddenly exclaims  "  From which O my son of the immortal gods didst thou spring Was it some nymph afavourite of Pan that haunts the mountains or some daughter of Apollo for this god loves the remote rocks and caverns or was it Mercury who reigns in Cyllene or did Bacchus  a god who dwells on the tops of the mountains beget you on any of the nymphs that frequent Helicon with whom he frequently sports"    THE judicious author of the tragedy of Elfrida hath given occasion to a kind of controversy among the more curious critics concerning the utility of the chorus which after the model of the ancients he hath endeavoured to revive To imagine that the great Grecian masters retained it only out of respect to its antiquity and from no intrinsic  valuableness or propriety of the thing can scarcely be imagined The sentiments of the excellent Brumoy are moderate and rational and seem to comprehend all that is necessary to be said on this subject  "I know says he the chorus is attended with inconveniences and that it has sometimes compelled the ancients to violate probability but it notwithstanding is apparent by the use they sometimes made of it that its advantages exceed its inconveniences Sophocles had the address to withdraw his chorus for a few moments when their absence was necessary as in the Ajax If the chorus therefore incommodes the poet and puts him under difficulties he must charge it solely to his own want of dexterity What advantage on the other hand may he not reap from a body of actors that fill the stage that render more lively striking and sensible the continuity of the action and give it the air of greater PROBABILITY since it is not natural or conceivable that a great and illustrious action  such as a revolution in a state should pass without witnesses We perceive and feel a kind of void on our stage on account of the absence of choruses and the successful attempt of Racine who adopted and revived the use of them in his ATHALIA and ESTHER were sufficient one would imagine to undeceive and convince us of their importance and utility The banishment of the chorus has been the necessary consequence of the custom of the moderns to take for their representations ALL kinds of subjects whereas the ancients treated only such actions as were publicly transacted and to fill and indeed overcharge the action with incidents and surprizes For how could these subjects and these various crowded events and incidents have been possibly introduced in a public place exposed to the view of courtiers and the people while the generality of our tragedies turn on particular and private affairs ou la cour et le peuple n'entrent souvent pour rien the Athenian spectators were ever accustomed to concern  themselves in all public affairs and to be witnesses and judges of them The modern stage by its disuse of the chorus may perhaps have gained a great number of fine subjects for tragedy yet in return it is burthened with confidents it looses the continuity of action and is deprived of the magnificent spectacle that serves to support that action and which is if I may be allowed the expression le  fonds  ou l  'accompagnement  du tableau"  Le Theatre de Grecs Tom and  I THOUGHT it more equitable as well as more convincing to quote at large the words of this admirable critic whose work is one of the most valuable that his elegant nation hath produced than to adopt as some have done with small variations his opinion without acknowledging the debt An apology would be necessary for this digression if it was not my professed design in this Essay to expatiate into such occasional disquisitions as  naturally arise from the subject it has however kept us too long from surveying a valuable literary curiosity I mean the earliest production of POPE written when he was not twelve years old his ODE ON SOLITUDE The first sketches of such an artist ought highly to be prized Different geniuses unfold themselves at different periods of life In some minds the ore is a long time in ripening Not only inclination but opportunity and encouragement a proper subject or a proper patron influence the exertion or the suppression of genius These stanzas on Solitude are a strong instance of that contemplative and moral turn which was the distinguishing characteristic of our poet's mind An ode of Cowley which he produced at the age of thirteen years is of the same cast and perhaps not in the least inferior to this of POPE The voluminous Lopez de Vega is commonly but I fear incredibly reported by the Spaniards to have composed verses when he was five years old and Torquato Tasso the second  of the Italian poets for that wonderful original Dante is the first is said to have recited poems and orations of his writing when he was seven It is however certain which is more extraordinary that he produced his Rinaldo in his eighteenth year no bad precursor to the Gierusalemma Liberata and no small effort of that genius which was one day to shew how fine an epic poem the Italian language notwithstanding the vulgar imputation of effeminacy was capable of producing  THOSE who are fond of biographical anecdotes which are some of the most amusive and instructive parts of history will be perhaps pleased with the following particulars in the life of POPE He frequently declared that the time of his beginning to write verses was so very early in his life that he could scarcely recal it to his memory When he was yet a child his father who had been a merchant in London and retired to Binfield with about twenty thousand pounds would frequently  order him to make English verses It seems he was difficult to be pleased  See his Works vol pag  and would make the lad correct them again and again When at last he approved them he took great pleasure in perusing them and would say  "these are good RHYMES"  These early praises of a tender and respected parent cooperating with the natural inclination of the son may possibly be the causes that fixed our young bard in a resolution of becoming eminent in this art He was taught to read very early by an aunt and of his own indefatigable industry learned to write by copying printed books which he executed with great neatness and exactness When he was eight years old he was put under the direction of one Taverner a priest who taught him the rudiments of the latin and greek tongues together About this time he accidentally met with Ogilby's translation of Homer which notwithstanding the deadness and insipidity of the versification arrested  his attention by the force of the story The Ovid of Sandys fell next in his way and it is said that the raptures these translations gave him were so strong that he spoke of them with pleasure to the period of his life About ten being now at school at Hidepark corner whither he went from a popish seminary at Twiford near Winchester he was carried sometimes to the playhouse and being struck we may imagine with theatrical representations he turned the chief events into a kind of play made up of a number of speeches from Ogilby's translation connected with verses of his own He persuaded the upper boys to act this piece which from its curiosity one would have been glad to have beheld The master's gardener represented the character of Ajax and the actors were dressed after the pictures of his favourite Ogilby far the best part of that book as they were designed and engraved by artists of note At twelve he retired with his father into WindsorForest and it was there he first perused the writings of Waller of Spenser  and of Dryden The second is said to have made a poet of Cowley that Ogilby should give our author his first poetic pleasures is a remarkable circumstance On the first sight of Dryden he abandoned the rest having now found an author whose cast was exactly congenial with his own His works therefore he studied with equal pleasure and attention he placed them before his eyes as a model of which more will be said in the course of these papers He copied not only his harmonious versification but the very turns of his periods It was hence he was enabled to give to rhyme all the harmony of which it is capable  See WORKS vol pag  ABOUT this time that is about fifteen years old he began to write his ALCANDER an epic poem of which he himself speaks with so much amiable frankness and ingenuity in a passage restored to his excellent preface to his works  "I confess there was a time when  I was in love with myself and my first productions were the children of selflvoe upon innocence I had made an epic poem and panegyrics on all the princes of Europe and I thought myself the greatest genius that ever was I cannot but regret these delightful visions of my childhood which like the fine colours we see when our eyes are shut are vanished for ever"  Atterbury had perused this early piece and we may gather from one of his letters advised him to burn it though he adds  "I would have interceeded for the first page and put it with your leave among my curiosities"  Nec placet ante annos vates puer omnia justo  Tempore proveniant  Vidae Poet L  I have been credibly informed that some of the anonymous verses quoted as examples of the  Art of Sinking in Poetry  in the incomparable satire so called were such as our poet remembered from his own ALCANDER So sensible of its own errors and imperfections is a mind truly great  QUINTILIAN whose knowledge of human nature was consummate has observed that nothing very correct and faultless is to be expected in very early years from a truly elevated genius that a generous extravagance and exuberance are its proper marks and that a premature exactness is a certain evidence of future flatness and sterility His words are incomparable and worthy consideration  Lib Instit Cap ad init  "Audeat haec aetas plura et INVENIAT et inventis gaudeat sint licet illa non satis interim sicca et severa Facile remedium est ubertatis sterilia nullo labore vincuntur Illa mihi in pueris natura nimium spei dabit in quâ INGENIUM judicio praesumitur Materiam esse primum volo vel abundantiorem atque ultra quam oportet fusam Multum inde decoquent anni multum ratio limabit aliquid velut usu ipso deteretur sit modo unde excidi possit et quod exculpi erit autem si non ab initio tenuem laminam duxerimus et quam  caelatura altior rumpatQuare mihi ne maturitas quidem ipsa festinet nec musta in lacu statim austera sint sic et annos ferent et vetustate proficient"  This is very strong and masculine sense expressed and enlivened by a train of metaphors all of them elegant and well preserved Whether these early productions of POPE would not have appeared to Quintilian to be rather too finished correct and pure and what he would have inferred concerning them is too delicate a subject for me to enlarge upon Let me rather add an entertaining anecdote When Guido and Domenichino had each of them painted a picture in the Church of Saint Andrew Annibal Carrache their master was pressed to declare which of his two pupils had excelled The picture of Guido represented Saint Andrew on his knees before the cross that of Domenichino represented the flagellation of that apostle Both of them in their different kinds were capital pieces and were painted in fresco opposite each other to eternize as it were their rivalship and contention  Guido said Carrache has performed as a master and Domenichino as a scholar But added he the worth of the scholar is more valuable than that of the master In truth one may perceive faults in the picture of Domenichino that Guido has avoided but then there are noble strokes not to be found in that of his rival It was easy to discern a genius that promised to produce beauties to which the sweet the gentle and the graceful Guido would never aspire  The last piece that belongs to this Section is the ODE entitled THE DYING CHRISTIAN TO HIS SOUL written in imitation of the well known sonnet of Hadrian addrest to his departing spirit concerning which it was our author's judicious opinion that the diminutive epithets with which it abounds such as Vagula Blandula were by no means expressions of levity and indifference but rather of endearment of tenderness and concern This ode was written we find at the desire of Steele and our poet in a letter to him on that occasion  says  "You have it as Cowley calls it just warm from the brain it came to me the first moment I waked this morning yet you'll see it was not so absolutely inspiration but that I had in my head not only the verses of Hadrian but the fine fragment of Sappho"  In Longinus sect quoted by him is a model of that sublime which combines together many various and opposite passions and sensations    IT appears however that our author had another composition in his head besides those he here refers to for there is a close and surprising resemblance  See THE ADVENTURER vol II Ed p  between this ode of POPE and one of a very obscure and justly forgotten rhymer of the age of Charles the second namely Thomas Flatman from whose dunghill as well as from the dregs of  Crashaw has very well translated the dies irae to which translation Roscommon is much indebted in his Poem on the day of Judgment  Crashaw of Carew of Herbert and others for it is well known he was a great  reader of all those poets POPE has very judiciously collected gold And the following stanza is perhaps the only valuable one Flatman  Of whom says Lord Rochester  Not that slow drudge in swift Pindaric strains  Flatman who Cowley imitates with pains  And rides a jaded muse whipt with loose reins  has produced  When on my sick bed I languish  Full of sorrow full of anguish  Fainting gasping trembling crying  Panting groaning speechless dying  Methinks I hear some gentle spirit say  Be not fearful come away  The third and fourth lines are eminently good and pathetic and the climax well preserved the very turn of them is closely copied by POPE as is likewise the striking circumstance of the dying man's imagining he hears a voice calling him away  Vital spark of heavenly flame  Quit O quit this mortal frame  Trembling hoping lingring  FLYING has not here any force and does not heighten the sense  flying  O the pain the bliss of dying  Hark they whisper angels say  Sister spirit come away  I AM sensible of the difficulty of distinguishing resemblances from thefts and of what a late critic has urged that a want of seeming originality arises frequently not from a barrenness and timidity of genius but from invincible necessity and the nature of things that the works of those who profess an art whose essence is imitation must needs be stamped with a close resemblance to each other since the objects material or animate extraneous or internal which they all imitate lie equally open to the observation of all and are perfectly similar Descriptions therefore that are faithful and just MUST BE UNIFORM AND ALIKE the first copier may be perhaps entitled to the praise of priority but a succeeding one ought not certainly to be condemned for plagiarism  THESE general observations however true do not I think extend to the case before us because not only the thoughts but even the  words are copied and because the images especially the last are such as are not immediately impressed by sensible objects and which therefore on account of their SINGULARITY did not lie in common for any poet to seize Let us however moderate the matter and say what perhaps is the real fact that POPE fell into the thoughts of Flatman unawares and without design and having formerly read him imperceptibly adopted this passage even without knowing that he had borrowed it That this will frequently happen is evident from the following curious particulars related by Menage  Antibaillet tom II  which because much has been said of late on this head by many writers of criticism I shall here insert  "I have often heard M Chapelain and M Dandilly declare that they wrote the following line"  D'arbires de la paix de foudres de la guerre  without knowing it was in Malherbe and the moment I am making this remark recollect  that the same thing happened to M Furetiere I have often heard Corneille declare that he inserted in his Polyeucte two celebrated lines concerning fortune without knowing they were the property of M Godeau bishop of Vence  Et comme elle a l'eclat du Verre  Elle en a la fragilitè  GODEAU had inserted them in an ode to Cardinal Richleiu fifteen years before Polyeucte was written Porphyry in a fragment of his book on Philology quoted by Eusebius in the tenth book of his  Evangelical preparation  makes mention of an author named Aretatedes who composed an entire treatise on this sort of resemblances And St Jerom relates that his preceptor Donatus explaining that sensible passage in Terence  "Nihil est dictum quod non dictum suit prius"  railed severely at the ancients for taking from his his best thoughts  "Pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt"  MENAGE makes these observations on occasion of a passage in the Poetics of Vida intended to justify borrowing the thoughts and even expressions of others which passage is very applicable to the subject before us  Aspice ut exuvias veterumque insignia nobis  Aptemus rerum accipimus nunc clara reperta  Nunc seriem at{que} animum verborum verba quoque ipsa  Nec pudet interdum alterius nos ore locutos  Lib v  Menage adds that he intended to compile a regular treatise on the thefts and imitations of the poets As his reading was very extensive his work would probably have been very entertaining For surely it is no trivial amusement to trace an applauded

desire of dethroning established  See the fruitless and impudent attack of Lauder on Milton  reputations Thus for instance says the Rambler  N  o    "it can scarcely be doubted that in the first of the following passages POPE remembered OVID and that in the second  The Works of Cardinal Bembo and of Casa of Annibal Caro and Tasso himself are full of entire lines taken from Dante and Petrarch  he copied CRASHAW be+cause there is a concurrence of more resemblances than can be imagined to have happened by chance"  Saepe pater dixit studium quid inutile tentas  Maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes

that POPE has fallen into  The Adventurer N  o    BEN JOHNSON as another ingenious critic has remarked wrote an elegy on the lady  Anne Pawlet Marchioness of Winton the beginning of which POPE seems to have thought of when he wrote his verses to the Memory of an unfortunate lady Johnson begins his elegy  What gentle ghost besprent with April dew  Hayles me so solemnly to yonder yew  And beckoning woes me  In the underwood  In which strain POPE beautifully breaks out  What beck'ning ghost along the moonlight shade  Invites my steps and points to yonder glade  'Tis she  as Johnson now lies before me I may perhaps be pardoned for pointing out another passage in him which POPE probably remembered when he wrote the following  From shelves to shelves see greedy Vulcan roll  And lick up all their physic of the soul  Dunciad  Thus Johnson speaking of a parcel of books  These hadst thou pleas'd either to dine or sup  Had made a meale for Vulcan to lick up  See OBSERVATIONS on the FAERY QUEEN of Spenser by Thomas Warton Sect vii p  I SHOULD be sensibly touched at the injurious imputation of so ungenerous and indeed impotent a design as that of attempting to diminish or fully the reputation of so valuable a writer as POPE by the most distant hint or accusation of his being a plagiary a writer to whom the English poesy and the English language is everlastingly indebted but we may say of his imitations what his poetical father Dryden said of another who deserved not such a panegyric so justly as our author  "HE INVADES AUTHORS LIKE A MONARCH AND WHAT WOULD BE THEFT IN OTHER

commentary at the bottom of each page of his works the many lines he has borrowed from Horace and Juvenal were grossly deceived The verses of the ancients which this poet hath turned into French with

Ultraject  SECT III Of the ESSAY on Criticism  WE are now arrived at a poem of that species for which our author's genius was particularly turned the DIDACTIC and the MORAL it is therefore as might be expected a masterpiece in its kind I have been sometimes inclined to think that the praises Addison has bestowed on it  Spectator N  o    were a little partial and invidious  "The observations says he follow one another like those in Horace's Art of Poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer"  It is however certain that the poem before us is by no means destitute of a just integrity and a lucid order each of the precepts and remarks naturally introduce the succeeding ones so as to form an entire whole The ingenious Mr Hurd hath also usefully shewn that  Horace observed a strict method and unity of design in his epistle to the Pisones and that altho the connexions are delicately fine and almost imperceptible like the secret hinges of a wellwrought box yet they artfully and closely unite each part together and give coherence uniformity and beauty to the work The Spectator adds  "The observations in this essay are  some  of them  uncommon  "  there is I fear a small mixture of illnature in these words for this ESSAY tho' on a beaten subject abounds in many new remarks and original rules as well as in many happy and beautiful illustrations and applications of the old ones We are indeed amazed to find such a knowledge of the world such a maturity of judgment and such a penetration into human nature as are here displayed in so very young a writer as was POPE when he produced this ESSAY for he was not twenty years old Correctness and a just taste are usually not attained but by long practice and experience in any art but a clear head and strong sense were  the characteristical qualities of our author and every man soonest displays his radical excellencies If his predominant talent be warmth and vigor of imagination it will break out in fanciful and luxuriant descriptions the colouring of which will perhaps be too rich and glowing If his chief force lies in the understanding rather than in the imagination it will soon appear by solid and manly observations on life or learning expressed in a more chast and subdued style The former will frequently be hurried into obscurity or turgidity and a false grandeur of diction the latter will seldom hazard a figure whose usage is not already established or an image beyond common life will always be perspicuous if not elevated will never disgust if not transport his readers will avoid the grosser faults if not arrive at the greater beauties of composition The  "eloquentiae genus"  for which he will be distinguished will not be the  "plenum erectum audax praecultum"  but the  "pressum  mite limatum"  Quintil l xi c  In the earliest letters of POPE to Wycherly to Walsh and Cromwell we find many admirable and acute judgments of men and books and an intimate acquaintance not only with some of the best Greek and Roman particularly the latter but the most celebrated of the French and Italian classics  DU BOS  Sect x  fixes the period of time at which generally speaking the poets and the painters have arrived at as high a pitch of perfection as their geniuses will permit to be the age of thirty years or a few years more or less Virgil was near thirty when he composed his first Eclogue Horace was a grown man when he began to be talked of at Rome as a poet having been formerly engaged in a busy military life Racine was about the same age when his ANDROMACHE which may be regarded as his first good tragedy was played Corneille was more than thirty  when his CID appeared Despreaux was full thirty when he published his satires such as we now have them Moliere was full forty when he wrote the first of those comedies on which his reputation is founded But to excell in this species of composition it was not sufficient for Moliere to be only a great poet but it was more necessary for him to gain a thorough knowledge of men and the world which is seldom attained so early in life but without which the best poet would be able to write but very indifferent comedies Raphael was about thirty years old also when he displayed the beauty and sublimity of his genius in the Vatican For it is there we behold the first of his works that are worthy the great name he at present so deservedly possesses When our Shakespear wrote his LEAR Milton his PARADISE LOST Spenser his FAIRY QUEEN and Dryden his MUSIC ODE they were all of them past the middle age of man From this short review it appears that few poets ripened so early as POPE who seems literally and strictly to have  fulfilled the precept of Horace in each of it's circumstances  Multa tulit fecitque PUER  he was laborious and indefatigable in his pursuits of learning  Sudavit et alsit  and above all what is of the greatest consequence in preserving each faculty of the mind in due vigour  Abstinuit venere et vino  these are the two temptations to which a youthful bard is principally subject and into whose snares he generally falls If the imagination be lively the passions will be strong True genius seldom resides in a cold and phlegmatic constitution The same temperament and the same sensibility that makes a poet or a painter will be apt to make a man a lover and a debauchee POPE was happily secured from falling into these common failings the bane of so many others by the weakness and  delicacy of his body and the bad state of his health The sensual vices were too violent for so tender a frame he never fell into intemperance and dissipation May I add that even his bodily make was of use to him as a writer for one who was acquainted with the heart of man and the secret springs of our actions has observed with great penetration  "  Bacon's Essays  It is good to consider deformity not as a signe which is more deceivable but as a cause which seldom faileth of the effect Whosoever hath any thing fixed in his person that doth induce contempt hath also a perpetual spur in himselfe to rescue and deliver himself from scorne"  I do not think it improbable that this circumstance might animate our poet to double his diligence to make himself distinguished and hope I shall not be accused by those who have a knowledge of human nature of assigning his desire of excellence to a motive too mean and sordid as well as too weak and inefficacious to operate such an effect  What crops of wit and honesty appear  From spleen from obstinacy hate or fear  See

circumstance equally propitious to the studies of POPE in this early part of his life that he inherited a fortune that was a decent competence and sufficient to supply the small expences which both by constitution and reflection he required He had no occasion to distract his thoughts by being sollicitous  "de lodice paranda"  he needed not to wait  Pour diner le success d'un sonnet  Boileau Art

have brought with him into the country almost  twenty thousand pounds As he was a papist he could not purchase nor put his money to interest on real security and as he adhered to the interests of King James he he made a point of conscience not to lend it to the new government  For right hereditary tax'd and fin'd  He stuck to poverty with peace of mind  he therefore kept this sum in his chest and lived upon the principal till by that time his son came to the succession it was almost all fairly spent There was however enough left to supply the occasions of our author  He afterwards acquired a considerable fortune by his translation of the Iliad which was published for his own benefit by a subscription so large that it does honour to this kingdom Mr Warburton informs us that he sold it to Lintot the bookseller on the following terms twelve hundred pounds paid down and all the books for his subscribers The Odyssey was published in the same manner and sold on the same conditions except only that instead of twelve he had but six hundred pounds He was assisted in this latter work by Broome and Fenton to the first of whom he gave six hundred pounds and to the latter three hundred This translation has proved a good estate to the bookseller  and to keep him from the two most destructive  enemies to a young genius want and dependence  "I can easily conceive says a late moralist that a mind occupied and overwhelmed with the weight and immensity of its own conceptions glancing with astonishing rapidity from heaven to earth and from earth to heaven cannot willingly submit to the dull drudgery of examining the justness and accuracy of a butcher's bill To descend from the widest and comprehensive views of nature and weigh out hops for a brewing must be invincibly disgusting to a true genius to be able to build imaginary palaces of the most exquisite architecture but yet not to pay a carpenter's bill is a cutting mortification and disgrace"  The Adventurer N  o    ON the other hand opulence and high station would be equally pernicious and unfavourable to a young genius as they would almost unavoidably embarrass and immerse him in the cares the pleasures the indolence  and the dissipation that accompany abundance And perhaps the fortune most truly desireable and the situation most precisely proper for a young poet are marked out in that celebrated saying of Charles the ninth of France  "equi et poetae ALENDI sunt non SAGINANDI"  THE ESSAY ON CRITICISM which occasioned the introduction of these reflections was first I am well informed written in prose according to the precept of Vida and the practice of Racine  Quinetiam prius effigiem formare SOLUTIS  Totiusque operis simulacrum fingere verbis  Proderit atque omnes ex ordine nectere partes  Et seriem rerum et certos sibi ponere fines  Per quos tuta regens vestigia tendere pergas  Poetic lib ver  When Racine had fixed on a subject for a play he wrote down in plain prose not only the subject of each of the five acts but of every scene and every speech so that he  could take a view of the whole at once and see whether every part cohered and cooperated to produce the intended event when his matter was thus regularly disposed he was used to say  "My Tragedy is finished"  I NOW propose to make some observations on and illustrations of such passages and precepts in this ESSAY as on account of their utility novelty or elegance deserve particular attention and perhaps I may take the freedom to hint at a few imperfections in this SENSIBLE performance I shall cite the passages in the natural order in which they successively occur    In poets as true genius is but rare  Ver    It is indeed so extremely rare that no country in the succession of many ages has produced above three or four persons that deserve the title The  "man of rhymes"  may be easily found but the genuine poet of a lively plastic imagination the true MAKER  or CREATOR is so uncommon a progidy that one is almost tempted to subscribe to the opinion of Sir William Temple where he says  "That of all the numbers of mankind that live within the compass of a thousand years for one man that is born capable of making a great poet there may be a thousand born capable of making as great generals or ministers of state as the most renowned in story"  Miscell Essay part  There are indeed more causes required to concur to the formation of the former than of the latter which necessarily render it's production more difficult    True taste as seldom is the critic's share  v    La Bruyere says very sensibly I will allow the

musician performs his part well in the hardest symphonies he must necessarily know the notes and understand the rules of harmony and music But must a man therefore who has an ear and has studied the rules of music of necessity have a voice or hand can no one possibly judge a  fiddle  but who is himself a fidler can no  one judge a picture but who is himself a layer of colours  Characteristics v p  Quintilian and Pliny who speak of the works of the ancient painters and statuaries with so much taste and sentiment handled not themselves either the pencil or the chissel nor Longinus nor Dionysius the harp But altho' such as have actually performed nothing in the art itself may not on that account be totally disqualified to judge with accuracy of any piece of workmanship yet perhaps a judgment will come with more authority and force from an artist himself Hence the connoisseurs highly prize the treatise of Rubens concerning the imitation of antique statues the art of painting by Leonardo da Vinci and the lives of the painters by Vasari As for the same reasons Rameau's dissertation on the thorough bass and the introduction to a good taste in music by the excellent but neglected Geminiani demand a particular regard The prefaces of Dryden would be equally valuable  if he did not so frequently contradict himself and advance opinions diametrically opposite to each other Some of Corneille's discourses on his own tragedies are admirably just And one of the best pieces of modern criticism the academy's observations on the Cid was we know the work of persons who had themselves written well And our author's own excellent preface to his translation of the Iliad one of the best pieces of prose in the English language is an example how well poets are qualified to be critics    Some neither can for wits nor critics pass  As heavy mules are neither horse or ass  Those halflearn'd witlings numerous in our isle  As half form'd insects on the banks of Nile  Unfinish'd things one knows not what to call  Their generation's so equivocal  v    These lines and those preceding and following them are excellently satirical and were I think the first we find in his works that give an indication of that species of poetry to  which his talent was most powerfully bent and in which tho' not as we shall see in others he excelled all mankind The simile of the mule heightens the satire

fails  Where beams of bright imagination play  The memory's soft figures melt away  v    I hardly believe there is in any language a metaphor more appositely applied or more elegantly expressed than this of the effects of the warmth of fancy Locke who has embellished his dry subject with a vast variety of pleasing similitudes and allusions has a passage relating to the retentiveness of the memory so very like this before us and so happily worded that I cannot forbear giving the reader the pleasure of comparing them together only premising that these two passages  are patterns of the manner in which the metaphor should be used and of the method of preserving it unmixed with any other idea and not continuing it too far Our minds represent to us those tombs to which we are approaching where though the brass and marble remain yet the inscriptions are effaced by time and the imagery moulders away How much the constitution of our bodies are concerned in this and whether the temper of the brain makes this difference that in some it retains the characters drawn on it like marble in others like freestone and in others little better than sand I shall not here enquire though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body does sometimes influence the memory since we sometimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas and the flames of a fever in a few days CALCINE

experience abundantly evinceth that the three great faculties of the foul here spoken of are seldom found united in the same person There have yet existed but a few transcendant geniuses who have been singularly blest with this rare assemblage of different talents All that I can at present recollect who have at once enjoyed in full vigour a sublime and splendid imagination a solid and profound understanding an exact and tenacious memory are Herodotus Plato Tully Livy Tacitus Galilaeo Bacon Des Cartes Malebranche Milton Burnet of the Charterhouse Berkley and Montesqueiu Bacon in his Novum Organum divides the human genius into two sorts men of dry distinct heads cool imaginations and keen application they easily apprehend the differences of things are masters in controversy and excell in confutation and these are the most common The second sort are men of warm fancies elevated thought and wide knowledge they instantly perceive the resemblances  of things and are poets or makers in science invent arts and strike out new light wherever they  Page  carry their views This general observation has in it all that acuteness comprehension and knowledge of man which so eminently distinguished this philosopher    One science only will one genius fit  So vast is art so narrow human wit  Not only bounded to peculiar arts  But oft in those confin'd to single parts  v    When Tully attempted poetry he became as ridiculous as Bolingbroke when he attempted philosophy and divinity we look in vain for that genius which produced the Dissertation on Parties in the tedious philosophical works of which it is no exaggerated satire to say that the reasoning of them is sophistical and inconclusive the style diffuse and verbose and the learning seemingly contained in them not drawn from the originals but picked up  and purloined from French critics and translations and particularly from Bayle from Rapin and Thomassin as perhaps may be one day minutely shewn together with the assistances that our Cudworth and Stanley happily afforded a writer confessedly ignorant of the Greek tongue who has yet the insufferable  I cannot forbear subjoining a passage of an excellent writer and accomplished scholar which is so very apposite to the present purpose that one would think the author had Bolingbroke in his eye if his valuable work had not been published before

Fontaine whose tales indicated a truly comic genius brought a comedy on the stage it was received with a contempt equally unexpected and undeserved Terence has left us no tragedy and the Mourning Bride of Congreve notwithstanding the praises bestowed on it by POPE in the Dunciad  B v In the notes  is certainly a despicable performance the plot is unnaturally intricate and overcharged with incidents the sentiments trite and the language turgid and bombast Heemskirk and Teniers could not succeed in a serious and sublime subject of historypainting The latter it is well known designed cartoons for tapestry representing the history of the Turriani of Lombardy Both the composition and  the expression are extremely indifferent and some nicer virtuosi have remarked that in the serious pieces into which Hogarth has deviated from the natural biass of his genius there are some strokes of the Ridiculous discernible which suit not with the dignity of his subject In his PREACHING OF St PAUL a dog snarling at a cat and in his PHARAOH's DAUGHTER the figure of the infant Moses who expresses rather archness than timidity are alleged as instances that this artist unrivalled in his own walk could not resist the impulse of his imagination towards drollery His picture however of Richard III is pure and unmixed with any ridiculous circumstances and strongly impresses terror and amazement The modesty and good sense of the ancients is in this particular as in others remarkable The same writer never presumed to undertake more than one kind of dramatic poetry if we except the CYCLOPS of Euripides A poet never presumed to plead in public or to write history or indeed any considerable  work in prose The same actors never recited tragedy and comedy this was observed so long ago as by Plato in the third book of his REPUBLIC They seem to have held that diversity nay universality of excellence at which the moderns frequently aim to be a gift unattainable by man We therefore of GreatBritain have perhaps more reason to congratulate ourselves on two very singular phenomena I mean Shakespear's being able to pourtray characters so very different as FALSTAFF and MACKBETH and Garrick's being able to personate so inimitably a LEAR or an ABEL DRUGGER Nothing can more fully demonstrate the extent and versatility of these two original geniuses Corneille whom the French are so fond of opposing to Shakespear produced very contemptible comedies and the PLAIDEURS of Racine is so close a resemblance of Aristophanes as it ought not to be here urged The most universal of authors seems to be Voltaire who has written almost equally well both in prose and verse and whom either the tragedy of MEROPE  or the history of LOUIS XIV would alone have immortalized    Those rules of old discover'd not devis'd  Are nature still but nature methodiz'd  Nature like liberty is but restrain'd  By the same laws which first herself ordain'd  Ver  THE precepts of the art of poesy were posterior to practise the rules of the Epopea were all drawn from the Iliad and the Odyssey and of Tragedy from the EDIPUS of Sophocles A petulant rejection and an implicit veneration of the rules of the ancient critics are equally destructive of true taste  "It ought to be the first endeavour of a writer says the excellent RAMBLER  N  o    to distinguish nature from custom or that which is established because it is right from that which is right only because it is established that he may neither violate essential principles by a desire of novelty nor debar himself from the attainment of  any beauties within his view by a needless fear of breaking rules where no literary dictator had authority to prescribe"  The same penetrating and judicious author who always thinks for himself has also another passage too full of strong sense and too apposite to the subject before us to be here omitted  "CRITICISM though dignified from the earliest ages by the labours of men eminent for knowledge and sagacity and since the revival of polite literature the favorite study of European scholars has not yet attained the certainty and stability of science The rules that have been hitherto received are seldom drawn from any settled principle or selfevident postulate nor are adapted to the natural and invariable constitution of things but will be found upon examination to be the arbitrary edicts of dictators exalted by their own authority who out of many means by which the same end may be attained selected those which  happened to occur to their own reflection and then by an edict which idleness and timidity were willing to obey prohibited any new experiments of wit restrained fancy from the indulgence of her innate inclination to hazard and adventure and condemned all the future flights of genius to persue the path of the Maeonian eagle"  "THE authority claimed by critics may be more justly opposed as it is apparently derived from them whom they endeavour to controul for we are indebted for a very small part of the rules of writing to the acuteness of those by whom they are delivered The critics have generally no other merit than that of having read the works of great authors with attention they have observed the arrangement of their matter and the graces of their expression and then expect honour and reverence for precepts which they never could have invented so that practice has introduced rules rather than rules have directed practice"  "FOR this reason the laws of every species of writing have been settled by the ideas of him by whom it was first raised to reputation without much enquiry whether his performances were not yet susceptible of improvement The excellencies and the faults of celebrated writers have been equally recommended to posterity and so far has blind reverence prevailed that the NUMBER of their BOOKS has been thought worthy of imitation"  N  o    THIS liberal and manly censure of critical bigotry extends not to those fundamental and indispensable rules which nature and necessity dictate and demand to be observed such for instance in the higher kinds of poetry that the action of the epopea be one great and entire that the hero be eminently distinguished move our concern and deeply interest us that the episodes arise easily out of the main fable that the action commence as near the catastrophe as possible and in the  drama that no more events be crowded together than can be justly supposed to happen during the time of representation or to be transacted on one individual spot and the like But the absurdity here animadverted on is the scrupulous nicety of those who bind themselves to obey frivolous and unimportant laws such as that an epic poem should consist not of less than twelve books that it should end fortunately that in the first book there should be no simile that the exordium should be very simple and unadorned that in a tragedy only three personages should appear at once upon the stage and that a tragedy must consist of five acts by the rigid observation of which last unnecessary precept the poet is deprived of using many a moving story that would furnish matter enough for three perhaps but not for five acts with others of the like nature For the rest as Voltaire observes  Essay sur la poesie Epique pag Tom  whether the action of an epopea be simple or complex completed in a month or in a year or a longer time whether the  scene be fixed to one spot as in the Iliad or that the hero voyages from sea to sea as in the Odyssey whether he be furious like Achilles or pious like Eneas whether the action pass on land or sea on the coast of Africa as in the Luziada of Camoens in America as in the Araucana of Alonzo D'Ercilla in heaven in hell beyond the limits of our world as in the Paradise Lost all these circumstances are of no consequence the poem will be for ever an Epic poem an Heroic poem at least till another new title be found proportioned to its merit If you

flights  Ver  IN the second part of Shaftesbury's ADVICE to an Author is a judicious and elegant account of the rise and progress of arts and sciences in ancient Greece to subjects of which sort it were to be wished this author had always confined himself as he indisputably understood them well rather than that he had blemished and belied his patriotism by writing against the religion of his country I shall give the reader a passage that relates to the origin of criticism which is curious and just  "When the persuasive arts which were necessary to be cultivated among a people that were to be convinced before they acted were grown thus into repute and the power of moving the affections become the study and emulation of the forward wits and aspiring geniuses of the times it would necessarily happen that many geniuses of equal size and strength though less covetous of public applause of power or of influence over mankind would content themselves with the contemplation merely of these enchanting arts These they would the better enjoy the more  they refined their taste and cultivated their earHence was the origin of CRITICS who as arts and sciences advanced would necessarily come withal into repute and being heard with satisfaction in their turn were at length tempted to become authors and appear in public These were honoured with the name of Sophists a character which in early times was highly respected Nor did the gravest philosophers who were censors of manners and critics of a higher degree disdain to exert their criticism on the inferior arts especially in those relating to speech and the power of argument and persuasion When such a race as this was once risen 'twas no longer possible to impose on mankind by what was specious and pretending The public would be paid in no false wit or jingling eloquence Where the learned critics were so well received and philosophers themselves disdained not to be of the number there could not fail to arise critics of an inferior order who would subdivide the several provinces of this empire"  Characteristics vol I mo pag    Know well each Ancient's proper character  His fable subject scope in every page  Religion country genius of his age  Ver  FROM their inattention to these particulars many critics and particularly the French have been guilty of great absurdities When Perrault impotently attempted to ridicule the first stanza of the first Olympic of Pindar he was ignorant that the poet in beginning with the praises of WATER  alluded to the philosophy of Thales who taught that water was the principle of all things and which philosophy Empedocles the Sicilian a cotemporary of Pindar and a subject of Hiero to whom Pindar wrote had adopted in his beautiful poem Homer and the Greek tragedians have been likewise censured the former for protracting the Iliad after the death of Hector and the latter for continuing the AJAX and PHOENISSAE after the deaths of their respective heroes But the censurers did not consider the importance of burial among  the ancients and that the action of the Iliad would have been imperfect without a description of the funeral rites for Hector and Patroclus as the two tragedies without those of Polynices and Eteocles for the ancients esteemed a deprivation of sepulture to be a more severe calamity than death itself It is observable that this circumstance did not occur to POPE  Iliad Note I  when he endeavoured to justify this conduct of Homer by only saying that as the anger of Achilles does not die with Hector but persecutes his very remains the poet still keeps up to his subject by describing the many effects of that anger 'till it is fully satisfied and that for this reason the two last books of the Iliad may be thought not to be excrescencies but essential to the poem I will only add that I do not know an author whose capital excellence suffers more from the reader's not regarding his climate and country than the incomparable Cervantes There is a striking propriety in the madness of Don Quixote not frequently  taken notice of for Thuanus informs us that MADNESS is a common disorder among the Spaniards at the latter part of life about the age of which the knight is represented  "Sur la fin de ses jours Mendozza devint furieux comme font d'ordinaire les Espagnols"  Perroniana Thuana a Cologne pag    Still

of criticism as have been spent upon them yet the following remarks have a novelty and penetration in them that may entertain especially as the treatise from which they are taken is extremely scarce  "Quae variae inter se notae atque imagines animorum a principibus utriusque populi poetis Homero Virgilio mirificè exprimuntur Siquidem Homeri duces reges rapacitate libidine atque  anilibus questibus

in his twelfth Section    Some beauties yet no precepts can declare  For there's a happiness as well as care  Music resembles poetry in each  Are nameless graces which no methods teach  And which a masterhand alone can reach  Ver  POPE in this passage seems to have remembered one of the Essays of Bacon of which he is known to have been remarkably fond  "There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion A man cannot tell whether Apelles or Albert Durer were the more trifler whereof the one would make a personage by geometrical  proportions the other by taking the best parts out of divers faces to make one excellent Such personages I think would please nobody but the painter that made them Not but I think a painter may make a better face than ever was but he must do it by a kind of felicity as a musician that maketh an excellent ayre in music and not by rule A man shall see faces that if you examine them part by part you shall find never a good one and yet altogether doe well"  Essay xliii On BEAUTY    Thus Pegasus a nearer way to take  May boldly deviate from the common track  From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part  And snatch a grace beyond

monstrous and mishap'd appear  Consider'd singly or beheld too near  Which but proportion'd to their light or place  Due distance reconciles to time and place  Ver  BY this excellent observation delivered in a beautiful metaphor all the faults imputed to Homer may be justified Those who censure what is called the GROSSNESS of some of his images may please to attend to the following remark of a writer by no means prejudiced in favour of the ancients  "Quant a ce qu'on appelle GROSSIERETE dans les héros d'Homére on peut rire tant qu'on voudra de voir Patrocle au neuviéme livre de l'Iliade

judge has lately made the following observation  "I do not mean to affirm that in this extensive work of Marcello every recitative air or chorus is of equal excellence A continued elevation of this kind no author ever came up to Nay if we consider that variety which in all arts is necessary to keep up attention we may perhaps affirm with truth that INEQUALITY makes a part of the character of excellence that something ought to be thrown into shades in order to make the lights more  striking And in this respect Marcello is truly excellent if ever he seems to FALL it is only to RISE with more astonishing majesty and greatness"  Avison's Essay on Musical Expression edit ii pag  It may be pertinent to subjoin Roscommon's remark on the same subject  Far the greatest part  Of what some

instance of the strength of fancy The images however appear too general and indistinct and the last line conveys no new idea to the mind The following picture in Shaftesbury on the same sort of subject appears to be more full and striking  "Beneath the mountain's foot the rocky country rises into hills a proper basis of the ponderous mass above where huge embodied rocks lie piled on one another and seem to prop the high arch of heaven See with what trembling steps poor mankind tread the narrow brink of the deep precipices From whence with giddy horror they look down mistrusting even

taken from the second part of Don Quixote first written by Don Alonzo Fernandez de Avellanada and afterwards translated or rather imitated and newmodelled by no less an author than the celebrated Le Sage  Le Sage generally took his plans from the Spanish writers the manners of which nation he has well imitated Le Diable Boiteux was drawn from the Diabolo Cojuelo of Guevara his Gil Blas from Don Gusman D'Alfarache Le Sage made a journey into Spain to acquaint himself with the Spanish customs He is a natural writer of true humour He died in a little house near Paris where he supported himself by writing  The book is not so contemptible as some authors insinuate it was well received in France and abounds in many  of humour and character worthy Cervantes himself The brevity to which POPE's narration was confined would not permit him to insert the following humorous dialogue at length  "I am satisfied you'll compass your design said the other scholar provided you omit the combat in the lists Let him have a care of that said Don Quixote interrupting him that is the best part of the plot But Sir quoth the Batchelor if you would have me adhere to Aristotle's rules I must omit the combat Aristotle replied the Knight I grant was a man of some parts but his capacity was not unbounded and give me leave to tell you his authority does not extend over combats in the list which are far above his narrow rules Would you suffer the chaste Queen of Bohemia to perish For how can you clear her innocence Believe me COMBAT is the most honourable method you can pursue and besides it will add such grace to your play that all the rules in the universe must not stand in competition with it Well Sir Knight replied the Batchelor for your sake and for  the honour of chivalry I will not leave out the combat and that it may appear the more glorious all the court of Bohemia shall be present at it from the princes of the blood to the very footmen But still one difficulty remains which is that our common theatres are not large enough for it There must be one erected on purpose answered the Knight and in a word rather than leave out the combat the play had better be acted in a field

natural obvious and drawn from his situation  Idyll    These simple and pastoral images were the most proper that could occur to a Cyclops and to an inhabitant of Sicily Ovid could not restrain the luxuriancy of his genius on the same occasion from wandering into an endless variety of flowery and unappropriated similitudes and equally applicable to any other person or place  Candidior nivei

observations on Waller has given us a curious anecdote concerning the great industry and exactness with which Waller published even his smallest compositions  "When the court was at Windsor these verses  Only ten in number  were writ in Tasso of her Royal Highness at Mr Waller's request by the late Duke of Buckinghamshire and I very well remember to have heard his Grace say that the author employed the GREATEST PART OF A SUMMER in composing and correcting them So that however he is generally reputed the parent of those swarms of insectwits who affect to be thought easy writers it is

famous with repeated alterations and many rasures Moliere is reported to have past whole days in fixing upon a proper epithet or rhyme although his verses have all the flow and freedom of conversation This happy facility said a man of wit may be compared to gardenterraces the expence of which does not appear and which after the cost of several millions yet seem to be a mere work of chance and nature I have been informed that Addison was so extremely nice in polishing his prose compositions that when almost a whole impression of a Spectator was worked off he would stop the press to insert a new preposition or conjunction    Soft is the stream when Zephyr gently blows  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows  But when loud surges lash the sounding shore  The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar  When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw  The line too labours and the words move slow  Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain  Flies o'er th'unbending corn and skims along the main  Ver  THESE lines are usually cited as fine examples of adapting the sound to the sense But that POPE has failed in this endeavour has been lately demonstrated by the RAMBLER  "The verse intended to represent the  whisper  of the  vernal breeze  must surely be confessed not much to excell in softness or volubility and the  smooth stream  runs with a perpetual clash of jarring consonants The noise and turbulence of the  torrent  is indeed distinctly imaged for it requires very little skill to make our language rough But in the lines which mention the  effort of Ajax  there is no particular heaviness or delay The  swiftness of Camilla  is rather contrasted than exemplified Why the verse should be  lengthened to express speed will not easily de discovered In the dactyls used for that purpose by the ancients two short syllables were pronounced with such rapidity as to be equal only to one long they therefore naturally exhibit the act of passing through a long space in a short time But the  Alexandrine  by its pause in the midst is a tardy and stately measure and the word  unbending  one of the most sluggish and slow which our language affords cannot much accelerate its motion"  N  o      Be thou the first true merit to befriend  His praise is lost who stays 'till all commend  Ver  WHEN Thomson published his WINTER it lay a long time neglected 'till Mr Spense made honourable mention of it in his Essay on the Odyssey which becoming a popular book made the poem universally known Thomson always acknowledged the use of this early recommendation and from this circumstance an intimacy commenced between the  critic and the poet which lasted 'till the lamented death of the latter who was of a most amiable benevolent temper    And such as Chaucer is shall Dryden be  Ver  WALLER has an elegant copy of verses on the mutability of the English tongue which bears a strong resemblance to this passage of POPE  Poets that lasting marble seek  Must carve in Latin or in Greek  We write in sand our language grows  And like the tide our work o'erflows  Chaucer his SENSE can only boast  The glory of his numbers lost  Years have defac'd his matchless strain  And yet HE DID NOT SING IN VAIN  Of ENGLISH VERSE Fenton's edit pag mo  TO fix a language has been found among the most able undertakers to be a fruitless project The style of the present French Novels and Memoirs for the French at present produce little besides is visibly different  from that of Boileau and Bossuet notwithstanding the strict and seasonable injunctions of the Academy and the diction even of such a writer as Maffei is corrupted with many words not to be found in Machiavel or Ariosto    So when the faithful pencil has design'd  Some bright idea of the master's mind  When a new world leaps out at his command  And ready nature waits upon his hand  When the ripe colours soften and unite  And sweetly melt into just shade and light  Where mellowing years their full perfection give  And each bold figure just begins to live  The treacherous colours the fair art betray  And all the bright creation fades away  Ver  I HAVE quoted these beautiful lines at lenth as I believe nothing was ever so happily expressed on the art of painting a subject of which POPE always speaks  con amore  Of all poets whatever Milton has spoken most feelingly of music and POPE of painting  The reader may however compare the following passage of Dryden on the same subject  More cannot be by mortal art express'd  But venerable age shall add the rest  For Time shall with his ready pencil stand  Retouch your figures with his ripening hand  Mellow your colours and imbrown the tint  Add ev'ry grace which Time alone can grant  To future ages shall your same convey  And give more beauties than he takes away  Dryden to Kneller  IF POPE has so much excelled in speaking in the properest terms of this art it may perhaps be ascribed to his having practised it the same may be said of Milton with respect to music It may perhaps be wondered at that a proficiency in these arts is not now frequently found in the same person I cannot at present recollect any painters that were good poets except Salvator Rosa and Charles Vermander of Mulbrac in Flanders whose comedies are much esteemed But the satires of the former contain no strokes of that fervid and wild imagination so visible in his landschapes    If wit so much from ign'rance undergo  Ver  THE inconveniencies that attend wit are well enumerated in this excellent passage Poets who imagine they are known and admired are frequently mortified and humbled Boileau going one day to receive his pension and the treasurer reading these words in his Order  "The pension we have granted to Boileau on account of the satisfaction  his works  have given us"  asked him of what kind were  his works  "Of  Masonry  replied the poet I am a BUILDER"  Racine always reckoned the praises of the ignorant among the chief sources of chagrin and used to relate that an old magistrate who had never been at a play was carried one day to his Andromaque This magistrate was very attentive to the tragedy to which was added the Plaideurs and going out of the theatre he said to the author  "I am extremely pleased Sir with your Andromaque I am only amazed that it ends so  gaily  J'avois d'abord en quelque envie de pleurer mais la vue des petits chiens m'a fait rire"    Now they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown  Employ their pains to spurn some others down  Ver  THE arts used by Addison to suppress the rising merit of POPE which are now fully laid open give one pain to behold to what mean artifices envy and malignity will compel a gentleman and a genius to descend It is certain that Addison discouraged POPE from inserting the machinery in the Rape of the Lock that he privately insinuated that POPE was a Tory and a Jacobite and had a hand in writing the Examiners that Addison himself translated the first book of Homer published under Tickel's name and that he secretly encouraged Gildon to abuse POPE in a virulent pamphlet for which Addison paid Gildon ten guineas This usage extorted from POPE the famous character of Atticus  which is perhaps the finest piece of satire extant It is said that when Racine read his tragedy of Alexander to Corneille the latter gave him many general commendations but advised him to apply his genius as not being adapted to the drama to some other species of poetry Corneille one would hope was incapable of a mean jealousy and if he gave this advice thought it really proper to be given    When love was all an easy monarch's care  Seldom at council never in a war  Ver  THE dissolute reign of Charles II justly deserved the satirical proscription in this passage Under the notion of laughing at the absurd austerities of the Puritans it became the mode to run into the contrary extreme and to ridicule real religion and unaffected virtue The King during his exile had seen and admired the splendor of the court of Louis XIV and endeavoured to introduce the same luxury into the English court The  common opinion that this was the Augustan age in England is excessively false A just taste was by no means yet formed What was called SHEER WIT was alone studied and applauded Rochester it is said had no idea that there could be a better poet than Cowley The King was perpetually quoting HUDIBRAS The neglect of such a poem as the Paradise Lost will for ever remain a monument of the bad taste that prevailed It may be added that the progress of philological learning and of what is called the belle lettres was perhaps obstructed by the institution of the Royal Society which turned the thoughts of men of genius to physical enquiries Our style in prose was but beginning to be polished although the diction of Hobbes is sufficiently pure which philosopher and not the FLORID Spratt was the classic of that age If I was to name a time when the arts and polite literature were at their height in this nation I should mention the latter end of King William and the reign of Queen Anne    With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust  Nor be so civil as to prove unjust  Ver  OUR poet practised this excellent precept in his conduct towards Wycherley whose pieces he corrected with equal freedom and judgment But Wycherley who had a bad heart and an insufferable share of vanity and who was one of the professed WITS of the lastmentioned age was soon disgusted at this candour and ingenuity of POPE insomuch that he came to an open and ungenerous rupture with him    Fear not the anger of the wise to raise  Those best can bear reproof who merit praise  Ver  THE freedom and unreservedness with which Boileau and Racine communicated their works to each other is hardly to be parallelled of which many amiable instances appear in their letters lately published by the son of the latter particularly in the following  "J'ai trouve que la TROMPETTE  LES SOURDS etoient trop joues qu'il ne falloit point trop appuyer sur votre incommodite moins encore chercher de l'esprit sur ce sujet"  Pag See also pag  Boileau communicated to his friend the first sketch of his ode on the Taking Namur It is entertaining to contemplate a rude draught by such a master and is no less pleasing to observe the temper with which he receives the objections of Racine  Pag  "J'ai deja retouche a tout cela mais je ne veux point l'achever que ja n'aie reçû vos remarques qui surement m'eclaireront encore l'esprit"  The same volume informs us of a curious anecdote that Boileau generally made the second verse of a couplet before the first that he declared it was one of the grand secrets of poetry to give by this means a greater energy and meaning to his verses that he advised Racine to follow the same method and said on this occasion  "I have taught him to rhyme  difficilement  "    No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd  Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's churchyard  Nay fly to altars there they'll talk you dead  For fools rush in where angels fear to tread  Ver  THIS stroke of satire is literally taken from Boileau  Gardezvous d'imiter ce rimeur furieux  Qui de ses vains ecrits lecteur harmonieux  Aborde en recitant quiconque le salüe  Et poursuit de ses vers les passans dans la rüe  Il n'est Temple si saint des Anges respecte  Qui soit contre sa muse un lieu du surete  Art Poet Chant iv  Which lines allude to the impertinence of a French poet called Du Perrier who finding Boileau one day at church insisted upon repeating to him an ode during the elevation of the host and desired his opinion whether or no it was in the manner of Malherbe Without this anecdote the pleasantry of the satire would be overlooked It may here be occasionally observed how many beauties in this species of writing are lost for want of  knowing the facts to which they allude The following passage may be produced as a proof Boileau in his excellent Epistle to his Gardener at Anteuil says  Mon maitre diroistu passe pour un Docteur  Et parle quelquefois mieux qu'un Predicateur  Epitre  IT seems our  The names of Corneille and Racine being often mentioned in this work it will not be improper to add an ingenious Parallel of their respective merits written by Fontenelle  I Corneille had no excellent author before his eyes whom he could follow Racine had Corneille  II Corneille found the French stage in a barbarous state and advanced it to great perfection Racine has not supported it in the perfection in which he found it  III The characters of Corneille are true though they are not common The characters of Racine are not true but only so far forth as they are common  IV Sometimes the characters of Corneille are in some respects false and unnatural in that they are noble and singular Those of Racine are often in some respects low on account of their being natural and ordinary  V He that has a noble heart would chuse to resemble the heroes of Corneille He that has a little heart is pleased to find his own resemblance in the heroes of Racine  VI We carry from hearing the pieces of the One a desire to be virtuous And we carry the pleasure of finding men like ourselves in foibles and weaknesses from the pieces of the Other  VII The Tender and the Graceful of Racine is sometimes to be found in Corneille The Grand and Sublime of Corneille is never to be found in Racine  VIII Racine has painted only the French and the present age even when he designed to paint another age and other nations We see in Corneille all those ages and all those nations that he intended to paint  IX The number of the pieces of Corneille is much greater than that of Racine Corneille notwithstanding has made fewer tautologies and repetitions than Racine has made  X In the passages where the versification of Corneille is good it is more bold more noble and at the same time as pure and as finished as that of Racine but it is not preserved in this degree of beauty and that of Racine is always equally supported  XI Authors inferior to Racine have written successfully after him in his own way No author not even Racine himself dared to attempt after Corneille that kind of writing which was peculiar to him  This comparison of the justness of which the reader is left to judge is said greatly to have irritated Boileau the invariable friend and defender of Racine It may be remarked that Boileau had mentioned Fontenelle with contempt in a stanza that originally concluded his Ode to the King at present omitted These were the lines  J'aime mieux nouvel Jcare  Dans les airs cherchant Pindare  Tomber du ciel le plus haut  Que louè de Fontenelle  Razer craintive Hirondelle  La terre comme Perault  This ode was parodied in France but not with such incomparable humour as by our Prior in England  To these remarks of Fontenelle may be added what Voltaire says with his usual vivacity and brevity  "Corneille alone formed himself but Louis XIV Colbert Sophocles and Euripides all of them contributed to form Racine"  author and Racine returned one day in high spirits from Versailles with two honest citizens of Paris As their conversation  was full of gaiety and humour the two citizens were vastly delighted and one of them at parting stopt Boileau with this compliment  "I have travelled with Doctors of the Sorbonne and even with Religious but I never heard so many fine things said before  en verite vous parlez cent fois mieux qu'un  PREDICATEUR"  IT is but justice to add that the fourteen succeeding verses in the poem before us containing the character of a TRUE CRITIC are superior to any thing in Boileau's Art of Poetry from which however POPE has borrowed many observations    The mighty STAGYRITE first left the shore  Spread all his sails and durst the deep explore  He steer'd securely and discover'd far  Led by the light of the Maeonian star  Ver  A NOBLE and just character of the first and the best of critics And sufficient to repress the fashionable and nauseous petulance of several impertinent moderns who have attempted to discredit this great and useful writer Whoever surveys the variety and perfection of his productions all delivered in the chastest style in the clearest order and the most pregnant brevity is amazed at the immensity of his genius His logic however at present neglected for those redundant and verbose systems which took their rise from Locke's Essay on the Human Understanding is a mighty effort of the mind in which are discovered the principal sources of the art of reasoning and the dependencies of one thought on another and where by the different combinations he hath made of all the forms  the understanding can assume in reasoning which he hath traced for it he hath so closely confined it that it cannot depart from them without arguing inconsequentially His Physics contain many useful observations particularly his History of Animals to assist him in which Alexander gave orders that creatures of different climates and countries should at a great expence be brought to him to pass under his inspection His Morals are perhaps the purest system in antiquity His Politics are a most valuable monument of the civil wisdom of the ancients as they preserve to us the description of several governments and particularly of Crete and Carthage that otherwise would have been unknown But of all his compositions his Rhetoric and Poetics are most complete No writer has shewn a greater penetration into recesses of the human heart than this philosopher in the second book of his Rhetoric where he treats of the different manners and passions that distinguish each different age and condition of man and from whence Horace  plainly took his famous description in the Art of Poetry  Ver  La Bruyere Rochefoucault and Montaigne himself are not to be compared to him in this respect No succeeding writer on eloquence not even Tully has added any thing new or important on this subject His Poetics which I suppose are here by POPE chiefly referred to seem to have been written for the use of that prince with whose education Aristotle was honoured to give him a just taste in reading Homer and the tragedians to judge properly of which was then thought no unnecessary accomplishment in the character of a prince To attempt to understand poetry without having diligently digested this treatise would be as absurd and impossible as to pretend to a skill in geometry without having studied Euclid The fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth chapters wherein he has pointed out the properest methods of exciting TERROR and PITY convince us that he was intimately acquainted with those objects which most forcibly affect the  heart The prime excellence of this precious treatise is the scholastic precision and philosophical closeness with which the subject is handled without any address to the passions or imagination It is to be lamented that the part of the Poetics in which he had given precepts for comedy did not likewise descend to posterity    HORACE still charms with graceful negligence  And without method talks us into sense  Ver  THE vulgar notion that Horace wrote his Epistle to the Pisos without method has been lately confuted as we hinted before  Pag    It is equally false that that epistle contains a complete Art of Poetry it being solely confined to the state and defects of the Roman drama The transitions in the writings of Horace are some of the most exquisite strokes of his art many of them pass at present unobserved and that his cotemporaries were equally blind to this beauty he himself complains though with a seeming irony  Cum lamentamur non APPARERE labores  Nostros et TENUI deducta poemata filo  Epist I ver lib  It seems also to be another common mistake that one of Horace's characteristics is the SUBLIME of which indeed he has given a very few strokes and those taken from Pindar and probably from Alcaeus His excellence lay in exquisite observations on human life and in touching the foibles of mankind with delicacy and urbanity 'Tis easy to perceive this moral turn in all his compositions the writer of the epistles is discerned in the odes Elegance not sublimity was his grand characteristic Horace is the most popular author of all antiquity the reason is because he abounds in images drawn from familiar life and in remarks that  "come home to mens business and bosoms"  Hence he is more frequently quoted and alluded to than any poet of a higher cast    See DIONYSIUS Homer's thoughts refine  And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line  Ver  THESE prosaic lines this spiritless elogy are much below the merit of the critic whom they are intended to celebrate POPE seems here rather to have considered Dionysius as the author only of his little Treatise concerning Homer and to have in some measure overlooked or at least not to have sufficiently insisted on his most excellent book ΠΕΡΙ ΣΥΝΘΗΣΕΩΣ ΟΝΟΜΑΤΩΝ in which he has unfolded all the secret arts that render composition harmonious One part of this discourse I mean from the beginning of the twentyfirst to the end of the twentyfourth Section is perhaps one of the most useful pieces of criticism extant He there discusses the three different species of composition which he divides into the NERVOUS and AUSTERE the SMOOTH and FLORID and the MIDDLE which partakes of the nature of the two others As examples of the first species he mentions Antimachus and Empedocles in heroics Pindar in lyric Aeschylus in tragic poetry and Thucydides in history As examples of the second he produces Hesiod  as a writer in heroics Sappho Anacreon and Simonides in lyric Euripides ONLY among tragic writers among the historians Ephorus and Theopompus and Isocrates among the rhetoricians all these says he have used words that are ΛΕΙΑ χαι ΜΑΛΑΚΑ χαι ΠΑΡΘΕΝΩΠΑ The writers which he alleges as instances of the third species who have happily blended the two other species of composition and who are the most complete models of style are Homer in epic poetry Stesichorus and Alcaeus in lyric in tragic Sophocles in history Herodotus in eloquence Demosthenes in philosophy Democritus Plato and Aristotle    Fancy and art in gay PETRONIUS please  The scholar's learning with the courtier's ease  Ver  FOR what merit Petronius should be placed among useful critics I could never discern There are not above two or three pages containing critical remarks in his work the chief merit of which is that of telling a story  with grace and ease His own style is more affected than even that of his cotemporaries when the Augustan simplicity was laid aside Many of his metaphors are farfetched and mixed of which this glaring instance may be alleged  "Neque concipere aut edere partum mens potest nisi ingenti flumine literarum inundata"  Pag Ed Amstael  where animal conception and delivery are confounded with vegetable production His character of Horace however celebrated  "Horatii  curiosa faelicitas  "  is surely a very unclassical inversion for he ought to have called it the  happy carefulness  of Horace rather than his  careful happiness  I shall observe by the way that the copy of this author found some years ago bears many signatures of its spuriousness and particularly of its being forged by a Frenchman For we have this expression  "ad CASTELLA sese receperunt"  that is  "to their CHATEAUX"  instead of  "ad  Villas  "    In grave QUINTILIAN's copious work we find  The justest rules and clearest method join'd  TO commend Quintilian barely for his method and to insist merely on this excellence is below the merit of one of the most rational and elegant of Roman writers Considering the nature of Quintilian's subject he afforded copious matter for a more appropriated and poetical character No author ever adorned a scientifical treatise with so many beautiful metaphors Quintilian was found in the bottom of a tower of the monastery of St Gal by Poggius as appears by one of his letters dated written from Constance when the council was then sitting The monastery was about twenty miles from that city Silius Italicus was found at the same time and place    Thee bold LONGINUS all the Nine inspire  And bless their critic with a poet's fire  Ver  THIS abrupt address to Longinus is more spirited and striking and more suitable to the character of the person addressed than if he had coldly spoken of him in the third person  The taste and sensibility of Longinus were exquisite but his observations are too general and his method too loose The precision of the true philosophical critic is lost in the declamation of the florid rhetorician Instead of shewing for what reason a sentiment or image is SUBLIME and discovering the secret power by which they affect a reader with pleasure he is ever intent on producing something SUBLIME  himself  and strokes of his  own  eloquence Instead of pointing out the foundation of the grandeur of Homer's imagery where he describes the motion of Neptune the critic is endeavouring to rival the poet by saying that  "there was not room enough in the whole earth to take such another step"  He should have shewn why the speech of Phaeton to his son in a fragment of Euripides was so lively and picturesque instead of which he ardently exclaims  "would not you say that the soul of the writer ascended the chariot with the driver and waS whirled along in the same flight and danger with the rapid horses"  We have lately  seen a just specimen of the genuine method of criticising in Mr Harris's accurate Discourse on Poetry Painting and Music I have frequently wondered that Longinus who mentions Tully should have taken no notice of Virgil I suppose he thought him only a servile copier of the Greeks    From the same foes at last both felt their doom  And the same age saw learning fall and Rome  Ver  "'TWAS the fate of Rome to have scarce an intermediate age or single period of time between the rise of arts and fall of liberty No sooner had that nation begun to lose the roughness and barbarity of their manners and learn of Greece to form their heroes their orators and poets on a right model than by their unjust attempt upon the liberty of the world they justly lost their own With their liberty they lost not only their force of eloquence but even their style and language itself The poets who afterwards  arose among them were mere unnatural and forced plants Their TWO most finished who came last and closed the scene were plainly such as had seen the days of liberty ann felt the sad effects of its departure"  ADVICE to an Auth Vol i Edit mo  SHAFTESBURY proceeds to observe that when despotism was fully established not a statue picture or medal not a tolerable piece of architecture afterwards appearedAnd it was I may add the opinion of Longinus and Addison who adopted it from him that arbitrary governments were pernicious to the fine arts as well as to the sciences Modern history however has afforded an example to the contrary Painting sculpture and music have been seen to arrive to a high perfection in Rome notwithstanding the slavery and superstition that reign there nay superstition itself has been highly productive of these fine arts for with what

Pag  that he had some design of writing his life in latin I call Erasmus a wonderful man not only on account of the variety and classical purity of his works but of that penetration that strong and acute sense which enabled him to pierce through the absurdities of the times and expose them with such poignant ridicule and attic elegance A work of humour and of humour directed to expose the priests in that age was indeed a prodigy The irony of the Encomium on Folly has never been excelled Erasmus though a commentator had taste and though a catholic had charity His learning was enlivened with wit and his orthodoxy was tempered with moderation He was never dazzled with what was called ERUDITION or misled by that blind and undistinguishing veneration which was naturally paid to the antients on the first discovery of their writings By his CICERONIANUS he repressed the affectation of imitating Tully's manner of expression in  every species of composition In his ECCLESIASTES very excellent rules are laid down for preaching In his DIALOGUES the superstitions of the Romish church are exposed with all the pleasantry of Lucian an author to whom his genius bore great resemblance and some of whose dialogues he has translated with their original spirit Indeed among the many translators of Greek authors who flourished at that time Erasmus seems to have been in all respects the most eminent To him was the restoration of literature principally owing More than one prince sollicited his friendship and invited him to their courts We see in a letter of Erasmus written in the year that Francis I who shared with Leo X the glory of reviving sciences and arts in Europe having declared to Petit his confessor that he intended to bring into France the most learned men he could find Petit had charged Budaeus and Cop the royal physician to write to Erasmus to engage him to settle in France that Stephen Poncher embassador from the king at Brussels pressed  him still more but that

it's productions in literature and the fine arts have arrived at a perfection not equalled in other periods The FIRST is the age of Philip and Alexander about which time flourished Socrates Plato Demosthenes Aristotle Lysippus Apelles Phidias Praxiteles Thucydides Xenophon Aeschylus Euripides Sophocles Aristophanes Menander  Philemon The SECOND age which has never yet been sufficiently taken notice of was that of Ptolomy Philadelphus king of Aegypt in which appeared Lycophron Aratus Nicander Apollonius Rhodius Theocritus Callimachus Eratosthenes Philichus Erisistratus the physician Timaeus the historian Cleanthes Diogenes the painter and Sostrates the architect This prince from his love of learning commanded the Old Testament to be translated into Greek The THIRD age is that of Julius Caesar and Augustus marked with the illustrious names of Laberius Catullus Lucretius Cicero Livy Varro Virgil Horace Propertius Tibullus Ovid Phaedrus Vitruvius Dioscorides The FOURTH age was that of Julius II and Leo X which produced Ariosto Tasso Fracastorius Sannazarius Vida Bembo Sadolet Machiavel Guiccardin Michael Angelo Raphael Titian The FIFTH age is that of Louis XIV in France and of king William and queen Anne in England in which or thereabouts are to be found Corneille Moliere Racine Boileau  Fontaine Bossuet Rochefoucault Paschal Bourdaloüe Patru Malbranche De Retz Bruyere

Atterbury Boyle Locke Newton Clarke Kneller Thornill Jervas Dahl Purcell Mead Friend  CONCERNING the particular encouragement given by Leo X to polite literature and the fine arts I forbear to enlarge because a friend of mine is at present engaged in writing THE HISTORY OF THE AGE OF LEO X It is a noble period and full of those most important events which have had the greatest influence on human affairs Such as the discovery of the WestIndies by the Spaniards and of a passage to the East by the Portugueze the invention of printing the reformation of reliligion with many others all which will be  insisted upon at large and their consequences displayed I shall only here transiently observe that some efforts to emerge from barbarity had long before this time appeared in Italy Dante wrote his sublime  See particularly the beginning of the third Canto of the INFERNO as also the beginning of the sixth  and original poem which is a kind of satirical epic and which abounds in images and sentiments equal to the best of Homer but whose works he had never seen about the year Giotto the disciple of Cimabue the friend of Dante and subject of his praises was employed about the same time by Benedict XI and a picture of mosaic work done by him over the gate of St Peter's church at Rome is still remaining A Tuscan called Guy of Arezzo invented the musical notes in use at present and Bruneleschi built palaces at Florence in the style of ancient architecture Soon afterwards Boccace and Petrarch polished and fixed the standard of the Italian language  "Veggiamo in un medesimo progresso di tempo dal regno principalmente dell'una e dell'altra Sicilia e poi dalla Lombardia e de vari e distinti luoghi d'Italia sorgere scrittori i quali anno favella con Dante Petrarcha Boccacio

Guido Guislieri Jacopo della Lana Giotto Mantovano"  Gravina della Rag Poet lib ii pag  To Petrarch the honour  is generally attributed of having restored the elegance of the Latin tongue particularly in poetry But a late acute searcher into antiquity whose death is justly lamented the learned Scipio Maffei has informed us  TEATRO Italiano In Verona tom i pag  in a curious passage that this was not so much owing to Petrarch as to Albertino Mussato a native of Padua with whose merit the learned seem not to be sufficiently acquainted Mussato died very old after having borne the greatest offices in his country in the year that is to say thirtyfive years before Petrarch He wrote not only many books of a history of his own times but also an heroic poem on the siege of Padua by the  Veronese under the great Can together with eclogues elegies epistles in verse and an Ovidian Cento However to form a full judgment in this case one need only peruse his two latin tragedies entitled ECCERINIS and ACHILLES which he composed in the style and manner of Seneca and which were the first regular and perfect dramas that are to be found since the barbarous and obscure ages    Immortal VIDA on whose honour'd brow  The Poet's bays and Critic's ivy grow  Ver  THE merits of Vida seem not to have been particularly attended to in England 'till POPE had bestowed this commendation upon him although the Poetics had been correctly published at Oxford by Basil Kennet some time before The SILKWORMS of Vida are written with classical purity and with a just mixture of the styles of Lucretius and Virgil It was a happy choice to write a poem on  CHESS  Qu'est ce qu'un grand capitaine Un homme admiré de beaucoup inferieur a un grand JOUEUR D'ECHECHS qui ne l'est pas  MES PENSEES CCXLII  nor is the execution less happy The various stratagems and manifold intricacies of this ingenious game so difficult to be described in latin are here expressed with the greatest perspicuity and elegance so that perhaps the game might be learnt from this description Amidst many prosaic flatnesses there are many fine strokes in the CHRISTIAD particularly his angels with respect to their persons and insignia are drawn with that dignity which we so much admire in Milton who seems to have had his eye on those passages  Della Ragion Poet pag  Gravina applauds Vida for having found out a method to introduce the whole history of our Saviour's life by putting it into the mouth of St Joseph and St John who relate it to Pilate But surely this speech consisting of as many lines as that of Dido to Aeneas was too long to be made on such an occasion when Christ was brought before  the tribunal of Pilate to be judged and condemned to death The Poetics are perhaps the most perfect of his compositions they are excellently translated by Pitt Vida had formed himself upon Virgil who is therefore his hero he has too much depreciated Homer Although his precepts principally regard epic poetry yet many of them are applicable to every species of composition  Victorius's latin translation of Aristotle's poetics was published at Florence Castlevetro's Italian one at Vienna  This poem has the praise of being one of the first if not the very first pieces of criticism that appeared in Italy since the revival of learning for it was finished as is evident from a short advertisement prefixed to it in the year MDXX It is remarkable that most of the great poets about this time wrote an Art of Poetry Trissino a name respected for giving to Europe the first regular epic poem and for first daring to throw off the bondage of rhyme published at Vicenza in the year MDXXIX DELLA POETICA  divisioni quattro  several  years before his Italia Liberata We have of Fracastorius NAUGERIUS  sive de Poetica dialogus  Venetiis MDLV Minturnus DE POETA  libri sex  appeared at Venice MDLIX Bernardo Tasso the father of Torquato and author of an epic poem entitled L'Amadigi wrote RAGIONAMENTO  della Poesia  printed at Venice MDLXII And to pay the highest honour to criticism the great Torquato Tasso himself wrote DISCORSI  del Poema Eroico  printed at Venice MDLXXXVII These discourses are full of learning and taste But I must not omit a curious anecdote which  Tom i pag  Menage has given us in his AntiBaillet namely that Sperone claimed these discourses as his own for he thus speaks of them in one of his letters to Felice Paciotto  "Laudo voi infinitamente di voler scrivere della poetica della quale interrogato molte fiate dal Tasso  It may be remarked as an instance of Tasso's JUDGMENT that he himself did not approve the episode of Sophronia and Olindo so commonly censured  e rispondendogli io liberamente si come soglio  egli n'a fatto un volume e mandato al Signior Scipio Gonzaga per cosa sua e non mia ma io ne chiarirò il mondo"    And BOILEAU still in right of Horace sways  Ver  MAY I be pardoned for declaring it as my opinion that Boileau's is the best  It was translated into Portugueze verse by Count d'Ericeyra  Art of Poetry extant The brevity of his precepts enlivened by proper imagery the justness of his metaphors the harmony of his numbers as far as alexandrine lines will admit the exactness of his method the perspicacity of his remarks and the energy of his style all duly considered may render this opinion not unreasonable It is scarcely to be conceived how much is comprehended in four short cantos  It is remarkable Boileau declared he had never read Vida  He that has well digested these cannot be said to be ignorant of any important rule of poetry The tale of the physician turning architect in the fourth canto is told with vast pleasantry It is to this work Boileau  owes his immortality which was of the highest utility to his nation in diffusing a just way of thinking and writing banishing every species of false wit and introducing a general taste for the manly simplicity of the ancients on whose writings this poet had formed his taste Boileau's chief talent was the DIDACTIC His fancy was not the predominant faculty of his mind Fontenelle has thus characterised him  "Il etoit grand et excellent versificateur pourvû cependant que cette louange se renferme dans ses beaux jours dont la difference avec les autres est bien marquée et faisoit souvent dire  Helas  et  Hola  mais il n'etoit pas grand poete si l'entend par ce mot comme on le doit celui qui FAIT qui INVENTE qui CREE"  Oevres de Fontenelle Tom pag à Paris    Such was the muse whose rules and practice tell  " Nature's chief masterpiece is writing well"  Ver  THIS high panegyric procured to POPE the acquaintance and afterwards the constant  friendship of the duke of Buckingham who in his ESSAY here alluded to has followed the method of Boileau in discoursing on the various species of poetry to no other purpose than to manifest his own inferiority The piece is indeed of the satyric rather than of the preceptive kind The coldness and neglect with which this writer formed only on the French critics speaks of Milton must be considered as proofs of his want of critical discernment or of critical courage I can recollect no performance of Buckingham that stamps him a true genius His reputation was owing to his rank In reading his poems one is apt to exclaim with our author  What woful stuff this madrigal would be  In some starv'd hackney sonnetteer or me  But let a LORD ONCE OWN the happy lines  How the wit brightens how the style refines  Before his sacred name flies every fault  And each exalted stanza teems with thought  THE best part of Buckingham's ESSAY is that in which he gives a ludicrous account  of the plan of a modern tragedy I should add that his compliment to POPE prefixed to his poems contains a pleasing picture of the sedateness and retirement proper to age after the tumults of public life and by it's moral turn breathes the spirit if not of a poet yet of an amiable old man    Such was ROSCOMMON  Ver    AN ESSAY on Translated Verse seems at first sight to be a barren subject yet Roscommon has decorated it with may precepts of utility and taste and enlivened it with a tale in imitation of Boileau It is indisputably better written than the lastmentioned ESSAY Roscommon was more learned than Buckingham He was bred under Bochart at Caen in Normandy He had laid a design of forming a society for the refining and fixing the standard of our language in which project his intimate friend Dryden was a principal assistant This was the first attempt of that sort and I fear we shall never see  another set on foot in our days even though Mr Johnson has lately given us so excellent a dictionary It may be remarked to the praise of Roscommon that he was the first critic who had taste and spirit enough publicly to praise the Paradise Lost with a noble encomium of which and a rational recommendation of blank verse he concludes his performance Fenton in his Observations on Waller has accurately delineated his character  "His imagination might have probably been more fruitful and sprightly if his judgment had been less severe but that severity delivered in a masculine clear succinct style contributed to make him so eminent in the didactical manner that no man with justice can affirm he was ever equalled by any of our own nation without confessing at the same time that he is inferior to none In some other kinds of writing his genius seems to have wanted fire to attain the point of perfection but who can attain it"  Edit mo pag    Such late was WALSH the muse's judge and friend  Ver  IF POPE has here given too magnificent an elogy to Walsh it must pardonably be attributed to friendship rather than to judgment Walsh was in general a flimzy and frigid writer The Rambler calls his works PAGES OF INANITY His three letters to POPE however are well written His remarks on the nature of pastoral poetry on borrowing from the ancients and against florid conceits are worthy perusal  Vol pag c  POPE owed much to Walsh it was he who gave him a very important piece of advice in his early youth for he used to tell our author that there was one way still left open for him by which he might excell any of his predecessors which was by CORRECTNESS that though indeed we had several great poets we as yet could boast of none that were perfectly CORRECT and that therefore he advised him to make this quality his particular study  CORRECTNESS is a vague term frequently used without meaning and precision It is perpetually the nauseous cant of the French critics and of their advocates and pupils that the English writers are generally INCORRECT If CORRECTNESS implies an absence of petty faults this perhaps may be granted If it means that because their tragedians have avoided the irregularities of Shakespeare and have observed a juster oeconomy in their fables that therefore the Athalia for instance is preferable to Lear the notion is groundless and absurd The Henriade is free from any very gross faults but who will dare to rank it with the Paradise Lost The declamations with which some of their most perfect tragedies abound may be reckoned as contrary to the nature of that species of poetry and as destructive of it's end as the fools or gravediggers of Shakespeare That the French may boast some excellent critics particularly Bossu Boileau Fenelon and Brumoy cannot be denied but that they are sufficient to form a taste upon without having recourse to the  genuine fountains of all polite literature I mean the Grecian writers no one but a superficial sciolist can allow  I CONCLUDE these reflections with a remarkable fact In no polished nation after criticism has been much studied and the rules of writing established has any very extraordinary work ever appeared This has visibly been the case in Greece in Rome and in France after Aristotle Horace and Boileau had written their ARTS OF POETRY In our own country the rules of the drama for instance were never more completely understood than at present yet what UNINTERESTING though FAULTLESS tragedies have we lately seen So much better is our judgment than our execution How to account for the fact here mentioned adequately and justly would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them Whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated  by that timidity and caution which is occasioned by a regard to the dictates of art or whether that philosophical that geometrical and systematical spirit so much in vogue which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite literature by consulting only REASON has not diminished and destroyed SENTIMENT and made our poets write from and to the HEAD rather than the HEART or whether lastly when just models from which the rules have necessarily been drawn have once appeared succeeding writers by ambitiously endeavouring to surpass those just models and to be original and new do not become distorted and unnatural in their thoughts and diction  SECT IV Of the RAPE of the LOCK  IF the Moderns have excelled the Ancients in any species of writing it seems to be in satire and particularly in that kind of satire which is conveyed in the form of the epopee a pleasing vehicle of satire never used by the ancients As the poet disappears in this way of writing and does not deliver the intended censure in his own proper person the satire becomes more delicate because more oblique Add to this that a tale or story more strongly engages and interests the reader than a series of precepts or reproofs or even of characters themselves however lively and natural An heroicomic poem may therefore be justly esteemed the most excellent kind of satire  THE invention of it is usually ascribed to Alessandro Tassoni who in the year published at Paris a poem composed by him  in a few months of the year entitled LA SECCHIA RAPITA or  The Rape of the Bucket  To avoid giving offence it was first printed under the name of Androvini Melisoni It was afterwards reprinted at Venice corrected with the name of the author and with some illustrations of Gasparo Salviani But the learned and curious Crescembini in his  Istoria della Volgar Poesia  Lib i pag In Roma per il Chracas  informs us that it is doubtful whether the invention of the  E tal Poesia puo diffinirsi e chiamarsi immitazione d'azione seria fatto con riso Crescembini ibid  heroicomic poem ought to be ascribed to Tassoni or to Francesco Bracciolini who wrote LO SCHERNO DE GLI DEI which performance though it was printed four years after LA SECCHIA is nevertheless declared in an epistle prefixed to have been written many years sooner The real subject of Tassoni's poem was the war which the inhabitants of Modena declared against those of Bologna on the refusal of the latter to restore to them some towns which had been detained ever since the time  of the emperor Frederic II The author artfully made use of a popular tradition according to which it was believed that a certain woodden bucket which is kept at Modena in the treasury of the cathedral came from Bologna and that it had been forcibly taken away by the Modenese Crescembini adds that because Tassoni had severely ridiculed the Bolognese Bartolomeo Bocchini to revenge his countrymen printed at Venice MDCXLI a tragicoheroicomic poem entitled LE PAZZIE DE SAVI  overo  IL LAMBERTACCIO in which the Modenese are spoken of with much contempt The Italians have a fine turn for works of humour in which they abound They have another poem of this species called MALMANTILE RACQUISTATO written by Lorenzo Lippi in the year MDCLXXVI which Crescembini  Pag lib  highly commends calling it  "Spiritosisimo e legiadrissimo poema giacoso"  It was afterwards reprinted at Florence MDCLXXXVIII with the useful annotations  of Puccio Lamoni a Florentine painter who was himself no contemptible poet  THE LUTRIN of Boileau was the second remarkable poem in which the Serious and Comic were happily blended Boileau himself has given a circumstantial account of what gave occasion to this poem which account because it is entertaining and not printed in the common editions of his works I will insert at length  "I shall not here act like Ariosto who frequently when he is going to relate the most absurd story in the world solemnly protests it to be true and supports it by the authority of archbishop Turpin For my part I freely declare the whole poem of the DESK is nothing but pure fiction that it is all invented even to the name itself of the place where the action passes An odd occasion gave rise to this poem In a company I was lately engaged in the conversation turned upon epic poetry every one delivered his opinion according to his abilities when mine was asked I confirmed  what I had advanced in my Art of Poetry that an heroic poem to be truly excellent ought to be charged with little MATTER which it was the business of invention to support and extend The opinion was warmly contested but after many reasons for and against it happened as it generally does in this sort of disputes that nobody was convinced and that each continued in his own opinion The heat of dispute being over we talked on other subjects and laughed at the violence into which we had been betrayed in discussing a question of so little consequence We moralized on the folly of men who pass almost their whole lives in treating the greatest trifles in a serious manner and in making to themselves an important affair of something quite indifferent To this purpose a country gentleman related a famous quarrel that had lately happened in a little church in his province between the treasurer and the chantor the two principal dignitaries of that church about the place in which a readingdesk was to stand We thought it a droll  affair Upon this one of the critics in company who could not so soon forget our late dispute asked me if I who thought so little MATTER necessary for an heroic poem would undertake to write one on a quarrel so little abounding in incidents as this of the two ecclesiastics  "J'eus plutôt dit pourquoi non que je n'eus fait reflexion sur ce qu'il me demandoit"  This made the company laugh and I could not help laughing with them not in the least imagining that I should ever be able to keep my word But finding myself at leisure in the evening I revolved the subject in my mind and having considered in every view the pleasantry that it would admit of I made twenty verses which I shewed to my friends They were diverted with this beginning The pleasure which I saw these gave them induced me to write twenty more Thus from twenty verses to twenty I lengthened the work to near nine hundred This is the whole history of the trifle I now offer to the publicThis is a new kind of burlesque which I have introduced  into our language for as in the other kind of burlesque that of Scarron Dido and Aeneas spoke like fishwomen and porters in this of mine a  Altered afterwards to a Barber  clockmaker and his wife talk like Dido and Aeneas I do not know whether my poem will have all the qualities requisite to satisfy a reader but I dare flatter myself that it will at least be allowed to have the grace of novelty because I do not conceive that there are any works of this nature in our language the DEFAITES DES BOUTS RIMES of Sarasin being rather a mere allegory than a poem as this is"  ON a subject seemingly so unpromising and incapable of ornament has Boileau found a method of raising a poem full of beautiful imagery which appears like that magnificent city  Petersburg  which the greatest of princes caused to be built in a morass Boileau has enlivened this piece with many unexpected incidents and entertaining episodes  Maxima de nihilo nascitur historia  Prop  Particularly that of the Perruquier in the second canto and of the Battle of the Books in the fifth The satire throughout is poignant though polite to the last degree The indolence and luxury of the priests are ridiculed with the most artful delicacy What a picture has he drawn of the chamber and bed of the treasurer where every thing was calculated to promote and preserve inactivity and ease  Dans le reduit obscur d'un alcove enfoncée  Compare with this the account of the Canon fed by his Housekeeper in Gil Blas  S'eleve un lit de plume a grand frais amassée  Quatre rideaux pompeux par un double contour  En defendent l'entrée a la clartè du jour  La parmi les douceurs d'un tranquille silence  Regne sur le duvet un heureuse Indolence  C'est la que Prelat muni d'un déjeûner  Dormant d'un leger somme attendoit le dIner  La jeunesse en sa fleur brille sur son visage  Son menton sur son sein descend a double étage  Et son corps ramassé dans sa courte grosseur  Faits gémir les cousins sous sa molle épaisseur  Chant  The astonishment of Gilotin the treasurer's almoner to find that his master intends to go  out before dinner is extremely natural and his remonstrances are inimitably droll and pertinent  Lui montre le peril Que midi va sonner  Qu'il va faire s'il sort refroidir le dîner  Quelle fureur ditil quel aveugle caprice  Quand la dîner est prît vous appelle a l'Office  De votre dignitè soûtener mieux l'eclat  Estce pour travailler que vous êtes Prélat  A quoi bon ce dégoût et ce zele inutile  Estil donc pour jeuner Quatre temps ou Vigile  Reprinez vos esprit et souvenez vous bien  Qu'un dîner rechauffé ne valut jamais rien  Warton's ISIS  How admirably is the character of an ignorant and eating priest preserved in this speech of the sleek and pampered Canon Evrard one of the drones who  In that exhaustless hive  On fat pluralities supinely thrive  Chant  Moi ditil qu'a mon âge Ecolier tout noveau  J'aille pour un Lutrin me troubler le cerveau  O le plaisant conseil non non songeons a vivre  Va maigrir si tu veux et secher sur un Livre  Pour moi je lis la Bible autant que l'Alcoran  Je sai ce qu'un Fermier nous doit rendre par an  Sur quelle vigne a Rheims nous avons hypotheque  Vignt muids rangez chez moi sont ma Bibliotheque  En plaçant un Pupitre on croit nous rabbaisser  Mon bras seul sans Latin saura le renverser  Que m'importe qu'Arnauld me condamne ou m'approuve  J'abbats ce qui me nuit par tout oú je le trouve  C'est la mon sentiment A quoi bon tant d'apprêts  Du reste déjeunons Messieurs et beuvons frais  Chant  HIS knowledge of the rents of his church and of the mortgages belonging to it his scorn of the pious and laborious Arnauld his contempt of learning and above all his ruling passion of goodeating are strokes highly comic It is wonderful the ecclesiastics of France were not as much irritated by the publication of the LUTRIN as by the TARTUFFE of Moliere which was suppressed by their interest after it had been acted a few nights although at the same time a very profane farce was permitted to have a long run When Louis XIV expressed to the Prince of Condè his wonder at the different fates of these two pieces and asked the reason of it the prince answered  "In the farce RELIGION  only  is ridiculed but Moliere in the TARTUFFE has attacked even the PRIESTS"  BOILEAU has raised his subjects by many personifications particularly in the beginning of the sixth canto PIETY who had retired to the great Carthusian monastery on the Alps is introduced as repairing to Paris accompanied by FAITH HOPE and CHARITY in order to make her complaint to THEMIS to which may be added the monstrous figure of CHICANERY attended by FAMINE WANT SORROW and RUIN in the beginning of the fifth canto The chief divinity that acts throughout the poem is DISCORD which goddess is represented as coming from a convent of Cordeliers A fine stroke of satire but imitated from the satyrical Ariosto who makes Michael find DISCORD in a cloister instead of SILENCE whom he there searched for in vain NIGHT is also introduced as an actress with great propriety in the third canto where she repairs to the  famous old tower at Montlery in order to find out an owl which she may convey into the DESK and which afterwards produces so ridiculous a consternation SLOTH is another principal personage she also is discovered in the dormitory of a monastery  Les Plaisirs nonchalans solêtrent a l'entour  L'un pâitrit dans un coin l'embonpoint des Chanoines  L'autre broie en riant le vermillon des Moines  Chant  The speech she afterwards makes has a peculiar beauty as it ends in the middle of a line and by that means shews her inability to proceed  THE third heroicomic poem was the DISPENSARY of Garth a palpable imitation of the LUTRIN and the best satire on the phisicians extant except the SANGRADO of Le Sage who have indeed been the object of almost every satirist The behaviour and sentiment of SLOTH the first imaginary being that occurs are almost literally translated from Boileau particularly the compliment  that SLOTH pays to king William whose actions disturb her repose  Or if some cloyster's refuge I implore  Where holy drones o'er dying tapers s  ore  The peals of Nassau's arms these eyes unclose  Mine he molests to give the world repose  Cant  Je croyois loin des lieux d'on ce prince m'exile  Que l'Eglise du moins m'assùroit un azile  Mais envain j'esperois y regner sans effroi  Moines Abbes Prieurs tout s'arme contre moi  Chant  Garth in ridiculing the clergy speaks of that order with more acrimony than Boileau who merely laughs at them But Garth was one of the freethinking WITS at Button's He has introduced many excellent parodies of the classics among which I cannot forbear quoting one which is an imitation of some passages which the reader will remember in Virgil's sixth book and where the circumstances are happily inverted  Boileau says admirably of his phisician Chant Art Poet  Le rhume a son aspect se change en pleurisie  Et par lui la migraine est bientôt phrenesie  Since said the ghost with pity you'll attend  Know I'm Guiacum once your firmest friend  And on this barren beach in discontent  Am doom'd to stay 'till th' angry pow'rs relent  These spectres seam'd with scars that threaten here  The victims of my late ill conduct are  They vex with endless clamours my repose  This wants his palate that demands his nose  And here they execute stern Pluto's will  And ply me ev'ry moment with a pill  Cant  THIS author has been guilty of a strange impropriety which cannot be excused in making the fury DISEASE talk like a critic give rules of writing and a panegyric on the best poets of the age  Cant  The descent into the earth in the sixth canto is a fine mixture of poetry and philosophy the hint is taken from the SYPHILIS of Fracastorius Garth's versification is flowing and musical his style perspicuous and neat and the poem in general abounds with sallies of wit and nervous satire  THE RAPE OF THE LOCK now before us is the fourth and most excellent of the heroicomic poems The subject was a quarrel  occasioned by a little piece of gallantry of Lord Petre who in a party of pleasure found means to cut off a favorite lock of Mrs Arabella Fermour's hair POPE was desired to write it in order to put an end to the quarrel it produced by Mr Caryl who had been secretary to queen Mary author of Sir Solomon Single a comedy and of some translations in Dryden's Miscellanies POPE was accustomed to say  "What I wrote fastest always pleased most"  The first sketch of this exquisite piece which Addison called MERUM SAL was written in less than a fortnight in two cantos only but it was so universally applauded that in the next year our poet enriched it with the machinery of the sylphs and extended it to five cantos when it was printed with a letter to Mrs Fermour far superior to any of Voiture The insertion of the machinery of the sylphs in proper places without the least appearance of it's being aukwardly stitched in is one of the happiest efforts of judgment and art He took the idea of these invisible beings so proper  to be employed in a poem of this nature from a little french book entitled Le Comte de Gabalis of which I have lately met with an account in an entertaining writer  "The Abbe Villars who came from Thoulouse to Paris to make his fortune by preaching is the author of this diverting work The five dialogues of which it consists are the result of those gay conversations in which the Abbe was engaged á la porte de Richelieu with a set of men of fine wit and humour like himself When this book first appeared it was universally read as innocent and amusing But at length it's consequences were perceived and reckoned dangerous at a time when this sort of curiosities began to gain credit Our devout preacher was denied the chair and his book forbidden to be read It was not clear whether the author intended to be ironical or spoke all seriously The second volume which he promised would have decided the question but the unfortunate Abbe was soon afterwards assassinated by ruffians on the road to Lyons The laughers gave out that the  gnomes and sylphs disguised like ruffians had shot him as a punishment for revealing the secrets of the Cabala a crime not to be pardoned by these jealous spirits as Villars himself has declared in his book  Melanges d'Histoire et de Literature By Dom Noel Dargonne disguised under the name of Vigneul Marville Tom prem pag edit Roterdam  "  It may not be improper to give a specimen of this authors manner who has lately been well imitated in the way of mixing jest with earnest in an elegant piece called HERMIPPUS REDIVIVUS The Comte de Gabalis being about to initiate his pupils into the most profound mysteries of the Rosicrusian philosophy advises him to consider seriously whether or no he had courage and resolution sufficient to RENOUNCE all those obstacles which might prevent his arising to that height which the figure of his nativity promised  "Le mot de RENONCER says the scholar m'effraya et je ne doutay point qu'il n'allast me proposer de renoncer au baptesme ou au paradis Ainsi ne sçachant comme me tirer de ce mauvais  pas Renoncer luy disje Monsieur quoi faut il renoncer a quelque chose Urayement reprit il il le faut bien il le faut si necessairement qu'il faut commencer par là Je ne sçay si vous pourrez

avec les femmes  LE COMTE DE GABALIS ou ENTRETIENS sur les Sciences secretes Second ENTRETIEN pag A Amsterdam  "  On a diligent perusal of this book I cannot find that POPE has borrowed any particular circumstances relating to these spirits but merely the general idea of their existence  THESE machines are vastly superior to the allegorical personages of Boileau and Garth not only on account of their novelty but for the exquisite poetry and oblique satire which  they have given the poet an opportunity to display The business and petty concerns of a fine lady receive an air of importance from the notion of their being perpetually overlooked and conducted by the interposition of celestial agents  IT is judicious to open the poem by introducing the Guardian Sylph warning Belinda against some secret impending danger The account which Ariel  Cant ver to ver  gives of the nature office and employment of these inhabitants of air is finely fancied into which several strokes of satire are thrown with great delicacy and address  Think what an equipage thou hast in air  And view with scorn two pages and a chair  The transformation of women of different tempers into different kinds of spirits cannot be too much applauded  These images have been lately expressed in Latin with much purity and elegance and deserve to be here inserted  Mortua lascivum resoluta liquescit in ignem  Aut abit in molles singula nympha notos  Aethereosque trahens haustus tenuissima turba  Versat ad aestivum lucida membra jubar  Gaudet adhuc circum molles operosa puellas  Versari et veneres suppeditare

Termagants in flame  Mount up and take a salamander's name  Soft yielding minds to water glide away  And sip with Nymphs their elemental tea  The graver Prude sinks downward to a gnome  In search of mischief still on earth to roam  The light Coquettes in sylphs aloft repair  And sport and flutter in the fields of air  The description of the  Cant ver  toilette which succeeds is judiciously given in such magnificent turns as dignify the offices performed at it Belinda dressing is painted in as pompous a manner as Achilles arming The canto ends with a circumstance artfully contrived to keep this beautiful machinery in  the readers eye for after the poet has said that the fair heroine  Repairs her smiles awakens ev'ry grace  And calls forth all the wonders of her face  Cant ver  He immediately subjoins  The busy sylphs surround their darling care  These set the head and those divide the hair  Some fold the sleeve whilst others plait the gown  And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own  THE mention of the LOCK  Cant ver  on which the poem turns is rightly reserved to the second canto The sacrifice of the baron to implore success to his undertaking is another instance of our poet's judgement in heightening the subject  Cant ver  The succeeding scene of sailing upon the Thames is most gay and  riant  and impresses the most pleasing pictures upon the imagination Here too the machinery is again introduced with much propriety Ariel summons his denizens  of air who are thus painted with a rich exuberance of fancy  Some to the sun their insect wings unfold  Waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold  Transparent forms too thin for mortal sight  Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light  Loose to the wind their airy garments flew  Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew  Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies  Where light disports in evermingling dyes  While every beam new transient colours flings  Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings  Cant ver  Ariel afterwards enumerates the functions and employments of the sylphs in the following manner where some are supposed to delight in more gross and others in more refined occupations  Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd  By laws eternal to th'aerial kind  Some in the fields of purest aether play  And bask and brighten in the blaze of day  Some guide the course of wandring orbs on high  Or roll the planets through the boundless sky  Some less refin'd beneath the moon's pale light  Pursue the stars that shoot across the night  Or suck the mists in grosser air below  Or dip their pinions in the painted bow  Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main  Or o'er the glebe distill the kindly rain  Cant ver  Those who are fond of tracing images and sentiments to their source may perhaps be inclined to think that the hint of ascribing tasks and offices to such imaginary beings is taken from the Fairies and the Ariel of Shakespeare let the impartial critic determine which has the superiority of fancy The employment of Ariel in the TEMPEST is said to be  To tread the ooze  Of the salt deep  To run upon the sharp wind of the north  To dobusiness in the veins of th'earth  When it is bak'd with frost  To dive into the fire to ride  On the curl'd clouds  And again  In the deep nook where once  Thou calld'st me up at midnight to fetch dew  From the stillvext Bermoothes  Nor must I omit that exquisite song in which his favorite pastime is expressed  Where the bee sucks there suck I  In a cowslip's bell I lie  There I couch when owls do cry  On the bat's back I do fly  After sunset merrily  Merrily merrily shall I live now  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough  With what wildness of imagination but yet with what propriety are the amusements of the fairies pointed out in the MIDSUMMER NIGHT's DREAM amusements proper for none but fairies  'Fore the third part of a minute hence  Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds  Some war with rearmice for their leathern wings  To make my small elves coats and some keep back  The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders  At our queint spirits  Shakespeare only could have thought of the following gratifications for Titania's lover and  they are fit only to be offered to her lover by a fairyqueen  Be kind and courteous to this gentleman  Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes  Feed him with apricocks and dewberries  With purple grapes green figs and mulberries  The honeybags stral from the humblebees  And for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs  And light them at the fiery glowworm's eyes  To have my love to bed and to arise  And pluck the wings from painted butterflies  To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes  If it should be thought that Shakespeare has the merit of being the first who assigned proper employments to imaginary persons in the foregoing lines yet it must be granted that by the addition of the most delicate satire to the most lively fancy POPE in the following passage has excelled any thing in Shakespeare or in any other author  Our humbler province is to tend the fair  Not a less pleasing though less glorious care  To save the powder from too rough a gale  Nor let th'imprison'd essences exhale  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs  To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs  A brighter wash to curl their waving hairs  Assist their blushes and inspire their airs  Nay oft in dreams invention we bestow  To change a flounce or add a furbelow  Cant Ver  THE seeming importance given to every part of female dress each of which is committed to the care and protection of a different sylph with all the solemnity of a general appointing the several posts in his army renders the following passage admirable on account of it's politeness poignancy and poetry  Haste then ye spirits to your charge repair  The fluttering fan be Zephyretta's care  The drops to thee Brillante we consign  And Momentilla let the watch be thine  Do thou Crispissa tend the fav'rite lock  Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock  Cant Ver  The celebrated raillery of Addison on the hooppetticoat has nothing equal to the following  circumstance which marks the difficulty of guarding a part of dress of such high consequence  To fifty chosen sylphs of special note  We trust th'important charge the PETTICOAT  Oft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail  Though stiff with hoops and arm'd with ribs of mail  Form a strong line about the silver bound  And guard the wide circumference around  Cant Ver  RIDET HOC INQUAM VENUS IPSA RIDENT  SIMPLICES NYMPHAE FERUS ET CUPIDO  OUR poet still rises in the delicacy of his satire where he employs with the utmost judgment and elegance all the implements and furniture of the toilette as instruments of punishment to those spirits who shall be careless of their charge of punishment such as sylphs alone could undergo Each of the delinquents  Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins  Be stop'd in vials or transfix'd with pins  Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie  Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye  Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain  While clog'd he beats his silver wings in vain  Or alumstyptics with contracting pow'r  Shrink his thin essence like a rivell'd flow'r  Or as Ixion fix'd the wretch shall feel  The giddy motion of the whirling mill  In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow  And tremble at the sea that froths below  Cant Ver  If Virgil has merited such perpetual commenmendation for exalting his bees by the majesty and magnificence of his diction does not POPE deserve equal praises for the pomp and lustre of his language on so trivial a subject  THE same mastery of language appears in the lively and elegant description of the game at Ombre which is certainly imitated from the Scacchia of Vida and as certainly equal to it if not superiour Both of them have elevated and enlivened their subjects by such similes as the epic poets use but as chess is a play of a far higher order than Ombre  POPE had a more difficult task than Vida to raise this his inferior subject into equal dignity and gracefulness Here again our poet artfully introduces his machinery  Soon as she spreads her hand th'aërial guard  Descend and sit on each important card  First Ariel perch'd upon a mattadore  Cant Ver  The majesty with which the kings of spades and clubs and the knaves of diamonds and clubs are spoken of is very amusing to the imagination and the whole game is conducted with great art and judgment I question whether Hoyle could have played it better than Belinda It is finely contrived that she should be victorious as it occasions a change of fortune in the dreadful loss she was speedily to undergo and gives occasion to the poet to introduce a moral reflection from Virgil which adds to the pleasantry of the story In one of the passages where POPE has copied Vida he has lost the propriety of the original  which arises from the different colours of the  men  at chess  Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs c  Cant Ver  Non aliter campis legio se buxea utrinque  Composuit duplici digestis ordine turmis  Adversisque ambae fulsere coloribus alae  Quam Gallorum acies Alpino frigore lactea  Corpora si tendant albis in praelia signis  Aurorae populos contra et Phaetonte perustos  Insano Aethiopas et nigri Memnonis alas  Vidae Seacchia Ludus Ver c  To this scene succeeds the teatable It is doubtless as hard to make a coffeepot shine in poetry as a plough yet POPE has succeeded in giving elegance to so familiar an object as well as Virgil The guardian spirits are again active and importantly employed  Strait hover round the fair her airy band  Cant Ver  Some as she sipp'd the fuming liquor fann'd  Then follows an instance of assiduity fancied with great delicacy  Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd  Trembling and conscious of the rich brocade  But nothing can excell the behaviour of the sylphs and their wakeful sollicitude for their charge when the danger grows more imminent and the catastrophe approaches  Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair  The methods by which they endeavoured to preserve her from the intended mischief are such only as could be executed by a sylph and have therefore an admirable propriety as well as the utmost elegance  A thousand wings by turns blow back the hair  Cant Ver  And thrice they TWITCH'D the diamond in her ear  Thrice she look'd back and thrice the foe drew near  Still farther to heighten the piece and to preserve the characters of his machines to the last just when the fatal  Observe the many periphrasis's and uncommon appellations POPE has used for  Scissars  which would sound too vulgar"Fatal Engine"Forfex"Sheers"MeetingPoints c  forfex was spread  Ev'n then before the fatal engine clos'd  Cant Ver  A wretched sylph too fondly interpos'd  Fate urg'd the sheers and cut the sylph in twain  But airy substance soon unites again  Which last line is an admirable parody on that passage of Milton which perhaps oddly enough describes Satan wounded  The griding sword with discontinuous wound  Pass'd through him but th'etherial substance clos'd  Not long divisible  Paradise Lost Book Ver    The parodies are some of the most exquisite parts of this poem That which follows from the  "Dum juga montis aper"  of Virgil contains some of the most artful strokes of satire and the most poignant ridicule imaginable  While fish in streams or birds delight in air  Or in a coach and six the British fair  As long as Atalantis shall be read  Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed  While visits shall be paid on solemn days  When numerous waxlights in bright order blaze  While nymphs take treats or assignations give  So long my honour name and praise shall live  Cant Verse  The introduction of frequent parodies on serious and solemn passages of Homer and Virgil give much life and spirit to heroicomic poetry  "Tu dors Prelat tu dors"  in Boileau is the  "  "  of Homer and is full of humour The wife of the barber talks in the language of Dido in her expostulations to her Aeneas at the beginning of the second canto of the Lutrin POPE's parodies of the speech of Sarpedon in Homer canto v verse and of the description of Achilles's scepter canto iv verse and the description of the scales of Jupiter from Homer Virgil and Milton canto v verse are judiciously introduced in their several places are perhaps superiour to those Boileau or Garth have used and are worked up with peculiar pleasantry The mind of the reader is engaged by novelty when it so unexpectedly finds a thought or object it  had been accustomed to survey in another form suddenly arrayed in a ridiculous garb A mixture of comic and ridiculous images with serious and important ones is also no small beauty to this species of poetry As in the following passages where real and imaginary distresses are coupled together  Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive  Cant Ver  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive  Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss  Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die  Nay to carry the climax still higher  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry  E'er felt such rage resentment and despair  This is much superiour to a similar passage in the Dispensary which POPE might have had in his eye  At this the victors own such ecstasies  Cant ad calc  As Memphian priests if their Osiris sneeze  Or champions with Olympic clangor fir'd  Or simp'ring prudes with spritely Nantz inspir'd  Or Sultans rais'd from dungeons to a crown  Or fasting zealots when the sermon's done  These objects have no reference to Garth's subject as almost all of POPE's have in the passage in question where some female foible is glanced at In this same canto the cave of SPLEEN the pictures of her attendants ILLNATURE and AFFECTATION the effects of the vapour that hung over her palace the imaginary diseases she occasions the  Especially when he adjures the goddess by an account of his services Cant iv Ver  If e'er with airy horns I planted heads  Or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds  Or caus'd suspicion where no soul was rude  Or discompos'd the headdress of a prude  Or e'er to costive lapdog gave disease  Hear me and touch Belinda with chagrin  That single act gives half the world the spleen  Nothing can equal this beautiful panegyric but the satirical touches that go before  speech of Umbriel a gnome to this malignant deity the vial of female sorrows the speech of Thalestris to aggravate the misfortune the breaking the vial with its direful effects and the speech of the disconsolate Belinda all  these circumstances are poetically imagined and are far superiour to any of Boileau and Garth How much in character is it for Belinda to mark a very dismal and solitary situation by wishing to be conveyed  Where the gilt chariot never marks the way  Where none learn Ombre none e'er taste Bohea  Cant Ver  Nothing is more common in the poets than to introduce omens as preceeding some important and dreadful event Virgil has nobly described those that preceded the death of Dido The rape of Belinda's LOCK must necessarily also be attended with alarming prodigies With what exquisite satire are they enumerated  Thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell  The tottering china shook without a wind  Cant Ver  And still more to aggravate the direfulness of the impending evil  Nay Poll sate mute and Shock was most unkind  THE chief subject of the fifth and last canto is the battle that ensues and the endeavours of the ladies to recover the hair This battle is described as it ought to be in very lofty and pompous terms a game of romps was never so well dignified before The weapons made use of are the most proper imaginable the lightening of the ladies eyes intolerable frowns a pinch of snuff and a bodkin The machinery is not forgot  Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height  Clapp'd his glad wings and sate to view the fight  Cant Ver  Again when the snuff is given to the baron  The gnomes direct to ev'ry atom just  The pungent grains of titillating dust  Ibid Ver  Boileau and Garth have also each of them enlivened their pieces with a mockfight But Boileau has laid the scene of his action in a bookseller's shop where the combatants happen to encounter each other by chance This conduct is a little inartificial but has  given the satyrist an opportunity of indulging his ruling passion the exposing the bad poets with which France at that time abounded Swift's Battle of the Books at the end of the Tale of a Tub is evidently taken from this  Chant  battle of Boileau which is excellent in its kind The fight of the physicians in the Dispensary is one of its most shining parts There is a vast deal of propriety as well as pleasantry in the weapons Garth has given to his warriours They are armed much in character with caustics emetics and cathartics with buckthorn and steelpills with syringes bedpans and urinals The execution is exactly proportioned to the deadliness of such irresistible weapons and the wounds inflicted are suitable to the nature of each different instrument said to inflict them  Cant  WE are now arrived to the grand catastrophe of the poem the invaluable Lock which is so eagerly sought is irrecoverably lost And here our poet has made a judicious  use of that celebrated fiction of Ariosto that all things lost on earth are treasured in the moon How such a fiction can have place in an epic poem it becomes the defenders of this extravagant and lawless rhapsodist to justtify but in a comic one it appears with grace and consistency The whole passage in Ariosto is full of wit and satire for wit and satire were the chief and characteristical excellencies of Ariosto  For the best and most judicious account I know of the genius of Ariosto see Warton's OBSERVATIONS on the FAIRY QUEEN of Spenser Consult particularly pages of that work where his merits are adjusted impartially  In this repository in the lunar sphere says the SPRIGHTLY Italian were to be found  Le lachrime e i sospiri de gli amanti  L'inutil' tempo che si perde a gioco  E l'otio lungo d'huomini ignoranti  Vani disegni che non han mai loco  I vani desiderii sono tanti  Che la piu parte ingombra di quel loco  Cio che in summa qua glu perdesti mai  La su saltendo ritrovar potrai  Orlando Furioso Cant  It is very remarkable that the poet had the boldness to place among these imaginary treasures  the famous deed of gift of Constantine to Pope Silvester  "If says he I may be allowed to say this"  Questo era il dono se pero dir lece  Che Constantino al buon Silvestre fece  It may be observed in general to the honour of the poets both ancient and modern that they have ever been some of the first who have detected and opposed the false claims and mischievous usurpations of superstition and slavery Nor can this be wondered at since these two are the greatest enemies not only to all true happiness but to all true genius  THE denouement as a pedantic disciple of Bossu would call it of this poem is well conducted What is become of this important LOCK OF HAIR It is made a constellation with that of Berenice so celebrated by Callimachus As it rises to heaven  The sylphs behold it kindling as it flies  Cant Ver  And pleas'd pursue its progress through the skies  One cannot sufficiently applaud the art of the poet in constantly keeping in the reader's view the machinery of the poem to the very last Even when the Lock is transformed the sylphs who had so carefully guarded it are here once again artfully mentioned as finally rejoicing in it's honourable transformation  IN reading the Lutrin I have always been struck with the impropriety of so serious a conclusion as Boileau has given to so ludicrous a poem PIETY and JUSTICE are beings rather too awful to have any concern in the celebrated desk They appear as much out of place and season as would the archbishop of Paris in his pontifical robes in an harlequin entertainment  POPE does not desert his favorite Lock even after it becomes a constellation and the uses he assigns to it are indeed admirable  This the beau monde shall from the mall survey  Cant Ver  And hail with music it's propitious ray  This the blest lover shall for  Venus  take  And send up prayers from Rosamunda's lake  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies  When next he looks through Galileo's eyes  And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom  The fate of Louis and the fall of Rome  This is at once DULCE LOQUI and RIDERE DECORUM  UPON the whole I hope it will not be thought an exaggerated panegyric to say that the RAPE OF THE LOCK is the BEST SATIRE extant that it contains the truest and liveliest picture of modern life and that the subject is of a more elegant nature as well as more artfully conducted than that of any other heroicomic poem POPE here appears in the light of a man of gallantry and of a thorough knowledge of the world and indeed he had nothing in his carriage and deportment of that affected singularity which has induced some men of genius to despise and depart from the established rules of politeness and civil life For all poets have not practiced the sober and rational advice of Boileau  Que les vers ne soient pas votre eternel emploi  Cultivez vos amis soyez homme de foi  C'est peu d'etre agréeable et charmant dans un livre  Il fait savoir encore et converser et vivre  L'Art Poetique Chant  OUR nation can boast also of having produced one or two more poems of the burlesque kind that are excellent particularly the SPLENDID SHILLING that admirable copy of the solemn irony of Cervantes who is the father and unrivalled model of the true mockheroic and the MUSCIPULA written with the purity of Virgil whom the author so perfectly understood and with the pleasantry of Lucian to which I cannot forbear adding the SCRIBLERIAD of Mr Cambridge  This learned and ingenious writer hath made a new remark in his preface worth examination and attention He says that in first reading the  four  celebrated mock heroic poems he perceived they had all some radical defect That at last he found by a diligent perusal of Don Quixote that  Propriety  was the fundamental excellence of that Work That all the  Marvellous  was reconcileable to  Probability  as the author led his hero into  that  species of absurdity only which it was  natural  for an imagination heated with the continual reading of books of chivalry to fall into That the want of attention to this was the fundamental error of those poems For with what PROPRIETY do  Churchmen Physicians Beaux  and  Belles  or  Booksellers  in the Lutrin Dispensary Rape of the Lock and Dunciad address themselves to heathen Gods offer sacrifices consult oracles or talk the language of Homer and of the heroes of antiquity    IF some of the most candid among the French critics begin to acknowledge that  they have produced nothing in point of SUBLIMITY and MAJESTY equal to the Paradise Lost we may also venture to affirm that in point of DELICACY ELEGANCE and fineturned RAILLERY on which they have so much valued themselves they have produced nothing equal to the RAPE OF THE LOCK It is in this composition POPE principally appears a POET in which he has displayed more imagination than in all his other works taken together It should however be remembered that he was not the FIRST former and creator of those beautiful machines the sylphs on which his claim to imagination is chiefly founded He found them existing ready to his hand but has indeed employed them with singular judgment and artifice  SECT V Of The ELEGY to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady The PROLOGUE to Cato and The EPILOGUE to Jane Shore  THE ELEGY  to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady  which is next to be spoken of as it came from the heart is very tender and pathetic more so I think than any other copy of verses of our author We are unacquainted with her history and with that series of misfortunes which seems to have drawn on the melancholy catastrophe alluded to in the beginning of this ELEGY She is said to be the same person to whom the Duke of Buckingham has addressed some lines viz  "To a Lady designing to retire into a Monastery"  This design is also hinted at in POPE's Letters  Vol vii Pag Octavo Edition  where he says in a letter addressed I presume to this very person  "If you are resolved in revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may  afford it I believe your design will be vain for even in a monastery your devotions cannot carry you so far towards the next world as to make this lose sight of you but you will be like a star that while it is fixed in heaven shines over all the earth Wheresoever providence shall dispose of the most valuable thing I know I shall ever follow you with my sincerest wishes and my best thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you when you never hear of me or them Your own guardian angels cannot be more constant nor more silent"  THIS ELEGY opens with a striking abruptness and a strong image the poet fancies he beholds suddenly the phantom of his murdered friend  What beck'ning ghost along the moonlight shade  Invites my steps and points to yonder glade  'Tis shebut why that bleeding bosom gor'd  Why dimly gleams the visionary sword  This question alarms the reader and puts one in mind of that lively and affecting image  in the prophecy of Isaiah so vigorously conceived that it places the object full in one's eyes  "Who is this that cometh from Edom With dyed garments from Bosra  Chap Ver  "  Akenside has begun one of his odes in the like manner  O fly 'tis dire SUSPICION's mein  And meditating plagues unseen  The sorc'ress hither bends  Behold her torch in gall imbru'd  Behold her garments drop with blood  Of lovers and of friends  The execrations on the cruelties of this lady's relations which had driven her to this deplorable extremity are very spirited and forcible especially where the poet says emphatically  Thus if eternal justice rules the ball  Thus shall your wives and thus your children fall  He describes afterwards the desolation of this family by the following lively circumstance and prosopopoeia  There passengers shall stand and pointing say  While the long funerals blacken all the way  Lo these were they whose souls the furies steel'd  And curst with hearts unknowing how to yield  So perish all whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow  For others good or melt at others woe  The incident of her dying in a country remote from her relations and acquaintance is touched with great tenderness and introduced with propriety to aggravate and heighten her lamentable fate  No friend's complaint no kind domestic tear  Something like that pathetic stroke in the Philoctetes of Sophocles who among other heavy circumstances of distress is said not to have near him any  Ver Not to be translated  Pleas'd thy pale ghost or grac'd thy mournful bier  By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd  By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd  By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd  By strangers honour'd and by strangers mourn'd  The force of the repetition of the significant epithet  foreign  need not be pointed out to any reader of sensibility The rite of sepulture of which she was deprived from the  manner of her death is glanced at with great delicacy nay and a very poetical use is made of it  What though no sacred earth allow thee room  Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb  Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be drest  And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast  There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow  There the first roses of the year shall blow  IF this ELEGY be so excellent it may be ascribed to this cause that the occasion of it was real for it is certainly an indisputable maxim  "That nature is more powerful than fancy that we can always feel more than we can imagine and that the most artful fiction must give way to truth"  When Polus the celebrated actor once affected his audience with more than ordinary emotions it was  "luctû et lamentis veris"  by bursting out into real cries and tears for in personating Electra weeping over the supposed urn of her brother Orestes he held in his hands the real ashes of his own son lately dead  Aul Gell Noct Attic Lib Cap  Events that have actually  happened are after all the properest subjects for poetry The best eclogue of  The First  Virgil the best ode of  Ode Lib  Horace are founded on real incidents If we briefly cast our eyes over the most interesting and affecting stories ancient or modern we shall find that they are such as however adorned and a little diversified are yet grounded on true history and on real matters of fact Such for instance among the ancients are the stories of Joseph of Edipus the Trojan war and and its consequences of Virginia and the Horatii such among the moderns are the stories of king Lear the Cid Romeo and Juliet and Oronooko The series of events contained in these stories seem far to surpass the utmost powers of human imagination In the bestconducted fiction some mark of improbability and incoherence will still appear  I SHALL only add to these a tale literally true which the admirable DANTE has introduced  in his Inferno and which is not sufficiently known I cannot recollect any passage in any writer whatever so truly pathetic Ugolino a Florentine Count is giving the description of his being imprisoned with his children by the archbishop Ruggieri  "The hour approached when we expected to have something brought us to eat But instead of seeing any food appear  It was thought not improper to distinguis  the more moving passages by Italics Mr Baretti's just translation is here used See his DISSERTATION on the Italian Poets  I heard the doors of that horrible dungeon more closely barred  I beheld my little children  in silence  and could not weep My heart was petrified the little wretches wept and my dear Anselm said  Tu guardi sì padre che hai father you look on us what ails you  I could neither weep nor answer and continued swallowed up in silent agony all that day and the following night even till the dawn of day As soon as a glimmering ray darted through the doleful prison that I could view  again those four faces  in which my own image was impressed  I  gnawed both my hands  with grief and rage My children believing I did this through eagerness to eat raising themselves suddenly up said to me  My father our torments would be less if you would allay the rage of your hunger upon us  I restrained myself that I might not encrease their misery  We were all mute that day and the following  Quel di e l'altro stemmo tutti muti Ah cruel earth why dost not thou swallow us up at once The fourth day being come Gaddo falling extended at my feet cryed  Padre mio che non m'ajuti My father why do not you help me  and died The other three expired one after the other between the fifth and sixth days famished as thou seest me now And I  being seized with blindness  began to go  groping upon them with my hands and Feet  and continued calling them by their  names three days  after they were dead  Etre di li chiamai poichè fur morti  then hunger vanquished my grief"  IF this inimitable description had been to be found in Homer the Greek tragedies or  Virgil how many commentaries and panegyrics would it have given rise to What shall shall we say or think of the genius able to produce it There are many of the same nature and perhaps the Inferno of Dante is the next composition to the Iliad in point of originality and sublimity And with regard to the Pathetic let this tale stand a testimony of his abilities for my own part I truly believe it was never carried to a greater heighth It is remarkable that Chaucer appears to have been particularly struck with this tale in Dante having highly commended this  "grete poete of Italie"  for this narration with a summary of which he concludes the Monke's Tale  Urry's Chaucer Pag Ver  THE PROLOGUE to  Addison's Tragedy of Cato  is superiour to any prologue of Dryden who notwithstanding is so justly celebrated for this species of writing The prologues of Dryden are satyrical and facetious this of POPE is solemn and sublime as the subject  required Those of Dryden contain general topics of criticism and wit and may precede any play whatsoever even tragedy or comedy This of POPE is particular and appropriated to the tragedy alone which it was designed to introduce The most striking images and allusions it contains are taken with judgment from some passages in the life of Cato himself Such is that fine stroke more lofty than any thing in the tragedy itself where the poet says that when Caesar amid the pomp and magnificence of a triumph  Shew'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state  As her dead father's reverend image past  The pomp was darkned and the day o'ercast  The triumph ceas'dTears gush'd from ev'ry eye  The world's great victor pass'd unheeded by  Her last good man dejected Rome ador'd  And honour'd Caesar's less than Cato's sword  Such again is the happy allusion to an old story mentioned in Martial of this sage going into the theatre and immediately coming out of it again  Such plays alone should win a British ear  As Cato's self had not disdain'd to hear  From which he draws an artful panegyric on the purity and excellence of the play he was celebrating  WITH respect to sprightly turns and poignancy of wit the prologues of Dryden have not been equalled The curious reader may consult particularly a collection of twenty of them together in the first edition of the first volume of Tonson's Miscellanies  Pag  many of them and the most excellent written on occasion of the players going to Oxford a custom for the neglect of which no good reason can be assigned except perhaps that even the players must now forsooth follow the contemptible cant of decrying that most learned university and of doing nothing that may contribute to its pleasure and emolument At this time Dryden was so famous for his prologues that no piece was relished nor would the theatres scarcely venture to produce it if it wanted this fashionable ornament To this purpose an anecdote is recorded of  Southerne who on bringing his first play on the stage did not fail to bespeak a prologue of the artist in vogue The usual price had ever been four guineas In the present case Dryden insisted that he must have six for his work  "which said the mercantile bard is out of no disrespect to you young man but the players have had my goods too cheap"  THE tragedy of Cato itself is a glaring instance of the force of party  When Addison spoke of the secretary of state at that time he always called him in the language of Shakespeare  "  That canker'd Bolingbroke  "  Notwithstanding this Addison assured POPE he did not bring his tragedy on the stage with any party views nay desired POPE to carry the poem to the Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke for their perusal The play however was always considered as a warning to the people that liberty was in danger during that tory ministry To obviate the strong impressions that so popular a performance might make on the minds of the audience Lord Bolingbroke in the midst of their violent applauses sent for Booth who played Cato one night into his box between the acts and presented him with fifty guineas in acknowledgment as he expressed it with great address for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator  so heavy and declamatory a drama would never have met with such rapid and amazing success if every  line and sentiment had not been particularly tortured and applied to recent events and the reigning disputes of the times The purity and energy of the diction and the loftiness of the sentiments copied in a great measure from Lucan Tacitus and Seneca the philosopher merit approbation But I have always thought that those pompous Roman sentiments are not so difficult to be produced as is vulgarly imagined and which indeed dazzle only the vulgar A stroke of nature is in my opinion worth a hundred such thoughts as  When vice prevails and impious men bear sway  The post of honour is a private station  CATO is a fine dialogue on liberty and the love of one's country but considered as a dramatic performance nay as a model of a just tragedy as some have affectedly represented it it must be owned to want ACTION and PATHOS the two hinges I presume on which a just tragedy ought necessarily to turn and without which it cannot subsist It wants  also CHARACTER although that be not so essentially necessary to a tragedy as ACTION Syphax indeed in his  Act Scen  interview with Juba bears some marks of a rough African the speeches of the rest may be transferred to any of the personages concerned The simile drawn from mount Atlas and the description of the Numidian traveller smothered in the desart are indeed in character but sufficiently obvious How Addison could fall into the false and unnatural custom of ending his three first acts with similes is amazing in so chast and correct a writer The loves of Juba and Marcia of Portius and Lucia are vicious and insipid episodes debase the dignity and destroy the unity of the fable  ONE would imagine from the practice of our modern playwrights that love was the only passion capable of producing any great calamities in human life for this passion has engrossed and been impertinently introduced into  When the resolution of Medea to kill her children is almost disarmed and destroyed by looking at them and by their smiling upon her she breaks out  Heu heu cur me oculis aspicitis liberi  Cur arridetis hoc extremo risû  Heu heu quid faciam cor enim mihi disperit  Euripid Medea Ver  No sentiments of the Lover can be so tender and so deeply touching as th  se of the Mother  all subjects  In the Cinna of Corneille which the prince of Condé called  "the

happen to the empire of the world was debating In his imitation of the Orestes of Sophocles Crebillon has introduced a frigid loveintrigue Achilles must be in love in the Iphigenia of Racine and the rough Mithridates must be involved in this allsubduing passion A passion however it is that will always shine upon the stage where it is introduced as the chief subject but not subordinate and  secondary  L'Amour furieux criminel malheureux suivi de remords arrache de nobles larmes Point de milieu il faut ou que l'amour domine en tiran ou qu'il ne paroisse pas  Oeuvres de Voltaire Tom Pag  I have just been told that Crebillon has also very lately made poor Philoctetes in love in his Desart Island  Thus perhaps there cannot be finer subjects for a drama than Phaedra Romeo Othello and Monimia The whole distress in these pieces arises  singly  from this unfortunate passion carried to an extreme  The introduction of female actresses on the modern stage together with that importance which the ladies in these latter ages have justly gained in comparison to what the ancients allowed them are the two great reasons among others of the prevalence of these tender tales The ladies of Athens had not interest enough to damn a piece of Sophocles or Euripides  The GREATER passions were the constant subjects of the Grecian the TENDERER ones of the French and English theatres Terror reigned in the former pity occupies the latter The moderns may yet boast of some pieces that are not emasculated with this epidemical effeminacy Racine was at last convinced of its impropriety and gave the public his Athaliah in which were no parts commonly called by the French l'amoreux  et de l'amoreuse which were always given to their two capital actors The Merope and Orestes of Voltaire are likewise free from any illplaced tenderness and romantic gallantry For which he has merited the praises of the learned father Tournemine in a letter to his friend father Brumoy  Les Oevres de Voltaire tom  But LEAR and MACBETH are also striking instances what interesting tragedies may be written without having recourse to a lovestory It is pity that the tragedy of Cato in which all the rules of the drama as far as the mechanism of writing reaches is not exact with respect to the unity of time There was no occasion to extend the time of the fable longer than the mere representation takes up all might have passed in the compass of three hours from the morning with a description of which the play opens if the poet in the fourth scene of the fifth act had not talked of the  setting  sun playing on the armour of the soldiers  HAVING been imperceptibly led into this  little criticism on the tragedy of Cato I beg leave to speak a few words on some other of Addison's pieces The  Tickell has ridiculously marked the author's age to be but twenty two and twenty seven as if these verses were extraordinary efforts at that age To these however Addison owed his introduction at court and his acquaintance with that polite patron Lord Somers  first of his poems addrest to Dryden Sir John Somers and king William are languid prosaic and void of any poetical imagery or spirit The Letter from Italy is by no means equal to a subject so fruitful of genuine poetry and which might have warmed the most cold and correct imagination One would have expected a young traveller in the height of his genius and judgment would have broke out into some strokes of enthusiasm With what flatness and unfeelingness has he spoken of statuary and painting Raphäel never received a more flegmatic elogy The slavery and superstition of the present Romans are well touched upon towards the conclusion but I will venture to name a little piece on a parallel subject that greatly excells this celebrated  Letter and in which are as much lively and original imagery strong painting and manly sentiments of freedom as I have ever read in our language It is a Copy of Verses written at Virgil's Tomb and printed in Dodsley's  Vol pag  Miscellanies  THAT there are many well wrought descriptions and even pathetic strokes in the Campaign it would be stupidity and malignity to deny But surely the regular march which the poet has observed from one town to another as if he had been a commissary of the army cannot well be excused There is a passage in Boileau so remarkably opposite to this fault of Addison that one would almost be tempted to think he had the Campaign in his eye when he wrote it if the time would admit  But the Art of Poetry was written in the year many years before the Campaign Addison might have profited by this rule of his acquaintance for whom he had a great respect  it  Loin ces rimeurs craintiss dont l'esprit phlegmatique  Garde dans ses fureurs un ordre didactique  Qui chantant d'un

que Mezerai  Ait fait déja tomberles remparts de  L'Art poetique Ch  Coutrai  The most spirited verses Addison has written are an Imitation of the third ode of the third book of Horace which is indeed performed with energy and vigour and his compliment to Kneller on the picture of king George the first The occasion of this last poem is peculiarly happy for among the works of Phidias which he enumerates he selects such statues as exactly mark and characterise the last six British kings and queens  CHARLES II famous for his lewdness the allusion to his being concealed in the oak is artful JAMES II WILLIAM III Queen MARY who had no heirs and was a great workwoman Queen ANNE married to the PRINCE of Denmark who lost the D of Gloucester in his youth George I who conquered the Highland

impious league their king defy'd  There is scarcely I believe any instance where mythology has been applied with so much delicacy and dexterity and has been contrived to answer in its application so minutely exactly and in so many corresponding circumstances  WHATEVER censures we have here too  boldly perhaps ventured to deliver on the  professed  poetry of Addison yet must we candidly own that in various parts of his proseessays are to be found many strokes of genuine and sublime poetry many marks of a vigorous and exuberant imagination Particularly in the noble allegory of Pain and Pleasure the Vision of Mirza the story of Maraton and Yaratilda of Constantia and Theodosius and the beautiful eastern tale of Abdallah and Balsora and many others together with several strokes in the Essay on the pleasures of imagination It has been the lot of many great names not to have been able to express themselves with beauty and propriety in the fetters of verse in their respective languages who have yet manifested the force fertility and creative power of a most poetic genius in prose  In some of the eastern stories lately published in the ADVENTURER a vast and noble invention is displayed and this too by an author that I have never heard has written any considerable verses See particularly the story of Amurath N  o  of Nouraddin and Amana N  o  and of Carazan N  o  by Mr Hawkesworth  This was the case of Plato of  Lucian of Fenelon of Sir Philip Sidney and of Dr T Burnet who in his Theory of the Earth has displayed an imagination very nearly equal to that of Milton  Maenia mundi  Discedunt totum video per Inane geri res  After all the chief and characteristical excellency of Addison was his HUMOUR for in humour no mortal has excelled him except Moliere Witness the character of Sir Roger de Coverly so original so natural and so inviolably preserved  Vol II during the month of July See the characters of Will Wimble Moll White and the justices of the quorum p seq And Vol Sir Roger at Westminster Abby and at the tragedy of the Distrest Mother with the Spectator  particularly in the month which the Spectator spends at his hall in the country Witness also the Drummer that excellent and neglected comedy that just picture of life and real manners where the poet never speaks in his own person or totally drops or forgets a character for the sake of introducing a brilliant simile or acute  remark where no train is laid for wit no JEREMYS or BENS are suffer'd to appear  THE EPILOGUE  to Jane Shore  is the last piece that belongs to this Section the title of which by this time the reader may have possibly forgot It is written with the air of gallantry and raillery which by a strange perversion of taste the audience expects in all epilogues to the most serious and pathetic pieces To recommend cuckoldom and palliate adultery is their usual intent I wonder Mrs Oldfield was not suffered to speak it for it is superiour to that which was used on the occasion In this taste Garrick has written some that abound in spirit and drollery Rowe's genius  There are however some images in Rowe strongly painted such particularly as the following which is worthy of Spenser speaking of the tower  Methinks SUSPICION and DISTRUST dwell here  Staring  with  meagre  forms thro'  grated  windows  Lady Jane Grey Act Sc  was rather delicate and tender than strong and pathetic his compositions sooth us with a tranquill and tender sort of complacency rather than cleave the heart with  pangs of commiseration His distresses are entirely founded on the passion of love His diction is extremely elegant and chaste and his versification highly melodious His plays are declamations rather than dialogues and his characters are general and undistinguished from each other Such a furious character as that of Bajazet is easily drawn and let me add easily acted There is a want of unity in the fable of Tamerlane The death's head dead body and stage hung in mourning in the Fair Penitent are inartificial and mechanical methods of affecting an audience In a word his plays are musical and pleasing poems but inactive and unmoving tragedies This of Jane Shore is I think the most interesting and affecting of any he has given us but probability is sadly violated in it by the neglect of the unity of time For a person to be supposed to be starved during the representation of five acts is a striking instance of the absurdity of this violation In this piece as in all of Rowe's are many florid speeches utterly inconsistent with the state  situation of the distressful personages who speak them When Shore first meets with her husband she says  Act Sc  Art thou not risen by miracle from death  Thy shroud is fall'n from off thee and the grave  Was bid to give thee up that thou might'st come  The messenger of grace and goodness to me  He has then added some lines intolerably flowery and unnatural  Give me your drops ye soft descending rains  Give me your streams ye neverceasing springs  That my sad eyes may still supply my duty  And feed an everlasting flood of sorrow  This is of a far distant strain from those tender and simple exclamations she uses when her husband offers her some rich conserves    ibid  How can you be so good  And again  Have you forgot  The costly string of pearl you brought me home  And ty'd about my neck  how could I leave you  She continues to gaze on him with earnestness and instead of eating as he entreats her she observes  You're strangely alter'd  Say gentle Belmour is he not how pale  Your visage is become Your eyes are hollow  Nay you are wrinkled too  To which she instantly subjoins struck with the idea that she herself was the unhappy cause of this alteration  Alas the day  My wretchedness has cost you many a tear  And many a bitter pang since last we parted  What she answers to her husband when he asks her movingly  Why dost thou fix thy dying eyes upon me  With such an earnest such a piteous look  As if thy heart was full of some sad meaning  Thou couldst not speak  Is pathetic to a great degree and  Forgive me  but  forgive me  These few words far exceed the most pompous  declamations of  Cato  The interview betwixt Jane Shore and Alicia in the middle of this act is also very affecting where the madness of Alicia is well painted But of all representations of madness that of Clementina in the History of Sir Charles Grandison is the most deeply interesting I know not whether even the madness of Lear is wrought up and expressed by so many little strokes of nature and genuine passion It is absolute pedantry to prefer and compare the madness of Orestes in Euripides to this of Clementina  IT is probable that this is become the most popular and pleasing tragedy of all Rowe's works because it is founded on our own history It is to be wished that our writers would more frequently search for subjects in the annals of England which afford many striking and pathetic events proper for the stage We have been too long attached to Grecian and Roman stories In truth the DOMESTICA FACTA are more interesting as well as more useful more interesting because  we all think ourselves concerned in the actions and fates of our countrymen more useful because the characters and manners bid the fairest to be true and natural when they are drawn from models with which we are exactly acquainted The Turks the Persians and Americans of our poets are in reality distinguished from Englishmen only by their turbans and feathers and think and act as if they were born and educated within the bills of mortality The historical plays of  Milton has left in a manuscript thirty three subjects for tragedies all taken from the English annals which manuscript the curious reader may see printed in Newton's Edit of Milton Oct Vol pag And in Birch's life of Milton prefixed to his edition of Milton's proseworks and in Peck's Miscellanea Curiosa  Shakespeare are always particularly grateful to the spectator who loves to see and hear our own Harrys and Edwards better than all the Achille'ss or Brutus's that ever existed In the choice of a domestic story however much judgment and circumspection must be exerted to select one of a proper aera neither of too ancient or  of too modern a date The manners of times very ancient we shall be as apt to falsify as those of the Greeks and Romans And recent events with which we are thoroughly acquainted are deprived of the power of impressing solemnity and awe by their notoriety and familiarity Age softens and wears away all those disgracing and depreciating circumstances which attend modern transactions merely because they are modern Lucan was much embarrassed by the proximity of the times he treated of On this very account as well as others the best tragedy that could be possibly written on the murder of Charles I would be coldly received Racine ventured to write on a recent history in his Bajazet but would not have attempted it had he not thought that the distance of his hero's country repaired in some measure the nearness of the time in which he lived  "Major a longinquo reverentia"  POPE it is said had framed a design of writing an epic poem on a fact recorded in  our old annalists and therefore more engaging to an Englishman on the ARRIVAL of BRUTUS the supposed grandson of Aeneas in our island and the settlement of the first foundations of the British monarchy A full scope might have been given to a vigorous imagination to embellish a fiction drawn from the bosom of the remotest antiquity Some tale equally venerable and ancient it was also the purpose of Milton  Whether he intended as A POET expresses it To  Record old ARTHUR's magic tale  And EDWARD fierce in sable male  Sing royal BRUTUS' lawless doom  And brave BONDUCA scourge of Rome  Great PENDRAGON's fairbranched line  Stern ARVIRAGE or old LOCRINE  THE UNION pag  "An historical poem says Milton in the above mentioned manuscript may be founded somewhere in Alfred's reign especially at his issuing out of Edelingsey on the Danes whose actions are well like those of Ulysses"  In Milton's history of England may be seen the story of Brutus here in question with which he seems pleased as it suited the romantic turn of his mind See his MANSUS  Siquando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges  Arthurumque etiam c  Ipse ego Dardanias Rutupina per aequora puppes  Dicam Pandrasidos regnum vetus Inogeniae  Brennumque Arviragumque c  And particularly the EPITAPHIUM DAMONIS  to adorn for he says in his  Reason of church government  Page  "I am meditating what king or knight BEFORE THE CONQUEST might be chosen in whom to lay the pattern of a christian hero"  But shall I be pardoned for suspecting that POPE would not have succeeded in this design that so DIDACTIC a genius would have been deficient in that SUBLIME and PATHETIC which are the main nerves of the epopea that he would have given us many elegant descriptions and many GENERAL characters well drawn but would have failed to set before our eyes the REALITY of these objects and the ACTIONS of these characters for Homer professedly draws no characters but gives us to collect them from the looks and behaviour of each person he introduces that POPE's close and constant reasoning had impaired and crushed the faculty of imagination that the political reflections in this piece would in all probability have been more numerous than the affecting strokes of nature that it would have more resembled the HENRIADE  than the ILIAD or even the GIERUSALEMME LIBERATA that it would have appeared if this scheme had been executed how much and for what reasons the man that is skilful in painting modern life and the most secret foibles and follies of his cotemporaries is THEREFORE disqualified for representing the ages of heroism and that simple life which alone epic poetry can gracefully describe in a word that this composition would have shewn more of the PHILOSOPHER than of the POET Add to all this that it was to have been written in rhyme a circumstance sufficient of itself alone to overwhelm and extinguish all enthusiasm and produce endless tautologies and circumlocutions Are not these suppositions strengthened by what Dr Warburton  Vol III  has informed us namely that POPE in this poem intended to have treated amply  "of all that regarded civil regimen or the science of politics that the several forms of a republic were here to have been examined and explained together  with the several modes of religious worship as far forth as they affect society"  than which surely there could not have been a more improper subject for an epic poem  IT is not impertinent to observe for the sake of those who are fond of the history of literature and of the human mind in the progress of it that the very first poem that appeared in France any thing like an epic poem was on this identical subject of Brutus arriving in England It was written by Master EUSTACHE so early as in the reign of Louis the seventh sirnamed the Young who ascended the throne in the year and who was the husband of the celebrated Eleonora afterwards divorced and married to our Henry the second The author called it Le ROMAN de Brut Every piece of poetry was at that time denominated a romance The latin language ceased to be regularly spoken in France about the ninth century and was succeeded by what was called the  Romance  tongue a mixture of the language  of the Francs and of bad Latin The species of writing called  Romans  began in the tenth century according to the opinion of the Benedictine fathers  Hist Lit T  who have well refuted M Fleuri and Calmet who make them less ancient by two hundred years The poem or  Roman  we are speaking of is full of wonderful and improbable tales and supernatural adventures suited to the taste of so barbarous an age It is matter of some curiosity to see a specimen of the style of this eldest of the French poets This is his exordium  Qui veut ouir qui veut scavoir  De roi en roi d'hoir en hoir  Qui cils furent d'où cils vinrent  Qui Angleterre primes tinrent  We may judge from this passage of the state of the language Master Eustache has been particularly careful to mark the time in which he lived and wrote by his two concluding lines  L'an mil cent cinquantecinq ans  Fit Maistre Eustache ces Romans  I will take leave to add that the second poem now remaining in the French language was entitled The Romance of Alexander the Great It was the confederated work of four authors famous in their time Lambert le Court and Alexander of Paris sung the exploits of Alexander Peter de Saint Clost wrote his will in verse the writing the will of a hero being then a common topic and John le Nivelois added a book concerning the manner in which his death was revenged It is remarkable that before this time all the  Romans  had been composed in verses of eight syllables but in this piece the four authors first used verses of TWELVE syllables as more solemn and majestic And this was the origin tho' but little known of those verses which we now call ALEXANDRINES the French heroic measure the name being derived from Alexander the hero of the piece or from Alexander the most celebrated of the four poets concerned in this work These were the most applauded poets of that age Fauchet highly commends this poem particularly  a passage where a Cavalier is struck to the ground with a lance who says the old bard  Du long comme il etoit mesura la campagne  Which is not inferior to Virgil's  Hesperiam metire jacens  One would not imagine this line had been written so early as the middle of the twelfth century A great and truly learned antiquary  The president Henault Histoire de France Tom p a Paris  has remarked for the honour of our country that about this time appeared the first traces of any theatre  "A monk called Geoffry who was afterwards abbot of St Albans in England employed in the education of youth made his pupils represent with proper scenes and dresses tragedies of piety The subject of the first dramatic piece was the miracles of saint Catharine which says my author appeared long before any of our representations of the MYSTERIES"  SECT VI Of the Epistle of SAPPHO to PHAON and of ELOISA to ABELARD  IT is no small merit in Ovid to have invented this beautiful species of writing epistles under feigned characters It is a high improvement on the Greek elegy to which its dramatic nature renders it greatly superior It is indeed no other than a passionate soliloquy in which the mind gives vent to the distresses and emotions under which it labours but by being directed and addressed to a particular person it gains a degree of propriety that the bestconducted soliloquy in a tragedy must ever want Our impatience under any pressures of grief and disorder of mind makes such passionate expostulations with the persons supposed to cause such uneasinesses very natural Judgment is chiefly shewn by opening the interesting complaint just at such a period of time as will give occasion  for the most tender sentiments and the most sudden and violent turns of passion to be displayed Ovid may perhaps be blamed for a sameness of subjects in these epistles of his heroines whose distresses are almost all occasioned by their lovers forsaking them His epistles are likewise too long which circumstance has forced him into a repetition and languor in the sentiments It would be a pleasing task and conduce to the formation of a good taste to shew how differently Ovid and the Greek tragedians have made Medea Phaedra and Deianira speak on the very same occasions Such a comparison would abundantly manifest the FANCY and WIT of Ovid and the JUDGMENT and NATURE of Euripides and Sophocles If the character of Medea was not better supported in the tragedy which Ovid is said to have produced and of which Quintilian speaks so advantageously than it is in her epistle to Jason one may venture to declare that if this drama had survived the Romans would not yet have been vindicated from their inferiority to the Greeks in tragic poesy  THE EPISTLE before us is translated by POPE with faithfulness and with elegance and much excells any that Dryden translated in the volume he published many of which were done by some  "of the mob of gentlemen that wrote with ease"  that is Sir C Scroop Caryl Pooly Wright Tate Buckingham Cooper and other careless rhymers A good translation of these epistles is as much wanted as one of Juvenal for out of sixteen satires of that poet Dryden himself translated but six We can now boast of happy translations in verse of almost all the great poets of antiquity whilst the French have been poorly contented with only prose translations of Homer and Horace which says Cervantes can no more resemble the original than the wrong side of tapestry can represent the right The inability of the French tongue to express many Greek or Roman ideas with facility and grace is here visible but the Italians have Horace translated by Pallavacini Theocritus by Ricolotti Ovid by Anguillara the Aeneid admirably well in blank verse by  Annibal Caro and the Georgics in blank verse also by Daniello  I return to Ovid by observing that he has put into the mouth of his heroine a greater number of pretty panegyrical epigrams than of those tender and passionate sentiments which suited her character and made her SENSIBILITY in amours so famous What can be more elegantly gallant than this compliment to Phaon  Sume fidem pharetram fies manifestus Apollo  Accedant capiti cornua Bacchus eris  This thought seems indisputably to have been imitated in that most justly celebrated of modern epigrams  Lumine Acon dextro capta est Leonilla sinistro  Et potis est forma vincere uterque Deos  Blande puer lumen quod habes concede sorori  Sic tu coecus AMOR sic erit illa VENUS  My chief reason for quoting these delicate lines was to point out the occasion of them which seems not to be sufficiently known  They were made on Louis de Maguiron the most beautiful man of his time and the great favourite of Henry III of France who lost an eye at the siege of Issoire and on the Princess of Eboli a great beauty but who was deprived of the sight of one of her eyes and who was at the same time mistress of Philip II King of Spain  IT was happily imagined to write an epistle in the character of Sapho who had spoken of the joys of love with more warmth and feeling than any writer of antiquity and who described the violent symptoms attending this passion in so strong and lively a manner that the physician Erasistratus is said to have discovered the secret malady of the Prince Antiochus who was in love with his motherinlaw Stratonice merely by examining the symptoms of his patient's distemper by this description Addison has inserted in two of his Spectators  N  o  and  an elegant character of this poetess and has given a translation of two of  her fragments that are exquisite in their kind a translation which we may presume Addison himself revised and altered for his friend Philips As these two pieces are pretty wellknown by being found in so popular a book as the Spectator I shall say no more of them but shall add two more of her fragments which though very short are yet highly beautiful and tender The first represents the languor and listlessness of a person deeply in love we may suppose the fair author looking up earnestly on her mother casting down the web on which she was employed and suddenly exclaiming  Dulcis mater non possum texere telum  Amore victa pueri per acrem Venerem  The other fragment is of the descriptive kind and seems to be the beginning of an Ode addressed  to EVENING it is quoted by Demetrius Phalereus  Edit Oxon p  Vesper omnia fers  Fers  um fers capram  Fers matri fi  am  From these little fragments the first of which is an example of the  pathetic  and the second of the  picturesque  the  manner  of Sappho might have been gathered if the two longer odes had not been preserved in the treatises of Dionysius and of Longinus I cannot help adopting the application Addison has made of his two lines of Phoedrus to these remains of our poetess which is perhaps one of the most elegant and happy applications that ever was made from any classic whatever  O suavis anima qualem te dicam bonam  Antehac fuisse tales cum sint reliquiae  Phaedr Fab L v  The versification of this translation of POPE is in point of melody next to that of his pastorals I am of opinion that the two following lines in which alliteration is successfully used are the most harmonious verses in our language I mean in rhyme  Ye gentle gales beneath my body blow  And softly lay me on the waves below  The peculiar musicalness of the first of these lines in particular arises principally from it's consisting entirely of iambic feet which have always a striking although unperceived effect in an English verse As for example  Yĕ gēntlĕ gāles bĕneāth my̆ bōdy̆ blōw  Even if the last foot alone be an iambic it casts a harmony over a whole line  See WARTON on Spenser Sect xi pag c  Rapt into future times the bard bĕgūn  There are many niceties in our versification which few attend to and which would demand  a regular treatise fully to discourse we should surely use every possible art to render our rough Northern language harmonious  FENTON also has given us a translation of this epistle to Phaon but it is in no respect equal to POPE's he has added another of his own invention of Phaon to Sappho in which the story of the transformation of the former from an old mariner to a beautiful youth is well told Fenton  POPE highly valued him In a letter to Gay Vol p he says  "I have just received the news of the death of a friend whom I esteemed almost as many years as you poor Fenton He died at Easthamstead of indolence and inactivity let it not be your fate but use exercise"  Craggs who had never received a learned education had some time before commissioned POPE to find out for him some polite scholar whom he proposed to take into his family that he might acquire a taste of literature by the conversation and instruction of the person POPE should recommend He accordingly chose Fenton but Craggs died unluckily for the execution of this scheme Mr Craggs had the candor to make no objection to Fenton tho he was a nonjuror being I presume convinced he was honest as well as learned  was an elegant scholar and had an exquisite taste the books he translated for POPE in the Odyssey are superior to Brome's In his Miscellanies are  some pieces worthy notice particularly his Epistle to Southerne the Fair Nun imitated from Fontaine Olivia a Character and an Ode to Lord Gower written in the true spirit of Lyric poetry of which the following allegory is an example  Enamour'd of the SEINE celestial fair  The blooming pride of Thetis azure train  Bacchus to win the nymph who caus'd his care  Lash'd his swift tigers to the celtic plain  There secret in her saphire cell  He with the Nais wont to dwell  Leaving the nectar'd feasts of Jove  And where her mazy waters flow  He gave the mantling vine to grow  A trophy to his love  His tragedy of Mariamne has merit tho the diction be too figurative and ornamental it does indeed superabound in the richest poetic images except this may be palliated by urging that it suits the characters of oriental heroes to talk in so high a strain and to use such a luxuriance of metaphors  FROM this EPISTLE of Sappho I may take occasion to observe that this species of writing beautiful as it is has not been much cultivated among us Drayton no despicable genius attempted to revive it and has left us some good subjects tho' not very artfully handled  The best of his ENGLAND's HEROICAL EPISTLES are King John to Matilda Elinor Cobham to Duke Humphry William De Le Poole to Queen Margaret Jane Shore to Edward IV Lord Surrey to Geraldine and Lady Jane Grey to Lord Gilford Dudley In his BARON's WARS there are many strokes not unworthy of Spenser and his Nymphidia must be allowed to be a perfect pattern of pastoral elegance  We have also a few of this sort of epistles by the late Lord Hervey in the fourth volume of Dodsley's Miscellanies  Page seq  Flora to Pompey Arisbe to Marius and Monimia to Philocles in which last are some pathetic strokes and Roxana to Usbeck taken from the incomparable  Lettres Persans A Geneve  letters of the late president Montesquieu a fine  Lady Wortley Montague who resided so long at Constantinople said  "One would have thought the Baron de Montesqieu had been born and bred a Turk he has described that people and the women particularly so very accurately""I had rather have written the short history of the Troglodites consisting only of ten pages than the admirable the immortal history of Thuanus in ten great volumes"  MES PENSEES ccxlv  original work  in which the customs and manners of the Persians are painted with the utmost truth and liveliness and which have been faintly imitated by the Jewish Chinese and other Letters The beauty of this writer is his expressive brevity which Lord Hervey has lengthened to a degree that is unnatural especially as Roxana is supposed to write just after she has swallowed a deadly poison and during it's violent operations I have lately seen several pieces of this species which as the subjects are striking will I hope one day see the light They are entitled  "TASSO to LEONORA written in an interval of his madness LUCAN to NERO just after he was condemned to death Lady OLIVIA to CLEMENTINA on her refusing to marry Grandison CHARLES V from the monastery he retired to to the King of France GALGACUS general of the Britons  to AGRICOLA that commanded the Romans MONTEZUMA to CORTEZ VITIKINDA the general of the Saxons to CHARLEMAYNE and ROSMUNDA to ALBOINUS King of the Lombards"  BUT of all stories ancient or modern there is not perhaps a more proper one to furnish out an elegiac epistle than that of ELOISA and ABELARD Their distresses were of a most SINGULAR and PECULIAR kind and their names sufficiently known but not grown trite or common by too frequent usage POPE was a most excellent IMPROVER if no great original INVENTOR for as we have seen what an elegant superstructure he has raised on the little dialogues of the Comte de Gabalis so shall we perceive in the sequel of this Section how finely he has worked up the hints of distress that are scattered up and down in Abelard's and Eloisa's Letters and in a

poetical performances insomuch that he was reputed to be the author of the famous Romance of the Rose which however was indisputably written by JOHN OF MEUN a little city on the banks of the Loire about four leagues from Orleans which gave occasion to Marot to exclaim  De Jean de Meun s'enfle le cours de Loire  Of this ancient French poet much more will be said in the course of this work when we come occasionally to speak of Chaucer suffice it at present to observe that he certainly continued and finished the Romance of the Rose which  Whom Marot praises as the Ennius of France  Notre Ennius Guillaume de Lorris  He took his name from the town of Lorris where he was born  William de Lorris had left imperfect forty years before If chronology did not absolutely contradict the notion of Abelard's being the author of this very celebrated piece yet are there internal arguments sufficient to confute it The mistake seems  to have flowed from his having given Eloisa the name of ROSE in one of the many sonnetts he addrest to her In this  Which was certainly written an hundred years after Abelard flourished  romance there are many severe and satirical strokes on the character of Eloisa which the pen of  Eloisa speaks thus of Abelard's poetry and skill also in music for he sung his own verses  "Duo autem fateor tibi specialiter inerant quibus foeminarum quarumlibet animos statim allicere poteras dictandi videlicet cantandi gratia Quae caeteros minimè philosophos assecutos esse novimus Quibus quidem quasi ludo quodam laborem exercitii recreans philosophici pleraque amatorio metro vel rithmo composita reliquisti carmina quae prae nimiâ suavitate tam dictaminis quam cantus saepius frequentata tuum in ore omnium nomen incessanter tenebant ut etiam illiteratos melodiae dulcedo tui non sineret esse immemores  Epist Heloissae p Edit  It is observable that POPE judiciously softened and harmonized her name to  Eloisa  from  Heloissa  Abelard never would have given In one passage she is introduced speaking with indecency and obscenity in another all the vices and bad qualities of women are represented as assembled together in her alone  Qui les maeurs feminins savoit  Car trestous en soi les avoit  In a very old epistle dedicatory addressed to  Philip the fourth of France by this same John of Meun and prefixed to a French translation of Boetius a very popular book at that time it appears that he also translated the epistles of Abelard to Heloisa which were in high vogue at the court He mentions also that he had translated Vegetius on the Art Military and a book called the Wonders of Ireland these works shew us the taste of the age his words are  "t'envoye ores  Chaucer also translated this pieceBoetius was a most admired classic of that age indeed he deserves to be so of any  Boece de consolation que j'ai translaté en Francois jacoit que bien entendes le Latin"  This sentence strongly also characterises the times    It is to be regretted that we have no exact picture of the person and beauty of Eloisa Abelard himself says that she was  "facie non infima"  her extraordinary learning many circumstances concur to confirm particularly one which is that the nuns of the Paraclete are wont to have the office of Whitsunday read to them in Greek to perpetuate  the memory of her understanding that language The curious may not be displeased to be informed that the Paraclete was built in the parish of Quincey upon the little river Arduzon near to Nogent upon the Seine Happening to be in France a few years ago I had the curiosity to visit the very spot which I surveyed with much veneration A lady learned as was Eloisa in that age who indisputably understood the latin greek and hebrew tongues was a kind of prodigy her literature says  Abel Opera p  Abelard  "in toto regno nominatissimam fecerat"  and we may be sure more thoroughly attached him to her Bussy Rabutin speaks in high terms of commendation of the purity of Eloisa's latinity a judgment worthy a French count There is a force but not an elegance in her style which is blemished as might be expected by many phrases unknown to the pure ages of the Roman language and by many Hebraisms borrowed from the translation of the bible  I now propose to pass through the  The compliment which Prior paid our author on this EPISTLE is at once full of elegance and very lively imagery He addresses it to Abelard and says that POPE has  wove  A silken web and ne'er shall fade  Its colours gently he has laid  The mantle o'er thy sad distress  And Venus shall the texture bless  He o'er the weeping Nun has drawn  Such artful folds of sacred lawn  That LOVE with equal grief and pride  Shall see the crime he strives to hide  And softly drawing back the veil  The god shall to his vot'ries tell  Each conscious tear each blushing grace  That deck'd dear Eloisa's face  ALMA p  EPISTLE in order to give the reader a view of the various turns and tumults of passion and the different sentiments with which Eloisa is agitated and at the same time to point out what passages are borrowed and how much improved from the original Letters From this analysis her struggles and conflicts between duty and pleasure between penitence and passion will more amply and strikingly appear  SHE begins with declaring how the peacefulness of her situation has been disturbed by a letter of her lover accidentally falling into her hands this exordium is beautiful being worked up with an awakening solemnity she looks about her and breaks out at once  V  In these deep solitudes and awful cells  "If I was ordered to find out the most happy and the most miserable man in the World I would look for them in a cloister"  said a man of penetration  Where heavenlypensive CONTEMPLATION dwells  And evermusing MELANCHOLY reigns  What means this tumult in a vestal's veins  Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat  Why feels my heart it's longforgotten heat  She then resolves neither to mention or to write the name of Abelard but suddenly adds in a dramatic manner  V    Quanto rectius HOC quàm tristi laedere versû  Pantolabum scurram Nomentanumque nepotem  Hor Sat L S  The name appears  Already writtenwash it out my tears  She then addresses herself to the convent where she was confined in fine imagery  V  Relentless walls whose darksom round contains  Repentant sighs and voluntary pains  This and several other circumstances in the scenery view of the monastery which denote antiquity may perhaps be a little blamed on account of their impropriety when introduced into a place so lately founded as was the Paraclete but are so well imagined and highly painted that they demand excuse  Ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn  Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn  Shrines where their vigils paleey'd virgins keep  And pitying saints whose statues learn to weep  Tho' cold like you unmov'd and silent grown  I have not yet forgot myself to stone  "Forget myself to marble"  is an expression of Milton as is also  "Caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn"  and the epithets  "paleeyed and twilight"  are first used in the smaller poems of Milton which POPE had just perhaps been reading  She proceeds to enumerate the effects which Abelard's relation of their misfortunes has had upon her yet notwithstanding what she suffers from them she intreats him still to write  V  Yet write O write me all that I may join  Griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine  This is from the Letters  "Per ipsum itaque Christum obsecramus quatenus ancillulas ipsius tuas crebris literis de his in quibus adhuc fluctuas naufragiis certificare  Ep p  digneris ut nos saltem quae tibi solae remansimus doloris vel gaudii participes habeas"  On the mention of letters she breaks out into that beautiful account of their use which is finely improved from the latin  V  Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid  Some banish'd lover or some captive maid  They live they speak they breathe what love inspires  Warm from the soul and faithful to it's fires  It is to be hoped that some of the fair sex of the abilities of Eloisa for we have two or three such at present in Great Britain will answer the ingenious but paradoxical philosopher of Geneva who has vented many blasphemies against the passion of love  "Il faut distinguer says he le MORAL du  physique  dans le sentiment de l'amour Le  physique  est ce desir general qui porte une sexe a s'unir a l'autre Le  moral  est ce qui determine ce desir le fixe sur un seul object exclusivement ou qui du moins lui donne pour cet objet preferè un plus grand degrè d'energie Or il est facile de voir que le moral de l'amour est un sentiment factice nè de l'usage de la societie celebrè par les femmes avec beaucoup d'habilitè de soin pour etablir leur empire rendre dominant le sexe qui devroit obeir"  DISCOURS sur L'origine de l'INEGALITE parmi les hommesPar J J Rousseau Amsterdam pag  It is not to be wondered at that he who has written a satire against human society should satirize its greatest blessing  The virgins wish without her blush impart  Excuse the blush and pour out all the heart  "De quibuscunque autem nobis scribas non parvum nobis remedium conferes hoc saltem uno quod te nostri memorem esse monstrabis"  She then quotes  Epist p  an unnecessary passage of Seneca and adds  "Si imagines nobis amicorum absentium jucundae sunt quae memoriam renovant desiderium absentiae falso atque inani solatio levant quanto jucundiores sunt literae quae amici absentis veras notas afferunt"  The origin of Eloisa's passion is with much art and knowledge of human nature ascribed to her admiration of her handsome preceptor this circumstance is particularly poetical and even sublime  V  My fancy form'd thee of the angelic kind  Some emanation of th' allbeauteous mind  V  How  These thoughts have furnished Bayle with an occasion to discuss after his manner whether the pleasures of love are most exquisitely enjoyed with a mistress or a wife Vol I Dict p  "Abundat dulcibus vitiis"  is the character of this work of Bayle  oft when press'd to marriage have I said  Curse on all laws but those which love has made  Let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame  August her deed and sacred be her fame  Before true passion all these views remove  Fame wealth and honour what are you to love  These sentiments are plainly from the letters  "Nihil unquam deus scit in te nisi te requisivi te purè non tua concupiscens Non matrimonii foedera non dotes aliquas expectavi Et si uxoris nomen sanctius ac validius videtur dulcius mihi semper extitit amicae vocabulum aut si non indigneris concubinae vel scorti"  POPE has added a very injudicious thought  V  The jealous God when we profane his fires  Those restless passions in revenge inspires  And again  V  Love free as air at fight of human ties  Spreads his light wings and in a moment flies  It is improper for a person in the situation of Eloisa to mention Cupid mythology is here out of its place The Letters also furnished the next thought  V  Not Caesar's empress would I deign to prove  No make me mistress of the man I love  "DEUM testem invoco si me Augustus universo praesidens mundo matrimonii honore dignaretur totumque mihi orbem confirmaret in perpetuo praesidendum charius mihi dignius videretur tua dici meretrix quam illius imperatrix"  Next she describes their unparallelled happiness in the full and free enjoyment of their loves but all at once stops short and reclaims with eagerness as if she at that instant saw the dreadful scene alluded to  V  Alass how chang'd what sudden horrors rise  A naked lover bound and bleeding lies  Where where was Eloise her voice her hand  Her ponyard had oppos'd the dire command  Barbarian stay  that  bloody stroke restrain  The crime was common common be the pain  It was difficult to speak of this catastrophe that befel Abelard with any dignity and grace our poet however has done it I know not where castration is the chief cause of distress in any other poem except in a very extraordinary one of Catullus where Atys struck with madness by Berecynthia in a fit of enthusiasm inflicts this punishment on himself After which he laments his condition in very pathetic strains The poem has been so little remarked on that I shall take the liberty of inserting the following passage in the speech of Atys which is very dramatic full of spirit and sudden changes of passion  Egone a meâ remota haec ferar in memora domo  Patriâ bonis amicis genitoribus abero  Abero foro palestrâ stadio gymnasiis  Miser ah miser querendum est etiam atque etiam anime  Quod enim genus figura est ego numquid abierim  Ego mulierego adolescens ego ephebus ego puer  Ego gymnasii fui flos ego eram decus olei  Mihi januae frequentes mihi limina tepida  Mihi floridis corollis redimita domus erat  Linquendum ubi esset orto mihi sole cubiculum  Egone deum ministra Cybeles famula ferar  Egone maenas ego mei pars ego vir sterilis ero  Ego viridis algida Idae nive amicta loca colam  Ego vitam agam sub altis Phrygiae columinibus  Ubi cerva sylvicultrix ubi aper nemorivagus  Jam jam dolet quod egi jam jam quoque paenitet  This whole poem being of a strain superiour to any thing in the Roman poesy and more passionate and sublime than any part of Virgil and being also so much above the tender and elegant genius of Catullus whose name it bears inclines me to think it a translation from some Grecian writer and perhaps if the reader will peruse the whole it will give him the truest notion of an old dithyrambic of any poem antiquity has left us The text is in some places much corrupted but enough remains pure and intelligible to place it at the head of latin poetry how strangely soever it has been neglected It ought to be observed that the seventh eighth and ninth lines of this quotation bear a wonderful resemblance to a fine passage in the book of Job Ch Ver seq  One knows not which most to applaud the lively imagery the pathetic or the artful decency with which this trasaction is delicately hinted at in these most excellent lines which are the genuine voice of nature and passion and place the object intended to be imprest on the reader full in his sight  SHE next reminds Abelard of the solemnity of her taking the veil from verse one hundred and six to one hundred and eighty four which are highly beautiful particularly these circumstances attending the rite  V  As with  cold  lips I kiss'd the sacred veil  The shrines all  trembled  and the lamps  grew pale  These two circumstances are fancied with equal force and propriety and this supposed prognostic of the uneasiness she would undergo in the monastic life is very affecting But her passion intruded itself even in the midst of this awful act of devotion the strength of which she represents by this particular  V  Yet then to these dread altars as I drew  Not on the  Cross  my eyes were fix'd but  You  Here she gives her fondness leave to expatiate into many luscious ideas  V  Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie  Still drink delicious poison from thy eye  Pant on thy lip and to thy heart be prest  And then follows a line exquisitely passionate and worthy the  sensibility  of Sappho or of Eloisa  Give all thou  canst  and let me dream the  rest  Suddenly she here checks the torrent of this amorous transport  V  Ah noinstruct me other joys to prize  With other beauties charm my partial eyes  Full in my view set all the bright abode  And make my soul quit Abelard for God  She puts him in mind of his being the father and founder of the monastery and entreats him to visit his flock on that account This topic is taken from the Letters  V  From the false world in early youth they fled  By thee to mountains wilds and desarts led  You rais'd these hallow'd walls the desart smil'd  And paradise was open'd in the wild  "Nihil hic super alienum aedificâsti fundamentum totum quod hic est tua creatio est Solitudo haec feris tantum sive latronibus vacans nullam hominum habitationem noverat nullam domum habuerat In ipsis cubilibus ferarum in ipsis latibulis latronum ubi nec nominari deus solet divinum erexisti tabernaculum spiritûs sancti proprium dedicâsti templum Nihil ad hoc aedificandum  ex regum vel principum opibus intulisti cum plurima posses maxima ut quicquid fieret tibi soli posset ascribi"  Which last sentence is finely improved by POPE being at once heightened with pathos and poetic imagery and containing an oblique satire on benefactions raised by avarice or extorted by fear  V  No weeping orphan saw his father's stores  Our shrines irradiate or emblaze our floors  No silver saints by dying misers giv'n  Here brib'd the rage of illrequited heav'n  But such plain roofs as piety could raise  NO part of this poem or indeed of any of POPE's productions is so truly poetical and contains such strong painting as the passage to which we are now arrivedThe description of the convent where POPE's religion certainly aided his fancy It is impossible to read it without being struck with a pensive pleasure and a sacred awe at the solemnity of the scene so picturesque are the epithets  V  In these  lone  walls their days eternal bound  These  mossgrown  domes with  spiry  turrets crown'd  Where  awful  arches make a noonday night  And the  dim  windows shed a  solemn  light  Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray  All the circumstances that can amuse and sooth the mind of a solitary are next enumerated in this expressive manner and the reader that shall be disgusted at the length of the quotation I pronounce has no taste either for painting or poetry  V  The darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd  Wave high and murmur to the hollow wind  The wand'ring streams that shine between the hills  The grots that echo to the tinckling rills  The dying gales that pant upon the trees  The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze  No more these scenes my meditation aid  Or lull to rest the visionary maid  The effect and influence of MELANCHOLY who is beautifully personified on every object that occurs and on every part of the convent cannot be too much applauded or  too often read as it is founded on nature and experience That temper of mind casts a gloom on all things  V  But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves  Longsounding iles and intermingled graves  Black MELANCHOLY sits and round her throws  A deathlike silence and a dread repose  Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene  Shades every flower and darkens every green  Deepens the murmur of the falling floods  And breathes a browner horror on the woods  The figurative expressions  throws  and  breathes  and  browner  horror are I verily believe the strongest and boldest in the English language The IMAGE of the Goddess MELANCHOLY sitting over the convent and as it were expanding her dreadful wings over its whole circuit and diffusing her gloom all around it is truely sublime and strongly conceived  ELOISA proceeds to give an account of the opposite sentiments that divide and disturb her soul these are hinted in the Letters also  V  Ah wretch believ'd the spouse of God in vain  Confess'd within the slave of love and man  I ought to grieve but cannot what I ought  I mourn the lover not lament the fault  This however is improved greatly on the original  "Castam me praedicant qui non deprehendunt hypocritamQuomodo paenitentia peccatorum quantacunque sit corporis afflictio si mens adhuc ipsam peccandi retinet voluntatem pristinis aestuat desideriis"  Epist p  She then fondly calls on Abelard for assistance  V  O come O teach me nature to subdue  Renounce my love my life myself andyou  Till my fond heart win God alone for he  Alone can rival can succeed to thee  Fired with this idea of religion she takes occasion to dwell on the happiness of a BLAMELESS vestal one who has no such sin on her conscience as she has to bemoan The life of such an one is described at length by such  sorts  of pleasure as none but a spotless nun  can partake of the climax of her happiness is finely conducted  V  For her the SPOUSE prepares the bridal ring  For her white virgins hymeneals sing  For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms  And wings of Seraphs shed divine persumes  To sounds of heavenly harps she dies away  And melts in visions of eternal day  What a judicious and poetical use hath POPE here made of the opinions of the mystics and quietists how would Fenelon have been delighted with these lines True poetry after all cannot well subsist at least is never so striking without a tincture of enthufiasm the sudden transition has a fine effect  V  Far other dreams my erring soul employ  Far other raptures of unholy joy  Which raptures are painted with much sensibility and in very animating colours  "Nec etiam dormienti suis illusionibus parcunt"  Ep p    Again  V  Oh curst dear horrors of allconscious night  How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight  This is very forceibly expressed She proceeds to recount a dream in which I was always heavily disappointed because the imagined distress is such as might attend the dreams of any person whatever  It is partly from Dido's dream  V  Methinks we wandring go  Thro dreary wastes and weep each other's woe  Where round some mouldring tow'r pale ivy creeps  And low brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps  Sudden you mount you beckon from the skies  Clouds interpose c  These are indisputably picturesque lines but what I want is a VISION of some such appropriated and peculiar distress as could be incident to none but Eloisa and which should be drawn from and have reference to her single story What distinguishes Homer and Shakespear from all other poets is that they do not give their readers GENERAL ideas every image is the particular and unalienable property of the person who uses it it is suited to no other it is made for him or her alone  Even Virgil himself is not free from this fault but is frequently general and indiscriminating where Homer is minutely circumstantial She next compares his situation with her own  V  For thee the fates severely kind ordain  A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain  Thy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose  The four fimiles that follow drawn from religion are admirable  No pulse that riots and no blood that glows  Here Eloisa glances with great modesty and delicacy at the irreparable misfortune of her mutilated husband which however she always mentions with regret I question whether it may be improper to alleviate the dryness of these critical remarks with the following story which I wish had fallen into the hands of Fontaine  "The Greeks waged war upon the duke of Benevento and made him very uneasy Thedbald Marquis of Spoleto his ally marching to his assistance and having taken some prisoners ordered them to be  castrated and in that condition sent them back to the Greek general with orders to tell him that he had done it to oblige the emperor whom he knew to be a lover of eunuchs and that he would endeavour to send him in a short time a much greater number of them The Marquis was preparing to be as good as his word when one day a woman whose husband had been taken prisoner came all in tears to the camp and begged to speak to Thedbald The Marquis having asked her the cause of her grief my Lord says she I wonder that such a valiant hero as you should trifle away your time in warring with women when men are unable to resist you Thedbald replied that since the days of the Amazons he had never heard that war had been made upon women My Lord answered the Greek woman can a crueller be made upon us than to deprive our husbands of what gives us health pleasure and children When you make eunuchs of them it is mutilating us not them you have lately taken away our cattle and goods without any complaint  from me but this being an irreparable loss to several of my neighbours I could not avoid imploring the compassion of the conqueror The whole army was so pleased with this woman's ingenuous declaration that they restored her husband to her and all they had taken from her As she was going away Thedbald asked her what she would be willing should be done to her husband if he was found in arms again He has eyes said she a nose hands and feet these are his OWN which you may take from HIM if he deserves it but leave him if you please what belongs to ME"  Bibliotheque Universelle Tom p  A HINT in the Letters has been beautifully heightened and elevated into exquisite poetry in the next paragraph Eloisa says only  "Inter ipsa missarum solemnia ubi purior esse debeat oratio obscoena earum voluptatum phantasmata its sibi penitus miserrimam captivant animam ut turpitudinibus illis magis quam orationi vacem Nec solum quae egimus  sed loca pariter tempora"  Let us see how this has been improved  V  What scenes appear where'er I turn my view  The dear ideas where I fly pursue  Rise in the grove before the altar rise  Then follows a circumstance peculiarly tender and proper as it refers to a particular excellence of Abelard  V  THY VOICE I seem in every hymn to hear  With every bead I drop too soft a tear  To which succeeds that sublime description of a high mass which came from the poet's soul and is very striking  V  When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll  And swelling organs lift the rising soul  One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight  Priests tapers temples swim before my sight  In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd  While altars blaze and angels tremble round  I BELIEVE few persons have ever been present at the celebrating a mass in a good choir  but have been extremely affected with awe if not with devotion which ought to put us on our guard against the insinuating nature of so pompous and alluring a religion as popery Lord Bolingbroke being one day present at this solemnity in the chapel at Versailles and seeing the archbishop of Paris elevate the host whispered his companion the Marquis de *****  "If I were king of France I would always perform this ceremony myself"  ELOISA now acknowledges the weakness of her religious efforts and gives herself up to the prevalence of her passion  V  Come with one glance of those deluding eyes  Blot out each bright idea of the skies  Take back that grace that sorrow and these tears  Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs  Snatch me just mounting from the blest abode  Assist the fiends and tear me from my God  Suddenly religion rushes back on her mind and she exclaims eagerly  V  No fly me fly me far as pole to pole  Ah  come  not  write  not  think  not once of me  Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee  Thy oaths I quit thy memory resign  Forget renounce me hate whate'er was mine  This change is judicious and moving And the following invocation to hope faith and christian grace to come and take full possession of her soul is solemn and suited to the condition of her mind for it seems to be the poet's intention to shew the force of religion over passion at last and to represent her as a little calm and resigned to her destiny and way of life To fix her in which holy temper the circumstance that follows may be supposed to contribute For she relates an incident to Abelard which had made a very deep impression on her mind and cannot fail of making an equal one on the mind of those readers who can relish true poetry and strong imagery The scene she paints is awful she represents herself lying on a tomb  and thinking she heard some  V  spirit calling to her in every low wind  Virgil may however have given the hintHinc exaudiri voces verba vocantis visa viriL  Here as I watch'd the dying lamps around  From yonder shrine I heard a hollow found  Come sister come if said or seem'd to say  Thy place is here sad sister come away  Once like thyself I trembled wept and pray'd  It is well contrived that this invisible speaker should be a person that had been under the very same kind of misfortunes with Eloisa  Love's victim then but now a sainted maid  This scene would make a fine subject for the pencil and is worthy a capital painter He might place Eloisa in the long ile of a great Gothic church a lamp should hang over her head whose dim and dismal ray should afford only light enough to make darkness visible She herself should be represented in the  instant  when she first hears this aërial voice and in the attitude of  starting round  with astonishment and fear And this was the  method a very great master took  to paint a sound  if I may be allowed the expression This subject was the baptism of Jesus Christ and in order to bring into this subject the remarkable incident of the voice from heaven which cried aloud  "This is my beloved son"  he represented all the assembly that attended on the banks of Jordan gazing up into heaven with the utmost ardor of amazement  AT this call of a sister in misfortune who had been visited with a sad similitude of griefs with her own Eloisa breaks out in a religious transport  I come I come prepare your roseate bow'rs  Coelestial palms and everblooming flow'rs  Thither where  sinners  may have rest I go  She then calls on Abelard to pay her the last sad offices and to be present with her in the article of death  See my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll  And then a circumstance of personal fondness intervenes  Suck  my last breath and catch the flying soul  But she instantly corrects herself and would have her Abelard attend her at these last solemn moments only as a devout priest and not as a fond lover The image in which she represents him coming to administer extreme unction is striking and picturesque  Ah noin sacred vest  nts mayst thou stand  The hallow'd taper  The words printed in Italics ought to be looked on as particularly beautiful  trembling  in thy hand  Present  the cross before my  lifted  eye  Teach me at once and learn of me to die  She adds that it will be  some  consolation to behold him once more tho' even in the agonies of death  Ah then thy oncelov'd Eloisa see  It will be  then  no crime to  gaze  on me  Which last line I could never read without great emotion it is at once so pathetic and so artfully points back to the whole train and nature of their misfortunes The circumstances  she wishes may attend the death of Abelard are poetically imagined and are also agreeable to the notions of mystic devotion The death of St Jerome is finely painted by DOMENICHINO with such attendant particulars  V  In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd  Bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round  From opening skies may streaming glories shine  And saints embrace thee with a love like mine  May one kind grave unite each hapless name  And graft my love immortal on thy fame  This wish was fulfilled The body of Abelard who died twenty years before Eloisa was sent to Eloisa who interred it in the monastery of the Paraclete and it was accompanied with a very extraordinary form of Absolution from the famous Peter de Clugny  "Ego Petrus Cluniacensis abbas qui Petrum Abelardum in monachum Cluniacensem recepi corpus ejus furtim delatum Heloissae Abbatissae monialibus Paracleti concessi  auctoritate omnipotentis Dei omnium sanctorum absolvo eum suo officio ab omnibus peccatis suis"    "Eloisa herself says  Melanges T p  Vigneul Marville sollicited for this absolution and Peter de Clugny willingly granted it on what it could be founded I leave to our learned theologists to determine In certain ages opinions have prevailed for which no solid reason can be given"  When Eloisa died in she was interred by the side of her beloved husband I must not forget to mention for the sake of those who are fond of miracles that when she was put into the grave Abelard stretched out his arms to receive her and closely embraced her  ELOISA at the conclusion of the EPISTLE to which we are now arrived is judiciously represented as gradually settling into a tranquillity of mind and seemingly reconciled to her fate She can bear to speak of their being buried together without violent emotions Two lovers are introduced as visiting their celebrated  tombs and the behaviour of these strangers is finely imagined  V  From the full quire when loud Hosannas rise  And swell the pomp of  dreadful  sacrifice  Amid that scene if some relenting eye  Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie  Devotion's self shall steal a thought from heav'n  One human tear shall dropand be forgiv'n  With this line in my opinion the poem should have ended for the eight additional ones concerning some poet that haply might arise to sing their misfortunes are languid and flat and diminish the pathos of the foregoing sentiments They might stand for the conclusion of almost any story  THIS EPISTLE is on the whole one of the most highly finished and certainly the most interesting of the pieces of our author and together with the ELEGY to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady is the only instance of the Pathetic POPE has given us I think  one may venture to remark that the reputation of POPE as a poet among posterity will be principally owing to his WINDSORFOREST his RAPE OF THE LOCK and his ELOISA TO ABELARD whilst the facts and characters alluded to and exposed in his later writings will be forgotten and unknown and their poignancy and propriety little relished For WIT and SATIRE are transitory and perishable but NATURE and PASSION are eternal  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
