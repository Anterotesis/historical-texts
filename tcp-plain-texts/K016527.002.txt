 THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON IN A SERIES of LETTERS Published from the ORIGINALS By the Editor of PAMELA and CLARISSA  In SEVEN VOLUMES  VOL II  LONDON  Printed by S RICHARDSON AND  DUBLIN  Reprinted and sold by the Booksellers M DCC LIII  THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON Bart  LETTER I Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  LUCY SELBY  Wedn Night March  _MR Fowler set out yesterday for Gloucestershire where he has an estate He proposes to go from thence to Caermarthen to the worthy Sir Rowland He paid a visit to Mr Reeves and desir'd him to present to me his best wishes and respects He declar'd that he could not possibly take leave of me though he doubted not but I would receive him with goodness as he called it But it was  that  which cut him to the heart So kind and so cruel he said he could not bear it  I hope poor Mr Fowler will be more happy than I could make him Methinks I could have been  halfglad to have seen him before he went and yet  but  halfglad for had he shewn much concern I should have been pained  Take now my dear an account of what passed this day at St James's Square  There were at Sir Charles Grandison's besides Lord and Lady L the young Lord G one of Miss Grandison's humble Servants Mr Everard Grandison Miss Emily Jervois a young Lady of about fourteen a ward of Sir Charles and Dr Bartlett a Divine of whom more byandby  Sir Charles conducted us into the drawingroom adjoining to the diningroom where only were his two sisters They received my cousins and me with looks of Love  I will tell you said Sir Charles your company before I present them to you Lord L is a good man I honour him as such and love him as my sister's Husband  Lady L bowed and looked round her as if she took pride in her brother's approbation of her Lord  Mr Everard Grandison proceeded he is a sprightly man He is prepared to admire you Miss Byron  You  will not believe perhaps half the handsome things he will say to you but yet will be the only person who hears them that will not  Lord G is a modest young man He is genteel wellbred but is so much in Love with a certain young Lady that he does not appear with that dignity in her eye Why blushes my Charlotte that otherwise perhaps he might  Are not  you  Sir Charles a  modest  man  No comparisons Charlotte Where there is a double prepossession no comparisonsBut Lord G Miss Byron is a good kind of young man You'll not dislike him though my sister is pleased to think  No comparisons Sir Charles  That's fair Charlotte I will leave Lord G to the  judgment of Miss Byron Ladies can better account for the approbation and dislikes of Ladies than we Men can  Dr Bartlett you'll also see He is learned prudent humble You'll read his heart in his countenance the moment he smiles upon you Your grandpapa madam had fine curling silver hair had he not The moment I heard that you owed obligation to your grandfather's care and delight in you I figured to myself that he was just such a man habit excepted Your grandfather was not a Clergyman I think When I have friends whom I have a strong desire to please I always endeavour to treat them with Dr Bartlett's company He has but one fault he speaks too little But were he to speak much every one else would  wish  to be silent  My ward Emily Jervois is an amiable girl Her father was a good man but not happy in his nuptials He bequeathed to my care on his deathbed at Florence this his only child My sister loves her I love her for her own sake as well as for her father's She has a great fortune And I have had the happiness to recover large sums which her father gave over for lost He was an Italian merchant and driven out of England by the unhappy temper of his wife I have had some trouble with her and if she be living expect more  Unhappy temper of his wife  Sir Charles You are very mild in your account of one of the most abandoned of women  Well but Charlotte I am only giving brief hints of Emily's story to procure for her an interest in Miss Byron's favour and to make their first acquaintance easy to each other Emily wants no prepossession in Miss Byron's favour She will be very ready herself to tell her whole story to Miss Byron Meantime let us not say all that is just to say of the  Mother  when we are speaking of the  Daughter  I stand corrected Sir Charles  Emily madam turning to me is not constantly resident with us in town She is fond of being everywhere with my Charlotte  And where  you  are Sir Charles said Miss Grandison  Mr Reeves whispered a question to Sir Charles which was seconded by my eyes for I guessed what it was Whether he had heard any thing further of Sir Hargrave  Don't be anxious said Sir Charles All must be well People long used to error don't without reluctance submit to new methods of proceeding All must be well  Sir Charles stepping out brought in with him Miss Jervois The Gentlemen seem engaged in conversation said he But I know the impatience of this young Lady to pay her respects to Miss Byron  He presented her to us This dear girl is my Emily Allow me madam whenever Miss Grandison shall be absent to claim for her the benefit of your instruction and your general countenance as she shall appear worthy of it  There are not many men my Lucy who can make a compliment to one Lady without robbing or at least depreciating another How often have you and I observed that a polite brother is a black swan  I saluted the young Lady and told her I should be fond of embracing every opportunity that should offer to commend myself to her favour  Miss Emily Jervois is a lovely girl She is tall genteel and has a fine complexion and tho' pitted with the smallpox is pretty The sweetness of her manners as expressed in her aspect gives her great advantage I was sure the moment I saw her that her greatest delight is to please  She made me two or three pretty compliments  and had  not  Sir Charles commended her to me I should have been highly taken with her  Mr Grandison entered Upon my honour Sir Charles I can stay no longer said he To know that the finest woman in England is under the same  oof with me yet to be so long detained from paying my respects to herI can't bear it And in a very gallant manner as he seemed to  intend  he paid his compliments first to me and then to my two cousinsAnd whispering yet loud enough to be heard to Miss Grandison swore by his soul that report fell short of my perfectionsand I can't tell what  Did I not tell you that you would say so Sir said Miss Grandison  I did not like the gentleman the better for what I had heard of him But perhaps should have been less indifferent to his compliment had I not before been acquainted with Mr Greville Mr Fenwick and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen The men of this cast I think seem all alike Poor creatures how from my heartBut indeed now that I have the honour to know these two sisters I despise  myself  Sir Charles addressing himself to my cousins and me Now said he that my cousin Grandison has found an opportunity to introduce himself and that I have presented my ward to you we will if you please see how Lord L Lord G and Dr Bartlett are engaged  He led my cousin Reeves into the diningroom  Lord L addressed us with great politeness  After Sir Charles had presented the Doctor to my cousins he respectfully took my hand Were there fifty Ladies here my good Dr Bartlett whom you had never seen before you would I am sure from the character you have had of Miss Byron be under no difficulty of reading that character in this young Lady's Face Miss Byron behold in Dr Bartlett another grandfather  I reverence said I good Dr Bartlett I borrow Sir Charles's thought The character he has given you Sir is stamped in your countenance I should have venerated you whereever I had seen you  The gentleman has such a truly venerable aspect my Lucy I could not help saying this  Sir Charles's goodness madam said he as it ever did prevents my wishes I rejoice to see and to congratulate a new sister  restored  as I will call it in the language of Miss Grandison to the best of families  Just then came in a servant and whispered to Sir Charles Shew the gentleman said Sir Charles into the drawingroom next the study  Mr Grandison came up to me and said many silly things I thought them so at that time  Mr Reeves soon after was sent for out by Sir Charles I did not like his looks on his return  Dinner being ready to be served and Sir Charles who was still with the gentleman summoned to it he desir'd we would walk down and he would wait upon us by the time we were seated  Some new trouble thought I of which I am the cause I doubt  Presently came in Sir Charles unaffectedly smiling and sereneGod bless you Sir thought IHis looks pleased me better than my cousin's  But my dear there is something going forward that I cannot get out of my cousin I hoped I should when I got home The Gentleman to whom Sir Charles was called out was certainly that Bagenhall Mr Reeves cannot deny that I guessed it was by Sir Charles's sending in for Mr Reeves It must be about me  We had several charming conversations Sir Charles was extremely entertaining So unassuming so lively so modest it was delightful to see the attention paid to him by the servants as they waited at table  They watched every look of his I never saw love and reverence so agreeably mingled in servants faces in my life And his commands were delivered to them with so much gentleness of voice and aspect that one could not but conclude in favour of both that they were the best of Servants to the best of Masters  Mr Grandison was very gallant in his speeches to me but very uncivil with his eyes  Lord L said but little but what he did say deservedly gained attention  Everybody reverenced Dr Bartlett and was attentive when he spoke and would I dare say on his own account had not the Master of the house by the regard he paid him engaged every one's veneration for him Many of the questions which Sir Charles put to him as if to inform himself it was evident he could himself have answered Yet he put them with an air of  teachableness  if I may so express myself and received the Doctor's answers to them with as much satisfaction as if he were then newly enlightened by themAh my Lucy you imagine I dare say that this admirable man lost nothing in my eyes by this his polite condescension Reserve and a politeness that had dignity in it shewed that the fine Gentleman and the Clergyman were not separated in Dr BartlettPity they should be in any of the function  Sir Charles gave Lord G an opportunity to shine by leading the discourse into circumstances and details which Lord G could best recount My Lord has been a traveller He is a connoisseur in Antiquities and in those parts of  nice  Knowlege as I a woman call it with which the Royal Society here and the learned and polite of other nations entertain themselves  Lord G appeared to advantage as Sir Charles managed it under the awful eye of Miss Grandison Upon my word Lucy she makes very free with him I whisper'd her that she didA very Miss How said I  To a  very  Mr Hickman rewhispered sheBut here's the difference I am not determined to have Lord G Miss How yielded to her mother's recommendation and intended to marry Mr Hickman even when she used him worst One time or other archly continued she the whisper holding up her spread Hand and with a countenance of admiration my Lord G is to shew us his collection of Butterflies and other gaudy insects Will you make one  Of the gaudy insects whispered I  Fie HarrietOne of the party you know I must mean Let me tell you I never saw a collection of these various insects that I did not the more admire the Maker of them and of all us insects whatever I thought of the collectors of the minute onesAnother word with you HarrietThese little playful studies may do well enough with persons who do not want to be  more  than indifferent to us But do you think a Lover ought to take high delight in the painted wings of a Butterfly when a fine Lady has made herself all over Butterfly to attract himEyes off Sir Charlesfor he looked tho' smilingly yet earnestly at us as we whisper'd behind the Countess's chair who heard what was said and was pleased with it  LETTER II Miss  BYRON  In continuation  Thursday Morning Mar  I Should have told you that Miss Grandison did the honours of the table and I will go round it for I know you expect I should But I have not yet done with Lord GPoor man he is excessively in Love I see that Well he may What man would not with Miss Grandison Yet is she too superior I think  What can a woman do who is addressed by a man of talents inferior to her own Must she throw away her talents Must she hide her light under a bushel purely to do credit to the man She cannot pick and choose as men can She has only her negative and if she is desirous to oblige her friends not always  that  Yet it is said Women must not encourage Fops and Fools They must encourage Men of Sense only And it is  well  said But what will they do if their lot be cast only among Foplings If the Men of Sense do not offer themselves And pray may I not ask if the taste of the age among the men is not Dress Equipage and Foppery Is the cultivation of the mind any part of their study The men in short are sunk my dear and the women but barely swim  Lord G seems a little too finical in his dress And yet I am told that Sir Walter Watkyns outdoes him in Foppery What can they mean by it when Sir Charles Grandison is before them  He  scruples not to modernize a little but then you see that it is in compliance with the fashion and to avoid singularity a sault to which great minds are perhaps too often subject tho'  he  is so much above it  I want to know methinks whether Sir Charles is  very  much in earnest in his favour to Lord G with regard to Miss Grandison I doubt not if he be but he has good reasons for it  Were this vile Sir Hargrave out of my head I could satisfy myself about twenty and twenty things that nowandthen I want to know  Miss Jervois behaved very discreetly With what pleasure did she hang on every word that fell from the lips of her guardian I thought more than once of Swift's Cadenus and Vanessa Poor girl how I should pity her were she insensibly to suffer her gratitude to lead her to be in Love with her benefactor Indeed I pity everybody who is hopelesly in Love  Now don't you shake your head my uncle Did I not  always pity Mr Orme and Mr FowlerYou know I did Lucy  Miss Jervois had a smile ready for every one but it was not an implicit a childish smile It had distinction in it and shewed intelligence Upon the whole she said little and heard all that was said with attention And hence I pronounce her a very discreet young Lady  But I thought to have done with the  Men  first and here is Mr Grandison hardly mentioned who yet in his own opinion was not the last of the men at table  Mr Grandison is a man of middling stature not handsome in my eyes but so near being handsome that he may be excused when one knows him for thinking himself so because he is liable to make greater mistakes than that  He dresses very gaily too He is at the  head  of the fashion as it seems he thinks but however is one of the  first  in it be it what it will He is a great frequenter of the drawingroom of all manner of publick spectacles a leader of the taste at a new Play or Opera He dances he sings he laughs and values himself on all three qualifications And yet certainly has sense but is not likely to improve it much since he seems to be so much afraid of suffering in the consequence he thinks himself of that whenever Sir Charles applies himself to him upon any of his levities tho' but by the eye his consciousness however mild the look makes him shew an uneasiness at the instant He reddens sits in pain calls for favour by his eyes and his quivering lips and has notwithstanding a smile ready to turn into a laugh in order to lessen his own sensibilty should he be likely to suffer in the opinion of the company But every motion shews his consciousness of inferiority to the man of whose smiles or animadversions he is so very apprehensive  What a captious what a supercilious husband to a woman who should happen to have a stronger mind than his would Mr Grandison make But he values himself upon his having preserved his liberty  I believe there are more bachelors now in England by many thousands than were a few years ago And probably the numbers of them and of single women of course will every year increase The luxury of the age will account a good deal for this and the turn our Sex take in  un  domesticating themselves for a good deal more But let not these worthy young women who may think themselves destined to a single life repine overmuch at their lot since possibly if they have had no Lovers or having had one two or three have not found an husband they have had rather a miss than a loss as men go And let me here add that I think as matters stand in this age or indeed ever did stand that those women who have joined with the men in their insolent ridicule of Old Maids ought never to be forgiven No tho' Miss Grandison should be one of the ridiculers An Old Maid  may be  an odious character if they will tell us that the bad qualities of the persons not the maiden State are what they mean to expose But then they must allow that there are Old Maids of Twenty and even that there are Widows and Wives of all ages and complexions who in the abusive sense of the words are as much Old Maids as the most particular of that class of females  But a word or two more concerning Mr Grandison  He is about Thirtytwo He has had the  glory  of ruining two or three women Sir Charles has  restored  him to a sense of shame All men I hope are born with it which a sew months ago he had got above And he does not now entertain ladies with instances of the frailty of individuals of their Sex which many are too apt encouragingly to  smile at when I am very much mistaken if every woman would not find her account if she wishes  herself  to be thought well of in discouraging every reflection that may have a tendency to debase or expose the Sex in general How can a man be suffered to boast of his vileness to one woman in the presence of another without a rebuke that should put it to the proof whether the boaster was or was not past blushing  Mr Grandison is thought to have hurt his fortune which was very considerable by his free living and an itch of gaming to cure him of which Sir Charles encourages him to give him his company at all opportunities He certainly has understanding enough to know how to value the favour for he owns to Miss Grandison that he both loves and fears him and nowandthen tells her that he would give the world if he had it to be able to be just what Sir Charles is Good God at other times he has broke out What an odious creature is a Rake How I hate myself when I contemplate the excellencies of this divine Brother of yours  I shall say nothing of Sir Charles in this place You I know my Lucy will admire me for my forbearance  Lady L and Miss Grandison were the Graces of the Table So lively so sensible so frank so polite so goodhumour'd what honour do they and their Brother reflect back on the memory of their mother Lady Grandison it seems was an excellent woman Sir Thomas was not I have heard quite unexceptionable How useful if so are the women in the greater as well as in the lesser parts of domestic duty where they  perform  their duty And what have those who do not to answer for to GOD to their Children and even to their whole Sex for the contempts they bring upon it by their uselesness and  perhaps extravagance since if the human mind is not actively good it will generally be actively evil  Dr Bartlett I have already spoken of How did he enliven the conversation whenever he bore a part in it So happy an elocution so clear so just so solid his reasoning I wish I could remember every word he said  Sir Charles observed to us before we saw him that he was not forward to speak But as I hinted he threw the occasions in his way on purpose to draw him out And at such times what he said was easy free and unaffected And whenever a subject was concluded he had done with it His modesty in short made him always follow rather than lead a subject as he very well might do be it what it would  I was charmed with the Brachman's prayer which he occasionally gave us on the antient Persians being talked of  Looking up to the rising Sun which it was supposed they worshipped these were the words of the Brachman  "O THOU meaning the ALMIGHTY by whom  Thou  meaning the Sun art enlightened illuminate my mind that my actions may be agreeable to THY Will"  And this I will think of my Lucy as often as my early hour for the future shall be irradiated by that glorious orb  Everybody was pleased with Mr and Mrs Reeves Their modesty good sense and amiable tempers and the kind yet not ostentatious regard which they express to each other a regard so creditable to the married state cause them to be always treated and spoken of with distinction  But I believe as I am in a scribling vein I must give you the particulars of one conversation in which farther honour was done to Dr Bartlett  After dinner the Countess drawing me on one side by both my hands said well our other sister our newfound sister let me know how you like us I am in pain lest you should not love us as well as you do  our  Northamptonshire relations  You overcome me madam with your goodness  Miss Grandison then coming towards us Dear Miss Grandison said I help me to words  No indeed I'll help you to nothing I am jealous Lady L don't think to rob me of my Harriet's preferable Love as you have of Sir Charles's I  will  be best sister here But what was your subjectYet I will answer my own question Some pretty compliment I suppose Women to women Women hunger and thirst aster compliments Rather than be without them if no men are at hand to flatter us we love to say handsome things to one another and so teach the men to find us out  You need not be  jealous  Charlotte said the Countess You may be  sure  This saucy girl Miss Byron is ever frustrating her own pretensions Can flattery Charlotte say what we will have place  here  But tell me Miss Byron how you like Dr Bartlett  Ay tell us Harriet said Miss Grandison how you like Dr Bartlett Pray Lady L don't anticipate me I propose to give our new sister the history of us all And is not Dr Bartlett one of  us  She has already given me the history of all her friends and of herself And I have communicated to you like a good sister all she has told me  I considered Dr Bartlett I said as a Saint and at the same time as a man of true politeness  He is indeed said the Countess all that is worthy and amiable in man Don't you see how Sir Charles admires him  Pray Lady L keep clear of my province Here is Sir Charles He will not let us break into parties  Sir Charles heard this last sentenceYet I wonder  not said he joining us that three such women get together Goodness to goodness is a natural attraction We men however will not be excludedDr Bartlett if you please  The Doctor approached in a most graceful mannerLet me again Miss Byron present Dr Bartlett to you as a man that is an honour to his cloth and that is the same thing as if I said to human nature The good man bowed in silence and Miss Byron to you my good Doctor taking my hand as a Lady most worthy your distinguished regard  You do me too much honour Sir said I I shall hope good Doctor Bartlett by your instructions to be enabled to deserve such a recommendation  My dear Harriet said the Countess snatching my other hand you are a  good  girl and that is more to your honour than Beauty  Be quiet Lady L said Miss Grandison  Mr Grandison came upWhat Is there not another hand for me  I was vexed at his interruption It prevented Dr Bartlett from saying something that his lips were opening to speak with a smile of benignity  How the World said Sir Charles smiling will push itself in  Heart  not  Hand  my dear Mr Grandison was the subject  Whenever You Sir Charles and the Doctor and these Ladies are got together I know I  must  be unseasonable But if you exclude me such company how shall I ever be what you and the Doctor would have me to be  Lord L and Lord G were coming up to us See your attraction Miss Byron said the Countess  But joined in Miss Grandison we will not leave our little Jervois by herself expecting and longingOur Cousins Reevesonly that when they are together they cannot want companyshould not be thus  left Is there more than one heart among usThis Man's excepted humourously pushing Mr Grandison as if from the companyLet us be orderly and take our seats  How cruel is this said Mr Grandison appealing to Sir Charles  Indeed I think it is a little cruel Charlotte  Not so Let him be good thenTill when may all our Sex say to such men as my cousin has been  "Thus let it be done by the man whom if he were good good persons would delight to honour"  Shame if not principle said Lord L smiling would effect the cure if all Ladies were to act thus Don't you think so cousin Everard  Well well said Mr Grandison I will be good as fast as I can But Doctor what say youRome was not built in a day  I have great hopes of Mr Grandison said the Doctor But Ladies you must not as Mr Grandison observed exclude from the benefit of your conversation the man whom you wish to be good  What not till he  is  good said Miss Grandison Did I not say We should delight to honour him when he was  But what Sir Charles come I had rather take my cue from you than anybody what are the signs which I am to give to be allowed  Only these my cousinWhen you can be serious on serious subjects yet so chearful in your seriousness as if it sat easy upon you when you can at times prefer the company and conversation of Dr Bartlett who is not a solemn or severe man to any other and in general had rather stand well in his opinion than in that of the gayest man or woman in the world  Provided yours Sir Charles may be added to the Doctor's  Command me Mr Grandison whenever you two are together We will not oppress you with our subjects  Our conversation shall be that of Men of  chearful  Men You shall lead them and change them at pleasure The first moment and I will watch for it that I shall imagine you to be tired or uneasy I will break off the conversation and you shall leave us and pursue your own diversions without a question  You were always indulgent to me Sir Charles said Mr Grandison and I have retired and blushed to myself sometimes for  wanting  your indulgence  Tea was preparing Sir Charles took his own seat next Lord L whom he set in to talk of Scotland He enjoyed the account my Lord gave of the pleasure which the Countess on that her first journey into those parts gave to all  his  family and friends as Lady L on her part acknowleged she had a grateful sense of  their  goodness to her  I rejoice said Sir Charles that the sea divides us not from such worthy people as you my Lord have given us a relation to Next visit you make Charlotte I hope will accompany me I intend to make one in your train as I have told your Lordship before  You will add to our pleasure Sir Charles All my relations are prepared to do you honour  But my Lord did not the Ladies think a little hardly of your Lordship's engagement that a man of your merit should go from Scotland for a wife I do assure you my Lord that in all the countries I have been in I never saw finer women than I have seen in Scotland and in very few nations tho' six times as large greater numbers of them  I  was  to be the happiest of men Sir Charles in a GrandisonI thank  you  bowing  It is one of my felicities my Lord that my sister calls herself yours  Lady L whispering me as I sat between her and Miss Grand son The two worthiest hearts in the world Miss Byron my Lord L's and my brother's  With joy I congratulate your Ladyship on both rewhispered I May God long continue to you two such blessings  I thought of the vile Sir Hargrave at the time  I can tell you how said Mr Grandison to repay that nationYou Sir Charles shall go down and bring up with a you Scotish Lady  I was vexed with myself for starting I could not help it  Don't you think Lucy that Sir Charles made a very fine compliment to the Scotish LadiesI own that I have heard the women of our Northern counties praised  also  But are there not think you as pretty women in England  My Sister Harriet applied Sir Charles to me you need not I hope be told that I am a great admirer of fine women  I had like to have bowedI should not have been able to recover myself had I so seemed to apply his compliment  I the less wonder that you are Sir Charles because in the word  fine  you include mind as well as person  That's my good girl said Miss Grandison as she poured out the tea and so he does  My dear Charlotte whisper'd Ipray say something encouraging to Lord G He is pleased with everybody but nobody says anything to him and he I see both loves and fears you  Hush child whispered she again The man's best when he is silent If it be his day to  love  it is his day to  fear  What a duce shall a woman's time be Never  That's good news for my Lord Shall I hint to him that his time  will  come  Do if you dare I want you to provoke me She spoke aloud  I have done said I  My Lord what do you think Miss Byron says  For Heaven's sake dear Miss Grandison  Nay I will speak it  Pray madam let me know said my Lord  You will know Miss Grandison in time said Sir Charles I trust her not with any of  my  secrets Miss Byron  The more ungenerous you Sir Charles for you get out of me all mine I complained of you Sir to Miss Byron for your reserves at Colnbrooke  Be so good madam said my Lord  Nay nothing but the Mountain and the Mouse Miss Byron only wanted to see your collection of insects  Miss Byron will do me great honour  If Charlotte won't attend you madam said the Countess to my Lord G's I will  Have I not brought you off Harriet whispered Miss GrandisonTrust me another timeShe will let you know the day before my Lord  Miss Grandison my Lord said I loves to alarm But I will with pleasure wait on  her  and on the Countess whenever they please  You will see many things worth your notice madam in Lord G's collection said Sir Charles to me But Charlotte thinks nothing less than men and women worthy of her notice her parrot and squirrel the one for its prattle the other for its vivacity excepted  Thank you Sir CharlesBut pray do  you  be quiet I fear nobody else  Miss Byron said the Countess pray spare her not I see you can make Charlotte afraid of  two  Then it must be of  three  Lady LYou know my reverence for my elder sister  No no but I don't I know only that nobody can better tell what she  should  do than my Charlotte  But I have always taken too much delight in your vivacity either to wish or expect you to rein it in  You acted by me like an  indolent  parent Lady L who miscalls herself  indulgent  You gave me my head for your own pleasure and when I had got it tho' you found the inconvenience you chose rather to bear it than to take the pains to restrain meBut Sir Charles whatever faults he might have had when he was from us came over to us finished He grew not up with us from year to year His blaze dazled me and I have tried over and over but cannot yet get the better of my reverence for  him  If I have not my sister's love rather than what she pleasantly calls her reverence I shall have a much worse opinion of my own outward behaviour than of her merit  Your outward behaviour Sir Charles cannot be in fault said Lord L But I join with my sister Charlotte in her opinion of what  is  And I too said the Countessfor I am a partyThis is it Sir CharlesWho that lies under obligations which they cannot return can view the obliger but with the most delicate sensibilities  Give  me  leave said Miss Emily her face crimsoned over with modest gratitude to say that I am one that shall ever have a reverence superior to my love for the best of guardians  Blushes overspread my face and gave a tacit acknowledgment on my part of the same sensibility from the same motives  Who is it joined in Dr Bartlett that knows my patron but must acknowlege  My dear Dr Bartlett interrupted Sir Charles from you and from my good Lord L these fine things are not to be borne From my three sisters looking at  me  for one and from my dear ward I cannot be so uneasy when they will not be restrained from acknowledging  that I have succeeded in my endeavours to perform my  duty  to them  I long to know as I said once before the particulars of what Sir Charles has done to oblige everybody in so high a manner Don't  you  Lucy Bless me what a deal of time have I wasted since I came to town I feel as if I had wings and had soared to so great an height that every thing and person that I before behold without dissatisfaction in this great town looks diminutive and little under my aking eye Thus my dear it must be in a better world if we are permitted to look back upon the  highest  of our satisfactions in this  I was asked to give them a lesson on the harpsichord after tea Miss Grandison said Come come to prevent all excuses I will shew you the way  Let it then be said Mr Grandison Shakespear's Cuckow You have made me enter with so much comparative shame into myself that I must have something lively to raise my spirits  Well so it shall replied Miss Grandison Our poor cousin does not know what to do with himself when you are got a little out of his reach  That is not fair Charlotte said Sir Charles It is not that graceful manner of obliging in which you generally excel Compliance and Reflection are not to be coupled  Well well but I will give the good man his Cuckow to make him amends  Accordingly she sung that ballad from Shakespear and with so much spirit and humour as delighted everybody  Sir Charles being a judge of musick I looked a little sillier than common when I was again called upon  Come my dear said the kind Countess I will prepare you a little further When you see your two elder sisters go before you you will have more courage  She sat down and play'd one of Scarlatti's lessons which you know are made to shew a fine hand And surely for the swiftness of her fingers and the elegance of her manner she could not be equalled  It is referred to you my third Sister said Sir Charles who had been taken aside by Mr Reeves some whispering talk having passed between them to favour us with some of Handel's musick Mrs Reeves says she has heard you sing several songs out of the Pastoral and out of some of his finest Oratorios  Come hither come hither my sweet HarrietHere's his Alexander's Feast My brother admires that I know and says it is the noblest composition that ever was produced by man and is as finely set as written  She made me sit down to the instrument  As you know said I that great part of the beauty of this performance arises from the proper transitions from one different strain to another any one song must lose greatly by being taken out of its place and I fear  Fear nothing Miss Byron said Sir Charles Your obligingness as well as your observation intitle you to all allowances  I then turned to that fine piece of accompanied recitative  Softly sweet in Lydian measures  Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures  Which not being set so full with accompanying symphonies as most of Mr Handel's are I performed with the more ease to myself tho' I had never but once before play'd it over  They all with more compliments than I dare repeat requested me to play and sing it once more  Dare repeat  methinks I hear my uncle Selby say The girl that does nothing else but repeat her own praises comes with her  If I dare repeat  Yes Sir I answer for compliments that do not elevate that do not touch me run glibly off my pen But such as  indeed  raise one's vanity how can one  avow  that vanity by writing them downBut they were resolved to be pleased before I began  One compliment however from Sir Charles I cannot I find pass over in silence He whispered Miss Grandison as he leaned upon my chair How could Sir Hargrave Pollexfen have the heart to endeavour to stop such a mouth as that  AND now having last night and this morning written so many sides it is time to break off Yet I could give you many more particulars of agreeable conversation that passed were I sure you would not think me insufferably tedious and did not the unkind reserve of my cousin Reeves as to the business of that Bagenhall rush upon my memory with fresh force and help to tire my fingers I am the more concerned as my cousin himself seems not easy but is in expectation of hearing something that will either give him relief or add to his pain  Why Lucy should our friends take upon themselves to keep us in the dark as to those matters which it concerns us more to know than perhaps anybody else There is a tenderness sometimes shewn on arduous occasions in this respect that gives as much pain as we could receive from the most explicit communication And then all the while there is so much strength of mind and discretion supposed in the person that knows an event and such weakness in her that is to be kept in ignorance thatBut I grow as saucy as impatient Let me conclude before I expose my self to reproof for a petulance that I hope is not natural to  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER III Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  LUCY SELBY  Thursday Night Mar  AND what do you think was the reason of Mr Reeves's reserves A most alarming one I am obliged to him that he kept it from me tho' the uncertainty did not a little affect me Take the account of it as it comes out  I told you in my former that the person to whom Sir Charles was sent for out was Mr Bagenhall and that Sir Charles had sent in for Mr Reeves who returned to the company with a countenance that I did not like so well as I did Sir Charles's I now proceed to give you from Minutes of Mr Reeves what passed on the occasion  Sir Charles took Mr Reeves asideThis unhappy man Sir Hargrave I mean said he seems to me to want an excuse to himself for putting up with a treatment which he thinks disgraceful When we have to deal with children humours must be a little allowed for But you'll hear what the proposal is now Let not the Ladies however nor the Gentlemen within know any thing of the matter till all is over This is a day devoted to pleasure But  you  Mr Reeves know something of the matter and can answer for your fair cousin  He then led Mr Reeves in to Mr Bagenhall  This Sir is Mr ReevesSir Hargrave in short Mr Reeves among other demands that I cannot comply with but which relate only to myself and therefore need not be mentioned insists upon an introduction to Miss Byron He says she is absolutely disengagedIs she Sir  I dare say she is answered my cousin  This gentleman has been naming to me Mr Greville Mr Orme and others  No one of them has ever met with the shadow of encouragement from my cousin She is above keeping any man in suspense when she is not in any herself Nothing has given her more uneasiness than the number of her Admirers  Miss Byron said Sir Charles  must  be admired by every one that beholds her but still more by those who are admitted to the honour of conversing with her But Sir Hargrave is willing to build upon her disengagement something in his own favour Is there any room for Sir Hargrave who pleads his sufferings for her who vows his honourable intentions even at the time that he was hoping to gain her by so unmanly a violence and appeals to her for the purity as he calls it of his behaviour to her all the time she was in his handswho makes very large offers of settlementsis there any room to hope that Miss Byron  No none at all Sir Charles  What not to save a life Mr Reevessaid Mr Bagenhall  If you mean mine Mr Bagenhall replied Sir Charles I beg that that may not be considered If Sir Hargrave means his own I will pronounce that safe from any premeditated resentment of mine Do you think Miss Byron will bear to see Sir Hargrave Mr Reeves I presume he intends to beg pardon of her Will she consent to receive a visit from himBut is not this wretched trisling Mr Bagenhall  You will remember Sir Charles this is a proposal of  mine  what I  hoped  might be agreed to by Sir Hargrave but that I was willing to consult you before I mentioned it to him  I beg your pardon Mr Bagenhall I now remember it  If ever man doated upon a woman said Mr Bagenhall  it is Sir Hargrave on Miss Byron The very methods he took to obtain her for a wife shew that most convincinglyYou will promise not to stand in his way Sir  I repeat Mr Bagenhall what I have heretofore told you That Miss Byron You'll excuse me Mr Reeves is still under my protection If Sir Hargrave as he ought is inclin'd to ask her pardon and if he can obtain it and even upon his own terms I shall think Miss Byron and he may be happier together than at present I can imagine it possible I am not desirous to be anyway considered but as her protector from violence and insult and that I will be if she claim it in defiance of an hundred such men as Sir Hargrave But then Sir the occasion must be sudden No legal relief must be at hand I will not either for an adversary's sake or my own be defied into a cool and premeditated vengeance  But Sir Charles Sir Hargrave has some hardships in this case You will not give him the satisfaction of a Gentleman And according to the Laws of Honour a man is not intitled to be  treated  as a Gentleman who denies to one  Of whose making Mr Bagenhall are the Laws of Honour you mention I own no Laws but the Laws of GOD and my Country But to cut this matter short tell Sir Hargrave that little as is the dependence a Man of Honour can have upon that of a man who has acted by an helpless woman as he has acted by Miss Byron I will breakfast with him in his own house tomorrow morning if he contradicts it not I will attribute to the violence of his passion for the Lady the unmanly outrage he was guilty of I will suppose him mistaken enough to imagine that he should make her amends by marriage if he could compel her hand and will trust my person to his honour one servant only to walk before his door not to enter the house to attend my commands after our  conversation is over My sword and my sword only shall be my companion But this rather that I would not be thought to owe my safety to the want of it than in expectation after such confidence placed in him to have occasion to draw it in my own defence And pray Mr Bagenhall do you his friend be present and any other friends and to what number he pleases  When I came to this place in my cousin's Minutes I was astonished I was out of breath upon it  Mr Bagenhall was surprised and asked Sir Charles if he were in earnest  I would not be thought a rash man Mr Bagenhall Sir Hargrave  threatens  me I never avoid a threatener  You  seem to hint Sir that I am not intitled to fair play if I consent not to meet him with a murderous intention With such an intention I never will meet any man though I have as much reason to rely on the skill of my arm as on the justice of my cause If foul play is hinted at I am no more safe from an assassin in my bedchamber than in Sir Hargrave's house Something must be done by a man who refuses a challenge to let a challenger see such is the world such is the custom that he has  better  motives than fear for his refusal I will put Sir Hargrave's Honour to the fullest test Tell him Sir that I will bear a great deal but that I will not be insulted were he a Prince  And you really would have me  I would Mr Bagenhall Sir Hargrave I see will not be satisfied unless something extraordinary be done And if I hear not from you or from him I will attend him by ten tomorrow morning in an amicable manner to breakfast at his own house in Cavendish Square  I am in terror Lucy even in transcribing only  Mr Reeves said Sir Charles you undo me if one word of this matter escape you even to your wife  Mr Reeves begged that he might attend him to Sir Hargrave's  By no means Mr Reeves  Then Sir Charles you apprehend danger  I do  not  Something as I said must be done This is the shortest and best method to make all parties easy Sir Hargrave thinks himself slighted He may infer if he pleases in his own favour that I do  not  despise a man in whom I can place such a confidence Do you Mr Reeves return to company and let no one know the occasion of your absence or of mine from it  I have told you my dear what a difference there was in the countenances of both when each separately entered the diningroom And could this great man surely I may call him  great  could he in  such  circumstances on his return give joy pleasure entertainment to all the company without the least cause of suspicion of what had passed  Mr Reeves as I told you singled out Sir Charles in the evening to know what had passed after he left him and Mr Bagenhall Sir Charles acquainted him that Mr Bagenhall had proposed to let him know that night or in the morning how Sir Hargrave approved of his intended visit He has accordingly signified to me already said Sir Charles that Sir Hargrave expects me  And will you go Sir  Don't give yourself concern about the matter Mr Reeves All must end well My intention is not to run into mischief but to prevent it My principles are better known abroad than they are in England I have been challenged more than once by men who knew them and thought to find their safety from them I have been obliged to take some extraordinary steps to save myself from insult and those steps have answered my end in more licentious countries  than this I hope this step will preserve me from calls of this nature in my own country  For God's sake Sir Charles  Be not uneasy on my account Mr Reeves Does not Sir Hargrave value himself upon his fortune He would be loth to forfeit it  His  fortune is  my  security And am I not a man of some consequence myself Is not the affair between us known will not therefore the cause justify me and condemn him The man is turbulent he is uneasy with himself he knows himself to be in the wrong And shall a man who resolves to pay a sacred regard to laws divine and human fear this Goth 'Tis time enough to fear when I can be unjust If you value my friendship as I do yours my good Mr Reeves proceeded he I shall be sure of your absolute silence I will attend Sir Hargrave by ten tomorrow morning You will hear from me or see me at your own house by twelve  And then it was as Mr Reeves tells me that Sir Charles turned from him to encourage me to give the company a lesson from Dryden's Alexander's Feast as set by Handel which I chose to be in the lines  Softly sweet  c  Mr Reeves went out in the morning My cousin says he had been excessively uneasy all night He now owns he called at St James's Square and there breakfasted with Lord and Lady L Miss Grandison Miss Emily and Dr Bartlett Sir Charles went out at nine in a chair one servant only attending him The family knew not whither And his two sisters were fomenting a rebellion against him as they humourously called it for his keeping from them who kept nothing from  him  his motions when they and my Lord were together and at his house But my Lord and Miss Emily pleasantly refused to join in it Mr Reeves told us on his return that his heart was so sunk that they took great notice of his dejection  About three o'clock just as Mr Reeves was determined  to go to St James's Square again and if Sir Charles had not been heard of to CavendishSquare tho' irresolute what to do when there the following billet was brought him from Sir Charles After what I have written does not your heart leap for joy my Lucy  Half an hour after two  Dear Sir  I Will do myself the honour of visiting Mr Reeves Miss Byron and you at your usual teatime if you are not engaged I tell the Ladies here that those who have least to do are generally the most busy people in the world I can therefore be only answerable on this visit for Sir  Your most humble Servant CHARLES GRANDISON  Then it was that vehemently urged both by my cousin and me Mr Reeves gave us briefly the cause of his uneasiness  About six o' clock Sir Charles came in a chair He was charmingly dressed I thought him the moment he enter'd the handsomest man I ever saw in my life What a transporting thing must it be my Lucy to an affectionate wife without restraint without check and performing nothing but her duty to run with open arms to receive a worthy husband returning to her after a long absence or from an escaped danger How cold how joylessBut no I was neither cold nor joyless for my face as I felt it was in a glow and my heart was ready to burst with congratulatory meaning at the visible safety and unhurt person of the man who had laid me before under such obligations to him as were too much for my gratitude O do not do not tell me my dear friends that  you  love him that  you  wish me to be his I shall be ready if you  do  to wishI don't know what I would say But  your  wishes were always the leaders of  mine  Mrs Reeves having the same cause for apprehension could hardly restrain herself when he entered the room She met him at the door her hand held out and with so much emotion that Sir Charles said How well Mr Reeves you have kept my secretMr Reeves told him what an uneasiness he had laboured under from the preceding evening and how silent he had been till his welcome billet came  Then it was that both my cousins with equal freedom congratulated him  And I'll tell you how the Fool the maiden Fool looked and acted Her feet insensibly moved to meet him while he was receiving the freer compliments of my cousins I courtesied bashfully it was hardly noticeable and  because  unnoticed I paid my compliments in a deeper courtesy And then finding my hand in his when I knew not whether I had an hand or notI am grieved Sir sad I to be the occasion to be the causeAnd I sighed for one reason perhaps you can guess what that was and blushed for two because I knew not what to say nor how to look and because I was under obligations which I could not return  He kindly saved my further confusion by making light of what had passed And leading me to a seat took his place by me  May I ask Sir Charlessaid my cousin Reeves and stopt  The conversation was too tedious and too various to be minutely related Mr Reeves But Sir Hargrave had by Mr Bagenhall's desire got his shorthand writer in a closet and that unknown to me till all was over I am to have a copy of what passed You shall see it if you please when it is sent me Mean time what think you of a compromise at  your  expence Miss Byron  I dare abide by every thing that Sir Charles Grandison has stipulated for me  It would be cruelty to keep a Lady in suspence where doubt will give her pain and cannot end in pleasure Sir Hargrave is resolv'd to wait upon you Are you willing to see him  If Sir you would advise me to see him  I advise nothing Madam Pursue your inclinations Mr Reeves is at liberty to admit whom he pleases into his House Miss Byron to see in it or wheresoever she is whom  she  pleases I told him my mind very freely But I left him determined to wait on you I have reason to believe he will behave very well I should be surprised if he does not in the humblest manner ask your pardon and  yours  Mr Reeves and your Lady's But if you have any apprehensions Madam to me I will be ready to attend you at five minutes notice before he shall be admitted to your presence  It is very good Sir said Mr Reeves to be ready to favour Miss Byron with your countenance on such an occasion But I hope we need not give you that trouble in this house  Sir Charles went away soon after and Mr Reeves has been accusing himself ever since with answering him too abruptly tho' he meant nothing but the truest respect And yet as I have written it on reperusal I don't above half like Mr Reeves's answer But where high respect is entertained grateful hearts will always I believe be accusing themselves of imperfections which none other see or can charge them with  As Sir Charles is safe and I have now nothing to apprehend but Sir Hargrave's visit I will dispatch this Letter with assurances that I am my dear Lucy  Your everaffectionate HARRIET BYRON  LETTER IV Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  LUCY SELBY  Friday One o'Clock Mar  SIR Charles had just sent the impatiently expected Paper transcribed by the shorthand writer from his minutes of the conversation that passed on Sir Charles's intrepid visit at Sir Hargrave's  Intrepid  I call it But had I known of it as Mr Reeves did before the event in some measure justified the  rashness  I should have called it rash and been for proposing to send Peaceofficers to CavendishSquare or taking some method to know whether he were safe in his person especially when three o'clock approached and his dinnertime is earlier than that of most other people of fashion  Mr Reeves has been so good as to undertake to transcribe this long paper for me that I may have time to give you an account of three particular visits which I have received I asked Mr Reeves If it were not a strange way of proceeding in this Bagenhall to have his shorthand writer and now turned listener always with him He answered It was not a usual way but in cases of this nature where murder and a tryal were expected to follow the rashness in a court of justice he thought it carried with it tho' a face of premeditation yet a look of fairness and there was no doubt but the man had been in bad scrapes before now and was willing to use every precaution for the future  The PAPER  On Thursday morning March the d I Henry Cotes according to notice given me the preceding evening went to the house of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen Baronet in Cavendish Square about half an hour after eight in the morning in order to take  minutes in shorthand of a conversation that was expected to be held between the said Sir Hargrave Pollexfen and Sir Charles Grandison Baronet upon a debate between the said Gentlemen on which I had once before attended James Bagenhall Esquire at the House of the said Sir Charles Grandison in St James Square and from which consequences were apprehended that might make an exact account of what passed of great importance  I was admitted about nine o'clock into the withdrawingroom where were present the said Sir Hargrave the said James Bagenhall Solomon Merceda Esquire and John Jordan Esquire And they were in full conversation about the reception that was to be given to the said Sir Charles Grandison which not being a part of my orders or business I had no command to take down but the  contrary  And that I might with the less interruption take minutes of the expected conversation I was ordered to place myself in a large closet adjoining to the said withdrawingroom from which it was separated by a thin wainscotpartition But lest the said Sir Charles should object to the taking of the said minutes I was directed to conceal myself there till called forth but to take the said minutes fairly and truly as upon occasion I would make oath to the truth thereof  About half an hour after nine o'clock I heard Mr Bagenhall with an oath that denoted by the voice eagerness and surprize say Sir Charles was come And immediately a footman enter'd and said  "Sir Charles Grandison"  Then three or four of the Gentlemen spoke together pretty loud and high But what they said I thought not in my orders to note down But this is not improper to note Sir Hargrave said Give me that pair of pistols and let him follow me into the garden By Ghe shall take  one  No no I heard Mr Merceda say who being a foreigner I knew his voice from the restNo no That must not be  And another voice I believe by the lisp it was Mr Jordan's say Let us Sir Hargrave hear what a man so gallant has to say for himself  Occasions  may arise  afterwards  Mr Bagenhall whose voice I well knew said Dn his blood if an hair of Sir Charles Grandison's head should be hurt on this visit  Do I dn ye all said Sir Hargrave offer any thing unfair when I would give him the choice of the pistols  What in your own garden A pretty story whichsoever drops said Mr Merceda The devil's in it if he may not be  forced  now to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman elsewhere  Desire Sir Charles Dn his blood said Sir Hargrave to come in And then as I saw through a knothole that I just then hunting for a crack in the wainscotpartition discovered Sir Charles entered and I saw that he looked very sedate and chearful and he had his sword by his side though in a morning dress And then the conversation began as follows  Sir Charles  YOUR Servant Sir Hargrave Mr Bagenhall yours Your Servant Gentlemen  Mr Bagenhall  Yours Sir Charles You are a man of your word This gentleman is Mr Jordan Sir Charles This gentleman is Mr Merceda  Sir Ch  Mr MercedaI have heard of Mr MercedaI have been very free Sir Hargrave to invite myself to breakfast with you  Sir Hargrave  Yes by G And so you have before now Have you anybody with you SirIf you have let them walk in  Sir Ch  Nobody Sir  Sir Har  These are gentlemen Sir They are men of honour They are  my  friends  Sir Ch  They look like gentlemen I suppose every man a man of honour till I find him otherwise  Sir Har  But don't think I have them here to intimidate  Sir Ch  Intimidate Sir Hargrave I know not what it is to be intimidated You say the gentlemen are your friends I come with a view to increase and not diminish the number of your friends  Sir Har  "Increase the number of my friends"What with one who robbed me of the only woman on earth that is worth having And who but for the unmanly advantage taken of me had been my wife before the day was over Sir And yet to resuse me the satisfaction of a gentleman SirBut I hope you are now come  Sir Ch  To breakfast with you Sir HargraveDon't be warm I am determined if possible not to be provokedBut I must not be illtreated  Sir Har  Why then Sir take one of those two pistols My chariot shall carry us  Sir Ch  Nowhere Sir Hargrave What has hitherto passed between us was owing to accident It is not my way to recriminate To your own heart however I appeal That must convince you that the method you took to gain the Lady rendered you unworthy of her I took no  unmanly  advantage of you That I refused to meet you in the way you have demanded gives me a title to call myself your best friend  Sir Har  "My best friend" Sir  Sir Ch  Yes Sir If either the preservation of your own life or the saving you a long regret for takeing that of another as the chance might have been deserves your consideration In short it depends upon yourself Sir Hargrave to let me know whether  you were guilty of a bad action from mad and violent passion or from design and a natural byass if I may so call it to violence which alone can lead you to think of justifying one bad action by another  Sir Har  Then Sir account me a man of  natural violence  if you please Who shall value the opinion of a man that has disgracefullyGd'dyou SirDo you seewhat marks I shall carry to my grave  Sir Ch  Were I as violent as you Sir Hargrave you might carry those marks to your grave and not wear them longLet us breakfast Sir That will give you time to cool Were I even to do as you would have me you will best find your account in being cool You cannot think I would take such an advantage of you as your passion would give me  Mr Bag  Nobly said by HeavenLet us breakfast Sir Hargrave Then you will be cooler Then will you be fitter to discuss this point or any other  Mr Merceda  Very right You have a noble enemy Sir Hargrave  Sir Ch  I am no man's enemy Mr Merceda Sir Hargrave should consider that in the occasion for all this he was to blame and that all my part in the affair was owing to accident not malice  Mr Jordan  I doubt not Sir Charles but you are ready to ask pardon of Sir Hargrave for your part  Sir Ch  Ask pardon SirNoI think I ought to have done just as I did Were it to do again I should do it whoever were the man  Sir Har  See there See thereMr Bagenhall Mr Merceda Mr Jordan See there Hear thatWho can have patience  Sir Ch  I can tell you who  ought  to have patience Sir Hargrave I should have a very mean opinion of any man here called upon as I was if he had not done just as I did And a still meaner than I have of  you  Sir Hargrave had you in the like case refused  the same assistance to a woman in distress But I will not repeat what I have written  Sir Har  If you are a  man  Sir Charles Grandison take your choice of one of those pistols Gdn you I insist upon it  And I saw thro' the knothole that Sir Hargrave arose in passion  Sir Ch  As I AM a  man  Sir Hargrave I will  not  It might look to an angry man like an insult which I am above intending were I to say that I have given on our first  interview  proofs that I want not courage I give you now as I think the highest I  can  give in refusing your challenge A personal insult I know how to repel I know how to defend myselfBut as I said I will not repeat any thing I have written  Mr Mer  But Sir Charles you have threatened a man of honour in what you have written if we take you right with a weapon that ought to be used only to a scoundrel yet refuse  Sir Ch  The man Sir that shall take it into his head to insult me may do it with the greater safety tho' perhaps not with impunity as he may be assured I will not kill him for it if I can help it I can play with my weapons Sir it may look like boasting but will not play with any man's life nor consent to make a sport of my own  Sir Har  Dn your coolness SirI cannot bear  Sir Ch  Curse not your safety Sir Hargrave  Mr Jor  Indeed Sir Charles I could not bear such an air of superiority  Sir Ch  It is  more  than an air Mr Jordan The man who can think of justifying one violent action by another must give a  real  superiority against himself Let Sir Hargrave confess his faultI have put him in the way of doing it with all the credit to himself that a man can have who has  committed  a faultand I offer him my hand  Sir Har  Damnable insultWhat own a fault to a man who without any provocation has dashed my teeth down my throat and as you seeGentlemensay Can I ought I  now  to have patience  Sir Ch  I intended not to do you any of this mischief Sir Hargrave I drew not my sword to return a pass made by yoursActually received a raking on my shoulder from a sword that was aimed at my heart I sought nothing but to hinder you from doing that mischief to  me  which I was resolved not to do to  you  This Sir Hargrave This gentlemen was the state of the case and the cause such as no man of honour could refuse engaging inAnd now Sir I meet you upon my own invitation in your own house unattended and alone to shew you that I have the same disposition as I had from the first to avoid doing you injury And  this  it is gentlemen that gives me a superiority to Sir Hargrave which he may lessen by behaving as I in his case would behave to him  Mr Bag  By Gthis is nobly said  Mr Jor  I own Sir Hargrave that I would sooner veil to such a Man as this than to a King on his throne  Sir Har  Dn me if I forgive him with these marks about meI insist upon your taking one of these pistols SirGentlemen my friends he boasts of his advantages He  may  have some from his cursed coolness He can have none any other way Bear witness I forgive him if he lodges a brace of bullets in my heartTake one of those pistols Sir They are equally loadedBear witness if I die that I have provoked my fate But I will die like a man of honour  Sir Ch  To  die  like a man of honour Sir Hargrave you must have  lived  like one You should be sure of your cause But these pistols are too ready a mischief Were I to meet you in  your own  way Sir Hargrave I should not expect that a man so enraged would fire his over  my  head as I should be willing to  do mine over  his  Life I would not put upon the perhaps involuntary twitch of a finger  Sir Har  Well then The sword You came tho' undressed with your sword on  Sir Ch  I did and for the reason I gave to Mr Bagenhall I draw it not however but in my own defence  Sir Har  rising from his seat Will you favour me with your company into my own garden Only you and I Sir Charles Let the gentlemen my friends stay here They shall only look out of the windows if they pleaseOnly to that grassplot Sir pointing as I sawIf  you  fall I shall have the worst of it from the looks of the matter killing a man in my own garden If  I  fall you will have the evidence of my friends to bring you off  Sir Ch  I need not look at the place Sir Hargrave And since gentlemen it is allowed that the pistols may be dismissed and since by their being loaded on the table they seem but to stimulate to mischief you will all excuse me and you Sir Hargrave will forgive me  And so saying he arose with great tranquillity as I saw and taking the pistols listed up the sash that was next to that at which Sir Hargrave stood and discharged them both out of the window  By the report the writer is sure they were well loaded  In ran a croud of servants men and women in dismay The writer sat still in the closet knowing the matter to be no worse One of the men cried out This is the murderer And they all not seeing their master as I suppose at the window beyond Sir Charles and who afterwards owned himself too much surprised to stir or speak were for making up to Sir Charles  Sir Charles then retiring put his hand upon his  sword But mildly said My friends your master is safe Take care I hurt not any of you  Sir Har  I am safeBegone scoundrels  Mr Bag  Begone Quit the room Sir Hargrave is safe  Mr Mer  Begone Begone  Mr Jor  Begone Begone  The servants as I saw crouded out as fast as they came in  Sir Charles then stepping towards Sir Hargrave said You will some time hence Sir think the discharge of those pistols much happier than if they had been put to the use designed when they were loaded I offer you my hand It is an offer that is not to be twice refused If you have malice to me I have none to you I invited myself to  breakfast  with you You and your friends shall be welcome to  dine  with me My time is near expired looking at his watchfor Sir Hargrave seemed too irresolute either to accept or refuse his hand  Mr Jor  I am astonishedWhy Sir Charles what a tranquility must you have within you The devil take me Sir Hargrave if you shall not make up matters with such a noble adversary  Mr Mer  He has won me to his side By the great God of Heaven I had rather have Sir Charles Grandison for my friend than the greatest Prince on earth  Mr Bag  Did I not  tell  you gentlemenDn me if I have not hitherto lived to nothing but to my shame I had rather be Sir Charles Grandison in this one past hour than the Great Mogul all my life  Sir Hargrave even sobbed as I could hear by his voice like a childDn my heart said he in broken sentencesAnd must I thus put upAnd must I be thus overcome By G By G Grandison you must you must walk down with me into the  garden I have something to propose to you and it will be in your own choice either to compromise or to give me the satisfaction of a gentleman But you must retire with me into the garden  Sir Ch  With all my heart Sir Hargrave  And taking oft his Sword he laid it on the table  Sir Har  And must I do so tooDn me if I doTake up your sword Sir  Sir Ch  I will to oblige you Sir Hargrave It will be always in my choice to draw it or not  Sir Har  Dn me if I can live to be  thus  treatedWhere the devil have you been till nowBut you must go lown with me into the garden  Sir Ch  Shew me the way Sir Hargrave  They all interposed But Sir Charles said Pray gentlemen let Sir Hargrave have his way We will attend you presently  The writer then came out by the gentlemens leave who staid behind at the windows They expressed their admiration of Sir Charles And Mr Merceda and Mr Bagenhall the writer mentions it to their honour reproached each other as if they had no notion of what was great and noble in man till now  Sir Charles and Sir Hargrave soon appeared in sight walking and as conversing earnestly The subject it seems was some proposals made by Sir Hargrave about the Lady which Sir Charles would not comply with And when they came to the grassplot Sir Hargrave threw open his coat and waistcoat and drew and seemed by his motions to insist upon Sir Charles's drawing likewise Sir Charles had his sword in one hand but it was undrawn the other was stuck in his side his frock was open Sir Hargrave seemed still to insist upon his drawing and put himself into a fencing attitude Sir Charles then calmly stepping towards him put down Sir Hargrave's sword with his hand and put his leftarm under Sir  Hargrave's swordarm Sir Hargrave lifted up the other arm passionately But Sir Charles who was on his guard immediately laid hold of the other arm and seemed to say something mildly to him and letting go his lefthand led him towards the house his drawn sword still in his hand Sir Hargrave seemed to expostulate and to resist being led tho' but faintly and as a man overcome with Sir Charles's behaviour and they both came up together Sir Charles's arm still within his swordarmThe writer retired to his first place Dn me said Sir Hargrave as he enter'd the room this man this Sir Charles is the devilHe has made a mere infant of me Yet he tells me he will not be my friend neither in the point my heart is set upon He threw his sword upon the floor This only I will say as I said below Be my friend in that one point and I will forgive you with all my soul  Sir Ch  The Lady is must be her own mistress Sir Hargrave I have acquired no title to any influence over her She is an excellent woman She would be a jewel in the crown of a prince But you must allow me to say She must not be terrified I do assure you that her life has been once in danger already all the care and kindness of my sister and a physician could hardly restore her  Sir Har  The most inflexible man devil I should say I ever saw in my life But you have no objection to my seeing her She shall see yet how can I forgive you that what I have suffered in my person for her sake If she will not be mine these marks shall be  hers  not  yours  And tho' I will not terrify her I will see if she has no pardon no pity for me She knows she very well knows that I was the most honourable of men to her when she was in my power By all that's sacred I intended only to make her Lady Pollexfen I saw she had as many Lovers as visitors and I could not bear itYou Sir Charles  will stand my friend and if money and love will purchase her she shall yet be mine  Sir Ch  I promise you no friendship in this case Sir Hargrave All her  relations  leave her it seems to her own discretion and who shall offer to lead her choice What I said below when you would have made  that  a condition I repeatI think she ought  not  to be yours nor ought you either for your own sake or hers to desire it Come come Sir Hargrave consider the matter better Think of some other woman if you are disposed to marry Your figure  Sir Har  Yes by GI make a pretty figure now don't I  Sir Ch  Your fortune will make you happier in marriage with any other woman after what has happen'd than this  can  make you For my own part let me tell you Sir Hargrave I would not marry the greatest princess on earth if I thought she did not love me above all other men whether I  deserved  her love or not  Sir Har  And you have no view to yourself in the advice you giveTell me thatI insist upon your telling me that  Sir Ch  Whenever I pretend to give advice I should abhor my self if I did not wholly consider the good of the person who consulted me and if I had any retrospection to myself which might in the least affect that person  The breakfast was then brought in This that follows was the conversation that passed at and after breakfast  Mr Bag  See what a Christian can do Merceda After this will you remain a Jew  Mr Mer  Let me see such  another  Christian and I will give you an answer You Bagenhall I hope will not think yourself intitled to boast of your Christianity  Mr Bag  Too true We have been both of us sad dogs  Sir Har  And I have been the most innocent man of the three and yet that's the devil of it am the greatest sufferer Curse me if I can bear to look at myself in the glass  Mr Jor  You shall be above all that Sir Hargrave And let me tell you you need not be ashamed to be overcome as you are overcome You really appear to me a  greater  and not a  less  man than you did before by your compromising with such a noble adversary  Sir Har  That's some comfort Jordan But dn me Sir Charles I will see the lady And you shall introduce me to her too  Sir Ch  That cannot beWhat Shall I introduce a gentleman to a lady whom I think he ought no more to see than she should see him If I thought you would go I might if she requested it be there lest from what she has suffer'd already she should be too much terrified  Sir Har  What Sir You would not turn  Quixote  again  Sir Ch  No need Sir Hargrave You would not again be the  giant  who should run away with the lady  The gentlemen laughed  Sir Har  By G Sir you have carried your matters very triumphantly  Sir Ch  I mean not triumph Sir Hargrave But where either truth or justice is concerned I hope I shall never palliate  Mr Bag  Curse me if I believe there is such another man in the world  Sir Ch  I am sorry to hear you say that Mr Bagenhall Occasion calls not out every man equally  Sir Har  Why did I not strike him Dn me that must have provoked you to fight  Sir Ch Provok'd  in that case I should have been Sir Hargrave I told you that I would not bear to be insulted But so warranted to take  other  methods I should not have used my sword The case has happened to me before now But I would be upon friendly terms with you Sir Hargrave  Sir Har  Curse me if I can bear my own littleness  Sir Ch  When you give this matter your cool attention you will find reason to rejoice that an enterprize begun in violence and carried on so far as you carried it concluded not worse Every opportunity you will have for exerting your good qualities or for repenting of your bad will contribute to your satisfaction to the end of your natural life You could  not  have been happy had you prevailed over me Think you that a murderer ever was an happy man I am the more serious because I would have you think of this affair It  might  have been a  very  serious one  Sir Har  You know Sir Charles that I would have compromised with you below But not one point  Sir Ch  Compromise Sir HargraveAs I told you I had no quarrel with  you  You proposed conditions which I thought should not be complied with I aimed not to carry  any  point Selfdefence I told you was the whole of my system  Mr Bag  You have given some hints Sir Charles that you have not been unused to affairs of this kind  Sir Ch  I have before now met a challenger but it was when I could not avoid it and with the resolution of standing only on my own defence and in the hope of making an enemy a friend Had I  Mr Bag  What poor toads Merceda are we  Mr Mer  Be silent Bagenhall Sir Charles had not done speaking Pray Sir Charles  Sir Ch  I was going to say that had I ever premeditatedly  way to a challenge that I  could  have  should have considered the acceptance of it as the greatest blot of my life I am naturally choleri  yet in this article I hope I have pretty much sn  ned myself In the affair between Sir Hargrave and me I have the pleasure to reflect that  passion  which I hold to be my most dangerous enemy has not had in any one moment an ascendancy over me  Sir Har  No by my soul And how should it You came off too triumphantly You were not hurt You have no  mark  to shew May I be cursed if in forgiving you which yet I know not how to do I do not think my self the greater hero  Sir Ch  I will not contest that point with you Sir Hargrave There is no doubt but the man who can subdue his passion and forgive a  real  injury is an hero Only remember Sir that it was not owing to your  virtue  that I was not hurt and that it was not my  intention  to hurt you  Mr Jor  I am charmed with your sentiments Sir Charles You must allow me the honour of your acquaintance We all acknowledge duelling to be criminal But no one has the courage to break through a bad custom  Sir Ch  The empty the  false  glory that men have to be thought brave and the apprehension of being deemed cowards among men and among  women  too very few men aim to get above  Mr Jor  But you Sir Charles have shewn that reputation and conscience are entirely reconcileable  Mr Bag  You have by Heaven And I beg of you Sir to allow me to claim your further acquaintance You may save a soul by itMerceda what say you  Mr Mer  Say What a devil can I say But the  doctrine  would have been nothing without the  example  Sir Har  And all this at my expenceBut Sir Charles I must I will have Miss Byron  Mr Jor  I think every thing impertinent that hinders me from asking questions for my information and instruction of a man so capable of giving both on a subject of this importance Allow me Sir Charles to ask a few questions in order to confirm me quite your proselyte  Sir Ch  taking out his watch as I saw Time wears Let my servant be called in The weather is cold I directed him to atend before the door  It was immediately order'd with apologies  Sir Ch  Ask me Mr Jordan what questions you please  Mr Jor  You have been challenged more than once I presume  Sir Ch  I am not a quarrelsome man But as it was early known that I made it a principle not to engage in a duel I was the more subjected I have reason to think for that to inconveniencies of this nature  Mr Jor  Had you always Sir Charles that magnanimity that intrepidity that steadiness I know not what to call it which we have seen and admire in you  Sir Ch  I have always considered Spirit as the distinction of a man My father was a man of spirit I never fear'd man since I could write man As I never sought danger or went out of my way to meet it I looked upon it when it came as an unavoidable evil and as a call upon me for fortitude And hence I hardly ever wanted that presence of mind in it which a man ought to shew and which sometimes indeed was the means of extricating me from it  Sir Har  An instance of which this morning I suppose you think has produced  Sir Ch  I had not that in my head In Italy indeed I should hardly have acted as in the instance you  hint at But in England and Sir Hargrave I was willing to think in Cavendish Square I could not but conclude myself safe I know my own heart I wish'd you no Evil Sir I was calm I  expected  to meet you full of fire full of resentment But it is hard thought I as some extraordinary step seems necessary to be taken if I cannot content myself with that superiority excuse me Sir Hargrave which my calmness and Sir Hargrave's passion must give me over him or any man My sword was in my power Had I even apprehended assassination the house of an English gentleman could not have been the place for it And where a confidence was reposed But one particular instance I own I had in my thought when I said what I did  All the gentlemen besought him to give it  Sir Charles  In the raging of the war now so seasonably for all the powers at variance concluded I was passing through a wood in Germany in my way to Manheim My servant at some distance before me was endeavouring to find out the right road there being more than one He rode back affrighted and told me he had heard a loud cry of murder succeeded by groans which grew fainter and fainter as those of a dying person and besought me to make the best of my way back As I was thinking to do so tho' my way lay through the wood and I had got more than halfway in it I beheld six Pandours issue from that inner part of the wood into which in all probability they had dragged some unhappy passenger for I saw an horse bridled and saddled without a rider grazing by the roadside They were well armed I saw no way to escape They probably knew everyavenue in and out of the wood I did not They stopped when they came within two musquetshots of me as if they had waited to see which way I took Two of them had dead poultry slung across their shoulders which shewed them to be common plunderers  I took a resolution to ride up to them I bid my servant if he saw me attacked make the best of his way for his own security while they were employed either in rifling or murdering me but if they suffered me to pass to follow me He had no portmanteau to tempt them That and my other baggage I had caused to be sent by water to ManheimI am an Englishman gentlemen said I judging if Austrians as I supposed they were that plea would not disavail me I am doubtful of my way Here is a purse holding it out As soldiers you must be gentlemen It is at your service if one or two of you will be so kind as to escort and guide me through this wood They looked upon one another I was loth they should have time to deliberateI am upon business of great consequence Pray direct me the nearest way to Manheim Take these florins  At last one that seemed of authority among them held out his hand and taking the purse said something in Sclavonian and two of them with their pieces slung on their shoulders and their sabres drawn led me out of the wood in safety but hoped at parting my farther generosity I found a few more florins for them and they rode back into the wood I suppose to their fellows and glad I was to come off so well Had I either seemed afraid of them or endeavoured to escape probably I had been lost Two persons were afterwards found murdered in the wood one of them perhaps the unhappy man whom my servant had heard cry out and groan  Mr Jor  I feel  now  very sensibly Sir Charles your danger and escape Your fortitude indeed was then of service to you  Sir Har  But Sir Charles methinks I shall be easier in myself if you give me one instance of your making before now an enemy a friend Have you one in point  Sir Ch  Stories of this nature come very ill from a man's own mouth  Sir Har  I must have it Sir Charles A brothersufferer will better reconcile me to myself  Sir Char  If you will not excuse me then I will tell you the story  Mr Jor  Pray Sir  Sir Ch  I had a misunderstanding at Venice with a young gentleman of the place He was about twentytwo I was a year younger  Mr Bag  At the Carnival I supposeAbout a Lady Sir Charles  Sir Ch  He was the only son of a noble Venetian family who had great expectations from him He was a youth of genius Another noble family at Urbino to which he was to be allied in marriage had also an interest in his welfare We had made a friendship together at Padua I was at Venice by his Invitation and stood well with all his family He took offence against me at the instigation of a designing relation of his to own the truth a Lady as you suppose Mr Bagenhall his Sister He would not allow me to defend my innocence to the face of the accuser nor yet to appeal to his father who was a person of temper as well as sense On the contrary he upbraided me in a manner that I could hardly bear I was resolved to quit Venice and took leave of his whole family the Lady excepted who would not be seen by me The father and mother parted with me with regret The young gentleman had so managed that I could not with honour appeal to them and at taking leave of him in their presence under pretence of a recommendatory Letter he gave into my hand a written challenge The answer I returned after protesting my innocence was to this effect  "I am setting out for Verona in a few hours You know my principles and I hope will better consider of the matter I never while I am master of my temper  will give myself so much cause of repentance to the last hour of my life as I should have were I to draw my Sword to the irreparable injury of any man's family or to run the same risque of injuring my own and of incurring the final perdition of us both"  Mr Mer  This answer rather provoked than satisfied I suppose  Sir Ch  Provocation was not my  intention  I designed only to remind him of the obligations we were both under to our respective families and to throw in an hint of a still superior consideration It was likely to have more force in that Roman Catholic country than I am sorry to say it it would in this Protestant one  Sir Har  How how Sir Charles did it end  Sir Ch  I went to Verona He followed me thither and endeavoured to provoke me to draw Why should I draw said I Will the decision by the sword be  certainly  that of Justice You are in a passion You have no reason to doubt either my skill or my courage On such an occasion Gentlemen and with such a view a man may perhaps be allowed to give himself a little consequence And solemnly once more do I avow my innocence and desire to be brought face to face with my accusers  He raved the more for my calmness I turned from him with intent to leave him He thought fit to offer me a personal insultI now methinks blush to tell itHe gave me a box on the ear to provoke me to draw  Mr Mer  And  did  you draw Sir  Mr Bag  To be sure you  then  drew  Mr Jord  Pray Sir Charles let us know You could not then  help  drawing This was a provocation that would justify a Saint  Sir Ch  He had forgot in that passionate moment  that  he  was a gentleman I did not remember that I was one but I had no occasion to draw  Sir Har  What a plagueYou did not cane him  Sir Ch  He got well after a fortnight's lyingby  Sir Har  Damnation  Sir Ch  I put him into possession of the lodgings I had taken for myself and into proper and safe hands He was indeed unable for a day or two to direct for himself I sent for his friends His servant did me justice as to the provocation Then it was that I was obliged in a Letter to acquaint the father of a discovery I had made which the son had refused to hear which with the Lady's confession convinced them all of my innocence His father acknowleged my moderation as the young gentleman himself did desiring a renewal of friendship But as I thought the affair had gone too far for a cordial reconciliation and knew that he would not want instigators to urge him to resent an indignity which he had however brought upon himself by a greater offered to me I took leave of him and his friends and revisited some of the German courts that of Vienna in particular where I resided some time  In the mean while the young Gentleman married His Lady of the Altieri family is an excellent woman He had a great fortune with her Soon after his nuptials he let me know that as he doubted not if I had drawn my sword I should from his violence at the time have had his life in my power he could not but acknowlege that he owed all his acquisitions and the best of wives as well as the happiness of both families with  that  life to me  I apply not this instance But Sir Hargrave as I hope to see you married and happy though it can never be I think to Miss Byron such generous acknowlegements as misbecome not an Italian I shall then hope from an Englishman  Sir Har  And had your Italian any marks left him SirDepend upon it I shall never look into a glass but I shall curse you to the very pit  Sir Ch  Well Sir Hargrave This only I will add That be as sensible as you will and  as I am  of the happy issue of this untoward affair I will never expect a compliment from you that shall tend to your abasement  Mr Jord  Your hand Sir Hardgrave to Sir Charles  Sir Har  What without termsCurse me if I doBut let him bring Miss Byron in his hand to me that is the least he can do Then may I thank him for my wife  Sir Charles made some smiling answer But the writer heard it not  Sir Charles would then have taken leave But all the Gentlemen Sir Hargrave among the rest were earnest with him to stay a little longer  Mr Jor  My conversion must be perfected Sir Charles This is a subject that concerns us all  We shall remember every tittle of the conversation  and think of it when we do not see youLet me beg of you to acquaint me how you came to differ from all other men of honour in your practice as well as in your notions upon this subject  Sir Ch  I will answer your question Mr Jordan as briefly as I can  My Father Sir was a man of spirit He had high notions of honour and he inspired me early with the same I had not passed my twelfth year when he gave me a master to teach me what is called the science of defence I was fond of the practice and soon obtained such a skill in the weapons as pleased both my Father and Master I had strength of body beyond my years The exercise added to it I had agility it added to my agility And the praises given me by  my Father and Master so heighten'd my courage that I was almost inclined to wish for a subject to exercise it upon My Mother was an excellent woman She had instilled into my earliest youth almost from infancy notions of moral rectitude and the first principles of Christianity now rather ridiculed than inculcated in our youth of condition She was ready sometimes to tremble at the consequences which she thought might follow from the attention which I paid thus encouraged and applauded to this  practice  and was continually reading lectures to me upon  true  magnanimity and upon the law of kindness benevolence and forgiveness of injuries Had I not lost her so soon as I did I should have been a more perfect scholar than I am in these noble doctrines As she knew me to be naturally hasty and very sensible of affronts and as she had observed as she told me that even in the delight she had brought me to take in doing good I shewed an over readiness even to rashness which she thought might lead me into errors that would more than overbalance the good I aimed to do she redoubled her efforts to keep me right And on this particular acquirement of a skill in the management of the weapons she frequently enforced upon me an observation of Mr Lock's  "That young men in their warm blood are often forward to think they have in vain learned to fence if they never shew their skill in a duel"  This observation insisted upon and inculcated as she knew how was very seasonable at that time of danger And she never forgot to urge upon me that the science I was learning was a science properly called of  defence  and not of  offence  at the same time endeavouring to caution me against the low company into which a dexterity at my weapons might lead me as well as against the diversions themselves exhibited at the infamous places where those brutal people resorted  Infamous even by name  Hockley in the Hole BearGarden c  as well as in the nature of them  From her instructions I had an early notion that it was much more noble to forgive an injury than to resent it and to give a life than to take it My Father I honour his memory was a man of gaiety of munificence He had great qualities But my Mother was my oracle And he was always so just to her merit as to command me to consider her as such and the rather he used to say as she distinguished well between the  false  glory and the  true  and would not have her boy a coward  Mr Mer  A good beginning by my life  Mr Jord  Pray proceed Sir Charles I am all attention  Sir Har  Ay ay we all listen  Mr Bag  Curse him that speaks next to interrupt you  Sir Ch  But what indelibly impressed upon my heart my Mother's lessons was an occurrence which and the consequences of it I shall ever deplore My Father having taken leave of my Mother on a proposed absence of a few days was in an hour after brought home as it was thought  mortally  wounded in a duel My Mother's surprise on this occasion threw her into fits from which she never after was wholly free And these and the dangerous way he continued in for some time brought her into an ill state of health broke in short her constitution so that in less than a twelvemonth my Father to his inexpressible anguish of mind continually reproaching himself on the occasion lost the best of Wives and my Sisters and I the best of Mothers and Instructors  My concern for my Father on whom I was an hourly attendant throughout the whole time of his confinement and my being by that means a witness of what both he and my mother suffered completed  my abhorrence of the vile practice of duelling I went on however in endeavouring to make myself a master of the  science  as it is called and among the other weapons of the  staff  the better to enable me to avoid drawing my sword and to impower me if called to the occasion to give and not take a life and the rather as the custom was so general that a young man of spirit and fortune at one time or other could hardly expect to escape a provocation of this sort  My Father once had a view at the persuasion of my Mother's Brother who was a general of note and interest in the Imperial service and who was very fond of a military life and of me to make a soldier of me tho' an only son and I wanted not when a boy a turn that way But the disgust I had conceived on the above occasion against duelling and the consideration of the absurd alternative which the gentlemen of our army are under either to accept a challenge contrary to laws divine and human or to be broke if they do not though a soldier is the least master of himself or of his own life of any man in the community made me think the English service tho' that of my country the least eligible of all services And for a man who was born to so considerable a stake in it to devote himself to another as my Uncle had done from principles which I approved not I could not but hesitate on the proposal young as I was As it soon became a maxim with me not to engage even in a national cause without examining the justice of it it will be the less wonder'd at that I could not think of any foreign service  Mr Bag  Then you have never seen service Sir Charles  Sir Ch  Yes I made one campaign as a volunteer notwithstanding what I have said I was then in the midst of marching armies and could not tell how to abate the ardor those martial movements had  raised in my breast But unless my country were to be unjustly invaded by a foreign enemy I think I would not on any consideration be drawn into the field again  Mr Jord  But you lead from the point Mr Bagenhall Sir Charles was going to say somewhat more on the subject of duelling  Sir Ch  When I was thus unhappily deprived of my Mother my Father in order to abate my grief I was very much grieved was pleased to consent to my going abroad in order to make the Grand Tour as it is called having first visited all the British dominions in Europe Gibraltar and Minorca excepted I then supposing I might fall into circumstances that might affect the principles my mother had been so careful to instil into me and to which my father's danger and her death had added force it was natural for me to look into history for the rise and progress of a custom so much and so justly my aversion and which was so contrary to all laws divine and human and particularly to that true heroism which Christianity enjoins when it recommends meekness moderation and humility as the glory of the human nature But I am running into length  Again Sir Charles took out his watch They were clamorous for him to proceed  When I found continued he that this unchristian custom owed its rise to the barbarous northern nations who had however some plea to make in excuse which  we  have not as they were governed by particular lords and were not united under  one  head or government to which as to a last resort persons supposing themselves aggrieved might appeal for legal redress and that these barbarous nations were  truly  barbarous and enemies to all politeness my reasoning on this occasion added new force to prejudices so well founded  The gentlemen seemed afraid that Sir Charles had done speaking They begged he would go on  I then had recourse proceeded he to the histories of nations famous for their courage That of the Romans who by that quality obtained the empire of the world was my first subject I found not any traces in their history which could countenance the sa age custom When a dispute happen'd the challenge from both parties generally was  "That each should appear at the head of the army the next engagement and give proofs of his intrepidity against the common foe"  The instance of the  Horatii  and  Curiatii  which was a  publick  a  national  combat as I may call it affords not an exception to my observation And yet even  that  in the  early ages  of Rome stands condemned by a better example For we read that Tullus challenged Albanus general of the Albans to put the cause of the two nations upon the valour of each captain's arm for the sake of sparing a greater essusion of blood But what was the answer of Albanus tho' the inducement to the challenge was so plausible  "That the cause was a publick not a private one and the decision lay upon the two cities of Alba and Rome"  Many ages afterwards Augustus received a challenge from Mark Antony Who gentlemen thought of branding as a coward that prince on his answering  "That if Antony were weary of his life he night find many  other  ways to end it than by  his  sword"  Metellus before that challenged by Sertorius answer'd with his pen not his sword  "That it was not for a captain to die the death of a common soldier"  The very Turks know nothing of this savage custom And they are a nation that raised themselves by their bravery from the most obscure beginnings into one of the greatest empires on the globe at this day They take occasion to exalt themselves above  Christians in this very instance and think it a scandal upon Mussulmans to quarrel and endeavour to wreak their private vengeance on one another  All the Christian doctrines as I have hinted are in point against it But it is dreadful to reflect that the man who would endeavour to support his arguments against this infamous practice of duelling by the Laws of Christianity tho' the most excellent of all Laws Excuse me Mr Merceda your own are  included  in them would subject himself to the ridicule of persons who call themselves Christians I have mentioned therefore Heathens and Mahometans tho' in this company perhapsBut I hope I need not however remind anybody here That that one doctrine of returning  good  for  evil  is a nobler and more heroic doctrine than  either  of those people or your  own  Mr Merceda ever knew  Mr Jord  You have shewn it Sir Charles by example by practice to be so I never saw an hero till now  Sir Ch  One  modern  instance however of a challenge refused I recollect and which may be given by way of  inference  at least to the advantage of my argument The army of the famous Mareschal Turenne in revenge for injuries more than hostile as was pretended had committed terrible depredations in the Palatinate The Elector incensed at the unsoldierly destruction challenged the Mareschal to a single combat The Mareschal's answer was to this effect  "That if the trust which the King his master had reposed in him would permit him to accept of his challenge he would not refuse it but on the contrary would deem it an honour to measure his arms with those of so illustrious a Prince But that for the sake of his master's service he must be excused"  Now tho' I think the Mareschal might have returned a still better answer tho' this was not a bad  one for a military man yet where we can as Christians and as Men plead the Divine Laws and have not when we meet as private subjects the Mareschal's nor even the  Goths  excuse I think the example worthy consideration  And if gentlemen I  have  argued before now or should I hereafter argue as follows to a challenger shall I deserve either to branded or insulted  "Of what use are the Laws of society if magistracy may be thus defied Were I to accept of your challenge and were you to prevail against me who is to challenge you and if you fall who him by whose sword you perish Where in short is the evil to stop But I will not meet you My system is selfdefence and selfdefence only Put me upon  that  and I question not but you will have cause to repent it A  premeditated  revenge is that which I will not meet you to gratify I will not dare to risque the rushing into my Maker's presence from the consequences of an act which cannot in the man that falls admit of repentance and leaves for the survivor's portion nothing but bitter remorse I fear not any more the reproaches of men than your insults on this occasion Be the latter offered to me at your  peril  It is perhaps as happy for you as for myself that I have a fear of an higher nature Be the event what it will the test you would provoke me to can decide nothing as to the justice of the cause on either side Already you will find me disposed to do you the justice you pretend to seek For your own sake therefore consider better of the matter since it is not impossible but were we to meet and both survive you may exchange what you will think a real disgrace for an imaginary one"  And thus gentlemen have I almost syllogistically argued with myself on this subject  Courage is a virtue  Passion is a vice  Passion therefore cannot be Courage  Does it not then behove every man of true honour to shew that reason has a greater share than resentment in the boldness of his resolves  And what by any degree is  so  reasonable as a regard to our duty  You called upon me gentlemen to communicate my notions on this important subject I have the more willingly obeyed you as I hope Sir Hargrave on the occasion that brought us to this not unhappy breakfasting will be the better satisfied that it has so ended and as if you are so good as to adopt them they may be of service to others of your friends in case of debates among them Indeed for my own sake I have always been ready to communicate my notions on this head in hopes sometimes to be spared provocation for as I have owned I am passionate I have pride And am often afraid of myself and the more because I am not naturally I will presume to say a timid man  Mr Bag  'Fore God Sir Hargrave somebody has escaped a scouring as the saying is  Mr Mer  Aye by my life Sir Hargrave you had like to have caught a Tartar  Sir Ch The race is not always to the swift  gentlemen Sir Hargrave's passion would doubtless have laid him under disadvantage Defence is guarded Offence exposes itself  Mr Bag  But Sir Charles you despise no man I am sure for differing from you in opinion I am a Catholic  Sir Ch  A  Roman  CatholicNo religion teaches a man evil I honour  every man  who lives up to what he professes  Mr Bag  But that is not the case with me I doubt  Mr Mer  That is  out  of doubt Bagenhall  Mr Jord  The truth is Mr Bagenhall has found his conveniencies in changing He was brought up a Protestant These  dispensations  Mr Bagenhall  Mr Mer  Ay and they were often an argument in Bagenhall's mouth for making me his proselyte  Sir Ch  Mr Bagenhall I perceive is rather of the religion of the  ourt  than of that of the  Church  of Rome  Mr Bag  But what I mean by telling you I am a Catholic is this I have read the opinion of some of our famous Casuists that in some cases a private man may become his own avenger and challenge an enemy into the field  Sir Ch Bannes  and  Cajetan  you mean one a Spaniard the other an Italian But the highest authority of your Church is full against them in this point The Council of Trent treats the combatants who fall as selfmurderers and denies them Christian burial It brands them and all those who by their presence countenance and abet this shocking and unchristian practice with perpetual infamy and condemns them to the loss of goods and estates And furthermore it deprives  ipso jure  all those sovereign princes who suffer such acts of violence to be perpetrated with impunity in the lands and cities which they hold of the Church of all the territories so held I need not add to this that Lewis the XIVth's edict against duelling was the greatest glory of his reign And permit me to conclude with observing that the base arts of poisoning by the means of treacherous agents and the cowardly practice of assassination by bravoes hired on purpose to wreak a private revenge so frequent in Italy are natural  branches  of this old  Gothic tree  And yet as I have before hinted the barbarous northern nations had pleas to make in behalf of duelling from  their  polity which we have not from  ours  Christianity out of the question  The gentlemen said they would very seriously reflect upon all that had passed in this uncommon conversation  Sir Har  Well but Sir Charles I must recur to my old noteMiss ByronShe must be mine And I hope you will not stand in my way  Sir Ch  The Lady is her own mistress I shall be glad to see any and all of you gentlemen at St James's Square  Mr Bag  One thing I believe it is proper to mention to Sir Charles Grandison You know Sir that I brought a young man to your house to take minutes of the conversation that passed between you and me there in apprehension of consequences In  like  apprehensions I prevailed upon Sir Hargrave  Sir Har  And now Bagenhall I could curse you for it The affairconfound itthat I meant to be recorded for my own justification has turned out to his honour Now am I down in black and white for a tamefoolIs it not so  Mr Jord  By no means If you think so Sir Hargrave you have but ill profited by Sir Charles's noble sentiments  Sir Cha  How is this Mr Bagenhall  Mr Bag  I prevailed upon Sir Hargrave to have the same young man who is honest discreet and one of the swiftest shorthand writers of the age to take a faithful account of everthing that has passed and he is in that closet  Sir Ch  I must say this is very extraordinaryBut as I always speak what I think if I am not afraid of my own recollection I need not of any man's minutes  Mr Bag  You need not in this case Sir Charles Nothing has passed as Sir Hargrave observes but what makes for your honour We that set him to work have more need to be afraid than you We  bid him be honest and not spare any of us We little thought matters would have ended so amicably  Mr Jord  Thank God they have  Mr Mer  A very happy ending I think  Sir Har  Not except Miss Byron consents to wipe out these marks  Mr Bag  Mr Cotes your task is over Pray step in with what you have done  The writer obeyed Mr Bagenhall asked If the minutes should be read Sir Hargrave swore No except as he said he had made a better figure in the debate Sir Charles told them he could not stay to hear them But that as they  were  written and as he had been allowed before a copy of what passed between him and Mr Bagenhall he should be glad to have one now and the rather as Sir Hargrave should have an instance after he had perused it of his readiness to condemn himself if he found he had been wanting either to his own character or to that of any man present  They consented that I should send Sir Charles the first fair copy Sir Charles then took his leave  The gentlemen all stood silent for several minutes when they returned from attending him to the door looking upon ane another as if each expected the other to speak But when they spoke it was all in praise of Sir Charles as the most modest the most polite the bravest and noblest of men Yet his maxims they said were confoundedly strange impracticable for such sorry dogs as them that was their phrase to practise  But Sir Hargrave seemed greatly disturbed and dejected He could not he said support himself under the consciousness of his own inferiority But what could I do said he The  devil  could not have made him fight Plague take him he beat me out of my play  And yet said Mr Merceda a tiltingbout seems no more to him than a game at pushpin  You would have thought so said Sir Hargrave had you observed with what a sleight and with what unconcernedness he pushed down my drawn sword with his hand tho' he would grant me nothing and took me under the arm and led me in to you as tho' he had taken me prisoner The devil has long continued he owed me a shame But who would have thought he had so much power over Sir Charles Grandison as to get him to pay it me But however I never will be easy till Miss Byron is Lady Pollexfen  I take leave honoured Sir to observe that a few things are noted in this copy which to avoid giving offence will not be in that I shall write for the gentlemen I was ordered to shew it to Mr Bagenhall before you had it but for this reason I shall excuse myself as having not remembered that command  This therefore is a true copy of  all  that passed taken to the best of the ability of Sir give me leave to subscribe  Your very great admirer and most humble servant HENRY COTES  Continuation of Miss  BYRON'S  Letter  WHAT a pacquet including the shorthand writer's paper transcribed by my cousin Reeves shall I send you this time I will not swell it by reflections on that paper that would be endless but hasten to give you some account of the visits I mentioned  Sir Hargrave Pollexfen came without any notice about nine o' clock  My heart sunk whan his chair stopt at the door and I was told who was in it  He was shewn into the great parlour My cousin Reeves's soon attended him He made great apologies to them and so Mr Reeves said he ought for the disturbance he had given them  He laid all to LoveProstituted name made to cover all acts of violence indiscretion folly in both sexes  I was in my own apartment Mrs Reeves came up to me She found me in terror and went down and told him so and begged that he would not insist upon seeing me  The whole intent of this visit he said was to beg me to forgive him It was probable that I should have the same emotion upon his first visit at any other time and he entreated the favour of seeing me He had a  right  he said to see me He was a sufferer for my sake They saw he told them that he was not the man he had  been  and as he had been denied and been brought to deny himself the satisfaction due to a gentleman from a man whom he had never offended he insisted on having the opportunity given him of seeing me and receiving my forgiveness as what would consolidate his reconciliation with Sir Charles Grandison  There was no resisting this plea  And down I  trembled  I can hardly say walked  Notwithstanding all my little reasoning with myself to behave with the dignity of an injured person yet the moment I saw him approach me at my entrance into the parlour I ran to Mr Reeves and caught hold of his arm with looks I doubt not of terror Had Sir Charles Grandison been there I suppose I should have run to him in the same manner  Everdear and adorable goodness were his words coming to me how sweet is this terror and how just  I  have forgiven worse injuries pointing to his mouth I meant nothing but honour to  you  Honour  Sir Cruelty Sir Barbarity Sir How can you wish to see the creature whom you so wickedly treated  I appeal to yourself Madam if I offered the least indecencyFor all I have suffered by my mad enterprize what but disgrace  Disgrace Sir was your portion Sir half out of breathWhat would you SirWhy this visit What am I to do  I hardly knew what I said and still I held Mr Reeves's arm  Forgive me Madam That is what you are to do Pardon me On my knee I beg your pardon And he dropt down on one knee  Kneel not to me SirPray do not kneelYou bruised you hurt you terrified me SirAnd Lord bless me I was in danger of being your  wife  Sir  Was not this last part of my answer a very odd one But the memory of what I suffered at the time and of the narrow escape I had left me not the least presence of mind on his address to me kneeling  He arose  In danger of being my wife  Madam Only that the method I took was wrong Madam  Miss Byron you see is in terror Sir HargraveSit down my love taking my hand and leading me to the fireside How you tremble my dearYou see Sir Hargrave the terror my cousin is inYou see  I doI do and am sorry for the occasionWe will all sit down Compose yourself dear Miss ByronAnd holding up his clasped hands to me I beseech you forgive me  Well Sir I forgive youI forgive you Sir  Were you not in so much disorder MadamWere it to be seasonable nowI would tell you what I have further to beg I would  Speak Sir now and never let me  Suffer an interruption MadamI am too apprehensive of that word  never  You  must  allow of my address I ask you not any favour but as I shall behave myself in future  Yes yes Sir your behaviourBut Sir were you to become the best man in the world this this is the last time that I ever  Dear Miss Byron And then he pleaded his passion his fortune his  sufferings  A wretch Yet I had nowandthen a little pity for his disfigured mouth and lipHis resolutions to be governed by me in every act of his lifeThe settlement of one half of his estate upon meThe  odious  wretch mentioned  children  my dear  younger  children He ran on in such a manner as if he had been drawing up marriagearticles all the way hither  Upon my absolutely renouncing him he asked me If Sir Charles Grandison had not made an impression on my heart  What Lucy could make me inwardly fret at this question I could hardly have patience to reply I now see my dear that I have indeed a great deal of pride  Surely Sir Hargrave I am not accountable to you  You are not Madam But I must insist upon an answer to this question If Sir Charles Grandison has made an application to you for favour I can have no hope  Sir Charles Grandison Sir is absolutely disinterested Sir Charles Grandison has madeThere I stopt I could not help it  No application to my cousin I assure you Sir Hargrave said Mr Reeves He is the noblest of men Had he any such thoughts I dare say he would be under difficulties to break his mind lest such a  declaration should be thought to lessen the merit of his protection  A good thought of Mr Reeves And who knows my Lucy but there may be some foundation for it  Protection  Dn itBut I am the  easier  upon this assurance Let me tell you Mr Reeves that had I not sound him to be a wonder of a man matters should not have ended as they seem at present to have done  But Sir Hargrave said Mrs Reeves permit me to say as I know Miss Byron's mind that there cannot be the least room to imagine that Miss Byron  Dear Mrs Reeves forgive me But I cannot receive a denial from any other mouth than hers Is there no room for a sincere penitent to hope for mercy from a sweetness so angelic and who is absolutely disengaged  You have had  mine  already Sir Hargrave said I I am amaz'd that knowing my mind  before  your wicked insult upon me you should have any expectation of this kind  after  it  He again vowed his passion and such stuff  I think Lucy I never shall be able for the future to hear with patience any man talk of love of passion and such nonsense  Let me summarily add for I am tired of the subject that he said an hundred impertinent things sillier than any of those said by Mr Grandison in my praise indeed everything of this nature now appears silly to meHe insisted upon a preference to Mr Greville Mr Fenwick Mr OrmeHe resolved not to despair as his sufferings for my sake had given him as he said he presumed to hope some merit in his own opinion if not in mine and as his forgiveness of the man who had injured him ought he thought to have some weight in his favour  He took leave of my cousins and me in a very respectful  manner I wish him no harm But I hope I shall never see him again  And now Lucy with the end of this very disagreeable visit I will conclude my letter and shall have another long one ready for the next post  LETTER V Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  LUCY SELBY  March  I Had not recovered myself after Sir Hargrave's visit when Lady L and Miss Grandison called as they said for a moment however this agreeable moment lasted two hours Miss Grandison the instant she saw me challenged meHey day What's the matter with our Harriet Mrs Reeves And patting my neck Why these flutters childPerturbations delightful or undelightful Harriet whether  I told her who had been here and but just left me and by the help of my cousins gave them the particulars of what had passed  They were greatly pleased and the more they said as their brother on seeing them uneasy had acquainted them that all matters between him and Sir Hargrave were accommodated but had not had opportunity to tell them more  Let me reckon with you Harriet said Miss Grandison taking my hand with a schooling air I am halfjealous of you Lady L has got the start of me in my brother's affections But she is my elder sister first come first served I can bear that but I will not be cut out by a younger sister  What is now to follow thought I and flutter'd like a fool the more for her arch look as if she would read my heart in my eyes  Increased palpitation O the fool made it look as  if I took her jest for earnest What a situation am I in  Dear Charlotte said Lady L smiling you shall not thus perplex our sweet sisterMy dear don't mind her You'll know her better in time  Be quiet Lady L I shall have it all out  All what out said I O Miss Grandison how you love to alarm  Well well I'll examine farther into these perturbations another time I have beat the bush before now for one hare and out have popt two But all I mean is a paper a letter my brother called it a paper was brought to him sealed up He rewarded the bringer but sent it directly away unopened that we found out to you Harriet Now child if I allow of  his  reserves I will not allow of  yours  Pray answer me fairly and truly What are the contents of that paper  They give the particulars of the conversation that passed in the alarming interview between Sir Charles  And Sir Hargrave That's my good girl You see Lady L how this young thief will steal away the affections of our brother from us both He has shewed  us  nothing of this But if you would not have me jealous Harriet be sure keep no one secret of your heart from me  That relates merely to myself I think I will not  Then you'll be a good girl And I'll give my love for you the reins without a pull back  Just then a servant came in with a card  "Lady D's compliments to Mrs Reeves and Miss Byron and if it would be agreeable she will wait on them presently for one quarter of an hour She is obliged to go out of town early in the morning"  What shall I do now said I I was in a flutter not being fully recovered from that into which Sir Hargrave's visit had thrown me  What nowWhat now said Miss Grandison Ah Harriet we shall find you out by degrees  By the way Lucy you are fond of plays and it is come into my head that to avoid all  saysI's  and  saysshe's  I will henceforth in all Dialogues write names in the margin So fansy my dear that you are reading in one of your favourite volumes  Harriet  Do you know Lady D  Miss Gr  Very well But I did not know that you did Harriet  Lady L  And I know she has a son and I know she wants him to marry  Harriet  That I may keep no secrets from my two sisters my aunt Selby has written to me  Miss Gr  Lately  Harriet  Very lately  Miss Gr  O because you had not told me of that  Mrs Reeves  And pray Ladies what is Lady D's character  Lady L  She is a very good woman She is a sensible and prudent woman  Miss Gr  I am not very intimate with her But have seen her in two or three of my visits I have always thought her soAnd pray Harriet don't you want to know what character my  Lord  bears  Harriet  My Lord is nothing to me I  have  answered I have given my negative  Miss Gr  The duce you haveWhy the man has a good  l  a year  Harriet  I don't care  Miss Gr  What a duce ails the girl  Then humourously telling on her fingersORME  one  FENWICK  two  GREVILLE  three  FOWLER  four  I want another finger but I'll take in my thumbSIR HARGRAVE  five  And now putting the forefinger of one hand on the thumb of the other  LORD D  six  And none of them the manDepend upon it girl pride will have a fall  What could she mean by thatSir Charles Grandison's sisters I hope will notBut I believe she meant nothing  Have I pride Miss Grandison coldly and gravely as my cousin observed to me afterwards asked I  Miss Gr  Have you prideYes that you have or you have  worse  What could  this  mad  Lady  mean by thisAnd what could  I  mean For I had tears in my eyes I was very lowspirited at that moment  Lady L  Well but Miss Byron shall we be impertinent if we stay to see the LadyI have a great value for her She has been an admirable executrix and trustee for her son and was as good a wife I was just going but will stay to pay my compliments to her as she goes out of town tomorrow We can withdraw till you have had your talk  Miss Gr  Does she come to persuade you Harriet to retract your refusal  Harriet  I know not her business I wrote my mind to my aunt Selby But I believe my aunt could not have written and the countess received what she wrote by this time But do not go We can have no private talk  Miss Gr  Well but now I will tell you without punishing your curiosity farther what Lord D's character is He is as sober a man as most of the young n  bility His fortune is great In sense he neither abounds nor is wanting and that class of men take my  ord  are the best qualified of all others to make good husbands  women of superior talents They know j  st enough to induce th  m to admire in  her  what they have not in  th  mse  ves  If a woman has pru  nce enough to give  onseque  ce to such a one  ore  and will beha  thought him her superior in understanding she will be able to make her own will a law to him by the way of  I will Shall I  Or  If you please  my dear  I will dowhat I think fit  But a fool and a wit are the extreme points and equally unmanageable And now tell me Harriet what can be your motive for refusing such a man as this  Harriet  I wish my dear you would not talk to me of these men I am sick of them allSir Hargrave has cured me  Miss Gr  You fib my dearBut did you ever see Lord D  Harriet  No indeed  Miss Gr  "No indeed"Why then you are a simpleton child What refuse a man an Earl too in the bloom of his years good pounds a year yet never have seen himYour motives child Your motivesI wish you are not alreadyThere she stopt  Harriet  And I wish Miss Grandison with all my heart if that would tame you that you were in love over head and ears and could not help it  Miss Gr  And wish you me that for spite or to please meI  am  in love my dear and nothing keeps me in countenance but having company among the grave ones Dearly do I love to find girls out Why I found out Lady L before she would own a tittle of the matter So prim  "And  how can you think so  Charlotte  Who I in love  No indeed No man has a place in  my  heart"  Then I was resolv'd to have her secret out I began with my  roundabouts  and my  suppose's  A  leer  as thusI was both vex'd and pleased with her archness And then a  suppose  Then came a blush  "Why Charlotte I cannot but say that if I were  obliged  to have the one man or the other"  Then came a sigh endeavoured in haste to be returned to the heart whence it came and when it could not find its way  back to be cut into threehalves as the Irishman said that is into two halfsighs and a hem and a "Get you gone for an impertinent"As much as to say "You have it"And when I found I  had  and she own'd it why then I put my mad head to her grave one and we had but one heart betwixt us  Lady L  laughingOut of breath Charlotte I hope  Miss Gr  Not yetHow often have I kept watch and ward for her sometimes have I lent her my dressingroom for their lovemeetings Yet for the world she would not marry without her papa's consent No but like the rest of us she would suffer her affections to be  engaged  without letting him know a syllable of the matterVery true Lady L what signifies looking serious  Lady L  Strange creature  Miss Gr  Once or twice did I change dresses with her In short I was a perfect Abigail to her in the affair And let me tell you two sisters agreed to manage a loveaffair have advantages over even a Lady and her woman  Lady L  Mad creature  Miss Gr  All this I did for her without fee or reward only from the dear delight of promoting the good work and upon the christian principle of Do as you would be done byIs not all this true Lady L Deny it if you can  Lady L  And have you done Charlotte Ah my dear Miss Byron you'll never do any thing with this girl except you hear all she has to say And if you  have  a secret 'tis better to let her know it at first Charlotte is a generous girl after all But sometimes as now a very impertinent one  What could these ladies mean by this I wonder If they suspect me to love somebody surely this is not the way that two such Ladies in  generosity  should take when they think I have no engagement and  know that the doubt must lie on their brother's side whom with all their  roundabouts  as they call them they cannot fathom  I would give anything methinks to know if Sir Charles was ever in love  Just then a rapping at the door made us suppose it was the Countess It was After compliments to Mrs Reeves and me she embraced Lady L very affectionately and Miss Grandison kindly asking the first after Lord L's health and the other after her Brother He is the man of all men Miss Grandison said she that I want to see We shall be in town soon for a month or two and then you must make me known to one whom every body calls the best of men As here said she coming up again to me I have longed to be acquainted with one of the best of women  Lady L  Miss Byron is indeed an excellent young woman We do ourselves the honour of calling her  sister  Lady D  What an encouragement is that to be good Even in this age bad as it is true merit will never want admirers And let me say that where beauty and goodness meet as  here  they adorn each other  Agreeable Lady D thought I My heart will not suggest a thought in favour of your  son  but I shall easily be in love with  you  The heart hardly deserves praise my Lucy that is not fond of it from the worthy  Her Ladyship took Lady L aside and said something to her Lady L answered with a No as I suppose To which Lady D replied I am glad of that adding I am not afraid of saying anything to a person of Lady L's known prudence  Ah my Lucy She asked Lady L I dare say whether the acknowleged sisterhood extended to the brother as a brother or assomething elseAnd  by her chearful and condescending court to me afterwards and to Mrs Reeves was satisfied by Lady L's answer I make no doubt that there is room for Lord D's address for any thing on Sir Charles's part  I will not be mean Lucy Greatly as I admire somebody these excellent sisters shall not find me  entangled in an hopeless passion  Her Ladyship took my hand and led me to the window I was brought to town said she on an extraordinary occasion two days ago and must set out on my return in the morning I thought I would not miss the opportunity of paying my compliments to a young Lady of whom I had heard everybody speak with great commendation I make no doubt but your good aunt Selby hasThere she stopt  My aunt has sent me up two of your Ladyship's letters and copies of her answers  I am pleased with your frankness my dear It was that part of your character that engaged me Young women in these cases are generally either so affected so starched as if they thought there were something shameful in a treaty of this kind or they are so aukward that I have not patience with them You have all the modestyIndeed my dear your goodness of heart shines out in every feature of your face  Your Ladyship does me high honour  I am pleased even with that acknowlegement The discretion of a person is often most seen in minutenesses Another would have made disqualifying speechesBut compliments made to the heart by one who is not accustomed to flatter such compliments I mean as it would be culpable for a person not to be able to verify should not be disclaimed To say truth my dear I did not intend to mention one word of the matter to you on this first visit I only wanted to see you and to converse with you a little that I might make report accordingly to my son who however knows not that I should pay my compliments  to you But the moment I saw you your aspect confirmed all that I had heard said in your favour and seeing you also so much caressed by two ladies of characters so establish'd and no less pleased with what I observed of Mr and Mrs Reeves You are a family of good people I was resolved to be as frank as you are and as your aunt Selby has beenShe is a good woman  Indeed madam she is  Accordingly I have singled you out in the face of everybody presentYou will have the discretion to caution them on this subject till you have seen my son I am sure there can be no doubt on his sideand till you know whether you shall approve of our proposals or not And without hesitation I bespeak your good opinion of  me  till then I am sure my dear we shall be very happy in each other If you and my Lord are happy you and I  must  be soBut when the knot is tied I will be only your visitor and that at your own invitation I am thought to be a managing woman Managing women are not generally the best to live with You I understand are an excellent oeconomist A glorious character in this age for a young womanPersons of the highest quality ought not to think themselves above it One person's methods may differ from another's yet both may be equally good and reach the same end My son has found the  benefit  of my oeconomy Nevertheless his wife shall not have cause to think that where she means well I will prefer my methods to hers If ever I give advice it shall be only when you ask it And then if you do not take it I will not be angry but allow that having weighed the matter well you prefer your own judgment on the best convictions People who are to act for themselves should be always left to judge for themselves because they only are answerable for their own actions You blush my dear  I hope I don't oppress you I would not oppress a modesty so happily blended with frankness  I was affected with her goodness What an amiable frankness O that all husbands mothers were like your Ladyship said IWhat numbers of happy daughtersinlaw would there then be that now are not so  Charming creature said she Proceed I am glad I don't oppress you with my prate  Oppress  me madamYou delight me Talk of a bad world  I  ought I am sure to think it a good oneIn every matronly Lady I have met with a  mother  In many young Ladies as those before us  sisters  In their brother a  protector  If your Ladyship has not heard on what occasion I shall be ready to acquaint you with it  Sweet child Charming frankness I have  seen  I have  heard  enough of you for my present purposeWe will return to companySuch company as I find you in is not to be had at all times I will restore you to them  But madam declining her leading hand  But what my dear  Have you not madamBut your Ladyship could  not  have received any letter from my aunt SelbyI wrote  I have  not  my dear I could not as you say But I shall find a letter from her perhaps on my return You approve I hope of the proposal if you shall have no objection to my son  My aunt madam will let you know  I will not have it otherwise than I wish it to beRemember that I value you for the frankness you are praised forA little female trifling to my  son  if you will in order to be assured of his value for you and men love not all halcyon courtships but none to  me  my love I'll assist you and keep your counsel in the first case if it be necessary He shall love you  above all the women on earth and convince you that he does or he shall not call you hisBut no female trifling to his mother child We women should always understand one another  Because I would not be thought to be an insincere creature a trifler I think I ought to mention to your Ladyship that it would be a great a very great part of my happiness to be deemed worthy of your friendshipwithout  Without whatYou do well perhaps to blush Without what  Without the relationif you please  I was confounded with her goodness Lucy Here my dear is another superior characterI fancy her maidenname was Grandison  But I  don't please  So no more of this Let us join company And taking my hand with the goodness of a real mother yet her brow a little overclouded she made apologies to them for taking me aside and said she could trust to their prudence she was sure as they must needs guess at her view and therefore she offered not to put a limit to their conjectures since denial or evasion would but in this case as it  generally  did defeat its own end and strengthen what it aimed to weaken  Is there no obtaining such a mother thought I without marrying Lord DAnd should I refuse to see him if an interview is desired especially when Lady L has seemed to encourage the countess to think that somebody has no thoughtsIndeed I don't desire that that somebody shouldIfI don't know what I was going to add to that  if  But pray tell my grandmamma that I hope her Harriet will never give her cause to lament her being  entangled in an hopeless passion  No indeed  But my Lucy one silly question to  you  who have been a little  entangled  and more happily  disentangled  I catch my self of late in saying  him  and  he  and  writing to you  somebody  and suchlike words instead of saying and writing boldly as I used to do Sir Charles and Sir Charles Grandison which would sound more respectfully and yet am sure I want not respect What is the meaning of thisIs it a signAh my Lucy you said you would keep a sharp lookout and did I not say I would upon myself Surely I said truth Surely you will think so when you see such little silly things as these do not escape me But when you think me too trifling my dear don't expose me Don't read it out in the venerable circle That to some may appear very weak and silly which by others will be thought excusable because natural It would be wrong as I yet never did it to write separately to you And what have I in my heart were it to be laid open to all the world that I should beafraidI was going to write that I should be  ashamed  of But I think I  am  a little ashamed at times for all thatAh Lucy don't add and so I ought  Lady D repeated her desire of being acquainted with Sir Charles She has no daughter So it was purely for the sake of his great character She heard she said that he was the politest of brothers That was always a good sign with her He gives you Miss Grandison I am told a great deal of his company  Miss Grandison said that their brother she believed was one of the busiest men in the kingdom who was not engaged in public affairs and yet the most of a familyman I endeavour said she to make home delightful to him I never break in upon him when he is in his study without leave Indeed I seldom ask it for when he is inclin'd to give me his company he sends his compliments to me and requests as a favour  from  me what I am always ready to consider as one done  to  me And I see he loves me He is not uneasy in my company He comes  for half an hour and stays an hourBut don't set me into talking of him for my heart always dilates when I enter into the agreeable subject and I know not where to stop  Lady L  Charlotte is a happy girl  Miss Gr  And Lady L is a happy woman for he loves her as well as he loves me Indeed he is so good as to say but I know it is to keep us from pulling caps that he knows not which he loves best We have different qualities he says and he admires in each what the other has not  Lady D  But what are his employments What can he be so much busied in  M ss Gr  A continual round of good offices He has a ward She has a large fortune The attention he pays to her affairs takes up a good deal of his time He is his own steward and then he has a variety of other engagements of which we ask him not one word yet long to know something about themBut this we are sure of that if he thinks anything will give us pleasure we shall hear of it if the contrary he is as secret as the night  Will nobody say one bad or one indifferent thing of this man Lucy There is no bearing these things O my dear what a Nobody is your poor Harriet  Lady D  He is one of the handsomest men in England they tell me  Miss Gr  Sisters are not judges They may be partial His benignity of heart makes his face shine Had I a lover but half as handsome as I think my brother I should make no objection to him on the account of person  Lady L  But he is the genteelest of menWhat think  you  sister Harriet  Harriet  Sisters are not judges They may be partial  What meant Lady L to apply to me But I had been some time silent She  could  not mean anything  And both sisters complimented me on recognizing the relation  Lady D asked me how long I should stay in town  I said I believed not long I had leave for three months Those would be soon elapsed and as my friends were so good as to be pleased with my company I should rather choose to walk within than step out of my limits  The Countess with a nod of approbation said With good young people it will be always so And this is more praiseworthy in Miss Byron as she may do what she pleases  Then taking me a little asideI hope my dear you meant nothing contrary to my wishes when you referred in so doubtful a manner to what you had written to your aunt You don't answer me This is a call upon your frankness Women when anything is depending on which they have set their hearts are impatientDon't you know thatThey love not suspense  It is painful to me Madam to decline a proposal that would give me a relation to so excellent a womanBut  But  what  my dearLet not maidenly affectation step in with its cold water You are above it Woman to woman daughter to motherYou are above it  Then turning to the Ladies and to my cousinsYou don't know any of you We are by ourselves that Miss Byron's heart is engaged Miss Grandison let me apply to you Maiden Ladies open their hearts to one another Know you whether Miss Byron has yet seen the man to whom she wishes to give her hand Her aunt Selby writes to me that she has not  Miss Gr  We young women madam often know least of our own hearts We are almost as unwilling  to find out ourselves in certain cases as to be found out by others Speak sister Harriet answer for yourself  Was not this grievous Lucy And yet what ailed me that I could not speak without hesitation But this Lady's condescending goodnessYet this wicked Sir Hargrave His attempt his cruel treatment of me has made me quite another creature than I was  My aunt Selby madam wrote the truth To say I wish not to marry for some time to come may sound like an affectation because I have ever honoured the stateBut something has happen'd that has put me out of conceit with myself and with men too  Lady D  With  all  men childI will allow for a great many things in a  weak  mind that I will not in  yours  I have had an hint or two about an insult or I know not what from Sir Hargrave Pollexfen since I came to town for I have ask'd after you my dear But what is that but a confirmation of your merits What a disagreeable woman must she be whom but one man in the world could like  But excuse me Miss Byron I have said abundance of impertinent things I have gone further on this first visit than I intended You must thank for this that ingenuous and open countenance which confirms at first sight the character I had heard given by everybody who spoke of you I shall see perhaps what your aunt Selby to whom you refer writes when I get down I shall soon be in town as I said for the rest of the winter and then I will make myself mistress of your whole history from these ladies and from yourself And there shall end all my enquiries and I hope all my solicitudes on an article that is next my heartMean time adieu my dearAdieu  She then courtesying to all round gave her hand to Mr Reeves who led her to her chair leaving us all full of her praises  Miss Gr  looking archly I say nothing as to her  particular  errand because I would not be too curious and because you ask me no questions Harriet  Lady L  This must do Miss Byron Who would not▪ wish for such a mother  Harriet  Is the mother to be the principal inducement in such an article as this  Miss Gr  Why my dear do you pretend in such an age of petitsmaitres as this to live single till you meet with a man who deserves youBut Harriet you must voluntarily open your heart to me I have a good deal of curiosity and whenever you are disposed to gratify it will not  withdraw  my attention  Harriet  I will read to you this moment if you please Ladies as to my sisters what Lady D wrote to my aunt Selby and what my aunt answered on the occasion  Miss Gr  That's my best Harriet I love to hear  how  and  every thing about  these sort of matters  Lady L  These girls Mrs Reeves delight in lovesubjects There is a kind of enthusiasm in these matters that runs away with them  Miss Gr  Say you so Lady L And pray had you ever any of this enthusiasm And if you had did matrimony cure you of itSee Harriet my sister has not been married many months yet how quietly she now talks of the  enthusiasm  of love to us maidensAh my dear Lady L women I see have their freemasonry as well as men Don't you think so Mrs Reeves A poor secret after all I believe on both sides whisper'd the lively Lady but loud enough for everyone to hear what she said  Lady L called her a mad girl But let us be favour'd said she to me with your communications  I pulled out the letters I read the two first paragraphs in my aunt's letter to me entire for they propose the matter and nothing else  What follows said I is full of love and care and so forth But here is one paragraph more I can read to you  Miss Gr  As much reserve as you please sister Harriet I am learning how to deal with you  Lady L  Why that Charlotte No fear that you will tell us more than you have a mind we should know Regard not therefore this threatening Miss Byron  Harriet  To own the truth I cannot read everything my aunt writes But the Countess of D's proposals and what relates to that I will read if you please  Miss Gr  What you willRead what you will I find we are not at present so well acquainted as we shall be hereafter  What could Miss Grandison mean by that  I read the last paragraph but one in which my aunt proposes my coming down and that I will either encourage the countess's proposal or accept of Mr Orme ending with the earnest desire of my friends to have me married  I then gave into Miss Grandison's hand the countess's first Letter and she read it out  She gave it me back and thanked me Were all women said she capable of acting thus  frankly  the sex would leave affectation to the menmonkeys Remember Harriet that your openness of heart is one of the graces for which I principally admire you  Lady L  O the rogue take care of her Miss Byron She tells you this to get out of you all your secrets  Miss Grandison may easily obtain her end madam She need only tell me what she best likes I should be and I must try to be that  Miss Gr  Good girl And take this along with you that when you convince  me  that you will not  hide  I will convince  you  that I will not  seek  But what is next  I then gave into her hand the copy of my aunt Selby's answer  Miss Gr  May I read it all  Harriet  If you please The fondness of my aunt and the partiality of  Miss Gr  Away awayNo affectation child  She read it out Both sisters praised the heart of the dear and thriceindulgent writer and called her  their  aunt Selby  I then gave Miss Grandison the Countess's second letter They were no less pleased with that than with the first  Miss Gr  But now your opinion of the proposal child Will you trust us with that Have you a copy of what you wrote  Harriet  I kept a copy only of what immediately respected the proposal and that because it was possible I might want to have recourse to it as my aunt might or might not write farther about it  I took it out of my pocketbook and gave it to her to read  Thank you child said she I should have no curiosity if I did not love you  She read it out It was the paragraph that begins with  "You will upon the strength of what I have said" c ending with "  Such is my meaning  "  Luckily I had not transcribed the concluding sentence of that paragraph having been ashamed of the odd words  Hope of your hope  Lady L  But  why  should that be your  meaning  my dear  Harriet  I added I remember that I was pained by the teazings of these men one after another that I never took delight in their airy adulation and was now the more pained because of the vile attempt of Sir Hargrave which had given me a surfeit of the sex  Miss Gr  A temporary surfeit It is over I hope by this time But my dearAnd yet as I owe to  your generosity the communication I would not take occasion from it to teaze you  Harriet  Miss Grandison will oblige me say what she pleases  Miss Gr  As you intend to marryAs your friends are very desirous that you  should  As Lady D is an excellent womanAs her son is as men go a tolerable manAs he is a peer of the realm which is something in the scale tho' it is not of weight singly consider'dAs his estate is very considerableAs you may have your own termsAs you like not any one of your numerous admirersAll these  As's  considered why why in the name of goodness should you give so flat a denial Yet have not seen the gentleman and therefore  can  have no dislikes either to his sense or person I wish my dear you would give such a reason for your denial a denial so  strongly  expressed as one would imagine such a woman as the countess of D would be satisfied with from such a one as Miss Byron  Lady L  Perhaps now that Miss Byron has seen what a lady the countess of D is  Miss Gr  And now that she has overcome the  temporary surfeit  Lady L  She will change her mind  Are you not my dear aunt Selby are you not my Lucy distressed for me at this place I was at the time greatly so for myself  Harriet  My mind has been greatly disturbed by Sir Hargrave's violence and by apprehensions of fatal mischiefs that might  too  probably have followed the generous protection given me I was teazed before by  good  menMr Orme and Sir Rowland Meredith in behalf of his nephew and by men not so  good  Mr Greville and Mr Fenwick And when I had hoped to have a little respite a little leisure to look about me and to collect my almost dissipated spirits to have this new proposal made to my friends and to me and by a lady so worthy wonder not Ladies if I am unable on a  sudden to give such reasons for having refused to listen to it as you require altho' at the same time I find not in my heart the least inclination to encourage it  Miss Gr  You have had your difficulties of late my Harriet to contend with And those you must look upon as a tax to be paid by a merit so conspicuous Even in this slighter case as you love to oblige I can pity you for the situation you are likely to be in betwixt the refused son and the deserving mother But when you consider that the plagues of the discreet proceed from other people those of the indiscreet from themselves you will sit down with a just compliment to yourself and be content You see I can be grave now and then child  Harriet  May I deserve to be called prudent and discreet On that condition I am willing to incur the penalty  Lady L  Come come that is out of the question my dear So you are contented of course or in the way to be so  The Ladies took their leave and seemed pleased with their visit  It is now my dear friends somehow or other become necessary I think to let you minutely into my situation that you may advise caution instruct meFor I protest I am in a sort of wildernessPray my Lucy tell meBut it cannot be from  Love  So I don't careYet to lie under such a weight of obligation and to find myself so much surpassed by these ladiesYet it is not from  Envy  surely That is a very bad passion I hope my bosom has not a place in it for such a mean selftormentor Can it be from  Pride  Pride is a vice that always produces mortification And proud you all made me of your favourYet I thought it was grateful to be proud of it  I wish I were with you Lucy I should ask you abundance of questions and repose my anxious heart on your faithful bosom and at the same time from  your answers arm it against too great a sensibility before it was too late But pray don't I remember that you said you found sighing a relief to you on a certain occasion I am serious my dear That there was a sort of youknownotwhat of  pleasure  in sighing Yet that it was involuntaryDid you not say that you were ready to quarrel with yourself you knew not whyAnd pray had you not a fretting▪ gnawing pain in your stomach that made you I can't tell how to describe it yet were humble meek as if looking out for pity from every body and ready to pity everybodyWere you not attentive to stories of people young women especially labouring under doubts and difficultiesWas not your humanity raised your selfconsequence lower'd But did you not think  suspense  the greatest of all tormentsI think my dear you lived without eating or drinking yet look'd not pining but freshPure Love is perhaps to lovers as the manna of heaven was to the Israelites But yet Israelitelike we may be uneasy and murmur at the  toomuch  of itYour restI remember it was broken In your sleep you seemed to be disturbed You were continually rollingdown mountains or tumbling from precipicesor were borne down by tempests carried away with sudden inundations or sinking in deep waters or flying from fires thieves robbers  How apt are we to recollect or to  try  to recollect when we are apprehensive that a case may possibly be our own all those circumstances of which while another's however dear that other might be to us we had not any clear or adequate ideasBut I know that such of these as I recollect not from  you  must be owing to the danger to the terror I was in from the violence of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen Often and often do I dream over again what I suffered from him I am now imploring mercy from him and meet with nothing but upbraidings and menaces He is  now stopping my mouth with his handkerchief His horrible clergyman if a clergyman he was is reading the service quite through And I am contending against the legality of the asserted marriage At other times I have escaped and he is pursuing me He gains upon my flying feet and I wake myself with endeavouring in vain to cry out for help  But when fancy is more propitious to me then comes my rescuer my deliverer And he is sometimes a mighty prince dreams then make me a perfect romancer and I am a damsel in distress The milkwhite palfrey once came in All the Marvellous takes place and lyons and tygers are slain and armies routed by the puissance of his single arm  Now do not these resveries convince you that I owe all my uneasiness to what I suffered from Sir Hargrave's barbarity I think I must take my aunt's advice leave London and then I shall better find out whether as all my friends suspect and as to be ingenuous I myself now begin sometimes to fear a passion stronger than gratitude has not taken hold of my heart Of this I am sure My reasoning faculties are weaken'd Miss Grandison says that in my illness at Colnebrooke I was dilirious and that the doctor they called in was afraid of my head And should I suffer myself to be  entangled in an hopeless passion  there will want no further proof that my intellects have suffer'd  Adieu my Lucy What a letter have I written The conclusion of it I doubt will of itself be a sufficient evidence of the weakness I have mentioned both of head and heart of  Your  HARRIET  LETTER VI Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  LUCY SELBY  Sat Mar  THIS morning Sir Hargrave Pollexfen made Mr Reeves a visit He said it was to him but I was unluckily below and forced to hear all he had to say or to appear unpolite  He proposed visiting my grandmamma and aunt Selby in order to implore their forgiveness But Mr Reeves diverted him from thinking of that  He had not sought me he said at Lady Betty Williams's but from his desire on the character he had heard of me to pay his addresses to me in preference to every other woman He had laid out for several opportunities to get into my company before he heard I was to dine there Particularly he once had resolved to pay a visit in form to my uncle Selby in Northamptonshire and had got all his equipage in readiness to set out but heard that I was come to town with Mr and Mrs Reeves He actually then set out he said for Peterborough with intent to propose the affair to my godfather Deane But found that he was gone to Cambridge And then being resolved to try his fate with me he came to town and hardly questioned succeeding when he understood that my friends left me to my own choice and knowing that he could offer such proposals as none of the gentlemen who had made pretensions to be were able to make His intentions therefore were not sudden and such as arose upon what he saw of me at Lady Betty Williams's tho' the part I supported in the conversation there precipitated his declaration  He was very unhappy he said to have so mortally disobliged me and repeated all his former pleas his  love Rough love I am sure compassion sufferings and I cannot tell what insisting that he had forgiven much greater injuries as was but  too  apparent  I told him that I had suffer'd more than he could have done tho' his hurt was more visible than mine That nevertheless I forgave him as no bad consequences had followed between him and my protectorProtector mutter'd heBut that he knew my mind before he made that barbarous attempt And I besought him never more to think of me and he must excuse me to say that this must be the very last time I ever would see him  A great deal was said on both sides my cousins remaining attentively silent all the time And at last he insisted that I would declare that I never would be the wife either of Mr Greville or Mr Fenwick Assuring me that the rash step he had taken to make me his was owing principally to his apprehension that Mr Greville was more likely to succeed with me than any other man  I owed him I told him no such declaration But Mr Reeves to get rid of his importunity gave it as his opinion that there was no ground for his apprehensions that I would give my hand to either and I did not contradict him  Mr Bagenhall and Mr Jordan before I could get away from this importunate man came to enquire for him He then owned that they came in hope of seeing me and besought me to favour him and them for one quarter of an hour only I was resolved to withdraw But at Sir Hargrave's command as impertinently given as officiously obeyed Mr Reeves's servant led them his master indeed not contradicting into the parlour where we were  The two strangers behaved with great respect They came with a resolution to be pleased with me and would not suffer themselves to be disappointed But never did men run praises higher than both these  gentlemen gave to Sir Charles Grandison And indeed the subject made me easier in their company than I should otherwise have been  It is not possible I believe for the vainest mind to hear itself prosusely praised without some pain But it is surely one of the sweetest pleasures in the world to hear a whole company join in applauding the absent person who stands high in our opinion and especially if he be one to whose unexceptionable goodness we  owe  and are not ashamed to  own  obligation  What further pleased me was to hear Mr Bagenhall declare which he did in a very serious manner that Sir Charles Grandison's  great  behaviour as he justly called it had made such impressions not only upon him but upon Mr Merceda that they were both determined  to turn over a new leaf  was his phrase and to live very different lives from what they  had  lived tho' they were far they blessed God from being before the worst of men  These gentlemen with Mr Merceda and Sir Hargrave are to dine with Sir Charles to day They both mentioned it with great pleasure But Sir Hargrave did not seem so well pleased and doubted of his being able to persuade himself to go The invitation was given at Mr Jordan's motion who took hold of an indirect invitation of Sir Charles's Mr Jordan declaring that he was resolved not to let slip any opportunity of improving an acquaintance with so extraordinary a man  The gentlemen took a very respectful leave Sir Hargrave shewed so much dejection and is so really mortified with the damage done to a face that he used to take pleasure to see reflected in the glass never once looking into either of th  se in the parlour he was in all the time he staid that I could once or twice have been concerned for him had I not struggled to withheld my pity  He talk'd of soon leaving town and retiring to one  of his countryseats or of going abroad for a year or two if he must have no hopesHopes a wretch  When I seriously reflect I don't know whether his mortification is not the happiest thing that could have befallen him It wants only to be attended with patienceHe is not  now  an ugly man in his person His estate will always give him consequence He will now think the better of others and the worse of himself He  may much  worse and not want as much vanity as comes to his share  But say you my uncle as I fansy you do that I also may spare some of  my  vanity and not be the worse girlAh noI am now very sensible of my own defects I am poor low silly weakWas I ever insolent Was I ever saucy Was I everO my uncle hide my faults I am mortified Let me not reproach myself with having  deserved  mortification If I did I knew it not I intended not to be saucy vain insolentAnd if I was so lay it to a flow of health and good spirits to time of life young gay and priding myself in everyone's love yet most in the love in the fond indulgence of all you my good friends And then you will have some of my faults to lay at your own doors nor will you even  you  my uncle be clear of reproach because your correction was always mingled with so much praise that I thought you were but at play with your niece and that you levelled your blame more at the Sex than at your Harriet  BUT what have I written against myself I believe I am  not  such a low silly weak creature as I had thought myself For just as I had laid down my pen with a pensive air and to look into the state of my own heart in order either to lighten or to confirm the selfblame I had so glibly written down Lady L in her chair made us a visit She came up directly to me I am come to dine with your cousins and you  Miss Byron said she Shall I be welcome But don't answer me I know I shall  Mrs Reeves enter'd and acknowledged the favour  Sir Hargrave Pollexfen and some of his brethren are to dine with my brother said my Lady and I not being obliged to do the honours of the table with my Lord's consent made my escape I cannot endure the wretch who could make such a vile attempt upon you and who might have murder'd my brotherCome will you let me see what you are writeing You can forgive  Charlotte  's freedom Will you excuse her  sister  's  I cannot shew your Ladyship all I have written but I will read you some passages of the long letter before me  I told her my subject and read to her such as I thought I could read She raved at Sir Hargrave Wonder'd he had the confidence to approach me especially with hope She prais'd me Yet said to my cousin Reeves that he ought to have been denied the house and the rather as I was myself very unwilling to see him  I own I thought so too Both my cousins are  too  goodnatur'd  We had a great deal of talk about the duel that was to happily prevented Lady L gave us an account of the unhappy one which her father fought and to the issue of which they owed the loss of the best of mothers And at and after dinner she piously expatiated on the excellencies of that mother and demonstrated what I have often thought of great consequence my grandmamma's and aunt Selby's examples before me affording the noblest proofs that the conduct of women in their families is of high importance and that they need not to look out of them so often as they do to employ themselves and that not only in the most useful but in the most delightful manner  My Lord L having broke from the company at Sir Charles's did us the honour to drink tea with us Everything he said passed very agreeably among the gentlemen he had left and it was his opinion that his brother's noble behaviour and the conversation that passed at table and in which he left him and them engaged would make more than one convert among them  He told Lady L that Sir Charles was to set out on Monday for Canterbury For Canterbury Lucy and that he should take it for a favour if she would give him her company for a few days to Colnebrooke Their house in Brookstreet he said would be ready to receive them in a week's time It wanted nothing but a thorough airing And if said he you could prevail upon Miss Grandison to be with us till her brother returns and both sisters could induce Miss Byron to make a fourth we shall be said he the happiest party in the world and perhaps may get Sir Charles among us on his return for a day or two I bowed  I must tell you my Lord that Charlotte and I thought to offer our attendance on Miss Byron to some of the public entertainments But your Lordship's pleasure shall determine me and if we could be so happy as to have Miss Byron for our guest I am sure of my sister and it would be my preferable wish Mr Reeves Mrs Reeves will you spare Miss Byron to me  I looked as if for their leave They gave a smiling assent  My Lord and Lady both expressed themselves overjoy'd  This Canterbury ran in my head It was brought in naturally enough and Mrs Reeves wonder'd that Sir Charles kept secret the motive of his journeying thither backward and forward  The godlike man  said Mr Reeves in the words of a great poet  has nothing to conceal  For my part replied my Lord I conclude  the motive is rather a painful than a pleasurable one Charlotte accuses her brother of reserves I never found him reserved But he loves to play with her curiosity and amuse her For she is very curious yet has  her  secretHas she not Lady L  Indeed she has replied my LadyPerhaps you my dear will be intrusted with it when you are at Colnebrooke together  Pray madam said I to Lady L may I askDoes Sir Charles give Lord G his interest in his addresses to Miss Grandison  Lady L  My brother wishes Charlotte married He is a great friend to the married state especially with regard to our sex  Mr Reeves could not miss this opportunity It is a wonder said he that Sir Charles himself does not think of marriage  Lady L  That is a string that we but just touch sometimes and away There is a Lady  There she stopt Had she looked with earnestness at me I had been undone I believe  ☞ Let me ask you Lucy You have passed the fiery ordealDid you ever find in yourself a kind of impatience next to petulance and in your heart only for fear of exposing yourself that you were ready to quarrel or to be short with anybody that came upon you of a sudden yet have no business of consequence to engage either your fingers or your thoughtsOf late my dear I have been very often troubled with this odd sensation But my whole temper is altering I believe I shall grow peevish perverse and gloomy I doubt O this wicked Sir Hargrave☜  Pray my dear attend for the future to those indexes or hands and forbear to read out the passages inclosed by them if you canBut if you come upon them before you are aware why then read onwith all my heart  But to return to Lady L's alarming hint  "There is a Lady"    Mrs Reeves  That Sir Charles loves I suppose  Lady L  That loves Sir Charles and she hasBut for the Lady's sakeYet if it be allowable for any woman to be in love with any man upon an uncertainty of return it is for one that is in love with my brother  Harriet  And cannot Sir Charles make a returnPoor Lady  My cousin afterwards told me that my upperlip then quiver'd like an aspen leaf I did not know that it did I felt not a trembling at my heart and when the lip trembles the heart I think should be affected There used to be a close connexion between mine  Mr Reeves  Miss Grandison told  me  that if her brother married half a score women would break their hearts  Lady L  The words  half a score  run as glibly off the tongue as  half a dozen  But I believe let the envious the censorious malign our sex and charge us with the love of rakes and libertines as they will if all men were like my brother there would not be a single woman and hardly a bad one in the kingdom What say you my Lord  Lord L  My dear life you know I am all attention whenever you or my sister Charlotte make our brother the subject of your panegyric If Miss Byron you do not choose to hear so much said of this best of men you will I doubt have an ill time of it in the favour you will do us at Colnebrooke  Harriet  My Lord I should be very ungrateful if I did not hear with pleasure everything that shall be said in praise of Sir Charles Grandison  Lord L  When I am out of conceit with men as too often they give me cause to be I think of my brother and forgive them  I wonder Lucy what everybody  means  by praising  Sir Charles Grandison so much in my hearingShall I fly from town to avoid hearing his praisesYes say youBut whither It must not be to Selbyhouse Well then I may as well go to Colnebrooke I shall there be informed of the reasons for all those general applauses for hitherto I know nothing of his history to what they tell me I am to know  These general praises carried us away from a subject that I thought we should once have made more of  That one Lady  And I wanted to know but had no opportunity to inform myself whether that Lady's relations or herself live at Canterbury On Monday it seems Sir Charles sets out for  that  Canterbury  Our noble guests would not stay supper They had not been gone two hours before I had an humourous letter from Miss Grandison I inclose it  Sat night o'clock  LORD and Lady L rejoice me by telling me you will accompany them to Colnebrooke on MondayThat's my good girlI will go with them for the sake of your company Yet I had halfdenied them And why Because if you must knowBut hushand catch a mouseBecause a certain Impertinent proposes a visit there and I had thoughts to take the opportunity of being alone in town to rid my hands for ever if possible of another silly fellow of whom for one  month  a great while ago I thought tolerably  You and I Harriet will open to each other all our hearts There is one chamber that has two beds in it We will have that Our dressingroom shall be common to both Lady L is a  morningkiller  She always loved her bed So we shall have charming opportunities for tête à tête conversation  I will drink tea with you tomorrowNo but I won't You and your cousins shall drink tea with usDo you hear I won't be denied And then we'll settle how it shall be I'll tell you what my dear  If on my brother's return from Canterbury he comes to us at Colnebrooke we will call him to account for all his reserves Here is this affair of Pollexfen's How might it have ended I tremble to think of itYou'll stand by me Won't you I cannot make Lord and Lady L of my party or I would have rebelled before nowBut you and I my dear I warrant youYet you are so grave Were you always such a grave such a wise such a  very  wise girl Harriet Was your grandfather a very sententious man Was his name  Solomon  Shirley  I love wisdom as well as anybody But wisdom out of its place is a prude my dear How I rambleYou'll come tomorrowI designed but two lines Adieu Believe me  Ever Yours  C G  I hope Lucy I was not wrong in so readily consenting to go to Colnebrooke My own inclination indeed was in my compliance and I begin to mistrust myself whereever that strongly leads Yet why should I undervalue myself I know my heart to be good In that I will not yield to anybody I have no littleness in my mind  Naturally  I have not Guard me O my friends by your prayers that no littleness that is  not  natural to my heart may depreciate it and make me unworthy of the love you have ever shewn to  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER VII Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  LUCY SELBY  Sunday Mar  MY cousins will have it that I am far gone in a certain passion They speak quite out and with a man that has given no encouragementEncouragement  how meanly sounds that word But I hope they are mistaken I cannot say but one may prefer if one were to have one's choiceone man to anotherBut that is a different thing from being run away with by so  vehement  a folly as they are ready to ascribe to me  Well but under this notion they are solicitous that I should not neglect any opportunity What a poor creature do they think me of  ingratiating  myself with the sisters And therefore I must by all means accept of Miss Grandison's invitation to tea  I insisted however that they should accompany me as they likewise were invited And they obliged meI may say  themselves  too for they admire the brother and sisters as much as I do  We found together Lord and Lady L Miss Grandison Miss Jervois Dr Bartlett and Mr Grandison Sir Charles was in his drawingroom adjoining to the study a lady with him they said What business had I to wish to know whether it was an elderly or a young lady But I must tell you all my follies When we alighted a very genteel chair made way for our coach  Mr Grandison made up to me and as heretofore said very silly things but with an air as if he were accustomed to say such and to have them received as gallant things by those to whom he addressed them How painful is it to a mind not quite at ease to be obliged to be civil when the ear is invaded by contemptible speeches from a man who must think as highly of himself for uttering them as meanly of the understanding of the person he is speaking to  Miss Grandison saw me a little uneasy and came up to us Mr Grandison said she I thought you had known Miss Byron's character by this time She is something more than a pretty woman She has a  soul  Sir The man who makes a compliment to her on her beauty depreciates her understanding  She then led me to her seat and sat down next me  Mr Grandison was in the midst of a fine speech and was not well pleased He sat down threw one leg over the knee of the other hemm'd three or four times took out his snuffbox tapped it let the snuff drop thro' his singers then broke the lumps then shut it and twirled it round with the forefinger of his righthand as he held it between the thumb and forefinger of the other and was quite like a sullen boy Yet after a while tried to recover himself by forcing a laugh at a slight thing or two said in company that was not intended to raise one  I think my dear I could have allowed a little more for him had not his name been Grandison  We soon adjusted everything for the little journey Mr Grandison told Miss Grandison that if she would make him amends for her treatment of him just now she should put Lord L upon inviting  him  Lord and Lady L joined to do so But Miss Grandison would not admit of his going and I was glad of it  But not to affront you cousin said she Miss Byron and I want to have a good deal of particular conversation So shall not be able to spare  you  an hour of our company at Colnebrooke But one thing Sir My brother sets out for Canterbury tomorrow Tell him that  we  won't be troubled with your company Ask him if  he  will  Not in those words neither cousin Charlotte But I will offer my attendance and if he accepts of it I shall be half as happy as if I went to Colnebrooke and  only  half bowing to me  Why now you are a good docible kind of man I want to hear what will be my brother's answer For we know not one syllable nor can guess at his business at Canterbury  The teaequipage being brought in we heard Sir Charles's voice complimenting a lady to her chair and who pleaded engagement for declining to drink  tea with his sister And then he enter'd the parlour to us He addressed my cousins who were next him with his usual politeness He then came to me How does my good Miss Byron Not discomposed I hope by your yesterday's visitors They are all of them in love with you But you must have been painedI was pained for you when I heard they had visited you But extraordinary merit has some forfeitures to pay  I am sure then thought I you must have a great many Everytime I see him I think he rises upon me in the gracefulness of his behaviour  I have one agreeable piece of news to tell you madam Sir Hargrave will go abroad for a twelvemonth He says he cannot be in the same kingdom with you and not see you He hopes therefore to lessen the torment by flying from the temptation Mr Bagenhall and Mr Merceda will go with him  Then whispering me he said from an hint in the letter of the penitent Wilson that Mr Bagenhall's circumstances are not happy and that he is too much in the power of Sir Hargrave I have prevailed on the latter in consideration of the other's accompanying him abroad to make him easy And would you believe it and can you forgive meI have brought Sir Hargrave to give Wilson the promised  l  To induce him to do this Merceda influenced by the arguments I urged founded on the unhappy fellow's confessions in that letter offer'd  l  more for his past services to himself And both as a proof of the sincerity of their promised reformation Wilson shall not have the money but upon his marrying the girl to whom he is contracted And on my return from a little excursion I am making to Canterbury I shall put all in a train And now let me ask you once more can you forgive me for  rewarding  as you may think it a base servant  O Sir how can I answer youYou told me at  Colnebrooke that we were to endeavour to bring good out of the evil from which you had deliver'd me This indeed is making your words true in a very extensive sense To make your enemies your friends to put wicked men into a way of reformation and to make it a bad man's interest to be good  Forgive  you SirFrom what I remember of that poor wretch's letter I was obliged to him myself Tho' vile he was less vile than he might have been The young woman behaved with tenderness to me at Paddington Let me therefore add  l  to Mr Merceda's  l  as an earnest that I can follow a noble example  You charm me madam said he I am not disappointed in my opinion of youThe fellow if he give hope of real penitence shall not want the fourth  l  It would be  too good  in you so great a sufferer as you were by his wickedness to give it But it will become a man to do it who has not been injured by him and who was the occasion of his losing the favour of his employer and the rather as he was an adviser to his fellowagents to fly and not to fire at my servants who might have suffer'd from a  sturdier  villain He has promised repentance and reformation This small sum will give me a kind of right to enforce the performanceBut no more of this just now  Miss Jervois just then looking as if she would be glad to speak with her guardian he arose and taking her hand led her to the window She was in a supplicating attitude as if asking a favour He seemed to be all kindness and affection to herHappy girlMiss Grandison who had heard enough of what he said of Wilson to be affected whisper'd me Did I not tell you Harriet that my brother was continually employed in doing good He has invention forecast and contrivance But you see how those qualities are all employed  O Miss Grandison said I I am such a nothing  I cannot as Sir Hargrave says bear my own littleness  Be quiet said sheYou are an exceeding good girl But you have a monstrous deal of pride Early I saw that You are not half so good as the famous Greek who losing an election for which he stood to be one of only thank'd the gods that there were in Athens I think it was better men than himself Will you not have honour enough if it can be said that next to Sir Charles Grandison you are the best creature in the world  Sir Charles led his ward to a seat and sat down by us  Cousin Charlotte said Mr Grandison you remember your treatment of me for addressing Miss Byron in an open and I thought a very polite manner Pray where's your impartiality Sir Charles has been shut up in his study with a Lady who would not be seen by anybody elseBut Sir Charles may do anything  I am afraid it is too late cousin said Miss Grandison Else it would be worth your while to try for a reputation  Has Charlotte Mr Grandison said Sir Charles used you ill Ladies will do as they please with you gallant men They look upon you as their own and you wish them to do so You must bear the inconvenience for the sake of the convenience  Well but Sir Charles I am refused to be of the Colnebrooke partyAbsolutely refused Will  you  accept of my company Shall I attend you to Canterbury  Are you in earnest cousin Grandison Will you oblige me with your company  With all my heart and soul Sir Charles  With all mine I accept your kind offer  This agreeably surprised his sisters as well as me But why then so secret so reserved to them  Mr Grandison immediately went out to give orders to his servant for the journey  A goodnatur'd man said Sir CharlesCharlotte you are sometimes too quick upon himAre you not  Too quick upon himNo no I have hopes of him for he can be asham'd That was not always the case with him Between your gentleness and my quickness we shall make something of him in time  Mr Grandison immediately return'd and we lost something that Sir Charles was going to reply But by some words he dropt the purport was to blame his sister for not sparing Mr Grandison before company  I imagine Sir Charles that if you take Mr Grandison with you one may venture to ask a question Whether you go to any family at Canterbury that we have heard ofIt is to do good I am sure  Your eyes have ask'd me that question several times Charlotte I aim not at making secrets of any thing I do I need not on this occasion Yet you Charlotte have your secrets  He look'd grave  Have I my secrets Sir CharlesPray what do you mean  She colour'd and seem'd sensibly touch'd  Too much emotion Charlotte is a kind of confession Take care Then turning it off with a smileSee Mr Grandison I am revenging your cause Alarming spirits love not to be alarmed  So Harriet whispering to me I am silenced Had I told you all my heart I should half have suspected you How he has flutter'd meLady L this is owing to you whispering her behind my chair  I know nothing therefore could tell nothing Conscience conscience Charlotte rewhisper'd Lady L  She sat still and was silent for a little while Lord and Lady L smiling and seeming to enjoy her agreeable confusion At lastBut Sir Charles you  always  had secrets You got out of me two or three of mine without exchangeYou  Don't be uneasy my Charlotte I expected a  prompt  not a  deliberate  reply My life is a various life Some things I had better not have known myself See Charlotte if you are serious you will make me so I have not any motives of action I hope that are either capricious or conceited Surely Lucy he cannot have seen what I wrote to you about his reserves I thought he look'd at meOnly this one hint my sister Whenever you condescend to consult me let me have everything before me that shall be necessary to enable me to form a judgmentBut why so grave Charlotte Impute all I have said as a revenge of Mr Grandison's cause in gratitude for his obliging offer of accompanying me to Canterbury  Cannot you reward  him  Sir Charles but by punishing  me  A good question Charlotte But do you take what I have said in that light  I have done for the present Sir But I hope when you return we shall come to an eclaircissement  Needs  it oneWill not better and more interesting subjects have taken place by that timeAnd he look'd at her with an eye of particular meaning  Now is he beginning to wind about me whisper'd she to me as I told you at Colnebrooke Were he and I alone he'd have me before I knew where I was Had he been a wicked man he would have been a  very  wicked one  She was visibly uneasy but was afraid to say any more on the subject  Lady L whisper'dAh Charlotte you are taken in your own toils You had better let me into your secret I would bring you off if I could  Be quiet Lady L  We then talk'd of the time in the morning of our setting out for Colnebrooke I thought I read Miss  Emily's mind in her eyesShall we not have the pleasure of Miss Jervois's company said I  She bowed to me and smiled  The very thing that Emily was petitioning to me for said Sir Charles And I wish'd ladies to have the motion come from one of you  Emily shall go with us I think said Miss Grandison  Thank you madam said she I will take care not to break in upon you impertinently  What dost thou too think we have secrets child  Consent with your usual grace Charlotte Are you not too easily affected Sir Charles spoke this smiling Every thing you say Sir Charles affects me  I ought then to be very careful of what I say If I have given my sister pain I beg her to forgive me  I am afraid to go on whisper'd she to me Were he and I only together my heart would be in his hand in a moment  I have only this to observe Miss Grandison whisper'd IWhen you are too hard upon me I know to whom to apply for revenge  Such another word Harriet and I'll blow you up  What could she mean by that  Blow me up  I have lock'd up my aunts last lettets where so much is said about  entangling  and  Inclination  and soforth When anything occurs that we care not to own I see by Miss Grandison that it is easy for the slightest hint to alarm us  But Sir Charles to say so seriously as he did  "That his life was a various life" and that "he had better not have known some things himself"  affects me not a litte What can a man of his prudence have had to disturb him But my favourite author says  Yet with a sigh o'er all mankind I grant  In this our  day of proof  our  land of hope  The good man has his clouds that intervene  Clouds that  obscure  his sublunary day  But never conquer Ev'n the best must own  Patience  and  resignation  are the pillars  Of human peace on earth  Nightthoughts  But so young a man so prudent as I said and so generally beloved But that he is so may be the occasionSome lady I doubtWhat sad people are we women at this rate Yet some women may have the worst of it What are your thoughts on all these appearances Lucy  Miss Grandison as I said is uneasy These are the words that disturb her  "Only this one hint my sister Whenever you condescend to consult me let me have everything before me that shall be necessary to enable me to form a judgment"  And so they would  me  in her case  But it seems plain from Sir Charles's hint that he keeps to himself as Miss Grandison once indeed said in his favour those intelligences which would disturb her and his other friends to know The secret which he would have made of the wicked challenge his selfinvited breakfasting with Sir Hargrave are proofs among others of this And if this be his considerate motive what a forward what a censorious creature have I been on so many occasions to blame him for his reserves and particularly for his Canterbury excursions I think I will be cautious for the future how I take upon me to censure those actions which in such a man I cannot account for  Miss Grandison on her brother's withdrawing with Dr Bartlett said Well now that my cousin Grandison will accompany my brother to Canterbury we shall have that secret out in course  Lady L  It seems to be your fault Charlotte that we have not had it before  Miss Gr  Be quiet Lady L  Mr Gr  Perhaps not You'll find I can keep a secret cousin especially if I am desired to do so  Miss Gr  I shall wonder at that  Mr Gr  Why so  Miss Gr  Shall I give it you in plain english  Mr Gr  You don't use to mince it  Miss Gr  It would be strange cousin if a man should make a secret of an innocent piece of intelligence who has told stories of himself and gloried in them that he ought if true to have been hanged forYou would have it  Mr Gr  I knew I must have the plain english whether I  ask'd  for it or not But give me leave to say cousin Charlotte that you made not so superior a figure just now  Miss Gr  True Mr Grandison There is but one man in the world of whom I stand in awe  Mr Gr  I believe it and hope you never design to marry for  that  reason  Miss Gr  What a wretch is my cousin Must a woman stand in awe of her husband Whether Sir is marriage a state of servitude or of freedom to a woman  Mr Gr  Of freedom as women generally make itOf servitude if they know their dutyPardon me Ladies  Miss Gr  Don't pardon him I suppose Sir it is owing to your consciousness that you have only the  will  and not the  spirit  to awe a woman of sense that you are a single man at this day  Lady L  Pray my Lord what have I done that you treat me with so much contempt  Lord L Contempt  my best lifeHow is that  Lady L  You seem not to think it worth your while to  overawe  me  Miss Gr  Lord my dear how you are mistaken in applying thus to Lord L Lord L is a good man a virtuous man None but rakes hold these  overawing  doctrines They know what they deserve and live in continal fear of meeting with their deserts and so if they marry having the hearts of slaves they become tyrants Miss Byron  Mr Gr  The devil's in it if you two Ladies want help I fly the pit  Lord L  And I think Mr Grandison you have fought a hard battle  Mr Gr  By my soul I think so too I have held it out better than I used to do  Miss Gr  I protest I think you have We shall brighten you up among us I am mistaken if there were not two or three smart things said by my cousin Pray did anybody mind them I should be glad to hear them again Do you recollect them yourself cousin  Mr Gr  You want to draw me on again cousin Charlotte But the dl fetch me if you do I'll leave off while I am well  Miss Gr  Would you have thought it Lady L My cousin has  discretion  as well as  smartness  I congratulate you Sir A new discoveryBut hush 'Tis time for both to have done  Sir Charles enter'd Mr Grandison a sufferer again said he  Mr Gr  No no Pretty well off this boutMiss Byron I have had the better end of the staff I believe  Harriet  I can't say that Sir But you got off I believe in very good time  Mr Gr  And that's a victory to what it used to be I can assure you Nobody ever could  awe  Miss Grandison  Miss Gr  CowardYou would  now  begin again would youSir Charles loves to take me  down  Mr Gr  Never madam but when you are  up  And laugh'd heartily  Miss Gr  Witty tooA man of repartee A  verbal  wit And that's half as good as a punster at any time  Sir Ch  Fight it out cousin Grandison You can laugh on tho' the laugh of every other person should be against you  Mr Gr  And thou BrutusIt is time to have done  As I think these conversations characteristic I hope the recital of them will be excused Yet I am sensible those things that go off well in conversation do not always  read  to equal advantage  They would fain have engaged us to stay to supper But we excused ourselves I promised to breakfast with them  I chose not to take my maid with me Jenny is to be made over to me occasionally for the time of my stay Dr Bartlett had desired to be excused So our party is only the two Sisters Lord L Miss Jervois and I  Sir Charles and Mr Grandison are to set out for their journey early in the morning  Adieu my Lucy It is late And sleepiness promises to befriend  Your  HARRIET  LETTER VIII Mrs  SELBY  To Miss  BYRON  This Letter and the two that follow it are inserted in this place tho' not received and answered till Miss Byron was at Colnebrooke for the sake of keeping entire the subject she writes upon from thence    Selbyhouse  Sunday Mar  My dearest Child  WE are all extremely affected with your present situation Such apparent struggles betwixt your natural openness of heart and the confessions of a young  of a new passion and that so laudably founded and so visibly increasingO my Love you must not affect reserves They will sit very aukwardly upon a young woman who never knew what affectation and concealment were  You have laid me under a difficulty with respect to Lady D She is to be with me on Saturday next I I have not written to her tho' you desired I would since in truth we all think that her proposals deserve consideration and because we are afraid that a  greater  happiness will never be yours and ours It is impossible my dear to imagine that such a man as Sir Charles Grandison should not have seen the woman whom he could love before he saw you or whom he had not been engaged to love by his  gratitude  as I may call it for her  Love  Has not his sister talk'd of half a score Ladies who would break their hearts for him were he to marryAnd may not this be the reason why he does not  You see what an amiable openness of heart there is in the countess of D You see that your own frankness is a particular recommendation of you to her I had told her that you were disengaged in your affections By your own disclaiming to her the proposed relation you have given reason to so wise a Lady to think it otherwise or that you are not so much above affectation as she had hoped you were And tho' we were grieved to read how much you were pushed by Miss Grandison  Letter V p  yet Lady D will undoubtedly make the same observations and inferences that Miss Grandison did And what would you have me do since you cannot give a stronger instance of your affections being engaged than by declining such a proposal as Lady D made before you have conversed with or even seen Lord D And it becomes not your character nor mine either to equivocate or to say the thing that is not  Lady L you think and indeed so it appears hinted to Lady D that Sir Charles stands not in the way of Lord D's application I see not therefore that there can be any room to hope from that quarter Nor will your fortune I doubt be thought considerable enough And as Sir Charles is not engaged by affection and is generous and munificent there is hardly room to imagine but that in prudence fortune will have some weight with him At least on our side that ought to be supposed and to make a part of our first proposals were a treaty to be begun  Your grandmamma will write to you with her own hand I refer myself wholly to her Her wisdom and her tenderness for you we all know She and I have talked of  everything  Your uncle will not railly you as he has done We still continue resolved not to prescribe to your inclinations We are afraid therefore of advising you as to this new proposal But your grandmamma is very much pleased that I have not written as you would have had me a letter of absolute refusal to the countess  Your uncle has been enquiring into the state of Sir Charles Grandison's affairs We have heard so many good things of him that I have desired Mr Selby to make no further enquiries unless we could have some hopes of calling him ours But do you my dear nevertheless omit nothing that comes to your knowledge that may let us know in him what a good man is and should be  His magnanimity in refusing to engage in a duel yet acquitting himself so honourably as to leave no doubt about his courage is an example of itself of a more than human rectitude of thinking and acting How would your grandfather have cherished such a young man We every one of us admire and revere him at the same time and congratulate you my dear and his sisters on the happy issue of the affair between him and that vile Sir Hargrave  You will let me know your mind as to the affair of Lord D and that by the next post Be not rash Be not hasty▪ I am afraid I push'd your delicacy too much in my former Your uncle says that you are at times not so frank in directly owning your passion as from your natural openess of heart he expected you would be when a worthy object had attracted you And he triumphs over us in the imagination that he has at last detected you of affectation in some little degree We all see and own your struggle between virginmodesty and openess of heart as apparent in many passages of your letters and we lay part of your reserve to the apprehensions you must have of his raillery But after you have declared  "That you had rather converse but one hour in a week with Sir Charles Grandison"  and  his sister  you put in And sisters are good convenient people sometimes to a bashful or beginning lover of our sex  "than be the wife of any man you have ever seen or known and that mean as the word  pity  sounds you would rather have his pity than the love of any other man"  Upon my word my dear you need not be backward to speak quite out Excuse me my child  I have just now read the inclosed Had I known your grandmamma could have written so long a letter I might have spared much of mine Hers is worthy of her We all subscribe to it but yet will be determined by your next as to the steps to be taken in relation to the proposal of Lady D But if you love be not ashamed to own it to us The man is Sir Charles Grandison  With all our blessings and prayers for you I bid you my dear Love Adieu  MARIANNA SELBY  LETTER IX Mrs  SHIRLEY  To Miss  BYRON  Sunday March  DON'T be afraid don't be ashamed my dearest Life to open your whole heart to your aunt Selby and me You know how we all dote upon you It is no disgrace for a young woman of virtue to be in love with a worthy man Love is a natural passion  You  have shewn I am sure if ever young creature did shew that you are no giddy no indiscreet person Not Greville with all his gaiety not Fenwick with all his adulation not the more respectable Orme with all his obsequiousness nor yet the imploring Fowler nor the terrifying the shocking Sir Hargrave Pollexfen have seen the least shadow of vanity or weakness in you How happily have you steer'd thro' difficulties in which the love of being admired often involves meaner minds And how have you with mingled dignity and courteousness entitled yourself to the esteem and even veneration of those whom you refused And why refused Not from pride but principle and because you could not love any one of them as you thought you ought to love the man to whom you gave your hand  And at last when the man appeared to you who was worthy of your love who had so powerfully protected you from the lawless attempt of a fierce and cruel pretender a man who proved to be the best of brothers friends landlords masters and the bravest and best of men is it to be wonder'd at that an heart which never before was won should discover sensibility and acknowledge its fellowheartWhat reason then can you have for shame And why seeks my Harriet to draw a curtain between herself and her sympathizing friends You see my dear that we are  above speaking slightly because of our uncertainty of a man that all the world praises Nor are you child so weak as to be treated with such poor policy  You were not educated my dear in artifice Disguises never sat so ill upon any woman as they do in most of your late letters upon you Every child in lovematters would find you out But be it your glory whether our wishes are or are not answered that your affection is laudable that the object of it is not a man mean in understanding profligate in morals nor sordid in degree but such an one as all we your friends are as much in love with as you can be Only my dear Love my Harriet the support of my life and comfort of my evil days endeavour for my sake and for the sake of us all to restrain so far your laudable inclination as that if it be not your happy lot to give us as well as yourself so desirable a blessing you may not suffer in your health an health so precious to me and put yourself on a soot with vulgar girls run away with by their headstrong passions The more desirable the object the nobler the conquest of your passion if it is to be overcome Nevertheless speak out my dear your whole heart to us in order to intitle yourself to our best advice And as to your uncle Selby don't let his raillery pain you He diverts us as well as himself by it He gains nothing over us in the arguments he affects to hold with us And you must know that his whole honest heart is wrapt up in his and our Harriet Worthy man He would not any more than I be able to support his spirits were any misfortune to befal his niece  Your aunt Selby has just now shewn me her letter to you She repeats in it as a very strong expression in yours  "That you had rather converse wish this excellent man but one hour in a week than be the wife of any man you have ever seen or known"  It  is  a strong expression but to me is an expression greatly to your honour since it shews that the  mind  and not the  person  is the principal object of your love  I knew that if ever you did love it would be a love of the purest kind As therefore it has not so much  person  in it as most loves suffer it not to triumph over your reason nor because you cannot have the man you could prefer resolve against having any other Have I not taught you that marriage is a duty whenever it can be enter'd into with prudence What a mean what a selfish mind must that person have whether man or woman who can resolve against entering into the state because it has its cares its fatigues its inconveniencies Try Sir Charles Grandison my dear by this rule If he forbears to marry on such narrow motives this must be one of his great imperfections Nor be afraid to try No man is absolutely perfect  But Sir Charles may have engagements from which he cannot free himself My Harriet I hope will not give way to a passion which is not likely to be returned if she find that to be the case You hope you prettily said in one of your letters  "that you shall not be undone by a  good  man"  After such an escape as you had from Sir Hargrave I have no fear from a  bad  one But my child if you are undone by a good one it must be by your own fault while neither he nor his sisters give you encouragement  I know my dear how these suppositions will hurt your delicacy But then you must doubly guard yourself for the  reality  will be worse wounding to that delicacy than the  supposition  ought to be If there be but one man in the world that can  undo  you will you not guard against him  I long to fold my dearest Harriet to my fond heart But yet this that follows is the advice I give as to the situation you are now in Lose no opportunity of cultivating the friendship of his amiable sisters By the way if Miss Grandison guesses at your mind she is  not so generous in her raillery as is consistent with the rest of her amiable character Never deny them your company when they request it Miss Grandison has promised you the history of their family Exact the performance of that promise from her You will thus come at further lights by which you may be guided in your future stepsIn particular you will find out whether the sisters espouse the interest of any other woman tho' Sir Charles's reservedness even to them may not let them know the secrets of his heart in this particular And if they do not espouse any other person's interest why may they not be made  your  friends my dearAs to fortune could we have any hint what would be expected we would do every thing in our power to make that matter easy and must be content with moderate settlements in your favour  But as I approve of your aunt's having forborn to write as you would have had her to Lady D What shall we do in that affair It will be ask'd  What Why thus Lady D has made it a point that you are disengaged in your affections Your aunt has signified to her that your are You have given that Lady an hint which you say overclouded her brow She will be here on Saturday next Then will she no doubt expect the openest dealingAnd she ought to have it Her own frankness demands it and the character we have hitherto supported and I hope always shall support requires it I would therefore let Lady D know the whole of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen's attempt You my dear was so laudably frank as to  hint  it to her and of the generous protection given you by Sir Charles Grandison Truth never leaves room for selfreproach Let your aunt Selby then own that you had written to her declining with the most respectful gratitude the honour intended you Which she could no otherwise account for than by supposing and indeed believing that you would prefer Sir Charles  Grandison from motives of gratitude to any other man But that you knew nothing of his engagements nor had reason to look upon any part of his behaviour to you but as the effect of his general politeness nor that his sisters meant more by calling you  sister  than their  brother  's sister as well as  theirs  All this shall be mentioned to Lady D in  strict confidence  Then will Lady D know the whole truth She will be enabled as she  ought  to judge for herself You will not appear in her eye as guilty of affectation We shall all act in character If Lady L and Miss Grandison did as you suppose acquaint Lady D that you were not addressed by their brother they will be found to have said the truth and you know my dear that we should be as ready to do justice to others veracity as to our own She will see that your regard for Sir Charles if a regard you have that may be an obstacle to her views is owing to a laudable gratitude for his protection given to a young woman whose heart was  before  absolutely disengaged  And what will be the consequenceWhy either that her Ladyship will think no more of the matter and then you will be just where you were or that she will interest herself in finding out Sir Charles's engagements And as you have communicated to Lady L and Miss Grandison the letters that have passed between Lady D and your aunt together with the contents of yours so far as relates to the proposal and as Lady D is acquainted with those two ladies she will probably inform herself of  their  sentiments in relation to the one affair and the other and the matter on every side by this means will sooner come to a decision than probably it can any other way  I don't know whether I express myself clearly I am not what I was But blessed be God that I am what I am I did not think that in so little a time I could have written so much as I have But my dear Harriet is my subject and her happiness is and has  ever been my only care since I lost the husband of my youth the dear man who divided with me that and all my cares who had a love for you equal to my own and who I think would have given just  such  advice What would Mr Shirley have thought How would he in the like case have acted are the questions I always ask myself before I give my opinion in any material cases especially in those which relate to you  And here let me commend a sentiment of yours that is worthy of your dear grandfather's pupil  "I should despise myself" say you "were I capable of keeping one man in suspense while I was balancing in favour of another"  Good young creature hold fast your principles whatever befalls you Look upon this world as you have been taught to look upon it I have lived to a great age Yet to look backward to the time of my youth when I was not a stranger to the hopes and fears that now agitate you what a short space does it seem to be Nothing withholds my wishes to be released but my desire of seeing the darling of my heart my sweet orphangirl happy in a worthy man's protection O that it could be inBut shall we my dear prescribe to Providence How know we what  that  has designed for Sir Charles Grandison  His  welfare is the concern of hundreds perhaps He compared to us is as the public to the private I hope we are good people  Comparatively  I am sure we are good That however is not the way by which we shall be judged hereafter But yet to him we are but as that private  Don't think however my best Love that I have lived too long to be sensible of what most affects you Of your pleasures your pains I can and do partake Your late harassings so tender so lovely a blossom cost me many a pang and still my eyes bear witness to my sensibility as the cruel scenes are at times read to  me again or as I recall them to memory But all I mean is to arm you against feeling too sensibly when it  is  known the event which is now hidden in the bosom of Providence should it as is but too likely prove unfavourable  You have a great deal of writing upon your hands We cannot dispense with any of that But if you write to your aunt Selby as the time till next Saturday is short that will be writing to us both  God preserve direct and bless my sweet orphanchildThis is the hourly prayer of  Your everaffectionate Grandmother HENRIETTA SHIRLEY  LETTER X Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Mrs  SELBY  Colnebrooke  Tuesday March  I HAVE the favour of yours and of my dear grandmamma's just brought me The contents are so affecting that tho' in full assembly as I may say in this delightful family I begged to be permitted to withdraw to write to them Miss Grandison saw my confusion my puzzle what shall I call it To be charged so home my dear aunt  Such apparent struggles  And were they madam so  very  apparentA  young  a  new passion  And so  visibly increasing  Pray madam if it be  so  it is not at its heightAnd is it not while but in its progress conquerableBut have I been guilty of  affectation  of  reserves  If I have my uncle has been very merciful to the  aukward  girl  And you think it impossible madam but  he  has seen women whom he could love before he saw me Very likely But was it kind to turn the word  gratitude  upon me in such a manner  I do see what an amiable openness of heart there is  in Lady D I admire her for it and for her other matronly qualities What can  you  do madam What can  I  do That is the question called upon as I am by my grandmamma as well as by you to speak still plainer plain as in your opinion I  had  spoken and indeed in my own now I read the free sentence drawn out and separated from the rest of the letter My grandmamma forgives and even praises me for this sentence She encourages me to speak still plainer It is no disgrace she says for a woman of virtue to be in Love with a worthy man Love is a natural passion she tells me Yet cautions me against suffering it to triumph over my reason in short not to love till there shall be a certainty of returnAnd so I can love  as I will when  I will nay  whom  I will for if  he  won't have me I am desired not to resolve against marrying some other Lord D for example if  he  will be so good as to have me  Well but upon a full examination of my heart how do I find it now I am called upon by my two most venerable friends to  undraw the curtain  and to  put off the disguises  through which every  child in lovematters  finds me out Shall I speak my whole heartTo such  sympathizing  friends surely I ought Well then I own to you my honour'd grandmamma and aunt that I cannot think of encouraging any other address Yet have I no hope I look upon myself as presumptuous Upon him as too excellent and too considerable for he has a great estate and still greater expectations And as to personal and intellectual merit what woman can deserve himEven in the article of fortune only you think that in prudence a man so munificent should look higher  Be pleased therefore madam in conformity to my grandmamma's advice to tell Lady D from me  'That I think her laudable openness deserves like openness That your Harriet  was  disengaged in her affections absolutely disengaged when you told her  that she was Tell her what afterwards happened Tell her how my  gratitude  engaged me That at first it was no more but that now being called upon on this occasion I have owned my gratitude exalted'  It may not I hope be said  debased  the object so worthy 'intoLove'Yes say  Love  since  I  act too  aukwardly  in the  disguises  I have assumed  'That therefore I can no more in  justice  than by  inclination  think of any other man And own to her that her Ladyship has however engaged my respectful Love even to reverence by her goodness to me in the visit she honour'd me with and that for her sake I could have given ear to this proposal preferably to any other that had yet been made me had I seen nothing objectable in Lord D upon an interview and further acquaintance'  And yet I own to you my venerable friends that I always think of Mr Orme with grateful pity for his humble for his modest perseverance What would I give to see Mr Orme married to some very worthy woman in whom he could be happy  Finally bespeak for me her Ladyship's favour and friendship but  not  to be renewed till my Lord is marriedAnd may his nuptials be as happy as wished to be by a mother so worthy But tell her at the same time that I would not for twelve times my Lord's  l  a year give my hand to him or to any man while another had a place in my heart however unlikely it is that I may be called by the name of the man I prefer  But tell Lady D all this in confidence in the strictest confidence among more general reasons regarding the delicacy of our sex for fear the family I am with who now love should hate and what would be still worse despise your Harriet for her presumptionI think I could not bear thatDon't mind this great blotForgive itIt  would  fallMy pen found it before I saw it  As to myself whatever be my lot I will endeavour to reap consolation from these and other passages in the two precious letters before me  "If you love be not ashamed to own it to  us  The man is Sir Charles Grandison"  "Love is a natural passion"  "Mine is laudable The object of it is a man not mean in understanding nor profligate in morals nor sordid in degree All my friends are in Love with him as well as I"  "My Love is a Love of the purest kind"  "And I ought to acquiesce because our Love of him is but as as the Love of private compared to the Love of public"  Noble instructions my dearest two mamma's to which I will endeavour to give their full weight  And now let me take it a little unkindly that you call me your  orphangirl  You two and my honoured uncle have supplied all wanting relations to me My father then my grandmamma and my other mamma continue to pray for and to bless not your orphan but your real daughter in all love and reverence  HARRIET BYRONSHIRLEYSELBY  LETTER XI Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  LUCY SELBY  Colnebrooke  Tuesday March  HERE I am my dear Lucy returned to this happy asylum But with what different emotions from the first time I enter'd it How did my heart flutter when one of Sir Charles's servants who attended us on horseback pointed out to us at the command of the Ladies the very spot where the two chariots met and the contest began The recollection pained me Yet  do I not owe to that terrifying incident the friendship I am admitted into with so amiable a family  Miss Grandison ever obliging has indulged me in my choice of having a room to myself I shall have the more leisure for writing to you my dear friends  Both she and Lady L are very urgent with me to shew them some of the letters in our correspondence and Miss Grandison says if that will encourage me to oblige them they will shew me some of their brother'sWho would not be tempted by such an exchange I am more than halfafraidBut surely in such an heap of stuff as I have written there is something that I can  read  to them Shall I be permitted do you think to have my letters returned me for this purpose The remarks of these Ladies on what I shall think fit to shew them will be of great use in helping to settle my judgment I know I have thrown out many things at random and being a young creature and not passed the  age of fancy  have in all those sentiments which are not borrowed been very superficial How can it be otherwise  The conversation in the coach turned upon their own family for I put in my claim to Miss Grandison's former promise on that head from which I gather'd the following particulars  Sir Thomas Grandison was one of the handsomest men of his time He had a great notion of magnificence in living and went deep into all the fashionable diversions except gaming with cards and dice tho' he ran into one as expensive but which he called a nobler vice valuing himself upon his breed of racehorses and hunters and upon his kennel in both which articles he was extravagant to profusion  His  father Sir Charles was as frugal as Sir Thomas was profuse He was a purchaser all his life and left his son besides an estate of  l  a year in England and near  l  a year in Ireland rich in money  His Lady was of a noble family sister to Lord W  She was as you have already been told the most excellent of women I was delighted to see her two daughters bear testimony to her goodness and to their own worth by their tears It was impossible in the character of so good a woman not to think of my own mamma and I could not help on the remembrance joining my tears with theirs  Miss Jervois also wept not only from tenderness of nature and sympathy but as she owned from regret that she had not the same reason to rejoice in a living mother as we had to remember affectionately the departed  What I have written and shall farther write to the disadvantage of Sir Thomas Grandison I gather'd from what was dropt by one Lady and by the other at different times for it was beautiful to observe with what hesitation and reluctancy they mentioned any of his failings with what pleasure his good qualities heightening the one and extenuating the other O my Lucy how would their hearts have overflowed in his praises had they had such a faultless father and excellent man as was my father Sweet is the remembrance of good parents to good children  Lady Grandison brought a great fortune to Sir Thomas He had a fine poetical vein which he was fond of cultivating Tho' his fortune was so ample it was his person and his verses that won the Lady from several competitors He had not however  her  judgment He was a poet and I have heard my grandfather say that to be a poet requires an heated imagination which often runs away with the judgment  This Lady took the consent of all her friends in her choice but here seemed an hint to drop from Lady L that they consented  because  it was her choice for Sir Thomas from the day he enter'd upon his estate set out in a way that everybody concluded would diminish it  He made however a  kind  husband as it is called  His goodsense and his politeness and the pride he took to be thought one of the bestbred men in England secured her  complaisant  treatment But Lady Grandison had qualities that deserved one of the best and tenderest of men Her eye and her ear had certainly misled her I believe a woman who chooses a man whom everybody admires if the man be not good must expect that he will have calls and inclinations that will make him think the character of a domestic man beneath him  She endeavoured at setting out to engage his  companionableness  shall I call it She was fond of her husband He had reason to be and  was  proud of his wife But when he had shew'd her everywhere and she began to find herself in circumstances which ought to domesticate a wife of a much gayer turn than Lady Grandison pretended to have he gave way to his predominant byass and after a while leaving the whole familycare to her for her excellence in every branch of which he was continually praising her He did her that justice he was but little at home in the summer and in the winter was generally engaged four months in the diversions of this great town and was the common patron of all the performers whether at plays operas or concerts  At first setting out in this way he was solicitous to carry his Lady with him to town She always chearfully accepted of his invitation when she saw he was urgent with her to go She would not give a pretence for so gay a man to throw off that regard to appearances which pride made him willing to keep up But afterwards his invitations growing fainter and fainter and she finding that her presence lengthened the time of his stay in town and added greatly to his expences for he never would abate when they were together of that magnificence in which he delighted to live in the country she declined going up And having by this time her three children she found it was  as agreeable to Sir Thomas as to herself that she should turn her thoughts wholly to the domestic duties Lady Grandison when she found that she could not bring Sir Thomas to lessen his great expences supposed it to be wisdom to endeavour to the utmost of her power to enable him to support them without discredit to himself or visible hurt to his family The children were young and were not likely to make demands upon him for many years to come  Here was a mother my dear Who will say that mothers may not be the  most  useful persons in the family when they do their duty and their husbands are defective in theirs Sir Thomas Grandison's delights centred in himself Lady Grandison's in her husband and children What a superiority what an inferiority  Yet had this Lady with the best oeconomy no narrowness in her heart She was beloved for her generosity and benevolence Her poor neighbours adored her Her table was plenteous She was hospitable as well from the largeness of her own heart as to give credit to her busband and so far to accommodate herself to his taste as that too great a difference might not be seen between his absence and presence As occasions offer'd she would confer benefits in the name of an husband whom perhaps she had not seen of months and knew not whether she might see for months to come She was satisfied tho' hers was the  first  merit with the  second  merit reflected from that she gave him  "I am but Sir Thomas's almoner I know I shall please Sir Thomas by doing this Sir Thomas would have done thus Perhaps he would have been more bountiful had he been present"  He had been once absent from this admirable wife six whole months when he left her but for one He designed only an excursion to Paris when he set out but when in company as gay as himself while he was there he extended his tour and what was still more  inexcusable he let his Lady hear from him by secondhand only He never wrote one line to her with his own yet on his return affected to surprise her by a sudden appearance when she knew not that he was in England  Was not this intollerably vain in him The moment he appeared so secure was he of his Lady's unmerited Love that he supposed the joy she would break out into would banish from her thoughts all memory of his past unkindness  He ask'd her however after the first emotions for she received him with real joy If she could easily forgive himForgive you SirYes if you can forgive yourself  This he called severe Well he might for it was just Lady Grandison's goodness was founded in principle not in tameness or servility  Be not serious Sir Thomas said my Lady and flung her arms about him You know by your question you were unkind Not one line from your own hand neitherBut the seeing you now safe and well compensates me for all the anxieties you have given me in the past six tedious monthsCan I say they were not anxious ones But I pity you Sir for the pleasure you have lost by so long an absence Let me lead you to the nursery or let the dear prattlers come down to receive their father's blessing How delightful is their dawning reason Their improvements exceed my hopes Of what pleasure do you deprive yourself by these long absences  My dear Miss Grandison let me write on I am upon a sweet subject Why will you tear me from it Who Lucy would not almost wish to be the wife the halfslighted wife of a gay Sir Thomas to be a Lady Grandison  One reflexion my dear Miss Grandison let me make before I attend you left I should lose it What man who now at one view takes in the whole gay  fluttering life of Sir Thomas Grandison tho' young gay and flutterring himself can propose to be more happy than Sir Thomas thought himself What woman who in like manner can take in the whole useful prudent serene benevolent life of Lady Grandison whatever turn to pleasure less solid and more airy she may have sees not from this imperfect sketch all that they should wish to be and the transitory vanity of the one and the solid happiness that must attend the other as well here as hereafter  Dear Ladyhad you not hurried me so how much better should I have expressed myself  I come I come  LETTER XII Miss  BYRON  In continuation  MISS Grandison has been making me read aloud some part of the letter I had just writ to you Lucy We know said she it is about  us  but we shall think what you have written greatly to our disadvantage if we cannot hear some of it Then she insisted she is an arbitrary dear creature on my giving the company It was at tea and Lord L present such histories as she should call for of my own family On this condition only said she will we consent to be made fully known as I find we shall if I do not steal away your pen and ink to  our  grandmother Shirley  our  aunt Selby and even to  our  Lucy  Do not you think Lucy I ran on with pleasure in describing the persons and tempers of my father and mother and relating their fortunes loves difficulties as my grandmamma and aunt had enabled me to do from what they used to recount in many a long summerday and in many a winterevening as we girls sat at workHappy memorialsAy but do  you believe she did not question me about later events She did indeed call upon me for two other histories  And of whom methinks you ask  I won't tell  you  Lucy But if my  aunt  should be solicitous to know and should  guess  that my uncle's and hers so entertaining and instructive was one of them and if you Lucy should  guess  that the history of a young lady whose discretion got the better of her Love and who cannot be dearer to herself than she is to me is the otherWhy perhaps neither my aunt nor you my dear may be much mistaken  Methinks I would fain rise nowandthen to my former  serenepertness  Allow you of the words so connected But my heart is heavy  They were delighted with a certain gentleman's humourous character and courtship with his lady's prudence and goodness in the one story and in the other with the young Lady's victorious discretion They wish to be personally acquainted with each and with my grandmamma  All  the worthies in the world my dear are not in the Grandisonfamily  BEFORE I resume the continuation of the Ladies familyhistory let me ask Don't you think my dear that God has blessed these happy children for the sake of their excellent mother And who knows but for their duty to their lessdeserving father It is my notion that one person's remissness in duty where there is a reciprocal one does not absolve the other party from the performance of his It is difficult indeed to love so well a faulty or remiss parent as a kind and good one But our duty is indispensable and where it is paid a blessing may the rather be expected as the parent has not done his If  when you do well and suffer for it  says the Apostle  ye take it patiently this is acceptable with God  Not to mention one consideration which however ought not to be left out of the account that a good child will be no  less benefitted by the  warning  as Sir Charles no doubt is from his father's unhappy turn than by the  example  as he is from that of his excellent mother  Lady L referred to the paper given in by the shorthand writer for the occasion as mentioned by Sir Charles to which these three worthy Children owed the loss of such a mother  Letter IV p  And this drew her into a melancholy relation of some very affecting particulars Among other things she said her mother regretted in her last hours that she had no opportunity that she could think just and honourable to lay by any thing considerable for her daughters Her jewels and some valuable trinkets she hoped would be theirs But that would be at their father's pleasure I wish said she that my dear girls were to have between them the tenth part of what I have savedBut I have done but my duty  I have told you Charlotte said the Countess what my mother said to me a few hours before she died and I will repeat it to Miss Byron After having upon general principles recommended filial duty and brotherly and sisterly love to us all and after my brother and sister had withdrawn My dear Careline said she let me add to the general arguments of the duty I have been enforcing upon you all one respecting your  interest  and let your sister know it I am afraid there will be but a slender provision made for my dear girls Your papa has the notion rivesed in him which is common to men of antient families that daughters are but incumbrances and that the son is to be everything He loves his girls He loves you dearly But he has often declared that were he to have entire all the fortune that descended to him from his father be would not give to his daughters marry whom they would more than  l  apiece Your brother loves you He loves me It will be in  his  power should he  survive your father to be a good friend to youLove your brother  To my brother afterwards she said something I believe recommending his sisters to him for we coming in boy as he was in years but man in behaviour and understanding he took each of our handsYou remember it Charlotte Both sisters wept and kneeling down and putting them in my mother's heldout dying hands and bowing his face upon all threeAll madamAll my dearest best of mamma's that you have enjoin'd  He could say no more and our arms were wet with with his tearsEnough enough my son I distress youAnd she kissed her own armThese are precious tears You embalm me my son with your tearsO how precious the balmAnd she lifted up her head to kiss his cheek and to repeat her blessings to the darling of her heart  Who could refrain tears my Lucy on the representation of such a sceneMiss Jervois and I wept as if we had been present on the solemn occasion  But my Charlotte give Miss Byron some brief account of the parting scene between my father and mother She is affected as a sister should beTears when time has matured a pungent grief into a sweet melancholy are not hurtful They are as the dew of the morning to the green herbage  I cannot said Miss GrandisonDo  you  Lady L  Lady L proceededMy father had long kept his chamber from the unhappy adventure which cost him and us all so dear My mother till she was forced to take to her bed was constantly his attendant And  then  was grieved she could not attend him still  At last the moment happy to her long dreaded by us the releasing moment approached One last long farewel she wish'd to take of the man who had been  ever  dear to her and who had cost her  so  dear He was told of her desire to be lifted to his bedside in  her bed for one of his wounds too soon skinned over was broken out and he was confined to his bedHe ordered himself to be carried in a great chair to hers But then followed  such  a scene  All we three children were in the room kneeling by the bedsideprayingweepingO how ineffectuallyNot even hope remainingBest beloved of my soul in faltering accents said my mother her head raised by pillows so as that she sat uprightForgive the desire of my heart once more to see youThey would not bring me to  you  O how I distress youFor my father sobbed every feature of his face seem'd swelled almost to bursting and working as if in mortal agoniesCharlotte relieve me  The sweet Lady's eyes were drowned in tears  I cannot said Miss Grandison her handkerchief spread over her face  Miss Emily sobbed She held her hand before her eyes Her tears trickled through her fingers  I was affected beyond measureYet besought her Ladyship to proceedShe went on  I have endeavour'd said my mother in broken sentencesIt was my wishIt was my pride Indeed my chiefest pride to be a good wise  O my dearYou  have  beenMy father could not say what  Forgive my imperfections Sir  O my dearest life You had no imperfections I I was all imperHe could not speak out the word for his tears  Bless your children in my sight God hitherto has blessed them God will continue to bless them if they continue to deserve their father's blessing Dear Sir Thomas as you love them bless them in my sight I doubt not your goodness to themBut the blessing of a dying mother joined with that of a surviving fathermust have efficary  My father looked earnestly to us allHe could not speak  By brother following my mother's dying eye which was cast upon my father arose from his knees and approaching my father's chair cast himself at his feet My father threw his arms about his neckGod blessGod bless my son said heand make him a better man than his father My mother demanding the cheek of her beloved son said God bless my dearest child and make you an honour to your father's family and to your mother's memory  We girls followed my brother's example  God bless my daughtersGod bless you sweet Loves said my father first kissing one then the other as we kneeledGod make you as good women as your mother Then then will you deserve to be happy  God bless you my dear girls God bless you both said my mother kissing each as you are dutiful to your father and as you love one anotherI hope I have given you no bad example  My father began to accuse himself My brother with the piety of the patriarch's two best sons retired that he might not hear his father's confession We followed him to the farther end of the room The manly youth sat down between us and held an hand of each between his His noble heart was soften'd He two or three times listed the hand of each to his lips But he could only once speak his heart seeming ready to burst and that was as I remember O my sistersComfort yourselvesBut who can say comfortThese tears are equally our duty and our relief  My mother retained to the last that generosity of mind which had ever distinguished her She would not permit my father to proceed with his self▪accusation Let us look forward my dearest my only Love said she I have a blessed hope before me I pity as well  as pray for survivors You are a man of sense Sir and of enlarged sentiments God direct you according to them and comfort you All my fear was and that more particularly for some of the last past months that I should have been the mournful survivor In a very few moments all my sufferings will be over and God give you when you come to this unavoidable period of all human vanity the same happy prospects that are now opening to me O Sir believe me all worldly joys are now nothing less than nothing Even my love of you and of the dear piedges of our mutual Love withholds not now my wishes after an happier state There may we meet and never be separatedForgive me only my beloved husband if I have ever made you for one hour unhappy or uneasyForgive the petulancies of my Love  Who can bear this goodness said my father I have not deserved  Dear Sir no moreWere you not the husband of my choiceAnd now your grief affects meLeave me Sir You bring me back again to earthGod preserve you watch over you  heal  you support you Your hand Sir Thomas Grandison the name that was ever so pleasant in my ears Your hand Sir Your heart was my treasure I have now and only now a better treasure a diviner Love in view▪ Adieu and in this world for ever adieu my husband my friend my Grandison  She turned her head from him sunk upon her pillows and fainted and so saw not had not the  grief  to see the stronger heart of my father overcome for he fainted away and was carried out in his chair by the servants who brought him in He was in a strong convulsionfit between his not halfcured wounds and his grief and recover'd not till all was over with my blessed mother  After my father was carried out she came to herself Her chaplain was once more admitted The  fatal moment approached She was asked if she would see her children again No she said but bid her last blessing be repeated to them and her charge of  loving one another  in the words of our Saviour as  she had loved us  And when the chaplain came to read a text which she had imperfectly pointed to but so as to be understood she repeated in faltering accents but with more strength of voice than she had had for an hour before  I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faithThere is laid up for me a crown of righteousness  And then her voice failing she gave signs of satisfaction in the hope of being entitled to that crown and expired in an ejaculation that her ebbing life could not support  O my Lucy may my latter end and the latter end of all I love be like hers The two Ladies were in speechless tears so was Miss Jervois so was I for some minutes And for an hour or two all the joys of life were as nothing to me Even the regard I had entertained for the excellent son of a Lady  so  excellent my protector my deliverer had for some hours subsided and was as nothing to me Even now that I have concluded this moving recapitulation it seems as nothing and the whole world my dear is as a bit of dirt under my feet  LETTER XIII Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  THE son was inconsolable upon his mother's death He loved his father but next to adored his mother His father tho' he had given so little attention to his education was excessively fond of him And no doubt but he the more easily satisfied himself on this head as he knew his remissness was so well supplied by his lady's care which mingled with the cares of the masters of the several sciences who came home to him at her desire  A deep melancholy having seized the young gentleman on a loss so irreparable his father who himself was greatly grieved and the more as he could not but reproach himself as having at least hasten'd that loss was alarmed for his son and yielded to the entreaties of General W brother of Lord W to permit him to travel The General recommended for a governor to the young gentleman an officer under him who had been wounded and obliged to quit the military service Sir Thomas allowed his son  l  a year from the day of his setting out on his travels which he augmented afterwards to  l  Sir Charles was about seventeen when his mother died  The two daughters were taken by Lady W But she dying in about twelvemonths after Lady Grandison they returned to their father who by that time had pretty well got over his grief for the loss of his Lady and was quite recovered of the wounds which he received in the duel that cost her her life  He plac'd over his daughters as governess though they both took exceptions at that title supposing themselves of age to manage for themselves the widow of one of his gay friends Oldham by name whose fortune had not held out as Sir Thomas's had done Men of strong health I have heard my grandfather say and of a riotous turn should not in mere  compassion  keep company with men of feebler constitutions and make them the companions of their riots So may one say I believe that extravagant men of great and small fortunes are equally illsuited since the expences which will but shake the one will quite demolish the other  Mrs Oldham had fine qualities and was an oeconomist She deserved a better husband than had fallen to her lot and the young Ladies having had a foundation laid by a still more excellent manager received no small advantage from her skill in family affairs But it was related to me with reluctance and  as what I must know on a further acquaintance with their family if they did not tell it to me that Sir Thomas was grateful to this Lady in a way that cost her her reputation She was obliged in short in little more than a twelvemonth to quit the country and to come up to town She had an indisposition which kept her from going abroad for a month or two  Lady L being then about nineteen and Miss Grandison about sixteen they had spirit enough to oppose the return of this Lady to her charge They undertook themselves to manage everything at the capital seat in Hampshire  Sir Thomas had another seat in Essey Thither on the reluctance of the young Ladies to receive again Mrs Oldham he carried her and they as well as everybody else for some time apprehended they were actually married She was handsome well descended and tho' she became so unhappily sensible of the favours and presents by which Sir Thomas made way to her heart she had an untainted character when he took her as a governess to the young Ladies  Was not Sir Thomas very very faulty with regard to this poor womanShe had already suffered enough from a bad husband to whom she remarkably well perform'd her dutyPoor womanThe example to his own daughters was an abominable one She was the relict of his friend She was under his protection Thrown into it by her unhappy circumstancesWere not these great aggravations to his crime Happy for those parents who live not to see such catastrophes as attended this child This darling it seems Not undeservedly so and whom they thought they had not unhappily married to Mr OldhamAnd he poor man thought himself not unhappy in Sir Thomas Grandison's acquaintance tho' it ended in his emulating him in his expences with a  much less estate in the ruin of his fortune which indeed was his own fault and in the ruin of his wife's virtue which was more Sir Thomas's than hersMay I say soIf I may not since women whose glory is their chastity must not yield to temptation had not the husband however something to answer for who with his eyes open lived at such a rate against his wife's dutiful remonstrances and better example as reduced her after his death to the necessity of dependence on another's favour and  such  another  Sir Thomas was greatly displeased with his daughters for resisting him in the return of their governess He had thought the reason of her withdrawing a secret because he wish'd it to be one And yet her disgrace was at the time everywhere talked of but in his presence  This woman is still living She has two children by Sir Thomas who are also living and one by Mr Oldham I shall be told more of her history when the Ladies come to give me some account of their brother's  Sir Thomas went on in the same gay fluttering way that he had done all his life The Love of  pleasure  as it is called was wrought into his habit He was a  sl  ve  to it and to what he called  freedom  He was deemed one of the best companions among men and one of the gallantest men among women His advantages of person and mind were snares to him Mrs Oldham was not the only one of her sex with whom he was intimate He had another mistress in town who had a taste for all its gaieties and who even assumed his name  He would rowand then by way of excursion and to surprise the young Ladies visit Grandisonhall but tho' it was once the seat he most delighted in neither gave nor seamed to receive much pleasure there hurrying away on a sudden as if he had escaped from  it tho' never father had more reason to be pleased with the conduct and duty of daughters And this he often declared boasting of them in their absence but snubbing chiding and studying to find fault with them when present  But what equally surprised and affected them was that his son had not been a year abroad when he prohibited them to write to or correspond with him and by their brother's discontinuing to write to them from about the same time they supposed that he was under the same prohibition And so it seems he was  They presumed their father's reason for this unkind prohibition was his fear that his gaieties would have been one of the subjects of the correspondence and the rather as those gaieties were so likely to affect all three in their fortunes  The young Ladies however for some time continued writing to their brother Miss Grandison in mentioning this said in her ususal sprightly manner that she never had any notion of obeying unreasonable commands commands so evidently unreasonable as to be unnatural And she called upon me to justify her in her notion The Countess also desired me to speak my mind on this subject  I am apprehensive said I of children's  partiality  in this respect If they make themselves their own judges in the performance or nonperformance of a duty  inclination  I am afraid will too often be their guide rather than right reason They will be too apt perhaps to call those commands unnatural which are not so unnatural as this seems to be  But Harriet asked Miss Grandison would not you have written on in the like circumstances  I believe not replied I and partly for this reason because I should have had no doubt but my brother would have the same prohibition and I should only have shewn my brother as well as my father were  my father to know it an instance of my refractorines  without obtaining the desired end or if my br  er had written I should have made him a part  er in my fault  Your  ower regards the policy of the thing Harriet said Miss Grandison But ought an unnatural command  There she stopt Yet by her looks expected me to speak  I should have thought it hard but that it was more meritorious to submit than the contrary I believe I should have supposed that my father might have reasons which might not appear to me But pray Ladies how did your brother  O he was implicit  Will you forgive me ladiesI should have been concerned I think that my brother in a point of duty tho' it were one that might be  disputable  should be more  nice  more  delicate  than I his sister  Miss Emily looked as if she were pleased with me  Well you are a good girl a very good girl said Miss Grandison  That  whether your doctrine be just or not is out of dispute  This prohibition gave the sisters the more sensible concern as they were afraid it would lay a foundation for distance and indifference in their brother to them on whom as their mother had presaged they were likely if he survived their father to have a too great dependence but more particularly at that time as their brother had promised at his taking leave of them to write a regular account of all that befel him and of all that was curious and worthy notice in the courts and places he visited and had actually begun to do so and as he had asked their advice in relation to his governor who proved not so proper a person for that employment as was expected and to which they had answered without knowing for some time what was the resolution he took  They asked their father from time to time after the welfare of their brother He would answer them with pleasure and sometimes with tears in his eyes He is all that is  dutiful brave pious worthy  And would sometimes add  God reward him  I  cannot  But when he mentioned the word  dutiful  he would look at them as if he had in his thoughts their resisting him in his intention of reinstating their governess the only time they could recollect that they had given him the shadow of displeasure  The Ladies went on and said that Sir Thomas in all companies gloried in his son And once Lord W who himself on his Lady's death openly indulged himself in liberties which before he was only suspected to take O my Lucy how rare a character in this age is that of a virtuous man told some gentlemen who wonder'd that Sir Thomas Grandison could permit a son so beloved to be absent from him so many years that the reason Sir Thomas gave was that his son's morals and his own were so different that he should not be able to bear his own consciousness if he consented to his return to England The unhappy man was so habituated to vice that he could talk familiarly of his gaieties to his intimates seeming to think them too well known for him to endeavour to conceal them but however would add sometimes I intend to set about altering my course of life and then will I send for my son But alas Sir Thomas went on from year to year only  intending  He lived not to begin the promised  alteration  nor to see his son  Yet one awakener he had that made him talk of beginning the alteration of his way of living out of hand and of sending for his son which last act was to be the forerunner of his reformation  It happen'd that Mrs Farnborough the woman he lived with when in town was struck with the smallpox in the height of her gaiety and pleasure for she  was taken ill at the opera on seeing a Lady of her acquaintance there whose face bore too strongly the marks of the distemper and who it seems had made her first visit to that place rather than to a better The malady aided by her terror proved mortal and Sir Thomas was so much affected with the warning that he left town and in pursuance of his temporary good resolutions went down to his daughters talked of sending for his son and for some few months lived like the man of sense and understanding he was known to be  LETTER XIV Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  LORD L returned from his travels about the time that Mrs Farnborough was taken ill He had brought some presents to Sir Thomas from his son who took all opportunities to send him over curiosities some of considerable value which served at the same time to shew his oeconomy and his duty He forgot not in this way his sisters tho' his accompanying letters were short and merely polite and such as required no other answer than thanks Only they could discover by them that he had warm wishes to be allowed to return to England but such a submission to his father's pleasure as entirely to give up his own  Sir Thomas seemed fond of Lord L And setting out on Mrs Farnborough's death for Grandisonhall gave him an invitation to visit him there for he would listen with pleasure an hour together to him or to any one who would talk and give him some account of his son How predominant must those passions those habits be in his heart which could take place of a Love so laudably paternal  In pursuance of this invitation Lord L attended  him at the Hall and there fell in Love with the eldest of the young Ladies He revealed his passion to her She referred herself wholly to her father Sir Thomas could not be blind to their mutual affection Everybody saw it Lord L's passion was of the ardent kind and he was too honest to wish to conceal it But yet Sir Thomas would not see it He behaved however with great freedom and civility to my Lord so that the heart of the young Lady was insensibly engaged but he avoided several opportunities which the Lover had lain in wait for to open his mind and make proposals  At last my Lord desired an audience of Sir Thomas as upon a subject of the last importance The Baronet after some little delays and not without some inauspicious reluctance granted it And then my Lord revealed his passion to him  Sir Thomas asked him if he had made it known to his daughter And yet must have seen on an hundred occasions at breakfast at dinner at tea at supper how matters stood with both the Lovers if Miss Grandison's pleasant account of the matter may be depended upon  Lord L owned he had and that he had asked her leave to make proposals to her father to whom she wholly referred herself  Sir Thomas seemed uneasy and oddly answer'd he was sorry for it He wish'd his Lordship had not put such notions in the girl's head Both his daughters would now be set a romancing he supposed They were till now modest young creatures he said Young women should not too soon be set to look out of themselves for happinessHe had known many quiet and orderly girls set a madding by the notice of men He did not know what business young fellows had to find out qualifications in other mens daughters that the parents of those daughters had not given themselves leisure to discover A daughter of  his  he hoped had not encouraged such discoveries It was to him but as  yesterday  when they were crowing in the arms of their nurses and now he supposed they would be set a crowing after wedlock  What an  odd  father was Sir Thomas my LucyHis own life it is evident had passed away very pleasantly  Indeed he could hardly bear to think he added of either of his daughters as marriagaeble yet They have not been nursed in the town hotbeds my Lord They are sober countrygirls and good housewives I love not that girls should marry before they have done growing A young wife makes a vapourish mother I forget their ageBut twentysix or twentyeight is time enough for a woman either for the sake of modesty or discretion to marry  We may like  gay  men for  husbands  my dear Some of us do But at this rate those daughters must be very good girls who can make their best courtesies to their mothers and thank them for their  fancies  or the fathers must be more attentive to their growth than Sir Thomas was to that of his daughtersWhat have I saidI am here afraid of my uncle  My Lord was surprised and well he might Sir Thomas had forgot as Lady L observed that he himself thought Miss  W  was not too young at seventeen to be  Lady Grandison  My Lord was a modest Man He was begging as it may be called the young woman whom of all the women in the world he loved best of her father who was a man that knew the world and had long made a considerable figure in it and who for reasons which would have held with him had he lived to see her  forty  had no mind to part with her Yet my Lord pleaded his passion her great and good qualities as acknowledged by himself and modestly hinted at the unexceptionableness of his own character and the favour he stood in with his son not saying the least  word of his birth and alliances which some Lovers of his rank would not have forgot And it seems he was right in forbearing to make these accidents a plea for Sir Thomas valued himself upon his ancestry and used to say that his progenitor in James the First's time disgraced it by accepting the title of Baronet  Sir Thomas allowed something to the plea of his standing well with his son Let me tell you my Lord said he that I shall take no step in a familyaffair of this consequence without consulting with my son and the rather as he is far from expecting so much of my consideration for him He is the pride of my life  My Lord desired that his suit might be put upon the issue of his son's approbation  But pray my Lord what fortune do you expect with my girl Well as you love her I suppose the return of her Love for yours which you seem not to doubt will not be enough Can the poor girl be a Countess without a confounded parcel of dross fasten'd to her petticoat to make her weight in the other scale  My circumstances said my honest Lord L permit me not in discretion to make that compliment to my Love which my heart would with transport make were they better But I will lay them faithfully before you and be determined by your generosity  I could not but expect from a young man of your Lordship's goodsense such an answer as this And yet I must tell you that we fathers who know the world expect to make some advantage of a knowledge that has cost us so much I should not dislike a little more romancing in Love from a man that asks for my daughter tho' I care not how little of it is shewn by my son to another man's Every father  thinks  thus my Lord but is not so honest as to  own  it  I am sure Sir Thomas that you would not think a man worthy of your daughter who had no regard to  anything but the gratification of his own wishes who could think for the sake of that of involving a young Lady in difficulties which she never knew in her father's house  Why this my Lord is well said You and I may afford to make handsome compliments to one another while compliments only are expected I have a good share of health I have not quitted the world so entirely nor think I ought as to look upon myself as the necessary tool of my children to promote their happiness at the expence of my own My Lord I have still a strong relish for the pleasures of this world My daughters  may  be women grown Your Lordship seems to have  found out  that they  are  and has persuaded one of them that she  is  and the other will be ready to think she is not three years behind her This is an inconvenience which you have brought upon me And as I would be glad to live a little longer for myself I wish you to withdraw your suit and leave me to do as well as I  can  with my daughters I propose to carry them to town next winter They shall there look about them and see whom they could like and who could like them that they may not be liable to afterrepentance for having taken the first man that offer'd  My Lord told Sir Thomas that he hoped there could not be reason to imagine that anything could possibly arise from his address that should be incompatible with the happiness of a fatherAnd was going on in the same reasonable strain but Sir Thomas interrupted him  You must not my Lord suppose I can be a stranger to whatever may be urged by a young man on this subject You say you are in Love Caroline is a girl that anybody may love But I have not a mind she should marry so soon I know the inconvenience of early marriages A man's children treading upon his heels and  shouldering him  with their shoulders In  short my Lord I have an aversion to be called a grandfather before I am a  grey  father Sir Thomas was not put to it to try to overcome this aversion Girls will start up and look up and parents cannot help it But what father in the vigour of his days would not  wish  to help it I am not fond of their partnership in my substance Why should I divide my fortune with novices when making the handsome allowances to them that I do make it is not too much for myself My son should be their example He is within a year as old as my eldest girl On his future alliances I build and hope to add by them to the consequence of all my family Ah Lucy Girls are said to be women sooner than boys are men Let us see that they are so by their discretion as well as by statureLet them stay  And here Sir Thomas abruptly broke off the conversation for that time to the great distress of Lord L who had reason to regret that he had a man of wit rather than a man of reason to contend with  Sir Thomas went directly into his closet and sent for his two daughters and tho' not illnaturedly rallied t em both so much on their own  discoveries  as he wickedly phrased it and on admitting Lord L into the secret that neither of them could hold up their heads for two or three days  in  his presence But  out  of it Miss Caroline Grandison found that she was in Love and the more for Lord L's generous attachment and Sir Thomas's not so generous discouragement  My Lord wrote over to young Mr Grandison to favour his address Lady L permitted me to copy the following answer to his Application  My Lord  I HAVE the honour of your Lordship's letter of the th Never brother loved his sisters better than I do mine As the natural effects of that Love  I receive with pleasure the notification of your great regard for my elder sister As to myself I cannot have one objection But what am I in this case She is wholly my father's I also am his The consideration he gives me in this instance confounds me It binds me to him in double duty It would look like taking advantage of it were I so much as to offer my humble opinion unless he were pleased to command it from me If he does assure yourself my Lord that my sister's inclination in your Lordship's favour presupposed my voice shall be warmly given as you wish I am my Lord with equal affection and esteem  Your Lordship's faithful and obedient Servant  Both sisters rejoiced at the perusal of this affectionate letter for they were afraid that the unnatural prohibition of correspondence between them and their brother had estranged his affections from them  The particulars of one more conversation I will give you between my Lord and Sir Thomas on this important subject for you must believe Lord L could not permit a matter of such consequence to his own happiness to go easily off especially as neither of the two daughters were able to stand their father's continual raillery which had banished from the cautious eyes and apprehensive countenances of both Ladies all indications of Love tho' it reigned with the more absolute power in the heart of Miss Caroline for that concealment  In this conversation my Lord began with a little more spirit than he finished the former The Countess lent me my Lord's minutes of it which he took for her to see and to judge of all that passed at the time  On my Lord's lively but respectful address to Sir Thomas on the occasion the Baronet went directly into the circumstances of my Lord and his expectations  Lord L told him frankly that he paid interest for  l  for sisters fortunes three of whom were living and single That he believed two of them would soon be advantageously married and he should wish to pay them their portions on the day and was contriving to do so by increasing the incumbrance that his father had left upon the finest part of his estate to the amount of  l  which and his sisters fortunes were all that lay upon a clear estate of  l  a year After he had thus opened himself he referred the whole to Sir Thomas's consideration  My advice my Lord is this said the Baronet That you should by no means think of marriage till you are clear of the world You will have  l  to pay directly You will have the interest of  l  more to pay And you men of title on your marriages whather you like ostentation or not must be ostentatious Your equipages your houses your furnitureA certain increase of expenceBy no means my Lord L think of marriage till you are quite clear of the world unless you could meet with some rich widow or heiress who could do the business at once  Lord L could only at first urge his passion He durst not his daughter's affection and the happiness of both which were at stake Sir Thomas opposed discretion to that plea Poor  passion  Lucy would be ashamed to see the sun if  discretion  were always to be attended to in treaties of this kind  Afterwards he told Sir Thomas that he would accept the Lady upon his own terms He besought his consent to their nuptials He would wait his own time and pleasure He would be content if he gave not Miss Caroline a single shilling  Sir Thomas was fretfulAnd so Loverlike you would involve the girl you profess to love in difficulties I will ask her if she wants for anything with me that a modest girl can wish for But to be serious it is a  plaguy  thing for a man to be obliged by the officious  Love  as it is called of a pretender to his daughters to open his affairs and expose his circumstances to strangers I wish my Lord that you had let my girls alone I wish you had not found them out in their countryretirement I should have carried them to town as I told you in a few months Women so brought up so qualified and handsome girls are such rarities in this age and men worth having are so affrighted at the luxury and expensiveness of the modern women that I doubted not but the characters of my girls would have made their fortunes with very little of my help They have  family  my Lord to value themselves upon tho' but spinsters And let me tell you since I shall be thought a more unnatural man than I am if I do not obey the present demand upon me to open my circumstances I owe my son a great deal more than  l  I don't understand you Sir Thomas  Why thus my Lord I explain myself My father left me what is called rich I lessen'd the ready money which he had got together for a purchase he lived not to complete a great deal That I looked upon as a deodand So was not answerable for it And as I was not married my son had no right in it When I was married and he was given me  Forgive me Sir Thomas Your son a  right  And had not your other children  No my Lord They were girlsAnd as to them had I increased my fortune by penuriousness instead of living  like a man  I was determined as to their fortunes  But as I was saying when Lady Grandison died I think tho' every father does not nor should I were he not the best of sons and did he  expect  it the produce of her jointure which is very considerable should have been my son's As to what I annually allowed him  that  it was my duty to allow him as my son and  for my own credit had his mother not brought me a shillingThen my Lord I have been obliged to take up money upon my Irish estate which being a familyestate my son ought to have had come clear to him You see my Lord how I expose myself  You have a generous way of thinking Sir Thomas as to your son But a man of your spirit would despise me if I did not  say  that  I have not so generous a way of thinking for my daughtersI will save your Lordship the trouble of speaking out because it is more agreeable from myself than it would be for any other man to do it But to this I answer that the late Earl of L your Lordship's father had one son and three daughtersI have one son and two He was an EarlI am but a simple BaronetIf  l  apiece is enough for an Earl's daughters half the sum ought to do for a Baronet's  Your fortune Sir ThomasAnd in England where estates  And where living my Lord will be five times more expensive to you than it need to be if you can content yourself to live where your estate liesAs for me I have lived nobly But had I been as rich as my father left me  l  should have done with a daughter I assure you You my Lord have  your  notions I have  mine  Money and a girl you expect from me I ask nothing of you As matters stand if my girls will  keep  and I hope they will I intend to make as good a bargain for them and with them as I can Not near  l  apiece must they expect from me I will not rob my son more than I  have  doneSee here is a Letter from him It is in answer to one I had written on the refusal of a wretch to lend me upon my Irish estate a sum that I wanted to answer a debt of honour which I had contracted at Newmarket unless my son tho' it is an estate in see would join in the security Does not such a son as this deserve everything  I obtained a sight of this letter and here is a copy  Honoured Sir  I COULD almost say I am sorry that so superior a spirit as yours should vouchsafe to comply with Mr O's disagreeable and unnecessary demand But at least let me ask Why Sir did you condescend to write to me on the occasion as if for my consent Why did you not send me the deeds ready to sign Let me beg of you everdear and everhonour'd Sir that you will not suffer any difficulties that I can join to remove to oppress your heart with doubts for one moment Are you not my  father  And did you not give me a mother whose memory is my glory That I  am  under God is owing to you That I am  what I am  to your indulgence Leave me not anything You have given me an education and I derive from you a spirit that by God's blessing on my duty to you will enable me to make my own fortune And in that case the foundation of it will be yours and you will be entitled for that foundation to my warmest gratitude Permit me Sir to add that be my income ever so small I am resolved to live within it And let me beseech you to remit me but one half of your present bounty My reputation is established and I will engage not to discredit my father All I have ever aimed at is to be in condition rather to lay than to receive an obligation  That  your goodness has always enabled me to do And I am rich thro' your munificence richer in your favour  Have you any thought Sir of commanding me to attend you at Paris or at the Hague according to the hopes you gave me in your lastI will not if you do me this honour  press  for a return with you to my native country But I long to throw myself at your feet and whereever the opportunity of that happiness shall be given me to assure you personally of the inviolable duty of  Your  CHARLES GRANDISON  Must not such a letter as this Lucy have stung to the heart a man of Sir Thomas Grandison's pride If not what  was  his prideSir Thomas had as good an education as his son Yet could not live within the compass of an income of upwards of  l  a year His son called himself rich with  l  or  l  a year and tho' abroad in foreign countries desired but half that allowance that he might contribute by the other half to lessen the difficulties in which his father had involved himself by his extravagance  His father Lady L says  was  affected with it He wept He blessed his son and resolved for his sake to be more cautious in his wagerings than he had hitherto been Policy therefore would have justified the young gentleman's chearful compliance had he  not  been guided by superior motives O my dear the Christian Religion is a blessed religion How does honest policy as well as true greatness of mind recommend that noble doctrine of returning good for evil  LETTER XV Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  MY Lord  repeated  his request that he might have Sir Thomas's consent to his nuptials upon his own terms and promised never to expect a single shilling in dowry but to leave the whole of that to time and to his own convenience and pleasure  We know said Sir Thomas what all this means You talk my Lord like a young man You ought not to think You once said it yourself of involving a young woman you love as well as yourself in difficulties I know the world and what is best to be done if you will think no more of my daughter I hope she has discretion  First Love  is generally  first Folly  It is seldom  fit  to be encouraged Your quality my Lord to say nothing of your merit will procure you a rich  wife from the city And the city now is as genteel as polite as the court was formerly The wives and daughters of citizens poor fellows are apes of us gentry and succeed pretty well as to outward appearance in the mimickry You will by this means shake off all your father's sins I speak in the language of young fellows who expect a father to live solely for them and not for himself Some sober young men of quality and fortune affrighted at the gaiety and extravagance of the modern women will find out my girls Who I hope will have patience If they have not let them pursue their inclinations Let them take their  fill of Love  as Solomon says and if they run their heads into an hedge let them stick there by the horns with all heart  See my dear what a man a rakish father isO my good Lady Grandison how might your choice have punished your children  I pray to God Sir Thomas said my Lord bowing but angry I pray to God to continue me in a different way of thinking from yours if this  be  yours Give me leave to say you are too young a gentleman to be a father of grownup children But I must love Miss Grandison and still if possible poor young Lady more than ever for what has passed in this conversation And saying this he withdrew  Sir Thomas was very angry at this spirited speech He sent for his daughter and forbad her to receive my Lord's addresses He order'd her never to think of him And directing Miss Charlotte to be call'd in repeated his commands before her and threatened to turn them both out of his house if they presumed to encourage any address but with his knowledge And don't think said he of going on to  engage your affections  as a sensual forwardness is called and then hope to take advantage of  my  weakness to countenance  your own  I know the world I know your sexYour sister I see Charlotte is a whining fool See how  she whimpers Begone from my presence Caroline And remember Charlotte for I suppose this impertinent Lord's address to your sister will go near to set you agog that I expect whether absent or present to know of any application that may be made to you before your liking has taken root in Love as it is called and while my advice may have the weight that the permission or dissent of a father ought to have  They both wept courtesied and withdrew  At dinner Miss Caroline begged to be excused attending her gay and arbitrary father being excessively grieved and unfit as she desired her sister to say to be seen But he commanded her attendance  Miss Charlotte Grandison told me what this wicked man Shall I call Sir Charles Grandison's father so said on the occasion  "Womens tears are but as the Poet says the sweat of eyes Caroline's eyes will not misbecome them The more she is ashamed of herself the less reason will she give me to be ashamed of herLet me see how the fool looks now she is conscious of her folly Her bashful behaviour will be an halfconfession and this is the first step to amendment Tell her that a woman's grief for not having been able to carry her point has always been a pleasure to me I will not be robbed of my pleasure She owes it me for the pain she has given me"  Lord L and she had parted He had on his knees implored her hand He would not he said either ask or expect a shilling of her father His estate would and should work itself clear without injury to his sisters or postponing their marriage Her prudence and generosity he built upon They would enable him to be just to every one and to preserve his own credit He would not he generously said for the beloved daughter's sake utter one reflecting word upon her father after he had laid naked facts before her Those however would too well justify him if he did And  he again urged for her hand and for a private marriage Can I bear to think with patience my dearest Miss Grandison added he that you and your sister according to Sir Thomas's scheme shall be carried to town with minds nobler than the minds of any women in it as adventurers or  female  fortunehunters to take the chance of attracting the eyes and hearts of men whether worthy or unworthy purely to save your father's pocket No madam Believe me I love you not for my own sake merely tho' heaven knows you are dearer to me than my life but for yours as well And my whole future conduct shall convince you that I do My Love madam has  friendship  for its basis and your worthy brother once in an argument convinced me that Love might be  selfish  that  friendship  could not and that in a pure flame they could not be disunited and when they were that Love was a cover only to a baseness of heart which taught the pretender to it to seek to gratify his own passion at the expence of the happiness or duty of the object pretended to be beloved  See my LucyDid we Girls ever think of this nice but just distinction before And is not  friendship  a nobler band than  Love  But  is  not Lord L a good man Don't you love him LucyWhy have I not met with these notions before in the men I have known  But Miss Caroline was not less generous than my Lord L No scheme of my father's shall make me forget said she the merits of Lord L Your Lordship's affairs will be made easier by time I will not embarrass you Think not yourself under any obligation to me Whenever any opportunity offers to make you easy all at once for a mind so generous ought not to be laid under difficulties embrace it Only let me look upon you as my  friend  till envy to an happier woman or other unworthiness in Caroline Grandison make me forfeit your good opinion  Generous creature said my Lord Never will I think of any other wife while you are single Yet will I not fetter her who would leave me freeMay I madam hope if you will not bless me with your hand now that my letters will be receivedYour father in forbidding my address to you has forbidden me his house He is and ought to be master in itMay I hope madam a correspondence  I am unhappy said she that having such a brother as sister never had I cannot consult him The dear Charlotte is too partial to me and too apt to think of what may be her own case But my Lord I depend upon your honour which you have never given me reason to doubt that you will not put me upon doing a wrong thing either with regard to my duty to my father or to my own character Try me not with a view to see the power you have over me That would be ungenerous I own you have some Indeed a great deal  LETTER XVI Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Tuesday Night  YOU may guess what were my Lord's assurances on this generous confidence in him They agreed upon a private correspondence by lettersAh Lady L was this  quite  right tho' it came out happily in the event Does not concealment always imply somewhat wrong Ought you not to have done  your  duty whether your father did  his  or not Were you not called upon as I may say to a  tryal  of  yours  And is not virtue to be proved by tryal Remember you not who says  "For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently But if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with God"    But you Lady L had lost your excellent mother very early  The worthy young Lady would not however be prevailed upon to consent to a private marriage and my Lord took leave of her Their parting was extremely tender and the amiable Caroline in the softness of her heart overcome by my Lord's protestations of everlasting Love to her in preference to all the women on earth voluntarily assured him that she never would receive any other proposal while he was living and single  Sir Thomas shew'd himself so much displeased with Lord L for the freedom of his last speech that my Lord chose not to desire another audience of him and yet being unwilling to widen the difference he took polite leave of the angry Baronet in a letter which was put into his hands just before he had commanded Miss Caroline to attend him at dinner which she had begged to be excused doing  Don't you pity the young Lady Lucy in this situation Lord L having but a little before taken leave of her and set out for London  Miss Charlotte told her sister that were it she she should hardly have suffer'd Lord L to go away by  himself  Were it but to avoid an interview with a father who seem'd to have been too much used to womens tears to be moved by them and who had such a satyrical vein and such odd notions of Love  I was very earnest to know what passed at this dinnertime  Miss Grandison said It is best for  me  to answer Miss Byron's curiosity I believe as I was a standerby and only my father and sister were the players  Players  repeated Lady LIt was a cruel scene And I believe Miss Byron it will make you not wonder that I liked Lord L much the better for being rather a man of understanding than a man of wit  Miss Grandison began as follows  I went up with my father's  peremptory  as I may call it to my sister  O my dear mamma said Caroline when she found she must go down on what a new occasion do I want your sweet mediation But Charlotte I can neither  walk  nor  stand    You must then lean upon me my dear and  creep  Love will creep they say where it cannot go  Wicked girl interrupted Lady L I remember that was what she said  I said it to make you smile if I could and take courage But you know I was in tears for you notwithstanding  You thought of what might befal yourself Charlotte  So I did We never I believe  properly  feel for others what does not touch ourselves  A compassionate heart said I is a blessing though a painful one And yet there would be no supporting life if we felt quite as poignantly for others as we do for ourselves How happy was it for my Charlotte that she could smile when the father's apprehended lecture was intended for the use of both  I thank you for this Harriet You will not be long my creditorBut I will proceed  Caroline took my advice She leaned upon me and creep creep creep down she crept A fresh stream of tears fell from her eyes when she came to the diningroom door Her tremblings were increased And down she dropt upon a windowseat in the passage I can go no further said she  Instantly a voice that we knew must be observed alarmed our earsWhere are you Caroline Charlotte Girls where are you The housekeeper was in hearing and ran to us Ladies Ladies Your papa callsAnd we in spite of the weakness of the one and the unwillingness of the other recovered our feet and after half a dozen creeping motions more  found ourselves within the door and in our father's sight my sister leaning upon my arm  What devil's in the wind now What tragedymovements are hereWhat measured stepsIn some cases all women are natural actresses But come Caroline the play is over and you mistake your cue  Good SirHer hands held upI wept for her and for my own remoter case if you will Miss Byron  The prologue is yours Caroline Charlotte I doubt not is ready with her epilogue But come come it is time to close this farceTake your places girls and don't be foolsA pretty caution thought I said Miss Charlotte when you make us both such  However the servants entering with dinner we hemm'd handkerchief'd twinkled took up our knives and forks laid them down and took them up again when our father's eye was upon us piddled sipped but were more busy with our elbows than with our teeth As for poor sister Caroline love stuck in her throat She tried to swallow as one in a quinsey a wry face and a strain'd neck denoting her difficulty to get down but a lark's morselAnd what made her more aukward I am sure it did me was a pair of the sharpest eyes that ever were seen in a man's head and the man a father the poor things having no mother no aunt to support their spirits cast first on the one then on the other and nowandthen an overclouded brow adding to our aukwardness Yet still more apprehensive of dinnertime being over and the withdrawing of the servants  The servants loved their young Ladies They attended with very serious faces and seemed glad when they were dismissed  Then it was that Caroline arose from her seat made her courtesy aukwardly enough with the air of a boardingschool Miss her hands before her  My father let her make her honours and go to the door I rising to attend her but then called her back I dare say on purpose to enjoy her aukwardness and to punish her  Who bid you go Whither are you going Caroline Come back CharlotteBut it will be always thus A father's company is despised when a girl gets a Lover into her head Fine encouragement for a father to countenance a passion that shall give himself but a second or third place who once had a first in his childrens affections But I shall have reason to think myself fortunate perhaps if my children do not look upon me as their enemyCome back when I bid you  We crept back more aukwardly than we went from table  Sit downWe cross'd our hands and stood like a couple of fools  Sit down when I bid you You are confoundedly humble I want to talk with you  Down sat the two simpletons their faces and necks all awry and on the edge of their chairs  Miss Grandison then gave the following dialogue She humourously by her voice an humble one for her sister a less meek one for herself an imperious one for Sir Thomas marked the speakers I will prefix their names  Sir Thomas  What sort of leave has Lord L taken of you Caroline He has sent  me  a Letter Has he sent  you  one I hope he did not think a personal leave due to the daughter and not to the father  Charlotte  He thought you were angry with him Sir said I Poor Caroline's answer was not ready  Sir Tho  And supposed that your sister was  not  Very well What leave did he take of you girl woman What do you call yourself  Charlotte  Sir my Lord L I dare say intended no disrespect to  I might as well have been silent Harriet  Sir Tho  I like not your preface girl interrupted heTell me not what  you  dare say I spoke to your sisterCome sit upright None of your averted faces and wry necks A little more innocence in your hearts and you'll have less shame in your countenances I see what a league there is between you A promising prospect before me with you  both  But tell me Caroline do you love Lord L Have you given him hope that you will be his when you can get the cross father to change his mind or what is still better out of your way for ever All fathers are plaguy illnatur'd when they do not think of their girls fellows as their foolish girls think of them Answer me Caroline  Caroline  weeping at his severe speech Whan can I say Sir and not displease you  Sir Tho  WhatWhy that you are all obedience to your father Cannot you say  that  Sure you can say  that  Car  I hope Sir  ir Tho  And I  hope  too But it becomes you to be  certain  Can't you answer for your own heart  Car  I believe you think Sir that Lord L is not an unworthy man  Sir Tho  A man is not more worthy for making my daughter forget herself and behave like a fool to her father  Car  I may behave like a fool Sir but not undutifully You frighten me Sir I am unable to hold up my head before you when you are angry with me  Sir Tho  Tell me that you have broken with Lord L as I have commanded you Tell me that you will never see him more if you can avoid it Tell me that you will not write to him  Car  Pardon me Sir for saying that Lord L's behaviour to me has been ever uniformly respectful He reveres my papa too How can I treat him with disrespect  Sir Tho  So I shall have it all out presentlyGo on girlAnd do you Charlotte attend to the lesson set you by your elder sister  Char  Indeed Sir I can answer for the goodness of my sister's heart and for her duty to you  Sir Tho  Well said Now Caroline do you speak up for Charlotte's Heart One good turn deserves another But say what you will for each other I will be my own judge of both your hearts and facts shall be the test Do you know Caroline whether Charlotte has any Lover that is to keep you in countenance with yours  Car  I dare say Sir that my sister Charlotte will not disoblige you  Sir Tho  I hope Caroline you can say as much for Charlotte's sister  Car  I hope I can Sir  Sir Tho  Then you know my will  Car  I presume Sir it is your pleasure that I should always remain single  Sir Tho  HeydayBut why pray does your ladyship suppose soSpeak out  Car  Because I think forgive me to say it that my Lord L's character and his quality are such that a more creditable proposal cannot be expectedPray Sir forgive me And she held up her hands prayfashion thus  Well said Caroline thought IPull up a courage my dearWhat a duce  Sir Tho  His qualityGewgawWhat is a Scotish peerageAnd does your silly heart beat after a coronetYou want to be a Countess do youBut let me tell you that if you have a  true  value for Lord L you will not incumbred as he is with sisters fortunes wish him to marry you  Car  As to title Sir that is of very little account with me without the good characterAs to prudence  my Lord L cannot see anything in me to forfeit his prudence for  Well answered Caroline thought I In such a laudable choice all should not be left upon the poor  Lovyer  Sir Tho  So the difficulty lies not with  you  I find  You  have no objection to Lord L if he has none to you You are an humbled and mortified girl then The woman must be indeed in Love who once thinking well of herself can give a preference against herself to her Lover  What business had Sir Thomas to say this my Lucy  Sir Tho  Let me know Caroline what hopes you have given to Lord LOr rather perhaps what hopes he has given  you  Why are you silent Answer me girl  Car  I hope Sir I shall not disgrace my father in thinking well of Lord L  Sir Tho  Nor will he disgrace himself proud as are the Scotish beggars of their ancestry in thinking well of a daughter of mine  Car  Lord L tho' not a beggar Sir would think it an honour Sir  Sir Tho  Well said Go on Go on Why stops the girlAnd so he  ought  But if Lord L is not a beggar for my daughter let not my daughter be a beggar for Lord L But Lord L would think it an honour you sayTo be whatYour husband I suppose Answer my question How stand matters between you and Lord L  Car  I cannot such is my unhappiness say anything that will please my father  Sir Tho  How the girl evades my questionDon't let me repeat it  Car  It is not disgraceful I hope to own that I had rather be  There she stopt and halfhid her face in her bosom  And I thought said Miss Grandison that she never look'd prettier in her life  Sir Tho  Rather be Lord L's wife than my daughterWell Charlotte tell me when are  you  to begin to estrange me from your affections When are  you  to begin to think your father stands in the way of your happiness When do  you  cast your purveying eyes upon a mere stranger and prefer him to your fatherI have done my part I suppose I have nothing to do but to allot you the fortunes that your Lovers as they are called will tell you are necessary to their affairs and then to lie me down and die Your fellows then with you will dance over my grave and I shall be no more remembred than if I had never beenexcept by your brother  I could not help speaking here said Miss Grandison O Sir how you wound meDo all fathersForgive me Sir  I saw his brow begin to lour  Sir Tho  I bear not impertinence I bear notThere he stopt in wrathBut why Caroline do you evade my question You know it Answer it  Car  I should be unworthy of the affection of such a man as Lord L is if I disowned my esteem for him Indeed Sir I have an esteem for Lord L above any man I ever saw You Sir did not always disesteem himMy brother  Sir Tho  So Now all is outYou have the forwardnessWhat shall I call itBut I did and I do esteem Lord LBut as whatNot as a soninlaw He came to me as my son's friend I invited him down in that character He at that time knew nothing of you But no sooner came a single man into a single woman's company but you both wanted to make a match of it You were dutiful And he was prudent Prudent for himself I think you talk'd of his prudence a while ago He made his application to you or you to him I know not whichThen  how poor Caroline wept And I said Miss Charlotte could hardly forbear saying  Barbarous  And when he found himself sure of you then was the fool the father to be consulted And for what Only to know what he would do for two people who had left him no option in the case And this is the trick of you all And the poor father is to be passive or else to be accounted a tyrant  Car  Sir I admitted not Lord L's address but conditionally as you should approve of it Lord L desired not my approbation upon other terms  Sir Tho  What nonsense is thisHave you left me any way to help myselfCome Caroline let me try you I intend to carry you up to town A young man of quality has made overtures to me I believe I shall approve of his proposals I am sure you will if you are not prepossessed Tell me are you have you left yourself at liberty to give way to my recommendationWhy don't you answer meYou know that you received Lord L's addresses  but conditionally as I should approve of them  And your spark desired not your approbation upon other terms Come what say you to thisWhat are you confoundedWell you may if you cannot answer me as I wish If you can why don't youYou see I put you but to your own test  Car  Sir it is not for me to argue with my father Surely I have not  intended  to be undutiful Surely I have not disgraced my family by admitting Lord L's conditional  Sir Tho Conditional  FoolHow conditionalIs it not absolute as to the exclusion of me or of my option But I have ever found that the man who condescends to argue with a woman especially on certain points in which  nature  and not  reason  is concerned must follow her through a thousand windings and find himself farthest off when he imagines himself nearest and at last must content himself panting for  breath to sit down where he set out while she gambols about and is ready to lead him a new course  Car  I hope  Sir Tho  None of your hopesI will have certainty May ICome I'll bring you to a point if I can woman as you areMay I receive proposals for you from any other man Answer me Yes or No Don't deal with me as girls do with  common  fathersDon't be disobedient and then depend upon my weakness to forgive you I am no  common  father I know the world I know your Sex I have  found  more fools in it than I have  made  Indeed no man makes or needs to make you fools You have folly deeprooted within you That weed is a native of the soil A very little watering will make it sprout and choak the noble flowers that education has planted I never knew a woman in my life that was wise by the experience of other people But answer me SayCan you receive a new proposal or can you not  Caroline answer'd only by her tears  Sir Tho  Damnably  constant  I supposeSo you give up real virtue give up duty to a  father  for fidelity for constancy for a fictitious virtue to a  Lover  Come hither to me girlWhy don't you come to me when I bid you  LETTER XVII Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  MISS Caroline arose Four creeping steps her handkerchief at her eyes brought her within her father's reach He snatched her hand quicken'd her pace and brought her close to his knees Poor sister Caroline thought I O the  ty  And I had like at the time to have added the syllable  rant  to myselfHe pulled the other hand from her eye The handkerchief dropt He might see that it was wet and  heavy with her tears Fain would she have turn'd her blubber'd eye from him He held both her hands and burst out into a laugh  And what cries the girl for Why Caroline you  shall  have a husband I tell you I will hasten with you to the London market Will you be offer'd at Ranelagh market first the concert or breakfastingOr shall I shew you at the opera or at the play Ha ha hahHold up your head my amorous girl You shall stick some of your mother's jewels in your hair and in your bosom to draw the eyes of fellows You must strike at once while your face is new or you will be mingled with the herd of women who prostitute their faces at every polite place Sweet impatient soulLook at me Caroline Then he laughed again  Car  Indeed Sir if you were not my father  Well said Caroline thought I and trod on her toe  Sir Tho  Heyday But what then  Car  I would say you are very cruel  Sir Tho  And is that all you would say poor soft thing in such circumstances to any  other  man Well but all this time you don't tell me still holding her hands whether any other man will not do as well as your Scotsman  Car  I am not kindly used Indeed Sir you don't use me kindly I hope I am  not  an  amorous  creature as you call me I am  not  in haste to be married I am willing to wait your time your pleasure But as I presume that there can be no objection to Lord L I wish not to be carried to any  London market  Sir Tho  gravely If I am disposed to railly you Caroline if I am willing to pass off in a pleasant manner a forwardness that I did not expect in my daughter and for which in my heart I have despised the daughters of other men tho' I have not told the wenches so I will  not be answered pertly I will not have you forget yourself  Car  courtesying Good Sir permit me to withdraw I will recollect myself and be sorry  Sir Tho  And is it necessary for you to withdraw to recollect your  duty  But you shall answer my questionHow stand you and Lord L Are you resolved to have him and none otherWill you wait for him will he wait for you till death has numbered me with my ancestors  Car  O Sir And she look'd down after her dropt handkerchief She wanted it and would have withdrawn one of her hands to reach it and when she could not the big tears running down her cheeks Yet she look'd pretty down she dropt on her kneesForgive me SirI dread your displeasureBut must say that I am not an  amorous  girl And to convince you that I am not I will never marry any man living if it be not Lord L  I all this time was in agitations for my poor sister I tired three chairs and now look'd at her now from her then at my fingers ends wishing them claws and the man an  husband  instead of a father Indeed Miss Byron I could not but make Caroline's treatment my own and in fancy not so very remote as you imagin'd Lady L Once I said to myself If some Lord L tenders himself to me and I like him I will not stand all this The first moonlight night if he urge me heartily and I am sure the parson is ready I will be under another protection despicably as I have always thought of runaway daughtersShould I have done right Miss Byron  The example Miss Grandison replied ISuch a mamma as you were blessed with The world that would have sat in judgment upon the flight of the daughter would not have known the cruel treatment of the father I believe my dear you are glad you  had not the trial And you see how Lady L is rewarded for her patient duty  That's my good Harriet said Lady L I love you for your answer But Sister you leave me in too much distress You must release me from my knees and send me up to my chamber as fast as you can  A little patience Lady LBut what say my minutesMiss Byron seems all attention This is a new subject to her She never had anybody to controul her  I think I could have borne anything from a father or mother said I had it pleased God to continue to me so dear a blessing  Fine talking Harriet said Miss Grandison But let me say that a witty father is not a desirable characterBy the way ours was as cruel Shall I say it Lady L You are upon your knees you know to two very worthy sisters of his own One of them ran away from him to a relation in Yorkshire where she lives still and as worthy an old maid she is as any in the county The other died before she could get her fortune paid or she would have been married to a man she loved and who loved her But she left every shilling of her fortune to her maiden sister and nothing to my father  It is well my brother is not in hearing said Lady L He would not have borne the hundredth part of what we have said But sufferers will complain Remember however Charlotte that I am still upon my knees  See my Lucy Rakish men make not either good husbands or good fathers nor yet good brothersBut no wonder The narrowhearted creatures centre all their delight in themselvesFinely do women choose who taken in by their specious airs vows protestations become the abject properties of such wretches Yet a reformed rake they say makes the best husbandAgainst general experience this is said  But by whom By the vulgar and the inconsiderate only surely  Miss Grandison proceeded  Sir Tho  You will never marry any other man livingAnd this is declared in order to convince me that you are not amorousQuibbling nonsenseHad you  not  been amorous you had not put yourself into a situation that should give you courage to say this to me Bold fool Begone  She arose  Yet you shall not go holding both her hands And dare you thus declare yourselfWhat option I again ask you is left meAnd yet Lord L and you as you pretended just now were determined only on a  conditional  courtship as I should or should not  approve  of it Consound your Sex This ever was and ever will be the case The blind god sets you out where you mean the  best  on a pacing beast you amble prance parade till your giddy heads turn round and then you gallop over hedge and ditch leap fences and duty decency and discretion are trodden under foot  Poor Miss Caroline said I Lucy to them bothI expected this cruel retort  I foresaw it replied Lady L And this kept me off so long from declaring my preference of Lord L to all the men in the world as in justice to his merit my heart several times bid me do without scruple  Begone from my presence said Sir Thomas proceeded Miss GrandisonYet he still held her handsThat little witch I have been watching her eyes and every working muscle of her saucy face meaning poor me said Miss Grandison She takes part with you in all your distressesYou are forely distressed are you notAm I not a tyrant with you bothYou want to be gone both of you Then shall I be the subject of your free discourses All the resentment that now you endeavour to confine will then burst  out I shall be intitled to no more of your duty than is consistent with your narrow interest Lord L will be consulted in preference to me and have the whole confidence of my daughters against me I am now from this hour to be looked upon as your enemy and not your father But I will renounce you both and permit your brother the joy of my life and the hope of my better days to come over And he shall renounce you as I do or I will renounce him And in that case I shall be a father without a child yet three living by the best of women How would she  I broke out here said Miss Grandison with an emotion that I could not suppress O my dear mamma How much do we miss youWere you to have become angel when we were  infants  should we have missed you as we do  now  O my dear mamma This this is the time that girls most want a mother  I was about to sly for it I trembled at the sternness of my father's looks on this apostrophe to my mother He arose Caroline don't stir said he I have something more to say to you Comehither Charlotte and held out both his handsYou have burst out at last I saw your assurance swelling to your throat  I threw myself at his feet and besought him to forgive me  But taking both my hands in one of his as I held them up foldedCurse me if I do said he I was willing you should be present in hopes to make you take warning by your sister's folly and inconsistency Lord L has been a thief in my house He has stolen my elder daughter's affections from me Yet has drawn her in as pretending that he desired not her favour but as I approved of his addresses I do  not  approve of them I hope I may be allowed to be my own judge in this case She however declares she will have nobody else And have I brought up my  children till the years that they should be of use and comfort to me and continued a widower myself for their sakes So my father was pleased to say said Miss Grandison and all for a man I approve notAnd do you Charlotte call your blessed mother from her peaceful tomb to relieve you and your sister against a tyrantfatherWhat comfort have I in prospect before me from such daughtersBut leave me Leave my house Seek your fortunes where you will Take your cloaths Take all that belongs to you But nothing that was your mother's I will give you each a draught on my banker for  l  When that is gone according to what I shall hear of your behaviour you shall or shall not have more  Dear Sir said Caroline flinging herself on her knees by me forgive my sisterDear good Sir whatever becomes of  me  forgive your Charlotte  Sir Tho  You are fearless of  your  destiny Caroline You will throw yourself into the arms of Lord L I doubt notI will send for your brother But you shall both leave this house I will shut it up the moment you are gone It shall never again be open'd while I live When my ashes are mingled with those of your mother then may you keep open house in it and trample under foot the ashes of both  I sobbed out Dear Sir forgive me I meant not to reflect upon my father when I wish'd for my mother I wish'd for her for  your  sake Sir as well as for  ours  She would have mediatedShe would have soften'd  Sir Tho  My hard heartI know what you mean Charlotte  And flung from us a few paces walking about in wrath leaving us kneeling at his vacant chair  He then ringing the bell the door in his hand ordered in the housekeeper She enter'd A very good woman she was She trembled for her kneeling Ladies  Sir Th  Beckford do you assist these girls in getting up every thing that belongs to them Give me an inventory of what they take Their father's authority is grievous to them They want to shake it off They find themselves womengrown They want husbands  Indeed indeed Beckford we don't said Caroline interrupted by my father  Do you give me the lye boldface  Pray your honourGood your honourintreated honest Beckford never were modester young Ladies They are noted all over the county for their modesty and goodness  Woman woman argue not with me Modesty never forgets duty Caroline loves not her father Lord L has stolen away her affections from me Charlotte is of her party And so are you I find But take my commands in silenceA week longer they stay not in this house  Beckford throwing herself on her knees repeatedGood your honour  We both arose and threw ourselves at his feet  Forgive us I beseech you forgive usFor my mamma's sake forgive ussaid Caroline  For my mamma's sake for my brother's sake dear Sir forgive your daughters cried I in as rueful an accent  And we each of us took hold of his open'd coat both in tears and Beckford keeping us company  Unmoved he went onI intend you a  pleasure  girls I know you want to be freed from my authority You are womengrown The man who has daughters knows not discomfort with them till busy fellows bid them look out of their father's house for that happiness which they hardly ever find but in it  We are yours my papa said IWe are nobody's elseDo not do not expose your children to the  censures of the world Hitherto our reputations are unsullied  Dear Sir cried Caroline throw us not upon the world the wide world Dear Sir continue us in your protection We want not to be in any other  You shall try the experiment girlsI am not fit to be your counsellor Lord L has distanced me with the one The other calls upon her departed mother to appear to shield her from the cruelty of an unnatural father And Lord L has the insolence to tell me to my face that I am too young a father to take upon me the management of womengrown daughters And so I find it Blubber not Beckford assist your young Ladies for their departure A week is the longest time they have to stay in this house I want to shut it up Never more to enter its gates  We continued our pleadings  O Sir said Caroline turn not your children out of doors We are  daughters  We never more wanted a father's protection than now  What have we done Sir cried I to deserve being turned out of your doorsFor every offensive word we beg your pardon You shall always have dutiful children of us Permit me to write to my brother  So so You mend the matter You want to interest your brother in your favourYou want to appeal to him do you and to make a son sit in judgment upon his fatherPrate not girls Intreat notGet ready to be gone I will shut up this house  Whereever you are Sir intreated I there let us beRenounce not your children your penitent children  He proceeded I suppose Lord L will as soon find out your person Caroline as he has your inclinations so contrary to my liking As to you Charlotte you may go down to your old aunt  Prue  in  Yorkshire He calls their aunt Eleanor so from the word  Prude  Yet we have seen Lucy it was owing to him that this Lady did not marry She will be able to instruct you that patience is a virtue and that you ought not to be in haste to take a first offer for fear you should not have a second  Poor sister Caroline He look'd disdainfully at her  You are my father Sir said she All is welcome from you But you shall have no cause to reproach me I will not be in haste And here on my knees I promise that I will never be Lord L's without your consent I only beg of you Sir not to propose to me any other man  My father partly relented partly Harriet I take you at your word And I insist that you shall not correspond with him nor see himYou answer not to that But you know my will And once more answer or not I require your obedience Beckford you may go Rise Caroline  And am  I  forgiven Sir said IDear Sir forgive your CharlotteYet Miss Byron what was my crime  Make the best use of the example before you Charlotte Not to imitate Caroline in engaging your affections unknown to meRemember  that  She has  her  plagues in giving  me  plague It is fit she should Where you cannot in duty follow the example take the warning  Beckford was withdrawn He graciously saluted each girl And thus triumphantly made them express sorrow forDo you know for what Harriet  I wish thought I to myself Lucy that these boisterous spirits either fathers or husbands were not generally most observed  But was Miss Grandison's spirit so easily subdued thought I  You smile Harriet What do you smile at  Will you forgive me if I tell you  I don't know  I depend on your goodnature I smiled to think Lady L how finely Miss Grandison has got up since that time  Miss Gr  O the sly girlRemember you not that I was before your debtor  A good hit I protest said Lady L Yet Charlotte was always a pert girl out of her father's presence But I will add a word or two to my sister's narrative  My father kept us with him till he read Lord L's Letter which he open'd not till then and plainly as I saw to find some new fault with him and me on the occasion But I came off better than I apprehended I should at the time for I had not seen it Here is a copy of it  Lady L allow'd me Lucy to take it up with me when we parted for the night  PERMIT me Sir by pen and ink rather than in person as I think it will be most acceptable to you to thank you as I most cordially do for the kind and generous treatment I have received at your hands during a whole month's residence at Grandisonhall whither I came with intent to stay but three days  I am afraid I suffer'd myself to be surprised into an undue warmth of expression when I last went from your presence I ask your pardon if so You have a right in your own child God forbid that I should ever attempt to invade it But what a happy man should I be if my Love for Miss Grandison and that right could be made to coincide I may have appeared to have acted wrong in your apprehension in applying myself first to Miss Grandison I beg Sir your pardon for that also  But perhaps I have a still greater fault to atone for I need not indeed acquaint you with it but had rather  intitle myself by my ingenuousness to your forgivness than wish to conceal any thing from you in any article of this high importance whether you grant it me or not I own then that when I last departed from your angry presence I directly went to Miss Grandison and on my knees implored her hand I presumed that an alliance with me was not a disgraceful one and assured her that my estate should work itself clear without any expectation from you as it will I hope in a few years by good management to which I was sure she would contribute But she refused me and resolved to await the good pleasure of her father yet giving me I must honestly add condescending hopes of her favour could your consent be obtained  Thus is the important affair circumstanced  I never will marry any other woman while there is the least shadow of hope that she can be mine The conversation of the best of young men your son for two months in Italy and one before  that  in some of the German courts has made me ambitious of following such an example in every duty of life And if I might obtain by your favour so dear a wife and so worthy a brother as well as so amiable a sister as Miss Charlotte the happiest man in the world would then be  Sir Your obliged and faithful servant L  Yet my father said Lady L called it an artful Letter and observed that Lord L was very sure of me or he had not offer'd to make a proposal to me that deserved not to be excused You were aiming at prudence girl in your refusal I see that said my father You had no reason to doubt but Lord L would hereafter like you the better for declining marriage in that clandestine manner because the refusal would  give him an opportunity to make things more convenient to himself One half of a woman's virtue is pride continued he I hope not truly said Lady L the other half policy If they were sure the man would not think the worse of them for it they would not wait a second question Had you had an independent fortune Caroline what wou'd you have doneBut go you are a weak and yet a cunning girl Cunning is the wisdom of women Womens weakness is man's strength I am sorry that  my  daughters are not compounded of less brittle materials I wonder that any man who knows the sex marries  Thus spoke the  rakish  the  keeping  father Lucy endeavouring to justify his private vices by general reflexions on the sex And thus are wickedness and libertinism called a knowledge of the world a knowledge of human nature Swift for often painting a dunghil and for his abominable Yahoe story was complimented with this knowledge But I hope that the character of human nature the character of creatures made in the image of the deity is not to be taken from the overflowings of such dirty imaginations  What company my dear must those men be supposed to have generally kept How are we authorised to wish only that good is often produced out of evil as is instanced in two such daughters and such a son that a man of this cast had never had the honour to call a Lady Grandison by his name And yet Sir Thomas's vices called forth if they did not establish her virtues What shall we say  Whatever is is in its causes just  But purblind man  Sees but a part o'th' chain the nearest link  His eyes not carrying to that equal beam  That poises all above  DRYD  I thought my Lucy that the conversation I have attempted to give would not tho' long appear tedious to you being upon a  new  subject the behaviour of a freeliver of a father to his grownup daughters when they came to have expectations upon him which he was not disposed to answer and the rather as it might serve to strengthen us who have had in our family none but good men tho' we have neighbours of a different character who have wanted to be acquainted with us in our resolution to reject the suits of libertine men by a stronger motive even than  for our own sakes  And I therefore was glad of the opportunity of procuring it for you and for our Nancy now her recover'd health will allow her to look abroad more than she had of late been used to do I am sure my grandmamma and my aunt Selby will be pleased with it because it will be a good supplement to the lessons they have constantly inculcated upon us against that narrowhearted race of men who live only for the gratification of their own lawless appetites and consider all the rest of the world as made for themselves the worst and most noxious reptiles in it  LETTER XVIII Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  THUS far had the Ladies proceeded in their interesting story when the Letters of my grandmamma and aunt were brought me by a man and horse from London By my answer you will see how much I was affected by the contents The Ladies saw my uneasiness and were curious to know the cause I told them from whence the Letters came and what the subject was and that my aunt was to give for me next Saturday an answer to Lady D in person  I then retired to write When I had dispatched the messenger the Ladies wished to know the resolution I had come to I told them I had confirmed my negative  Miss Grandison with archness held up her hands and eyes I was vexed she did Then Charlotte said I spitefully  you  would not have declined accepting this proposal  She looked earnestly at me and shook her head Ah Harriet said she you are an unaccountable girl You will tell the truth but not the whole truth  I blushed as I felt and believe looked silly  Ah Harriet repeated she looking as if she would look me through  Dear Miss Grandison said I  There is some Northamptonshire gentleman of whom we have not yet heard  I was a little easier then But  can  this Lady mean anything particular She cannot be so ungenerous surely as to play upon a poor girl if she thought her  entangled  All I am afraid of is that my temper will be utterly ruined I am not so happy in myself as I used to be Don't you think Lucy that taking one thing with another I am in a situation that is very teazingBut let me find a better subject  THE Ladies at my request pursued their FAMILYHISTORY  Lord L and Miss Caroline went on hoping for a change in Sir Thomas's mind He would no doubt they said have been overcome by the young Lady's duty and my Lord L's generosity had he not made it inconvenient to himself to part with money  He went to town and carried his daughters with him and it is thought would not have been sorry had the Lovers married without his consent for he prohibited anew on their coming to town my Lord's visits so that they were obliged to their sister as she  pleasantly had told Lady L for contriving to forward their interviews  Mean time my Lord's affairs growing urgent by reason of his two sister's marrying he gave way to the offers of a common friend of his and Lord W's to engage that nobleman who approved of the match to talk to Sir Thomas on the subject  Lord W and the Baronet met My Lord was earnest in the cause of the lovers Sir Thomas was not pleased with his interfering in his family affairs And indeed a more improper man could hardly have been applied to on the occasion For Lord W who is immensely rich was always despised by Sir Thomas for his avarice and he as much disliked Sir Thomas for what he called his profusion  High words passed between them They parted in passion and Sir Thomas resenting Lord L's appeal to Lord W the sisters were in a worse situation than before for now besides having incurred the indignation of their father their uncle who was always afraid that Sir Thomas's extravagance would reduce the children to the necessity of hoping for his assistance made a pretence of their father's ill treatment of him to disclaim all acts of kindness and relation to them  What concern'd the sisters still more was my Lord's declared antipathy to their brother and that for no other reason but because his father who he was sure he said could neither love nor hate in a right place doated on him  In this sad situation were these Lovers when overtures were made to Sir Thomas for his younger daughter But tho' Miss Charlotte gave him no pretence to accuse  her  of beginning a Loveaffair unknown to him yet those overtures never came to her knowledge from him tho' they did from others And would you have wondered Harriet said she with  such treatment before my eyes as Caroline met with if I had been provoked to take some rash step  No provocation reply'd I from a father can justify a rash step in a child I am glad and so I dare say are you that your prudence was your safeguard when you were deprived of that which so good a child might have expected from a father's indulgence especially when a mother was not in being  Miss Grandison coloured and bit her lip Why did she colour  At last Sir Thomas took a resolution to look into and regulate his affairs preparative to the leave he intended to give to his beloved son to come over From  his  duty discretion and good management he was sure he said he should be the happiest of men But he was at a loss what to do with Mrs Oldham and her two children He doubted not but his son had heard of his guilty commerce with her Yet he cared not that the young gentleman should find her living in a kind of wifelike state in one of the familyseats And yet she had made too great a sacrifice to him to be unhandsomely used and he thought he ought to provide for his children by her  While he was meditating this change of measures that he might stand well with a son whose character for virtue and prudence made his father half afraid of him a proposal of marriage was made to him for his son by one of the first men in the kingdom whose daughter accompanying her brother and his wife in a tour to France and Italy saw and fell in Love with the young Gentleman at Florence And her brother gave way to his sister's regard for him for the sake of the character he bore among the people of prime consideration in Italy  Sir Thomas had several meetings on this subject both with the brother and the Earl his father and was so fond of bringing it to bear that he had thoughts of reserving to himself an annuity and  making over the whole of his estate to his son in favour of this match And once he said He should by this means do as Victor Amadeus of Savoy did rid himself of many incumbrances and being not a  king  was sure of his son's duty to him  The Ladies found a Letter of their brother's among Sir Thomas's loose papers which shewed that this offer had been actually made him This is a copy of it  Dear and everhonoured Sir  I AM astonished at the contents of your last favour If the proposal made in it arose from the natural greatness of your mind and an indulgence which I have so often experienced what shall I say to it I cannot bear it If it proceed from proposals made to you God forbid that I should give your name to a woman how illustrious soever in her descent and how high soever the circumstances of her family whose friends could propose such conditions to my father  I receive with inexpressible joy so near an hope of the long wishedfor leave to throw myself at your feet in my native country When I have this happiness granted me I will unbosom my whole heart to my father The credit of your name and the knowledge every one has of your goodness to me will be my recommendation whenever you shall wish me to enlarge the family connexions  Till I have this honour I beseech you Sir to discontinue the treaty already begun  You are pleased to ask my opinion of the Lady and whether I have any objection to her person I remember I thought her a very agreeable woman  You mention Sir the high sense the Lady as well as Lord and Lady N have of the civilities they received from me My long residence abroad gave me the power of doing little offices for those of my country who visited France and Italy Those services  are too gratefully remember'd by my Lord and the Ladies  I am extremely concern'd that you have reason to be displeased with any part of the conduct of my sisters Can the daughters of such a mother as you had the happiness to give them forget themselves Their want of consideration shall receive no countenance from me I shall let them know that my Love my esteem if it be of consequence with them is not founded on relation but merit And that where duty to a parent is wanting all other good qualities are to be suspected  You ask my opinion of my Lord L and whether he has sought to engage me to favour his address to your Caroline He wrote to me on that subject I inclose his Letter and a copy of my answer As to my opinion of him I must say that I have not met with any British man abroad of whose discretion sobriety and goodnature I think more highly than I do of Lord L's Justice requires of me this testimony But as to the affair between him and my sister I shall be extremely sorry if Lord L's  first  impropriety of behaviour were to you and if my sister has suffer'd her heart to be engaged against her duty  You have the goodness to say that my return will be a strengthening of your hands May my own be weaken'd May I ever want the power to do good to myself or to those I love when I forget or depart from the duty owing to the most indulgent of fathers by  His  CHARLES GRANDISON  WHAT an excellent young man is thisBut observe Lucy he says he will on his return to England unbosom his whole heart to his father and till then he desires him to discontinue the begun treaty with Lord NAh my dearWhat has any  new  acquaintance to expect were she to be intangled in a  hopeless  passion  But let us considerHad Sir Charles been actually married would his being so have enabled a woman's  reason  to triumph over her passionIf so passion is surely conquerable And did I know anybody that wou'd allow it to be so in the  one  case and not in the  other  I would bid her take shame to herself and with deep humiliation mourn her ungovernable folly  The above Letter came not to the hands of the young Ladies till after their father's death which happen'd within a month of his receiving it and before he had actually given permission for the young gentleman's return You may suppose they were excessively affected with the bad impressions their father had sought to make in their brother's heart of their conduct and when he died were the more apprehensive of their force  He had suspended the treaty of marriage for his son till the young gentleman should arrive He had perplexed himself about his private affairs which by long neglect became very intricate and of consequence must be very irksome for such a man to look into He was resolved therefore to leave it to each steward having persuaded himself against appearances to have a good opinion of both to examine the accounts of the other not only as this would give the least trouble to himself but as they had several items to charge which he had no mind should be explained to his son Nor were those gentlemen less solicitous to obtain discharges from him for being apprised of his reason for looking into his affairs they were afraid of the inspection of so good a manager as their young master was known to be  Mr Filmer the steward for the Irish estate came over on this occasion with his accounts The two stewards acted in concert and on the report of each Sir Thomas examined totals only and order'd releases to be drawn for his signing  What a degrader even of  high  spirits is vice What meanness was there in Sir Thomas's pride To be afraid of the eye of a son of whose duty he was always boasting  But who shall answer for the resormation of an habitual libertine when a temptation offers Observe what followed  Mr Filmer knowing Sir Thomas's frailty had brought over with him and with a view to ensnare the unhappy man a fine young creature not more than sixteen on pretence of visiting her aunt who lived in Pallmall and who was a relation of his wife She was innocent of actual crime But her parents had no virtue and had not made it a part of the young woman's education but had on the contrar  brought her up with a notion that her beauty would make her fortune and she knew it was all the fortune they had to give her  Mr Filmer in his attendances on Sir Thomas was always praising the beauty of Miss Obrian her genteel descent as well as figure her innocence Innocence the Attractive equally to the attempts of Rakes and Devils But the Baronet intent upon pursuing his better schemes for some time only gave the artful man the hearing At last however for curiositysake he was prevailed upon to make the aunt a visit The niece was not absent She more than answered all that Filmer had said in her praise as to the beauty of her person Sir Thomas repeated his visits The girl was well tutored behaved with prudence with reserve rather and in short made such an impression on his heart that he declared to Filmer that he could not live without her  Advantage was endeavoured to be taken of his insatuation He offered high terms But for some time the aunt insisted upon his marrying her niece  Sir Thomas had been too long a  leader  in the free world to be so  takenin  as it is called But at last a  proposal was made him from no part of which the aunt declared she would recede tho' the poor girl who it was pretended loved him above all the men she had ever seen were to break her heart for him A fine piece of flattery Lucy to a man who numbered near three times her years and who was still fond of making conquests  The terms were That he should settle upon the young woman  l  a year for her life and on her father and mother if they could be brought to consent to the infamous bargain  l  a year for their joint and separate lives That Miss Obrien should live at one of Sir Thomas's seats in England be allowed genteel equipages his livery and even for her creditsake in the eye of her own relations who were of figure to be connived at in taking his name The aunt left it to his generosity to reward her for the part she had taken and was to take to bring all this about with the parents and girl  Sir Thomas thought these demands much too high He stood out for some time but artifice being used on all sides to draw him on  Love  as it is called prostituted word obliged him to comply  His whole concern was now how to provide for this new expence without  robbing  as he called it his son daughters were but daughters and no part of the question with him and to find excuses for continuing the young gentleman abroad  Mrs Oldham had for some time past been uneasy herself and made him so by her compunction on their guilty commerce and now lately on Sir Thomas's communicating his intention to recal his son had hinted her wishes to be allowed to quit the house in Essex and to retire both from that and him for fear of making the young gentleman as much her enemy as the two sisters avowedly were  Mrs Oldham's proposal now that he was acquainted with Miss Obrian was better relished by Sir Thomas than when it was first made And before he actually signed and sealed with the aunt for her niece he thought it was best to sound that unhappy woman whether she in earnest desired to retire and if so what were her expectations from him Resolving in order to provide for both expences to cut down timber that he said groaned for the ax but which hitherto he had let stand as a resource for his son and to enable him to clear incumbrances that he had himself laid upon a part of his estate  Accordingly he set out for his seat in Essex  THERE while he was planning future schemes of living and reckoning upon his savings in several articles in order the better to support an expence so guiltily to be incurred and had actually begun to treat with Mrs Oldham who agreed at the first word to retire not knowing but his motive poor man as well as hers was reformation There was he attacked by a violent fever which in three days deprived him of the use of that reason which he had so much abused  Mr Bever his English steward posted down on the first news he had of his being taken ill hoping to get him to sign the readydrawn up releases But the eagerness he shewed to have this done giving cause of suspicion to Mrs Oldham she would not let him see his master tho' he arrived on the second day of Sir Thomas's illness which was before the fever had seized his brain  Mr Filmer had been to meet and conduct to London Mrs Obrian the mother of the girl who came over to see the sale of the poor victim's honour completed Could you have thought Lucy there was such a mother in the world and it was not till the fifth day of the unhappy man's illness that he got to him with his releases also ready drawn up as well  as the articles between him and the Obrians in hopes to find him well enough to sign both He was in a visible consternation when he found his master so ill He would have staid in the house to watch the event but Mrs Oldham not permitting him to do so he put up at the next village in hopes of a favourable turn of the distemper  On the sixth day the physicians giving no hopes of Sir Thomas's recovery Mrs Oldham sent to acquaint the two young Ladies with his danger and they instantly set out to attend their father  They could not be supposed to love Mrs Oldham and taking Mr Grandison's advice who accompanied them they let the unhappy gentlewoman know that there was no farther occasion for her attendance on their father She had prudently before that she might give the less offence to the two Ladies removed her son by her former husband and her two children by Sir Thomas but insisted on continuing about him and in the house as well from motives of tenderness as for her own security lest she should be charged with embezlements for she expected not mercy from the family if Sir Thomas died  Poor woman what a tenure was that by which she held  Miss Caroline consented and brought her sister to consent that she should stay absolutely against Mr Grandison's advice who libertine as he was himself was very zealous to punish a poor Magdalen who  tho'  faulty was not so faulty as himself Wicked people I believe my dear are the severest punishers of those wicked people who administer not to their own particular gratifications Can mercy be expected from such Mercy is a  virtue  It was shocking to the last degree to the worthy daughters to hear their raving father call upon nobody so often as upon Miss Obrian tho' they then knew nothing of the girl nor of the treaty on foot for her  nor could Mrs Oldham inform them who or what she was Sometimes when the unhappy man was quietest he would call upon his son in words generally of kindness and Love Once in particular crying outO save me save me my Grandison by thy presence I shall be consumed by the fire that is already lighted up in my boiling blood  On the ninth day no hope being left and the physicians declaring him to be a dying man they dispatched a Letter by a messenger to hasten over their brother who having left his ward Miss Emily Jervois at Florence in the protection of the worthy Dr Bartlett was come to Paris as he had written in expectation of receiving there his father's permission to return to England  On the eleventh day of his illness Sir Thomas came a little to himself He knew his daughters He wept over them He wish'd he had been kinder to them He was sensible of his danger Several times he lifted up his feeble hands and dying eyes repeating God is just I am I have been very wicked Repentance Repentance how hard a task said he once to the minister who attended him and whose prayers he desiredAnd Mrs Oldham once coming in his sightO Mrs Oldham said he what is this world now What wou'd I giveBut repent repentPut your good resolutions in practice lest I have more souls than my own to answer for  Soon after this his delirium return'd and he expired about eleven at night in dreadful agonies Unhappy manJoin a tear with mine my Lucy on the awful exit of Sir Thomas Grandison tho' we knew him not  Poor man in the pursuitPoor manHe lived not to see his beloved son  The two daughters and Mr Grandison and Mrs Oldham for her own security put their respective seals on every place at that house where papers or  anything of value were supposed to be reposited And Mr Grandison assuming that part of the management dismissed Mrs Oldham from the house and would not permit her to take with her more than one suit of cloaths besides those she had on She wept bitterly and complained of harsh treatment But was not pitied and was referred by Mr Grandison to his absent cousin for still more rigorous justice  She appealed to the ladies but they reproach'd her with having lived a life of shame against better knowledge and said That now she must take the consequence Her punishment was but beginning Their brother would do her strict justice they doubted not But a man of his virtue they were sure would abhor her She had misled their father they said It was not in his temper to be cruel to his children She had lived upon their fortunes and now they had nothing but their brother's favour to depend upon  Daughters so dutiful my Lucy did right to excuse their father all they could But Mrs Oldham suffer'd for all  I AM so much interested in this important history▪ that I have not the heart to break into it to tell you how very agreeably I pass my time with these ladies and Lord L in those parts of the day when we are all assembled Miss Emily has a fine mind gentle delicate innocently childish beyond her stature and womanly appearance but not her years The two Ladies are very good to her Lord L is an excellent man  This is Friday morning And no Sir Charles  Canterbury  is surely a charming place Was you ever at  Canterbury  Lucy  Tomorrow Lady D is to visit my aunt My letter to my aunt will be in time I hope I long to  knowYet why should IBut Lady D is so  good  a woman I hope she will take kindly my denial and look upon it as an absolute one  I have a great deal more of the familyhistory to give you I wish I could write as fast as we can talk But Lucy concerning the Lady with whose father Sir Thomas was in treaty for his son Don't you want to know something more about herBut ah my dear be this as it may there  is  a Lady in whose favour both sisters interest themselves I have found that out Nor will it be long I suppose before I shall be informed who she is and whether or not Sir Charles encourages the proposal  Adieu my Lucy You will soon have another Letter from  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XIX Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  YOU see my dear how many important matters depended on the conduct and determination of the young Baronet  Lord I was at this time in Scotland where he had seen married two of his three sisters and was busying himself in putting his affairs in such a way as should enable him to depend the less either on the justice or generosity of Sir Thomas Grandison whose beloved daughter he was impatient to call his  Miss Charlotte was absolutely dependent upon her brother's generosity and both sisters had reason to be the more uneasy as it was now in the worldlywise way of thinking become his  interest  to keep up the distance which their unhappy father had been sollicitous to create between them from a policy low and entirely unworthy of him  The unhappy Mrs Oldham had already received a severe instance of the change of her fortune and  had no reason to doubt but that the sisters who had always from the time she was set over them as their governess look'd upon her with an evil eye and afterwards had but too just a pretence for their aversion would incense against her a brother whose fortune had been lessen'd by his father's profusion The few relations she had living were people of honour who renounced all correspondence with her from the time she had thrown herself so absolutely into the power of Sir Thomas Grandison And she had three sons to take care of  Bever and Filmer the English and Irish stewards were attending Sir Charles's arrival with great impatience in hopes he would sign those accounts of theirs to which they had no reason to question but his father would have set his hand had he not been taken so suddenly ill and remained delirious almost to the end of his life  Miss Obrian her mother and aunt I shall mention in another place  Lord W had a great dislike to his nephew for no other reason as I have said than because he was his father's favourite Yet were not his nieces likely to find their uncle more their friend for that He was indeed almost entirely under the management of a woman who had not either the birth the education the sense or moderation of Mrs Oldham to put in the contrary scale against her lost virtue but abounded it seems in a low selfish cunning by which she never failed to carry every point she set her heart upon For as is usual they say with these keeping men Lord W would yield up to avoid her teazing what he would not have done to a wife of fortune and family who might have been a credit to his own But the  real slave  imagined himself master of his  liberty  and sat down satisfied with the sound of word  The suspended treaty of marriage with Lord N's sister was also to be taken into consideration either  to be proceeded with or broken off as should be concluded by both parties  This was the situation of affairs in the family when Sir Charles arrived  He return'd not an answer to his sister's notification of his father's danger but immediately set out for Calais and the same day arrived at the house of his late father in St James's Square His sisters concluded that he would be in town nearly as soon as a Letter could come They therefore every hour for two days together expected him  Judge my dear from the foregoing circumstances sisterly Love out of the question which yet it could not be how awful must be to them after eight or nine years absence the first appearance of a brother on whom the whole of their fortunes depended and to whom they had been accused by a father now so lately departed of want of duty their brother's duty unquestionable  In the  same  moment he alighted from his postchaise the door was open'd he enter'd and his two sisters met him in the hall  The graceful youth of seventeen with fine curling auburn locks waving upon his shoulders delicate in complexion intelligence sparkling in his fine free eyes and good humour sweetening his lively features they remembred And forgetting the womanly beauties into which their own features were ripen'd in the same space of time they seemed not to expect that manly stature and air and that equal vivacity and intrepidity which every one who sees this brother admires in his noble aspect An aspect then appearing more solemn than usual an unburied and beloved father in his thoughts  O my brother said Caroline with open arms But shrinking from his embrace  May  I say my brotherand was just fainting He clasped her in his arms to support her  Charlotte surprised at her sister's emotion and affected with his presence ran back into the room they had both quitted and threw herself upon a settee  Her brother followed her into the room his arm round Miss Caroline's waist soothing her and with eyes of expectation my Charlotte said he his inviting hand held out and hastening towards the settee She then found her feet and throwing her arms about his neck he folded both sisters to his bosom Receive my dearest sisters receive your brother your friend assure yourselves of my unabated Love  That assurance they said was balm to their hearts and when each was seated he sitting over against them look'd first on one then on the other and taking each by the hand Charming women said he How I admire my sisters You  must  have minds answerable to your persons What pleasure what pride shall I take in my sisters  My dear Charlotte said Miss Caroline taking her sister's other hand has not our brother now we see him near all the brother in his aspect His goodness only looks stronger and more perfect What was I afraid of  My  heart also sunk said Charlotte I know not why But we fearedIndeed Sir we both fearedO my brotherTears trickling down the cheeks of eachwe meant not to be  undutiful    Love your brother my sisters as he will endeavour to deserve your Love My mother's daughters could not be undutiful Mistake only Unhappy misapprehension We have all somethingShades as well as lights there must beA kind a dutiful veil  He pressed the hand of each with his lips arose went to the window and drew out his handkerchief  What must he have in his thoughts No doubt but his father's unhappy turn and recent departure No wonder that such a son could not without pious  emotion bear the reflexions that must croud into his mind at that instant  Then turning towards them permit me my dear sisters said he to retire for a few moments He turn'd his face from them My father said he demands this tribute I will not ask  your  excuse my sisters  They joined in the payment of it and waited on him to his apartment with silent respect No ceremony I hope my Caroline my Charlotte We were true sisters and brother a few years ago See your Charles as you saw him then Let not absence which has increased my Love lessen yours  Each sister took a hand and would have kissed it He clasped his arms about them both and saluted them  He cast his eye on his father's and mother's pictures with some emotion then on them and again saluted each  They withdrew He waited on them to the stairhead Sweet obligingness Amiable sisters In a quarter of an hour I seek your presence  Tears of joy trickled down their cheeks In half an hour he joined them in another dress and resaluted his sisters with an air of tenderness that banished fear and left room for nothing but sisterly love  Mr Grandison came in soon after That gentleman who as I believe I once before mentioned had affected in support of his own free way of life to talk how he would laugh at his cousin Charles when he came to England on his  pious  turn as he called it and even to boast that he would enter him into the towndiversions and make a  man  of him was struck with the dignity of his person and yet charmed with the freedom of his behaviour Good God said he to the Ladies afterwards what a fine young man is your brotherWhat a selfdenier was your father  The Ladies retiring Mr Grandison enter'd upon the circumstances of Sir Thomas's illness and death which he told the sisters he touch'd  tenderly  As tenderly I suppose as a man of his unfeeling heart could touch such a subject He inveighed against Mrs Oldham and with some exultation over her told his cousin what they had done as to her and exclaim'd against her for the state she had lived in and the difficulty she made to resign Sir Thomas to his daughters care in his illness and particularly for presuming to insist upon putting her seal with theirs to the cabinets and closets where they supposed were any valuables  Sir Charles heard all this without saying one word either of approbation or otherwise  Are you not pleased with what we have done as to this vile woman Sir Charles  I have no doubt cousin replied Sir Charles that every thing was design'd for the best  And then Mr Grandison as he told the sisters ridiculed the unhappy woman on her grief and mortified behaviour when she was obliged to quit the house where he said she had reigned so long Lady Paramount  Sir Charles ask'd If they had search'd for or found a will  Mr Grandison said They had look'd in every probable place but found none  What I think to do cousin said Sir Charles is to interr the venerable remains I must always speak in this dialect Sir with those of my mother This I know was his desire I will have an elegant but not sumptuous monument erected to the memory of both with a modest inscription that shall rather be matter of instruction to the living than a panegyric on the departed The funeral shall be decent but not ostentatious The difference in the expence shall be privately applied to relieve or assist distressed  housekeepers or some of my fathers poor tenants who have large families and have not been wanting in their honest endeavours to maintain them My sisters I hope will not think themselves neglected if I spare them the pain of conferring with them on a subject that must afflict them  These sentiments were new to Mr Grandison He told the sisters what Sir Charles had said I did not contradict him said he But as Sir Thomas had so magnificent a mind and always lived up to it I should have thought he ought to have been honoured with a magnificent funeral But I cannot but own however that what your brother said had something great and noble in it  The two Ladies on their brother's hinting his intentions to them acquiesced with all he proposed and all was performed according to directions which he himself wrote down He allowed of his sisters compliance with the fashion But he in person saw performed with equal piety and decorum the last offices  Sir Charles is noted for his great dexterity in business Were I to express myself in the language of Miss Grandison I should say that a sunbeam is not more penetrating He goes to the bottom of an affair at once and wants but to hear both sides of a question to determine and when he determines his execution can only be staid by perverse accidents that lie out of the reach of human foresight And when he finds  that  to be the case yet the thing right to be done he changes his methods of proceeding as a man would do who finding himself unable to pursue his journey by one road because of a sudden inundation takes another which tho'a little about carries him home in safety  As soon as the solemnity was over Sir Charles leaving every thing at Grandisorhall as he found it and the seals unbroken came to town and in the  presence of his sisters broke the seals that had been affixed to the cabinets and escrutoires in the house there  The Ladies told him that their bills were ready for his inspection and that they had a balance in their hands His answer was I hope my dear sisters we shall have but one interest It is for you to make the demands upon me and for me to answer them as I shall be able  He made memorandums of the contents of many papers with surprising expedition and then locked them up He found a bank note of  l  in the private drawer of one of the bureaus in the apartment that was his father's Be pleased my sisters said he presenting it to Miss Caroline to add that to the money in your hands to answer family calls  He then went with his sisters to the house in Essex When there he told them it was necessary for Mrs Oldham who had lodgings at a neighbouring farmhouse to be present at the breaking of the seals as she had hers affixed and accordingly sent for her  They desired to be excused seeing her  It will be a concern to me said he to see her But what  ought  to be done  must  be done  The poor woman came with fear and trembling  You will not Lucy be displeased with an account of what passed on the occasion I was very attentive to it as given by Miss Grandison whose memory was aided by the recollection of her sister And as I am used to aim at giving affecting scenes in the very words of the persons as near as I can to make them appear lively and natural you will expect that I should attempt to do so in this case  Sir Charles not expecting Mrs Oldham would be there so soon was in his stud with his groom and coachman looking upon his horses For there were most of the hunters and racers some of the finest beasts in the kingdom  By mistake of Miss Caroline's maid the poor woman was shewn into the room where the two Ladies were She was in great confusion courtesied wept and stood as well as she could stand but leaned against the tapestryhung wall  How came this said Miss Caroline to her maid  She  was not to be shewn in to us  I beg pardon courtesying and was for withdrawing but stopt on Charlotte's speech to herMy  brother  sent for you madamNot  we  I assure youHe says it is necessary as you thought fit to put your seal with ours to the lockedup places that you should be present at the breaking them Yet he will see you with as much pain as you give us Prepare yourself to see him You seem mighty unfitNo wonder  You have heard Lucy that Charlotte attributes a great deal of alteration for the better in her temper and even in her heart to the example of her brother  Indeed I am unfit  very  unfit said the poor woman Let me Ladies bespeak your generosity A little of your pity A little of your countenance I am indeed an unhappy woman  And so you deserve to be  I am sure we are the sufferers said Caroline  Lord L as she owned was then in her head as well as heart  If I may withdraw without seeing Sir Charles I should take it for a favour I find I cannot bear to see him I insist not upon being present at the breaking the seals I throw myself upon your mercy Ladies and upon his  Cruel girls shall I call them Lucy I think I will  Cruel  girls They ask'd her not to sit down tho' they saw the terror she was in And that she had the modesty to forbear sitting in their presence  What an humbling thing is the consciousness of having lived faultily when calamity seizes upon the  heartBut shall not virtue be appeased when the hand of God is acknowledged in the words countenance and behaviour of the offender Yet perhaps it is hard for sufferersLet me considerHave I from my heart forgiven Sir Hargrave Polvexfen I will examine into that another time  And so you have put yourself into mourning madam  Shall I say that Caroline said this and what follows Yet I am glad it was not Charlotte methinks for Caroline thought herself a sufferer by her in an especial mannerHowever I am sorry it was either  Pretty  deep  too Your weeds I suppose are at your lodgings  You have been told Lucy that Mrs Oldham by many was called Lady Grandison▪ and that her birth her education good sense tho' all was not sufficient to support her virtue against necessity and temptation poor woman might have given her a claim to the title  Indeed Ladies I am a  real  mourner▪ But I never myself assumed a character to which it was never in my thought to solicit a right  Then  madam  the world does you injustice  madam  said Charlotte  Here Ladies are the keys of the stores of the confectionary of the winevaults You demanded them not when you dismissed me from this house I thought to send them▪ But by the time I could provide myself with a lodging you were gone and left only two common servants besides the groom and helpers And I thought it was best to keep the keys till I could deliver them to your order or Sir Charles's I have not been a bad manager Ladies consider'd as an housekeeper All I have in the world is under the seals I am at yours and your brother's mercy  The sisters order'd their woman to take the keys  and bring them to the foot of their thrones Dear Ladies forgive me if you should by surprize see this I know that you think and act in a different manner now  Here comes my brother said Caroline  You'll soon know Madam what you have to  to from  him  said Charlotte  The poor woman trembled and turned pale O how her heart must throb I warrant  LETTER XX Miss  BYRON  In continuation  SIR Charles enter'd She was near the door His sisters were at the other end of the room  He bowed to herMrs Oldham I presume said hePray Madam be seated I sent to you that you might see the sealsPray Madam sit down  He took her hand and led her to a chair not far distant from them and sat down in one between them and her  His sisters owned they were startled at his complaisance to her Dear Ladies they forgot at that moment that  mercy  and  justice  are sistergraces and cannot be separated in a virtuous bosom  Pray madam compose your self looking upon her with eyes of anguish and pity mingled as the Ladies said they afterwards recollected with more approbation than at the time What my Lucy must be the reflexions of this humane man respecting his father and her at that moment  He turn'd to his sisters as if to give Mrs Oldham time to recover herself A flood of tears relieved her She tried to suppress her audible sobs and most considerately he would not hear them Her emotions attracting the eyes of the Ladies he took them off by asking them something about a picture that hung on the other side of the room  He then drew his chair nearer to her and again taking her trembling handI am not a stranger to your melancholy story Mrs OldhamBe not discomposed  He stopt to give her a few moments time to recover herselfResuming See in me a friend ready to thank you for all your past good offices and to forget all mistaken ones  She could not bear this She threw herself at his feet He raised her to her chair  Poor Mr Oldham said he was unhappily careless Yet I have been told he loved you and that you merited his LoveYour misfortunes threw you into the knowledge of our family You have been a faithful manager of the affairs of this houseBy written evidences I can justify you evidences that no one here will I am sure dispute  It was plain that his father had written in her praise as an oeconomist the only light in which this pious son was then willing to consider her  Indeed I haveAnd I would still have been  No more of that madam Mr Grandison who is a goodnatured man but a little hasty has told me that he treated you with unkindness He owns you were patient under it Patience never yet was a solitary virtue He thought you wrong for insisting to put your seal But he was mistaken You did right as to the thing and I dare say a woman of your prudence did not wrong in the manner No one can judge of another that cannot be that very other in imagination when he takes the judgmentseat  O my brother O my brothersaid both Ladies at one timehalf in admiration tho' halfconcern'd at a goodness so eclipsing  Bear with me my sisters We have  all  something to be forgiven for  They knew not how far they were concern'd in his opinion in the admonition from what their  father had written of  them  They owned that they were mortified Yet knew not how to be angry with a brother who tho' more than an equal sufferer with them could preserve  his  charity  He then made a motion dinnertime as he said not being near for chocolate and referred to Mrs Oldham to direct it as knowing best where everything was She referred to the deliver'dup keys Caroline called in her servant and gave them to her Sir Charles desired Mrs Oldham to be so good as to direct the maid  The Ladies easily saw that he intended by this to relieve the poor woman by some little employment and to take the opportunity of her absence to endeavour to reconcile them to his intentions as well as manner of behaving to her  The moment she was gone out of the room he thus addressed himself to the Ladies  My dear sisters let me beg of you to think favourably of me on this occasion I would not disoblige you for the world I consider not the case of this poor woman on the foot of her own merits with regard to us Our father's memory is concern'd Was  he  accountable to us was  she  for what each didNeither of them was She is intitled to justice for its own sake To generosity for ours To kindness for my father's Mr Grandison accused her of living in too much state as he called it Can that be said to be  her  fault With regard to  us  was it  anybody  's My father's magnificent spirit is well known He was often at this house Whereever he was he lived in the same taste He praises to me Mrs Oldham's oeconomy in several of his Letters He had a right to do what he would with his own fortune It was not  ours  till now Whatever he  has  left us he might have still lessen'd it That oeconomy is all that concerns us in interest and that is in her favour If any act of kindness to my sisters was wanting from  the parent they will rejoice that they  deserved  what they hoped to meet with from him And where the parent had an option they will be glad that they acquiesced under it He could have given Mrs Oldham a title to a name that would have commanded our respect if not our reverence My sisters have enlarged minds They are daughters of the most charitable the most forgiving of women Mr Grandison it could not be  you  has carried too severe an hand towards her Yet he meant service to us all I was willing before I commended this poor woman to your  mercy  since it was necessary to see her to judge of her behaviour Is she not humbled enough From my soul I pity her She loved my father and I have no doubt but mourns for him in secret yet dares not own dares not plead her love I am willing to consider her only as one who has executed a principal office in this house It becomes us so to behave to her as that the world should think we consider her in that light only As to the  living proofs  unhappy innocents I am concern'd that what are the delight of other parents are the disgrace of this But let  us  not by resentments publish faults that could not be  hers only  Need I say moreIt would pain me to be obliged to it With pain have I said thus muchThe circumstances of the cafe are such that I cannot give it its full force I ask it of you as a favour not as a right I should hate myself were I capable of exerting to the utmost any power that may be devolved upon me that you will be so good as to leave the conduct of this affair to me You will greatly oblige me if you can give me your chearful acquiescence  They answer'd by tears They could not speak  By this time Mrs Oldham returned and in an humble manner offer'd chocolate to each young lady They bent their necks not their bodies with cold civility as they owned each extending her stately hand  as if she knew not whether she should put it out or not  Methinks I see them How could such gracious girls be so ungracious after what Sir Charles had said  Their brother they saw seemed displeased He took the salver from Mrs Oldham Pray madam sit down said he offering her a dish which she declined and held the toasted bread to his sisters who then were ready enough to take each someAnd when they had drank their chocolate Now Mrs Oldham said he I will attend youSisters you will give me your company  They arose to follow him The poor woman courtesied I warrant and stood by while they passed And methinks I see the dear girls bridle and walk as stately and as upright as dutchesses may be supposed to do in a coronationprocession  Miss Grandison acknowledged that she grudged her brother's extraordinary complaisance to Mrs Oldham and said to her sister as arm in arm they went out Politeness is a charming thing Caroline  I don't quite understand it replied the other  They did not intend their brother should hear what they said But he did and turned back to them Mrs Oldham being at a distance and on his speaking low dropping still further behind them Don't you my sisters do too little and I will not do too much She is a gentlewoman She is unhappy from  within  Thank God  you  are not And she is not now nor ever was your servant  They reddened and looked upon each other in some confusion  He pressed each of their hands as in Love Don't let me give you concern said he only permit me to remind you while it is yet in time that you have an opportunity given you to shew yourselves Grandisons  When they came to the chamber in which Sir Thomas died and which was his usual apartment Mrs Oldham turned pale and begged to be excused attending them in it She wept You will find everything there Sir said she to be as it ought I am ready to answer all questions Permit me to wait in the adjoining drawingroom  Sir Charles allow'd her request  Poor woman said he How unhappily circumstanced is she that she dares not in  this  company shew the tenderness which is the glory not only of the female but of the human nature  In one of the cabinets in that chamber they found a beautiful little casket and a paper wafer'd upon the back of it with these words written in Sir Thomas's hand  My wife's jewels  c  The key was tied to one of the silver handles  Had you not my mother's jewels divided between you ask'd he  My father once shew'd us this casket at Grandisonhall answer'd Caroline We thought it was still there  My dear sisters let me ask you Did my father forbear presenting these to you from any declared  misapprehension  of your want of duty to him  No replied Miss Caroline But he told us they should be ours when we married You have heard I dare say that he was not fond of seeing us dressed  It must have been  misapprehension  only had it been so You could not be undutiful to a  father  He would not permit it to be open'd before him But presenting it to them Receive your right my sisters It is heavy I hope there is more than jewels in it I know that my mother used to deposit in it her little hoard I am sure there can be no dispute between such affectionate sisters on the partition of the contents of this casket  While their brother was taking minutes of papers c the ladies retired to open the casket  They found three purses in it in one of which was an India bond of  l  inclosed in a paper thus inscribed by Lady Grandison  From my maiden money  Caroluses were also in this purse in two papers the one inscribed  From my aunt Molly  the other  From my aunt Kitty  In the second purse were Jacobuses in a paper thus inscribed by the same Lady  Presents made at different times by my honoured mamma Lady W  three bank notes and an India bond to the amount of  l  The third purse was thus labelled as Lady L shewed me by a copy she had of it in her memorandum book  "  For my beloved son  In acknowledgement of his duty to his father and me from infancy to this hour Jan Of his love to his sistersOf the generosity of his temper never once having taken advantage of the indulgence shewn him by parents so fond of him that as the only son of an antient family he might have done what he pleased with themOf his love of truth And of his modesty courage benevolence steadiness of mind docility and other great and amiable qualities by which he gives a moral assurance of making A GOOD MANGOD grant it Amen"  The Ladies immediately carried this purse thus labelled to their brother He took it read the label turning his face from his sisters as he readExcellent woman said he when he had read it  Being dead she speaks  May her pious prayer be answer'd looking up Then opening the purse he found five coronationmedals of different princes in it and several others of value a gold snuffbox in  which wrapt in cotton were three diamond rings one fignified to be his grandfather's the two others an uncle's and brother's of Lady Grandison But what was more valuable to him than all the rest the Ladies said was a miniature picture of his mother set in gold an admirable likeness they told me and they would get their brother to let me see it  Neglecting all the rest he eagerly took it out of the shagreen case gazed at it in silence kissed it a tear falling from his eye He then put it to his heart Withdrew for a few moments and return'd with a chearful aspect  The Ladies told him what was in the other two purses They said they made no scruple of accepting the jewels but the bonds the notes and the money they offer'd to him  He ask'd If there were no particular direction upon either They answer'd No  He took them and emptying them upon the table mingled the contents of both together There may be a difference in the value of each Thus mingled you my sisters will equally divide them between you This picture putting his hand on his bosom where it yet was is of infinite more value than all the three purses contained besides  You will excuse these particularities my dear friends But if you do not I can't help it We are all apt I believe to pursue the subjects that most delight us Don't grudge me my pleasure Perhaps I shall pay for it I admire this man more than I can express  Saturday NightAnd  no  Sir Charles Grandison With all my heart  LETTER XXI Miss  BYRON  n Continuation  WHEN Sir Charles and his sisters had look'd over every other place in his father's apartment they followed Mrs Oldham to hers  A very handsome apartment upon my word  How  could  Miss GrandisonShe knew the situation the unhappy woman had been in Mistress of that house  Her brother look'd at her  Mrs Oldham shewed them which of the furniture and pictures some of the latter valuable ones she had brought into the house saved as she said from the wreck of her husband's fortuneBut said she with the consent of creditors I for  my part  did not wrong anybody  In that closet Sir continued she pointing to it is all that I account myself worth in the world Mr Grandison was pleased to put his seal upon the door I besought him to let me take  l  out of it having but very little money about me But he would not His refusal besides the disgrace has put me to some shifts But weeping I throw myself upon your mercy Sir  The sisters frankly owned that they harden'd each other by faultfinding They whisper'd that she expected no mercy from  them  it was plain O what a glory belongs to goodness as well in its influences as in itself Not even these two amiable sisters as Miss Charlotte once acknowleged were so noble in themselves before their brother's arrival as they are now  Assure yourself of justice madam said Sir Charles Mr Grandison is hasty But he would have done you justice I dare say He thought he was acting for a trustYou may have letters you may have things  here in this closet that we have no business withThen breaking the seal I leave it to you to shew us anything proper for us to take account of The rest I wish not to see  My Ladies SirThey will be pleased to  YES Mrs Oldham said Caroline And was putting herself before her brother and so was her sister while Sir Charles was withdrawing from the closet But he took each by her hand interrupting Caroline  No  Mrs Oldham  Do you lay out things as you please We will step into the next apartment  He accordingly led them both out  You are very generous Sir said Miss Grandison  I  would  be so Charlotte Ought not the private drawers of women to be sacred  But such a creature Sirsaid Miss Caroline  Every creature is intitled to justiceCan Ladies forget decorum You see she was surprised by Mr Grandison She has suffer'd disgrace Has been put to shifts  Well Sir if she will do justice  Remember with looks of meaning whose  housekeeper  she was  They owned they were daunted And so dear Ladies you ought to have been but not convinced at that instant It is generous to own this because the acknowledgment makes not for your glory Ladies  Mrs Oldham with tears in her eyes came courtesying to the Ladies and their brother offering to conduct them into her closet They found that she had spread on her table in it and in the two windows and in the chairs letters papers laces fine linen c  These papers Sir said she belong to you I was  bid  to keep them safe Poor woman she knew not how to say  by whom  bid You will see Sir the seals are whole  Perhaps a  will  said he  No Sir I believe not I was told they belonged to the Irish estate Alas and she wiped her eyes I have reason to think there was not time for a will  I suppose Mrs Oldham you urged for a willsaid Miss Charlotte  Indeed Ladies I often did I own it  I don't doubt it said Miss Caroline  And very  prudently  said Sir Charles I myself have always had a will by me I should think it a kind of  presumption  to be a week without one  In this drawer Sir are the money and notes and securities that I have been getting together I do assure you Sir very honestlypulling out a drawer in the cabinet  To what amount Mrs Oldham if I may be  so bold  ask'd Caroline  No matter sister Caroline to what amount said Sir Charles You hear Mrs Oldham say they are honestly got together I dare say that my father's bounty enabled even his meanest  servants  to save money I would not keep one that I thought did not I make no comparisons Mrs Oldham You are a gentlewoman  The two Ladies only whisper'd to each other as they owned  So we think  Were there ever such perverse girls I am afraid my uncle will think himself justified by them on this occasion when he asserts that it is one of the most difficult things in the world to put a woman right when she sets out wrong If it be generally so with us I am sure we ought to be very careful of prepossessionAnd has he not said Lucy that the best women when wrong are most tenacious It may be so But then I hope he will allow that at the time they  think  themselves right  I believe there is near  l  said Mrs Oldham and look'd the Ladies observed as if she was afraid of their censures  Near  l  Mrs Oldham said Miss Charlotte  Lord sister how glad would we have been sometimes of as many shillings between us  And what Caroline what Charlotte young Ladies as you were but growing up into women and in your father's house would you have done with more than current money Now you have a claim to independency I hope that  l  will not be the sum of either of your stores  They courtesied they said but yet thought  l  a great savingDear Ladies how could you forget and what a pain would it have been for your brother to have reminded you that Mrs Oldham had  two  children to say nothing of a third  Trembling as they owned Here said she in this private drawer are some presentsI disclaim them If you believe me Ladies I never wish'd for them I never was seen in them but once I never shall wear themoffering to pull out the drawer  Forbear Mrs Oldham Presents are yours The money in that drawer is yours Never will I either disparage or diminish my father's bounty He had a right to do as he pleased Have not we to do as we please Had he made a will would they not have been yoursIf you Mrs Oldham if you my sisters can tell me of anything he but intended or inclined to do by any one of his people that intention will I execute with as much exactness as if he had made a will and it was part of it Shall we do nothing but  legal  justiceThe law was not made for a man of conscience  Lord bless me my Lucy what shall I do about this man  HERE would you believe it I laid down my pen ponder'd and wept for  joy  I think it  was  joy that there is such a young man in the world for what else could it beAnd now with a wa'try eye twinkle twinkle do I resume it  His sisters owned they were confounded but that still the time was to come when they were to approve from their hearts of what he said and did  Mrs Oldham wept at his goodness She wept I make no doubt also as a penitentIf my Ladies said she will be pleased toAnd seemed to be about making an offer to themof the jewels as I suppose  My sisters Mrs Oldham said Sir Charles interrupting her are Grandisons Pray madamholding in her hand which was extended to the drawer  She took out of another drawer  l  and some silver This Sir is money that belongs to you I received it in Sir Thomas's illness I have some other moneys and my accounts wanted but a few hours of being perfected when I was dismissed They shall be completed and laid before you  Let this money Mrs Oldham be a part of those accounts declining then to take it  There are Letters Sir said she I would withhold nothing from you I know not if among some things that I wish not  anybody  to see there are not concerns that you ought to be made acquainted with relating to persons and things particularly to Mr Bever and Mr Filmer and their accounts I hope they are good menYou must see these Letters I believe  Let me desire you Mrs Oldham to make such extracts from those Letters or any others as you think will concern me and as soon as you can For those gentlemen have written to me to sign their accounts which they hint had my father's approbation  She then told Sir Charles as I have already related how earnest Mr Bever was to get to the speech of Sir Thomas and how mortified Mr Filmer was to find him incapable of writing his name which both said was all that was wanted  An honest man said Sir Charles fears not inspection  They shall want no favour from me I hope nothing but justice from them  She then shewed him some other papers and while he was turning them over the Ladies and she withdrew to another apartment in which in two mahogany chests was her wardrobe They owned they were curious to inspect it as she had always made a great figure She was intending to oblige them and had actually open'd one of the chests and tho' reluctantly taken out a gown when Sir Charles enter'd  He seemed displeased and taking his sisters aside Tell me said he can what this poor woman seems to be about proceed from her own motion I beg of you to say you put her upon it I would not have reason to imagine that any woman in such circumstances could make a display of her apparel  Why the motion is partly mine I must needs say answer'd Charlotte  Wholly  I hope and the compliance owing to the poor woman's mortified situation You are young women You may not have consider'd this matter Do you imagine that your curiosity will yield you pleasure Don't you know what to expect from the magnificent and bountiful spirit of him to whose memory you owe duty  They recollected themselves blushed and desired Mrs Oldham to lock up the chest She did and seemed pleased to be excused from the mortifying task  Ah my Lucy one thing I am afraid of and that is that Sir Charles Grandison politely as he behaves to us all thinks us women in general very pitiable creatures I wish I knew that he did and that for two reasons That I might have something to think him blameable for And to have the pride of assuring myself that he would be convinced of that fault were he to be acquainted with my grandmamma and aunt  But do you wonder that the sisters whose minds were thus open'd and enlarged by the example of such a brother blazing upon them all at once as I may say in manly goodness on his return from abroad whither he set out a stripling should on all occasions break out into raptures whenever they mention THEIR brotherWell may Miss Grandison despise her Lovers when she thinks of him and of them at the same time  Sunday  Sir Charles is in town we hear Came thither but last nightNay for that matter his sisters are more vexed at him than I amBut what pretence have I to be disturbed But I say of him as I do of Lady D He is so good that one would be willing to stand well with himThen he is my  Brother  you know  LETTER XXII Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  AFTER Sir Charles had inspected into everything in this house and taken minutes of papers letters writings c and lock'd up the plate and other valuables in one room he order'd his servants to carry into Mrs Oldham's apartment all that belonged to her and gave her the key of that and directed the housekeeper to be assisting to her in the removal of them at her own time and pleasure and to suffer her to come and go at all times with freedom and civility as if she had never  left the house  were his words  How the poor woman courtesied and wept I warrant The dear girls I am afraid then envied herand perhaps expressed a grudging spirit for they said This was their brother's address to them at that time  You may look upon the justice I aim at doing to  persons who can claim  only  justice from me as an earnest that I will do  more  than justice to my beloved sisters And you should have been the first to have found the fruits of the love I bear you had I not been afraid that prudence would have narrowed my intentions The moment I know what I can do I will do it and I request you to hope largely If I have ability I will exceed your hopes  My dear sisters continued he and took one hand of each I am sorry for your  spirits  sake that you are left in my power The best of women was always afraid it would be so But the moment I can I will give you an absolute independence on your brother that your actions and conduct may be all your own  Surely Sir said Caroline and they both wept we must think it the highest felicity that we  are  in the power of such a brother As to our  spirits  Sir  She would have said more but could not and Charlotte took it up where her sister left off Best of brothers said sheOur  spirits  shall as much as possible I can answer for both be guided hereafter by yours Forgive what you have seen amiss in usBut we  desire  to depend upon our good behaviour We cannot we will not be independent of you  We will talk of these matters replied he when we can do  more  than talk I will ask you Caroline after your inclinations and you Charlotte after  yours  in the same hour that I know what I can do for you both in the way of promoting them Enter mean time upon your measures Reckon upon my best assistance Banish suspense One of my first pleasures will be to see you both happily married  They did not  say  when they related this to me that they threw themselves at his feet as to their better father as well as brother But I fancy they  did  He afterwards at parting with Mrs Oldham said  I would be glad to know madam how you dispose of yourself Every unhappy person has a right to the good offices of those who are less embarrass'd When you are settled pray let me know the manner And if you acquaint me with the state of your affairs and what you propose to do for and with those who are intitled to your first care your confidence in me will not be misplaced  And pray and pray ask'd I of the Ladies what said Mrs Oldham How did she behave upon this  Our Harriet is strangely taken with Mrs Oldham's story said Miss GrandisonWhy she wept plentifully you may be sure She clasped her hands and kneeled to pray to God to bless him and all thatShe could not do otherwise  See LucyBut am I my grandmamma am I my aunt to blame Is it inconsistent with the strictest virtue to be charmed with such a storyMay not virtue itself pity the lapsedO yes it may I am sure you and Sir Charles Grandison will say it may A while ago I thought my self a poor creature compared to these two Ladies But now I  believe  I am as good as they in some thingsBut  they  had not such a grandmamma and aunt as I am bless'd with  They  lost their excellent mother while they were young and their brother is but lately come over And his superior excellence like sunshine breaking out on a sudden finds out and brings to sight those spots and freckles that were hardly before discoverable  Sir Charles desired Mrs Oldham would give in writing what she proposed to do for herself and for those  who were under her care  She did at her first opportunity It was That she purposed going to London for the sake of the young people's education Of turning into money what jewels cloaths and plate she should think above her then situation in life  Of living retired in a little genteel house And she gave in an estimate of her worth To what amount the Ladies know not but this they know that their brother allows her an annuity for the sake of her sons by his father And they doubt not but he will be still kinder to them when they are old enough to be put into the world  This the Ladies think an encouragement to a guilty life I will not dare to pronounce upon it because I may be thought partial to the generous man But should be glad of my uncle's opinion This however may be said That Sir Charles Grandison has no vices of his own to cover by the extensiveness of his charity and beneficence and if it be not goodness in him to do thus it is greatness and this if it be not praiseworthy is the first instance that I have known goodness and greatness of soul separable  The brother and sisters went down after this to Grandisonhall and Sir Charles had reason to be pleased with the good order in which he found everything there  LETTER XXIII Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  THE next thing the Ladies mentioned was Sir Charles's management with the two stewards  I will not aim at being very particular in this part of the familyhistory  When Sir Charles found that his father had left the inspection of each steward's account to the other he enter'd into the examination of the whole himself and tho' he allowed them several disputable and unproved charges he brought them to acknowledge a much greater ballance in his favour than they had made themselves debtors for This was the use he made of detecting them to his sistersYou see  sisters that my father was not so profuse as some people thought him He had partners in his estate and I have reason to think that he often paid interest for his own money  On his settling with Filmer the treaty with Miss Obrien came out Mr Filmer had by surprize brought that beautiful girl into Sir Charles's presence and he owned to his sisters that she was a very lovely creature  But when the mother and aunt found that he only admired her as a man would a fine picture they insisted that Sir Thomas had promised to marry Miss Obrien privately and produced two of his Letters to her that seemed to give ground for such an expectation Sir Charles was grieved for the sake of his father's memory at this transaction and much more on finding that the unhappy man went down to his seat in Essex his head and heart full of this scheme when he was struck with his last fatal illness  A meeting was proposed by Filmer between Sir Charles the mother the aunt and himself at the aunt's house in Pallmall Sir Charles was very desirous to conceal his father's frailty from the world He met them But before he enter'd into discourse made it his request to be allowed half an hour's conversation with Miss Obrien by herself at the same time praising as it deserved her beauty  They were in hopes that she would be able to make an impression on the heart of so young and so lively a man and complied Under pretence of preparing her for so unexpected a visit her aunt gave her cue But instead of her captivating him he brought her to such confessions as sufficiently let him into the baseness of their views  He returned to company the young woman in his hand He represented to the mother the wickedness of the part she had come over to act in such strong terms that she fell into a fit The aunt was terrified  The young creature wept and vowed that she would be honest  Sir Charles told them That if they would give him up his father's two Letters and make a solemn promise never to open their lips on the affair and would procure for her an honest husband he would give her  l  on the day of marriage and if the made a good wise would be further kind to her  Filmer was very desirous to clear himself of having any hand in the blacker part of this plot Sir Charles did not seem solicitous to detect and expose him But left the whole upon his conscience And having made before several objections to his account which could not be so well obviated in England he went over to Ireland with Filmer and there very speedily settled every thing to his own satisfaction and dismissing him more genteelly than he deserved took upon himself the management of that estate directing several obvious improvements to be made which are likely to turn to great account  On his return he heard that Miss Obrien was ill of the smallpox He was not for her own sake sorry for it She suffer'd in her face but still was pretty and genteel And she is now the honest and happy wife of a tradesman near Goldensquare who is very fond of her Sir Charles gave with her the promised sum and another  l  for weddingcloaths  One part of her happiness and her husband's is that her aunt supposing she had disgraced herself by this match never comes near her And her mother is return'd to Ireland to her husband greatly dissatisfied with her daughter on the same account  While these matters were agitating Sir Charles forgot not to enquire what steps had been taken with regard to the alliance proposed between himself and Lady Frances N  He paid his first visit to the father and brother of that Lady  All that the sisters know of this matter is that the treaty was on this first visit entirely broken off Their brother however speaks of the Lady and of the whole family with great respect The Lady is known to esteem him highly Her father her brother speak of him everywhere with great regard Lord N calls him the finest young gentleman in England And so Lucy I believe he is Sir Charles Grandison Lord N once said knows better by noncompliance how to create friendships than most men do by compliance  Lady L and Miss Grandison who as I have before intimated have another Lady whom they favour once said to him that the Earl and his son Lord N were so constantly speaking in his praise that they could not but think that it would at last be a match between him and Lady Frances His answer was The Lady is infinitely deserving  But it cannot be  I am ready to wish he would say what  can  be that we need notAh LucyI know not what I would say But so it will always be with silly girls that distinguish not between the  would  and the  should  One of which is  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXIV Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  I WILL proceed with the familyhistory  Sir Charles forgot not on his arrival in England to pay an early visit to Lord W his mother's brother who was then at his house near Windsor  I have told you that my Lord had conceived a dislike to him and that for no other reason but because his father loved him Lord W was laid up with the gout when he came But he was instantly admitted to his stately presence The first salutations  on one side were respectful on the other coldly civil My Lord often survey'd his kinsman from head to foot as he sat as if he were loth to like him I suppose yet knew not how to help it He found fault with Sir Thomas Sir Charles told him That it was a very ingrateful thing to him to hear his father spoken slightly of He desired his Lordship to forbear reflections of that sort My father said he is no more I desire not to be made a party in any disputes that may have happen'd between him and your Lordship I come to attend you as a duty which I owe to my mother's memory and I hope this may be done without wounding that of my father  You say well said my Lord but I am afraid kinsman by your air and manner and speech too that you want not your father's proud spirit  I revere my father for his spirit my Lord It might not always be exerted as your Lordship and his other relations might wish But he had a manly one As to myself I will help your Lordship to my character at once I am indeed a very proud man I cannot stoop to slatter and least of all men the great and rich Finding it difficult to restrain this fault it is my whole study to direct it to laudable ends and I hope that I am too proud to do anything unworthy of my father's name or of my mother's virtue  Why Sir and look'd at him again from head to foot your father never in his whole life said so good a thing  Your Lordship knew not my father as he deserved to be known Where there are misunderstandings between two persons tho' relations the character of either is not to be taken from the other But my Lord this is as I said before a visit of duty I have nothing to ask of your Lordship but your good opinion and that no longer than I deserve it  My Lord was displeased  "You have nothing to ask  of me"  repeated he Let me tell you  independent  Sir that I like not your speech You may leave me if you please And when I want to see you again I will send for you  Your servant my Lord and let me say that I will not again attend you till you do But  when  you do the summons of my mother's brother shall be chearfully obeyed when perhaps this unkind treatment of Lord W might be remembred  The very next day my Lord hearing he was still at Windsor viewing the curiosities of the place sent to him He directly went My Lord expressed himself highly pleased with his readiness to come and apologized to him for his behaviour of the day before He called him nephew and swore that he was just such a young man as he had wish'd to see Your mother used to say proceeded he that you could do what you would with her should you even be unreasonable And I beg of you to ask me no favour but what is fit for me to grant for fear I should grudge it after I had granted it and call in question what no man is willing to do my own discretion  He then ask'd him about the methods he intended to take with regard to his way of life Sir Charles answered That he was resolved to dispose of his racers hunters and dogs as soon as he could That he would take a survey of the timber upon his estate and fell that which would be the worse for standing and doubted not but that a part of it in Hampshire would turn to good account But that he would plant an oakling for every oak he cut down for the sake of posterity He was determined he said to let the house in Essex and even to sell the estate there if it were necessary to clear incumbrances and to pay off the mortgage upon the Irish estate which he had a notion was very improvable  What did he propose to do for his sisters who were left he found absolutely in his power  Marry them my Lord as soon as I can I have a good opinion of Lord L My elder sister loves him I will enquire what will make him easy And easy I will make him on his marriage with her if it be in my power I will endeavour to make the younger happy too And when these two points are settled but not before because I will not deceive the family with which I may engage I will think of myself  Bravo bravo said my Lord and his eyes that were brimful some moments before then ran over As I hope to be saved I had a good mind tototoAnd there he stopt  I ask only for your approbation my Lord or correction if wrong My father has been very regardful of my interests He knew my heart or he would perhaps have been more solicitous for his daughters I don't find that my circumstances will be very narrow And if they  are  I will live within compass and even lay up I endeavour to make a virtue of my pride in this respect I cannot live under obligation I will endeavour to be just and then if I can I will be generous That is another species of my pride I told your Lordship that if I could not conquer it I would endeavour to make it innocent at least  Bravo bravo again cried my LordAnd threw his arms about his neck and kissed his cheek tho' he screamed out at the same time having hurt his gouty knee with the effort  And then and thensaid my Lord you will marry yourself And if you marry with discretion good Lord what a  great  man you will beAnd how I shall love youHave you any thoughts of marriage kinsmanLet me be consulted in your matchandandandyou will vastly oblige me Now I believe I shall begin to think the name of Grandison has a very agreeable sound with it What a fine thing it is for a young man to be able to clear  up his mother's prudence so many years after she is gone and lessen his father's follies Your father did not use me well and I must be allowed sometimes to speak my mind of him  That my Lord is the only point on which your Lordship and I  can  differ  Well well we  won't  differOnly one thing my dear kinsman If you sell give me the preference Your father told me that he would mortgage to any man upon God's earth sooner than to me I took that very heinously  There was a misunderstanding between you my Lord My father had a noble spirit He might think that there would be a selfishness in the appearance had he ask'd of your Lordship a favour Little spirited men sometimes choose to be obliged to relations in hopes that payment will be less rigorously exacted than by a stranger  Ah kinsman kinsmanThat's the white side of the business  Indeed my Lord that would be a motive with me to avoid troubling your Lordship in an exigence were it to happen For mistrusts will arise from possibilities of being ungrateful when perhaps there is no room were the heart to be known for the suspicion  Well said however You are a young man that one need not be afraid to be acquainted with But what would you do as a lender Would you think hardly of a man that wanted to be obliged to  you  O noBut in this case I would be determined by prudence If my friend regarded  himself  as the first person in the friendship  me  but as the second in cases that might hurt my fortune and disable me from acting up to my spirit to other friends I would then let him know that he thought as meanly of my understanding as of my justice  Lord W was delighted with his nephew's notions He over and over prophesied That he would be a great man  Sir Charles with wonderful dispatch executed those designs which he had told Lord W he would carry into effect And the sale of the timber he cut down in Hampshire and which lay convenient for watercarriage for the use of the government furnished him with a very considerable sum  I have mentioned that Sir Charles on his setting out from Florence to Paris to attend his father's leave for his coming to England had left his ward Miss Jervois at the former place in the protection of good Dr Bartlet He soon sent for them both over and placed the young Lady with a discreet widowgentlewoman who had three prudent daughters sometimes indulging her with leave to visit his sisters who are very fond of her as you have heard And now let me add That she is an humble petitioner to me to procure her the felicity as she calls it to be constantly resident with Miss Grandison She will be she says the best girl in the world if she may be allowed this favour And not one word of advice either of her guardian or of Miss Grandison or of Lady L shall be lost upon herAnd besides as good women said she as Mrs Lane and her daughters  are  what protection can women give me were my unhappy mother to be troublesome and resolve to  have me  as she is continually threatening  What a new world opens to me my Lucy from the acquaintance I am permitted to hold with this family God grant that your poor Harriet pay not too dearly for her knowledgeShe  would  I believe you think were she to be  entangled in an hopeless Love  LETTER XXV Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  LORD L came to town from Scotland within two or three months of Sir Charles's arrival in England His first visit was to the young Baronet who on my Lord's avowing his passion for his sister and her acknowledging her esteem for him introduced him to her and put their hands together holding them between both his With pleasure said he I join hands where hearts so worthy are united Do me my Lord the honour from this moment to look upon me as your brother My father I find was a little embarrassed in his affairs He loved his daughters and perhaps was loth that they should too early claim another protection But had he lived to make himself easy I have no doubt but he would have made them happy He has left that duty upon meAnd I will perform it  His sister was unable to speak for joy My Lord's tears were ready to start  My father proceeded Sir Charles in one of his Letters to me acquainted me with the state of your Lordship's affairs Reckon upon my best services Promise engage undertake The brother my Lord hopes to make you easy The sister will make you happy  Miss Charlotte was affected with this seene and she pray'd with her hands and eyes lifted up that God would make his power as large as his heart The whole world would then she said be benefited either by his bounty or his example  Do you wonder now my dear Mr Reeves that Miss Grandison Lady L and Lord L know not how to contain their gratitude when this beneficentminded brother is spoken of  And has not my Charlotte said he turning towards her and looking at Miss Caroline some happy man that she can distinguish by her Love You are  equally  dear to me my sisters Make me your confident Charlotte Your inclinations shall be my choice  Dear Miss Grandison why did you mislead me by your boasts of unreservedness What room was there for reserve to such a brotherAnd yet it is plain you have not let him know all your  heart  and he seems to think so too And now you are uneasy at an hint he has thrown out of that nature  Two months before the marriage Sir Charles put into his sister's hands a paper sealed up Receive these my Caroline said he as from your father's bounty in compliance with what your mother would have wish'd had we been bless'd with her life When you oblige Lord L with one hand make him with the other this present And intitle yourself to all the gratitude with which I know his worthy heart will overflow on  both  occasions I have done but my duty I have performed only an article of the will which I have made in my mind for my father as time was not lent him to make one for himself  He saluted her and withdrew before she broke the seal And when she did she found in it bank notes for  l  She threw herself into a chair and was unable for some time to stir but recovering herself hurried out to find her brother She was told he was in her sister's apartment She found him not there but Charlotte in tears Sir Charles had just left her What ails my Charlotte  O this brother my CarolineThere is no bearing his generous goodness See that deed See that paper that lies upon it She took it up and these were the contents of the paper  "I have just now paid my sister Caroline the sum that I think she would have been intitled to expect from my father's bounty and the family circumstances had life been lent him to settle his affairs and make a will I have an entire confidence in the discretion of my Charlotte And have by the inclosed deed establish'd for her beyond the power of revocation that independency as to fortune to which from my father's death I think her intitled And for this having acted but as an executor I claim no merit but that of having fulfilled the supposed will of either of our parents as either had survived the other Cherish therefore in your grateful heart  their  memory Remember that when you marry you change the name of Grandison Yet with all my pride what is nameLet the man be worthy of you And be he who he will that you intitle to your vows I will embrace him as the brother of"  "Your affectionate "CHARLES GRANDISON"  The deed was for the same sum as he had given her sister and to carry interest  The two sisters congratulated and wept over each other as if distressedTo be sure they  were  distressed  Caroline found out her brother But when she approached him could not utter one word of what she had meditated to say But dropping down on one knee blessed him as she owned in her heart both for Lord L and herself but could only express her gratitude by her lifted up hands and eyes  Just as he had raised and seated her enter'd to them the equally grateful Charlotte He placed her next her sister and drawing a chair for himself taking an hand of each he thus addressed himself to them  My dear sisters you  are  too sensible of these but  due  instances of my brotherly love It has pleased God to take from us our father and mother We are  more  than brothers and sisters and must supply to each other the wanting relations Look upon me only as an executor of a will that  ought  to have been made and perhaps  would  had time been given My circumstances are greater than I expected greater I dare say than my father thought they would be Less than I have done could not be done by a brother who had  power  to do this You don't know how much you will oblige me if you never say one word more on this subject You will act with less dignity than becomes my sisters if you look upon what I have done in any other light than as your due  O my aunt Be so good as to let the servants prepare my apartment at Selbyhouse There is no living within the blazing glory of this man But for one's comfort he seems to have one fault and he owns itAnd yet does not acknowledgment annihilate that faultO no for he thinks not of  correcting  it This fault is  pride  Do you mind  what  a stress he lays nowandthen on the Familyname and as above  Dignity  says he  that becomes my sisters  Proud mortalO my Lucy he  is  proud  too  proud I doubt as well as  too  considerable in his fortunesWhat would I sayYet I know who would  study  to make him the happiest of menSpare me spare me here my uncle or rather skip over this passage Lucy  Sir Charles at the end of eight months from his father's death gave Caroline with his own hand to Lord L  Charlotte had two humble servants Lord G and Sir Walter Watkyns as you have seen in my former Letters but likes not either of them  Lord L carried his Lady down to Scotland where  she was greatly admired and caressed by all his relations How happy for your Harriet was their criticallyproposed return which carried down Sir Charles and Miss Charlotte to prepare everything at Colnebrooke for their reception  Sir Charles accompanied my Lord and Lady L as far on their way to Scotland as York where he made a visit to Mrs Eleanor Grandison his father's maidensister who resides there She having heard of his goodness to his sisters and to everybody else with whom he had concerns longed to see him and on this occasion rejoiced in the opportunity he gave her to congratulate to bless and applaud her nephew  What multitudes of things have I farther to tell you relating to this  strange  man  Let  me call him names  I enquired after the history of the good Dr Bartlett But the Ladies said As they knew not the whole of it they would refer me to the Doctor himself They knew however enough they said to reverence him as one of the most worthy and most pious of men They believed that he knew all the secrets of their brother's heart  Strange methinks that these secrets lie so  deep  Yet there does not seem any thing so  very  forbidding either in Sir Charles or the Doctor but that one might ask them a few innocent questions And yet I did not use to be so very curious neither Why should I be more so than his sistersYet persons coming strangers into a family of extraordinary merit are  apt  I believe to be more inquisitive about the affairs and particularities of that family than those who make a part of it And when they have no other motive for their curiosity than a desire to applaud and imitate I see not any great harm in it  I was also very anxious to know what at so early an age for Sir Charles was not then eighteen were the faults he found with the governor appointed for  him It seems the man was not only profligate himself but in order to keep himself in countenance laid snares for the young gentleman's virtue which however he had the happiness to escape tho' at an age in which youth is generally unguarded This man was also contentious quarrelsome and a drinker and yet as Sir Charles at the time acknowledged to his sisters it had so very indifferent an appearance for a young man to find fault with his governor that as well for the appearancesake as for the man's he was very loth to complain till he became insupportable It was mentioned as it ought greatly to the honour of the young gentleman's frankness and magnanimity that when at last he found himself obliged to complain of this wicked man to his father he gave him a copy of the letter he wrote as soon as he sent it away You may make Sir said he what use you please of the slep I have taken You see my charge I have not aggravated it Only let me caution you that as I have not given you by my own misconduct any advantage over me you do not make a still worse figure in my reply if you give me occasion to justify my charge My father loves his son I  must  be his son An altercation cannot end in your favour  But on enquiry into the behaviour of this bad man who might have tainted the morals of one of the finest youths on earth which the son besought the father to make before he paid any regard to his complaints Sir Thomas dismissed him and made a compliment to his son that he should have no other governor for the future than his own discretion  Miss Jervois's history is briefly this  She had one of the best of fathers Her mother is one of the worst of women A termagant a swearer a drinker unchastePoor Mr JervoisI have told you that he a meek man was obliged to abandon his country to avoid her Yet she wants to have her  daughter under her own tuitionTerribleSir Charles has had trouble with her He expects to have morePoor Miss Jervois  Miss Emily's fortune is very great The Ladies say Not less than  l  Her father was an Italian and Turky merchant and Sir Charles by his management has augmented it to that sum by the recovery of some thousands of pounds which Mr Jervois had thought desperate  AND thus have I brought down as briefly as I was able tho' writing almost night and day and greatly indulged in the latter by the Ladies who saw my heart was in the task the history of this family to the time when I had the happiness by means however most shockingly undesirable to be first acquainted with it  And now a word or two to present situations  Sir Charles is not yet come down Lucy And this is MondayVery wellHe has made excuses by his cousin Grandison who came down with my cousin Reeves on Sunday morning and both went up together yesterdayVastly busy no doubtHe will be here tomorrow I  think  he says His excuses were to his sisters and Lord L I am glad he did not give himself the importance with your Harriet to make any to her on his absence  Miss Grandison complains that I open not my heart to her She wants she says to open hers to me but as she has intricacies that I cannot have I must  begin  She knows not  how  she pretends What her secrets may be I presume not to guess But surely I cannot tell a sister who with  her  sister favours another woman that I have a regard for her brother and that before I can be sure he has any for me  She will play me a trick she just now told me if I will not let her know who the happy man in Northamptonshire  is whom I prefer to all others That there  is  such a one  somewhere  she says she has no doubt And if she find it out before I tell her she will give me  no quarter  speaking in the military phrase which sometimes she is apt to do Lady L smiles and eyes me with great attention when her sister is raillying me as if she also wanted to find out some reason for my refusing Lord D I told them an hour ago that I am beset with their eyes and Lord L's for Lady L keeps no one secret of her heart nor I believe any body's else that she is mistress of from her Lord Him I think of all the men I know my uncle not excepted I could soonest intrust with a secret But have I Lucy any to reveal It is I hope a secret to myself that never will be unfolded even  to  myself that I love a man who has not made professions of Love to me As to Sir Charles GrandisonBut have done Harriet Thou hast named a name that will lead theeWhither will it lead meMore than I am at present my own I am and will be ever my dear Lucy  Your affectionate  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXVI Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Monday Mar  I WILL now tell you who the Lady is to whom the two sisters have given their interest  It is Lady Anne S the only daughter of the Earl of S A vast fortune it seems independent of her father and yet certain of a very great one from him She is to be here this very afternoon on a visit to the two Ladies With all my heart I hope she is a very agreeable Lady I hope she has a capacious mind I  hopeI don't know what to hopeAnd why Because I find myself out to be a selfish wretch and don't wish her to be so fine and so good a woman as I  say  I do Is Love if I  must  own Love a narrower of the HeartI don't know whether while it is in suspense and is only on one side it be not the parent of jealousy envy dissimulation making the person pretend generosity disinterestedness and I cannot tell what but secretly wishing that her rival may not be so worthy so lovely as she pretends to wish her to beAh Lucy were one  sure  one could afford to be  generous  One might then look down with pity upon a rival instead of being mortified with apprehensions of being looked down upon  But I will be just to the education given me and the examples set me Whatever I shall be able to do or to wish while I am in  suspense  when any happy woman becomes the wife of Sir Charles Grandison I will revere her and wish her for his sake as well as her own all the felicities that this world can afford and if I cannot do this from my heart I will disown that heart  The two Ladies set upon Mr Grandison on Sunday to get out of him the business that carried Sir Charles so often of late to Canterbury But tho' he owned that he was not injoined secrecy he affected to amuse them and strangely to romance hinting to them a story of a fine woman in love with  him  and he with  her  yet neither of them thinking of marriage Mr Grandison valued not truth nor scrupled solemn words tho' ludicrously uttered to make the most improbable stuff perplexing and teazing and then the wretch laughed immoderately at the suspense he supposed he had caused  What witless creatures what mere nothings are these beaux fine fellows and laughers of menhow silly must they think us womenAnd how  silly indeed are such of us as can keep in countenance at our own expence their folly  He was left alone with me for half an hour last night and in a very serious manner besought me to receive his addresses I was greatly displeased with the two sisters for I thought they intended to give him this opportunity by their manner of withdrawing Surely thought I I am not sunk so low in the eyes of the Ladies of such a family as this as to be thought by them a fit wise to the only worthless person in it because I have not the fortune of Lady Anne S I will hear thought I what Miss Grandison says to this and altho' I had made excuses to my cousin Reeves's at  their  request for staying here longer than I had intended I will get away to town as fast as I can Proud as they are of the name of Grandison thought I the name  only  won't do with Harriet Byron I am as proud as they  I said nothing of my resentment But told both Ladies the moment I saw them of Mr Grandison's declaration They expressed themselves highly displeased with him for it and said they would talk to him Miss Grandison said She wondered at his  presumption  His fortune was indeed very considerable she said notwithstanding the extravagance of his youth But it was an high degree of confidence in a man of such free principles to think himself intitled to countenance fromin short from such a Lady as your Harriet Lucy whatever you may think of her in these days of her humiliation  She added the goodness of my heart to her compliment I hope it is not a bad one  Then  it was that I told them of my thoughts of going to town on the occasion And the two Ladies instantly went to their cousin and talked to him in such a manner that he promised if no more notice were taken of the matter never again to give occasion for them to reprimand him on this subject He had indeed he  owned no very  strong aspirations  after matrimony and had balanced about it a good while before he could allow himself to declare his passion so seriously But only as it was probable that he might at one time or other enter the  pale  he thought he never in his life saw a woman with whom he could be so happy as with me  But you see Lucy by this address of Mr Grandison that nothing is thought of in the family of  another  nature What makes me a little more affected than otherwise I believe I should be is That all you my dear friends are so much in love with this really great because good man It is a very happy circumstance for a young woman to look forward to a change of condition with a man of whom every one of her relations highly approves But what can't be can't I shall see what merit Lady Anne has byandby But if fortuneIndeed my dear were I the first princess on earth I would have no other man if I might have him And so I say▪ that am but poor Harriet Byron By this time Lady D will have taken such measures I hope as will not disturb me in my resolution It is  fixed  my dear I cannot help it I  must  not I  ought  not I therefore will not give my  hand  whatever has passed between that Lady and my aunt to any man living and leave a preserence in my  heart  against that man Gratitude Justice Virtue Decency all forbid it  And yet as I see no hope nor trace for hope I have begun to attempt the conquest of my  hopeless  What shall I call it  Passion  Well if I must call it so I must A  child in lovematters  if I did not would  find me out  you know Nor will I however  hopeless  be ashamed of owning it if I can help it Is not reason is not purity is not delicacy with me Is it  person  that I am in love with if I  am  in love No It is virtue it is goodness it is generosity it is true politeness that I am captivated by all  centred in this one  good man  What then have I to be ashamed ofAnd yet I  am  a little ashamed nowandthen for all that  After all that Love which is founded on fancy or exterior advantages is a Love I should think that may and oftentimes  ought  to be overcome But that which is founded on interior worth that blazes out when charity beneficence piety fortitude are signally exerted by the object beloved how can such a Love as that be restrained damped suppress'd How can it without damping every spark of generous goodness in what my partial grandmamma calls a  fellowheart  admiring and longing to promote and share in such glorious philantropy  Philantropy  Yes my uncle Why should women in compliance with the petulance of narrowminded men forbear to use words that some seem to think above them when no other single word will equally express their sense It will be said They need not  write  Well then don't let them  read  And carry it a little farther and they may be forbidden to  speak  And every lordly man will then be a Grand Signor and have his mute attendant  But won't you think my heart a little at ease that I can thus trifle I would sain have it be at ease and that makes me give way to any chearful idea that rises to my mind  The Ladies here have made me read to them several passages out of my Letters to you before I send them They are more generous than I think I wish them to be in allowing me to skip and pass over sentences and paragraphs as I please For is not this allowing that I have something to write or have written something that they think I  ought  to keep from their knowledge and which they do not  desire  to know With all my heart I will not be mean Lucy  WELL Lucy Lady Anne has been here and is  gone She is an agreeable woman I can't say but she is  very  agreeable And were she actually Lady Grandison I think I could respect her I  think  I couldBut O my dear friends what an happy creature was I before I came to London  There was a good deal of discourse about Sir Charles She owned that she thought him the handsomest man she ever saw in her life She was in love with his great  character  she said She could go nowhere but he was the subject She had heard of the affair between him and Sir Hargrave and made me an hundred compliments on the occasion and said That her having heard that I was at Clonebrooke was one inducement to her to make this visit  It seems she told Miss Grandison That she thought me the prettiest creature she ever beheld  Creature  was her wordWe are all creatures 'tis true But I think I never was more displeased with the sound of the word  Creature  than I was from Lady Anne  MY aunt's Letter relating to what passed between her and Lady D is just brought me  And so Lady D was greatly chagrinedI am sorry for it But my dear aunt you say that she is not displeased with me in the main and commends my sincerity That I hope is but doing me justice I am very glad to find that she knew not how to get over my prepossession in favour of another man It was worthy of herself and of my Lord D's character I shall always respect her I hope this affair is quite over  My grandmamma regrets the uncertainty I am in But did she not say herself that Sir Charles Grandison was too considerable in his fortune in his merit That we were but as the private he the public in this particular What room is there then for regret  Why is the word  uncertainty  used We may be  certain  And there's an end of it His sisters can railly me  "Some happy man in Northamptonshire"As much as to say "You must not think of our brother" "Lady Anne S has a vast fortune"  Is not that saying  "What hope can  you  have Harriet Byron"  Well I don't care This life is but a passage a short passage to a better And let one jostle and another elbow another push me because they know the weakest must give way yet I will endeavour steadily to pursue my course till I get thro' it and into broad and open day  One word only more on this subjectThere is but one man in the world whom I can honestly marry my mind continuing what it is His I cannot expect to be I must then of necessity be a single woman as long as I live Well And where is the great evil of that Shall I not have less cares less anxietiesI  shall  And let me beg of my dear friends that none of you will ever again mention marriage to  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXVII Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Tuesday March  SIR Charles is come at last He came time enough to breakfast and with him the good Dr Bartlett My philosophy I doubt is gone again quite gone for one while at least I must take sanctuary and that very soon at Selbyhouse  Every word that passes now seems to me worth repeating There is no describing how the presence of this man animates every one in company But take only part of what passed  We were in hopes Sir Charles said Lord L that we should have had the pleasure of seeing you before now  My heart was with you my Lord And taking my hand for he sat next me and bowing the more ardently I must own for the pleasure I should have shared with you all in the company of this your lovely guest  What business had he to take my hand But indeed the character of  brother  might warrant the freedom  I was engaged most part of last week in a very melancholy attendance as Mr Grandison could have informed you  But not a word of the matter said Mr Grandison did I tell the Ladies looking at his two cousins I amused them as they love to do all mankind when they have power  The Ladies I hope cousin will punish you for this reflexion  I came not to town till Saturday proceeded Sir Charles and found a billet from Sir Hargrave Pollexfen inviting himself Mr Merceda Mr Bagenhall and Mr Jordan to pass the Sunday evening with me at St James'ssquare The company was not suitable to the day nor the day to the purposed meeting I made my excuses and desired them to favour me at breakfast on monday morning They came And when we were all in good humour with one another I proposed and was seconded by Mr Jordan that we would make a visitYou will hardly guess to whom Miss ByronIt was to the widow Awberry at Paddington  I started and even trembled What I suffered there was all in my mind  He proceeded then to tell me that he had tho' not without some difficulty on Sir Hargrave's part engaged him to draw upon his banker for the  l  he had promised Wilson on Mr Merceda on his banker  for  l  and he himself generously added  l  more and giving as he said the air of a frolick to the performance of a promise they all of them went to Paddington There satisfying themselves of the girl's love for Wilson and of the widow's opinion of Wilson's good intentions by the girl they let them know that the sum of  l  was deposited in Sir Charles's hands to be paid on the day of marriage as a portion for the young woman and bid them demand it as soon as they thought fit Neither Wilson nor the widow's son was there The widow and her daughters were overjoy'd at this unexpected good news  They afterwards shew'd Sir Charles it seems every scene of my distress and told him and the gentlemen all but Sir Hargrave who had not patience to hear it and went into another room my whole sad story Sir Charles was pleased to say That he was so much affected with it that he had some little difficulty on joining Sir Hargrave to be as civil to him as he was before he heard the relation  To one condition it seems the gentlemen insisted Sir Charles should consent as an inducement for them to comply with his proposal It was that Sir Charles should dine with Sir Hargrave and the company at his house on the forest some one day in the next week of which they would give him notice They all insisted upon it and Sir Charles said he came the more readily into the proposal as they declared it would be the last time they should see him for at least a twelvemonth to come they being determined to prosecute their intended tour  Wilson and young Awberry waited on Sir Charles the same evening The marriage is to be celebrated in a few days Wilson says that his widowsister in Smithfield will he is sure admit him into a partnership with her now that he shall have something to carry into the stock for she loves his wiseelect and  the saving both of body and soul will be owing he declared with transport that left him speechless to Sir Charles Grandison  Everybody was delighted with the relation he gave Dear Sir Charles said Mr Grandison let me be allowed to believe the Roman Catholic doctrine of Supererogation and let me express my hope that I your kinsman may be the better for your good works If all you do is but necessary the Lord have mercy upon me  Miss Grandison said if I had written to my friends the account of what I suffered from the vile attempt of Sir Hargrave as she doubted not but I had Lady L as well as herself would take it for a particular mark of my confidence if they might be allowed to peruse it  When I am favoured reply'd I with the return of my Letters I will very chearfully communicate to you my dear Ladies my relation of this shocking affair  They all expressed a pleasure in my frankness Sir Charles said he admired me beyond expression for that noble criterion of Innocence and goodness  There Lucy  I think there is nothing in that part but what they may see  LETTER XXVIII Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  THE two sisters and Lord L were then solicitous to know what was the occasion which he called melancholy that had engaged his attendance so many days at Canterbury  It is  really  a melancholy occasion reply'd he You must not be surprised my Lord nor you my sisters if you see me in mourning in a few days His sisters  started And so  truly  must I But I am his third sister you know He seemed in haste to explain himself left he should keep us in painful suspense My journeyings to Canterbury have been occasioned by the melancholy necessity of visiting a sick friend who is now no more  You had all such an opinion said Mr Grandison that I could keep no secret that  You were resolved interrupted Miss Grandison to say anything but the truth Indeed cousin you had better have been silent at this timeIs there a necessity brother for  us  to go into mourning  There is not I had a true value for the departed But custom will oblige me to mourn outwardly as an  executor  only And I have given orders about that and other necessary matters  Did we know the deceased gentleman brother said Lady L  No His name was Danby He was an eminent merchant an Englishman but from his youth settled in France He had for months been in a languishing state of health and at last finding his recovery desperate was desirous to die in his native country He landed at Dover about two months ago But his malady so greatly increased that he was obliged to stop at Canterbury in his way to town and there at last he yielded to the common destiny The body was to be brought to town as this night I have order'd it to an undertaker's I must lock myself up for a day or two when I go to town His concerns are large but he told me not intricate He desired that his will might not be opened 'till after his interrment and that that might be private He has two nephews and a niece I would have had him join them in the trust with me But he refused to do so An attempt once had been made upon his life by villains set at work by a wicked brother father of those nephews and that niece of which they were innocent They  are worthy young people I had the happiness to save his life But had no merit in it for my own safety was involved in his I am afraid he has been too grateful  But my good brother said Miss Grandison were you not a little reserved on this occasion You went and returned and went and returned to Canterbury and never said one word to us of the call you had to go thither For my part I thought there was a Lady in the case I do assure you  My reserve as you call it Charlotte was rather accidental than designed and yet I do nowandthen treat your agreeable curiosity as mariners are said to do a whale I throw out a tub But this was too melancholy an occasion to be sported with I was affected by it Had the gentleman lived to come to town you would all have been acquainted with him I love to communicate pleasure but not pain when especially no good end can be answered by the communication I go to different places and return and hardly think it worth troubling my sisters with every movement Had I thought you had any curiosity about my little journeyings to Canterbury you should have had it answered And yet I know my sister Charlotte loves to puzzle and find out secrets where none are intended  She blush'd and so did I Your servant Sir was all she said  But Charlotte proceeded he you thought it was a  Lady  that I visited You know not your brother I never will keep a secret of that nature from  you  my good Lord nor from  you  my sisters when I find myself either encouraged or inclined to make a second visit It is for  your  Sex Charlotte to be very chary of such secrets and reason good if you have any doubt either of the man's worthiness or of your own consequence with him  He looked very earnestly at her but smiled  So my brother I thank you humourously rubbing one side of her face tho' she needed not to do so to make both cheeks glow this is another box on the same car I have been uneasy I can tell you Sir at an hint you threw out before you last went to Canterbury as if I kept you from something that it behoved you to know Now pray Sir will you be pleased to explain yourself  And since you put it so strongly to me Charlotte let me ask you Have you not  And let me ask you SirDo you think I have  Perhaps Charlotte your solicitude on this subject now and the alarm you took at the time on a very slight hint might warrant  No  warrants  brotherPray be so good as to speak all that lies on your mind  Ah Charlotte and looked tho' smilingly with meaning  I will not bear this  Ah Charlotte  and that meaning look  And are you willing my dear to try this cause  I demand my tryal  Charming innocence thought I at the timeNow shall I find some fault I hope in this almost perfect brother I triumphed in my mind for my Charlotte  Who shall be your judge  Yourself Sir  God grant you may be found guilty cousin said Mr Grandison for your plaguing of me  Has that wretch looking at Mr Grandison insinuated anythingShe stopt  Are you afraid my sister  I would not give that creature any advantage over me  Sir Ch  I think I would if there were fair roomYou have too often all the game in your own hands You should allow Mr Grandison his chance  Miss Gr  Not to arise from such an observing bystander as my brother  Sir Ch  Conscious Charlotte  Miss Gr  May be not  Sir Ch May be  is doubtful May be  No  implies May be  Yes  Lady L  You have made Charlotte uneasy Indeed brother you have The poor girl has been harping upon this string ever since you have been gone  Sir Ch  I am sorry what I said pressed so hardDo  you  Lady L if this delinquency comes to tryal offer yourself as an advocate for Charlotte  Lady L  I know not an act of delinquency she has committed  Sir Ch  The act of delinquency is thisShall I Charlotte explain myself  Miss Gr  Teazing man How can you  Mr Grandison rubbed his hands and rejoiced Miss Grandison was nettled She gave Mr Grandison  such  a lookI never saw such a contemptuous onePray Sir do you withdraw if you please  Mr Gr  Not I by the Mass Are you afraid of a tryal in open Court Oho cousin Charlotte  Miss Gr  Have I not a  cruel  brother Miss Byron  Lord L  Our sister Charlotte really suffers Sir Charles  Sir Ch  I am sorry for it The  innocent  should not suffer We will drop the cause  Lady L  Worse and worse brother  Sir Ch  How so Lady L Is not Charlotte innocent  Dr Bartlett  If an advocate be required and you Sir Charles are judge and not a pleader in this cause I offer myself to Miss Grandison  Sir Ch  A very powerful one she will then have You think her cause a just one Doctor by your offer  Will you Charlotte give Dr Bartlett a brief Or  have  you given him one▪  Dr Bart  I have no doubt of the justice of the cause  Sir Ch  Nor of the justice of the  accuser  I hope I cannot be a  judge  in it  Lady L  Nay then▪Poor Charlotte  Miss Gr  I wish cousin Grandison you would withdraw  Mr Gr  I wish cousin Charlotte you would  not  wish it  Miss Gr  But are you serious brother  Sir Ch  Let us call another cause sister if you please Pray my Lord what visitors have you had since I had the honour to attend you  Miss Gr  Nay brotherDon't think  Sir Ch  BE QUIET Charlotte  Lady L  Your own words sisterBut we had a visit from Lady Anne S yesterday  I was glad to hear Lady L say this But nothing came of it  Sir Ch  You have seen Lady Anne more than once my Emily How do you like Lady Anne  Miss Emily  Very well Sir She is a very agreeable Lady Don't you think so Sir  Sir Ch  I doBut Charlotte and looked tenderly upon her I must not have you uneasy  She sat vexedher complexion raised and playing with a lump of sugar and sometimes twirling round and round a teacup for the teathings thro' earnestness of talking were not taken away tho' the servants were withdrawn  Mr Gr  Well I will leave you together I think Poor cousin CharlotteRising he tapped her shoulder Poor cousin Charlotte Ha ha ha hah  Miss Gr  Impertinence with a look the fellow to that she gave him before  Miss Emily  I will withdraw if you please madam rising and courtesying  Miss Grandison nodded her assent And Emily withdrew likewise  Dr Bartlett offer'd to do so Miss Grandison seem'd not to disapprove of his motion But Sir Charles said▪ The Doctor is retained on your part Charlotte He must hear the charge Shall Miss Byron be judge  I begged to be excused The matter began to look like earnest  Miss Gr  whispering me I wish Harriet I had opened my whole heart to you Your nasty scribbling Eternally at your pen or I had  Then I began to be afraid for her Dear Miss Grandison rewhisper'd I it was not for me to obtrudeDear Miss Grandison my pen should never have interfered if  Miss Gr  still whispering One should be courted out of some sort of secrets One is not very forward to begin some sort of discoursesYet the subjects most in our hearts perhaps But don't despise me You see what an accuser I have And so generous a one too that one must half condemn one's self at setting out  Harriet  whispering Fear nothing my Charlotte You are in brother's hands  Miss Gr  Well Sir Charles and now if you please for the charge But you say you cannot be judge and accuser Who shall be judge  Sir Ch  Your own heart Charlotte I desire all present to be your advocates if their judgment be with you And if it be  not  that they will pity you in silence  He looked smilingly serious Good Heaven thought I  Miss Gr  Pity meNay thenBut pray Sir your charge  Sir Ch  The matter is too serious to be spoken of in metaphor  Miss Gr  Good GodHemand twice more she hemm'dPray Sir begin Begin while I have breath  Lord and Lady L and Dr Bartlett and I look'd very grave and Miss Grandison look'd in general  fretfully humble  if I may so express myself And everything being removed but the table she play'd with her diamond ring sometimes pulling it off and putting it on sometimes putting the tip of her finger in it as it lay upon the table and turning it round and round swister or slower and stopping thro' downcast vexation or earnest attention as she found herself more or less affectedWhat a sweet confusion  Sir Ch  You know my dear Charlotte that I very early after my arrival enquired after the state of your heart You told me it was absolutely free  Miss Gr  Well Sir  Sir Ch  Not satisfied with your own acknowledgement as I knew that young Ladies I know not why when  proper  persons make enquiries and for motives not ungenerous are too apt to make secrets of a passion that is not in itself illaudable I asked your elder sister who scrupled not to own hers whether there was any one man whom you preferred to anotherShe assured me that she knew not of any one  Lady L  My sister knows that I said truth  Miss Gr  Well well Lady L nobody doubts your veracity  Sir Ch  Dear Charlotte keep your temper  Miss Gr  Pray Sir proceedAnd the ring turn'd round very fast  Sir Ch  On several occasions I put the same question and had the same assurances My reason for  repeating  my question was owing to an early intelligenceOf which more byandby  Miss Gr  Sir  Sir Ch  And that I might either provide the money that I thought due to her as my sister or take time to pay it according to the circumstances of her engagement and take from her all apprehensions of controul in a case that might affect the happiness of her lifeThese and brotherly Love were the motives of my enquiry  Miss Gr  Your generosity Sir was without example  Sir Ch  Not so I hope My sisters had an  equitable  if not a  legal  right to what has been done I found on looking into my affairs that by a moderate calculation of the familycircumstances no man should think of addressing a daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison without supposing himself intitled either by his merits or fortune to expect  l  with herAnd this even allowing to the Son the customary preferences given to men as men tho' given for the sake of pride perhaps rather than natural justice For does not tyrant custom make a daughter change  her  name in marriage and give to a son for the sake of  name  only the estate of the common ancestor of both  This generous hint affected me It was nearly my own case you know I might otherwise have been a rich heiress and might have had as strong pretensions to be distinguished by the Grandisons for my fortune as any Lady S in the kingdom But worthless as those are to whom for the sake of the name my father's estate is passed I never grudged it to them till I came acquainted with these Grandisons  Lord L  But who Sir Charles but you  Sir Ch  Pray my Lord let not your generosity mislead you to think that a favour which is but a due We shall not be judged by comparison The Laws of Truth and Justice are always the same What others would not have done in the like situation that let  them look to But what is the  mortal  man who should make an unjust advantage of  mortality  Miss Grandison pulled out her handkerchief put it to her eyes and then in her lap and putting half on and half off by turns her ring looked nowandthen at me as if she wished me to pity her  Indeed Lucy I did pity her Every one did and so did her judge I dare say in his heart But justice my Lucy is a severe thing Who can bear a tryal if the integrity and greatness of this man's heart is to be the rule by which their actions are to be examined Yet you shall hear how generous he was  Sir Ch  Allow me for Miss Byron's sake who has been but lately  restored  to our family to be a little more particular than otherwise I need to be I had not been long in England before Sir Walter Watkyns desired my interest with my sister I told him That she was entirely her own mistress and that I should not offer to lead her choice Lord G made his court to her likewise and applying to me received the same answer  I enter'd however into serious talk with my sister upon this subject She ask'd me what I thought of each gentleman I told her frankly  Miss Gr  And pray brother be so good as to repeat what you said of them Let Miss Byron be judge whether either of the portraits was very inviting  Sir Ch  I told her Miss Byron that Sir Walter would I presumed be thought the handsomer man of the two He was gay lively genteel and had that courage in his air and manner that Ladies were seldom displeased with I had not however discovered any great depth in him My sister I imagined if she married him would have the superiority in good sense But I question'd whether Sir Walter would easily find that out or allow it if he did He  was a brisk man for an hour and might have wit and sense too but indeed I hardly ever saw him out of Ladies company and he seemed to be of opinion that flash rather than fire was what would recommend him to them Sometimes I have thought I told her that women of sense should punish such men with their contempt and not reward them with their approbation for thus indirectly affronting their understandings But that I had known women of sense approve a man of that character and each woman must determine for herself what appeared most agreeable to her  Miss Gr  whispering Well Harriet  Har  whispering Don t interrupt him  Sir Ch  You remember my dear Charlotte that it was in this kind of way I spoke about Sir Walter Watkyns and added That he was independent in possession of the familyestate which I believed was a good one and that he talked handsomely to me of settlements  I do remember this said Miss Grandison and whispering me I am afraid said she he knows too much but the  person  he cannot knowWell Sir and pray be pleased to repeat what you said of Lord G  Sir Ch  Lord G told you was a gaydressing man but of a graver cast than the other The fashion rather than his inclination seemed to govern his outward appearance He was a modest man and I feared had too much doubt of himself to appear with that dignity in the eye of a lively woman which should give him a first consequence with her  Miss Gr  Your servant Sir  Sir Ch  I believed he would make a good husband So perhaps might Sir Walter But the one would  bear  and the other perhaps must be  borne with  Ladies as well as men I presumed had some soibles that they would not care to part with As to fortune I added  that Lord G was dependent on his father's pleasure He had indeed his father's entire approbation I found in his address And I hoped that a sister of mine would not wish for any man's death for the sake of either title or fortune You have seen Lord G Miss Byron  Har  What Sir Charles was Miss Grandison's answer  I did not care to give any opinion that might either  hurt  or  humour  my Charlotte  Sir Ch  Charlotte told me in so many words That she did not approve of either Each gentleman said I has besought me to be his advocate A task that I have not undertaken I only told them That I would talk to my sister upon the subject But did not think a brother ought to expect an influence over a sister where the gentlemen suspected their own You will remember said I to my sister that women cannot choose where they will and that the same man cannot be everythingShe desired me to tell her which of the two  I  would preferFirst said I▪ let me repeat the question I have more than once put to youHave you any the least shadow of a preference in your heart to any third personWhat was my sister's answer She said She had not And yet had I not had the private intelligence I hinted at I should have been apt to imagine that I had some reason to repeat the question from the  warmth  both of  manner  and  accent  with which she declared that she approved of neither Women I believe do not with  earnestness  reject a man who is not  quite  disagreeable and to whose quality and fortune there can be no objection if they are absolutely unprejudiced in another's favour  We women look'd upon one another I have no  doubt  thought I but Sir Charles came  honestly  by his knowlege of us The dear Charlotte sat uneasy He proceeded  However I now made no question but my sister's affections were absolutely disengaged My dear Charlotte said I I would rather be excused telling you which gentleman's suit I should incline to favour lest my opinion should not have your inclination with it and your mind by that means should suffer any embarrasment She desired to know it  Miss Gr  You were very generous Sir I owned you were in this point as well as in all others  Sir Ch  I then declared in savour of Lord G as the man who would be most likely to make her happy who would think himself most obliged to her for her favour And I took the liberty to hint that tho' I admired her for her vivacity and even when her wit carried its keenest edge loved to be awakened by it and wished it never to lose that edge yet I imagined that it would  hurt  such a man as Sir Walter Lord G it would  enliven  And I hoped if she took pleasure in her innocent fallies that she would think it  something  so to choose as that she should not be under a necessity of repressing those sprightly powers that  very seldom  were to be wished to be reined in  Miss Gr  True Sir You said  very seldom  I remember  Sir Ch  I never will flatter either a prince or a Lady yet should be sorry to treat either of them rudely She then asked me after my  own  inclinations I took this for a desire to avoid the subject we were upon and would have  withdrawn  but not in illhumour There was no reason for it My sister was not obliged to follow me in a subject that was not agreeable to her But I took care to let her know that  her  question was not a disagreeable one to  me  But would be more properly answered on some other occasion She would have had me to stayFor the sake of the former subject do you ask me to stay Charlotte No said she  Well then my dear take time to consider of it and at some other opportunity we will resume it Thus tender did I  intend  to be with regard to my sister's inclinations  Miss Grandison wiped her eyesAnd said but with an accent that had a little peevishness in it You wanted not Sir all this preparation Nobody has the shadow of belief that  you  could be wrong  Sir Ch  If this Charlotte be well said if in that accent it be  generously  said I have doneAnd from my heart acquit you and as cordially condemn myself if I have appeared in your eye to intend to raise my own character at the expence of yours Believe me Charlotte I had much rather in a point of delicacy that the brother should be found faulty than the sister And let it pass that I am soAnd only tell me in what way you would with me to serve you  Miss Gr  Pardon me brother You can add forgiveness to the other obligations under which I labour I was petulent  Sir Ch  I do most cordially I do  Miss Gr  wiping her eyes But won't you proceed  Sir  Sir Ch  At another opportunity  madam  Miss Gr  MADAM▪Nay now you are indeed angry with me Pray proceed  Cir Ch  I am not But you shall allow me an hour's conversation with you in your dressingroom when you please  Miss Gr  NoPray proceed Every one here is dear to me Every one present must hear either my acquittal or condemnation Pray Sir proceedMiss Byron pray sit stillPray for we were all rising to go out keep your seats I believe I have been wrong My brother said you must pity me in silence if you found me faulty Perhaps I shall be obliged to you for your pityPray Sir be pleased to acquaint me with what you know of my faults  Sir Ch  My dear Charlotte I have said enough to point your fault to your own heart If you know it  that  I hope is sufficientDo not imagine my dear that I want to controul youButHe stopt  Miss Gr  BUT  what  SirPray SirAnd she trembled with eagerness  Sir Ch  But it was not right toAnd yet O that I were mistaken in this point and my sister not wrong  Miss Gr  Well Sir you have reason I suppose to thinkthere she stopt  Sir Ch  That there is a man whom you can approve ofnotwithstanding  Miss Gr  All I have said to the contrary Well Sir if there be it is a great fault to have denied it  Sir Ch  That is all I meanIt is no fault in you to prefer one man to another It is no fault in you to give this preference to any man without consulting your brother I proposed that you should be entirely mistress of your own conduct and actions It would have been ungenerous in me to have supposed you accountable to me who had done no more than my duty by you Dear Charlotte do not imagine  capable of laying such a load on your free will But I should not have been made to pronounce to Lord G and even to the Earl his father on their enquirie  whether your affections were or were not engaged▪ in such a manner as gave them hopes of succeeding  Miss Gr  Are you sure Sir  Sir Ch  O my sister how hard fought now must I say is this battleI can urge it no farther For  your  sake I can urge it no farther  Miss Gr  Name your man Sir  Sir Ch  Not  my  man CharlotteCaptain Anderson is not  my  man  He arose and taking her motionless hand pressed it with his lipsBe not too much disturbed said he I am distress'd my sister for your distressI think  more than I am for the error And saying this bowing to her he withdrew  He saw and pitied her confusion She was quite confounded It was very good of him to withdraw to give her time to recover herself Lady L gave her her salts Miss Grandison hardly ever wanted salts before  O what a poor creature am I said she even in my own eyes Don't despise me HarrietDr Bartlett can you excuse me for so  sturdy  a perseveranceMy Lord forgive meLady L be indulgent to a sister's fault But my brother will always see me in this depreciating light "A battle hard fought" indeed How one error persisted in produces another  When Sir Charles heard her voice as talking every one soothing and pitying her he returned She would have risen with a disposition seemingly as if she would have humbled herself at his feet But he took her folded hands in one of his and with the other drew a chair close to her and sat down With what sweet majesty and mingled compassion in his countenance Miss Grandison's  consciousness  made it terrible  only  to herForgive me Sir were her words  Dear Charlotte I do We have all something to be forgiven for We pity others then most cordially when we want pity ourselves Remember only in the cases of other persons to soften the severity of your virtue  He had Mrs Oldham in his thoughts as we all afterwards concluded  We know not said he to what  inconveniencies  a small departure from principle will lead And now let us look forward But first Had you rather shew me into your dressingroom  Miss Gr  I have now no wish to conceal anything from the persons present I will only withdraw for a few moments  She went out I followed her And then wanting somebody to divide her fault with the dear Charlotte blamed my  nasty  scribbling again But for that said she I should have told you all  And what my dear would that have done returned IThat would not have prevented  No But yet you might have given me your advice I should have had the benefit of that and my confessions would have been then perhaps aforehand with hi  accusationsBut forgive me Harriet  O my Charlotte thought I to myself could you but reinin your charming spirit a little a  very  little you would not have had two forgivenesses to ask instead of one  LETTER XXIX Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  MISS Grandison desired me to return to the company I did She soon followed me took her seat and with an air of mingled dignity and concern deliver'd herself after this manner  If it be not too late after a perseverance in error so obstinate to reinstate myself in my brother's good opinion dearer to me than that of the whole world besides my ingenuousness shall make atonement for that error  Sir Ch  I would spare my sister the  Miss Gr  I will not be spared SirPray hear meI would not in order to extenuate my own faults I hope I have not many seek to throw blame upon the absent much less upon the  everlastingly  absent And yet my brother's piety must not be offended if I am obliged to say something that may seem to cast a shade on a memoryBe not hurt SirI will be favourable to that memory and just to my own fault You  Harriet would no more excuse me than my brother if I failed in either  I bowed and blushed Sir Charles look'd at me with a benign aspect  My  father  proceeded she thought fit to be or to  seem  to be displeased with something that passed between him and Lord L on the application made by my Lord to him for my sister  Sir Ch  He was not willing perhaps that a treaty of marriage should be begun but at his own first motion however unexceptionable the man or the proposal  Miss Gr  Every one knows that my father had great abilities and they were adorned with vivacity and spirit that whereever pointed there was no resisting He took his two daughters to task upon this occasion and being desirous to discourage in them at that time any thoughts of marriage he exerted besides his authority on this occasion which I can truly say had  due  weight with us both that vein of humour and raillery for which he was noted insomuch that his poor girls were confounded and unable to hold up their heads My sister in particular was made to be ashamed of a passion that surely no young woman the object so worthy ought to be ashamed of My father also thought sit perhaps for wise reason to acquaint us that he designed for us but small fortunes And this depreciated me with myself My sister had a stronger mind and had better prospects I could not but apprehend from what my sister suffer'd what must be  my  sufferings in turn and I thought I could be induced to take any step however rash where virtue was not to be wounded rather than undergo what she underwent from the raillery of a man so lively and so humorous and who stood in so venerable a degree of relation to me While these impressions were strong in my mind Captain Anderson who was quarter'd near us had an opportunity to fall  into my company at an assembly He is a sprightly man and was well received by everybody and particularly a favourite of three young ladies who could hardly be civil to each other on his account And this I own when he made assiduous court to me in preference to them and to every other woman gave him some consequence with me And then being the principal officer in that part of the country he was caressed as if he were a general A daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison was deemed a prize worthy of his ambition by everybody as well as by himself While this poor daughter dreading the difficulties that her sister had met with and being led to think by what her father declared to both sisters that two or three thousand pounds would be the height of her fortune had only to apprehend that a captain either of horse or foot who had been perhaps for years a frequenter of public places both in town and country in hopes of raising his fortune would think himself but poorly paid for his pains were she even to obtain her father's pardon should she engage without waiting for his consent as she was urged to do by letter which he found ways unsuspectedly to send herI hope Sir I hope my Lord and you my two sisters that you will  now  from what I have said acquit me of insincerity tho' you cannot of  past  indiscretion  Nevertheless my pride at times was piqued Sometimes I declared off at other times was prevailed upon by arts which men are masters of to go on again till I found myself entangled and at a loss to know how to go either backward or forward The gentleman was indeed of a genteel family But the object of my sister's regard had so much to be said for  him  stood so well with my brother and even with my father was so much the man of quality in every respect that a rash step in me would be look'd upon as the more disgraceful on that account And I could  not but apprehend that if I married Captain Anderson I must be pitied rejected scorned for one while if not for ever  And what title often thought I when I permitted myself seriously to think have I to give my father a  son  my brother my sister my Lord L should he and my sister marry a  brother  whom they would not have chosen nor will probably ownHave they not a  right  to reject him as  their  relation And shall Charlotte Grandison the daughter of the most prudent of mothers take a step that shall make her be looked upon as the disgrace of her family Shall  she  be obliged to follow a soldier's fortune into different quarters and perhaps to distant regions  Such as these were at times my reasonings and perhaps they wouldhave had the less force with me had I in giving myself an  husband  had none of these relations living on whom to obtrude a new one to their dislike by my marriage  Hence I could not bear to reveal the matter to my sister who in  her  choice had so much advantage over me I thought within these few weeks past I could reveal it to my newfound sister and it was one of my motives to come hither at your invitation Lord and Lady L when you told me she was so obliging as to accompany you down But she was  everlastingly  writing and I was shy of  forcing  an opportunity as none agreeably offer'd  Sir Ch  I would not interrupt you CharlotteBut may I ask if this whole affair was carried on by letter Did you not sometimes see each other  Miss Gr  We did But our meetings were not frequent because he was at one time quarter'd in Scotland at another was sent to Ireland where he staid six or seven months at others in distant parts of the kingdom  Sir Ch  In what part of the king's dominions is the Captain now  Miss Gr  Dear Sir could not the person who acquainted you with the affair inform you of that  Sir Ch  smiling The person  could  madam and  did  He is in London  Miss Gr  I hope my brother after the freedom of my confession and an ingenuousness that is not often found in such cases as  this  will not be so unkind as to imagine that I ought to have traps laid for me as if I were not now at last frank and unreserved  Sir Ch  Exceedingly just Charlotte exceedingly justI beg your pardon I said we had all something to be forgiven for I am not however questioning you with intent to  cast a stone  but to  lend you a hand  Miss Gr  O that we had had liberty granted to us having  such  a brother to correspond with himHappy shall I be if I can atone  There she stopt  Sir Ch  Proceed with your story my dear CharlotteGreatly does the atonement overbalance the fault  Miss Gr  bowing to her brother Captain Anderson  is  in town I have seen him twice I was to have seen him at the play had I not come down to Colnebrooke Not a tittle of the truth will I hide from you Now I have recover'd the right path not one wry step will I again willingly take I have suffer'd enough by those I had taken tho' I endeavour'd to carry it off as well as I could even sometimes by a spirit of bravery when it lay heavy  here  putting her hand to her heart  Sir Charles rose from his seat and taking one of his sister's hands between both his Worthy sister Amiable Charlotte After this noble frankness I must not permit you to accuse yourself An error gracefully acknowledged is a victory won If you think Captain Anderson worthy of  your  heart he  shall have a place in  mine  and I will use my interest with Lord and Lady L to allow of his relation to  them  Miss Byron and Dr Bartlett will look upon him as their friend  He sat down again his countenance shining with brotherly love  Miss Gr  O Sir what shall I say You add to my difficulties by your goodness I have told you how I had entangled myself Captain Anderson's address began with hopes of a great fortune▪ which he imagined a daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison could not sail first or last to have That this was his principal motive has been on many occasions on too many for his advantage visible to me  My  allowance of his address as I have hinted was owing to my apprehensions that I should not be a fortune worthy of a more generous man At that time our life was a confined one and I girlishly wished for LibertyMATRIMONY and LIBERTYGirlish connexion as I have since thought  We could none of us help smiling at this lively fally But she went on more seriously  I thought at first that I could break with him when I would But he holds me to it and the more since he has heard of your goodness to me and builds great hopes of future preferment on the alliance  Sir Ch  But do you not love Captain Anderson my sister  Miss Gr  I believe I love him as well as he loves me His principal view as I have said has come out avowedly to be my fortune If I regulate my esteem for him by his for me I ought not for the very reason that he likes me to approve of him  Sir Ch  I do not wonder that the Captain is serious to  hold you to it  to use your words But my dear Charlotte answer me Have you had less liking to Captain Anderson since your fortune is ascertained and absolutely in your own power than you had before  Miss Gr  Not on  that  account if I know my heart But he has been a much more earnest suiter since your goodness to me was generally known than before When public report had made me absolutely dependent on my brother and diminished beyond the truth as it has proved the circumstances of the family and when my sister and I were unhappy between our fears and our hopes I then heard but little from Captain Anderson and that little was  so  prudent and  so  coldBut I had found out the man before  Lord and Lady L with warmth of voice called him unworthy man I thought him so and so by his looks did Dr Bartlett  Sir Ch  Poor manHe seems to have been too prudent to trust even to providence But what my sister  are now  your difficulties  Miss Gr  They proceed from my folly Captain Anderson appeared to me at first a man of sense as well as an agreeable man in his person and air He had a lively and easy elocution  He  spoke without doubt and  I  had therefore the less doubt of his understanding The man who knows how to say agreeable things to a woman in an agreeable manner has her vanity on his side since to doubt his veracity would be to question her own merit When he came to  write  my judgment was even still more engaged in his favour than before But when he thought himself on a  safe footing  with me he then lost his handwriting and his stile and even his orthography I blush to say it and I then blushed to see it  Sir Ch  Men will be men It is natural for us when we find out our imperfections to endeavour to supply them or to gloss them over to those whose good opinion of us we wish to engage I have known men who are not so  ready  as the Captain seems to have been to find out their own defects Captain Anderson perhaps lost his letterwriter by  the shifting of quarters But it is strange that a man of family as the Captain is should be so very illiterate  Miss Gr  His early wildnesses as I afterwards heard made him run from school before he had acquired common schoollearning His friends bought him a pair of colours That was all they would ever do for him And his father marrying a second wife by whom he had children considered not him as one This came out to be his story But he displayed himself to me in very different lights He pretended to have a pretty estate which tho' not large was wellconditioned and capable of improvement besides very considerable expectations A mind that would not impose on another must least bear to be imposed upon himself But I could not help  despising  him when I found myself so grosly imposed upon by the letters he had procured to be written for him and that he was not either the man of sense or learning that he would have had me think him  Sir Ch  But what was the  safe footing  my sister that he thought he was upon with you  Miss Gr  O Sir while all these good appearances held in his favour he had teazed me into a promise And when he had gained that point▪  then  it was or  soon after  that he wrote to me with his own hand And yet tho' he convinced me by doing so that he had  before  employed another it was a point agreed upon that our intercourse was to be an absolute secret and I trembled to find myself exposed to his scribe a man I knew not and who must certainly despise the lover whom he helped to all his agreeable flourishes and in despising  him  must probably despise  me  Yet I  will  say that my letter were such as I can submit to the severest eye It was indeed giving him encouragement enough that I answered him by pen and ink and he presumed enough upon it or he  had never dared to teaze me for a promise as he did for months before I made him one  Sir Ch  Women should never be drawnin to fetter themselves by promises On the contrary they ought always to despise and directly to break with the man who offers to exact a promise from them To what end is a promise of this kind endeavoured to be obtained if the urger suspects not the fitness of his addresses in the eyes of those who have a right to be consulted and if he did not doubt either his own merit or the lady's honour and discretionTherefore wanted to put it out of her own power to be dutiful or if she had begun to swerve by listening to a clandestine address to recover herself Your father my dear but you might not know that could have absolved you from this promise  Numb xxx  You have not now however anybody to controul you You are absolutely your own mistress And I see not but a promiseBut pray of what nature was this promise  Miss Gr  O my follyI declared that I never would marry any other man without his consent while he was single By this means to my confusion I own that I made him my father my guardian my brother at least I made the influences over me of such of them as had been living of no avail in the most material article of my life teazed as I told you into it and against my judgment  Soon after he let me know as I said in his own handwriting what an illiterate what a mere supersicial man I had entered into treaty with And ever since I have been endeavouring by pen as well as in person to get him to absolve me from my rash promise And this was my view and endeavour before I had a title to the independence in which Sir you was so good as to establish me  I once thought proceeded she that he would  easily have complied and have look'd out elsewhere for a wife for I sought not to  fetter  him as you justly call it He was not of so much consequence with me and this renders me perhaps the less excuseableBut you held me not long enough in suspense as to the great things you intended to do for me to enable me to obtain that release from Captain Anderson which I was meditating to procure before he knew what those were  All this time I kept my own secret I had not confidence enough in the steps I had so rashly taken indeed had not  humility  enough to make any living creature acquainted with my situation And this was the reason I suppose that I never was guessed at or found out The proverb says▪  Two can keep a secret when one is away  But my Harriet knows I bowed that I very early in my knowledge of her dropt hints of an  entanglement  as I ludicrously called it for I could not with justice say  Love  Sir Ch  Charming frankness How do your virtues shine thro' your very mistakesBut there are many women who have suffer'd themselves to be worse entangled even beyond recovery when they have not had to plead the apprehensions which you had at entering into this affair  Miss Gr  You are Sir  Charles Grandison  Sir I need no  say more We often dread in rash encounter  to make those communications which only can be means to  ricate us from the difficulties into which we have plunged ourselves Had I for the last six or seven years of my life known my brother as I now know him had I been indulged in a correspondence with him in his absence not a step would I have taken but with his approbation  Sir Ch  Perhaps I was too implicit on this occasion But I always thought it more safe in a disputable case to check than to give way to an inclination My father knew the world He was not an illnatured man  He loved his daughters I had not the vanity to imagine that my sisters the  youngest  near as old as myself would want my advice in material articles And to break thro' a father's commands for the sake merely of gratifying  myself  I don't know howBut I could  not  do it And as a considerate person when he has lost a dear friend and more particularly a parent is apt to recollect with pleasure those instances in which he has given joy to the departed and with pain the contrary methinks I am the more satisfied with myself for having obeyed a command that however at the time I knew not how to account for  Miss Gr  You are happy brother in this recollection I should be more unhappy than I am on your principles had I vexed my father in this affair Thank God he knew nothing of it But now Sir I have told you the whole truth I have not aggravated the failings of Captain Anderson nor wish to do so for the man that once I had but the shadow of a thought to make one day my nearest relation is intitled I think to my good  wishes  tho' he prove not quite so worthy as I once believed him  Permit me however to add that Captain Anderson is passionate overbearing I have never of late met him but with great reluctance Had I not come to Colnebrooke I should have  seen  him as I confessed but it was with the resolution that I had for a considerable time past avowed to him Never to be his and to be a single woman all my life if he would not disengage me of my rash my foolish promise And now be pleased looking round her to every one present to advise me what to do  Lord L  I think the man utterly unworthy of you sister Charlotte I think you are right to resolve never to have him  Lady L  Without waiting for my brother's opinion I must say That he acts most ungenerously and unworthily to hold you to an  unequal  promise A promise  the like of which you offered not to bind  him  by I cannot Charlotte think you bound by such a promise And the poor trick of getting another person to write his letters for him and exposing my sister to a stranger and against stipulationHow I should hate himWhat say you sister Harriet  Harriet  I should be unworthy of this kind confidence if thus called upon I did not say something tho' it came out to be next to nothingThere seems not to have been any strong affection any sympathy of soul if I may so express myself at  any  time Miss Grandison between you and Captain Anderson I think  Sir Ch  A very proper question  Miss Gr  There was not on  either  side I believe I have hinted at  my  motives and at  his  In every letter of his he gave me cause to confirm what I have said of his selfinterestedness And now his principal plea to hold me to my promise is  his  interest I would not to him I never did plead  mine  tho' his example would excuse me if I did  Lord L  Was the promise given in writing sister  Miss Gr  Indeed it was She looked down  Harriet  May I be pardon'd madamThe substance of your promise was That you would never marry any other man without his consent while he remained unmarriedDid you promise that if ever you did marry at all it should be to him  Miss Gr  No He wanted me to promise that but I refused And now my Harriet what is your advice  Harriet  I beg to hear Dr Bartlett's opinion and yours Sir to Sir Charles before I presume to give mine  Sir Charles looked at the Doctor The Doctor referred himself to him  Sir Ch  Then Doctor you must set me right if I am wrong You are a Casuist  As to what Lord L has said I think with his Lordship that Captain Anderson appears not in any of his conduct to be worthy of Miss Grandison And in truth I don't know many who are If I am partial excuse the  brother  She bowed Every one was pleased that Miss Grandison was enabled to hold up her head as she did on this compliment from her brother  Sir Ch  I think also if my sister esteems him not she is in the right to resolve never to be his But what shall we say as to her promise  Never  to be the wife of any other man without his consent▪ while he remains unmarried It was made I apprehend while her father was living who might I believe Doctor you will allow have absolved her from it But then her very treating with him since to dispense with it shews that in her own conscience she thinks herself bound by it  Every one being silent he proceeded  Lady L is of opinion that he acts ungenerously and unworthily to endeavour to hold her to an unequal promise But what man except a  very  generous one indeed having obtained an advantage over such a woman as Charlotte She redden'd would not try to hold it Must he not by giving up this advantage vote against himself Women should be sure of the men in whom they place a confidence that concerns them highly Can you think that the man who engages a woman to make a promise does not  intend  to hold her to it When he  teazes  her to make it he as good as tells her he  does  let what will happen to make her wish she had not  Miss Gr  O my brother The repetition of that word  teazes  Are you not raillying meIndeed I deserve it  Sir Ch  Men gain all their advantages by  teazing  by  promises  by  importunities  Be not concerned my Charlotte that I use your word  Miss Gr  O my brother what shall I do if you railly me on my folly  Sir Ch  I mean not to railly you But I know something of my own sex and must have been very negligent of my opportunities if I know not something of the  world  I thought Lucy he would here have used the word  other  instead of the word  world  We have heard her reason for not binding the Captain by a like promise which was That she did not value him enough to exact it And was not that his misfortune  She is apprehensive of blame on this head But her situation will be consider'd I  must not  repeat the circumstances I was grieved to hear that my sisters had been in  such  circumstances What pity that those who believe they  best  know the Sex think themselves intitled to treat it with least respect How we women looked upon one another I should hope in charity In charity Lucy and for the true value I bear it as I think a good woman one of the greatest glories of the creation that the fault is not  generally  in the Sex  As to the Captain's artifice to obtain a footing by letters of another man's writing that was enough indeed to make a woman who herself writes finely despise him when she knew it But to what will not persons stoop to gain a point on which their hearts are fixedThis is no  new  method One signal instance I will mention Madam Maintenon it is reported was employed in this way by a favourite mistress of Louis XIV And this was said to be the means of introducing her to the monarch's favour on the ruins of her employer Let me repeat that women should be  sure  of their men before they embark with them in the voyage of Love  Hate the man  says Lady L for  exposing her to the letter writerExposing  Let me say That women who would not be  exposed  should not put themselves out of their  own power O Miss Byron turning to my confusion to me who was too ready to apply the first part of the caution be so good as to tell my Emily that she never love a man of whose Love she is not well assured That she never permit a man to know his consequence with her 'till she is sure he is grateful just and generous And that she despise him as a mean and interested man the first moment he seeks to engage her in a  promise  Forgive me Charlotte You so generously blame yourself that youwill not scruple to have  your  experience pleaded for an example to a young creature who may not be able if entangled▪ to behave with your magnanimity  Seasonably did he say this last part so immediatley after his reference to me for I made Miss Grandison's confusion a halfcover for my own and I fear but a halfcover  I find I must not allow myself to be long from you my dear friends at least in this company Miss Cantillon Miss Barnevelt and half a dozen more Misses and Masters with whose characters and descriptions I first paraded Where are you Where can I find you My heart when I saw you at Lady Betty Williams's was easy and unapprehensive I could then throw my little squibs about me at pleasure and not fear by their return upon me the singeing of my own cloaths  LETTER XXX Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  BUT now what remains to be done for our sister ask'd Lady L Charlotte looked round her as seconding the question Every one referr'd to Sir Charles  In the first place let me assure you my dear Charlotte resumed he that if you have but the shadow of a  preference for Captain Anderson and if you believe from what has passed between you and from the suspense you have kept him in which may have been a hindrance to his fortune or preferment that you  ought  to be his whether in justice or by inclination I will amicably meet him in order to make and to receive proposals If we do not  find  him grateful or generous we will  make  him so by our example and I will begin to set it  Every one was affected Dr Bartlett as much as anybody Miss Grandison could hardly sit still Her chair was uneasy to her While her brother looked like one who was too much accustomed to acts of beneficence to suppose he had said anything extraordinary  Miss Grandison after some hesitation replied Indeed Sir Captain Anderson is  not  worthy of being called your brother I will not enter into the particulars of his unworthiness because I am determined not to have him He knows I am Nor does my promise engage me to be his Had he virtue had he generosityBut indeed he has not either in the degree that would make me respect him as a woman should respect her husband  Sir Ch  Well then Charlotte I would have you excuse yourself if you have given him hope of meeting him let him know that you have acquainted me with all that has passed between you and that you refer yourself wholly to me but with a resolution if such  be  your resolution never to be his  Miss Gr  I shall dread his violent temper  Sir Ch  Dread nothing Men who are violent to a woman when they have a point to carry by being so are not always violent to men But I shall treat him civilly If the man ever hoped to call you his he will be unhappy enough in losing such a prize You may tell him that I will give him a meeting whereever he pleases Mean time it may not be amiss if  you have no objection to shew me some of the letters that have passed between you of those particularly in which you have declared your resolution not to be his the farther backward the better if from the date of such you have  always  been of the same mind  Miss Gr  You shall see the copies of  all  my letters and  all  his if you please And you will gather from both Sir that it was owing to the unhappy situation I thought myself in from the unkind treatment my sister met with and to the being forbidden to expect a fortune that would intitle me to look up to a man of figure in the world that I was ever approachable by Captain Anderson  Sir Ch  Unhappy But let us look forward I will meet Captain Anderson If there are any letters in which he has treated my sister undhandsomely you must not let me see them My motive for looking into  any  of them is service to you Charlotte and not curiosity But let me nevertheless see all that is necessary to the question that I may not when I meet him hear anything from him that I have not heard from you and which may make for him and against you I do assure you that I will allow in his favour all that shall appear favourable to him tho' against my sister I may meet him  prejudiced  but not  determined  And I hope you see by my behaviour to you Charlotte that were you and he to have been fond Lovers in your letters you need not be afraid of my eye I never am severe on Lovers foibles Our passions may be made subservient to excellent purposes Don't think you have a supercilious brother A susceptibility of the passion called  Love  I condemn not as a fault but the contrary Your  brother  Ladies looking upon all three is no Stoic  And have you been in love Sir Charles Grandison thought I to myselfShall I Lucy be sorry or shall I be glad if he  has  But after all is it not strange that in all this time one knows so little of his history  while he was abroadAnd yet he said That he was not angry at his sister for questioning him on the subject Had I been his sister questions of that sort would not have been to be  now  asked  But here is a new task for her brother I shall long to know how this affair will end  The tryal of Miss Grandison as she called it being thus happily over and Miss Emily and Mr Grandison desired to walk in Sir Charles took notice with some severity on our sex on the general liking which he said women have for military men He did not know he said whether the army were not beholden to this approbation and to the gay appearance officers were expected to make rather than to a true martial spirit for many a gallant man  What say you Emily said he Do not a cockade and a scarlet coat become a  fine gentleman  and help to make him so in your eyes  Be pleased Sir to tell me how such a one should look in my eyes and I will endeavour to make them conform to your lessons  He bowed to the happy girl For my part said he I cannot but say that I dislike the life of a soldier in general whose trade is in blood who must be as much a slave to the will of  his  superiors in command as he is almost  obliged  to be a tyrant to those under him  But as to the Sex if it were not that Ladies where Love and their own happiness interfere are the most incompetent judges of all others for themselvesPardon me  Your servant Sir said Lady LAnd we all bowed to him  How can a woman proceeded he who really loves her husband subject herself of  choice  to the necessary absences to the continual apprehensions which she must be under for his safety when he is in the height of what is emphatically called his DUTY He stopt  No answer being made Perhaps resumed he i may be thus accounted for Women are the most delicate part of the creation Conscious of the weakness of their sex and that they stand in need of protection for apprehensiveness the child of prudence▪ is as characteristic in them as courage in a man they naturally love brave menAnd are not all military men supposed to be brave  But how are they mistaken in their main end supposing this to be it  I honour a good a generous a brave and humane soldier But were such an one to be the bravest of men how can his wife expect constant protection from the husband who is less his  own  and consequently less  hers  than almost any other man can be a  sailor  excepted and who must therefore oftener than any other man leave her exposed to those insults from which she seems to think he can best defend her  Lady L  smiling But may it not be said Sir that those women who make soldiers their choice deserve in some degree a rank with heroes when they can part with their husbands for the sake of their country's glory  Sir Ch  Change your word  glory  for  safety  Lady L and your question will be strengthen'd The word and thing called  Glory  what mischief has it not occasionedAs to the question itself were you  serious  let every one I answer who can plead the  motive  be intitled to the  praise  that is due to it  Miss Gr  There is so much weight in what my brother has said that I thank Heaven I am not in danger of being the wife of a soldier  We who knew what she alluded to smiled at it and Mr Grandison looked about him as if he wanted to find more in the words than they could import to him And then was very earnest to know how his cousin had come off  Sir Ch  Triumphantly cousin Charlotte's supposed fault h  s brought to light additional excellencies  Mr Gr  I am sorry for that with all my soulThere was no bearing her beforeAnd now what will become of me  Miss Gr  You have nothing new to fear Mr Grandison I assure you I have been detected in real faults I have been generously treated and repent of my fault Let me have an instance of like ingenuousness in you and I will say there are hopes of us both  Mr Gr  Your servant cousin  Either  way I must have it But were you to follow the example by which you own yourself amended I might have the better chance perhaps of coming up to you in ingenuousness  Lord L  Upon my word sister Charlotte Mr Grandison has said a good thing  Miss Gr  I think so too my Lord I will put it down And if you are wise Sir to him ask me to sew up your lips 'till tomorrow dinnertime  Mr Grandison looked offended  Sir Ch  Fie Charlotte  I am glad thought I my good Miss Grandison that you have not lost much spirit by your tryal  MISS Grandison has shewed me some of the letters that passed between Captain Anderson and her How must she have despised him had she been drawn in to give him her hand And the more for the poor figure he would have made as a brother to  her  brother How must she have blushed at every civility paid him in such a family Yet from passages in his letters I dare say he would have had the higher opinion of himself first for his success with her and for every civility paid him afterwards by her relations  And thus had Sir Thomas Grandison with all his pride like to have thrown his daughter a woman of  high character fine understanding and an exalted mind into the arms of a man who had neither fortune nor education nor yet good sense nor generosity of heart to countenance his pretensions to such a Lady or her for marrying beneath herself  This is a copy of what Miss Grandison has written to send to Captain Anderson  Sir  HAD I had a generous man to deal with I needed not to have exposed myself to the apprehended censures of a brother whose virtues made a sister less perfect than himself afraid that he would think her unworthy of that tender relation to him from the occasion But he is the noblest of brothers He pities me and undertakes to talk with you in the most friendly manner at your own appointment upon a subject that has long greatly distressed me as  well  you know I will not recriminate as I might But this assurance I must for the hundredth time repeat That I never can never will be to you any other than  CHARLOTTE GRANDISON  She is dissatisfied with what she has written But I tell her I think it will do very well  LETTER XXXI Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Thursday Mar  SIR Charles has already left us He went to town this morning on the affairs of his executorship He breakfasted with us first  Dr Bartlett with whom already I have made myself very intimate and who I find knows his whole heart tells me he is always fully employed  That  we knew beforeNo wonder then that he is not in love He  has not had leisure I suppose to attend to the calls of such an idle passion  You will do me the justice to own that in the round of employments I was engaged in at Selbyhouse I never knew anything of the matter But indeed there was no Sir Charles Grandison first to engage my gratitude and then my heart So it is I must not it seems  deny  it If I did  "a child in Lovematters would detect me"  O MY Lucy I have been hard set by these sisters They have found me out or rather let me know that they long ago found me out I will tell you all as it passed  I had been so busy with my pen that tho' accustomed to be first dressed wherever I was I was now the last They entered my dressingroom arm in arm and I have since recollected that they looked as if they had mischief in their hearts Miss Grandison especially She had said She would play me a trick  I was in some little hurry to be so much behindhand when I saw them dressed  Miss Grandison would do me the honour of assisting me and dismissed Jenny who had but just come in to offer her service  She called me charming creature twice as she was obligingly busy about me and the second time said Well may my brother Lady L say what he did of this girl  With too great eagerness What what said II was going to add  did he say  But catching myself up in a tone of less surprizedesigning to turn it offWHAT  honour you do me madam in this your kind assistance  Miss Grandison leered archly at me then turning to Lady L This Harriet of ours said she is more than half a rogue  Punish her then Charlotte said Lady L You have tho' with much ado been brought to speak out yourself and so have acquired a kind of right to punish those who affect disguises to their best friends  Lord bless me Ladies And down I satWhat whatI was going to say  do you mean  But stopt and I felt my face glow  What what  repeated Miss GrandisonMy sweet girl can say nothing but  What what  One of my fellows Sir Walter Watkyns is in her head I supposeDid you ever see  Wat  Watkyns Harriett  My handkerchief was in my hand as I was going to put it on I was unable to throw it round my neck O how the fool throbbed and trembled  Miss Gr  Confirmation Lady L Confirmation  Lady L  I think so trulyBut it wanted none to me  Har  I am surprised Pray Ladies what can you mean by this sudden attack  Miss Gr  And what Harriet can you mean by these  What what  's and this sudden emotionGive me your handkerchiefWhat doings are here  She snatch'd it out of my trembling hand and put it round my neckWhy this  sudden  palpitationAh Harriet Why won't you make confidents of your two sisters Do you think we have not found you out before this  Har  Found me out How found me outDear Miss Grandison you are the most alarming Lady that ever lived  I stood up trembling  Miss Gr  Am I so But to cut the matter shortSit down Harriet You can hardly stand Is it such a disgraceful thing for a fine girl to be in Love  Har  Who I I in Love  Miss Gr  laughing So Lady L you see that Harriet has found herself out to be a  fine  girl  Disqualify now can't you my dear Tell fibs▪ Be affected Say you are  not  a sine girl andsoforth  Har  Dear Miss GrandisonIt was  your  turn the day before yesterday How can you forget  Miss Gr  Spiteful too My life to a farthing you pay for  this  HarrietBut child I was not in LoveAh Harriet That gentleman in NorthhamptonshireDid you think we should not find you out  This hearten'd me a little  Har  O Madam do you think to come at anything by such methods as this I ought to have been aware of Miss Grandison's alarming ways  Miss Gr  You pay for  this  also Harriet Did you not say that I should take the reins Lady L I will have no mercy on our younger sister for this abominable affectation and reserve  Har  And so Ladies you think I warrant that Mr Orme  Lord L  Take the reins Charlotte making a motion with a sweet pretty air with her handkerchief as if she tossed her somethingI myself Harriet am against you now I wanted a trial of that frankness of heart for which I have heard you so much commended And surely you might have shewed it if to any persons living to your two sisters  Miss Gr  No more▪ no more Lady L Have you not left her to me I will punish her  You  will have too much lenityAnd now tell me HarrietDon't you love Mr Orme better than any Man you ever yet saw  Har  Indeed I do not  Miss Gr  Whom do you love better Harriet  Har  Pray Miss Grandison  Miss Gr  And  pray  Miss Byron▪  Har  Resume the reins Lady LPray do  Miss Grandison has no mercy Yet met with a great deal the day before yester  Miss Gr  The day before yesterdayVery wellBut then I was ingenuous  Har  And am not IPray Lady L  Lady L  I think not  And she seemed a little too cruelly to enjoy the flutter I was in  Miss Gr  And you say that there is no one gentleman in Northamptonshire  Har  What is the meaning of this Ladies But I do assure you there is not  Miss Gr  See Lady L there are some questions that the girl can answer readily enough  I believe I looked serious I was silent Indeed my very soul was vexed  Miss Gr  Ay Harriet be sullen Don't answer any questions at all That's your only way nowAnd then we go no further you know But tell meDon't you repent that you have given a denial to Lady D  Har  I won't be sullen Ladies Yet I am not pleased to be thus  Miss Gr  Then own yourself a woman Harriet and that in some certain instances you have both affectation and reserve There are some cases my dear in which it is impossible but a woman must be guilty of affectation  Har  Well then suppose I  am  I never pretended to be clear of the foibles which you impute to the Sex I am a weak a very weak creature You see I am  And I put my hand in my pocket for my handkerchief  Miss Gr  Ay weep love My sister has heard me say that I never in my life saw a girl so lovely in tears  Har  What have I done to deserve  Miss Gr  Such a complimentHayBut you sha'n't weep neitherWhy why is this subject so  ffecting Harriet  Har  You surprise meParted with you but an hour or two agoAnd nothing of these reproaches And now all at once  both  Ladies  Miss Gr  Reproaches Harriet  Har  I believe so I don't know what else to call them  Miss Gr  What Is it a reproach to be taxed with Love  Har  But the manner madam  Miss Gr  The  manner  you are taxed with it is the thing thenWell putting on a grave look and assuming a softer accentYou  are  in Love however But with whom is the questionAre we your sisters intitled to know with whom  Surely Ladies thought I you have something to say that will make me amends for all this intolerable teazing And yet my proud heart whatever it were to be swelled a little that  they  should think  that  would be such high amends which however I by myself communing only with my own heart would have thought so  Lady L  coming to me and taking my hand Let me tell you our dearest Harriet that you are the most insensible girl in the world if you are  not  in LoveAnd  now  what say you  Har  Perhaps I do know Ladies enough of the Passion to wish to be less alarmingly treated  They then sitting down one on either side of me each took a hand of the trembling fool  I think I  will  resume the reins Charlotte said the Countess We are both cruel But tell us my lovely sister in one word tell your Caroline tell your Charlotte if you have any confidence in our love and indeed we love you or we would not have teazed you as we have done if there be not one man in the world whom you love above all men in it  I was silent I looked down I had in the same moment an ague in its cold and in its hot fit They  vouchsafed each to press with her lips the passive hand each held  Be not afraid to speak out my dear said Miss Grandison Assure yourself of my love my true  sisterly  love I once intended to lay the way to the opening of your heart by the discovery of my own before my brother as I hoped could have found me outBut nothing can be hid  Madam Ladies said I and stood up in a hurry and in as great a discomposure sat down againYour brother has not could notI would die before  Miss Gr  Amiable delicacyHe has notBut say you Harriet he  could  notIf you would not be teazed don't aim at reservesBut think you that we could not see on an hundred occasions your heart at your eyesThat we could not affix a proper meaning to those sudden throbs just here patting my neck those halfsuppressed but always involuntary sighsI sighedAy just such as thatI was confoundedBut to be serious we do assure you Harriet that had we not thought ourselves under some little obligation to Lady Anne S we should have talked to you before on this subject The friends of that Lady have heen very solicitous with usAnd Lady Anne is not averse  Har  Dear Ladies withdrawing the hand that Miss Grandison held and taking out my handkerchief you say you love meWon't you despise whom you loveI do own  There I stopt and dried my eyes  Lady L  What does my Harriet own  Har  O madam had I a greater opinion of my own merit than I have reason to have and I never had so little an one as since I have known you two I could open to you without reserve my whole heartBut one request I have to make youYou must grant it  They both in a breath asked what that was  Har  It is That you will permit your chariot to carry me to town this very afternoonAnd long shall not that  town  hold your HarrietIndeed indeed Ladies I cannot now ever look your brother in the faceAnd you will also both despise me I know you will  Sweet and as  seasonable  as sweet for I was very much affected were the assurances they gave m of their continued love  Miss Gr  We have talked with our brother this morning  Har  About me I hope he has not a notion thatThere I stopt  Lady L  You were mentioned But we intend not to alarm you farther We will tell you what passed Lady Anne was our subject  I was all attention  Miss Gr  We asked him if he had any thoughts of marriage The question came in properly enough from the subject that preceded it He was silent But sighed and looked grave Why did Sir Charles Grandison sigh Lucy We repeated the question You told us brother said I that you do not intend to resume the treaty begun by my father for Lady Frances N What think you of Lady Anne S We need not mention to you how considerable her fortune is what an enlargement it would give to your power of doing good nor what her disposition and qualities are Her person is far from being disagreeable And she has a great esteem for you  I think Lady Anne a very agreeable woman replied he But if she honours me with a preferable esteem she gives me regret because it is not in my power to return it  Not in your  power  brother  It is not in my power to return it  O Lucy how my heart slutter'd The aguesir  came on again and I was hot and cold as before almost in the same Moment  They told me they would not teaze me further But there are subjects that cannot be touch'd upon without raising emotion in the bosom of a person who hopes and is uncertain O the cruelty of suspense How every new instance of it tears in pieces my before almost bursting heart  Miss Gr  My brother went onYou have often hinted to me at a distance this subject I will not as I might answer your question now so  directly  put by saying that it is my wish to see you Charlotte happily married before I engage myself But perhaps I shall be better enabled some time hence than I am at present to return such an answer as you may expect from a brother  Now my Harriet we are afraid by the words  Not in his power  and by the hint that he cannot at present answer our question as he may be enabled to do some time hence we are afraid that some foreign Lady  They had raised my hopes and now exciting my fears by so wellgrounded an apprehension they were obliged for their pains to hold Lady L's salts to my nose I could not help exposing myself my heart having been weaken'd too by their teazings before My head dropt on the shoulder of Miss Grandison Tears relieved me  I desired their pity They assured me of their love and called upon me as I valued their friendship to open my whole heart to them  I paused I hesitated For words did not immediately offer themselves But at last I said Could I have thought myself intitled to your▪ excuse Ladies your Harriet honoured as she was from the first with the appellation of  sister  would have had no reserve to  her  sisters But a just consciousness of my wn unworthiness overcame a temper that I will  say is naturally frank and unreserved Now however  There I stopt and held down my head  Lady L  Speak out my dearWhat  Now    Miss Gr What  Now however  Harriet  Thus called upon thus encouragedAnd I lifted up my head as boldly as I could but it was not I believe very boldly I will own that the man who by so signal an instance of his bravery and goodness engaged my gratitude has possession of my whole heart  And then almost unknowing what I did I threw one of my arms as I sat between them round Lady L's neck the other round Miss Grandison's my glowing face seeking to hide itself in Lady L's bosom  They both embraced me and assured me of their united interest They said They knew I had also Dr Bartlett's high regard But that they had in vain sought to procure new lights from him he constantly in everything that related to their brother referring himself to him And they assured me that I had likewise the best wishes and Interest of Lord L to the fullest extent  This Lucy is someconsolationmust I saysome ease to my pride as to what the  family  think of me But yet how is that pride mortified to be thus obliged to rejoice at this strengthening of hope to obtain an interest in the heart of a man of whose engagements none of us know anything But if at last it shall prove that that worthiest of hearts is disengaged and if I  can  obtain an interest in it be pride out of the question The man as my aunt wrote is Sir Charles Grandison  I was very earnest to know since my eyes had been such telltales if their brother had any suspicion of my regard for him  They could not they said either from his words or behaviour gather that he had He had not been so  much with me as they had been Nor would they wish that he  should  suspect me The best of men they said loved to have difficulties to conquer Their brother generous as he was was a  man  Yet Lucy I thought at the time of what he said at Sir Hargrave Pollexfen's as recited by the shorthand writerThat he would not marry the greatest princess on earth if he were not assured that she loved him above all the men in it  I fancy my dear that we women when we love and are doubtful suffer a great deal in the apprehension at one time of disgusting the object of our passion by too forward a Love and at another of disobliging him by too great a reserve Don't you think so  The Ladies said They were extremely solicitous to see their brother married They wished it were to me rather than to any other woman and kindly added That I had their hearts even at the time when Lady Anne by a kind of previous engagement had their voices  And then they told me what their brother said of me with the hint of which they began this alarming conversation  When my brother had let us know said Miss Grandison that it was not in his power to return a preferable esteem for a like esteem if Lady Anne honoured him with it I saidHad Lady Anne as many advantages to boast of as Miss Byron has could you then brother like Lady Anne  Miss Byron replied he is a charming woman  Lady L slily enough continued Miss Grandison said Miss Byron is one of the prettiest women I ever beheld I never saw in any face youth and dignity and sweetness of aspect so happily blended  On this occasion Lucy my vanity may I hope revive so long as I  repeat  only and repeat justly  "Forgive me Lady L replied my brotherBut  as Alexander would be drawn only by Apelles so would I say to all those who leave  mind  out of the description of Miss Byron That  they  are not to "describe her This young Lady" You  may  look proud Harriet "has  united  in her face  feature complexion grace  and  expression  which very few women even of those who are most celebrated for beauty have  singly  in equal degree But what is infinitely more valuable she has an heart that is equally pure and open She has a fine mind And it is legible in her face Have you not observed Charlotte added he what intelligence her very silence promises And yet when she speaks she never disappoints the most raised expectations"  I was speechless Lucy  Well brother continued Miss GrandisonIf there is not everything you say in Miss Byron's face and mind there seems to me little less than the warmth of Love in the descriptionYou are another Apelles Sir if his colours were the most glowing of those of all painters  My eyes had the assurance to ask Miss Grandison What answer he returned to this She saw they had  Ah Harriet smillingThat's a meaning look with all its bashfulness This was my brother's answer  "Everybody must love Miss ByronYou know Charlotte that I presented her to  you  and you to  her  as a third sister And what man better loves his sisters than your brother"  We both looked down Harriet but not quite so silly and so dissappointed a you  now  look  Dear Miss Grandison  Well then another time don't let your eyes ask questions instead of your lips  Third sister  my Lucy Indeed I believe I looked silly enough To say the truth I  was  dissappointed  Har  And this was all that passed You hear by my question Ladies that my lips  will  keep my eyes in countenance  Miss Gr  It was for he retired as soon as he had said this  Har How  retired madamAny  discompo  You laugh at my folly at my presumption perhaps  They both smiled No I can't say that there seemed to be either in his word or manner any  distinguishing  emotion any great  discompo  He was about to retire before  Well Ladies I will only say That the best thing I can do is to borrow a chariotandsix and drive away to Northamptonshire  But wh yo Harriet  Because it is impossible but I must suffer in your brother's opinion every time he sees me and that whether I am silent or speaking  They made me fine compliments But they would  indeed  have been fine ones could they have made them from their brother  Well but Lucy don't you think that had Sir Charles Grandison meant anything he would have expressed himself to his sisters in such high terms before he had said  one  very distinguishing thing to me Let me judge by myselfMen and women I believe are so much alike that put custom tyrantcustom out of the question the meaning of the one may be generally guessed at by that of the other in cases where the heart is concerned What civil what polite things could I allow myself to say to and of Mr Orme and Mr Fowler How could I praise the honesty and goodness of their hearts and declare my pity for them And why Because I meant nothing more by it all than a warmer kind of civility that I was not  afraid  to  let go  as their merits  pulled  And now methinks I can better guess than I could  till  now at what Mr Greville meant when he wished me to declare that I  hated  him Sly wretchsince the woman who uses a man insolently in courtship certainly makes that man of more importance to her than she would wish him to think himself  But why am I studious to torment myself What  will  be  must  "Who knows what Providence has designed for Sir Charles Grandison"  May  he  be happy But indeed my Lucy your Harriet is much otherwise at this time  LETTER XXXI Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Wednesday March  I WILL not let you lose the substance of a very agreeable conversation which we had last night after supper You may be sure I thought it the more agreeable as Sir Charles was drawn in to bear a considerable part in it It would be impossible to give you more than passages because the subjects were various and the transitions so quick by one person asking this question another that that I could not were I to try connect them as I endeavour generally to do  Of one subject Lucy I particularly  owe  you some account Miss Grandison in her lively way and lively she was notwithstanding her trial so lately over led me into talking of the detested masquerade She put me upon recollecting the giddy scene which those dreadfully interesting ones that followed it had made me wish to blot out of my memory  I spared you at the time Harriet said she I asked you no questions about the masquerade when you flew to us first poor frighted bird with all your gay plumage about you  I coloured a deep crimson I believe What were Sir Charles's first thoughts of me Lucy in that fantastic that hated dress The simile of the bird too was  his  you know and Charlotte looked very archly  My dear Miss Grandison spare me still Let me  forget that ever I presumptuously ventured into such a scene of folly  Do not call it by harsh names Miss Byron said Sir Charles We are too much obliged to it  Can I Sir Charles call it by  too  harsh a name when I think how fatal in numberless ways the event might have proved But I do not speak only with reference to that Don't think my dear Miss Grandison that my dislike to myself and to this foolish diversion springs altogether from what befel  me  The same shocking villainy might have been attempted by the same vile man from a more laudable and reasonable diversion I had on the spot the same contempts the same disdain of myself the dislike of all those who seemed capable of joy on the light the foolish occasion  My good Charlotte said Sir Charles smiling is less timorous than her younger sister  She  might be persuaded I fancy to venture  Under your conduct Sir Charles You know Lady L and I who have not yet had an opportunity of this sort were trying to engage you against the next subscriptionball  Indeed said Lady L our Harriet's distress has led me into reflexions I never made before on this kind of diversion and I fancy her account of it will perfectly satisfy  my  curiosity  Sir Ch  Proceed good Miss Byron I am as curious as your sisters to hear what you say of it The scene was quite new to you You probably expected entertainment from it Forget for a while the accidental consequences and tell us how you were at the time amused  Amused Sir CharlesIndeed I had no opinion of the diversion even before I went I knew I should despise it I knew I should often wish myself at home before the evening were over And so indeed I did I whispered my cousin Reeves more than once O madam  this is sad This is intolerable stuff This place is one great bedlam Good Heaven▪ Could there be in this one town so many creatures devoid of reason as are here got together I hope we are  all  here  Yet you see said Miss Grandison however Lady L is or seems to be instantaneously informed there were  two  who would gladly have been there The more you may be sure for its having been a diversion prohibited to us at our first coming to town Sir Charles lived long in the land of masqueradesOh my dear we used to please ourselves with hopes that when he was permitted to come over to England we should see golden days under his auspices  Sir Ch  smiling Will you accompany us to the next subscriptionball Miss Byron  I Sir Charles should be inexcusable if I thought  Miss Gr  interrupting and looking archly Not under  our brother's  conduct Harriet  Indeed my dear Miss Grandison had the diversion not been  prohibited  had you once seen the wild the senseless confusion you would think just as I do And you would have one stronger reason against countenancing it by your presence for who at this rate shall make the stand of virtue and decorum if such Ladies as Miss Grandison and Lady L do notBut I speak of the common masquerades which I believe are more disorderly I was disgusted at the freedoms taken with me tho' but the common freedoms of the place by persons who singled me from the throng hurried me round the rooms and engaged me in fifty idle conversations and to whom by the privilege of the place I was obliged to be bold pert saucy and to aim at repartee and smartness the current wit of that witless place They once got me into a countrydance No prude could come or if she came could be a prude there  Sir Ch  Were you not pleased Miss Byron with the first coup d'oeil of that gay apartment  A momentary pleasure but when I came to reflect the bright light striking on my tinsel dress made me seem to myself the more conspicuous fool Let me be kept in countenance as I might by scores of still more ridiculous figures what thought I are other people's follies to me Am I to make an appearance that shall want the countenance of the vainest if not the silliest part of the  creation  What would my good grandfather have thought could he have seen his Harriet the girl whose mind he took pains to form and enlarge mingling in a habit so preposterously rich and gaudy with a croud of Satyrs Harlequins Scaramouches Fauns and Dryads nay of Witches and Devils the graver habits striving which should most disgrace the characters they assumed and every one endeavouring to be thought the direct contrary of what they appeared to be  Miss Gr  Well then the Devils at least must have been charming creatures  Lady L  But Sir Charles might not a masquerade if decorum were observed and every one would support with wit and spirit the assumed character  Mr Gr  Devils and all Lady L  Lady L  It is contrary to decorum for such shocking characters to be assumed at all But might it not Sir Charles so regulated be a rational and an almost instructive entertainment  Sir Ch  You would scarcely be able my dear sister to collect eight or nine hundred people all wits and all observant of decorum And if you could does not the example reach down to those who are capable of taking only the bad and dangerous part of a diversion which you may see by every common newspaper is become dreadfully general  Mr Gr  Well Sir Charles and why should not the poor devils in  low life  divert themselves as well as their betters For my part I rejoice when I see advertised  an eighteenpenny masquerade for all the pretty 'prentice souls who will that evening be Arcadian Shepherdesses Goddesses and Queens  I blushed at the word  Arcadian  yet Mr Grandison did not seem to have my masquerade dress in his thoughts  Miss Gr  What low profligate scenes couldst thou expatiate upon good man if thou wert in proper company I warrant those Goddesses have not wanted an adorer in our cousin Everard  Mr Gr  Dear Miss Charlotte take care I protest you begin to talk with the spite of an old maid  Miss Gr  There brother Do you hear the wretch Will not you knighterrand like defend the cause of a whole class of distressed damsels with our good Yorkshire aunt at the head of them  Sir Ch  Those general prejudices and aspersions Charlotte are indeed unjust and cruel Yet I am for having everybody marry Bachelors cousin Everard and maids when long single are looked upon as houses long empty which nobody cares to take As the houses in time by long disuse will be thought by the vulgar haunted by evil spirits so will the other by the  many  be thought possessed by no good ones  The transition was somehow made from hence to the equitableness that ought to be in our judgements of one another We must in these cases said Sir Charles throw merit in one scale demerit in the other and if the former weigh down the latter we must in charity pronounce to the person's advantage So it is humbly hoped we shall finally be judged ourselves For who is faultless  Yet said he for my own part that I may not be wanting to prudence I have sometimes where the merit is not very striking allowed persons at first acquaintance a short lease only in my good opinion some for three some for six some for nine others for twelve months renewable or not as they answer  expectation And by this meane I leave it to every one to make his own character with me I preserve my charity and my complacency and enter directly with frankness into conversation with him and generally continue that freedom to the end of the respective person's lease  Miss Gr  I wonder how many of your leases brother have been granted to Ladies  Sir Ch  Many Charlotte of the friendly sort But the kind you archly mean are out of the question at present We were talking of esteem  They insensibly led the conversation to Love and Courtship and he said What do you think he said Lucy That he should not perhaps were he in Love be overforward to declare his passion by words but rather shew it by his assiduities and veneration unless he saw that the suspense was painful to the object and in this case it would be equally mean and insolent not to break silence and put himself in the power of her whose honour and delicacy ought to be dearer to him than his own  What say you to this Lucy  Some think proceeded he that the days of courtship are the happiest days of life But the man who as a Lover thinks so is not to be forgiven Yet it must be confessed that  hope  gives an ardour which subsides in certainty  Being called upon by Lord L to be more explicit  I am not endeavouring said he to set up my particular humour for a general rule For my own sake I would not by a too early declaration drive a Lady into reserves since that would be to rob myself of those innocent freedoms and of that complacency to which an honourable Lover might think himself entitled and which might help him Don't be affrighted Ladies to develop the plaits and folds of the female heart  This developement stuck with us women a little We talked of it afterwards And Miss Grandison then said It was well her cousin Everard said not that And  he  answered Sir Charles may with more safety  steal an horse  than I  look over the hedge  Miss Gr  Ay cousin Grandison that is because you are a Rake A name believe me of at least as much reproach as that of an Old Maid  Mr Gr  Aspersing a whole class at once Miss Charlotte 'Tis contrary to your own maxim And a class too this of the Rakes that many a generousspirited girl chooses out of when she would dispose of herself and her fortune  Miss Gr  How malapert this Everard  What Sir Charles  next  said made him own the character more decently by his blushes  The woman who chooses a Rake said he does not consider that all the sprightly airs for which she preferred him to a better man either vanish in matrimony or are shewn to others to her mortal disquiet The agreeable will be carried abroad The disagreeable will be brought home If he reform and yet bad habits are very difficult to shake off he will probably from the reflexions on his past guilty life be an unsociable companion should deep and true contrition have laid hold on him If not what has she chosen He married not from honest principles A Rake despises matrimony If still a Rake what hold will she have of him A Rake in  Passion  is not a Rake in  Love  Such a one can seldom be in Love From a laudable passion he cannot He has no delicacy His Love deserves a vile name And if so it will be strange if in his eyes a common woman excel not his modest wife  What he said was openly approved by the Gentlemen tacitly by the Ladies  The subject changing to marriages of persons of unequal years I knew said Lord L a woman of character  and not reckoned to  who married at twenty a man of more than fif  y in hopes of burying him but who lived with her  eward of twenty years and then dying she is now in treaty with a young Rake of twentytwo She is rich and poor woman hopes to be happy Pity Sir Charles she could not see the picture you have been dra  ng  Retribution said Sir Charles will frequently take its course The Lady keeping in view one steady purpose which was That she would marry a young man whenever death removed the old one forgot when she lost her husband that she had been growing older for the last twenty years and will now very probably be the despised mate to the young husband that her late husband was to her Thirty years hence the now young man will perhaps fall into the error of his predecessor if he outlive the wife he is going to take and be punished in the same way These are what may be called punishments in kind The violators of the social duties are frequently punished by the success of their own wishes Don't you think my Lord that it is suitable to the divine benignity as well as justice to lend its sanctions and punishments in aid of those duties which bind man to man  Lord L said some very good things Your Harriet was not a mute But you know that my point is to let you into the character and sentiments of Sir Charles Grandison And whenever I can do them tolerable justice I shall keep to that point You will promise for me you say LucyI know you will  But one might have expected that Dr Bartlett would have said more than he did on some of the subjects Yet Mr Grandison and he and Miss Emily were almost equally and attentively silent till the last scene And then the Doctor said I must shew you a little translation of Miss Emily's from the Italian She blushed and looked as if she knew not whether she should stay or go I shall be glad to see  anything of my Emily's said Sir Charles I know she is a mistress of that language and elegant in her own Pray my dear to her let us be obliged if it will not pain you  She blushed and bowed  I must first tell you said the Doctor that I was the occasion of her choosing so grave a subject as you will find that of the sonnet from which hers is taken  A sonnet said Miss Grandison My dear little POETESS you must set it and sing it to us  No indeed madam said Miss Jervois blushing still more Dr Bartlett would by no means have me a  Poetess  I am sure And did you not dear madam speak that word as if you meant to call me a name  I think she did my dear said Sir Charles Nor would I have had my Emily distinguished by any name but that of a discreet an ingenious and an amiable young woman The title of  Wit  and  Poetess  has been disgraced too often by Sappho's and Corrinna's ancient and modern Was not this in your head sister But do not be disturbed my Emily the poor girl's eyes glistened I mean no check to liveliness and modest ingenuity The easy productions of a fine fancy not made the business of life or its boast confer no denomination that is disgraceful but very much the contrary  I am very glad for all  that  said Miss Jervois that my little translation is in plain prose Had it not I should have been very much afraid to have it seen  Even in that case you need not to have been afraid my dear Miss Jervois said the good Dr Bartlett Sir Charles is an admirer of good poetry And Miss Grandison would have recollected the Philomelas the Orinadas and other excellent names among her own sex whose fine genius does it honour  Your diffidence and sweet humility my dear Emily said Lady L would in you make the most envied accomplishments amiable  I am sure said the lovely girl hanging down her head tears ready to start I have reason to be affected with the subjectThe indulgent mother is described with so much sweet tendernessO what pleasures do mothers lose who want tenderness  We all either by eyes or voices called for the Sonnet and her translation Dr Bartlett shewed them to us and I sent copies of both  SONNET  of  Nicanvo da Filicaja  Qua madreì figlli con pietoso affetto  Mira e d'amor si strugge a lor davante  E un bacia in fronte ed un si stringe al petto  Uno tien su i ginnocchi un sulle piante  E mentre agli atti a i gemiti all' aspetto  Lor voglie intende si diverse e tante  A questi un guardo a quei dispensa un detto  E se ride o s'adira è sempre amante  Tal per noi Provvidenza alta infinita  Veglia e questi conforta e quei provvede  E tutti ascolta e porge a tutti aita  E se niega talor grazia a mercede  O niega fol perchè a pregar ne invita  O negar singe e nel negar concede  "See a fond mother incircled by her children With pious tenderness she looks around and her soul even melts with maternal Love One she kisses on the forehead and clasps another to her bosom One she sets upon her knees and finds a seat upon her foot for another And while by their actions their lisping words and asking eyes she understands their various numberless little wishes to these she dispenses a look a word to those and whether she smiles or frowns 'tis all in tender Love  "Such to us tho' infinitely high and awful is PROVIDENCE So it watches over us comforting these providing for those listening to all assisting  every one And if sometimes it denies the favour we implore it denies but to invite our more earnest prayers or seeming to deny a blessing grants one in that refusal"  When the translation was read aloud the tears that before were starting trickled down the sweet girl's cheeks But the commendations every one joined in and especially the praises given her by her guardian drove away every cloud from her face  LETTER XXXII Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss  GRANDISON  Friday March  My dear Charlotte  I HAVE already seen Captain Anderson Richard Saunder whom I sent with your Letter▪ as soon as I came to town found him at his lodgings near Whitehall He expressed himself on re  ding it before the servant with  indiferent  warmth I would not make minute enquiries after his words because I intended an amicable meeting with him  We met at four yesterday afternoon at the Cocoatree in Pallmall Lieut Col Mackenzie and Major Dillon two of his frienda with whom I had no acquaintance were with him Ths Captain and I withdrew to a private room The two gentlemen enter'd it with us  You will on this occasion I know expect me to be particular Yet must allow that I had no good cause to manage since those points that had most weight and which were the ground of your objections to him when you saw him in a near light could not be pleaded without affronting him and if they were would hardly meet with his allowance and could therefore have no force in the argument  On the two gentlemen entering the room with us without apology or objection I ask'd the Captain If they were acquainted with the affair we met upon He said They were his dear and inseparable friends and knew every secret of his heart Perhaps in this case Captain Anderson returned I it were as well they did not  We are men of honour Sir Charles Grandison said the Major briskly  I don't doubt it Sir But where the delicacy of a Lady is concern'd the hearts of the principals should be the whole world to each other But what is done is done I am ready to enter upon the affair before these gentlemen if you choose it Captain  You will find us to be gentlemen Sir Charles said the Colonel  The Captain then began with warmth his own story Indeed he told it very well I was pleased for my  sister's sake  pardon me Charlotte that he did He is not contemptible either in person or understanding He may be said perhaps to be an illiterate but he is not an ignorant man tho' not the person whom the friends of Charlotte Grandison would think worthy of the first place in her heart  After he had told his story which I need not repeat to you he insisted upon your promise And his two friends declared in his favour with airs each man a little too peremptory I told them so and that they must do me the justice to consider me as a man of some spirit as well as themselves I came hither with a friendly intention gentlemen said I I do not love to follow the lead of hasty spirits But if you expect to carry any point with me it must not be either by raised voices or heightened complexions  Their features were all at once changed And they said they meant not to be warm  I told the Captain That I would not enter into a minute defence of the Lady tho' my sister I owned  that there had appeared a precipitation in her conduct Her treatment at home as she aprehended was not answerable to her merits She was young and knew nothing of the world Young Ladies were often struck by appearances You Captain Anderson said I have advantages in person and manner that might obtain for you a young Lady's attention And as she believed herself circumstanced in her family I wonder not that she lent an air to the address of a gallant man whose command in that neighbourhood and I doubt not whose behaviour in that command added to his consequence But I take it for granted Sir that you met with difficulties from her when she came to reflect upon the disreputation of a young woman's carrying on clandestinely a correspondence with a man of whose address her father then living was not likely to approve There was none of that violent passion on either side that precludes reason discretion duty It is no wonder then that a woman of Charlotte Grandison's known good sense should reflect should consider And perhaps the less that you should therefore seek to engage her by promise But what  was  the promise It was not the promise that it seems you sought to engage her to make To be absolutely yours and no other man's But it was That she would not marry any other man without your consent while you remained single An unreasonable promise however I will presume to say either to be proposed or submitted to  Sir  said the Captain and looked the Soldier  I repeated what I last said  Sir  again said the Captain and looked upon his friends who pointed each his head at the other and at him by turnsas if they had said Very free language  For Sir proceeded I did it not give room to think that you had either some doubts of your own merit with the Lady or of her affection and steadiness  And in either case ought it to have been proposed ought it to have been made For my part I should disdain to think of any woman for a wife who gave me reason to imagine that she was likely to balance a moment as to her choice of me or any other man  Something in that said the Colonel  As you explain yourself Sir Charles said the Major  The Captain however sat swelling He was not so easily satisfied  Your motive we are not to question Captain was Love Miss Grandison is a young woman whom any man may love By the way where a man is assured of a return in Love there is no occasion for a promise But a promise  was  made My sister is a woman of honour She thinks herself bound by it and she is content to lead a single life to the end of it if you will not acquit her of this promise Yet she leaves and at the  time  did leave  you  free You will have the justice Sir to allow that there is generosity in her conduct to you which remains for you to shew to her since a promise should not be made but on equal terms Would you hold her to it and be not held yourself She desires not to hold you Let me tell you Captain that if I had been in your situation and had been able to  prevail upon myself  to endeavour to bring a Lady to make me such a promise I should have doubted her love of me had she not sought to bind me to her by an equal tie What should I have said to myself Is this Lady dearer to  me  than all the women upon earth Do I seek to bind her to me by a solemn promise which shall give me a power over  her  And has she so little regard for me as not to value whether I marry any other woman  The Gentlemen looked upon one another but were silent I proceeded  Le us set this matter in its true light Here is a  young woman who had suffered herself to be embarrassed in a treaty that her whole heart she assures me was never in  This was her fault  But know we not how inextricable are the entanglements of  Love  as it is called when young women are brought to enter into correspondence with men Our Sex have opportunities of knowing the world which the other have not Experience gentlemen engaging with inexperience and perhaps to the difference of twice the number of years Sir said the Captain the combat must be too unequal How artfully do men endeavour to draw in the women whom they think it worth their while to pursueBut would any man here wish to marry a woman who declares that she was insensibly drawn in beyond her purpose Who shewed when she refused to promise that she would be his in preference to all other men that she did not love him above all other men Who when she was prevailed on to fetter herself made him not of consequence enough to herself to bind  him  And in a word who has long ago declared to him and steadily persists in the declaration That she  never  will be hisYou seem gentlemen to be men of spirit Would you wish to marry the first woman on earth on these terms if you  could  obtain herwhich however is not the case since Miss Grandison's promise extends not so far as to oblige her to marry Captain Anderson  The Captain did not he told me like some part of what I had said and still less some of the words I had usedAnd seemed to be disposing his features to take a livelier turn than became the occasion I interrupted him therefore I meet you not Captain said I either to hear or to obviate cavils upon words When I have told you that I came with an amicable intention I expect to be believed I intend not offence But let us be  men  I am perhaps a younger man by ten years than any one present but I have seen the  world as much as any man of my age and know what is due to the character of a Gentleman whether it be captain Anderson's or my own And expect not wilful misconstructions  All I mean is Sir said the Captain that I will not be treated contemptuously no not even by the brother of Miss Grandison  The brother of Miss Grandison Sir is not accustomed to treat any man contemptuously Don't treat yourself so and you are safe from unworthy treatment from me Let me add Sir that I permit every man to six his character with me as he pleases I will venture to say I have a large charity but I extend it not to tameness But yet will always allow a third person to decide upon the justice of my intentions and actions  The Captain said That he ascribed a great deal of my sister's  positiveness in her denial of him  those were his words to the time of my arrival in  England  and he doubted not that I had encouraged the proposals either of Sir Walter Watkyns or of Lord G because of their quality and fortunes And hence his difficulties were encreased  And then up he rose slapt one hand upon the table put the other on his sword and was going to say some very fierce things prefacing them with damning his blood when I stood up Hold Captain be calm if possibleHear from me the naked truth I willmake you a fair representation and when I have done do you resume if you think it necessary that angry air you got up with and see what you'll make of it  His friends interposed He sat down half out of breath with anger His swelled features went down by degrees  The truth of the matter is strictly and briefly this  All my sister's difficulties which perhaps were greater in apprehension than in fact ended with my  father's life I made it my business on my arrival as soon as possible to ascertain my sister's fortunes Lord L married▪ the elder The two gentlemen you have mentioned made their addresses to the younger I knew nothing of you Captain Anderson My sister had wholly kept the affair between you and her in her own breast She had not revealed it even to her sister The reason she gives and to which you Sir could be no stranger was That she was determined never to be yours The subject requires explicitness Captain Anderson And I am not accustomed to palliate whenever it does She hoped to prevail upon you to leave her as generously free as she had left you I do assure you upon my honour that she favours not either of the gentlemen I know not the man she  does  favour It is I her brother not herself that am solicitous for her marrying And upon the indifference she expressed to change her condition on terms to which no objection could be made I supposed she must have a secret preference to some other man I was afterwards informed that letters had passed between her and you by a Lady who had it from a Gentleman of your acquaintance You have shewn me Sir by the presence of these Gentlemen that you were not so careful of the secret as my sister had been  I charged my sister upon this discovery with reserve to me But offered her my service in her own way assuring her that if her heart were engaged the want of quality title and fortune should not be of weight with me and that whomsoever she accepted for her husband him would I receive for my brother  The colonel and the Major extravagantly applauded a behaviour on this occasion which deserved no more than a common approbation▪  She solemnly assured me proceeded I that altho' she held herself bound by the promise which youth  inexperience and solicitation had drawn her in to make she resolved to perform it by a perpetual single life if it were insisted upon And thus Sir you see that it depends upon you to keep Charlotte Grandison a single woman till you marry some other Lady A power let me tell you that no man ought to seek to obtain over any young woman or generously to acquit her of it and leave her as free as she has left youAnd now gentlemen to the Major and Colonel if you come hither not so much parties as judges I leave this matter upon your consideration and will withdraw for a few moments  I left every mouth ready to burst into words and walked into the public room There I met with Colonel Martin whom I had seen abroad and who had just asked after Major Dillon He to my great surprize took notice to me of the business that brought me thither  You see my sister the consequences you were of to Captain Anderson He had not been able to forbear boasting of the honour which a daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison had done him and of his enlarged prospects by her interest Dear CharlotteHow unhappy was the man that your pride should make you think yourself concern'd to keep secret an affair that he thought a glory to him to make known to many For we see shall I not say to the advantage of this gentleman's character that he has many  dear  and  inseparable friends  from whom he  concealed not any secret of his heart  Colonel Mackenzie came out soon after and we withdrew to the corner of the room He talked a great deal of the strength of the captain's passion of the hopes he had conceived of making his fortune thro' the interest of a family to which he imputed consideration He made me a great many compliments He talk'd of the great detriment this longsuspended affair had been to his friend and told me  with a grave countenance that the Captain was grown as many years older as it had been in hand and was ready to rate very highly so much time lost in the prime of life In short he ascribed to the Captain the views and the disappointments of a military fortunehunter too plainly for his honour in my eye had I been disposed to take  proper  notice of the meaning of what he said  After having heard him out I desired the Colonel to let me know what all this meant and what were the Captain's expectations  He paraded on again a long time and asked me at last If there were no hopes that the Lady  None at all interrupted I She ha steadily declared as much Charlotte Grandison is a woman of fine sense She had great qualities She has insuperable objections to the Captain which are founded on a more perfect knowledge of the man and of her own heart than she could have at first It is not my intention to depreciate him with his friend I shall not therefore enter into particulars Let me know Colonel what the gentleman pretends to He is passionate I see I am not a tame man But God forbid that Captain Anderson who hoped to be benefited by an alliance with the daughter of Sir Thomas Grandison should receive hurt or hard treatment from her brother  Here Colonel Martin who had heard something of what was said desired to speak with Colonel Mackenzie They were not so distant but my ear unavoidably caught part of their subject Colonel Martin expatiated in a very high manner on my character when I was abroad He imputed bravery to me a great article among military men and with you Ladies and I know not how many good qualitiesAnd Colonel Mackenzie took him in with him to the other two gentlemen Where I suppose everything that had passed was repeated  After a while I was desired by Colonel Martin in the name of the gentlemen to walk in he himself sitting down in the public room  They received me with respect I was obliged to hear and say a great many things that I had said and heard before But at last two proposals were made me either of which they said if complied with would be taken as laying the Captain under very high obligation  Poor man I had compassion for him and closed with one of them declining the other for a reason which I did not give to them To say truth Charlotte I did not choose to promise my  interest  in behalf of a man of whose merit I was not assured had I been able to challenge any as perhaps I might by Lord W's means who stands well with proper persons A man ought to think himself in some measure accountable for  warm  recommendations especially where the public is concerned And could I give my promise and be cool as to the performance And I should think myself also answerable to a worthy man and to every one connected with him if I were a means of lifting one less worthy over his head I chose therefore to do that service to him for which I am responsible only to  myself  After I have said this my sister must ask me no questions  I gave a rough draught at the Captain's request of the manner in which I would have releases drawn Colonel Martin was desired to walk in And all the gentlemen promised to bury in silence and all that had ever come to their knowlege of what had passed between Charlotte Grandison and Captain Anderson  Let not the mentioning to you these measures hurt you my sister Many young Ladies of sense and family have been drawn into still greater inconveniencies than you have suffered Persons of eminent abilities I have a very high opinion of my Charlotte's seldom err in  small  points Most young women who  begin a correspondence with our designing Sex think they can stop when they will But it is not so We and the dark spirit that sets us at work which we sometimes miscall Love will not permit you to do so Men and Women are Devils to one another They need no other tempter  All will be completed to morrow and your written promise of consequence given up I congratulate my sister on the happy conclusion of this affair You are now your own mistress and free to choose for yourself I should never forgive myself were I who have been the means of freeing you from one controul to endeavour to lay you under another Think not either of Sir Walter or of Lord G if your heart declare not in favour of either You have sometimes thought me  carnest  in behalf of Lord G But I have never spoken in his favour but when you have put me upon answering objections to him which I have thought insufficient And indeed Charlotte some of your objections have been so slight that I was ready to believe you put them for the pleasure of having them answered  My Charlotte need not doubt of admirers whereever she sets her foot And I repeat that whoever be the man she inclines to favour she may depend upon the approbation and good offices of  Her everaffectionate brother CHARLES GRANDISON  LETTER XXXIII Miss  HARRIET BYRON  To Miss  SELBY  Friday Mar  I SEND you inclosed to be returned by the first opportunity Sir Charles's Letter to his sister acquainting her with the happy conclusion of the affair between Captain Anderson and her Her brother as  you will see▪ acquits her not of precipitation If he did it would have been an impeachment of this justice O the dear Charlotte how her pride is piqued at the meanness of the man But no more of this subject as the Letter is before you  And now my dear and honoured friends let me return you a thousand thanks for the great pacquet of my Letters just sent me with a most indulgent one from my aunt and another from my uncle  I have already put into the two Ladies and my Lord's without reserve all the Letters that reach to the masquerade affair from the time of my setting out for London and when they have heard those I have promised them more This confidence has greatly obliged them and they are employed with no small earnestness in perusing them  This gives me an opportunity of pursuing my own devicesAnd what besides scribling do you think one of them isA kind of persecution of Dr Bartlett by which however I suspect that I myself am the greatest sufferer He is an excellent man and I make no difficulty of going to him in his closet encouraged by his assurances of welcome  Let me stop to say my Lucy that when I approach this good man in his retirement surrounded by his books his table generally covered with those on pious subjects I in my heart congratulate the saint and inheritor of future glory and in that great view am the more desirous to cultivate his friendship  And what do you think is our subject Sir Charles I suppose you guessAnd so it is either in the middle or latter end of the few conversations we have yet had time to hold But I do assure you we begin with the sublimest tho' I must say to my shame that it has not so much of my heart at present as once it had and I hope again it will one day haveThe great and glorious truths of Christianity are this subject which  yet  from this good Dr Bartlett  warms my heart as often as he enters into it But this very subject sublime as it is brings on the other as of consequence For Sir Charles Grandison without making an ostentatious pretension to religion is the very Christian in practice that these doctrines teach a man to be Must not then the doctrines introduce the mention of a man who endeavours humbly to imitate the Divine example It was upon good grounds he once said That as he must one day die it was matter of no moment to  him  whether it were tomorrow or forty years hence  The Ladies had referred me to the Doctor himself for a more satisfactory account than they had given me how Sir Charles and he first came acquainted I told him so and asked his indulgence to me in this enquiry  He took it kindly He had he said the history of it written down His nephew whom he often employs as his amanuensis should make me out from that little history an account of it which I might shew he was pleased to say to such of my select friends as I entrusted with the knowlege of my own heart  I shall impatiently expect the abstract of this little history and the more as the Doctor tells me there will be included some particulars of Sir Charles's behaviour abroad in his younger life and of Mr Beauchamp whom the Doctor speaks of with love as his patron's dearest friend and whom he calls a second Sir Charles Grandison  SEE my Lucy the reward of frankness of heart My communicativeness has been already encouraged with the perusal of two Letters from the same excellent man to Doctor Bartlett to whom from early days as I shall be soon more particularly informed he has given an account of all his conduct and movements  The Doctor drew himself in however by reading to Lord L and the Ladies and me a paragraph or two out of one of them And he has even allowed me to give my grandmamma and aunt a sight of them Return them Lucy with the other Letter by the very next post He says he can deny me nothing I wish I may not be too bold with himAs for Miss Grandison she vows that she will not let the good man rest till she gets him to communicate what he shall not absolutely declare to be a secret to  as  three sisters and my Lord L If the first man she says could not resist  one  woman how will the Doctor deal with  three  not one of them behindhand with the  first  in curiosity And all loving him and whom he prosesses to esteem You see Lucy that Miss Grandison has pretty well got up her spirits again  JUST now Miss Grandison has related to me a conversation that passed between my Lord and Lady L herself and Doctor Bartlett In which the subject was their brother and me The Ladies and my Lord are entirely in my interests and regardful of my punctilio They roundly told the Doctor That being extremely earnest to have their brother marry they knew not the person living whom they wished to call his wife preferably to Miss Byron could they be sure that I was absolutely disengaged Now Doctor said Miss Grandison tell us frankly What is your opinion of our choice for a more than nominal sister  I will make no apologies Lucy for repeating all that was repeated to me of this conversation  Lord L  Ay my good Doctor Bartlett let us have your free opinion  Dr B  Miss Byron I pronounce upon knowledge for she has more than once since I have been down done me the honour of entering into very free and serious conversations with me is one of the most excellent of women  And then he went on praising me for ingenuousness seriousness chearfulness and for other good qualities which his partiality found out in me And added Would to heaven that she were neither more nor less than Lady Grandison  God bless him thought IDon't you join my Lucy to say at this place you who love me so dearly God bless you Doctor Bartlett  Lady L  Well but Doctor you say that Miss Byron talks freely with you cannot you gather from her whether she is inclined to marriage Whether she is absolutely disengaged Lady D made a proposal to her for Lord D and insisted on an answer to this very question That matter is gone off As our  guest  we would not have Miss Byron think us impertinent She is very delicate And as she is so amiably frankhearted those things she chooses not to mention of her own accord one would not you know officiously put to her  This was a little too much affected Don't you think so Lucy The Doctor it is evident by his answer did  Dr B  It is not likely that such a subject can arise between Miss Byron and me And it is strange methinks that Ladies calling each other sisters should not be absolutely mistresses of this question  Lord L  Very right Doctor Bartlett But Ladies will in these points take a compass before they explain themselves A man of Doctor Bartlett's penetration and uprightness Ladies should not be treated with distance We are of opinion Doctor that Miss Byron supposing that she is absolutely disengaged could make no difficulty to prefer my brother to all the men in the world What think you  Dr B  I have no doubt of it She thinks herself under obligations to him She is goodness itself She must love goodness Sir Charles's person his vivacity his address his understandingWhat woman would  not prefer him to all the men she ever saw He has met with admirers among the Sex in every nation in which he has set his foot Ah Lucy You Ladies must have seen forgive me bowing to each that Miss Byron has a more than grateful respect for your brother  Miss Gr  We think so Doctor and wanted to know if  you  did And so as my Lord says fetched a little compass about which we should not have done to  you  But you say That my brother has had numbers of admirersPray Doctor is there any  one  Lady We imagine there is that he has preferred to another in the different nations he has travelled through  Lord L  Ay Doctor we want to know this and if you thought there were  not  we should make no scruple to explain ourselves as well to Miss Byron as to my brother  Don't you long to know what answer the Doctor returned to this Lucy I was out of breath with impatience when Miss Grandison repeated it to me  The Doctor hesitatedAnd at last said I wish with all my heart Miss Byron could be Lady Grandison  Miss Gr  COUD be  Could  be said each  And COULD be said the fool to Miss Grandison when she repeated it her heart quite sunk  Dr B  smiling You hinted Ladies that you are not  sure  that Miss Byron is absolutely disengaged But to be open and aboveboard I have reason to believe that your brother would be concerned if he knew it that you should think of putting such a question as this to anybody but himself Why don't you He once complained to me that he was afraid his sisters looked upon him as a reserved man and condescended to call upon me to put him right if I thought his appearance such as would give you grounds for the surmise There are two or three  affairs of intricacy that he engaged in and particularly one that hangs in suspence and he would not be fond I believe of mentioning it till he can do it with certainty But else Ladies there is not a more frankhearted man in the world than  your  brother  See Lucy how cautious we ought to be in passing judgment on the actions of others especially on those of good men when we want to fasten blame upon them perhaps with a low view envying their superior worth to bring them down to our own levelFor are we not all apt to measure the merits of others by our own standard to give praise or dispraise to actions or sentiments as they square with their own  Lord L  Perhaps Doctor Bartlett you don't think yourself at liberty to answer whether these particular affairs are of such a nature as will interfere with the  hopes  we have of bringing to effect a marriage between my brother and Miss Byron  Dr B  I had rather refer to Sir Charles himself on this subject If any man in the world deserves from prudence and integrity of heart to be happy in this life that man is Sir Charles Grandison But he is not  quite  happy  Ah LucyThe Doctor proceeded Your brother Ladies has often said to me That there was hardly a man living who had a more sincere value for the Sex than he had who had been more distinguished by the favour of worthy women yet who had paid dearer for that distinction than he had done  Lady L  Paid dearer Good Heaven  Miss Gr  How could that be  Lord L  I always abroad heard the Ladies reckon upon Sir Charles as their own man His vivacity his personal accomplishments his politeness his generosity his braveryEvery woman who spoke of him put him down for a man of gallantry And is he not a  truly  gallant manI never mentioned it  beforeBut a Lady Olivia of Florence was much talked of when I was in that city as being in love with the handsome Englishman as our brother was commonly called there  Lady Olivia Lady Olivia repeated each sister and why did not your Lordship  Why Because tho' she was in love with him he had no thoughts of her And as the Doctor says she is but  one  of those who admired him whereever he set his foot  Bless me thought I what a black swan is a good manWhy as I have often thought to the credit of our Sex will not all the men be good  Lady L  My Lord you must tell us more of this Lady Olivia  Lord L  I know very little more of her She was reputed to be a woman of high quality and fortune and great spirit I once saw her She is a fine figure of a woman Dr Bartlett can no doubt give you an account of her  Miss Gr  Ah Doctor What an history could you give us of our brother if you pleasedBut as there is no likelihood that this Lady will be anything to my brother let us return to our first subject  Lady L  By all means Pray Dr Bartlett do you know what my brother's opinion is of Miss Byron  Dr B  The highest that man can have of woman  Lady L  As we are so very desirous to see my brother happily married and think he never could have a woman so likely to make him happy would you advise us to propose the alliance to him We would not to  her  unless we thought there were room to hope for his approbation and that in a very high degree  Dr B  I am under some concern my dear Ladies to be thought to know more of your brother's heart than sisters do whom he loves so dearly and who equally love him I beseech you give me not so  much more consequence with him than you imagine you have yourselves I shall be afraid if you do that the favour I wish to stand in with you is owing more to your brother's distinction of me than to your own hearts  Lord L  I see not why we may not talk to my brother directly on this head Whence is it that we are all three insensibly drawn in by each other's example to this distance between him and usIt is not  his  fault Did we ever ask him a question that he did not directly answer and that without shewing the least affectation or reserve  Miss Gr  He came over to us all at once so perfect after an eight or nine years absence with so much power and such a will to do us good that we were awed into a kind of reverence for him  Lady L  Too great obligations from one side will indeed create distance on the other Grateful hearts will always retain a sense of favours heaped upon them  Dr B  You would give pain to his noble heart did he think that you put such a value upon what he has done I do assure you▪ that he thinks he has hardly performed his duty by his sisters And as occasions may still offer you will  find  he thinks so But let me beg of you to treat him without reserve or diffidence and that you would put to him all those questions which you would wish to be answered You will find him I dare say very candid and very explicit  Miss Gr  That shall be my task when I next see him But dear Doctor Bartlett if you love us communicate to us all that is proper for us to see of the correspondence that passes between him and you  The Doctor it seems bowed but answered not  So you see Lucy upon the whole that I have no great  reason  to build so much as my uncle in his last Letter imagines I do on the interest of these Ladies and my Lord L with their brother  Two or three  intricate affairs on his hands  One of them  still in suspense  of which for that reason he makes a secret He is not  quite happy Greatly distinguished by the favour of worthy women  Who would wonder at thatBut  has paid dear for the distinction  What can one say What can one think He once said himself That his life was a various life and that some unhappy things had befallen him If the prudence of such a man could not shield him from misfortune who can be exempted from itAnd from  worthy  women tooThat's the wonderBut is this Olivia one of the  worthy  womenI fancy he must despise us all I fancy he will never think of incumbering himself with one of a Sex that has made him pay so dear for the general distinction he has met with from it As to his politeness to us a man may afford to shew politeness to those he has resolved to keep at distance  But ah LucyThere must be one happy woman whom he wishes  not  to keep at distance This is the affair that  hangs in suspence  and of which therefore he chooses to say nothing  I HAVE had the pleasure of a visit from my godfather Deane He dined with us this day in his way to town The Ladies Doctor Bartlett and my Lord L are charmed with him Yet I had pain mingled with my pleasure He took me aside and charged me  so  homeHe was  too  inquisitive I never knew him to be so  very  urgent to know my heart But I was frank Very frank I should hardly have been excuseable if I had not to so good a man and so dear a friend Yet he scarce knew how to be satisfied with my frankness  He will have it that I look thinner and paler than I used to do That may very well be My very  soul  at timesI know not how I amSir Charles is in suspense too from somebody abroad From my heart I  pity him Had he but some faults some great blemishes I fancy I should be easier about him But to hear nothing of him but what is so greatly praiseworthy and my heart so delighted with acts of beneficenceAnd now my godfather Deane at this visit running on in his praises and commending instead of blaming me for my presumptuous thoughts nay exalting me and telling me That I deserve himthat I deserve Sir Charles GrandisonWhy did he not chide me Why did he not dissuade meNeither fortune nor merit answerableA man who knows so well what to do with fortuneThe Indies my dear ought to be his What a king would he make Power could not corrupt such a mind as his Caesar said Dr Bartlett speaking of him before Mr Deane and all of us was not quicker to destroy than Sir Charles Grandison is to relieve Emily's eye at the time ran over with joy at the expression and drying them she looked proudly round on us all as if she had said This is my guardian  But what do you think Lucy My godfather will have it that he sees a young passion in Miss Jervois for her guardianGod forbidA young Love may be conquered I believe but  who  shall caution the innocent girl She must have a sweet pleasure in it creeping stealing upon her How can so unexperienced an heart the object so meritorious resist or reject the indulgence But O my Emily sweet girl do not let your Love get the better of your gratitude lest it make you unhappy and what would be still more affecting to a worthy heart make the generous object of a passion that cannot be gratified unhappy and for  that  very reason because he cannot reward it See you not already that with all his goodness he is not quite happy He is a sufferer from  worthy  womenO my Emily do not  you  add to the infelicity of a man who can make but  one  woman happy yet wishes to befriend all the worldBut hush selfish adviser Should not Harriet Byron have thought of this in timeYet she knew not that he had any preivous engagements And may death lay his cold hand upon her heart before she become an additional disturbance to his He knows not I hope he guesses not tho' Dr Bartlett has found me out as well as the sisters that I am captivated heart and soul by his merits May he never know it if the knowledge of it would give him the shadow of uneasiness  I owned to Mr Deane that my Lord L and the Ladies were warmly interested in my favour Thank God for that he said All must happen to his wish Nay he would have it that Sir Charles's goodness would be  rewarded  in having such a wife But what wife can do more than her duty to any husband who is not absolutely a savage How then can all I could do  reward  such a man as this  But Lucy don't you blush for me on reading this last page of my writing You  may  since I blush myself on reperusing it For shame Harriet Byron put a period to this LetterI will nor subscribe to it so much as the initials of my name  LETTER XXXIV Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT  Inclosed in the preceding  Friday Mar  LAST night I saw interred the remains of my worthy friend Dr Danby I had caused his two nephews and his niece to be invited But they did not attend  As the will was not to be opened till the funeral  was over about which the good man had given me verbal directions apprehending I believe expostulations from me had I known the contents I sent to them this morning to be present at the opening  Their Attorney Mr Sylvester a man of character and good behaviour brought me a Letter signed by all three excusing themselves on very slight pretences and desiring that  he  might be present for them I took notice to him that the behaviour of his principals overnight and now was neither respectful to the memory of their uncle nor civil with regard to me He honestly owned that Mr Danby having acquainted his two nephews a little before he died that he had made his will and that they had very little to expect from him they who had been educated by his direction and made merchants at his expence with hopes given them that he would at his death do very handsomely for them and had never disobliged him could not be present at the opening of a will the contents of which they expected to be so mortifying to them  I opened it in presence of this gentleman The preamble was an angry one giving reasons for his resentment against the father of these young persons who tho' his brother had once as I hinted to you at Colnebrooke made a very shocking attempt upon his life I was hurt however to find a resentment carried so far as against the innocent children of the offender and into the last will of so good a man that will so lately made as within three weeks of his death and he given over for three months before  Will the tenderness due to the memory of a friend permit me to ask where would that resentment have stopt had the private man been a monarch which he could carry into his last will  But see we not on the other hand that these  children had they power would have punished their uncle for disposing as he thought fit of his own fortune no part of which came to him by inheritance  They had been educated as I have said at his expence and in the phrase of business well put out Expences their careless father would not have been at He is in every light a bad man How much better had these children's title been to a more considerable part of their uncle's estate than he has bequeathed to them had they been thankful for the benefits they had actually received Benefits which are of such a nature that they cannot be taken from them  Mr Danby has bequeathed to each of the three one thousand pounds but on express condition that they signify to his executor within two months after his demise their acceptance of it in full of all demands upon his estate If they do not tender being duly made the three thousand pounds are to be carried to the uses of the will  He then appoints his executor and makes him residuary legatee giving for reason that he had been the principal instrument in the hand of Providence of saving his life  He bequeaths some generous remembrances to three of his friends in France and requests his executor to dispose of three thousand pounds to charitable uses either in France or England as he thinks fit and to what particular objects he pleases  And by an inventory annexed to the will his effects in money bills actions and jewels are made to amount to upwards of thirty thousand pounds sterling  Mr Sylvester complimented me on this great  windfall  as he called it and assured me that it should be his advice to his clients that each take his and  her legacy and sit down contented with it And he believed that they the rather would as from what their uncle had hinted they apprehended that the sum of an hundred pounds each was all they had to hope for  I enquired into the inclinations and views of the three and received a very good general account of them with an hint that the girl was engaged in a Loveaffair  Their father after his vile attempt upon his brother's life was detested by all his friends and relations and went abroad and the last news they heard of him was that he was in a very ill state of health and in unhappy circumstances in Barbadoes And very probably by this time is no more  I desired Mr Sylvester to advise the young people to recollect themselves and said That I had a disposition to be kind to them And as he could give me only general accounts of their views prospects and engagements I wish'd they would with marks of confidence in me give me particular ones But that whether they complimented me as I wished or not I was determined for the sake of their uncle's memory to do all reasonable services to them Tell them in a word Mr Sylvester and do you forgive the seeming vanity That I am not accustomed to suffer the narrowness of other people's hearts to contract mine  The man went away very much pleased with what I had said and in about two hours sent me a note in the names of all his clients expressing gratitude and obligation and requesting me to allow him to introduce them all three to me this afternoon  I have some necessary things to do and persons to see in relation to my deceased friend which will be dispatched over a dish of tea And therefore I have invited the honest attorney and his three clients to sup with me  I will not send this to Colnebrooke where I hope you are all happy All must for are they not all good And are not  you  with them till I accompany it with the result of this evening's conversation Yet I am too fond of every occasion that offers to tell you what however you cannot doubt how much I am  yours  not to sign to that truth the name of  CHARLES GRANDISON  LETTER XXXV Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation  Friday night March  MR Sylvester an honest pleasure shining in his countenance presented to me first Miss Danby then each of her brothers who all received my welcome with a little consciousness as if they had something to reproach themselves with and were generously ashamed to be overcome The sister had the least of it And I saw by that that she was the least blameable not the least modest since I dare say she had but followed her brothers lead while they looked down and bashful as having all that was done amiss to answer for  Miss Danby is a very pretty and very genteel young woman Mr Thomas and Mr Edward Danby are agreeable in their persons and manners and want not sense  In the first moment I dissipated all their uneasiness and we sat down together with confidence in each other The honest attorney had prepared them to be easy after the first introduction  I offer not to read to you said I the will of your uncle It is sufficient to repeat what Mr Sylvester has no doubt told you That you are each of you entitled by it to a thousand pounds  They all bowed and the elder brother signified their united consent to accept it upon the terms of the will  Three thousand pounds more are to be disposed of to charitable uses at the discretion of the executor Three other legacies are left to three different gentlemen in France And the large remainder which will not be less than fourandtwenty thousand pounds falls to the executor as residuary legatee equally unexpected and undesired  The elder brother said God bless you with it Sir The second said It could not have fallen to a worthier man The young Lady's lips moved But words proceeded not from them Yet her eyes shewed that her lips made me a compliment  It is ungenerous Dr Bartlett to keep expecting minds in suspence tho' with a view of obliging in the end The surprize intended to be raised on such an occasion carries in its appearance an air of insult I have said I a great desire to do you service Now let me know gentlemen I will talk to the young Lady singly perhaps what your expectations were upon your uncle what will do for each of you to enable you to enter the world with advantage in the way you have been brought up and as I told your worthy friend Mr Sylvester I will be ready to do you all reasonable serviceBut hold Sir for Mr Thomas Danby was going to speak you shall consider before you answer me The matter is of importance Be explicit I love openness and sincerity I will withdraw till you have consulted together Command me in when you have determined  I withdrew to my study And in about a quarter of an hour they let me know that they were ready to attend me I went in to them They looked upon one another Come gentlemen don't fear to speak Consider me for your uncle's sake as your brother  The elder brother was going to speak but hesitating Come said I let me  lead  you into the matterPray Sir what is your present situation What are your present circumstances  My father Sir was unhappyMy father  Well Sir no more of your fatherHe  could  do nothing for you Your whole dependence I presume was upon your uncle  My uncle Sir gave us all our educationMy uncle gave each brother a thousand guineas for putting out each to a merchant five hundred only of which sums were so employed and the other five hundred guineas are in safe hands  Your uncle Sir all reverence to his memory was an excellent man  Indeed Sir he was  And what Sir is the business you were brought up to  My master is a WestIndia merchant  And what Mr Danby are your prospects in that way  Exceeding hopeful Sir they would have beenMy master intended to propose to my uncle had he lived to come to town to take me in a quarterpartner with him directly and in a twelvemonth's time an halfpartner  A very good sign in your favour Sir You must have behaved yourself well And will he now do it  Ah SirAnd was silent  Upon what terms Mr Danby would he have proposed to your uncle to take you in a quarterpartner  Sirhe talked of  Of what  Four thousand pounds Sir But my uncle never gave us hopes of more than three thousand guineas each besides the thousand he had given And when he had so much reason to resent the unhappy steps of  my father he let us know that he would not do  mything  for us And to say truth the thousand pounds left us in the will is more than we expected  Very ingenuous I love you for your sincerity But pray tell me Will four thousand pounds be well laid out in a quarterpartnership  To say truth Sir my master had a view at the year's end if nothing unexpected happened to prevent it to give me his niece in marriage and then to admit me into a half of the business which would be equivalent to a fortune of as much more  And do you love the young woman  Indeed I do  And does she countenance your address  If her uncleI don't doubt if  her  uncle could have prevailed upon  my  uncle  Well Sir I am your uncle's executor Now Sir to Mr Edward Danby let me know your Situation your prospects  Sir I was put to a French winemerchant My master is in years I am the sole manager of his business and he would leave off to me I believe and to his nephew who knows not so much of it as I do nor has the acquaintance either in France or England that I have could I raise money to purchase half the stock  And what Sir is necessary for that purpose  O Sir at least six thousand pounds But had my uncle left me the three thousand we once hoped for I could have got the other half at an easy interest for I am well beloved and have always borne a good character  What did you suppose your uncle would do with the bulk of his fortune you judged it I suppose to be large if you expected no more than three thousand guineas each at the most besides what he had given you  We all thought Sir said Mr Edward Danby it  would be  yours  from the time that he owed his life to your courage and conduct We never entertained hopes of being his heirs general And he several times told me when I was in France that  you  should be his heir  He never hinted that to me What I did was as necessary to be done for my own Safety as for his He much overrated my services But what are your prospects Mr Edward Danby in the French winetrade  O Sir very great  And will your master leave off to you and his nephew think you  I dare say he would and be glad of retiring to Enfield where he has a house he is so fond of that he would be continually there by his goodwill  And have you Sir any prospect of adding to your circumstances by marriage  Women are a drug Sir I have no doubt of offers if once I were my own master  I started His sister looked angry His brother was not pleased Mr Sylvester who it seems is an old bachelor laughed  A  true  merchant this already thought I  Well now shall I have your consents gentlemen to take your sister asideWill you trust yourself with me Miss Danby Or had you rather answer my question in company  Sir your character your goodness is so well known I scruple not to attend you  I took her hand and led her to my study leaving the door open to the drawingroom in which they were I seated her Then sat down but still held her hand  Now my dear Miss Danby you are to suppose me as the executor of your uncle his representative If you had that good uncle before you and he was urging you to tell him what would make you happy with  an assurance that he would do all in his power towards it and if you would open your mind freely to him with equal freedom open it to me There was only this difference between us He had resentments against your father which he carried too far when he extended them to his innocent children But it was an atrocious attempt that embitter'd his otherwise benevolent spirit I have no resentment and am armed with his power and have all the will he ever could have to serve you Aud now let me know what will effectually do it  The worthy girl wept She looked down She seemed as if she were pulling threads out of her handkerchief But was unable to return any other answer than what her eyes once cast up as if to Heaven made for her  Give me my good Miss Danby I would not distress you give me as your brothers did of  their  Situation some account of  yours  Do you live with either of your brothers  No Sir I live with an aunt My mother's sister  Is she good to you  Yes Sir very good But she has children and cannot be so good as she would be to me Yet she has always been kind and has made the best of my uncle's allowance for my education And my fortune which is unbroken is the same sum that he gave my brothers And it is in good hands And the interest of it with my aunt's additional goodness and management enables me to make a genteel figure And with my own housewifry I never have wanted some little matters for my pocket  Good girl thought IMercantile carle thy brother Edward pretty one How dared he to say that women are drugsWho in their oeconomy short as their power is are generally superior to men  Your uncle was very good to put you upon a foot with your brothers in his bounty to them as now he  has also done in his will And assure yourself that his representative will be equally kind to you as to your brothers But shall I ask you as your uncle would have doneIs there any one man in the world whom you prefer to another  She was silent looked down and again picked her handkerchief  I called in her elder brother not the drugmerchant and asked him What he knew of his sister's affections  Why my good Dr Bartlett are these women ashamed of owning a laudable passion Surely there is nothing shameful in  discreet  Love  Her brother acquainted me with the story of her Love the good girl blushing and looking down all the while with the consciousness of a sweet thief who had stolen a heart and being required to restore it had been guilty of a new cheat and given her own instead of it  The son of Mr Galliard an eminent Turkey merchant is the man with whom she has made this exchange His father who lives in the neighbourhood of her aunt had sent him abroad in the way of his traffick partly with a view to prevent his marrying Miss Danby till it should be seen whether her uncle would do anything considerable for her And he was but just returned and in order to be allowed to stay at home had promised his father never to marry without his consent But nevertheless loved his sister Mr Danby said above all women and declared that he never would be the husband of any other  I asked whether the father had any objections but those of fortune to his son's choice and was answered No He  could  have no other the young man like a brother said There was not a more virtuous and discreet young woman in the kingdom than his sister tho' he said it that should not say it  Tho' you say it that  should  say it Is not our  relation intitled to the same justice that we would do to another  We must not blame indiscriminately continued I all fathers who expect a fortune to be brought into their family in some measure equivalent to the benefit the newcomer hopes to receive from it especially in mercantile families if the young man is to be admitted into a share with his father who by the way  may  have other children  He has  Something by way of equivalent for the part he gives up should be done Love is a selfish Deity He puts two persons upon preferring their own interests nay a gratification of their passion often  against  their interests to those of everybody else and reason discretion duty are frequently given up in a competition with it But Love nevertheless will not do everything for the ardent pair Parents know this And ought not to pay for the rashness they wish to prevent but cannot  They were attentive I proceeded addressing myself to both in the mercantile style  Is a father who by his prudence has weathered many a storm and got safe into port obliged to reembark in the voyage of Life with the young folks who perhaps in a little while will consider him as an incumbrance and grudge him his cabin Parents tho' a young man I have always thought in this manner should be indulgent but children when they put themselves into one scale should allow the parent his due weight in the other You are angry at this father are you not my dear Miss Danby  I said this to hear what answer she would return  Indeed I am not Mr Galliard knows best his own affairs and what they require I have said so twenty and twenty times And young Mr Galliard is convinced that his father is not to be blamed having other children And to own the truth looking  on the floor we both sit down and wish together nowandthen But what signifies wishing  My sister will now have two thousand pounds Perhaps when old Mr Galliard sees that his son's affections  Old Mr Galliard interrupted I shall be asked to do nothing inconvenient to himself or that is not strictly right by his other children Nor shall the niece of my late worthy friend enter into his family with discredit to herself  Notice being given that supper was ready I took the brother and sister each by the hand and entering the drawingroom with them Enjoy said I the little repast that will be set before you If it be in my power to make you all three happy happy you shall be  It must give great pleasure my dear Dr Bartlett you will believe to a man of my lively sensations to see three very different faces in the same persons from those they had entered with I imagined more than once as the grateful eyes of the sister and tongues of the brothers expressed their joy that I saw my late worthy friend looking down upon us delighted and not with disapprobation upon his choice of an executor who was determined to supply the defects which the frailty of human nature by an everstrong resentment on one hand and an overflowing gratitude on the other had occasioned  I told Mr Thomas Danby that besides his legacy he might reckon upon five thousand pounds and enter accordingly into treaty for and with his master's niece  Mr Edward Danby I commissioned on the strength of the like additional sum to treat with the gentleman he had served  And you my good Miss Danby said I shall acquaint your favoured Mr Galliard That besides the two thousand pounds already yours you will have five  thousand pounds more at his service And if these sums answer not your full purposes I expect you will let me know since whether they do or not my respect to the memory of your worthy uncle shall be shewn to the value of more than these three sums to his relations I never will be a richer man than I ought to be And you must inform me what other relations you have and of their different situations in life that I may be enabled to amend a will made in a long and painful sickness which might four a disposition that was naturally all benevolence  They wept looked at one another dried their eyes and wept again Mr Sylvester also wept for joy I thought my presence painful to them and withdrew to my Study and shut the door that I might not add to their pain  At my returnDo youDo you referred each brother to the other And Mr Thomas Danby getting up to speak I see my friends said I your grateful hearts in your countenances Do you think my pleasure is not at least equal to yours I am  more  than rewarded in the consciousness of having endeavoured to make a right use of the power entrusted to me You will each of you I hope thus set forward be eminent in his particular business The merchants of Great Britain are the most useful members of the community If I have obliged you let me recommend to you each in his several way according to his ability and as opportunity may offer to raise those worthy hearts that inevitable calamities shall make spiritless Look upon what is done for you not as the reward of any particular merits in yourselves but as your debt to that Providence which makes it a principal part of your religion To do good to your fellowcreatures In a word let me enjoin you in all your transactions to  remember mercy  as well as  justice  The brothers with folded hands declared that  their hearts were opened by the example set them and they hoped would never be shut The sister  looked  the same declaration  Mr Sylvester raised with this scene of gratitude tears in his honest eyes said That he should be impatient till he had looked into his affairs and thro' his acquaintance in order to qualify himself to do some little good after such a  selfrewarding  example  If a private man my dear Dr Bartlett could be a means of expanding thus the hearts of four persons none of them unworthy what good might not princes and those who have princely fortunes doYet you see I have done nothing but mere justice I have not given up anything that was my own before this Will gave me a power that perhaps was put into my hands as a new trial of the integrity of my heart  But what poor creatures are we my dear friend that the very avoiding the occasion of a wrong action should gladden our hearts as with the consciousness of something meritorious  At parting I told the nephews That I expected to hear from them the moment anything should be brought to effect and let their masters and them agree or not I would take the speediest methods that could be fallen upon to transfer to them and to their sister such actions and stocks as would put them in full possession of what they were intitled to as well by my promise as by their uncle's will  I was obliged to injoin them silence  Their sister wept and when I pressed her hand at taking leave of her gratefully returned the pressure but in a manner so modest recollecting herself into some little confusion that shewed gratitude had possession of her whole heart and set her above the forms of her sex  The good attorney as much raised as if he were one of the persons benefited joined with the two brothers in invoking blessings upon me  So much my dear Dr Bartlett for this night The past day is a day that I am not displeased with  LETTER XXXVI Dr  BARTLETT  To Miss  BYRON  March  I Present to you madam the account you desired to see as extracted by my kinsman from my papers You seemed to wish it to be hastened for you It is not what it might have been but more facts I presume will answer your intention Be pleased therefore to accept it with your usual goodness  "DR Bartlett went abroad as governor of a young man of quality Mr Lorimer I am to call him to conceal his real name He was the very reverse of young Mr Grandison He was not only rude and ungovernable but proud illnatured malicious even base  "The Doctor was exceedingly averse to take upon him the charge of the wicked youth abroad having had too many instances of the badness of his nature while in England But he was prevailed upon by the solicitations of his father who represented it as an act of the greatest charity to him and his family as well as by the solemn promises of good behaviour from the young man for he was known to regard the advice of Dr Bartlett more than that of any other person  "The Doctor and Mr Lorimer were at Turin when young Mr Grandison who had been some months in France for the first time arrived in that city then in the eighteenth year of his age  "Dr Bartlett had not a more profligate pupil than Mr Grandison had a governor tho' recommended by General W his uncle by the mother's side It  used to be observed in places where they made but a few days residence that the young gentleman ought to have been the governor Monsieur Creutzer the governed Mr Grandison had in short the happiness by his prudence to escape several snares laid for his virtue by a wretch who hoped if he could betray him into them to silence the remonstrances of the young man upon his evil conduct and to hinder him from complaining of him to his father  "Mr Grandison became acquainted with Dr Bartlett at Turin Monsieur Creutzer at the same time commenced an intimacy with Mr Lorimer and the two former were not more united from good qualities than the two latter were from bad  "Several riotous things were done by Creutzer and Lorimer who whatever the Doctor could do to separate them were hardly ever asunder One of their enormities fell under the cognizance of the civil magistrate and was not made easy to Lorimer without great interest and expence While Creutzer fled to Rome to avoid condign punishment and wrote to Mr Grandison to join him there  "Then it was that Mr Grandison wrote as he had often ineffectually threatened to do to represent to his father the profligacy of the man and to request him to appoint him another governor or to permit him to return to England till he had made choice of one for him begging of Dr Bartlett that he would allow him 'till he had an answer from his father to apply to him for advice and instruction  "The answer of his father was That he heard of his prudence from every mouth That he was at liberty to chuse what  companion  he pleased But that he gave him no  governor  but his own discretion  "Mr Grandison then more earnestly than before and with an humility and diffidence suited to his natural generosity of temper that never grew upon indulgence besought the Doctor's direction  And when they were obliged to separate they established a correspondence which never will end but with the life of one of them  "Mr Grandison laid before the Doctor all his plans submitting his conduct to him as well with regard to the prosecution of his studies as to his travels But they had not long corresponded in this manner when the Doctor let him know that it was needless to consult him  aforehand  and the more so as it often occasioned a suspension of excellent resolutions But he besought him to continue to him an account of all he undertook of all he performed and of every material incident of his life not only as his narrations would be matter of the highest entertainment to him but as they would furnish him with lessons from example that might be of greater force upon the unhappy Lorimer than his own precepts  "While the Doctor was passing thro' but a few of the cities in Lombardy Mr Grandison made almost the tour of Europe and yet gave himself time to make such remarks upon persons places and things as could hardly be believed to be the observations of so young a man Lorimer mean time was engaged in shews fpectacles and in the diversions of the places in  which he lived  as it might be said rather than  thro' which he passed  "The Doctor at one time was the more patient with these delays as he was willing that the carnival at Venice should be over before he suffered his pupil to go to that city But Lorimer suspecting his intention slipt thither unknown to his governor at the very beginning of it and the Doctor was forced to follow him And when there had the mortification of  hearing  of him for the young man avoided his governor as much as possible as one of the most riotous persons there  "In vain did the Doctor when he saw his pupil set before him the example of Mr Grandison a  younger man All the effect the Letters he used to read to him had upon him was to make him hate the more both his Governor and Mr Grandison By one Letter only did he do himself temporary credit It was written some months before it was shewn him in which Mr Grandison described some places of note thro' which he had passed and thro' which the Doctor and his charge had also more lately passed The mean creature contrived to steal it and his father having often urged for a specimen of his son's observations on his travels he copied it almost verbatim and transmitted it as his own to his father only letting the Doctor know after he had sent it away that he  had  written  "The Doctor doubted not but Lorimer had exposed himself but was very much surprised when he received a congratulatory Letter from the father on his son's improvements mingled with some little asperity on the Doctor for having set out his son to his disadvantage "I could not doubt" said the fond father "that a son of mine had genius He wanted nothing but to apply"And then he gave orders for doubling the value of his next remittance  "The Doctor took the young gentleman to task about it He owned what he had done and gloried in his contrivance But his governor thought it incumbent upon him to undeceive the father and to save him the extraordinary part of his remittance  "The young man was enraged at the Doctor for  exposing  him as he called it to his father and for the check he was continually giving to his lawless appetites and falling into acquaintance with a courtezan who was infamous for ruining many young travellers by her subtle and dangerous contrivances they joined in a resolution to revenge themselves on the Doctor whom they considered as their greatest enemy  "Several projects they fell upon One in particular  was to accuse him by a third hand as concerning himself with affairs of state in Venice A crime which in that jealous republic is never overlooked and generally ends fatally for the accused who if seized is hardly ever heard of afterwards From this danger he narrowly escaped by means of his general good character and remarkable inoffensiveness and the profligateness of his accusers Nor knew he his danger till many months afterwards The Doctor believes that he fared the better for being an Englishman and a governor to the son of a British nobleman who made so considerable a figure in England because the Italians in general reap so much advantage from the travellers of this nation that they are ready to favour and encourage them above those of any other  "The Doctor had been very solicitous to be acquitted of his ungracious charge In every Letter he wrote to England this was one of his prayers But still the father who knew not what to do with his son at home had besought his patience and wrote to his son in the strongest terms after reproaching him for his ungraciousness to pay an implicit obedience to the Doctor  "The father was a learned man Great pains had been taken with Lorimer to make him know something of the antient Greek and Roman histories The father was  very  desirous that his son should see the famous places of old Greece of which he himself had read so much And with great difficulty the Doctor got the young man to leave Venice where the vile woman and the diversions of the place had taken scandalous hold of him  "Athens was the city at which the father had desired they would make some stay and from thence visit other parts of the Morea And there the young man found his woman got before him according to private agreement between them  "It was some time before the Doctor found out that the very woman who had acted so abandoned a part with Lorimer at Venice was his mistress at Athens And when he did he applied on some fresh enormities committed by Lorimer to the tribunal which the Christians have there consisting of eight venerable men chosen out of the eight quarters of the city to determine causes among Christians and they taking cognizance of the facts the wicked woman suborned wretches to accuse the Doctor to the Cadi who is the Turkish judge of the place as a dangerous and disaffected person and the Cadi being as it was supposed corrupted by presents got the Vayvode or Governor to interfere and the Doctor was seized and thrown into prison His Christian friends in the place were forbidden to interpose in his favour and pen and ink and all access to him were prohibited  "The vile woman having concerted measures with the persons she had suborned for continuing the Doctor in his severe confinement set out with her paramour for Venice and there they rioted as before  "Mr Beauchamp a young man of learning and fine parts happened to make an acquaintance with Mr Grandison in the island of Candia where they met as countrymen which from a sympathy of minds grew immediately into an intimacy that will hardly ever end This young gentleman in the course of his travels visiting Athens about this time was informed of the Doctor's misfortune by one of the eight Christians who constituted the tribunal abovementioned and who was an affectionate friend of the Doctor tho' forbidden to busy himself in his cause And Mr Beauchamp who had heard Mr Grandison speak of the Doctor with an uncommon affection knowing that Mr Grandison was then at Constantinople dispatched a man on purpose to acquaint him with the affair and with all the particulars he could get of the case authenticated as much as the nature of the thing would admit  "Mr Grandison was equally grieved and astonished at the information He instantly applied to the English embassador at the Porte as also to the French minister there with whom he had made an acquaintance They to the Grand Vizir And an order was issued for setting the Doctor at liberty Mr Grandison in order to urge the dispatch of the Chiaux who carried it accompanied him and arrived at Athens just as the Vayvode had determined to get rid of the whole affair in a private manner the Doctor's finances being exhausted by the bowstring The danger endeared the Doctor to Mr Grandison a relief so seasonable endeared Mr Grandison to the Doctor to them  both  Mr Beauchamp who would not stir from Athens till he had seen him delivered having busied himself in the interim in the best manner he could tho' he was obliged to use caution and secrecy to do him service and to suspend the fatal blow  "Here was a cement to a friendship that had been begun between the young gentlemen from likeness of manners between them and the Doctor whom they have had the goodness ever since to regard as their father And to this day it is one of the Doctor's delights to write to his worthy son Beauchamp all that he can come at relating to the life and actions of a man whom the one regards as an example the other as an honour to the human race  "It was some time before the Doctor knew for certain that the ungracious Lorimer had been consenting to the shocking treatment he had met with for the wretches whom the vile woman had suborned had made their escape from Athens before the arrival of Mr Grandison and the Chiaux the flagitious youth had written to his father in terms of the deepest sorrow an account of what had befallen his governor and his father had taken the best measures that could be fallen upon at so great a distance for  the Doctor's succour and liberty But in all probability he would have been lost before those measures could have taken effect  "Lorimer's father little thinking that his son had connived at the plot formed against his governor besought him when he had obtained his liberty not to leave his son to his own devices The Doctor as little thinking then that Lorimer had been capable of a baseness so very villainous in compassion both to father and son went to Venice and got him out of the hands of the vile women and then to Rome But there the unhappy wretch continuing his profligate courses became at last a sacrifice to his dissoluteness and his death was a deliverance to his Family to the Doctor and to the Earth  "On his deathbed he confessed the plot which the infamous courtezan had meditated against the Doctor at Venice as well as his connivance at that which she had carried into execution at Athens He died in horror not to be described begging for longer life and promising reformation on that condition The manner of his death and the crimes he confessed himself guilty of by the instigation of the most abandoned of women beside those committed against his governor so shocked and grieved the Doctor that he fell ill and his Recovery was long doubted of  "Mean time Mr Grandison visited some parts of Asia and Afric Egypt particularly corresponding all the time with Dr Bartlett and allowing the correspondence to pass into the hands of Mr Beauchamp as he did that which he held with Mr Beauchamp to be communicated to the Doctor  "When Mr Grandison returned to Italy finding there his two friends he engaged the Doctor to accompany Mr Beauchamp in that part of his tour into some of the Eastern regions which he himself had been particularly pleased with and as he said wanted to be more particularly informed of And  therefore  insisted that it should be taken at his own expence He knew that Mr Beauchamp had a stepmother who had prevailed on his father to take off twothirds of the allowance he made him on his travels  "Mr Beauchamp very reluctantly complied with the condition so generously imposed on him by his beloved friend another of whose arguments was That such a tour would be the most likely means to establish the health of a Man equally dear to both  "Mr Grandison never was at a loss for arguments to keep in countenance the persons whom he benefited and to make their acceptance of his favours appear not only to be their duty but an obligation laid on himself  "Mr Grandison himself when the two gentlemen set out on their tour was engaged in some affairs at Bologna and Florence which gave him great embarrasment  "Dr Barlett and Mr Beauchamp visited the principal islands of the Archipelago After which the Doctor left the young gentleman pursuing his course to Constantinople with intention to visit some parts of Asia and took the opportunity of a vessel that was bound for Leghorn to return thither  "His health was happily established And knowing that Mr Grandison expected the longdesired call from his father to return to England and that it was  likely  that he could be of use to his ward Miss Jervois and her affairs in her guardian's absence he was the more desirous to return to Italy  "Mr Grandison rejoiced at his arrival And soon after set out for Paris in order to attend there the expected call leaving Emily in the interim to his care  "Lorimer's father did not long survive his son He expressed himself in his last hours highly sensible of the Doctor's care of his unhappy boy and earnestly  desired his Lady to see him handsomely rewarded for his trouble But not making a will and the Lady having by her early overindulgence ruined the morals of her child never suffering him to be either corrected or chidden were his enormities ever so flagrant she bore a sacred grudge to the Doctor for his honest representations to her Lord of the young man's immoralities And not even the interposition of a Sir Charles Grandison has hitherto been able to procure the least acknowledgment to the Doctor though the loss as well of his reputation as life might have been the consequence of the faithful services he had endeavoured to render to the profligate youth and in him to the whole family"  LETTER XXXVII Dr  BARTLETT  In Continuation Inclosing the preceding  THUS far dear Miss Byron delight of every one who is so happy as to know you reach my kinsman's extracts from my papers I will add some particulars in answer to your enquiries about Mr Beauchamp if writing of a man I so greatly love I can write but a few  Mr Beauchamp is a fine young man in his person When I call him a second Sir Charles Grandison you and the Ladies and my Lord L will conceive a very high idea of his understanding politeness and other amiable qualities He is of an ancient family His father Sir Harry Beauchamp tenderly loves him and keeps him abroad equally against both their wills especially against Mr Beauchamp's now his beloved friend is in England This is done to humour an imperious vindictive woman who when a widow had cast her eyes upon the young gentleman for a  husband imagining that her great wealth her person not disagreeable would have been a temptation to him This however was unknown to the father who made his addresses to her much about the time that Mr Beauchamp had given an absolute denial perhaps with too little ceremony to an overture made to him by a friend of hers This enraged her She was resolved to be revenged on him and knowing him to be absolutely in his father's power as to fortune gave way to Sir Harry's addresses and on her obtaining such terms as in a great measure put both father and son in her power she married Sir Harry  She soon gained an absolute ascendant over her husband The son when his father first made his addresses to her was allowed to set out on his travels with an appointment of  l  a year She never rested till she had got  l  a year to be struck off and the remaining were so ill remitted that the young gentleman would have been put to the greatest difficulties had it not been for the truly friendly assistance of Mr Grandison  Yet it is said that this Lady is not destitute of some good qualities and in cases where the  son  is not the subject behaves very commendably to Sir Harry But being a managing woman and Sir Harry loving his ease she has made herself his receiver and treasurer and by that means has put it out of his power to act as paternally by his son as he is inclined to do without her knowing it  The Lady and Sir Harry both however profess to admire the character of Sir Charles Grandison from the Letters Mr Beauchamp has written from time to time to his father and from the general report in his favour And on th  s as well I as Mr Beauchamp found our hope that if Sir Charles by some unsuspected way can make himself personally acquainted  with the Lady he will be able to induce her to consent to her soninlaw's recall and to be reconciled to him the rather as there is no issue by this marriage whose interests might strengthen the Lady's animosity  Mr Beauchamp in this hope writes to Sir Charles that he can and will pay all the due respect to his father's wife and as such treat her as his mother if she will consent to his return to his native country But declares that he would stay abroad all his life rather than his father should be made unhappy by allowing of his coming over against the consent of so highspirited a woman In the mean time he proposes to set out from Vienna where he now is for Paris to be near if Sir Charles who he thinks can manage any point he undertakes and who in this will be seconded by his father's love can prevail with his motherinlaw  I long Ladies to have you all acquainted with this other excellent young man You Miss Byron I am sure in particular will admire Sir Charles Grandison's and my Beauchamp Of spirit so manly yet of manners so delicateI end as I began He is a second Sir Charles Grandison  I shall think myself Ladies very happy if I can find it in my power to oblige you by any communications you would wish to be made you But let me once more recommend it to you Lady L Lord L and Miss Grandison to throw off all reserves to the most affectionate of brothers He will have none to you in cases which he knows will give you pleasure And if he forbears of his own accord to acquaint you withs ome certain affairs it is because the issue of them is yet hidden from himself  As to Lady Olivia mentioned to you by good Lord L she never can be more to my patron than she now is  Allow me to be my good Miss Byron with a true paternal affection  Your
