 Damon and Phillida Altered from CIBBER into a COMIC OPERA With the Addition of NEW SONGS and CHORUSSES As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE  The Music entirely new composed by Mr DIBDIN  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN at Garrick's Head in Catharinestreet Strand Price s  PREFACE  MR GARRICK having allowed me as Miss Radley's master to choose what second part she should appear in I turn'd my thoughts towards the ballad farce of Damon and Phillida But when I came to look at it I not only found that the music consisted of a great many heavy minuets and old fashion'd countrydances but that there was too much dialogue without the intervention of airs which being also in blank verse rendered the drama still more tiresome as well as hurt the simplicity of some of the characters which in the idea were not contemptible add that the opening and conclusion were extremely flat and unoperatical  In order to remedy the first objection I ventured to reset some of the ballads intending out of esteem for our old melodies to let the rest remain with the addition only of modern accompanyments but here again I found the trouble would be equal to new setting the whole and I also saw that without the chance of adding any thing to my own little reputation I might lay myself open to censure by endeavouring to mend what in the opinion of many people might want no improvement  For these reasons I have composed all the songs entirely new and as the piece has never pleas'd upon the stage and for that reason has been very seldom performed since that great actress Mrs Clive was so justly celebrated in the part of Phillida I have taken the farther liberty to make such alterations in the drama as I presumed necessary  I have thrown the dialogue into prose added several new songs restored others  from Love in a Riddle inserted chorusses and whether for the better or the worse made the whole very different from what it has ever yet appeared With regard to the music I shall only say that while I have endeavoured to give light and familiar airs I have also endeavoured to give such as are neither trite nor vulgar  C DIBDIN  PERSONS  Arcas  Mr Hurst  Corydon

ARCADIA  ARCAS CORYDON CYMON MOPSUS DAMON and PHILLIDA and other Shepherds and Shepherdesses discovered ARCAS seated  CHORUS  HAIL the day ye nymphs and swains  To your plains  That gave a Lord  Who crowns the truth  Of every youth  And is defenceless Virtue's guard  ARCAS  I am told Corydon that you want my advice in something that materially concerns you  CORYDON  My Lord I have made bold to ask it  ARCAS  Then let me hear your story and whatever power I have to serve you you may freely command  CORYDON  Ah my good Lord you are our general friendThis is my daughter I have ever studied to make her happy and to own the trurh her chearful compliance with all my commands from her infancy has rendered that task a great satisfaction to me now my Lord lest I should die and leave her in an unfriendly world I would fain see her well married and for that purpose have found her out a pair of wellmeaning youths to take her choice of Cymon and Mopsus here they are brothers and their manners suit her condition I am well assured she might be happy with either of them for they both love her sincerely  CYMON  Yes an please you we are both cruelly in love  ARCAS  A little patience honest Cymon  CORYDON  These lads I say my Lord if there was no obstruction in the way might one or t'other make her a good husband perhapsbut this soppish rambling Damon here has bewitch'd her I think his squeaking pipe has rival'd both Cymon and Mopsus and they toy and play together all day long  CYMON  Ay so they do an please you  CORYDON  Nay nay Cymon  CYMON  Well well I have done I'm sure 'tis true tho'  MOPSUS  Hoh hoh hoh That fool my brother is always in the wrong  CORYDON  Nay nay Mopsus now you are worse than he  ARCAS  Go on with your story  CORYDON  So nothing now but Damon is thought of and Damon I fear will ruin her which would but ill recompence me for all my care and fatherly advice The favour I would beg of you my Lord is to interpose your authority in my behalf and though you are not our king 'tis well known you rule our hearts and the continual good you do us every day makes it but gratitude that we should yield to whatever is your pleasure therefore if you think my case deserves pity I hope your wisdom will point out to me a way to prevent any ill that may ensue from it  ARCAS  I take your grief to heart good Corydon and wish I may have it in my power to make you easy Damon you hear your accusation do you think it honest to trifle in an affair like this or that it will add to your reputation to say you purchas'd this unwary maid's affection at the price of all she possess'd for which she could be counted amiable Think seriously and tell me what I shall say I've done to right this good old man  DAMON  My Lord my professions are sincere let the girl please herself if she has a mind to marry there's her choice if she has a mind to make a frolic of life here's her man  AIR  The man for life  That takes a wife  Is like a thousand dismal things  A fox in trap  Or worse mayhap  An owl in cage that never sings  From morn till night  He hates her sight  Yet he poor soul must endure it  Bed of thorns  Head of horns  Such a life  Rope or knife  Can only cure it  A bull at stake  To merry make  He roars aloud and the laugh is strong  Like dog and cat  Or puss and rat  He fights for life and it lasts as long  But the man that's free  Is like the bee  Who ev'ry flower is tasting  Ne'er cloys  With his joys  Day or night  New delight  Is only lasting  CORYDON  You see my lord I did not accuse him falsly  ARCAS  'Tis trueWell my friends I hope your hearts are honest endeavour to rival this Damon you shan't want for my protection  CYMON  Ah Sir I have no heart to speak an like you she flouts and pouts and glouts at me from morning till night There only see how she looks now because she can't abide me  ARCAS  Take courage man pluck up a spirit that's her maiden shyness  CYMON  Do you think so SirWell if you think so I will take courage and if an old song will win her heart have at her  AIR  There's not a swain  On the plain  Would be blest as I  O cou'd you but on me smile  But you appear  So severe  That trembling with fear  My heart goes pit a pat all the while  When I cry  Must I die  You make no reply  But look shy  And with a scornful eye  Kill me with your cruelty  How can you be  So hard to me  CORYDON  Well Phillida has this no effect upon you  CYMON  No no poor Cymon thou art never the nearer not all thy songs nor sighs nor sobs can move her  ARCAS  Perhaps she may like Mopsus better come my lad let's hear what you have to say you seem chearful  MOPSUS  Yes I am always so I loves to laugh for my part let things go how they will what do I care for her frowns it gives a body's mind some ease to think that Cymon's us'd as ill as I all my comfort is that happen as it will I shall have him to laugh at  ARCAS  But now Corydon let us enquire into your daughter's heart Phillida here are three youths who labour to deserve your love tell me freely which is the man that's favour'd most by you trust me with the secret of your wishes that I may prove your friend  PHILLIDA  Since I am urg'd to speak the truth I own my heart my Lord has been foolishly imposed upon my father's will I never disobeyed and sincerely wish I had it now in my power to please him but I can never consent to lead a savage life and what could I expect better from the company of these lads  CYMON  Oh oh oh O scornful maid My poor heart will burst with grief  MOPSUS  Hoh hoh hoh poor Cymon's in a bitter taking  PHILLIDA  'Tis hard that I must chuse from such extremes of follyDamon's infidelity should make me hate him but I fear he has too many tender advocates in my heart 'tis true I have try'd a thousand times to shut him from my thoughts as often found I try'd in vain my weakness will find excuses for his treatment of me whenever he submits he's sure to be forgiven and whenever I forgive I am sure to be forsaken  AIR  What woman could do I have try'd to be free  Yet do all I can  I find that I love him and tho' he flies me  Still still he's the man  They tell me at once he to twenty will swear  When vows are so sweet who the falsehood can fear  So when you have said all you can  Stillstill he's the man  I caught him one day making love to a maid  When to him I ran  He turn'd and he kiss'd me then who could upbraid  So civil a man  The next day I found to a third he was kind  I rated him soundly he swore I was blind  So let me do all that I can  Stillstill he's the man  The shepherds all bid me beware of his art  I do what I can  But he has taken such hold of my heart  I doubt he's the man  So sweet are his kisses his looks are so kind  He may have his faults but if none I can find  Who can do more than they can  Hestill is the man  ARCAS  Take comfort Corydon your daughter's unreserved confession of her love persuades me of the goodness of her heart and tho' licentious Damon may deserve severe reproof yet for her sake let us not harden him by punishment but rather tempt him by reward to virtue my favour shall be shewn to every one who seeks by honest means to gain it therefore if he or any other swain can win this gentle maid to be his bride the portion she expected from her father I'll double on the marriage dayCome friends let's leave these lovers  CHORUS  Hail the day ye nymphs and swains  To your plains  That gave a Lord  Who crowns the truth  Of every youth  And is defenceless Virtue's guard    Exit  Arcas  Shepherds  c  CORYDON  A double portion Now my lads there's brave encouragement to warm your hearts now shew your skill now sing now dance now try which is the featest fellowAh Phillida let faithless Damon see what honesty has gain'd by truth and what his pranks have lost by wickedness  PHILLIDA  Dishonesty shall never gain me  MOPSUS  A double dow'ry Cymon now's our time  CYMON  Ah but I am tenderhearted my poor hopes will never blossom while she looks so frosty  CORYDON  Learn of your brother lad you see he's all mirth up with your heart and at her  CYMON  Shall IWell since you encourage me I will  CORYDON  Well said my boy this joyful day makes my heart bound with pleasure let me but see that graceless Damon disappointed let me but live to see him wear the willow and I'll jump into my grave with joy  AIR  When a fox for a while  Hath rejoic'd in the spoil  Which with villainous craft he hath plunder'd  And escap'd ev'ry snare  That the hounds could prepare  When alarm'd by the cries of the hundred  What pleasure at last  To see the cur fast  And grinning with pain and despair  The vallies all ring  The peasants all sing  The felon is conquer'd O rare    Exit  Corydon  DAMON  So now I suppose I shall have all my work to do over again this double dowry will turn her brain  MOPSUS  Now Cymon now  CYMON  I'd rather you speak first  MOPSUS  No you are the elder  CYMON  Ah but my heart misgives me  PHILLIDA  Still silentno kind offer from Damon  CYMON  I shall never be able to hit the tune alone  MOPSUS  Waunds you know you can well enough an you will  CYMON  I tell you I can't do you begin  MOPSUS  Well then be sure you back me  CYMON  I wull I wull  AIR  Mop  Tell me Philly tell me roundly  When you will your heart surrender  Cym  Faith and troth I love thee woundly  And I was thy first pretender  Mop  Of us boys  Cym  Take thy choice  Mop  Here's a heart  Cym  And here's a hand too  Mop  His or mine  Cym  All is thine  Both  Body and goods at thy command too  Phil  While you both pretend a passion  'Twould be cruel to chuse either  To preserve your inclination  I must kindly fix onneither  To be just I now must  Make yours and yours both equal cases  Therefore pray from this day  I never may  Behold your faces  PHILLIDA  I have heard enough of your odious love 'tis Damon's turn to speak now if he chuses it  MOPSUS  Well let him speak mayhap you'll get as little good from him as we have from you 'tisn't every man will marry you'tisn't youyoudon't cry Cymon it only makes her prouder  CYMON  She has given me such a kick of the heart I shall never get over it  PHILLIDA  How tedious is the voice of love from any but the object of our wishesCymon  CYMON  Well  PHILLIDA  Come here  CYMON  Yes  PHILLIDA  I like thee by far the better than thy brother  CYMON  Do you  PHILLIDA  I do  CYMON  O the gracious but you do truly and truly  PHILLIDA  I'll convince you on't this moment take him away and don't let me see him for an hour at least and then do you come without him  CYMON  Give me your hand on't  PHILLIDA  Hush hush not now they'll see us away with him  CYMON  A word's enough I'll do it Come Mopsus come away for I have such a thing to tell thee boy  MOPSUS  What ails the fool Thou'rt mad  CYMON  Mad Ay and so would you be too if you were in my place but come away  MOPSUS  Nay not so fast good Cymon  CYMON  Faster Mopsus faster    Exit  Mopsus  and  Cymon  DAMON  This was kind my Phillida was ever any thing so well dissembled  PHILLIDA  Yes I have learnt to dissemble from you and I suppose you'll dissemble with me again to reward me  DAMON  How suspicious you are Don't I love you This bustle at my heart when I touch your hand my transport when I gaze upon you may convince you you're mistaken  AIR  Away with suspicion  That bane to desire  The heart that loves truly all danger defies  The rules of discretion  But stifle the fire  On its merit alone true beauty relies  What a folly to tremble  Lest the lover dissemble  His fire  Turtles that woo  Bill and coo  While we enjoy we must be true  And to repeat it is all  All we can desire  PHILLIDA  Ah Damon you always have decoyed my heart with such language as this but now 'tis time to end our fooling consent to marry me or never see me again  AIR  While you pursue me  Thus to undo me  Sure ruin lies in all you say  To bring your toying  Up to enjoying  Call first the priest then name the day  Lasses are willing  As lads for billing  When marriage vows are kindly prest  Let Holy Father  Tye us together  Then bill your fill and bill your best  DAMON  What then I'm to be starved into marriage I find  PHILLIDA  I'll starve myself sooner than suffer my heart to be deluded by one whose baseness merits my scorn  DAMON  Mighty well this double dowry has strangely altered you why your brain's turn'd child and you would have me as mad as yourself make a husband of me No no Phillida I'll never be that fool to plod on in one dull path of life to be afraid to speak or look for fear I should offend in short to wear a yoke that in spite of all I can do to hinder it will last for lifeO what a thoughtYou must excuse me my dear but you'll never persuade me to think on't  PHILLIDA  False Damon I begin to hate you  DAMON  Ay there's some sense in this many of your dainty nymphs will fool one on and teaze one to death but since I know your mind adieu Phillida I am for variety  AIR  Dam  I'll range the world where freedom reigns  And scatter Love around the plains  Phil  I'll starve my love and rather part  Than yield my hand to fool my heart  Dam  The frowns of this I'll ne'er take ill  Where one denies there's two that will  Phil  Since maids by kindness are undone  Adieu mankind I'll sigh for none  Dam  No frozen lass shall hold me long  Phil  No swain that's false my love shall wrong  Dam  Farewell farewell'Tis time to part  Phil  Thus from thy hold I tear my heart  Both  Farewell farewell  c  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II SCENE I  Scene changes to a Green with a Cottage  Enter DAMON  HOW could the little gipsey carry it off with such an air I am so provoked by her impertinent pride that I shall never rest in my bed till she lies by me but let me see are her terms reasonable That my heart is subdued appears pretty plain that the object of my love is a worthy one every shepherd confesses that during our last conversation my whole behaviour was dissimulation the uneasiness I now feel will witness for me what then should I in honor and conscience do I have made the appeal and am advised to call the shepherds together and Arcas at their head to be witnesses of my conversion and my determined resolution to change the libertine to the married man  AIR  Come thou rosy dimpled boy  Source of every heartfelt joy  Haste to Phillida away  This is thine and Hymen's day  Bid her thy soft bondage wear  Bid her for Love's rites prepare  Let the nymphs with many a flow'r  Deck the rosy nuptial bow'r  Thither lead the lovely fair  And let Hymen too be there  This is thine and Hymen's day  Haste to Phillida away  Exit  Enter CORYDON and PHILLIDA from the Cottage  CORYDON  Well well but I say think no more of him  PHILLIDA  If I consent to see him no more father is not that enough  CORYDON  No no it is not you must hate him there is not such a rake among the wenches in all Arcadia he is worse than a wolf in a sheepfold or a hungry fox among poultry or a  PHILLIDA  Well but father suppose all this to be true if he could be persuaded to marry me  CORYDON  The girl puts me beyond all patience Why has not he already refused to marry you  PHILLIDA  And have not I declared against his love on that account  CORYDON  Ay but for all that he lurks about your heart I can't be easy till you have quite forgot him  PHILLIDA  I strive to forget him but if you knew what pain it gives me you would pity me  AIR  A thousand ways to wean my heart  I've try'd yet can't remove him  And tho' for life I've sworn to part  For life I find I love him  Still should the dear false man return  And with new vows pursue me  His flattering tongue would kill my scorn  And still I fear undo me  CORYDON  Consider Phillida how much it is my desire to have you married and you have your choice of Cymon and Mopsus  PHILLIDA  I do consider father and I think you should too is not a small fortune with the man I love better than to be rich and miserable  CORYDON  See yonder Cymon comes now dear Phillida for my sake smile upon him perhaps in time he may be brought to please you  PHILLIDA  I will since you desire it but Mopsus has the same right to be heard as Cymon send him too and till he comes I'll hear what his brother has to say  CORYDON  Ah Phillida you gain my heart I'll send him to you directly  AIR  Ah Philly look before you leap  No comfort in a fop you'll find  Vain are the joys you hope to reap  Love roots not in a giddy mind  Young Damon's all featherall smoke  A weathercock turn'd by each wind  The lads I preferhearts of oak  Will ever be constant and kind  Exit  Enter CYMON  AIR  Cym  Behold and see thy wounded lover  Whose truth from thee will ne'er depart  O let my tears at length discover  One gentle smile to heal my heart  Phill  Were in the world no man but Cymon  None of the female kind but I  With me shou'd end the name of woman  With thee the race of man shou'd die  CYMON  O cruel false hearted Phillida Why now didn't you say to day you loved me a good deal better than my brother Mopsus  PHILLIDA  Yes I own I told you so to get rid of you  CYMON  And don't you love me at all  PHILLIDA  Once for all I tell you no how long must I be teazed with you  CYMON  And so I have been a believing all this for nothing  AIR  Cym  O what a plague is love  I cannot bear it  What life so curst can prove  Or pain come near it  When I would tell my mind  My heart misdoubts me  Or when I speak I find  With scorn she routs me  In vain is all I say  Her answer still is nay  O dismal doleful day  Phillida flouts me  Enter MOPSUS  Mop  Ah poor Cymon dud a cry  Welladay wipe an eye O fie Phillida  To treat him so scornfully  Shamefully mournfully  Phillida fie  Phill  No no no Sir pert and dull  Simpleton paperskull I for ever shall  Think thee far the greater fool  Therefore will give thee cause  With him to cry  Cym  Toll loll loll lollnow I pray  Who has cause most to cry Ah welladay  Mop  What care I why let her scoff  I can

How are you  Mop  Why truly she treats us but so so  For my part I think she's a devil  A woman wou'd scorn for to do so  Cym  O fie fie such words are uncivil  Phill  Prepare then to hear my last sentence  Before I'd wed either much rather  I'd stand on the stool of repentance  And want for my bantling a father  Go  Cym  Oh woe I'm ready to faint  Mop  And I too  In short this won't do Mrs Vixen  For one of us two you must chuse  Phill  Then you are the man that I fix on  And you are the fool I refuse  Strikes each a box on the ear  Cym  Wounds  Phill  Go  Mop  The devil wou'd fly such a spouse  Cym  The devil wou'd fly such a spouse  Exit Mopsus  CYMON  See if I don't go and tell your daddy    Exit Cymon  PHILLIDA  Go any whereI am teazed to death with these odious wretchesO Damon how little you deserve that I should give myself so much uneasiness for you but I am born to be unhappy and must learn to endure whatever fortune chuses to inflict  Enter ARCAS DAMON SHEPHERDS c  DAMON  No Phillida you have endured enough here is your comforter and your convert convinced of my crimes lord Arcas and these shepherds will witness for me with what eagerness I have flown to make atonement for them I am ashamed of my treatment of you and with transport confirm it at your feet  AIR  See behold and see  With an eye kind and relenting  Damon now repenting  Only true to thee  Content to love and love for life  Phill  If you now sincere  With an honest declaration  Mean to prove your passion  To the purpose swear  And make at once a maid a wife  Both  Thus for life I take thee  Never to forsake thee  Soon or late we find that fate  To heart's astray directs the way  And brings to lasting joys the rover home  Enter CORYDON CYMON MOPSUS  CYMON  There didn't I say I'd tell your daddy  CORYDON  Indeed Phillida 'tis unkind to trifle with me so didn't you promise you would receive Cymon and Mopsus civilly how comes it then that you have affronted them  ARCAS  Come Corydon I hope you'll approve of all your daughter's conduct when I tell you that Damon has confessed his error and desires he may receive from you your Phillida in marriage  DAMON  I have not deserved it Sir but my Phillida shall be my advocate to you for your blessing  CORYDON  I love my child but I know you'll make her a bad husband  DAMON  You have reason to think so I own but if you'll venture such a treasure in my care as I shall ever esteem your daughter I hope my future behaviour will convince you your fears are groundless  CORYDON  Then take herI am sorry for poor Cymon and Mopsus  ARCAS  To say the truth Corydon I thought your daughter a little hardly dealt with in being pestered with their courtship but however Damon who has made her happy will I hope deserve her he shall have what I promised with her as an addition to her dower and if I am not very much deceived will prove that when a rover becomes a convert to truth reason will compleat the work by teaching him to make a good husband  AIR  DAMON  Inconstancy hence to a city or court  Where the herd of gay rakes and vain coxcombs resort  Where noise is call'd spirit where love's but a name  And where nymphs are made wretched and no one to blame  Let such a new way to be happy invent  Our way is be happy's the way to content  MOPSUS  Since things have fall'n out thus thy hand honest boy  And Philly I wish you abundance of joy  If I can't be quite happy myself I don't see  Why I should grudge others what's not meant for me  My joking and laughing old Nick shan't prevent  So happen what will I shall still be content  PHILLIDA  How smoothly the minutes henceforward will flow  Kind love will attend us wherever we go  The morning and evening their pleasures will bring  While the lark and the nightingale round us will sing  Each hour will convince us that nature has meant  The shepherd's plain life for a life of content  CORYDON  And now my dear children if happy you'd live  Attend to the connsel I'm going to give  You Phillida still be goodnatured and kind  And Damon a rover no longer you'll find  Your truth that reclaim'd him will hourly invent  Some new act of love to encrease his content  CYMON  To be serv'd such a trick 'tis a monsterous shame  To flout one and scold one and make one your game  I could cry for vexation 'sheart what shall I do  Icod there's one way and a clever one too  And so mistress Philly your malice is spent  For one smile from these friends will insure my content  END OF THE OPERA
